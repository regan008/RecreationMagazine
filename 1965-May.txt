supix added chiefly to nouns denoting
persons, but orig. to adjectives, such as

M an has always
lived in a group set-
ting which is the most powerful single
force in man’s existence. It provides him
with an outlook on life, his values, and
his loyalties. Aristotle described man
as “a social or political animal who
finds association with his fellow beings
pleasant. His physical nature and bio-
logical equipment have compelled him
to associate with his fellowman to insure
his existence, comfort, protection, and
progress.”

In earlier civilizations organized
community effort, as we know it, was
rare indeed. Communities were small
and families and neighbors helped each
other.

Social patterns change. Our modern
society is dynamic not static. Needs
must be met by group action if we are
to protect the community as a whole.
Arnold Toynbee said, “The twentieth
century may be best remembered as the
first age in history in which people have
thought it practical to make the bene-
fits of civilization available for the
whole human race.”

Activities and services that were for-
merly the responsibility of a family or
small groups of individuals have now
become matters of national, state,
county, or municipal concern. The rec-
reation movement is an excellent ex-
ample of community organization for a

substitute for the once available vacant

Redwood crisis: What we rescue today, this hour, this very minute,
is the most that can ever be saved—hopefully by means of a new
national area. These giant trees grow nowhere else on this earth.

HE PRIMEVAL stands of redwoods,

found in California and nowhere
else, are one of the most treasured plant
types and one of the natural wonders
of the world. They are among the old—
est of all living things—with many
reaching a thousand years and a few
exceeding two thousand years. Rising
from the fern-covered forest floor,
along the fog-shrouded and rain-
drenched Pacific Coast, many grow
higher than a twenty-story oihce build-
ing—to create a forest scene of natural
beauty unexcelled anywhere else on

earth. Nonetheless, the California

216

Highway Commission has adopted a
route for freeway construction through
these memorial groves, even though
some are state parks.

Despite public outcry, the commis-
sion is pushing ahead. Already many of
the giants have been cleared away; and,
in addition, timber companies are buy-
ing the acreage that is left, setting up
new logging camps and moving in the
chain saws. Many groves have been
wiped out.

ing more should send’rfor the Sierra

} OPPOSITION to President Johnson’s
plan for a national redwood park in two
northern California coastal counties
was expressed in two alternate propos-
als made by the California State Re-
sources Agency. One alternative calls
for a “national parkway” instead of the
traditional type park. The other calls
for a park site different than that pro-
posed by the federal government. The
federal proposal is for a park that would
include areas of Humboldt and Del
N orte Counties, including the Redwood
Creek watershed with its primeval red-
woods in Humboldt County. { F or more

P REPORT ON PERFORMING ARTS in the
U.S. Only in our time have we begun
to recognize the arts as a community

concern—John D. Rockefeller 3rd. A

group of citizens from all parts of the
country who are identified with many
segments of American life were asked
by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, in
1963, to join in a study of the future
development and support of the per-
forming arts in the United States. Their
report, The Performing Arts—Prob-
lems and Prospects, has just been pub-
lished by McGraw-Hill Book Company
and is now available from the publisher
for $1.95 (paperback).

A preface signed by the Rockefeller
Panel states, “In this report, we hope
to engage the attention of the American
people and to waken their concern
about the performing arts in the United
States. For, in spite of tremendous
growth and exciting promise, the per-
forming arts as we see them today are
in trouble.” The report presents some
of the problems facing the arts, pro-
moting public discussion and action.

’ NEW REGULATION: If you are regis-
tering with the National Recreation As-
sociation Personnel Placement Service,
send for the standard personnel form.
When returning it, a $5.00 registration
fee should accompany your application
which helps to pay the cost of collect-
ing, assembling and preparing your
credentials for photographing. This fee
is paid only once and does not have to
be renewed.

The Association’s personnel files
serve two purposes: (1) providing a
national central clearing house for the

records of those professional recreation
persons who are actively engaged in the
practice of recreation leadership, and
(2) maintaining an accurate file of
qualifications and interests of persons
who would like to consider new assign-
ments in recreation. Even when not in-
terested in placement, you should write
to Recreation Personnel Service to
keep your record up-to-date.

) TRENDS AND PORTENTS. Recreation
leaders do not need a crystal ball to
peer into the future. They have only to
look at a few signs of the times and
grasp their far-reaching implications
for an age of ever-expanding leisure.
Consider the impact on the recreation
profession of the following facts:

0 Culture is the latest big business in
the country, declares The New York
Times in its National Economic Review
supplement of January 11, 1965. “Last
year’s three billion dollar market will
double itself by 1970, if not sooner,
the experts predict. From 1953 to 1960,
spending on the arts rose about 130
percent. . . . Interest in culture . . . has
become the newest status symbol, and
conspicuous esthetics may become the
norm, to the surprise of no one.”

0 Book publishers had a record year
in 1964 with sales receipts five to ten
percent above the previous record year

of 1963. Total sales were over $1,800,-
000,000.

0 American industry spends about
$1,500,000,000 annually on employe
recreation programs and recreation fa-
cilities. Business concerns now own
125 golf courses and buy more sports

"ow voluntarism

as it relates

to services to the aging

is going through dramatic
changes

after visiting our country in 1825, wrote: “As soon as
several inhabitants of the United States have taken up an
opinion or a feeling that they wish to promote in the world
they look for mutual assistance. As soon as they have found
each other out they combine. From that moment on they
are no longer isolated men.”

There is a story about the little child who got lost in a
huge field of wheat and whose wails for help were stilled
by exhaustion before he was missed. The townspeople be-
gan to trample the wheat field frantically in search of the
youngster until someone suggested that they all line up at
one edge of the field, clasp hands, and proceed methodically
through it. The wheat suffered no further damage-——and
the child was found. Everyone in that long human chain
contributed the span of his reach to the rescue. As De Toc-
queville observed about Americans, they tackled the job
together and were not isolated men.

The value of each person in this human chain was in-
creased as he voluntarily agreed to become a part of a com-
munity project. Voluntarism, given so frequently on a regu-
lar stipulated time basis, is quite unique in this country.
Not only De Tocqueville but many foreign visitors are im-
pressed by the extent and the continuity of our voluntary
efforts. Voluntary efforts took root when the pilgrim fathers
set the pattern of voluntary common effort for the common
well-being. From that day, voluntarism has never left us;
nay, it has grown to tremendous proportions. The desire
to be helpful, of putting into operation the religious injunc-
tion of being your brother’s keeper, the great desire to be
helpful to your neighbor. from helping him build his barn
to pushing his car out of a snow-drift, has been strengthened
with each succeeding generation.

Voluntarism as it relates to services to the aging is going
through some dramatic changes. Until recently much of
the emphasis was on serving the older personr—-finding a
friendly visitor, transporting the older person to the hospi-
tal, volunteering services in homes for the aged or in centers.
lt was younger people doing something [or older people.

REMEMBRANCE OF
THINGS PAST

NOT ONLY do retired citizens have ex-
perience and skills to volunteer
for community service projects but
they have another priceless asset to
contribute in their remembrance of
things past. Senior citizens are sharing
these precious memories with their
communities in some interesting proj-
ects across the country, to give future
generations a real sense of heritage.
Other projects are also demonstrating
the many ways older citizens can make
much needed contributions to their
communities. These projects are cited
by the Office of Aging of the US. De-

partment of Health, Education, and
Welfare as examples of what can be

expected of senior citizens anywhere
in the country, in big cities, small
towns, or even in a neighborhood area.
0 In some New York City schools, older
residents are providing students with
eyewitness accounts of what life in this
country was like before the invention
and development of everything young
people take for granted today—before
TV, before radio, before the airplane,
even before the automobile. They have
proved exceedingly popular teachers
and their “classes” have opened many
somewhat blase young eyes.

leisure,” and to provide opportunities
for useful and creative roles has been
brewing for a number of years. Two
years ago Mayor Jerome P. Cavanagh
created a departmental Council on Ag-
ing to explore the needs of the city’s
160,000 men and women aged sixty-five
or over, to channel these needs to the
right departments and agencies for ac-
tion, to improve existing programs and
develop new ones. He appointed heads
of the Housing Commission, Welfare
Department, Public Library, Civil
Service, Detroit Street Railways, Uni-
ted Foundation, and Parks and Recrea-
tion to serve on the council. Subse-
quently, a coordinator was named to
plan future programs which would in-
volve all city departments as well as
private agencies, churches, and state
government—all to work together on a
common problem.

The Detroit plan to change attitudes
and get rid of stereotyped images of
old age is to open a network of multi-
servicc centers throughout the city.
Education and recreation programs are
offered five days a week under the
supervision of parks and recreation
personnel and others with special skills.
These centers are also to serve as refer-
ral centers where seniors get help on
personal problems. Caseworkers. so-
cial workers, and nurses are to be
brought into the program to work on a
part time basis. All centers are to be
within walking distance or near a bus
stop.

ation centers designed to handle large
or small groups. Senior programs are
already being held in twenty-one of
them. More programs and more build-
ings will be added as needed. Plans are
to use public libraries, housing facili-
ties, health centers. One new multi-
purpose building is being constructed
at one of the housing projects.

Other things “on the fire” are forums,
workshops, and education programs
for potential senior leaders. As time
goes on, there will be an increasing de-
mand for them. Still others are pro-
grams to teach young people to use
their leisure time wisely in preparation
for retirement years, campaigns to get
seniors to take part in community-serv-
ice projects, and to get educational in-
stitutions to offer comprehensive
courses to train professional leaders for
these multi-servicc centers.

In Detroit there’s no need for any of
the older citizens to feel unloved, un-
wanted, unimportant.—-PAULINt—I STERL-

FI‘HE Philadelphia Center for Older

People has been conducting a
summer day camp since 1959 for its
members. For the last few years. guests
of the Stephen Smith Home for the
Aged in Philadelphia have joined them.
The camp is now subsidized by the
Philadelphia Foundation which picks

up the largest share of the cost. as»

221

In 1963, the center offered twelve
trips to four different states———eight to
Pennsylvania, two to New Jersey, one
to Maryland, and one to Delaware. The
average daily attendance was ninety-
four. Two hundred different individuals
participated in the outings, and 1,203
meals were served in the twelve days of
day camp.

Members paid $2.75 a week for three
trips which included noonday meals
and afternoon snacks. The eager travel-
ers lined up on the sidewalk in front of
the center often an hour before bus
departure time.

A wheelchair from the Arthritis
Foundation was folded and taken
aboard the bus each day. It was very
useful when members tired or needed
a booster ride going up a hill. How-
ever, many of the older people showed
surprising agility, even riding the
horses on a carrousel at an amusement
park, the whip, the airplane, and the
roller coaster.

Ocean City was a real treat for some
who had not been to the seashore in
twenty years. One person, who had not
taken a trip out of Philadelphia in five
years, was ecstatic over a stroll on the
boardwalk. This trip was so popular
that two station wagons accompanied
the two buses, and 114 people enjoyed
the outing. To make it even more of a
“feast day,” the menu included fried
chicken.

The Center has recently published a
new brochure to celebrate its fifteenth
anniversary. Copies of this, plus a
financial statement and other informa-
tion, may be secured by sending a self-

addressed, stamped envelope to the

NEW VISTAS

THE Travelwenders Club of Bellaire,

Texas, in the greater Houston
area, is really going places. The recre-
ation department, in cooperation with
the Gray Line Touring Service, offers
monthly excursions to points of interest
around the greater Texas Gulf coast to
senior citizens in the area. The organ-
ization meets twice a month in the Bell-

222

aire Community Building. The hrst
meeting is devoted to guest speakers,
businessmen, clergy, and civic leaders.
Travel films are shown and plans are
laid for future tours. The second meet-
ing is the tour itself. These excursions
are made to points of interest within
the surrounding area. All tours are
planned so no one must spend the night
away from home. They average from
four to seven hours in length. Excur-
sions are made on luxury, air-condi-
tioned type buses, with trained nar-
rators on board.

This section of Texas is fortunate in
that it possesses countless places of in-
terest, as well as natural landmarks If
one has never seen the wonders of a
large modern hotel kitchen, the press
room of a metropolitan newspaper, the
check-processing equipment of a large
bank, whole new vistas open up in
seemingly everyday activities. Bellaire
is able to offer its retired citizens a
chance to see these things at nominal
cost. The only charge is the fee which
the touring service places on the ex-
cursion. This naturally varies accord-
ing to the tour.

This program was the brainchild of
Vera Saxenmeyer, who is employed as
a secretary by the Gulf Oil Company
and is attending the University of
Houston at night. A real need is being
met by giving these retired citizens a
chance to use their still active and in-
quiring minds. They are eager, re-
ceptive, and, above all, openly grateful
for this opportunity that their com-
munity has presented them. — D. L.

O’KEEFE, Director of Parks and Rec-
reation, Bellaire, Texas.

tivities. \Vith this In mind, a “kitchen
band” was organized in the early
spring of 1964. A meeting was held
with the ladies showing an interest in
forming such a musical group. One of
the senior-center ladies was selected as
director of the band with a recreation
leader as advisor. Since the purpose of
this band was to provide fun as well as
entertainment, the band was named the
“Humbug Band.”

The ladies were asked to bring in
novelty instrument ideas. Some very
ingenious instruments were made from
small kitchen utensils attached to ka-
zoos. Many of the ladies raided their
grandchildren’s toy boxes. These in-
struments have become the nucleus of
the kitchen hand. Several new instru-
ments have been made and added to the
band. The ladies are always bringing
in new ideas—some very original. The
band has expanded to twenty-four lad-
ies, with a waiting list. As new instru-
ments are added, the band grows larger.

The group first met for one hour
each week, and after weeks of rehears-
als, performed before an audience. The
band was applauded enthusiastically
and accepted as a part of the center
program. The members willingly prac-
tice and perform for many of their
centers’ special programs. Flag Day,

Young bike riders should learn the rights and wrongs of way

should be examined for mechanical safety. The dia-

look for loose handlebars, defective handgrips, loose seat,
wheel loose at the hub, loose mudguards, defective or im-
properly adjusted spokes, warped rim that rubs against
fork, worn or shaky steering post, worn-out pedal treads,
defective pedals, drive chain that is too loose or too tight,
and defective coaster brakes. Be sure the bicycle meets
ordinance specifications in regard to headlight, rear re-
flector, horn (or bell) and brakes. Any attachment added
to the bicycle, such as a luggage carrier or basket, should
be securely fastened and in good working order. In addition,
the rider should be given a written or oral test on traffic
rules and safe-riding practices. Suggested questions (with

’ 5K ANYONE you meet “What is a park?” and you will

njoy themselves out-of-doors during leisure time.

we focus our attention on city parks, however, the for-
delinition becomes pertinent, “a piece of ground kept

lives of the residents of the city, as well as those comn‘luting
or visiting the city, are enriched and uplifted b) the esthetic
qualities of these gifts provided so abundantly by nature
which can be utilized by man to rich advantage.

RECREATION, another facet of the city park picture, is
- universal and also means various things to various
people, depending upon age, interest, skill-level, environ-
ment, and background. Recreation is individual. It is a
time set aside which is controlled or scheduled by the indivi-
dual, according to his or her own interests and abilities for
use of leisure time. This is a time-off period from the hustle
and bustle of daily livinn'. This is a time when it is not
necessary to perform any required task, whether it is on
the job, at home. or elsewhere. This is the only time one
schedules to his liking.
Recreation in its broadest sense may even mean inactivity
just doing nothing or just sitting enjoying the subtle
beauty of a flower garden or marvelling at a sunset through
the trees. This is inactive or passive recreation which many
enjoy~ “‘refreslunent of strength and the spirit after toil."
as Webster phrases it.

However, more often recreation in parks means active
play, which contributes prin'larily to the physical well-being
of the participant. Usually this is accomplished in super-
vised or organized games, such as playing ball. pitching
horseshoes. and other team events. Therefore, our parks
must serve at least a dual capacity: they must contribute
to the perst‘in’s physical and spiritual well-being and to his
esthetic side as well. In total. the} must contribute to the
recreation or development and unfoldment of the whole
man.

In the (lesign of our city parks and playgrounds. the
esthetic quality inherent in an area must be. utilized to its
fullest extent. whether it is a stream. a grove of trees. or its

225

topography. These assets must be recognized and evaluated
in the total landscape scheme and preserved and protected,
whenever and wherever possible, and enhanced if possible.
In designing a placement of structures and areas for games
it is necessary to have a solid conviction that beauty need
not be sacrificed to make it functional and to try and avoid
inducement of vandalism. [See “Planning Play Areas” and
“Super-Block Play Areas,” RECREATION, April, 1965.]

Granted, the designer has his initiative and imagination
taxed to the fullest when he attempts to introduce amenities
into the layout of a ball diamond with its backstop, skin
area, and bleachers; the designing of a football field with
its goalposts; a hard-surface court with its appurtenances;
or just an area with playground equipment. However, this
can be accomplished, especially if the area is large enough
to support the use for which it is intended, and it is being
accomplished in many places. Those who come to play or
attend the game enjoy themselves more, consciously or un-
consciously, because of pleasant landscape and surround-
ings in which the game is played.

There are some who hold the view that a small plot is
sufficient in the growing neighborhood, a few facilities are
adequate to serve the participants, and there is little or
nothing more desired or required in what our parks and
playgrounds should provide. Therefore, let us examine
what our parks and playgrounds are and can be, or should
provide for our people, for parks are for people. It will be
just touched on briefly but it is sure that the significance of
these functions will be readily grasped. Parks are over and
beyond just an area and facilities for active recreation.

W HENEVER POSSIBLE in acquiring an area for park and

playground purposes, the area should be of sufficient
size so the active recreation facilities can be designed
within the landscaped park rather than to have it become
necessary to develop the entire area into active recreation
as a playfield. A park should encompass all recreation
activities intended whether active or passive.

Another changing aspect of parks and their functions is
the school-park concept. This is the consolidation of park
and recreation areas and facilities within the area and faci-
lities of the school in a given neighborhood or city.

The reasons for the trend toward amalgamation of the
school and park throughout the country are many. It avoids
costly duplication of facilities and promotes eiiicient use of
park and school recreation facilities.

Where it is feasible or necessary to establish a school in
a certain area, neighborhood, or small community, it is
reasonable to assume that there is also a necessity for a
park in the same area. Therefore, planning is very impor-
tant. The result is a school and playground within a land-
scaped park with all necessary physical, education, and
recreation facilities close at hand for the participants.
Whenever the area is large enough to support landscaping,
it can be so designed as to quiet the noise of the robust ac-
tivities by screening out much of the noise by the use of
plant material. This area will lend itself to passive recreation.

As the population increases, property values also increase
and it becomes increasingly more difiicult to acquire prop-

226

erty in a given area. By proper consolidation and ad
planning of school-park areas, procedures for the ac
tion of land within a given area can commence well i
vance of the construction of residences within the ar
is much more feasible and less costly to acquire a p
land suitable and large enough for a school and park
to the construction of homes within the area than to a
it after construction of homes has begun.

One of the first cities to inaugurate and develop the 5
park concept was Glencoe, Illinois. The results were w
by many citizens, cities, and communities. In 1948,
neapolis, through the continual efforts of its superint
of parks, Charles E. Doell, developed its first schoo
combination in the Waite Park School and Park. Sin

Says 0113 Kali Kok, deputy director of the Peoples’ Asso-

not merely a place where people meet for the purpose of

with the unwritten rules of sportsmanship and acceptable
group standards and values. We think of our 188 centers
as a challenge to intelligent and responsible leadership. Our
centers are links in the chain that bind us into one united
people of Malaysia.”

These comments by Mr. Ong were made to the park and
recreation administrators of the cities and the school dis-
tricts of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles during his brief
tour of California communities last fall. His study of Ameri-

federation of his State of Singapore with Malaya, Sabah,
and Sarawak into the new Malaysia federation of over
eleven million people.

Leisure presents itself as a problem to most of the people
of Singapore, whose daily chores add up to strains and
stresses in their physical, mental, and emotional stability,
according to Mr. Ong who has been associated with com-
munity recreation in that government since 1958. He points
out that some of the people think it best to go to sleep and
forget many of the painful incidents that occurred during
the day. A few spend their leisure hours drowning their in-
dividual conflicts in drink. The recent riots in Singapore
might suggest that a minority wish to Spend their leisure
by trying to make their neighbors uncomfortable and their
lives inconvenient and difficult. A portion of the population
believes that leisure is a waste, and many bustle about try-
ing to convert every minute into dollars and cents. Gen-
erally, however, people at leisure in the tip of southeast
Asia seek the companionship of their fellows in some form
of common activity or experience which relieves them from
the humdrum daily routine.

HE ESTABLISHMENT of the Peoples’ Association, as a
T statutory authority for community recreation, was ac-
complished in 1960 under the leadership of Lee Quan Yew,
Singapore’s young premier. He serves as chairman of the
association’s eleven-member administrative board. Among
the board members are the ministers of finance and of labor
and law. Objects of the corporation, which serves the island
area of 390 square miles, include the following:

“The organization and promotion of group participation
in social, cultural, education and athletic activities in order
that the youth of Singapore may be made to realize that
they belong not to any particular racial or religious com-
munity but to a Malayan community, which transcends
communal and racial loyalities.”

Funds allocated by the government for community rec-
reation in 1963-64 amounted to 3,500,000 Singapore dollars
($1,167,000, U.S.) for the development of land and facili-
ties and the operation of community centers and youth
clubs. Annual per capita expenditure which approximates
sixty U.S. cents does not include public funds expended
for the operation of several parks, five swimming pools,
public beaches, nine holiday camps, and sport fields.

As a graduate of the University of Malaya in the field of
social work, Mr. Ong is cognizant of the value of neighbor-
hood-centered facilities and programs. One community
center for every ten thousand people provides children,
youth and adults with the welcome resources of space, facili-
ties, and equipment, and the advantages of trained leaders.

A major factor in the state’s recreation plan is the assist-
ance provided by twenty-six national voluntary organiza-
tions concerned with drama, ballet, music, literature,
photography, and twelve different sports. Among these
groups are the student associations (referred to in Singa—
pore as “student unions”) of universities, colleges and
secondary schools. This long-standing interest of Singa-
pore’s voluntary associations in organized recreation pro-
grams played a prominent role in the decision of The Asia

ADMINISTRATION

The latter types of facilities present special problems
which may be more complex than those which arise in the
planning and construction of indoor theaters for adults.
New technologies, nevertheless, can be applied to their solu-
tion. We are mindful that ancient Greek theaters were out-
door arenas, and that park and recreation systems have
been carrying on in the Greek tradition for a long period
Of time. Therefore, park and recreation departments should
have a special interest in latest concepts in theater technolo-
gy, as many are directly concerned with outdoor and mobile

 

facilities.

A theater, in the minds of most, is a building in which
an audience facing a stage up front watches a play or film
through an Opening called the proscenium arch. This pic-
ture-frame opening separates audience and playing areas
when the curtain is drawn. Modern theater designers, no
longer content with a proscenium stage—*and they are not
alone in their discontent—are developing a variety of
new theater forms. Arena staging, for example, although
not basically new, is used with greater Hexibility in order
to bring audience and players into a more communicative
relationship. Recreation leaders may take pride in the fact
that the new concepts of an arena theater received an early
impetus from the work of the late Margo Jones at the Dallas
Playhouse. Miss Jones, prior to going to Dallas, was drama
director for the Park and Recreation Department in Hous-
ton, Texas.

The renaissance Of live theater is worldwide in scope.
Thomas de Gaetani, managing director of theaters and con-
cert halls for New York City’s Lincoln Center, speaking be-
fore a recent meeting of the International Association of
Theatre Technicians, indicated its scope in the United
States. He reported that the United States now has three
thousand community theater groups, twenty-eight hundred
college and university theater programs, and that, during
the next decade, three thousand theaters will have been com-
pleted in schools, colleges, universities, and other institu-
tions throughout the nation.

The multiplication of living theaters offers the architect,
the technician, the director, the playwright, and all others
associated with the theater Opportunities to apply new con-
cepts, designs, materials, technical equipment and devices,
and a host of techniques hitherto in an embryonic state of
progress or nonexistent.

If there is one outstanding and exciting feature of today’s
renaissance of living theater it is the sense and spirit of
striving for a theater that has a place which is here and
a time which is now. The Ford Foundation project, “The
Ideal Theater,” and GrOpius’ “total theater” show how seri-
ously the problems are being attacked from all sides and
the high degree of creative imagination that is going into
their solution.

The diagrams on Page 232 used by the U.S. Institute Of
Theatre Technology in its current theater survey indicate
some of the basic possibilities of audience and stage rela-
tionships. It can be seen that a relationship of one type or

form.

nonprofessionals. To clarify the situation, Richard

Theatre Technicians and the Association of British ‘
Technicians, has the following capsule descriptions

ffames Hull Miller, designer of the Theatre of Western

‘oeiation of Theatre Technicians in 1962, had the fol-
'ing to say about community theater: “What is required

certs, with audiences up to four or five hundred. It must

‘ r. Miller chose the open stage (end-stage), including
ward platform as shown in the diagram on Page 232.
‘cribing the theater in further detail, he pointed out that
type of stage “creates a highly dimensional acting area”
“an environment where a number of set pieces can be
nged in space in many simultaneous patterns"; and
hermore, “the near stadium slope makes possible a

The Loeb Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, may be

the United States (see diagram). The building committee
states that, “We see the building as an opportunity, not a
fixed dehnition, as a working instrument, and not as a
separate institute. We see a theater flexible and spacious. so
constructed that it can adapt itself to future techniques. . . .”

Quoting from Mr. de Caetani’s description, “The theater
shape is predicated on that of an audience seated in front
of an unframed stage. \Vhen a ‘picture frame‘ is needed, a
series of panels are moved along ceiling tracks to provide

“The third variation brings into play this theater’s electro-

DUCATIONAL dramatics for children are of funda-
mental importance. The dramatic instinct of

the child is very near the surface—is very free. To
foster this instinct, to provide the child with a means
for self-expression which will not stifle spontaneity
nor thwart personality but will stimulate the imagi-
nation and develop inner resources—this is vital and

far reaching—JANE HOLLINGTON, children’s drama
specialist.

 

trating the limitations of stage, light, sound equipment,
effective seating, and lack of other facilities can be.
Leaders in the park and recreation field now have an op-
portunity to use their influential position to update and
modernize outdoor theater facilities. A program of action

would do much to improve the outdoor cultural life of com-
munities immensely.

THE CONDITION of children’s theater continues to be al-
most entirely neglected despite the substantial rise of
children’s theater activity everywhere. Most facilities are
still make-d0. Performing children’s theater in them is like
running a nursery program in a high school. Theaters are
not designed for children with the few exceptions previously
noted. Somehow, sometime, communities must design the-
aters expressly for children’s theater performances and cre-
ative dramatics. They are long overdue. Recreation and
parks might well be the vehicles for pioneering work in
children’s theater facility developments.

Mobile units as indicated in the September 1960 issue of
RECREATION Magazine serve a number of purposes in the
recreation drama program. Puppet shows, children’s thea-
ter performance, talent and variety shows, and other types
of performances are transported on these vehicles to various

sections of the community. Joseph Papp conveys his pro-

fessional Shakespeare performances to playgrounds and
parks of New York City in three units used respectively for

scenery and props, seating, and stage and dressing rooms.

Several advanced experimental designs have been de-

veloped, but have not yet got off the drawing boards. Most
plans have been locally devised and realized with varying
results. It would seem that recreation and parks have a
special reason for devoting serious efforts to improving

mobile theater units, and for using them more extensively.

Recreation and park departments will undoubtedly be-
come increasingly involved in the exciting and widespread
innovation in theater design. Their special concern would
apparently he most active in seeking to apply modern tech-
nological knowledge of design materials and equipment to
outdoor theaters, children’s theaters for children’s theater
performances and creative dramatics, and the extension of

mobile theater units toward more serviceable ends.#

ests were simple and participation by
the public could be assumed. In some
connnunities in the small or rural areas,
this picture still exists. For the most
part, however, community recreation
as a public service in our cities and
today faces a

sprawling suburbia

tougher challenge.

Especially in the larger and older
cities, recreation tastes, even among
children have become more sOphisti-
cated. The public recreation program
competes with TV programs, mass spec-
tator sports, and many increasingly di-
verse types of commerical recreation.
There is diffusion of interest in many
directions. The attention of the people
is diliicult to capture and hold. Public-
relations counseling with the aim of
selling goods or ideas, has become big
business. It is in this environment that
cosponsorship of activities can help-
fully serve a “Trojan Horse” role. We
must reach the people where they are.
As the old adage states, “If you can’t
lick ’em, join ’eml”

In successful cosponsorship it is im-
portant to study out the ground. One
should know existing groups, their
leaders, and the interests they favor. In
most cities today, civic and service clubs
are organized and meet regularly. Many
service clubs have national objectives
paralleling the aims of public recreation
in children and youth work. Some favor
programs for older persons. Hobby
groups of various types are active.
Many of these are autonomous groups
centered about cultural, social, and

 

athletic interests. Their aims and ob-
jectives are beneficial and consistent
with public recreation goals and stand-
ards.

The hobby groups frequently tend to
become selective and are sometimes
ingrown. Do we not all know an art
cluh self-engrossed and talented, a
group of stamp or coin collectors with
self-centered enthusiasm for their own
collections; a camera club exchanging
technical tricks among themselves? The
chief interest of these groups is to ex-
press their own talents. They often have
much that can be contributed to the
community. How do we then break
into the circle and use their group to
open doors of interest for a wider
group? How do we capture these
special-interest persons and enlist their
leadership for larger service?

Cosponsorship can be our Trojan
Horse. We enter their area of activity.
We may begin by undertaking an ex-
hibit, a tea, an open house, a hobby
show. A cosponsored creative hobbies
night for instance, with live demonstra-
tors, may lead directly to new classes
and new leaders.

In this process we may reach and
serve a new group of taxpayers. While
some organizations are entirely inde-
pendent, others may welcome a loose
afiiliation with the recreation program.
Most of these groups are noncommer-
cial and some operate on limited re-
sources. Any reduction in their over-
head costs may be a welcome help. It
may be helpful to the group to offer
help with the agenda, to assist with
promotional fliers and secretarial serv-
ices, and to suggest new program ideas.

S om: MIGHT CONTEND that recreation
tends to lose identity in this pro-
cedure, because the role of the recrea-
tion department is preferably unobtru-
sive and efficient. We may suggest, aid,
abet. explore and guide, but we do not
dominate, neither do we threaten the

autonomy of the cosponsor. It is also
important that we do give credit.

The strength which can develop
through cosponsorship is a grass-roots
strength. The recreation department
acts chiefly as a catalyst, an enabler.
The end result is a breaking down of
walls of indifference and small view-

East Orange

A new concept of combined education and recreation facilities, a centra-
cated education plaza, has been proposed by the East Orange, New Jersey,
of Education. This is a step in coping with an increasingly congested urba
“to provide educational opportunity of highest caliber . . . and a cultural,
tional, and enrichment center for the entire community.” Education leade
pose that this be achieved over a period of fifteen years. The centrally l
area will consist of fifteen acres. On these will be constructed a number of
ings to which all the school children of the city will be brought. The pl
structure of the plaza is planned to permit and encourage the developme
program which fits all kinds of pupils. The concept is further described and
ings of plans presented in a booklet, The East Orange Education Plaza, 
Capies are available from the Board of Education, East Orange, New fer

Will the advantages of the East Orange plan outweigh its deficiencies?

performing one of their most import-

The elementary school should be a
neighborhood center as well as a school.
While neither the educators nor the
people as a whole have fully realized
the potentialities of the elementary
schools as neighborhood centers, the
need for them to serve in this capacity
is becoming greater every day. For the
school to be a neighborhood center, it
must he a recreation and cultural cen-

the entire neighborhood population.
The school building should be the prin-

facilities needed for the entire popula-

tion as well as for the school should be
provided in the school'building.

NOTES FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR

Multiplicity
SPECIAL public service districE, now numbering over
eighteen thousand, should be subject to stringent con-
trol by state, city, and county governments, according to
a report entitled The Problem of Special Districts in
American Government, issued recently by the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. The report
reviews the operations of special districts and public au-
thorities, ranging in size from the mammoth Port of New
York Authority to the smallest volunteer fire protection
district, in terms of their relation to local government.
While such districts often provide useful governmental
services, the commission found that too many of them were
being created and they continue to operate deSpite their
adverse effect on local government generally.

The commission is a permanent, bipartisan body created
by the Congress to give continuing study to the interrela-
tionships among local, state, and national levels of govern-
ment. Its twenty-six members are drawn from state, city,
and county governments, as well as the Congress and the
Executive Branch of the national government.

The report reviews the procedures for the creation of
special districts and goes into their financial activities.
These districts, while spending over $3,000,000,000 an-
nually, and having outstanding long term indebtedness of
over $10,000,000,000, are often subject to almost no control
either by the people themselves or by elected public ofiicials.

Perhaps the greatest problem stemming from the ex-
istence of the multiplicity of special districts is that it is
often impossible for the people, despite their initial role
in creating special districts, to effectively call to account
those responsible for providing government services. For
example, in a given area, as many as eight districts—four
governed by elected boards of directors, four by appointed
boards of directors—plus a city and a county, all may have
responsibility for providing various government services.
In such a case, how can the individual citizen with his re-
sponsibilities to home, family, and work keep up with them?

of the types of one's opportunities while
growing up. Changing an attitude can
be dangerous unless the new one is not
just new, but better.

Traditional ways of living, and atti-
tudes toward life and leisure, are no
longer valid. A major problem for all
of us is how to cushion change for the
older and the retired adult, and how to
educate the present and coming genera-
tions in an attitude toward leisure and
retirement that is one of relaxed antici-
pation; a looking forward to new op-
portunities for creative self-expression,
richer personal relationships, and in-
creased service to others.

Dr. William Menninger says that
people who stay young despite their
years do so because of an active interest
that provides a satisfaction through
participation. Life cannot be lived from
the sidelines. Many of those who join
the ranks of the retired do so with re-
luctance and resignation. For, in our
youth-worshipping and production-ori-
ented society, the land-of—leisure is
largely unexplored territory to the older
person. Here, the time patterns of life
no longer create the same design. The
daily routine no longer has the security
of large blocks of time filled by a famil-
iar work schedule.

Suddenly, almost without realizing it,
and sometimes without accepting it for
real, the work-rhythm is broken. The
ticking of the clock no longer has the
same significance. Personal relation-
ships born and bred on the job are
changed or broken. When life has been
wrapped around a work core. the mean-
ing of life shrivels when that core is re-
moved.

A minister once said, “We had lots
of sins in our little white-steepled
churches, but I remember in my own
the most serious was dancing, the next
was cigarettes, and the third was sitting

-   Education for retirement is a relatively new field of great potential

down.” Many people still feel guilty if
they are not working at something.

In pre-industrial societies, most
adults were concerned in earning a liv-
ing as long as their relatively short life
lasted. Today, the middle-aged-to-older
worker has more free time than time
spent on the job. His problem is that he
does not realize the importance of it.
He does not realize that free time will
take the place, eventually, of his work
time, and so he does not go about delib-
erately to plan for it, to prepare to turn
this leisure into an annuity against the
poverty of spirit and the poverty of
heart that are just as terrible as eco-
nomic poverty.

The 1961 White House Conference
on the Aging tells us that the average
person when he retires at sixty-five, re-
ceives a gift of an additional thirty
thousand hours of time to use as he
wishes. This is not always a welcome
gift.

In our production-oriented society,
more output by fewer workers will make
education for leisure a very important,
if not the most important, problem to
be solved. Regardless of how often you
have heard it talked about, this new
problem is a fact, requiring new meth-
ods. new phiIOSOphies and, most of all,
ncw attitudes.

Attitudes are formed very early, and,
as they crystallize into habits of thought
and behavior, they are harder and hard-
er to break. Psychologists tell us that
dogs can learn new tricks—the hard
thing is to break them of old tricks. So
it is with our attitudes toward retire-
ment. toward old age. and toward lei-
sure.

People’s needs change very little, but
opportunities to fill such needs can de-
cline with age. We all need to love and
be loved, but friends die, families grow
up. and become separated. We all need

239

to do some useful work, but retirement
takes away the big time blocks of work.
We all need to feel that we have a place
in the world, but we fail to see the many
opportunities around us to be useful.
For basic existence, we all need shel-
ter, health, and financial resources.
These are the bread in the wise state-
ment “Man cannot live by bread alone.”
For social and psychological health,
other basics must be added:
Usefulness, which gives us a reason
for living, encourages us to be givers,
not takers.
Challenge, to keep our responses alive
and active.
Affiliation, to feel a part of the group
with interesting social give and take, to
keep us out of selfish self-pity.
Satisfaction, to feel a pride, to value
one’s self as a unique individual.

HAT CAN WE D0 to provide these
W opportunities? Dr. Paul Haun
says, “. . . social planning and personal
concern should abandon the search for
global solutions and invite the elderly
back into the human race.”

The time has come to accept four
basic concepts:
That recreation, along with health, edu-
cation, work, and religion, is one of the
five essentials to every individual’s per-
sonality development and every com-
munity’s social well-being.
That we should start thinking of leisure
as an opportunity, not a problem.
That our present stereotyped concept of
aging and the aged should be updated
and changed.
That social planning should not be frag-
mentized, but should bring together all
of the specialized groups involved in
any phase of the life of the individual.

None of these is easy. Each means a
departure from an accepted, traditional
way of thinking. It is much easier to

240

stay in a rut than to blaze a new trail.
At the last conference of the American
Association of School Administrators,
Dr. Frank Brown of Florida said,
“There are two ways to get to the top
of an oak tree—climb it or sit on an
acorn.” We have been sitting on the
acorn in regard to education for leisure.
Let us start climbing the tree!

By and large, the community recrea-
tion program, which includes both pub-
lic and private agencies, is geared pri-
marily to serving the needs of children
and teenagers. These services need not
be curtailed; indeed, they should be
strengthened, but those education and
recreation agencies that prepare leaders
should pay special attention to training
them for service to the adult, and older
adult, as well as to children.

It is heartening to see the acceptance
of the importance of recreation in re-
tirement villages, high-rise apartments,
mobile home estates, nursing homes and
hospitals, as well as in special commu-
nity programs. It is evidence that the
concept of total planning is bearing
fruit. We need to see people as a whole,
not in isolated groups of preschoolers,
or teenagers, or retired adults. A well-
planned area or facility is one that
serves all these groups. Children need
sunlight in the winter. So do older peo-
ple. Baby carriages are easier to push
up ramps than stairs. So are wheel-
chairs. So are shopping carts. The pro-
vision of halls and doors wide enough
to allow use by someone in a wheel-
chair, or in a long—leg brace, or wheel-
ing a toddler is just as important in a
civic building or a recreation center as
it is in a supermarket. It should not be
necessary to issue a directory of stores,
theaters, and public buildings accessi-
ble to a handicapped person, as several

joined in the celebration by donating
public service time for announcements
about June/National Recreation Month
and by providing news coverage of out-
standing community events.

The Bureau of Recreation of the city
of Knoxville, Tennessee sponsored an
outstanding program for June/National
Recreation Month last year. Under the
guidance of Administrator Maynard
Glenn, the bureau planned a far-reach-
ing program to reach every age group.
Some of its activities included a carni-
val on the Market Mall to acquaint the
business area of the city with all the
facets of recreation for both youth and
adults, the formal opening of a $160,000
senior-citizens center and an $85,000
community center: and a Junior Olym-
pics program.

The Headquarters of the United
States Air Forces in Europe took the kit
prepared by the NRA and developed it
for special use by the armed forces. in-
cluding a suggested base-commander’s
proclamation. Some of the USAF ideas
for activities would serve civilian pro-
grams too; such as, a sports night with
demonstrations in fencing, badminton,
bait casting, table tennis, and body
building; instructional classes in judo,
handball, archery, tennis, and golf;
competitive exhibitions between teams
in soccer, volleyball, tennis, golf, and
swinnning; week-long tournaments;
parades and talent shows; a bicycle
rodeo for maneuvering skills and bi-
cycle. safety; arts‘and-crafts design con-
tests: new hobby classes: father-son
softball games; family bowling leagues;
and a family talent night.

The 1965 celebration should be even
bigger than before. Why not share your
ideas with others? Send a report to the

THEV.I.T.’

EMEMBER the baby boom of
R 1947? How can you forget it as

you look at th 6 2,700,000
seventeen-year-olds We now have among
us and try to meet their recreation
needs? The New York Times reminds
us that these seventeen-year-olds “cut
their baby teeth on television, sharp-
ened their bite on space, grew up to
marry sooner, pay later, become drop-
outs and juvenile delinquents, crowd
the colleges . . . act distressingly com-
placent and painfully idealistic, head
straight for hell and be the bright new
hope of tomorow. . . .
“ . . . Seventeens are fifty-one percent
male, half from middle-income families,
two-thirds living in urban and subur-
ban areas, eighty percent in high school
——seniors, mostly—almost three out of
ten destined not to graduate and almost
half of those who do graduate (forty-
five percent of them girls) college
bound. One out of eight (female) and
one out of fifty (male) are married.”
And our younger teens are also awe-
somely hip.

As you examine your recreation ac-
tivities and service projects for teen-
agers, are they also awesomely hip or
do they stem from the days of the horse
and buggy or even the Charleston and
the Big Apple? Here are some pro-
grams and projects that are attracting
and challenging teenagers across the

country.

ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL

'I‘EENAGERS of Vancouver, Washing-

ton, earned themselves a new
home. Through their own interest and
efforts they played a large part in the

successful passage of a $480,000 bond

242

issue for a new recreation center. The
large area planned for teenagers at the
new center includes an outside entrance
and is accessible to the 80’-by-100’
multi-purpose room. The center offers
teenagers their own club facility where
they can mix with members of the four
local high schools, socialize, dance,
watch TV, read magazines, play Ping-
pong and pool, and discuss, among their
peers, the important issues of the day.

During the bond issue drive the Van-
couver teenagers donned tags saying
“I Can’t Vote But You Can” and dis-
tributed material stressing the impor-
tance of registering to vote. They dis-
tributed question-and-answer material,
spoke to fellow students and parents,
stuffed envelOpes, guarded and trans-
ported architectural models of the rec-
reation building and city hall (all of
their own choosing) after assuring
themselves of the value of both issues.

The teenage Trap Club took the initi-
ative at each step in the bond-issue
campaign to aid in ways brought up by
its own teenage council. The teenagers
took the initiative in the campaign be-
cause they were vitally interested in the
issues before the public. In the state of
Washington, in a special election of
this type, successful passage is based
on getting forty percent of the regis-
tered voters who voted in the last gen-
eral election to vote before the issue is
valid, and a sixty percent yes vote be-
fore the issue is passed. The recreation
building was passed by more than- a
sixty-three percent margin. In view-
ing the potential and value of a formally
organized teenage club, the bond issue
provides a backdrop.

Since 1944, Vancouver teens have
had their own facility, the Trapedero,

they are being exposed to future health
careers. Not only do they learn about
the worthwhile careers Open to them in
medicine and hospital administration,
but they acquire knowledge of sound
health practices to take back to their
homes on the reservations.

Many American Indian boys and
girls are working for their communi-
ties, learning new skills and earning
money for back-to-school expenses at
Save the Children Federation summer
work camps. The federation conducts
these summer camp programs in co-
operation with tribal leaders and the
US. Bureau of Indian Affairs.

0n the Papago reservation near Tuc-
son, Arizona, twenty-two boys worked
on a ranch last summer, learning ranch
management, cattle herd operations,
and soil and moisture control. They re-
paired tribal ranch buildings, corrals
and fences, cleared brush and pasture
land.

This summer, children on the C010-
rado River Reservation in Parker, Ari-

zona, will again pour their youthful
energies into work projects, recreation
activities, and educational field trips.
They will take part in crafts projects
and art classes. In 1964 these young-
sters donated over five thousand hours
of time to improvements on the reserva-
tion, earning their sponsorship aid
through their own efforts. A survey
conducted at the end of the 1964 camp
season showed that about nine-tenths
of the students wanted to enroll in col-
lege after high~school graduation.

While these projects were established
for Indian youth, they are examples
that could apply to any youngster.
Similar projects are now being set up
by the federal government’s anti-poverty
program under a variety of agencies.
Still others could be developed in any
community by public and private agen-
cies, service clubs, and churches.

l

developmental steps follow.

Materials Needed
Vinyl or rubber floor tile (single-

weight). A suggested assortment (of
9”-by-9” colored tiles) is red, yellow,
blue, nfreen, orange, pink. dark blue,
black, white, etcetera.

Scissors ( medium or large) . Small light-
weight tin snips are. also excellent if
available.

Boards for setting and gluing tile. Wall-
board, l'pson board, plywood, or Ma-
sonite are excellent. The size may be
determined by the student, but 8”-h_v-(t”
panels have proved successful.

Clue. Any quick-drying glue that is
waterproof will do the. job.

Plaster of Paris. This powder is used
for filling the spaces between tiles.
Rags. These are. for wiping excess plas-
ter from the tile surface.

Waterproof plaster spray. The spray
gives a high luster to the finished mosaic
and protects the surface.

Procedure
Step I : Developing the idea. To insure.

a successful experience a fully developed
drawing should he prepared by the stu-
dent, then the student can simply trans-
fer this onto lipson board or plywood,

 

 

DIG 

using tracing paper. Direct drawing on
the board is also poSsilale.

Step 2.: Cut the tile into small shapes.
A medium-weight scissors, or light-
weight tin snips. is an excellent cutting
tool. The floor tile comes in tw o weights.
For ease. in cutting, he sure to purchase
the single-weight tile. Also be sure it is
a soft vinyl or rubber tile. not asphalt
tile. Asphalt tile is brittle and easily
breaks or crumbles in the cutting. Quar-
ter-inch squares or rectangles are the
most effective size for an 8"-hy-ti” mo-
saic. Some. students have used various
forms of ameboid shapes- “but remem-
ber, keep them small! If the tile is cut
in large squares the feeling and textural
quality are apt to he lost.

Step 3: Gluing the cut tile on the board.
Setting the tile permanently to the. board
is simpler than setting tile in cement
(grout) . Place some glue on the back
of each tile and press it directly onto the

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

Notes 011 Oldsters

“Senior Citizens Month . . . a time

dedicated to community action on be-
half of older Americans . . . What we

do for them today will enrich the lives
of our children in the decades to come.”
—LYNDON B. JOHNSON, February 16,
1965.

0 Available from the Presidents Coun-
cil on the Aging, Washington, D. C.
20201, is a Projects and Promotion
Guide for Senior Citizens Month. Send
for your copy. Address inquiries to
Fred Panzer, Coordinator.

0 The Los Angeles City Department of
Recreation and Parks is starting a
city-wide senior citizens drama group
which will specialize in light opera.

0 Minnesota is stressing work for its
aging at the local level. Regional co-
ordinators on the staff of the Cover-
nor’s Citizens Council on Aging have
been assigned to work in the regions of
the state where they live, to stimulate
and counsel local leaders and to provide
day-by-day follow through. For details,
get January 1965 issue of Aging, pub-
lished by US. Department of Health,

Education and Welfare, Washington,
D.C.

0 A state jamboree of senior citizens
clubs and organizations was held re-
cently by the New Orleans Recreation
Department. Over three hundred en-
thusiastic seniors attended from all
parts of the state. Steps were taken to
form a state association. Strong pro-
fessional recreation leadership to guide

this embryonic organization was rec-
ommended.

Educate for Leisure
‘61 CONTEND that organized recrea-
tion breeds recreational illiteracy
and dependency. We need to educate
for leisure so that the individual gains
independence in pursuit of his leisure
activities.” S0 said Dr. Betty van der
Smissen, research director of the Na-
tional Recreation Association, to the

1965 Fourth U.S. Army Special Ser-
vices workshop. February 16-18, in San

248

Antonio, Texas. She discussed stan-
dards for evaluating recreation pro-
grams.

“Frequently, we hear that we will be-
gin any program activity IF there is

enough demand,” she said. “I would

cial Service, Fourth Army, and Lou Ham-
ilton, director of the San Antonio Rec-
reation Department, during workshop.

like to suggest that participation is not
a matter of demand, but of motivations.
Changing interest into action means
presenting a program in such a way that
the individual believes in participat-
ing.” She stressed the need for provid-
ing instruction in basic skills in order
to motivate interest in various recrea-
tion activities and to enable the indi-
vidual to be more self-sufficient in his
leisure time. Twenty-nine conferees
from Army installations and units in
the Fourth Army area gathered with
eleven guest speakers for the annual
conference in the Headquarters Fourth

Army Quadrangle, Fort Sam Houston.

Good Teen Club Idea

WHEN A TEENAGER applies for mem-
bership in a Teen Club at Mont-
clair Recreation Center in Oakland,
California, a note immediately goes to
the parent. Signed by the center recre-
ation directors, it invites at least one
parent to attend one of two “Parent
Meetings,” on either a Monday or
Thursday evening, at the center. The
note says in part: “If you cannot attend
either of the Parent Meetings, it will be
necessary to hold your teen’s applica-
tion until the next semester. We feel it
is essential that staff and parents meet
in order to better acquaint you with this
teen club opportunity.

“We feel that teenagers need and are
interested in having full support from
their parents. This lhgeting will give

‘I

I. This program has become an an- ~

lieves will be the nation’s first commer-
cial auto-incinerator—a huge, gas-fired
furnace. Metal parts of junked cars
will be shredded, melted in an adjacent
high-heat furnace, and molded into sim-
ple objects such as grinding rods and
grinding balls, used in the region’s
metal-mining industries. The remain-
der of the car will be fed to the larger
furnace. Both furnaces will operate
continuously and will be able. to swal-
low some fifteen thousand cars weekly,
or seventy-five thousand annually, or so
figures Charles W. Martin who is plan-
ning this undertaking.

According to the Monitor corre-

spondent, the junkyard problem stems
largely from recent changes in the way
steel is made. A decade ago, or less, a
great deal of scrap steel was used in
steel manufacture; and a prime source
of scrap was crushed auto bodies, large-
ly stripped of non-metallic parts. Now-
adays, however, new methods of steel
making, notably the efficient basic
oxygen furnace, demand much purer
raw materials. Scrap material is not
pure enough; and thus our junkyards
increase at alarming rates. Forecasts
of the nation’s economic growth by the
year 2,000, as estimated by Resources
for the Future, figure that in thirty-five
years, yearly auto production will be
twenty-six million. Today, it is less than
eight million.

Free Speech Park

TOP-FLIGHT chess players, a band,
a rope spinner, and a clown took
part in the varied program that marked
the dedication ceremonies for Boston
Park in Los Angeles (on the north side
of the Hollywood Freeway). Designed
as a free speech forum, Boston Park is
located on land leased from the Cal-
ifornia State Division of Highways.
The park has areas on an upper terrace
to accommodate discussion groups.
with benches provided. On a lower ter-
race, there are chairs and tables for
chess and checker players, and the en-
tire park has been suitably landscaped.

0 GENIERATED. You can eliminate ladder climbing and the
carrying of ladder, boxes, and tools by using a Genie, a
self-propelled hydraulic work platform. Steering, elevation,
and braking are controlled by foot pedals conveniently lo-
cated on the floor of the platform, leaving the operator’s
hands free for working up to a height of twenty feet. For-
ward and reverse lever is located on the handrail of the
platform and, for long-distance moving, the Genie is easily
towed behind any passenger car or pickup truck with a tow
bar. A hydraulic outlet for accessories is conveniently lo-
cated on the platform railing. For complete information,

write to Besler Corporation, 4053 Harlan Street, Emery-
ville 8, California.

0 UNDER PRESSURE. Expand your facilities with inflatable
nylon all—purpose marquees, portable shelters, classrooms,
institutional annexes, aircraft hangars, truck fleet garages,
and temporary warehouses. The portable shelters roll up
for easy storage. Their basic structure is a series of flexible
ribs arranged like hoops and inflated to a hundred pounds
per square inch to support a translucent skin of tough nylon
fabric coated with weatherproof synthetic rubber. A pair
of bonnet—shaped end covers are attached to either end of
the building. Since the entire load is sustained by the in-
flated ribs, high pressure is not maintained in the building
itself. Doors can be left open as desired or end walls can be
removed to facilitate traffic circulation at exhibits or enter-
tainments.

To date, three span widths are in production with the
following specifications: span 15 feet, height 8 feet, length
55 feet, weight 300 pounds; span 30 feet, height 16 feet,
length 70 feet, weight 850 pounds; span 60 feet, height 35
feet, length 120 feet, weight 2,800 pounds. The company
hopes eventually to produce buildings of this type with
spans well over 100 feet.

A chief advantage of the buildings is their maneuver-
ability—a 60-footer can be erected in three to four hours
by a team of eight men. The high pressure tubing which
provides the skeleton of the inflatable buildings iS com-
pletely separate from the translucent nylon skin and fits
into pockets equipped with zippers. Normally, the tubing
stays permanently with the rest of the rig, but a tube can
be removed for replacement while the building is still up.

Inflation can be accomplished by a portable compressed
air cylinder, an air compressor, or vehicle sparkplug
adapter. Pressure losses from temperature changes are
small and tubes require topping up only about once a year.

Company, Inc., Belleville, New Jersey, 07109.

the numerous applications of the product for
toys, games, cablnets, signs and displays,
boats, reception rooms, fencing, patios, ca-
banas, tool and equipment sheds, workshops,
utility rooms, et cetera. Some embossed hard-
boards look and feel like burlap or travertine
marble. For your brochure, write to the Ameri-

Phosphatic. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has developed a foamed ceramic
material which effectively insulates enclosed
obiects at temperatures up to three thousand
degrees Fahrenheit. Described in an illustrated
NASA Tech Brief (No. 65-10058), the alumi-
num phosphate mixture provides good thermal
insulation, mechanical support, and vibrational
shielding.

Suggested applications for the new material
include home and factory insulation, building
material, furnace insulation, potting material
fOr electronic modules, steampipe insulation,
fireproof acoustic tile, thermally insulated con-
tainers, and fire-protection barriers.

supported by the research and grants
program of the Vocational Rehabilita-
tion Administration, U.S. Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare.

COP’s purpose was to deveIOp meth-
ods of identifying community resources
for recreation service to the.chronically
ill and disabled and to demonstrate
methods of activating such resources so
that more handicapped persons in this
country can have the benefit of thera-
peutic recreation services.

Some results of the project are:
0 Approximately eight hundred chron-
ically ill and disabled persons have par-
ticipated in COP service demonstrations
in three selected communities.
0 A group of thirty-eight retired per-
sons, who graduated from COP’s pilot
training program at the University of
Scranton, now serve as volunteer rec-
reation-aides in four nursing homes in
Scranton, Pennsylvania.
0 A total of fifty-two teenagers have
been trained to serve some social and
recreation needs of their physically or
mentally handicapped peers in Warren
County, New Jersey.
0 Special programs are now available
to physically and mentally handicapped
children, adolescents, young adults, and
aging persons in these communities.
0 A preliminary exploration of the po-
tential of ultra-high frequency TV as a
medium for extending recreation-re-
habilitation services to the chronically
ill in metropolitan areas was completed
in New York City.
0 A total of seventeen pamphlets,
articles, teaching packets, and other
information materials has been devel-
oped as a result of COP demonstrations.

points, and of deveIOping wider hori-

zons for the cosponsors. At the same

time, it brings new interests and serv-
ices to the community. As the corela-
tionship grows, support for public rec-
reation grows. Lay leaders assist as
standard bearers and ambassadors of
good will. It is an old truism that “a
person who helps you, likes you.” In
the long perspective, our purpose is
achieved, if we, in some manner, have
broadened interests and
made leisure more meaningful to the

recreation

people of the community.

Broader community services through
cosponsorship can develop in many di-
rections. Will the little theater perhaps
cosponsor a summer show, engaging
the talents of teenagers? Will the de-
partment of employment security co-
sonsor a work-recreation project for
youth? Will the art club cosponsor a
free class for underprivileged talented
children? Will the racquet club co-
sponsor a coaching clinic for promising
junior tennis players? Will a women’s
service club cosponsor a week of camp-
ing for the aged, or retarded? Will the
Junior Chamber of Commerce cospon-
sor a Junior Olympics? Will the sym-
phony orchestra cosponsor a free con-
cert for talented school children? If so,
our Trojan Horse is within gates!

THE FINANCIAL REWARDS in cospon-
sorship should be noted. Cospon-
sors share the immediate costs of proj-
ects. Contributing prizes and awards,
assisting with transportation or dona-
tion of material, acting as volunteer
leaders are all budget assists. It is worth
noting also, the cosponsored programs
tend to be basic to the interests of the
people. Successful projects are not
superhcial or superimposed. By its very
nature, cosponsorship taps existing in-
terests and potentials.

Cosponsorship of activities is not a
substitute for trained staff, adequate
facilities, and a good bread-and-butter
daily program. It is no panacea. How-
ever, if we are to serve an important
function in our burgeoning space-age
society, we must tap every resource to
strengthen and broaden our program.

Public recreation must grow with the
times. #

Creative Problem Solving for Executives

W. C. Sutherland

PACK UP your

problems in
y o u r worry bag
and tote them to
Minneapolis for a
two-day institute
on creative prob-
lem solving. T h e
Tenth National Institute for Recreation
and Park Administrators will be held,
October 2-3, 1965, prior to the opening
of the 47th National Recreation Con-
gress. All sessions will be held in the
East Room of the Curtis Hotel, across
the street from the Congress Headquar-
ters.

The Institute will deal with the sub-
ject, “Creative Problem Solving.” This
is a practical, “action-oriented, how-to-
do-it” course, with executives learning
the methods by taking problems
through the complete “problem-solving
cycle,” with the aid of a workbook con-
taining the formulas. Problems are not
solved permanently without sound de-
cisions, which is a fact increasingly
important in today’s world. The secrets
and methods of creating ideas, decision
making, and how to find better solu-
tions to problems will be fully explored
and revealed to the delegates.

The creative education movement is
cited as one of the most recent signifi-
cant developments in education. The
movement has been spearheaded by the
Creative Education Foundation, Inc.,
and its founder, Dr. Alex F. Osborn of
the well-known advertising firm of Bat-
ten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn. The
State University of New York at Buf-
falo, in cooperation with the Creative
Education Foundation, holds its 11th
Annual Creative Problem Solving In-
stitute in June. Over two thousand dele-
gates from leading business and indus-
trial concerns have attended these insti-
tutes, together with leaders in educa-
tion, military, and government agencies.

workers and their wives, over

communities. Programs in these
i start with simple activities like
fg cards, watching TV, and then
to hobbies, educational and cul-
ctivities, counseling on personal

problems, interpersonal relationships,
discussion groups, et cetera. These cen-
ters in many cases represent cooperative
community effort. For example, a drop-
in center in \Vaterbury, Connecticut, is
housed in a school building and staffed
by leaders from the park and recreation
department.

Education for leisure is not bound by
age. It can continue throughout life as
these previous examples show. For
those who have not had opportunities

for leisure in their earlier years, such
education can be focused upon prepara-
tion [or retirement. Here is a relatively
new field, in which a few programs have
been conducted under a number of dif-
ferent sponsorships. It has tremendous
potentials which have not yet been ex-
plored. It can be as simple or as elab-
orate a program as the local situation
demands. And it can be adapted to the
degree of education for leisure that each
participant most needs. #

ing and Christmas are some of the
special programs the band has done.

As it was suggested that the band
wear some type of uniform, the ladies
made their own aprons and hats. The
aprons have a large pocket shaped like
an oak leaf (the county park system
emblem). Hats were made from paper
plates, egg cartons, pie pans, with
novelty gadgets, spatulas, funnels, cake
slicers, measuring spoons, et cetera—
very imaginative masterpieces.

The ladies eagerly look forward to
each week’s rehearsals, and spend much
time planning future programs. The
band has received many invitations
from organizations in the community,
and has happily filled some of these
engagements. Appearing before groups
in nursing homes is another service.

The band has contributed much to
the senior-center program. It has given
many an opportunity to participate ac-
tively, and to be creative, besides being
a very satisfying experience to the

WHAT GIVE S?

W110 GOES all over New Orleans?
Who bowls, dances, has carnival
balls, luncheons, and parties? The
Jefferson Parish Golden Agers, that’s
who! Under the supervision of Mrs.
John Marquez, the senior citizens of
the parish have really been on the move
in programs offered by Jefferson Par-
ish Recreation Department.

Bowling and putt-putt seem to be

the favorite sports of the golden-agers,
for just about every week they visit
bowling alleys and putt-putt courses.
However, the main athletic event of
1964- was an Olympic meet. Metairie
Playground was the scene of the event
as the golden-agers competed in such
things as the shot-put—throwing of
balloons painted black—and weight-
lifting -—— determining which person
weighed the most.

Other events the senior citizens en-
joyed in 1964 were tours of a wax
museum, a visit to an ice show, ceramic
show, the Keesler Air Force Base, and
a bayou tour on the Mark Twain.

Three times during the year the
golden-agers appeared on day-time TV
programs, and for an entire day Jeffer-
son Downs Race Track was host to
senior citizens, even offering them a
special handicap. To add to their al-
ready busy social schedule, the golden-
agers had several parties and lunch-
eons, such as seafood suppers and a
Christmas luncheon.

Variety is the spice of life and the
golden-agers proved it by having an
all-day party at the Falstaff Brewery at
the beginning of July, closing the
month with a watermelon party. They
thoroughly enjoy all that they do—
especially making trips. Last year
thirty-nine members really enjoyed a
six-day, five-night trip to the Great
Smoky Mountains.

Even the golden-agers, themselves,
are surprised that they can do so many
things so late in life. One of the best
things that ever happened to them was”
to join the Jefferson Parish Golden
Agers Club—DAVID SCHEUERMANN, Di-
rector of Recreation, Jefferson Parish,

‘Voluntarism’ in Retirement
Continued from Page 219

M

person moving from the one who isserved to the one who
does the serving. Their talents, skills, and certainly many
hours of their free time are being put to excellent volun-
tary use. More leisure time may become a problem for
some, but it has definitely Opened golden opportunities for
many others. The challenge for voluntary service is being
met and accepted by more and more retirees. With plenty
of time—indeed, a new freedom—and with a variety of
skills ranging from the stuffing of envelopes to the execu-
tive ability of a retired chairman of the board of a multi-
million dollar corporation, from a pleasant receptionist who
always had trouble adding a two-digit column of figures to
a retired comptroller of a successful auditing firm, from a
“whittler” to a skilled cabinet worker, from a gossipy sec-
retary to a retired public-relations executive—from this
kaleidosc0pe of occupations come a host of retirees adding
new dimensions to voluntarism.

On one of the pages of the Rochester Directory for Senior
Citizens there is this attention-getting caption:

“Help Wanted—Male and Female. Terrific
Retirement Benefits! Older People Specially

Needed.”

This is followed by this explanatory paragraph: “There
is a very Special employment agency in Rochester that’s
looking for older people with time and inclination for com-
munity service. There is one little catch. There is no pay-
check at the end of the week . . . except the feeling that you
have used some of your extra time doing something impor-
tant for someone else, and that some task even more useful
is waiting for you next week.” Through the programs at
a center the individual has the opportunity to combine his
efforts with those of others so that a synergistic effect is
deveIOped.

That word synergism, a term that is more familiar to
chemists, describes what happens when you combine a num-
ber of elements whose interaction produces something quite
different from the mere sum of all its parts. It is like adding
two and two to get a sum, not of four, but of five, six, or
seven. While a chain is no stronger than its weakest link,
it is also true that there are things you can do with a chain
that you could never accomplish with a truckload of separ-
ate links not joined together. That’s synergism. The same
thing De Tocqueville had in mind when he commented on
the mutual assistance he observed in our country, that makes
us no longer “isolated men.”

In addition to the willingness of the individual to volun-
teer his service, the agency must be able to attract and re-
tain the interest of its citizen volunteers. Health and welfare
agencies, both public and private, must regard volunteers
not as watered-down professionals or as necessary evils that
have to be given token endurance, but as people who have
something specific to add that we cannot get from anyone
else no matter how much we pay them. With this goes a
careful and discriminating selection and utilization of vol-
unteers for their special abilities and preferences. This is

where we make or break c1tizen interest and invol

The challenge in utilizing the special skills of 01
unteers is in picking the right man or the right wo
those important spots where we need strong lay leadll
or where we need enveIOpe stuffing. Earl Lippincott, 
tor of the National Budget Consultation Committerll.
has very forcibly enunciated the importance and n
of marshaling our volunteer leadership lest it wit
disappear, said recently. “This greatest gift (vb I
service) of our greatest leadership requires a corre
ing capacity to receive it.”

The professionals must realize that laymen can co
new values and judgments which, not infrequently, l
professional attitudes and stimulate the professio
greater achievements. Of course, there is also an
priate use of the “service” volunteer who may requir
guidance and supervision—lay people who are ha}
willing to fill the gaps that our limited supply of profe
staff cannot be stretched to cover. Once, however, a
has volunteered for a task, the program can best reta
when the volunteer is convinced that the iob is neces
that he is making a real contribution; in short, when
an enriched inner personal feeling that he has b

service. I

We tend to think of volunteer service as somethinL
does for an agency, usually a specific job or memb
on a committee or board. However, the volunteer
other value that must not be overlooked. He has a
to see the problems and limitations of the agency fr
“inside,” he becomes more keenly aware of What
causing adverse criticism in the community, and
interpret such situations with greater knowledge an
viction to the community and to the agency. Vol
have been referred to as public-relations ambassadors
are, indeed, not only as interpreters, but also as co
reminders of a simple truth that an agency belongs
itself but to the whole community. i}:

o The term “voluntarism” as used by Mr. Meyer se
be a generally accepted term in social work and
circles. There is, on the other hand, "voluntaryism,"
is used by the National Health Council “790 Broa
New York 10019) in a new pamphlet, Voluntaryi
Health. The council describes this term as meaning
porting or doing anything by voluntary action"-—th
“voluntary” being used in its sense of “free” action
pamphlet goes on to state, “Freedom of the indi
freedom of association, freedom of enterprise are
roots of voluntaryism in a democratic society. One
deepest meanings of voluntaryism is perhaps be
pressed in terms of its significance to the individu
[who] persists in his desire to . . . make some contri
to society." ‘

R. Roy Rusk, new associate executive director
National Recreation Association, in charge of workin
volunteers, on the other hand, refers to this participa
the same kind of service, as "volunteership" (see
212), while some recreation leaders have been using
unteerism." As for Mr. Webster, he lists “volunta
“voluntaryism,” and even carries the word on into ”

’t'aryist" for the individual.-——Ed.

is in a home furnishings fabric
department. Cotton drapery
material lends itself well to
this craft since it has an inter-
esting texture and will “give”
when stuffed. It also offers the
widest range of rich colors and
‘. For the traditionalist, there are scenic prints like
dma Moses or a Currier and Ives design. For the
n art enthusiast, Picasso designs are now available in
)me decorator cottons.
lecting the fabric, look for a material with a design
nough to be cut for quilting without overlapping the

Two other techniques can
be used to create a slightly dif-
ferent art form. One is a col-
lage effect, made by combining
designs from several prints in-
to one interesting picture. For
example, cut out animals, flow-
ers. or a landscape scene from
different fabrics. A r r a n g e
these cutouts in an artistic col-
lage on a background fabric

DON’T have to be a genius with a paintbrush to create

POMPS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

A NEW COLORED TISSUE, especially designed to simplify,
speed up, and eliminate waste in the decoration of par-
ade floats and displays, parties, proms, and similar activi-
ties, is called Pomps.
It represents an entire-
ly new concept in the
marketing of colored tis-
sue for nearly all decora-
tive purposes. Pomps
come in packages of
three hundred 6”-by-6”
sheets of a single color,
. and are available in sev-
enteen colors. When used to decorate one-inch chicken
wire as the supporting structure in making a float, each pack-
age of Pomps will cover a total of four square feet if you in-
sert one tissue in every other hole. For denser coverage, one
tissue per hole, one package will cover two square feet of
wire. For further information write to Donald A. Grenley,
Crystal Tissue Company, Middletown, Ohio.

BATIK-PRINTING

TRY THE ancient craft of batik-printing with your groups.
This method of putting designs on fabrics, using wax
and dye, is an ideal craft for all ages, but we feel it might
have special significance for the older adult. All you need
is a piece of fabric, home dyes‘, paraffin, and a brush.

Batik designs are made by brushing melted paraffin or
wax on portions of the fabric and dipping it into dye. The
dye colors only the unwaxed areas. After the fabric dries
apply wax to the dyed portion. Dip the fabric into a second
dye. Repeat the process for each color in the design. The
intricate, marbleized effect, typical of batik prints, is cre-
ated when the wax cracks and dyes seep in.

Choose a cotton fabric like batiste or muslin as they pro-
duce the most effective batiks because they absorb and re-
tain dyes best. Start with a simple design, making a sketch
using simple lines and just three colors. Your group can
move on to more complex compositions later.

PROCEDURE:

° Sketch design on paper the same size as fabric.

0 Trace design on fabric, stretch fabric taut on wax paper,
weighing down the corners.

' Melt paraffin in double boiler and apply with brush to
areas not to be dyed. Wax must penetrate fabric thoroughly.
( The heated wax must be handled with great care.)

0 Dissolve one package of low-heat home dye in two quarts
of lukewarm water. Use enamel pan.

0 Dip fabric in the dye for twenty minutes. Rinse thorough-
ly and dry.

° Remove wax by placing dry batik between layers of paper
toweling. lron, using medium heat. Toweling absorbs wax.
9 Repeat waxing and dyeing process for each color in the
design, beginning with light colors and progressing to dark-
er ones. Each new dye will take over the previous one. Go
from the primary colors to secondary colors in the process.
Blue dyed over yellow produces green, blue over red pro-
duces violet, and red over yellow makes orange. The com-
bination of all three primary colors gives brown. (All areas
covered with wax throughout. the processes will remain
white.) To add depth to designs and get more of a “crackled”
effect, roll fabric and gently twist after wax has set, causing
the wax to crack and let in small amounts of dye.

Attach completed batiks to wooden dowels for wall hang-

 

ings, frame them, or use for scarves. dresses, or skirts.

' Hit dye works well.

NEW PUBLICATIONS

NEW DIMENSIONS IN
THEATERS

Theater technology is opening new
doors and breaking through barriers to
give us flexible theaters, auditoriums
and arenas to serve the needs and de—
mands of modern drama. Whether the
new theater is on Broadway, off-Broad-
way, on a college campus, or in a high-
way shopping center, its shape and au—
dience—stage relationship is dictated by
its specified function (See also Page
229). The following books are reviewed
by Siebolt F rieswyk, National Recrea-
tion Association Consultant on the Per-
forming Arts.

Theatres and Auditoriums (second
edition), Harold Burris-Meyer and Ed-

ward C. Cole. Reinhold Publishing
Corporation, 430 Park Avenue, New
York 10022. Pp. 376, illustrated.
$20.00.

In: FIRST EDITION of Theatres and

Auditoriums was published in
1949, and it has been recognized as the
standard authority in this field. How-
ever, the spectacular upsurge of con-
struction of theaters and auditoriums
recently, the creation of new materials,
equipment, theater techniques and de-
signs since 1949 fully justified a revi-
sion of the first edition.

Messrs. Burris-Meyer and Cole have
succeeded handsomely in presenting
the many exciting and daring innova—
tions which have taken place during
the intervening years. The second edi-
tion not only brings concepts up to
date, it also supplies a lavish and ex-
pertly selected collection of photos and
diagrams to illustrate the new concepts.
Every possible item of theater construc-
tion, equipment and operation is pre-
sented with clarity, thoroughness, and
éclat. It is a splendid book for techni-
cians and the public interested in get-
ting a real sense of the dynamics of
modern theater and auditorium prac-
tices.

The Ideal Theater: Eight Concepts.

ber House lnc., 55 West 13th Street,

clude a theater using new film pro-

with adjustable stage levels, an open-
stage theater, adaptable theater for col—
lege and university drama use, an ur-
ban theater center complex, an intimate
music-drama theater, and comparative
studies of vision and acoustics in pros-
cenium and other theater types. These
design projects originated under the
Ford Foundation Programs in Human-
ities and the Arts, W. McNeil Lowry,
director. Participants and contributors
to the projects include the names of
some of the most famous contemporary
figures in theater and theater architec-
ture. The projects were exhibited na-
tionally in 1962, and a smaller version
will be circulated for exhibition until
September 1965.

Futuristic designs explored in these
projects serve the same purpose as
those done in the fields of automotive,
aero-Space, and other fields of creative
design. They open the doors to the
new era of technology and art. The
price bears little relation to the content
or the quality of this publication. It
will be a prized possession among those
who are especially interested in pro-
jecting themselves into the theater of
tomorrow—in thought if not in actu-
ality.

A New Theatre. Tyrone Guthrie.
McGraw-Hill, 330 West 42nd Street,
New York 10036. Pp. 188, illustrated.
$5.00.

YRONE Guthrie tells us in A New

Theatre how his dreams for a rep-
ertory theater came true in Minneapo-
lis. Their realization in the beautiful
theater bearing his name is a moving
story of inspired leadership and com-
munity support. ( Delegates to the 47th
Recreation Congress must be sure to
see this.) Mr. Guthrie tells why he
built his theater, and this brings forth
an orchestral tutti of criticism of Broad-
way. Right or wrong, the trumpets of
condemnation blare forth from the
pages of A New Theatre. He also turns
the horns of criticism upon community
theater, and it should be said that this
sounds pretty sour.

His comments on acting and direct-
ing reflect his experiences in directing
opera performances as well as plays.
Like Toscanini, Mr. Guthrie knows how
to make an instrument speak. Perform-
ers and playgoers will gain a great deal
of insight into the art of dramatic per-
formances from this section of the book.

“Daddy, you forgot...ev 1qu lb hurts!”

It happens in the best of families! Dad takes
the kids out fishing and forgets that every
litter bit hurts . . . in more ways than one!
I Floating litter is a safety hazard. Litter
causes pollution of waterways. Litter causes
good fishing spots to be closed down . . .
spoils the natural beauty of America's parks
and recreation areas. And that’s not the

 

worst of it! I The good citizenship

you want your children to have go
board when they see you toss litter .
So, Dad, Mom, everybody—lead th
to the litterbag. Carry one in your

"and car. On camping trips, take Iitt

‘ with you. Make it a family project tg
America Beautiful!
