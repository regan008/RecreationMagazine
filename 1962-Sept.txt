The Final Step
Sirs:

Your concern for the integration of
handicapped children into programs for
the nonhandicapped is most encourag-
iug. . . . For several years, I was asso-
ciated with the Easter Seal Society
and Cerebral Palsy Association during
which time our primary interest was in
developing a total and strict recreation
program that would culminate in the
integration of our patients.

We came to realize rather quickly
that there was a significant distance be-
tween the indiscriminate casting of a
llandicappcd child into a group of
healthy youngsters, and preparing this
same child, who has been virtually iso-
lated socially, for integration with chil-
dren of his age and maturation level.
To successfully integrate a handicapped
child into a “normal” recreation setup
with the nonhandicapped requires a
structured and gradual sequence of pro-
grams, whereby the disabled youngster
can prepare and be ready for the final
and essential step. We learned rather
painfully that, unless this process was
practiced, many youngsters were sub-
ject to unnecessary and cruel failure.

I am not inferring that failure is com-
mon when the two groups are inte-
grated, but I do wish to stress that in-
dividual readiness and preparation must
be of prime concern or the experiment
will be fruitless and a lasting adjust-

ment into society may never be realized.
In our three years of day camping and

swimming programs for physically
handicapped children in Natick, many
buddy days, family nights, and other in-
tegrated special events have been con-
ducted. These activities have helped
bridge the gap from segregated play to
total integration into society. Buddy
days have afforded an opportunity to
observe a child’s capabilities in playing
and working with physically normal
children in his age group. As a result,
many disabled children have “gradu-
ated,” so to speak, from our programs
and are now participating totally in
regular Little League, Scouts, recrea-
tion basketball, etcetera with their non-
handicapped friends.

Does it not stand to reason then that
a well-developed year around program
for physically handicapped children is
certainly as important to this group as
similar sustaining programs are to so-
called normal children, youth, adults,
and senior citizens? lsn’t successful in-
tegration the product of what went be-
fore . . . ? Preparation is the key to
successful integration. It is in this area
of preparation that we are falling short,
since most communities have a variety
of programs geared to the nonhandi-
capped, which the disabled child can
attend when ready.

hCREATION is recreation no matter what or where the
R setting may be. This I believe. Recreation is refresh-

ment, recreation is play, recreation is diversion. We inherit
our word from the Latin, recreare, to create anew, to refresh.
In our own language, to recreate is an act of refreshment
of the strength and spirit after toil.

Recreation involves people, it involves activities, it in-
volves attitudes. It involves these three ingredients in a
period of time known as leisure—free time—uncommitted
time from any task or responsibility. The time off the job,
the time free from household chores, the time free from
prescribed medical treatment.

Recreation is a part of the life of every individual, that
part of life in which an individual is free to choose what he
wants to do. He may follow his own interests and inclina-
tions without the restriction of regulations or schedules. He
may choose positively or he may choose negatively. And
herein lies the challenge to leadership in the field of recrea-
tion: to promote, encourage, and inspire the positive de-
velopment of recreation in leisure; to enable the individual
to live a richer life through opportunities to broaden rec-
reation interests and to develop latent talents. This is the
reSponsibility the professional recreator accepts when he
enters this field.

Recreation is not an end-all or a cure-all. It is a part,
an essential part, of life, and takes its place with other es-
sentials—work, religion, education, welfare, and health—
in contributing to the positive deve10pment of the individual
in our contemporary life. Recreation does not replace the
need for food and shelter. It cannot replace the satisfaction
of accomplishment through work. It does not replace a
medical prescription. It does provide a balance, serving as
a complementary force in any of these situations.

Recreation, in the fullness of its meaning, must not he
limited to an activity concept. Activities are tools, the means
through which essential satisfactions are accomplished or
enhanced. Security, recognition, acceptance, creativity, ad-
venture, a sense of accomplishment, and group associations
are basic needs of individuals that can be realized through
recreative experience.

Values and byproducts inherent in recreation are many.
They blend in a harmonious pattern to achieve the oy and
satisfaction of the experience. Recreation may be thera-
peutic; it may include educational values not in the con-

scious awareness of the individual. It encourages and fos-
ters an appreciation of the arts, of music, of the bcauty of

the world in which we live. It contributes to physical, men-
tal, and emotional fitness and stability.

Recreation can be the key that unlocks the door to self-
discovery, to respect for self, to the joy of sharing mutual
interests and experiences with others. It can also be the key
that opens the door to respect for the worth and dignity of
others. Recreation crosses barriers of language and cultural
differences. It is not confined by space or locality. Recrea-
tion is universal.

The broad concept of the fundamental meaning of recrea-
tion makes interpretation difficult. There is a tendency to
confuse methods with concepts. There is still, in our culture,
a i‘eluctance to recognize dignity in the words “play,” “fun,”
and “relaxation.” Recreation is confused with idleness and
wasted time. Such an interpretation leads to frustration on
the part of those who are charged with the responsihility of
a recreation program. It forces the professional recreator
to seek justification for recreation on the basis of accom-
plishment of other goals: keeping children off lllC streets or
curbing juvenile delinquency.

My philosophy of recreation does not confine it to any
setting or situation. Methods may vary, ohjcctives may as-
sume different emphasis, but the principles and general con-
cepts remain the same. Recreation is important in the life
of any individual, whether sick or well, able-hodicd or
handicapped. It may assume greater importance in thc life
of the individual who is confined or limited in movement
because of illness or disability.

Medical practice has long recognized that the opportunity
to function as normally as possible during hospitalization
contributes to the well-being of patients during convales-
cence. This has an important bearing on recovery. Rec-
reation as part of normal living, thereforc. can be a con-
tributing factor to the recovery of the patient. Relief from
boredom and release of tension may replace the depression
and defeatism that accompany illnesses in some people.
Creative opportunities may encourage a healthy, construc-
tive attitude toward life, especially in cascs of illness from
which permanent handicaps may result.

A constructive attitude toward life is important to each
individual, and recreation can contribute to such an atti-
tude. Eduard Lindeman said many years ago, “Recreation
is not a set or series of exercises, it is rather an attitude, a
gallant attitude toward life.” If each person in the field of
recreation attained this attitude in the full sense of its mean-
ing and assisted others to incorporate such an attitude in
their personal lives, the contrihution to life in our world
today would be immeasurable. Herein lies the challenge of
recreation. if:

’63“ Q...

) DIMMED IIOPE. Senator Harrison A.
Williams, Jr., of New Jersey has de-
nounced the House ApprOpriations
Committee for tarnishing the “bright
hope for an effective open space pro-
gram for the urban area.” Discussing
the open space program, Senator Wil-
liams said that in a last-minute maneu-
ver in the closing hours of the session
last year, the House effectively cut the
350,000,000 program to $35,000,000.
“Now the House Committee has refused
to allow the unexpended balance of the
$35,000,000 to remain available until
expended. Instead, about $31,000,000
of appropriated funds will revert to the
Treasury, because the Housing Agency
has only made commitments of about
$4,000,000 to date.”

The open space program provides
grants to cover twenty percent and in
some cases thirty percent of the cost ac-
quiring and preserving open space land
in and around urban areas which have
recreation, conservation, scenic or his-
toric value. The purpose of the pro-
gram is also to help curb urban sprawl
and promote better patterns of urban
development.

Senator Williams said the fact that
the agency has made commitments Of
only $4,000,000 “is in no way indicative
Of the tremendous need for this pro-
gram and the prospects for giving as-
sistance in the coming year.” The House
denial of the $31,000,000 unexpended
appropriation “is, in effect, penalizing
the Housing Agency for the care it took
in making sure that the program started
off on a sound and proper basis.”

The New Jersey Democrat pointed
out that the law carries extensive com-
prehensive planning requirements which
take time to fulfill. “In addition, a new
program providing entirely new con-
cepts and posing entirely new problems
takes time to implement,” he states. He
urges that the committee restore the un-
expended balance from last year, and
cited the growing activity of the states
as an indication of the potential use of
the program. New Jersey, New York,
and Wisconsin have all passed major
open space programs, and several other
states are developing similar ones.

) NATIONAL PARK STUDY. The National
Academy of Sciences will study the fea-
sibility of an expanded natural history
research program under an agrecment

with the National Park Service. It will

SEPTEMBER, 1962

 AS WE GO TO PRESS

be the academy’s job to set forth find-
ings and recommendations for a re-
search program designed to provide the
data required for effective management,
develOpment, protection, and interpre-
tation of the national parks; and to en-
courage the greater use of the national
parks by scientists for basic research.
After the completion of the study and
evaluation, recommendations will be
given to Secretary of the Interior Stew-

art L. Udall.

} MEMORIAL GROVE. The Montana Wild-
life Federation and the Idaho Wildlife
Federation will dedicate a memorial
cedar grove honoring Bernard DeVoto,
conservationist and historian of the
West, on September 9. The grove is lo-
cated on the Lochsa River in the Clear-
water National Forest of northern Ida-
ho, about forty miles southwest of Mis-
soula, Montana. DeVoto visited this
beautiful river valley many times and,
in accordance with his request, his ashes
were scattered over the area. Within
the grove, a bronze plaque commemo-
rating DeVoto’s many contributions to
the cause of conservation will be placed
on a large boulder.

) 50TH BIRTHDAY FILM. The 1962 Girl
Scout Senior Roundup at Button Bay
State Park on Lake Champlain, Ver-
mont, a major event of the organiza-
tion’s Fiftietll Anniversary celebration
which brought togethcr ten thousand
teenage girls and adult leaders, was
filmed for an hour-long telecast to be
given over a nationwide network on
September 24 from 9-10PM.

The program will be produced by
General Foods Corporation in coopera-
tion with Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and
presented on CBS-TV stations. Follow-
ing the television broadcast, General
Foods will prescnt color prints of the
film to the Girl Scouts for local show-
ings in communities across the country.

) ROWING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. The
United States along with fourteen other
countries will participate in the first
Rowing World Championship to be held
in Lucerne, Switzcrland, September 6-9.
The Lucerne Regatta Organization,
sponsoring the event, expects a total of
thirty countries in the competition.

MANAGING RECREATION RESOURCES

The following resolution was adopted by the Governors’ Conference at
its fifty-fourth annual meeting in Hershey, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1962:

WHEREAS recreation is a human need contributing to human happiness,
essential to the well-being of people, and is a legitimate continuing govern-
mental responsibility directly associated with the public welfare; and

WHEREAS more recreation facilities and services are needed today than
ever before due to the continued growth and urbanization of the population,
the increase in amount of leisure time, improved transportation, higher
standards of living and longer life expectancy; and

WHEREAS the recent report of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review
Commission ( see RECREATION, M arch and April 1962) estimates that by the
year 2000 the national population will double while the demand for recrea-
tion opportunities should triple; that nine-tenths of all Americans eighteen
years and older engage in some outdoor recreation activity in the course
of a year; and that participation in outdoor recreation during each summer
may be expccted to incrcase from the present 4,400,000,000 separate out-
door recreation activity occasions to 6,900,000,000 activity occasions by
1976—an increase Of 184 percent over participation in 1960;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Governors’ Conference urge
each state to prepare a long~range plan for the development of outdoor rec-
reation opportunities and that each state take the lead in working with local
government toward a balanced state-local outdoor recreation program.

Biscayne Bay threatens the marine life
and recreation use of that picturesque
estuary. Pollution from the refinery
could destroy the delicate ecological bal-
ancc existing in this extremely impor.
tant fish-producing and scenic area.
Only strong protests by local conserva-
tion groups and marine biologists early
this year have temporarily blocked con-
struction. As a further result, an inten-
sive study has been authorized by the
Dade County MetrOpolitan Commission
to develop regulations for control of air
and water pollution from industrial
wastes. According to County Manager
Irving McNayr, experts will be called
in from the University of Florida, state,
federal and local health departments,
and the Florida Department of Conser-
vation.

D A STATE’S RESOURCES. The represent-
ative work of thirty-seven New Hamp-
shire artists, some of them nationally
known, is on exhibition until October
14 on the grounds of the Wentworth-
Coolidge Mansion in Portsmouth. A
pioneer program arranged to establish
a relationship between the state’s natu-
ral resources and contemporary art, the
exhibit, including sculpture, is spon-
sored by the New Hampshire Division
of Parks (formerly the State Recreation

Division) as a public service. It origi-
nated after discussion between Russell
B. Tobey, state director of parks, and
members of the board of directors of the
New Hampshire Art Association.

D BOND ISSUE. Omaha, Nebraska, has
passed a $1,000,000 bond issue for park
and recreation facilities by a vote Of
27,606 to 19,169. The issue was pro-
moted by a committee of volunteers
headed by a group of young men, many
of whom have families who will benefit
from these facilities. This committee
had less than $2,000 to work with, and
over two hundred appearances were
made before all kinds of groups and or-
ganizations to tell the story. All of this
happened within a period of approxi-
mately three months. The committee
followed an outline prepared by the Na-
tional Recreation Association.

D LEADERS IN FITNESS. Representatives
of local Boys’ Clubs enjoyed a four-day
indoctrination in physical fitness at
Camp Graylag in Pittslield, New Hamp-
shire this summer. The program was
sponsored by H. P. Hood 81 Sons, Bos-
ton dairy firm. The boys, selected by
their individual Boys’ Club on the basis
of physical-fitness tests and their leader-
ship ability, enjoyed all the fun of camp
life during their four-day stay, includ-

Philadelphia’s amazing

  . . . recreation development

 

I,   L:

Harvey Pollack
YOU ain’t seen
nothing yet
until you’ve seen
Philadelphia’s rec-
reation setup. Dele-
gates to the 1956
National Recrea-
tion Congress in
the City of Brotherly Love were quite
impressed with what was going on.
What was then a program gathering
momentum is now roaring along on
all cylinders as Philadelphia completes
ten years of progress. The last six years
have proven just as outstanding as the
first four, and visitors to the 1962

Congress will see some exciting devel-
opments.

 

At last count there were better than
350 different facilities under the juris-
diction of the department of recreation
headed hy Commissioner Robert W.
Crawford. These sites range from tot-
lots and wildlife preserves to an over-
night camp and a boat launching area.

Lee Center is a neighborhood oasis for both young and old.

 

facilities in 1952 would find it dillicult
to believe that he was in the same city
today. There has been an amazing
transformation as the city vaulted from
one of the most backward areas to be-
come one of the most progressive.

In 1952, most playgrounds consisted
of a field with a fence around it and
some unimaginative equipment. Today,
a playground is packed with equipment
that delights the youngstcrs, enables
them to use thcir imagination, and con-
sequently has increascd thcir visits. In
the old days, the recreation system was
aimed almost exclusively at providing
active play for boys and young men,
ignoring other age groups and girls and
women. Today, the department stresses
family recreation and provides facili-
ties for all age groups as sites are built
or redeveloped.

Philadelphia is meeting the specifica-
tions and the modern concept of what
facilities a playground should have. ln
many cases, old, inadequate, unsanitary
structures have been torn down and re-
placed by modern buildings. In some
centers, small buildings with meeting
rooms have been erected to supplement
structures that existed previously.

 

Venice Island Playground exemplifies the city’s new areas.

Improvements includc the paving of
areas for court games such as basket-
ball and volleyball and for free play
when inclement weather prevents the
use of turf fields; construction of ap-
paratus areas for preschool and ele-
mentary-school age children; and the
installation of irrigation for fields and
treatment of soil to provide usable turf.
Also, suitable systcnls of connecting
paths and landscaping have bccn pro-
vided to improve the appearance of the
playgrounds and make thcm an asset
to the neighborhood.

In the ten-year stretch from 1952,
101 different playgrounds or recreation
centers and parks have been dedicated
after being built or redevelopcd. Thirty-
eight other sites were improved but
were not dedicated, making a total of
139 different projects in this stretch at
a cost close to 520000.000.

Since 1952 the city has acquired and
devcloped four new recreation centcrs
and redeveloped twcnty-two others out
of the current total of thirty-four. 0f
the total of eighty-one playgrounds,
thirteen are new and fifty-three have
been redeveloped. Most of the othcr
fifteen are scheduled for redevelop-

RECREATION

pent. Thirteen parks have been reha-
.Iilitated to include play equipment.
Fhree other parks have been built and
Ieventeen old parks were rehabilitated.
I' here are many more new playgrounds
and centers currently either in the con-
struction or planning stages.

In the swimming pool category, six
new ones have been constructed and
five others have been rehabilitated.
Other improvements are planned to the
thirty-two others under the depart-
rnent’s urisdiction. The swimming sea-
son has been extended to start at Me-
rnorial Day and to continue to Labor
Day. Family swimming also is now
available at the new or redeve10ped
pools. More than two million annually
use the pools. Two ice rinks have been
constructed, the first pair in the depart-
ment’s history, and more are on the
way. Approximately a dozen sites have
been acquired for redevelopment even-
tually as recreation facilities.

The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve at the
southwest tip of the city was acquired
in 1957 and serves as one of the few in
America within a city limits. The for-
mer Pennsylvania State Fish Hatchery
was acquired in 1956 and is utilized for
fishing for youngsters and for picnick-
ing. In addition, a modern boat ramp

was erected in 1961.
The Philadelphia Stadium has under-

gone extensive improvements and annu-
ally plays host to events that draw
approximately three hundred thousand
people (Army-Navy foothall, Liberty
Bowl, Acme Bowl, etcetera) . Camp Wil-
liam Penn in the Poconos was acquired
to provide an overnight camp for needy
youngsters. The Chamounix and Happy
Days day camp were rehabilitated, as

was the famed Robin Hood Dell.

In addition to physical improve-
ments, there also has been instituted a
comprehensive and coordinated pro-
gram of recreation services which has
vaulted participation at the centers
from 9,994,000 in- 1952 to 25,000,000
today. This figure does not include the
wide use made by citizens at parks,
picnic areas, Philadelphia Stadium, and
Tinicum Wildlife Preserve, as well as
such well-known events as the Mum-
mers Parade, the summer band concerts
of the string bands on a center city
plaza and hand concerts at the centers
by police and firemen’s group.

SEPTEMBER, 1962

SOME of the program “firsts” since
1952 include citywide hasketball
and softball tournaments; indoor ten-
nis; city chess, foul shooting and soccer
tourneys; picnic services to organiza-
tions and churches; water carnivals;
camping at Camp William Penn; arti-
ficial ice skating; dance festivals and
youth pentathlons; citizen recreation
councils at each facility; a Festival of
Youth and a Recreation Exposition;
traveling dramatic players in the sum-
mer plus puppetry; creativc dramatics
and theater-in-the-round; nine ceramics
and pottery centers; and a baseball
program under a central Junior Base-
ball Federation. This list could be ex-
tended many times if the numerous
programs and events that are conducted
in the eight recreation districts and by
individuals centers and playgrounds
were included.

The program has been extended to
all ages, both male and female; to the
handicapped; to older people and to
the hard-to-reach individuals. It has
been extended to neighborhoods that
lack recreation facilities through the
use of forty-one public schools and
twenty-one housing recreation facili-
ties. The program was broadened from
a mere playground and athletic pro-
gram to include a wide range of cul-
tural, intellectual, social, and outdoor

recreation.

THE MAINTENANCE DIVISION keeps up
with the tremendous expansion of
the recreation sites and facilities by
providing daily, routine and emergency
services for the program division. The
maintenance section maintains and in-
stalls a wooden indoor track at Con-
vention Hall for the famed Inquirer
meet and also for the department’s own
meet; it installs and operates indoor
tennis courts and also assists in many
other activities within the department.

The planning division follows Com—
missioner Crawford’s mandate that no
two playgrounds in the city should be
alike. He insists on individuality at
each site, and the architects delight in
improvising new types of equipment
and buildings. A novel cone-shaped
building in the western part of the city
contrasts with a colorful rectangular-
shaped one in the northeast.

The imaginative equipment includes

play apparatus shaped like dragons,
trains, boats, firc engines, whales, por-
poises, lurtles, girafles. caterpillars, bee-
hivcs, lighthouses, etcetera. Climbers
may be scaffolds, tepees, ladders, bal-
ance beams, space ships, rocket ships,
tightropes, etcetera. A variety of swings
includes tot, hohby horse, tandem,
bucket, and belt. Sliding boards also
come in various types such as spiral
slide, chutc slides, trail blazer slides,
double slide, half-arc slides, etcetcra.

IIE OUTDOOR FACILITIES offer many

features. Tennis courts, deck shuf-
fle courts, horseshoe pits, bocce courts,
quoit areas, badminton courts, and vol-
leyball courts are plentiful. Outdoor
basketball, a year-round activity, is
available at most centers. In addition
to erecting full-length courts, Commis-
sioner Crawford also has pioneered the
half-court style to accommodate more
participants.

Naturally, there are softball, base-
hall, soccer, football, and Little League
fields in abundance. Lights to lengthen
the play day are provided in a good
portion of the areas. In the play-
grounds, the buildings conIprise areas
for arts and crafts, drama, meeting
rooms, games, etcetera. All have kitchen
units that enable refreshments to be
prepared on the spot. The recreation
center buildings have larger quarters
and house gyms and auditoriums.

The recreation department works
with many different ‘civic groups in
running activities such as Yo-yo tour-
neys, marbles championships, festivals,
safety bicycle rodeos, tennis instruc-
tion, track meets, and so on. It also
issues permits and provides for instruc-
tions for play streets (the blocking of
small streets as play areas from 10AM.
to 4PM) and issues permits for the
attachment of street showers to fire
plugs.

Recreation in Philadelphia has come
a long way in ten years. Yet Bob Craw-
ford visualizes advances in the coming
years that will surpass the progress
made thus far. If you’re one of those
“I’m from Missouri” types, your visit
to the Congress should make you sing
a new tune. One look at the vast system
and the imaginative equipment should
be enough. Philadelphia has climbed
to the forefront of the nation’s recrea-
tion parade and intends to stay. #-

Her wide experience in leadership in community recrea-
tion programs—in recreation centers, camps, and on play-
grounds———as well as in leadership training eventually proved
to be an open sesame to foreign travel and Helen has acted
as a special recreation consultant at air bases in many differ-
ent countries during recent years while on loan to the Air
Force. She has been a moving force in developing the base-
community concept of recreation in the Air Force and in
developing leadership for the AF youth program. She also
has visited all the fifty United States, except North Dakota,
and her suitcase has been her home all these years.

Helen Dauncey is a graduate of the Boston School of
Physical Education and her formal education included a
BS. in Education from Boston University. She also has had
teaching experience in public and private schools, colleges
and the YWCA.

Her earlier experience as a teacher, coupled with a sound
philosophy of recreation. have been basic ingredients in the
successful training of recreation leaders. She has been de-
manding of the best. both from herself and from those she
taught. Her great zeal and devotion always have been fla-
vored with a pleasing sense of humor. Men and women in

countless numbers throughout the country are serving the
recreation movement with greater professional competence
and dedication as a result of Helen Dauncey’s years of faith-
ful work.—C. E. REED, Director Emeritus of the National

RECREATION

Physical
Fitness
and

Community Recreation

A Pattern for Action.

Charles B. “Bud” Wilkinson

ESS THAN A CENTURY aco, the aver-
L age employed man was expected to
work around twelve hours a day, six
days a week, and it was frowned upon
if his “leisure time” was not spent pro-
ductively. There was no problem about
leisure time for the ladies and the self-
employed. They had too little to give it
much thought.

Recreation in those days was often in the form of a Sat-
urday night tafiy pull, or for the more adventurous, a neigh-
borhood squaredance. People had very little time for other
types of recreation, yet they were for the most part, physi-
cally fit. They were fit because they had to be in order to
meet the demands of everyday living.

With the turn of the century came the rapid advance of

 

automation and consequently a steady increase in the
amount of leisure time for Americans of all ages. Physical
fitness has just as steadily decreased. Since it is no longer
necessary for the average individual to exert physical energy
to earn a living, the citizens of our country have become
soft. The lack of physical fitness begins with the very young
child who rides to school instead of walking, progresses
through the teenager who prefers television to physical ac-
tivity, and continues through every age group, through all
walks of life.

Considering that the strength of our nation is dependent

 

MR. WILKINSON, director of athletics at the University of
Oklahoma since 1947, is special consultant to President

Kennedy on youth fitness.

SEPTEMBER, 1962

 

upon the vigor and fitness of all our people, it is most un-
fortunate that physical fitness continues to decline despite
our unparalleled high standard of living and the great ad-
vancement of medical science toward increased longcvity.
We must combat this serious problem with every force we
can muster. The most logical method seems to be through
the concerted efforts of schools and every agency providing
leisure-time recreation programs and services.

Last year, soon after Prcsident Kennedy‘s inauguration,
the President‘s Council on Youth Fitness, with the aid and
endorsement of nineteen key educational and medical or-
ganizations, began work on a specific physical fitness
program for our nation’s school children. The completed
suggested program was bound into a 112-page illustrated
booklet. In late summer of 1961, 250,000 copies of the book
were mailed to state departments of education for distribu-

tion to schools through state directors of health, physical
education, and recreation.

Surveys show that half the nation’s elementary and high
schools are using the suggested program as a bcginning
guide. Thousands of children have been tested in pilot proj-
ect cities scattered throughout the country. Results of these
tests prove conclusivcly that a simple, school-centered pro-

gram noticeably improves the physical fitness of students
within a few short months.

Greatly encouraged by the results of the recommended
school program, the council has now prepared and placed
in the hands of schools and recreation departments across
the nation a suggested community recreation program.
Much of the material contained in the program grew from
discussions among recreation and physical education leaders
at the recreation conference held in Washington, D.C. on
February 21, 1962. The community recreation program is
centered around four basic recommendations. They are:

1. Establish a community-wide physical-fitness commit-
tee involving all recreation and other leisure-time agencies.

2. Provide state and local laws, wherever necessary, to
broaden the use of existing playgrounds. schools, and all
types of facilities suitable for recreation activities.

3. Provide year-round as well as summer opportunities
for special physical-fitness centers and sports clubs.

4. Provide and expand opportunities for daily vigorous
physical activities for all age groups and in all programs
wherever possible and appropriate.

1t is impossible to over-emphasize the need for full co-
operation of all recreation agencies within the community.
The suggested recreation program can never attain a high
degree of effectiveness without it. For this reason, it is
urged that the local governing body join with the school
board in establishing a community physical-fitness commit-
tee, appointing as chairman an aggressive, hard-working
individual. either lay or professional, who will be a real
crusader for a cause he deems worthwhile.

The remainder of the community physical-‘fitness com-
mittee would have representation from all community or-
ganizations concerned with recreation, either directly or
indirectly. The committee would work together in a unified
efiort to coordinate the planning and execution of a recrea-

343

F':’f cooperation of all community agencies is needed

i‘.- 1}; 1 f fun flit-h would assure maximum benefit to the
c- .. mm. as a. whole.

19 duties . f the community physical-fitness committee
wwud include the evaluation of the effectiveness of existing
programs for improving physical fitness, determining if ex-
isting programs meet the physical-fitness needs of all age
groups, the identification of undesirable overlapping of fit-
ness programs and other wasteful duplication of effort, and
the securing of maximum use of all facilities in the commu-
nity, including evening and weekend use. It would also be
appropriate for the committee to coordinate action for plan-
ning and financing new physical recreation facilities. L

Regardless of how comprehensive the council’s re om-
mended program may be, regardless of the unlimited co-
operation of community recreational groups and leaders,
no public program of recreation will be successful unless
it is accepted and [wgnted by the citizens concerned.) There-
]fore, it should also be the function of the commumty com-
mittee to provide the kind of publicity that will obtain pub-
Iic acceptance of the program and establish the desire for

physical fitness. \

America has been musclc hound from holding

a steering wheel. The only callous placc on an

American is lhc bottom of his driving toe.

—Will Rogers.

 

It will be necessary to secure the cooperation of local
newspapers and radio and television stations. Often, the aid
of local advertising agencies may be enlisted as a public
service on a “no charge” basis. A good, sound campaign
should be launched which will convince citizens of their
need for physical fitness and the henefits they will dcrive
from being fit; inform them of the existence of the commu-
nity physical-fitness program; and provide activities which
will motivate them to join the program, individually and as
family groups.

A community-coordinated physical-fitness program re-
quires carefully planned, vigorous activities. It must he kept
in mind, however, that these activities must be cnjoyahle,
or participants will not remain in the program. Opportuni-
ties should be provided for beginners to master the basic
skills of various activities.

It has been found that instructional groups are often more
successful when divided into age groupings. 'Adults tend to
become self-conscious when attempting to learn new skills
in the presence of much younger people.

Since there is usually a rapid decline in adult physical
fitness after the age of twenty-six, it is urged that both men
and women secure a complete physical examination from the
family physician before entering a program of vigorous ac-
tivity. Then, with his approval, participation should begin
in moderation. The council’s suggested community program
includes tests for adult fitness, exercises and scoring charts.

344

Sports and exercise equipment is suggested for the family’s

use at home.
One of the most important aspects of community recrea-

tion programs is the strengthening of family ties; and, of
course, the importance of parental example in setting a
physical-fitness pattern cannot be over-emphasized. Public
and voluntary recreation agencies must reach the parents
if they are to reach the children. Therefore, every commu-
nity recreation program should include activities suitable
for family participation.

Swimming is an ideal conditioning activity for everyone
and is particularly well suited to participation by family
groups. Roller skating, popular with all age groups, is
greeted with enthusiasni by families in search of recreation.
School gymnasiums and multipurpose rooms may double as
skating rinks, using skates with plastic wheels to keep floor
marring at a minimum. Multiple use of facilities wherever
possible represents good community economy and is strongly
recommended.

Bicycling is a highly enjoyable and inexpensive means
of recreation and exercise for family groups, especially
those representing wide age ranges. Walking, too, is an ex-
cellent form of exercise adaptable to the entire family. Hikes
may bc related to history, folklore, religion, nature study—-
whatever the countryside has to offer.

These activities are only a very small portion of a long
list that might include motorboating, fishing, camping, danc-
ing, even mountain climbing. In short, any sport or pas-
time promoting vigorous physical activity should he con-
sidered. A varied recreation program will assure something
to attract everyone in the community.

It is important that the community rccreation committec
not omit special-interest sports. Public and voluntary rec-
reation agencies should encourage and sponsor special in-
tercst sports clubs. This hait will snarc many an otherwise
uninterestcd individual. Those skilled in various sports will
not miss the opportunity to participate and compcte. ln-
structivc programs within the clubs will serve as an incen-
tive to those who have not yet become proficient or who are
eager, yet rank beginners. Increased intercst and enthusi-
asm will be gencrated if cooperation is requested from the
United States Olympic Development Committee in the in-
itial stages of club developmcnt.

Many years as a football coach have taught me that it is
the teamwork that wins the game. So I would like to urge
that once community fitness committces are appointed, they
get together as a team and carefully evaluate existing rec-
reation programs making certain activities are scheduled
that develop vigorous physical health. I suggest that they
forget past differences. if any, and work together with one
goal in common—complete physical fitness for everyone in
their community.

Only with the whole-hearted cooperation of school and
community recreation and physical-cducation leaders will
we be able to instigate programs which will recapture the
physical fitness that should be the birthright of every

American. #

How schools and recreation departments are supplementing each other’s efforts

ITNESS PROGRAMS in schools and
F recreation departments or other
community groups can be programed
to supplement and enr'ch each other. In
this way, young peoplexegiven a con-
stant basis for fitness in the schools and
an active attitude towards fitness and
recreation which can carry over into
adult life.

In Fort Pierce, Florida, Woodrow
Dukes, recreation director for St. Lucie
County; the school faculty; and the
principal at Fairlawn Elementary
School decided to organize a fitness
program. The school does not have a

physical education instructor, so Gabe
Prescott, Mr. Duke’s assistant, and Ron
Tietgen, a recreation intern, were as-
signed to the program. All grades were
given simple calisthenics and group

games. In the upper grades touch foot-
ball, basketball and softball were

taught. Ten minutes of the physical
education period were devoted to calis-
thenics including pushups, knee bends,
butterfly, etcetera. After calisthenics,

-part of the group used the chinning

bars, others climbed ropes. Track events,
such as dashes, broad jumps, and pole
vaults, have recently been included.

The Tulsa, Oklahoma, recreation de-
partment feels that there should be a
continuation of fitness programs during
the summer months, and decided to
conduct a two-month trial fitness pro-
gram during the summer of 1961. The
recreation staff met to determine the
sort of program that would be most
beneficial, the age group that would be
most interested, and the means avail-
able for promoting such a program.
Realizing that a hard-core type of fit-
ness program would not appeal to those
who need it most, the department de-
signed a program which combined rig-

 

orons excrm rs and competitive sports
mitt social .t".'i\ltl(:~- such as parties,
bionic. trips, and inld hikes. It was
rcn. 1r ually .aphasized that lack of per-
sonal physit al ability is not a handicap,
that thr 1. ll-ri important thing is indi-
vidual improvement. A local radio sta-
tion and the local newspapers agreed to
carry regular advertisements urging
junior -high-school youngsters to be-
come members of the fitness clubs. The
theme used was “Improve your Physi-
cal Fitness through Recreation. Join
your Community Center’s Physical F it-
ness Club.” Over five hundred young-
sters met the first day at eight different
recreation centers in the city. Each was
tested in six different track and field
events, the results to be used as a stand-
ard to gauge improvement. A day’s ses-
sion consisted of thirty minutes of ex-
ercises followed by the formation of
different teams to play competitive
sports. The last regular session con-
sisted of retesting the participants in
the same track and field events. Ap-

spend a week outdoors living physical
fitness as well as academic fitness. Two
instructors take the children to an out-
door school; they live in tents, eat out-
of-doors, and have exercise as well as
study hours. They study science, as-
tronomy, meteorology, conservation;
they hike through miles of wooded area

WE WHO WORK

of housing and
community facili-

more demand for
assistance in devel-
0ping the recrea-
tion potentialities of projects and com-
munities. The Community Facilities
Administration, one of the five constitu-
ents of the United States Housing and

responsibility for four major programs:
college housing loans, senior citizens
housing loans, public facilities loans.

ticularly significant in generating new
public recreation projects. Under this
program, money is advanced to a com-
munity to plan a public facility, and
the funds are repaid when construction
of the projects starts. Many communi-
ties and public agencies do not have
the necessary specialized staff to draw
up plans for projects. Often they find
they cannot even start to look for con-
struction money until their plans are
ready to present to the public and to

prospective lenders. Our agency ad-
vances funds for preliminary or final
planning, including investigations and
surveys needed as a basis for decisions
about the type, size, and scope of the
project, estimates of costs, and so forth.

Among the recreation facilities for
which CFA has made these planning
advances have been public libraries,
swimming pools, a municipal theater,
civic auditoriums, community parks,
a cultural center, recreation facilities
included in water and hydro-electric
development projects, a sports arena,
and a public golf course. Some of these
are small projects, [or which only small
advances are needed: $1,800 to plan
a $138,000 park or 31.500 to plan a
$103,000 project consisting of two
swinnning pools. Larger projects for

which CFA has advanced planning
funds have heen an $18.000,000 cul-

tural center (’CFA lent $190,000 for its

planning) and a $60,000,000 river

of these loans have been for water,
sewer, and gas distribution facilities in
communities under three thousand pop-
ulation. More and more, we find that
such facilities are the necessary under-
girding for the‘promotion Of tourism
and other recreation activity. This is
particularly true of communities whose
economic develOpment is being stimu-
lated through assistance under the Area
Redeve10pment Act. In their search for
new industry, many of these communi-
ties are beginning tO develOp their
tourist possibilities.

Thus, a town near Glacier National
Park, Montana, which had fallen on
hard times because a railroad had re-
duced its operations, is returning to
economic good health by improving its
facilities as a year-round resort. CFA
is helping this town by lending it funds
tO modernize its old wooden water line.
Similarly, it recently lent funds for
water, sewerage, and street improve-
ments to a Utah city which is turning
its former silver-mining Operations into
a tourist attraction.

PROBABLY the most famous program
in the CF A is college housing, now
approaching the $3,000,000,000 level.
Loans under this program are available
not only for housing for students and
faculty, but for dining halls and college
unions which are usually the social cen-
ters of campus activities. In the new
and exPanding colleges which have
been generated by the enormous growth
in enrollments since World War II,
recreation facilities are usually de-
signed directly into the buildings,
whether they are residence halls, dining
balls, or college unions. Lounges, study
rooms, snack bars, banquet and ball-
rooms, gamerooms are typical features;
terraces, sun decks, patios, sculpture
courts, domed dining rooms and circu-

lar music rooms not only signify a more
sophisticated architectural era, but an
awareness that Jack cannot be a dull
boy in this complicated moment in
history.

HE NEWEST PROGRAM in the Com-
munity Facilities Administration
-——-0ne which I find most appealing——
is the senior citizens housing loan pro-
gram. In the past few years, it has
dawned with a great light upon many
Americans that our marvelous increas-
ing life span is not only an Opportunity
but also a frightening challenge. Most
of us will spend a substantial number
of years in retirement, a period Of life
when income maintenance, health care,
and housing are particularly critical
needs.

With the senior citizens housing loan
program, the Housing and Home F i-
nance Agency is seeking toprovide new
solutions to the housing needs Of the
elderly. The agency is not in the busi-
ness of lending funds for “old folks’
homes” or nursing homes; it is in the
business . of making long-term, low-
interest loans for projects especially de-
signed to meet the requirements of
Older people.

These requirements relate not only
to the fact that people in their sixties
and beyond may have some physical
limitations, but that for many people
housing at this stage Of life comes close
to being a universe. SO it must pro-
vide more than shelter. lt must, for
many peOple, provide the opportunities
which will help them find a purpose in
life. And this is where recreation be-
comes a matter of first, not secondary,
importance.

The elderly are like everyone else
in respect tO the need for a purpose in
life. Indeed, they may be more in need
Of purpose, since they have more time
available and less routine activitity to
use up that time. The activities which
kept them occupied for thirty or forty
years—earning a living, rearing a fam-
ily, running a household, participating
in community work-—-have largely come
to a halt. Now they are faced with

 

the stark problem of how to make each
day meaningful.

Every group which undertakes to
sponsor a senior citizens’ housing pro-
ject should recognize this problem as
one of the key questions to be answered
in planning the design and facilities of
the project. Of course, CFA does not
require provision Of specific recreation
facilities for each individual occupant
Of a project, but we will scrutinize ev-
ery application closely to be sure that
the fullest possible opportunity for rec-
reation is at hand.

And by recreation for senior citizens,
I do not mean worthless busy-work. To
expect any adult, whether he is twenty-
seven or seventy-seven, to take pride
and find fulfillment in an activity
pitched at the intellectual level of a
first-grader is patently ridiculous. Yet
many organizations think that shuiile-
board courts, checker sets, and classes
in elementary basket-weaving are all
that is needed for satisfactory recrea-
tion activity for senior citizens.

Organizations which have had the
good sense to promote activities which
reach thc very highest levels of intel-
tectual or cultural activity have been
astonished and overjoyed by the re-
sponse. Recreation directors for many
golden-age groups are frequently heard
to complain these days that they can-
not keep up with their members’ fan-
tastic variety of interests. They have
learned firsthand what many specialists
in the field of geriatrics have recently
been telling us: that old age does not
have to be the closing stage Of life.
Many people can have, in retirement, a
flowering more brilliant than anything
that has gone before. But first, the
seed must be carefully nourished and
cultivated, and few ingredients will be
more important than the proper op-
portunities for enriching recreation ac-
tivity.

SO, in Community Facilities Admin-
istration, we have the Opportunity tO
assist in fulfillment Of needs for public
facilities, including the need for rec-
reation throughout the full and excit-
ing chronology Of life. #

IF THE GOOD LIFE of the future is not to degenerate into a vast traHic jam and a strangled com-
plex of cities, there is urgent need for immediate urban, regional, statewide, and nationwide
master planning—VICTOR GRUEN, architect and city pianner.

Open space is at a premium indeed in cities like Pittsburgh.

IN METROPOLITAN AREAS

Part 1

George D. Butler

ECREATION is arousing serious concern in metropolitan
R areas where population is zooming and open space is
rapidly diminishing. Consideration of procedures to assure
adequate provision of recreation in such areas is of prime
importance. The situation calls for an evaluation of the
methods by which responsibility for providing recreation
services in metropolitan areas can best be allocated among
various levels of government and a redefinition of the roles
of all levels of government engaged in providing recreation
for metropolitan residents.

In trying to deal with this problem, one must consider
the type of recreation service demanded by residents of
metropolitan areas and provided by agencies serving them.
Many areas include one or more cities with a comprehensive
system of recreation areas and facilities and a variety of
specialized recreation services. Some of these serve and
benefit many nonresidents. In other metropolitan areas,
local recreation facilities and services are limited and in-
adequate to serve the day-to-day needs of the people.

Another problem concerns administration. Should the
entire recreation function be administered by a single
agency? Would it be better to assign subfunctions, such as
certain types of properties, facilities, and services to differ-
ent agencies at different levels of government?

The Metropolitan Area—The standard metropolitan sta-
tistical area, as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Budget
and followed by the Bureau of the Census, “is a county or
group of contiguous counties which contain at least one city
of fifty thousand inhabitants or more, or ‘twin cities’ with
a combined population of at least fifty thousand. In addi-
tion to the county or counties containing such a city or cit-
ies, contiguous counties are included in a standard metro-
politan statistical area, if, according to certain criteria, they

are essentially metropolitan in character and are socially
and economically integrated with the central city.” A num-

lion’s research department.

SEPTEMBER, 1962

“Consideration of procedures is of prime importance”

ber of additional criteria outline in greater detail the con-
ditions under which a contiguous county may be included
in the metropolitan area.

In 1960 there were 212 metropolitan areas located in
forty-six states and the District of Columbia. Of these areas
133 comprise a single county; the others include from two
to eight counties, and twenty-six of them are composed of
counties in more than one state. A large percentage of the
areas—175—have only one central city.

The total population of the 212 metropolitan areas in
1960 was 112,900,000 pe0ple, or nearly two-thirds of the
total U.S. population. Ten areas had a population of two
million or more; twenty-two had less than one hundred
thousand each. Between 1950 and 1960 their p0pulation
increased 26.4 per cent, and this increase represented 84
percent of the nation’s total growth during the decade. Two-
thirds of the increase in their pOpulation occurred outside
the central cities.

Conditioning Factors—A number of conditions prevail-
ing in metropolitan areas must be taken into account in
considering methods of providing recreation for their resi-
dents. A few of them are:

0 The complexity of government within these areas, as in-
dicated by the fact that they include some 16,976 local
governments.

o Widely different state governmental and statutory restric-
tions on the powers of area residents to set up administra-
tive procedures for handling the recreation function.

I The disparity between tax and recreation boundaries of
the areas.

0 The multiplicity of jurisdictions providing recreation
service to residents of metropolitan areas. These include
federal, state, county, municipal, special district and school
authorities, all of which are supported through taxes by area
residents.

o The widespread lack of a systematic coordinated pro-
gram for acquiring needed recreation land or for providing

nrrJ-d r’ r'ition services because of overlapping boun-

1' I . ' dictions within the area.

Stdil- ll) 11H

0 The general lack of an effective means for arriving at a
consensus in relation to policy questions, even though
formal and informal c00perative arrangements exist be-
tween agencies providing recreation in some areas.

0 The competition and rivalry between units of govern-
ment which are potential sources of conflict; elsewhere the
indifference as to recreation deficiencies.

o The wide diversity in the legislation in the various states
authorizing counties to acquire and operate recreation areas
and provide recreation programs, to perform such services
jointly with other units of government or to accept such re-
sponsibilities by transfer from municipalities within the
county. All states do not have laws permitting the creation
of recreation and/'or park districts or of inter-county
authorities.

The Recreation Function—What is the nature of the
recreation function as related to the metropolitan area?”
One aspect is concerned with providing a well-rounded sys-
tem of park and recreation properties designed to serve the
various recreation interests of the people. These include
neighborhood parks and playgrounds, community parks
and playfields, large recreation parks; special recreation
areas, such as stadium sites, golf courses, swimming centers
and camps; parkways; large reservations; and sites for
museums, zoological gardens, aboreta, etcetera. Responsi-
bilities of authorities that control these properties include
their acquisition, design, construction, operation, mainte-
nance, and use.

The organization and conduct of a diversified program
of indoor and outdoor activities at the public recreation
areas and other properties made available for public use is
a function that requires trained, qualified leaders. This in-
cludes sponsorship and guidance of recreation groups and
associations providing recreation activities and services for
special groups. such as the ill and handicapped; furnishing
advice and information on recreation areas, facilities and
activities; and the loan of recreation equipment to indivi-
duals and agencies planning recreation programs.

Another aspect of service provided by recreation authori-
ties involves the organization and conduct of training pro-
grams, in some cases in cooperation with other public and
private agencies. These take such forms as training insti-
tutes for playground or indoor center leaders, for officials

* Some of the ideas and proposals for allocating responsibility in
providing recreation to residents of metropolitan areas have been
taken from two publications dealing with the subject:

Governmental Structure, Organization, and Planning in Metropoli-
tan Areas—Suggested Action by Local, State, and National Govern-
ments, hy the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
(July 1961). Available from Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington 25, D.C. $.30.

ganization. Issued by the Bureau of Governmental Research, Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles (June 1961) .

in such sports as basketball or softball, or for volunteer
leaders in churches, clubs, or other organizations. Clinics
are conducted to provide instruction for individuals in such
activities as golf, boating, skiing, and bait casting. Recrea-
tion authorities take the lead in forming recreation councils
and committees to further e00perative planning, promotion,
and action by public and private agencies providing recrea-
tion service in the area.

Several tests have been proposed for determining the ne-
cessity for a reallocation of responsibility for recreation
activities among the several levels of government perform-
ing services for residents of metropolitan areas. One test
centers around the question whether or not the provision of
recreation services requires the use of scarce resources not
being provided in an optimum manner. It would determine
if there is a lack of intergovernmental c00peration in the ac-
quisition and planning of recreation sites and in the organ-
ization and conduct of programs, which reduces the value
of every recreation expenditure.

A second test explores the existence of tax inequities. Are
people living in the unincorporated areas consumers of rec-
reation services which are being subsidized by residents of
nearby incorporated localities? Does the central city pro-
vide regional type facilities which are used equally by resi-
dents of the remainder of the area? Since the large-city
taxpayers usually bear the total expense, an alternate ad-
ministrative method migh prove more valid and satisfac-
tory. Unless it can be shown that the present division of
responsibility makes possible a reasonably adequate system
of recreation areas and facilities and a well balanced recrea-
tion program for all the people of the area, financed on an
equitable basis, the need for a change is indicated.

In case the tests indicate the desirability of allocating
recreation subfunetions at different levels, certain criteria
may be used as guidelines. For example, there should be
a relationship between the allocation of costs and the recipi-
ents of the benefit from the service provided. Account
should therefore be taken of the geographical distribution
of cost and benefits. if a particular service benefits only the
residents of a given governmental unit, responsibility for
providing it should rest with that unit, whether it be town.
city, or county. The fiscal capacity of various units to per-
form recreation subfunctions must he taken into account.
For example, small municipalities can support neighbor-
hood playgrounds but cannot be expected to operate a zoo-
logical park or a regulation golfcourse.

A proposed change should he designed to achieve a de-
gree of economy. Certain aspects of recreation service, such
as the operation of an expensive facility or the employment
of a specialist, may entail unit costs that make them un-
economical in a small governmental unit, whereas these are
reasonable in a larger jurisdiction. The willingness of the
various government units in a metrOpolitan area to accept
and carry out responsibility for recreation services must
also be taken into account. 0n the basis of past performance
or speculation, judgements as to the responsiveness of au-
thorities to the will of the people will influence the alloca-
tion of such responsibility.

The ability of the various units to administer recreation

RECREATION

subfunctions is of primary importance. It involves such
factors as their legal authority, financial capacity, the quali-
fications of their staff, and availability of needed facilities
and equipment.

Other aspects of the recreation function merit considera-
tion before reviewing available alternatives for the alloca-
tion of responsibility for recreation at various levels of
government. One of these relates to recreation areas and
facilities—their acquisition, design, construction, operation,
maintenance, and use. EXperience has indicated that these
procedures are so closely inter-related that for any type of
area, whether playlot or large recreation park, they can
normally be administered most effectively at the same level
of government. In some cases, however, properties acquired
by one agency may advantageously be transferred by lease
or other agreement to an agency on another level better
qualified to operate and maintain them.

The fact that several branches of the Federal and state
governments control and Operate extensive pr0pertiessuch
as parks, forests, reservoir sites, and wildlife preserves that
provide recreation opportunities for residents of metropoli-
tan areas must be taken into account. Admittedly, a large
percentage of the recreation service now available to metro-
politan areas is furnished by county, regional, municipal,
and school authorities. However, because some Federal and
state recreation properties serve primarily the residents of
a single metropolitan area, the agencies responsible for them

must be considered in dealing with this problem.

TEENA GE R 0 UND UP

CITY IN MINIATURE. Many towns
in the United States have discovered
ways of channeling teenage energies
into productive and creative enterprises.
They have learned, too, that teenagers,
with their enormous capacity for work
and play, welcome opportunities to be
of service in the community.

“Project ’61,” undertaken by teen-
age youth of South San Francisco, Cal-
ifornia, recently unveiled the Hi-Teen
Center to the public at a cost to tax-
payers of less than fifty dollars. Some
months ago, the basement area of the
main recreation center was reserved for
teenagers’ leisure-time activities. The
area needed a bit of sparkle so the Hi-
Teen Council organized redecoration
with the theme of “San Francisco in
Miniature.”

Armed with paint and brushes, and
the enthusiasm and imagination that
only teenagers can muster, they worked
until the area took on the glamour and
early color of a miniature San Fran-
cisco. The old walls were decked out
with sketches of famous San Francisco
landmarks—cable car, ferry building,
opera house, Seal Rocks, bay bridge,
Fisherman’s Wharf, expresso shop, and
a typical Gay 90’s restaurant. The proj-
ect was open to all teen members. Over
one hundred participated under the di-
rection of the recreation staff. When
completed, the appearance of the center
provided a stunning contrast to its
former drabness.

This was only the beginning of the
efforts of the Hi-Teens and the city to
create a project that would make the
community proud. A miniature of the
Golden Gate Bridge was to be given
away by a national airline to the organ-
ization that could best explain why they
wanted it. It was a twenty-four-foot
replica of the famous San Francisco
structure, ten feet tall at the towers and
wide enough for walking.

A concerted puhlicity campaign was
put on hy the teenage club and city staff
to win the bridge for the center. The

352

judges were Hooded with telegrams, pe-
titions, proclamations, and endorse-
ments from the city council and cham-
ber of commerce. A giant scroll with all
teen members’ names inscribed thereon
was also presented. The campaign paid
off, and the city won the contest over a
thousand other entries. Today the
bridge is installed, in all its glory, in the
teen drop-in center.

The whole teen project, as described
above, has won the admiration of many
other communities and organizations in
the area. Such efforts on the part of
teenagers in the community point up
the fact that, more often than not, they
are interested in assisting in community
projects and that, given pr0per guid-
ance and recognition, will contribute
enthusiasm and constructive ideas.

TEEN TOILERS. If you have a chore
to be done in Manor, Pennsylvania,
there are close to two hundred “Teen-
Toilers” you can call on. This service
is only one of the many good deeds per-
formed by a group of youngsters called
the “Teentown of Manor,” organized to
help teenage youngsters channel their
energies productively. Recognized as
the only teenage club of its type in the
state, this is an organization of which
Manor and the entire western Pennsyl-
vania area can he justly proud.

Teentown held its first meeting on
March 1, 1955, with 109 teenagers in
attendance. Adult advisors, chosen
from among the parents, had visited
many teenage groups during the ten
months previous to the first meeting and
gathered information that was used in
setting up the group. Many organiza-
tions donated financial help so that
Teentown could get under way. Today,
Teentown no longer depends on dona-
tions. The youngsters have earned more
than $5,000 themselves, and have he-
come financially independent. There
never has been any charge to members
for joining, nor have there been any
dues collected from the group.

Members raise their funds by spon-
soring record-hOps and selling home
products door-to-door. The money helps
to pay for activities which the group
sponsors, such as hobby classes, charm
schools, target shooting, and sports in-
struction classes.

Membership is open to all teenagers
from thirteen to nineteen years of age.
After nineteen, members become alum-
ni. The Manor Board of Education has
granted the use of the junior high school
building for club meetings held twice
monthly except during the summer
months. Special meetings during these
months are arranged by the advisors.
Members must attend three out of four
meetings to remain in good standing,
unless excused by reasons acceptable to
the advisors.

With guidance from a staff of nine-
teen adult advisors—and a long wait-
ing list of other parents who want to
help—the youngsters do everything for
themselves. Members must earn points
to retain their membership. These are
awarded for cleaning up after weekly
dances in the American chion Home;
helping in community projects; good
behavior at home, school, church, or on
the street; working 011 fund-raising
sales. A melnher may lose points for
questionahle hehavior, cursing, and not
attending church. lt is not considered
“snitching” to report another member’s
breaking of the rules. Seventy-five
points entitle a member to a monthly
trip with a group to Pitt foothall games,
plays, a tour of New York City, resort
areas, museums, or college campuses
throughout the East.

Teentowners have two spiritual ad-
visors, the Reverend Richard Rapp of
the Manor United Presbyterian Church,
and the Reverend Father Leonard San-
esi, of the Irwin Immaculate Conception
Roman Catholic Church. They have ar-

THE BRUNSWICK STEW. In Bur-
lington, North Carolina, the Teen Age
Club is sponsored by the city recreation
department and guided by a council
composed of twenty high-school stu-
dents. Council members are chosen by
former members on the basis of leader-
ship, scholastic ratings, character, and
ability to get along with others. Busi-
ness and discipline of the teen club are
handled by the council. The group, a
lively and enthusiastic one, decided last
year to raise money for an addition to
the teen center. The Brunswick Stew
which followed had council members
doing KP with fifty pounds of onions
and two hundred pounds of potatoes.
The bluejean brigade delivered the or-
ders of stewin person to acquaint towns-
people with the club and its members.
The job completed, the council pre-
sented the money they had earned to
the city council with the request that
an addition he made to the activity
room. The enthusiasm caught and plans
were made for the addition. The club
built up its treasury again and bought
shoes for the youngest eighteen chil-
dren at the Christian Home for Chil-
dren, bubbling over with self-satisfac-
tion at the sight of the young children’s
happiness. During Thanksgiving, the
teens bought turkeys and carried food-
baskets to three families and during
Christmas prepared boxes and toys for
needy groups. In January the group
conducted the Teen March of Dimes
in Burlington. Citizenry and the rec-
reation department point with pride to
these youngsters.

MAKING IDLE TIME CONSTRUC-
TIVE. If the example of the Teen-Age
Club of the Anaheim, California, Park
and Recreation Dcpartmcnt could be
regarded as any indication of future
leaders, this city should havc some
outstanding citizens within the next
decade. To the seventeen hundred
youngsters who make up the club, the
organization has becomc a symbol of
“leadership” and “cooperation” for the
community.

The club is made up of seventh-,
eighth- and ninth-grade students in the
Anaheim district. Over fifteen percent
of the district’s junior high students
are registered with the activity.

The primary aim at this time, accord-
ing to Superintendent of Recreation
Lloyd Trapp, was to “keep the young
men and women off the streets and
make their idle time constructive rather
than destructive.” The job for getting
the club “on its feet” went to Play-
ground Supervisor Len Roberts who has
done a whizbang job.

The eight advisors selected for the
club are all teachers in the Anaheim
area. It was found that the teenagers
who make up the club are average and
above average students in school. An
interesting note concerning their dances
is that an attendance list is maintained
by the chaperons. All students must
check in at every function and follow-
ing the dance, the young people are
checked off as their parents arrive 'to
take them home.

Other social events include hay rides,
picnics, and snow trips to Big Bear.
The club has journeyed to Hollywood.
Pebble Beach, San Diego, and San
Bernardino.

The club has been averaging close
to fifty new members a month and
should hit the two thousand mark by
December 1962—an increase of 1650
sincc it opened its doors back in 1960.

In this era of ever-expanding leisure the recreation pro-
fessional must not only keep up with the times but with the
future. The seclulous recreation leader depends on profes-
sional meetings. workshops, and institutes to further his
knowledge of trends. new methods and techniques, and gen-
eral knowllow. Besides the annual National Recreation Con-
gress (see Page 337.), recreation leaders attend National
Recreation Association district conferences, state society
meetings, regional and local conferences. courses, seminars,
is orkshops, and institutes offered by universities as well as
by public and private agencies of various kinds. Here we
present a glimpse of a few of the many meetings held across
the country this spring.

Recreation for the

 

Mentally Retarded Child

As provided by a county parks and recreation department

Chuck Woods

MENTALLY RE-
TARDED chil-
dren have an un-
plumbed capacity
for joyful recrea-
tion! For some, it
may be merely the
joyous experience
of being with laughing children, the
pleasant feel of soft clay, or personal
praise from another for molding crude
figures. Others advance to more com-
plex recreation activities—such as sew-
ing, woodworking, tennis, or bowling.

Today’s hrighter life for the mentally
retarded child is a welcome relief from
the bleak and dull world facing him a
decade ago. Hidden in backrooms by

many parents who loved their children
but feared public ridicule, some young-
sters grew sullen and morose.

“A child is born and from all indica-
tions progresses normally for a period
of time” says Doctor George Tarjan,
head of Pacific State Hospital. “Gradu-
ally or suddenly, a change takes place
and as time passes the signs of physical,
mental, or social, or all factors of de-
terioration, become more and more
pronounced. Remorseful and humili-
ated parents then hide the child away
from society and begin to neglect the
very things most needed to comhat the
problem.

“Just as muscle tissue will deterio-
rate if not exercised, the processes of
deterioration will set in if the handicap-
ped child is deprived of normal physical
and social experiences.

“Years pass and the case, in despera-
tion, is finally brought to light and the

grief-stricken parents realize that it is
too late.

“Handicapped children, if given
early opportunities to learn skills
through normal play experiences, can
show remarkable progress but we are
extremely limited in our ability to meet
the need. Trained and dedicated recre-
ation people could exert a most potent
force upon the habilitation of handi-
capped children but there are not
enough of them.”

Today, there are more than six
hundred mentally retarded children
joyfully participating in recreation
programs provided by the Los Angeles
County Department of Parks and Rec-
reation. Organized four years ago at
the request of the Exceptional Chil-
dren’s Foundation, this project helps
improve the recreation activities offered
by the foundation, counsels other simi-
lar organizations, and helps parents of

at' .n. p; uzram. It is estimated that there
an three-hundred thousand victims of
mental retardation in California and
approximately five million in the United

IA

states.

An increasing birtllrate and the
inability of medical science to appre-
ciably prevent or cure mental retarda-
tion presents any county department
of parks and recreation with an ever
increasing field of responsibilities.
Three thousand of one hundred thou-
sand children born will be so severely
retarded they will benefit little or not
at all from regular school classes. Of
these, twenty-five hundred will be edu-
cable, with the ability to learn some
simple arithmetic and basic skills, four
hundred will be trainable in personal
care and social graces, and one hundred

will be totally dependent.

q LTHOUGH recreation programs must
embrace hundreds of mentally re-

tarded children, each child must be
given personal guidance. Aside from
the accepted differences occurring in
children, the mentally retarded young-
ster has varying degrees of mental and
physical disability which must be con-
sidered in planning effective recreation.

A common response displayed by
most mentally retarded children when
first enrolled in a recreation activity is
to sit idly and sullenly in the back-

ground. Frequently this response has
been engendered in their homes where
leisure time is filled with passive inter-
ests such as television and radio pro-
grams, and where many have become
so dependent upon their parents that
they lack confidence and have no desire
to improve.

For example, there is a four-year-old
boy who had never learned to walk or
feed himself at home. His parents car-
ried him about the house and spoon-fed
him at mealtime. Two years of training
at an institution, assisted by recreation
activities, have made this youngster
capable of walking and feeding himself.
There are still periods of retrogres-

356

sion, but much has been accomplished
through patient and understanding en-
couragement on the part of the recrea-
tion leader.

Another child suffers from schizo-
phrenia, commonly known as split
personality. His group was learning to
recognize colors and they were asked
to select felt squares of various colors
and place then on a flannelboard. As
others participated this child appeared
to be in another world giving no recog-
nition to activities around him. When
his turn came, the teacher took his hand
and led him to the flannelboard. The
felt square, placed in his hand, fell to
the floor when he failed to grasp it.
But by the time the teacher smoothed
the third square of felt with the child’s
hand, he looked at her and smiled, the
first sign of understanding of what he
was doing. He responded once more,
in anger because his hand was being
held while placing the felt square.

Wllen mentally retarded children
meet for recreation, a fertile atmos-
phere for learning is created. Since all
are suffering from retardation, each
has social acceptance within the group,
a desire to learn is respected, patience
in performing a simple act over and
over again is abundently displayed, and
praise is generous no matter how small
the accomplishment.

Another outstanding characteristic
of mentally retarded children is their
obedience during all activities. Nat
Rosenfeld, co-owner of the Canoga
Park Bowl, praises the behaviour of
a mentally retarded group which bowls
at his establishment. Given a choice,
he would rather have ten bowling alleys
used by this group than face a handful
of normal children.

A special recreation program for
mentally retarded childrcn is attended
by twelve children each Thursday, from
10AM to noon at Green Meadows Play-
ground. There they enjoy handcrafts,
music, games and free play on swings,
slides and other equipment. Most popu-
lar is the refreshment period.

A variety of objects are made from
clay. One day, Johnnie and Nancy sat
side hy side and each made a clay figure
of a child with matchstick arms and
legs and triangularly shaped red hats.
As the recreation leader praised their
work, Nancy looked at the identical

figures and said, “I made a girl and
Johnnie made a boy.” Only Nancy
could tell the difference. Another lad,
sitting at the end of the table, seemed
to love the feel of rolling clay beneath
his hand. When the clay grew long
and thin he identified it as a snake.

Six-year-old Carol stood against the
wall bubbling with joy. Every laugh
and pleasurable sound of the others
brought a smile to her face. Sometimes
she literally jumped for joy. A year
previously when she joined this group
she was sullen and stood quietly against
the walls of the room. Soon she will be
modeling with clay.

Next the group entered a courtyard
where they played with a beanbag.
Each child had his turn throwing to-
ward a clown target with an open
mouth. When a direct hit was scored
all children clapped hands in approval.
One child got so close to the target he
could practically drop the beanbag
into the clown’s mouth. Normal chil-
dren would call this cheating but not
this group. Any success at all called for
encouragement.

B ECAUSE of their love for music, one

of the most enjoyable activities for
mentally retarded children is participa-
tion in rhythm bands to the tune of
folk songs and dances. Prominent is
the musical heat which guides the
youngsters as they improve their mus-
cular coordination.

Folk danccs may start with a slow
walk and increase to light skipping
running cadences, but the more ad-
vanced groups dance the Virginia Reel
and othcr more complicated folk
dances. Frequently the musical count
is slower than normally used and in-
tricate steps are eliminated.

Words sung by children help teach
through repetition and are sometimes
accompanied by actions which help
cement ideas. One entire song required
the children to bend over and “Tap my

shoe.” Somc teach

good health and safety habits.

ONE of the most popular recreation
activities of the more capable

mentally retarded children and adults
is bowling. Ranging in age from thir-

RECREATION

teen to forty-five, one group of twenty-
five participants meets at the Holiday
Bowl each Saturday from 10AM to
noon. Two years ago, when first organ-
ized, the group required only two alleys
but now it needs five.

At the Canoga Park Bowl a group
now numbering twenty-four children
and adults from sixteen to forty-five
years old is entering its second bowling
season. Recently this group ntilized ten
alleys during a recreation period from
1 to 3PM.

Tennis is another sport popular
among the more advanced mentally
retarded children, but the game must
be adapted to fit their abilities. One
sixteen-year-old girl patiently batted a
tennis ball for two years before clear-
ing the net. Pleased with her personal
triumph, the entire group rejoiced and
she is still thrilled by her success. Once
control has been established, an effort
is made to maintain volleys. The first
one who fails to return the ball is the
loser. When skill is more advanced a
simple numerical count is kept for a
winning score.

Craft classes for girls also include
sewing, another successful activity for
more accomplished children. First those
participating made handbags and now
the project is a pajama bag. The boys
craft group, on the other hand. is
making shoe shine kits.

ASSUMINC the role of American 111-

dians, many mentally retarded
children shared a five day camping
period with normal children at the
“Rising Sun Day Camp.” Living as
Indians while camping, the children
hiked, enjoyed crafts, sang and danced.
On hiking trips, leaders interested them
in varieties of trees, grasses, bushes
and cacti. Many went to the nature
museum where they handled live snakes
and saw badgers, mice, rare birds,
salamanders, gila monsters, and turtles.
Most dramatic, for the children, were
festivities on Friday evenings when the
five-day ended.
Armed with tomahawks, artfully dres-
sed in head dresses of turkey feathers
and necklaces, and with colorfully
painted faces, the children looked like
Indians as they sang, danced, and
played in skits.

SEPTEMBER, 1962

Apprehensions of recreation leaders
about the social relationship between
mentally retarded children and normal
youngsters were soon dispelled. Not
only did the normal children associate
with the mentally retarded children,
but they understood and accepted them.
One little girl who disappeared was
found drinking punch with a normal
group of children who protested. “Does
she have to go? We were just getting
acquainted.”

TEN recreation leaders are under the
‘ guidance of Harold Swab, director
of rehabilitative recreation for the Los
Angeles County Department of Parks
and Recreation. Each year this group
conducts workshops for teachers and
parents who instruct children in schools
for exceptional children. Once weekly,
each class is visited by a recreation
leader who conducts recreation activi-
ties and counsels teachers who direct
recreation on other school days. These
leaders assume full responsibility for
recreation programs for retarded chil-
dren offered by the department.

The Mentally Retarded Children’s
Recreation Advisory Committee, com-
prised of doctors, psychiatrists, social
workers, teachers, and laymen is a con-
stant advisor to Harold Swah as well
as to the recreation leaders of the de-
partment. Currently they are consider-
ing the advisability of using power
equipment in the sewing and wood-
working craft classes.

Recreation objectives for some men-
tally retarded children are simply to
provide more joyous moments for this
is the limit of their capabilities. Others
improve their coordination enough to
adequately care for themselves becom-
ing less of a burden for their families.
Many qualify for unskilled jobs as
stock clerks in retail stores and packers
in factories.

These children who work so patiently
to drive a tennis ball over a net, who
welcome every success no matter how
small, and are so grateful to leaders
who guide them, have hurled a forceful
challenge which must be answered.
“When given a fair chance, how nearly

normal can a mentally retarded child
become?” #

remain unmarred, but many school cus-

A color—coded sizing board quickly
and automatically tells each potential
skater what color skate he should wear.

to the correct color-coded size among

occasions, bright-colored costumes add
fun and laughter. The public-address
system givcs two or threc supervisors
the voice and authority of many. Ac-
tivity is always “according to Hoyle”;
that is, according to specific types of
skating events rather than a “free for
all.” No racing, of course.

For further control, bright red sashes
with the word “GUARD” on them come
out of the Rollerama kit. The sash is a
blatant reminder to skaters to be care-
ful and take it easy and also identifies
aid in case of three-point landings.
There are always plenty of student
leaders seeking the privilege and re-
sponsibility of wearing the guard’s
sash.

When the skating period is over,
students help load up, and the travel-
ing roller rink is on its way—on wheels
to carry wheels of fun—elsewhere. Roll
on. Rollerama, roll on! #

each containing ten to twenty-one pairs of skates.

B. It is advisable to provide a secure storage place

where a minimum of moving after delivery will be
necessary.

When opening the boxes, check carefully to see how
skates are strapped together and packed. This will

help later when repacking for pick-up.

before entering skating area.

2. Each adult should be provided with a skate key. The

remaining keys should be attached with long cords to the
benches or chairs.

3. Instruct the adult who makes final inspection on the
skaters to be sure that:

A. The shoe extends at least one-half inch beyond the
skate. This is most important in maintaining the
finish of the gym floor.

B. Buckles are on the outside of the ankles.

CROWDED PLAY SPACE

 

 

WIDENS THE ACTIVITY GAP

There would be few problems of physical
fitness if children were active in daily walk-
ing and running as children used to be. Con-
stant, vigorous movement is Nature’s way
for children to grow strong and to keep fit.
But modern life widens a gap between the
children and the activity they need.

Riding instead of walking . . . congested play-
grounds . . . urban sprawl and population
explosion . . . keep children too often idle
and inactive. Too often they simply do not
have room in which to run. And when bad
weather holds them indoors, the activity gap
widens still more!

SAFE-T-PLAY GAMES
HELP CLOSE THE ACTIVITY GAP

From baseball to bowling, Sa fe-T-Play equip-
ment doubles and trebles the activities that
can be enjoyed in limited space, indoors or

out.

Unique “short flight” balls and flexible Poly-
ethylene equipment make vigorous games
SAFE on congested playgrounds and indoors.

THE 1902 recreation student inven-
tory is the most encouraging since
the beginning of these studies several
years ago, as shown by current findings
of the National Recreation Associa-
tion’s National Advisory Committee on
Undergraduate Education under the
chairmanship of Warren M. Bar-
tholomew, director of the recreation
curriculum at Temple University. These
student inventories continue to reveal
important information related to supply
and demand for recreation personnel.
The downward trend has been stopped,
at least temporarily, and a significant
increase in the number of recreation
graduates will be noted in the following
tahles. This, in spite of the fact that
thirty-one percent of the schools report-
ing major recreation curricula did not
report any recreation graduates for
1962. It does not mean that these
schools are not contributing something
to recreation, for they have students
who are minoring in recreation or who
are taking recreation courses to supple-
ment their preparation for service in
allied fields.

Forty-five schools, a twenty-eight
percent increase over the number re-
porting last year, indicated they would
graduate 758 recreation students this
year. This represents an overall i11-
crease of fifty-six percent over 1961.

There are two important observa-
tions: First, the total number of recre-
ation graduates is increasing, which is

MR. SUTHERLAND is director of the
Recreation Personnel Service of the
National Recreation Association.

encouraging from a quantitative point
of view. Second. the increase in the
number of students taking graduate
work is encouraging, for recreation
leaders in the future will have better
professional preparation for their work.
This is especially important at a period
when the recreation field is in stifi com-
petition with other worthy causes for
status and public acceptance and sup
port. The profession is at a point in its
development where it must go deeper
if it is to go further.

All districts except New England and
the Southwest showed substantial in-
creases. The Midwest increased 316 per-
cent, the Mid-Atlantic reported an in-
crease of 147 percent and the Pacific
Southwest 129 percent. Other increases
were 48, 21, and 14 percent respectively
in the Great Lakes, Southern. and Pa-
cific Northwest districts.

PERSONNEL

THE TIDE HAS TURNED

 

W. C. Sutherland

The schools report a total enrollment
of 2,254 recreation students; 1,737
classified as undergraduate and 517 as
graduate students. Seventy-one percent
of the schools identified their recre-
ation students as freshmen, four percent
as sophomores, and seventeen percent
as JUIIIOI‘S.

There are many reasons for the im-
proved showing in the recruiting of
students for the recreation curriculum.
They include the eil'ective leadership of
Dr. Janet Mac Lean of Indiana Univer-
sity and her predcccssors as chairmen
of the National Advisory Committee on
Recruitment; the work of the American
Recreation Society; the rapidly increas-
ing activities of the state recreation
societies and associations; and espccial-
ly the personal and individualized work
of executives and stali members of local
recreation departments. 4'"-

Bicentennial

The Charlottesville. Virginia, Daily
Progress, in its recent edition commem-
orating Charlottesville’s two hundredth
anniversary, published a twenty-page
culture and recreation supplement con-
taining articles on the history of the
city recreation department, its play-
grounds, parks, the Bayly Museum,
garden clubs, municipal band, the Vir-
ginia Players, football, golf, fishing,
and hunting activities. Nan Crow, di-
rector of recreation in Charlottesville
since 1937, spent many hours leafing
through invaluable scrapbooks and
documents to compile three articles on
recreation history and activities for the
commemorative edition.

Real George
George’s Island, the latest addition

to the Westchester County, New York,
park system, is a 137-acre tract on a
peninsula projecting into the Hudson
River. The county park system im-
proved the road into the park, added a
parking area for two hundred cars, a
modern circular picnic shelter of field-
stone and redwood, a large circular fire-
place with multiple cooking pits, play-
fields, restrooms, and paths down to the
riverfront. The former site of a brick-
yard, the island became a peninsula
when bricks and other waste materials
dumped into its marsh area gradually
connected it to the mainland.

National Recreation Policy
The Recreation Advisory Council of

the new federal Bureau of Outdoor Rec-
reation decided on a study of national
recreation policy at its first meeting.
Results of the study will help coordinate
and improve outdoor recreation efforts
by the federal and state governments.
Members of the council which was cre-
ated by the President’s Executive Order
are the Secretaries of the Interior, Agri-
culture, Defense, and Health, Education

The council also called for reports on
water pollution and for a closer coordi-
nation with the Defense Department on
the disposition of surplus defense in-
stallations. The need for more sccnic
roads was also discussed.

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

AN ESTIMATED four and a half million
persons in the U.S. are homehound

or chronically ill. Many of these people
exist in idleness and frustration because
their potential for useful activity and
meaningful experiences has no outlet.
The National Recreation Association
has just completed a two-year project
for the U.S. Office of Vocational Re-
habilitation entitled Meeting Some So-
cial-Psychological Needs of Home-
bonnd Persons Through Recreative Ex-
perience (RD-513) .

The NRA, in collaboration with the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York
and the Bellevue Hospital Homecare
Program, conducted this project to
demonstrate how a community’s public
and voluntary agencies can add the ben-
efits of therapeutic recreation to the
other essential services provided for the
homehound. The project’s specific aims
were:

0 To develop a comprehensive recrea-
tion program for the homebound pa-
tient.

0 To demonstrate the effect of thera-
peutic recreation in preventing further
pathology, in developing vocational po-
tential and in enriching the lives and
improving the mental health of home-
hound persons.

0 To demonstrate how the homehound
person can be enabled to make use of
existing community resources for rec-
reation.

0 To demonstrate how a professionally
prepared specialist in therapeutic rec-
reation can function as a staff member
of a health agency and assist the agen-
cy’s professional and volunteer workers
in expanding the scope of services ren-
dered to the homehound patient.

One hundred cases, fifty from each
agency, were selected for the project.
Cases were chosen on the hasis of great-
est need. The patients had to be willing
to come into the program. had to live
in Manhattan,,and physically appear to
have a reasonably good chance of re-
maining with the project for two years.
The age range was eighteen to eighty—
six.

The findings from patient interviews,
medical reports, and case histories

clearly indicated a need for recreation
services at four levels. These were on

a person-to-person basis in the home;
with a group of similarly handicapped
people in a centrally located activity
center; with the handicapped group on
trips into community recreation settings
and facilities; and with groups of non-
handicapped people in neighhorhood
clubs, centers, and similar recreation
settings.

All four phases of the program were
carried out during the two years of the
project. In addition, a group of the
homehound were taken on a vacation
trip to a farm in the Poconos for one

week (see “Homebound Holiday,” REC-
REATION, November 1961).

+ Nan Bracker of the University of
Indiana in Bloomington reports that
the following simple adaptation of Cat
and Mouse works beautifully with small
children (aged five to eight) with
speech or hearing defects, or other
handicaps, such as cerebral palsy, re-
tardation, polio, etcetera:

Set up an open, large cardboard car-
ton, with a hole cut in one side, large
enough to let a tennis ball in. The
mouse (child) lives in this hole (box).
He stands in the box. The other chil-
dren (cats) try to catch mousie by roll-
ing a tennis ball into the hole. When it
does go in, niousic is caught, and the
cat who rolled the ball takes his place.
Mousie goes to the bottom of the cat
line. Miss Bracker reports that the
youngsters play this game for a long
period of time and without supervision.

"h A bright hlue bus designcd for hand-
icapped patients has heen donated to
the Institute of Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation of the New York Uni-
versity Medical Ccnter by the Mary
Duke Biddle Foundation. The bus will
take institute patients to theaters, base-
ltall parks, and other recreation facili-
ties.

The cighteen standard seats on the
hus can be removed to make room for
ten wheelchairs, which are then fixed in
place by a special system. A side door
with a hydraulic lift allows wheelchair
patients to get in and out of the bus
easily.

ln accepting the gift, the institute°s
director, Dr. Howard A. Rusk, said that
it “will mean a new life for patients who
are immobilized with broken necks.
strokes, arthritis. and all the other trag-
edies that have kept them homehound.”

RECREATION

Voit balls are meant to knock around. We build
them as tough as balls can be made. Voit com-
position covers are the longest wearing ever
developed. Inside, our basketballs, soccer and
volleyballs are built with a nylon carcass,
machine wound in the shape of an icosahedron.
That means they’re wound from equidistant
points on a sphere for maximum strength in all
directions. They start round and they stay round.

 

Footballs don’t have icosahedron construction.
They’re not round. However, they are fabric
reinforced in multiple layers, and believe us,
they’re just as rugged. Voit balls feel right. . .
play right...meet rule book specifications. If
you’re not using them now, buy a bunch. You
should save enough money to get that extra
set of jerseys you’ve been scrimping for.
Besides having a ball that will last for years.

0 Dance recordings have carefully set tempos for use in
rhythm games, creative dancing, dance and drama, folk
dancing, ballet. Each album contains three ten-inch records
recorded with piano at 78 RPM for easy stop and go. The
music itself suggests ideas for movement. Movement sug-
gestions, music suggestions, story suggestions are included
in descriptive leaflet. For further information, circle #100.

0 Lines for safety, parking, or sports are easy to make on
cement, asphalt, wood, grass, and other indoor and outdoor
floor surfaces. This striping machine is available carrying
%-, 11/33 21/33 and 5-gallon capacities. Each of the four
models gravity-feeds paint directly through self-cleaning
multiple brass valves onto a roller. The latter applies the
paint uniformly so that the lines are always smooth and
sharp even on rough surfaces and heavily cracked wood
flooring. The line marker can roll on paint at walking speed
and produces straight, curved, continuous, or skip lines. It
can mark to within a half inch of a barrier, eliminating the
need to complete a line by hand painting. The marker can
also be used to make lines on curbs, pillars, walls, and other
vertical surfaces. For further information, circle #101.

o Three-wheel utility vehicles for various maintenance tasks
-—handling refuse, hauling brush, leaves, and gravel—are
useful in areas where visitors leave debris. When equipped
with a wire-screen drag, they perform leaf mulching. They
can haul gravel for road and walkway repairs and aid in
brush removal. They can replace wheel-barrows in hauling

can be used again and again. To provide maximum buoy-
ancy, the float has been enginecred to fit undcr tllc contours

Crushed Shell and Gravel Painting

Painting with colored
textural materials
such as dyed crushed
shell or dyed gravel
offered my class a new
and thrilling experi-
ence with design and
color. The finished
pictures and designs
- ,_. - Tit—e  _. A proved to be unique
and attractive little works of art of which the children were
very proud. The pearly luster of the crushed shell gave an
interesting iridescent quality to the pictures. A small art
object in cloisonnc enalnel was shown to the children and
they were interested to note that the artist had outlined his
design in wire and filled in the enclosed areas with enamel.

Materials Needed

1. 9”-x-12" Masonite board or 1A4” chipboard.
A selection of six colors of crushed shells or gravel.
Black braided cord approximately 3/16” diameter.
White glue (Elmer’s type) in squeeze bottle.
. Newsprint paper.
. Carbon paper.
. Pencils.
Sandpaper.
Scissors.
10. Clear plastic spray.
11. Crayons.
Procedure
Step 1. Each child sanded the edges of his own piece of
Masonite board.

   

Pedomeww

Step 2. The design and color scheme was worked out with
pencil and crayons on newsprint paper and approved by the
teacher. (Each child has three pieces of newsprint cut to
size.)

Step 3. The design was transferred to the Masonite with
carbon paper.

Step 4. The carbon lines were traced over with glue
squeezed from the bottle. Only a small section of the design
was done at a time.

Step 5. The braided cord was laid upon the glue-covered
lines carefully to preserve the exact outline of the design.
The ends of the cord were neatly cut and glued down.

Step 6. The background area was covered with glue, using
the fingers for spreading.

Step 7. While glue was still wet, the colored shell or gravel
was then carefully placed with the fingers over the back-
ground area, making it smooth and neat.

Step 8. The different parts of the design were then filled
in with contrasting colors of shell or gravel, being careful
that no stray pieces got over the cord into the background.

Step 9. The picture was allowed to dry thoroughly and was
sprayed with a clear plastic to ensure permanence—GALE

BRUCE, Palo Alto, California, Recreation Department.

$40 Saved I

Here is an idea we hit upon during the undecorating
period following the Christmas season to save crepe-paper
streamers for further use. These streamers can be re-rolled
very well on a 35MM film reel which has had the spokes re-
moved from one side. Using this reel on a regular 35MM
hand-rewinding machine enables one to reroll crepe stream-
ers from two to three inches for reuse. The streamers roll
nicely and can be stored away casily. Any local commercial
movie house may be able to lend or give the equipment to
the group desiring it or at least give information as to where
it can be obtained. In this way we saved $40 worth of
streamers which we could not have rerolled by hand—WIL-

The Metropolitan Problem and
American ldeas, Luther Halsey Gulick.
Alfred A. Knopf, 501 Madison Avenue,
New York 22. Pp. 167. $3.95.

In this small volume of a series of
lectures delivered at the University of
Michigan. Dr. Gulick deals with the
problems faced by all large American
cities and suggests how to make cities
livable, efficient, and a source of human
inspiration. He devotes relatively little
Space to traffic congestion, spreading
slums, crime, noise, lack of Open space,
and other widely recognized conditions
contributing to urban deterioration.
His concern is rather with how these
problems can be dealt with effectively
within the framework of American
ideals and government. Considered “the
dean of American public administra-
tion,” Dr. Gulick is chairman of the
board of the Institute of Public Ad-
ministration in New York and vice-
president of the National Recreation
Association. He will address the 44th
National Recreation Congress in Phila-

delphia on October 1, 1962.

His chapters dealing with the theory
and practice of government in the U.S.
afford a liberal education in various
aspects of the subject. In a relatively
few pages Dr. Gulick provides an en-
lightening interpretation of the prin-
ciples of American government at its
three major “extensions” (levels) and
of their application in current practice.
He points out that a “function” is made
up of many “aspects” and states, “The
function of . . . recreation is not a
single indivisible thing. [it1 is a bundle
of aspects.” He warns that “in all plan-
ning we must strive to keep the door
open for future choice.” He admits
that efforts to encourage and use neigh-
borhood group participation in the
processes of big urban government have
been extremely disappointing but he-
lieves that “the dream is powerful.”

He cites three shortages as reasons
for government failure in metrouolitan
areas: inadequate services; lack of a
comprehensive community program for
general development—“the ideas. the
places. the dreams are not pulled to-
gether”; and lack of regionwide demo-
cratic machinery for teamwork. He
suggests that we revise our thinking

376

Eli’UBLICATIONs

and realize that “we are not dealing
with a city at all” but with human
beings and their social and economic
manifestations.

Metropolitan requirements call for
all “extensions” or levels of American
government to take a hand in dealing
with the rising problems.” Dr. Gulick
indicates that the federal government
should “go into collaboration as a posi-
tive force, not as a shy and reluctant
dragon.” He asserts that the state holds
the key position in determining a way
of achieving a solution and lists the
basically “local activities” primarily
of concern to the local government.

In Dr. Gulick’s opinion the drive to
maintain small units of government can
be reconciled with the need for area-
wide “metropolitan” government by
two devices only. One is “the assump-
tion of the metropolitan responsibility
by a more extended unit of governmcnt;
that is, the county. the state, or the
nation; and the other is the creation
of a new local federated metropolitan
government . . . For most large sprawl-
ing metropolitan areas the only prac-
ticahle choice is a new metropolitan
federation of some sort.

All who read The MeIrOpolitan Prob-
lem may not agrec with the proposed
solutions but few will question the value
of Dr. Gulick’s contribution to this chal-
lenging suhject.—C. D. 8.

The publication of Children’s Thea-

tre serves three purposcs: a fitting trib-

ter to viewers and readers.

This volume is folio sized. contains
one hundred key photos illustrating the
steps in producing Tom Sawyer and 182
superbly reproduced photos depicting
plays in performance. The Kenneth

vides entrancing, visible proof.
