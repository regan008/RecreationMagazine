RECREATION

Gerald B. Fitzgerald

First of a series of editorials, in which outstanding leaders

What follows
here is composed
not of words
which have been
written for this particular occasion
alone, but rather, it is a grouping of
thoughts and beliefs which I have ex-
pressed many times through the spoken

 

or written word.

Recreation as we know it today is a
product of our social and economic
deve10pment. It is closely related to
but not with leisure,
which is also an outcome of the pro-
gress ° of our society. In pioneer
America one first looked forward to a
few hours of leisure, later to a day
of leisure, then to free weekends, and
to vacations—and now the older age
people to years of leisure after retire-
ment. People use their leisure in a
variety of ways, but chiefly in the pur-
suit of recreation interests. All leisure
activities thus are not recreation. To
be such they must be morally sound,
mentally and physically upbuilding,
respectful of the rights of others, volun-
tarily motivated, and provide a sense
of pleasure and achievement.

A descriptive definition is that rec-
reation is the natural expression of
certain human interests and needs seek-
ing satisfaction chiefly during leisure.
Recreation today is a part of living,
in all communities. Because it is this
it prospers in war and in peace, in
illness and in health, in depression and
in prosperity, and in disaster and in
tranquility. We have deve10ped rec-
reation in America to the point where,

synonymous

FEBRUARY 1953

in the field of recreation will offer their personal phil-
osophy of recreation, as a contribution to the over-all
philosophy of the recreation movement.

in both its organized and unorganized
aspects, it is a mirror of our beliefs,
our characteristics, our democratic
processes, the progress of our culture,
and our moral phi1050phy as a pe0ple.

Pe0ple are possessed of two basic
types of needs—those related to sur-
vival and those related to personality.
Recreation is primarily related to the
personality of developmental needs, al-
though it also has some relationships
with survival needs. Recreation can-
not be used as a substitute. It becomes
truly meaningful when basic survival
needs have becn satisfied.

The fundamental purpose of recrea-
tion, however stated, is to retain or
recapture for the adult the joy of life
as the child knows it. It is to help
the adult to retain the insatiable cu-
riosity of thc child, the zest for living,
his joy in new adventure, his pride in
creating things, his joy of companion-
ship, his sense of imagination, and his
desirc to learn.

Recreation may have certain by-
products such as improved health and
lower indices of delinquency, but these
are additional dividends and are not
foundational purposes.

Recreation ranks alongside work as
one of two of the several fundamental
activities of life. As the character of
work has changed so has the meaning
of recreation. Invention, science and
technology, and their effects upon the
nature of work for many millions of
people, have placcd a greater responsi-
bility upon leisure and recreation for

providing opportunities and expres-

sions for realizing the creative and
achievement needs of man. A simple
illustration of the loss of artistry in
work is that of the barber who shaves
himself with an electric razor in full
view of passersby.

Thus, to understand recreation, its
meaning and its potentialities, we must
first understand the society in which
we live, for recreation is nothing if it is
not a product of our social and eco-
nomic culture.

Recreation means different things to
different pe0ple and different things
to the same person at different times.
Whatever the choice of recreation may
be, it is certain that through it the
individual is seeking to satisfy some
inner need. The activity is merely the
vehicle that one uses to travel to his
destination of a sense of satisfaction
and achievement. To devote at least
a portion of one’s leisure to doing
something for someone else is one of
the highest forms of recreation.

Although recreation is chiefly a lei-
sure activity there are some fortunate
persons who find their means of liveli-
hood to be a part of their recreation
pattern. Attitudes toward required
duties and chosen occupations are the
factors that render indistinct the lines
of demarcation between work and rec-
reation. A basic distinction, however,
is that work is compulsory and recrea-
tion is voluntary. Those professions
which are accompanied by a sense of
social serviceship are most likely to
possess some recreation values. Thus
many recreation leaders find many of
the personal joys of recreation in their
work. To me one of those joys is the
sense of satisfaction and achievement
that I receive in writing about recrea-
tion, and this Opportunity has given
me an additional chance to practice
one of my recreations.

DR. FITZGERALD, Director of Recrea-
tion Training, University of Minnesota,
is interested in many phases of recrea-
tion. He has served as the chairman
of the recreation section of The Na-
tional Conference on Graduate Study
in Health Education, Physical Educa-
tion and Recreation (see his report -in
January RECREATION). He is also ac-
tive in the field of hospital recreation.

Directory
Sirs:

Several years back, your magazine
published the names of superintendents
or heads of recreation for the various
departments in the United States, and
it surely was a grand help to all of us
when we were attempting to correspond
with our fellow workers. That publi-
cation has been eliminated and I miss
it; and I voice the opinion of many
others. When someone comes up with
the question “Who is the director of
Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Hong Kong?”
it’s kind of nice to answer as to how
the person may be reached. Some day
when the NRA has a surplus amount
of paper, I wish they would publish
one of the monthly bulletins with the
names and addresses of the heads of
the departments.

ALICE DIETZ, Assistant Director,

Recreation Division, Board of Park

Commissioners, Minneapolis, Minn.

0 The 1951 Directory of Affiliate Mem-
bers and Active Associate Members of
the National Recreation: Association
carries some of this information. In-
dividuals are listed. Their titles are
not included, but may be in the future
if this proves to be desirable—Ed.

W'Iio Are You Kidding?

Sirs:

I don't know if Florence Anderson,
author of “Oil Painting. Why not try
it yourself?” is still writing for you,
or if she is still around to listen, but I
would like to say something myself,
concerning her article, and the general
line of thought in articles of its kind.

I happened to be perusing some back
copies of RECREATION and came across
a black and white print of a Daumier.
Next to it is Florence Anderson's ar-
ticle on oil painting. The copy is Feb-
rnary 19-18.

At the impact of the Daumier I was
carried back to my wonderful art-
school days and for a moment enjoyed
a nostalgic feeling of bliss. The bliss
that comes from being surrounded by
other student artists and full-fledged
artist instructors, exhibits, getting
one's first picture hung and so on. But
my moment of bliss was short lived for
I began to read Florence Anderson's
article.

She says: “Many a would-be-artist is
intimidated by the thought of oil paint-
ing.” lietter that they should remain
intimidated rather than become one of
those self-satisfied Sunday painters
such as Winston Churchill———one of
those whose taste ends with a bowl of
pretty flowers or a sugary landscape.

A little later: “A little courage
mixed with paint may even' result in a
master-piece, who knows?" . . . . lf

510

 

Daumier heard you say that you would
know in short order. He would have
gulfawed at you through the medium of
one of his more sarcastic cartoons.

Still later: “Painting is not dilIieult.”
Who is Florence trying to kid? Renoir
painted with arthritic fingers. Yes,
after years of grueling practice.

And the tools. Do you realize that
it costs close to $100 to set yourself
up for oil painting?

“There are no set rules in painting.”
Maybe not so straightforward as black
is black and white is white, but rules
all the same, and procedures and tech-
niqucs.

I can’t bear to go through the whole
article. And I can make my point with-
out all that. People can have fun paint-
ing without being artists. Sure. But
they won’t have much fun if they go at
it in a half-cracked way. You would
bc much better off to use four pages of
your magazine showing people how to
go about forming a painting class and
getting a proper instructor. Or else
just print a few Daumier’s so that I
can at least look at them without be-
ing assaulted by a lot of half-truths.

JIM JOHNSTON, Recreation Superin-

tendent, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

1! We appreciate Mr. Johnston’s point,
but we still maintain that you can have
a lot of fun with painting for your
own amusement, even though you can
never hope to be a Daumier or a Ren-
oir—and without great expense too!
Anyone else have any comments?-—Ed.

Television
Sirs:

I am beginning a thesis on the gen-
eral subject, “Use of Television by Cr-
ganized Community Recreation Pro-
grams.” I would like to gather as much
information on this subject as possible,

in order to (1) educate myself for
service in this field in the future and
(2) leave a report here at Syracuse
University which can be used as a
starting point for later student re-
search, both in the television and rec-
reation schools. Do you know of any
similar reports or articles? Has your
association done much in this line?
Have you any examples showing how
city recreation departments are using
TV? Have you the names of some
people in recreation who might be able
to supply additional information?
Jonx JARSTAD, 933 Maryland Ave-
mte, Syracuse, New York.

0 This whole subject of television in
public recreation programs is one
which has been of great concern and
interest to us, as well as to public ree-
reation departments. Actually, there
are several angles to it. Evidently, M r.
Jarstad is attacking it from the angle
of public recreation departments actu-
ally promoting and extending their
services through the medium of tele-
vision—in other words, actually put-
ting on recreation programs including
the teaching of skills in simple hand-
crafts, games that can be played at
home or in the backyard, the making
of favors and decorations for holiday
celebrations, storytelling, dramatics,
musical programs, square dancing and
other forms of dancing, and the like.
Another side of this question is the
effect that television has had. and is
having. upon the programs in com-
munity recreation buildings. We have
heard, for example, that some leaders
have found that their attendance has
jumped considerably when a television
set has been placed in the lounge.
Other recreation leaders have com-
plained that while more children and
adults may come to watch the tele-

RECREATION

vision, the other activities offered by
the center have suffered. We have felt
that if the latter is true, then the lead-
ers in those community recreation
buildings have failed to use the tele-
vision programs as motivations for the
other activities, or have not scheduled
the activities pr0perly, or have failed
to exercise proper control over the use
of the television set. RECREATION has
carried a number of articles about tel-
evision and the public recreation de-
partments. We refer to the following
issues: August, 1940; February, 1949;
January, 1950; March, 1950; Decem-
ber, 1950; June, 1951.-—-Ed.

Baseball Billiards
Sirs:

Speaking of “Old Games Into New”,
(see January 1953, RECREATION), I,
many years ago, was confronted in a
youth center with two pocket-billiard
tables that were forever busy and a
regular billiard table that was rarely
used. The boys felt that too much skill
was required for the latter game.

Anxious to see that every facility
was used, I tried to devise a number
of variations of the game, h0peful that
I might deve10p interest in billiards,
but the youngsters’ response was dis-
couraging. Finally one day, while
watching one boy idly practicing shots,
and, noting that he was sincerely try-
ing with but little success, I began to
toy with a new idea. As it took form,
I became enthusiastic myself and
called several boys over to outline my
new game.

Taking a cue, I told the boy who
had been practicing that he and I were
going to play a game of “baseball” and
that the other boys, in watching, could
evaluate the game for us.

I pointed out to the group that the
reason for their lack of interest was
that they missed so often, and that our
game would make use of that fact.
Also, that the two basic games of bil-
liards were straight or baulk-line and
three cushion, and that they could
adapt themselves to either.

Then came the first rules, two boys
to play. Each had nine turns (at bat)
at the table. They had to shoot until
they had three misses (outs) for a turn
(inning).

Successfully making a billiard, mak-
ing the cue ball hit first one, then the
other, constituted a single. If the cue
ball hit one cushion after hitting the
first object ball and then hit the other,
it was a double; a two cushion shot
was a triple, and a three cushion bil-
liard was a home-run.

The new approach to the game fasci-
nated the boys and they quickly re-
alizcd that they could simulate sacri-

lices as in baseball by deliberately
missing in order to set up the object
balls for easier billiards.

The response was terrific; before
that day was over we were starting
leagues; later, as skills improved, we
set up classes as in baseball with the
top players in major leagues and the
others in minor leagues waiting to
move up, but playing regularly.

With so many eager to play, we de-
velOped changes from the individual
game and formed, first, teams of three,
each to shoot in their inning until they
had made an out. Then it changed
again to teams of four, five, even up
to nine, each to shoot once in his turn
for a hit, or an out. And the interest
developed to the extent that they
wanted, and some did keep, (batting
averages) scoring averages! ! !

Many variations were tried, but
some four of the above were the most
p0pular. The table was always in use,
and for awhile, the pocket billiard
tables were ignored. Soon, interest
leveled off and these tables again re-
sumed normal play, but never once was
the billiard table idle—being occupied
with a baseball game, or even better,
with billiard players who, because of
the skills they had acquired in the im-
promptu game, saw that billiards could
be a challenge to them and a source of
satisfaction in accomplishment.

That was twenty-eight years ago.
Some form of this game is still played
in my home town, but it has never
been popularized elsewhere. My only
reason for writing this now is that
two weeks ago I attended a meeting in
a youth center, saw an idle billiard
table, some boys sitting around—and
took off my coat and started again.

As I left the center, I looked back °
and, seeing the crowd around the table
cheering the players in the game, re-
alized that possibly YOU might be
able to use this game in YOUR center.

A Moment of Decision

A few weeks ago I witnessed an im-
promptu little drama which demon-
strated that ways can be found of
bridging the gap between children of
different backgrounds and different cul-
tures.

On a clear moonlight night, I stepped
off one of two big trucks which had
brought American Girl Scouts and
their leaders from Heidelberg to a
German youth activities camp forty
miles from the city. The German girls
were to give a dramatic program for
the entertainment of their American
guests. As the American teen-agers
hopped to the ground, they found
themselves face to face with German
girls waiting to receive them. For a
moment both groups hung hack, con-
scious of the barriers that separated
them. Then one Girl Scout saw a
friend in the Gcrman group and
started moving toward her. In a mat-
ter of seconds, the ice was broken and
both groups rushed together, found
partners, and together enjoyed the pro-
gram and songs around a huge camp-
fire.

It is a reasonable assumption that
these children, when they becomc
adults, will not yield readily to easy,

damaging generalizations about other
races and other cultures, but, remem-

bering their friends and acquaintanccs
of childhood, will think of those basic

qualities of humannms that bind us

rather than of the learned differences
that separatc us.

“And a little child shall lead them.”
—Dorothy C. Stratton, National Ex-
eculive Director, Girl Scouts of

America.

Comic Book Rnting

Although comic books havc becomc
established as a new media of com-
munication (sales, as reported in 1951,
totaled 80,000,000 copies per month)
—there still remains a controversy on
what effcct they may have upon the
juvenile mind. In this connection,
Parents Magazine reports in their 170-
vember, 1952, issuc, an annual rating
prepared by a Cincinnati Committee on
the Evaluation of Comic Books. This
grew out of the need, felt by a group
of parents, for help with thc comic
book problem.

Their evaluation shows, among other
things, that the proportion of comic
books dealing with crime has remained
about the same over the last few years,
but that today there is a sharp increase
in war comics—nearly all of which are
poor, according to the committee's
standards.

5M

 

Editorially Speaking

After months of work the committee
was ready to group these books into
four categories: those to which there
was no objection, some objection, ob-
jectionable and very objectionable. On
this basis, only sixty per cent were
judged suitable for children and young
teen-agers.

Congressional Hearings

According to The Pubfishers’
W cekfy, the Gathings Committee in-

vestigating “immoral, obscene or
otherwise offensive matter” and “im-
proper emphasis on crime, violence
and corruption” in books, magazines
and comic books was scheduled to
go into action on the first of Decem-
ber, 1952.

A similar committee, a subcom-
mittee of the Interstate Commerce
Committee, has held hearings in New
York and Washington on the inci-
dence of juvenile delinquency in
relation to radio and TV programs.

The American Book Publishers
Council has announced that it will
closely follow the Gathings commit-
tee hearings.

Games

\Vhy play games at all? Games in
the remote past had religious signific-
ance; for some they remain a cult if not
a religion. Later they were looked
upon as a form of military training;
for many they are still a battle. A book
on games would not be worth writing if
games had no real meaning here and
now. It is intcrcsting that thc secret of
both enjoyment and success in games
is concentration. A man is happy not

when hc says “I am happy,” but when
he forgets himself altogether and con-
centrates entire attention on work or
play. Then time ceases to exist. A man
wins a game not when he says “I must
win,” but when he concentrates ruth-
lessly on the point to be won, the ball
to hit or the pieces to be moved on the
board. The happy-go-lucky player en-
joys his gamc and as long as he remains
lucky remains happy, but he would
enjoy it more should he forget his mask
of happy-go-lucky. The essence of a
game is individual or team competi-
tion. It is not unsporting to try to win,
it is irrelevant not to, an insult to an
individual opponent to fail in concen-
tration and sabotage to a team of which
you are a member. The phrase “he
takes his games too seriously” is silly,
for every good player takes his game
seriously; the better player you are
the more enjoyment you give and gain.
No, the player who is angry when hc
loses doesn’t concentratc enough—that
is, he doesn’t take his game seriously
enough—and that is why he loses. To
the true games-player the game itself,
the changing pattern, the playing of
each shot, is all-important, not “I win-
ning” or “I losing.” Afterwards, per-
haps, when he emerges from the gamc
he may feel disappointed that he has
lost and may remember with rage or
amusement incidents which were brief
irrelevancies at the time. But that’s
afterwards, and to the worker who loves
his work and the player who loves his
game, afterwards is unimportant. Con-
centration, plus sheer spontaneous ex-

uberance. makes the best kind of

games-player.

Games after all are not only games,
they are games, just as an elephant is
not onfy an elephant, it is an elephant.
Games are also rituals, patterns and
symbols of life itself, and as such have
a meaning bcyond “my enjoyment,”
“your cnjo'ment,” teaching a great
deal more than the psychology of 0p-
ponents and all the methods of play.
As symbols they can at once be rejoiced
in and treated with rmpect as the
myStCrious providers of that intense
peace which is both action and contem-
plation.—F'rom Dictionary of Games,

Excerpts from a research. projeet

THE search for a philosophy of recreation is much like
the hunt for the elusive “Scarlet Pimpernel.” The logi-
cal sequence of such a search entails the primary need of a
definition, for which we turn to Webster’s New interna-
tional Dictionary, unabridged, 1951, which states:

RECREATION [ME recreacioun, fr. OF recreation, fr. L.
recreatio.] 2. Act of recreating, or state of being recre-
ated: refreshment of the strength and spirits after toil;
diversion: play; also a mode or means of getting diversion
or refreshment. Synonym: see Play. Antonym: see Work.

It is easy to see that there is a vastness to the subject
which would enable us to venture into the fields of every
imaginable occupation of man. The ramifications are aptly
described in the classic of recreation thought, Viscount
Crcy’s speech on recreation before a group of Harvard un-
dergraduates after the first World War.1 Grey spends much
time discussing the manifestations of recreation, pointing
out that recreation is that which each man considers his
most pleasurable diversion, and he mentions, as an ex-
ample, the fact that the deep profound study of philosophy
has been his own recreation on many occasions.

The separation of recreation from work is a principle
which many leading educators oppose, pointing out that
there are many instances where men love and enjoy their
work, and having created no tension through their work
are not in need of recreation as it commonly applies to
others. Joseph Lee, one of the fathers of recreation, also
disagrecs in that he maintains that play is recreation for
adults since it is a renewal of life, whereas it is a gaining
of life for children, thus being a creation rather than a
recreation. But in both cases he holds that the term recrea-
tion must include: music, drama, crafts and all free activ-
ity, especially creative activity which enriches life.

Mr. Iiutlcr’ points out that whereas building a boat may

be one man’s hobby, it is another man’s work. Still further
he maintains that the element of physical preparedness
enters the matter a great deal, citing as an example the fact
that ordinarily dancing may be a form of recrcation, but if
the parties participating in the dance have reached a point
of fatigue, the activity takes on the aspects of work.

It is plain that definitions of recreation vary; and though
there is agreement on its nature and function, there is con-
fusion in formulating the definitions. Since the lines of de-
marcation belwccn recreation and ordinary types of occu-
pation are not always clear, we try to interpret its mean-
ing by saying that it is not always what someone does,
but rather it is the motive, attitudc and value of the doing,
to the individual, that gives the activity a recreational sig-
nificance.

Historical Background

Recreation reaches back to the beginning of man, in-
creasing in scope and importance, through the unrolling of
the centuries, as work became more arduous and leisurc
time more plentiful. . . . . \Vhen the scientific period arose
in philosophy, its counterpart arose in recreation and play.
A greater desire for understanding of the workings of
man’s mind and body brought out a more scientific and
philosophic approach. Health came to be more important.
Great thinkers and educators of the period made play and
recreation part of their plans for better living.

Thc present period of social relationship is the highest
plane reached by recreation since the golden age of Greece.
Though there is considerably less emphasis placed on the
aesthetic approach of the Greeks, it is by far more encom-
passing, fostering more of the spirit of democracy. As the
social sciences have caught up with the natural sciences.
recreation and play have come to be more than a set of con-
(litioners for the body or for the state. Man and his rela-
tionship with man has come to be the outstanding feature
of recreation in this period.

Justification of Recreation

The late President Roosevelt, in a 1942 report to Con-
gress, included among the basic frecdoms the following:
“THE RIGHT to rest, recreation and adventure; the op-
portunity to enjoy life and to take part in an advancing
civilization.” ScldOm given adequate notice or emphasis,
this freedom is as important as education itself. In fact

‘ RECREATION

Aspects of Recreation

there are increased tendencies to give recreation a place in
the collegiate physical education curriculum as a basic
course. One need only to pick up any standard physical
education textbook to find among its aims a list which will
always contain a provision for the preparation of the child
for the use of leisure time in later life. Mortimer J. Adler
explains its relation to education very aptly when he says:

It is a mark of wisdom in Greek political thought that the
form and content of education receive primary consideration
from those who are concerned with the nature and the welfare
of the state. Education, is, of course, broadly conceived; it is not
limited to the problems of a school system, to the administration
of ofhcia] pedagogues and the curriculum of instruction. What-
ever can be taught is educational matter; anything that shapes
the body, forms character or gives knowledge or discipline to the
mind, is an agency of education, whether or not its human
medium is a person having the social status of a teacher, whether
or not the environment in which it occurs is a school.8

Adler further enlightens the path of recreation’s cause by
a quote from Aristotle’s Politics:

Life . . . . is devoted to lahor and rest. The politician who
composes a body of laws ought, therefore, to extend his views to
both. The citizens should be fitted for rest and pcace, as much
as, if not more than, for labor and war. It is to these objects that

the education of children ought to tend.

The legislator who did not teach his citizens how to rest
would be greatly at fault; many social disorders arise from
this failure. However there is a word of caution espoused
by Plato, when he warns that seeing that the means of rec-
reation may have an educational influence should not pre-
vent one from seeing that they are means of recreation.
The aims of recreation are not the same as those of educa-
tion, though the same means may serve both ends and
though both recreation and education are necessary for a
good life.

Lebert H. Weir exprcsses the matter well when he says:

Rccreation in an intelligently ordered life needs no excuse or
reason for its existence. It is merely a fundamental part of a
rhythm of daily existcnce. It was not a problem among so called
primitive people. It became a problem only when society be-
came more highly organized (civilized), and motives of material
gain hecame dominant, leading to an over emphasis of work.
This was not so unfortunate in itself until science and invention
placed into the hands of the materialists the tools which took
much of the joy and satisfaction out of work. Recreation then
became a social prohlem. It represented an element of life that

needed to be recaptured. . . .‘

The Pragmatic VieWpoint

The pragmatist is not primarily interested in the high
sounding moral phraseology of the idealist or in the scien-
tific hodge-podge of the realist, but is desirous of obtaining
a way for man to live at peace with and in his environment.
Basically he believes recreation should satisfy desires and
give immediate and direct satisfactions. The doing, rather
than the competition, is the important thing. In no other
philosophy is the individual of greater importance. The
late Howard Brau'cher, pioneer in the recreation movement
and late president of the National Recreation Association,
stated:

The recreation movement is founded on the recognition of the
dignity and the worth of the individual human being; . . . . this
makes it impossible for the recreation worker to plan to violate
the individual’s personality by trying to fix facilities and leader-
ship so that the person is not free to be the person he wants to
be, fto do the things he wants to do, in time that is supposed to
he ree.

Emphasis on the value of doing is further pointed up by
Professor Mary Whitley when she says, “In brief, any
play through which a child is led to acquire information,
to develop skill, to exercise aesthetic judgment or to gain
practice in solving problems may be said to be educative-—
to the degree that the facts learned, or the power produced,
have values in themselves.”5

High school curriculums are becoming increasingly al-
tered to include games, crafts, dances and other means of
recreation which can be used well into the later years in
life. As mentioned before, the college curriculum is be-
coming increasingly aware of the need of recreation, with
the result that some few now offer doctorates in recreation.
It is the pragmatic school that is pushing recreation into
the spot of prominence wherein it now stands.

John Dewey, our foremost pragmatist said, “If educa-
tion does not afford opportunity for wholesome recreation,
and train the capacity‘for seeking and finding it, the sup-
pressed instincts will iind all sorts of illicit outlets. . . . .
Education has not more serious responsibility than mak-
ing adequate provision for enjoyment of recreative leisure;
not only for the sake of the; immediate'health, but still
more, if possible, for the sake of its lasting habits upon
the mind.”

CREATIVE

Talk about excitement! This morning a kinkajou ar-
rived at the. Junior Museum. Children greeted her with
open arms and how she enjoyed filling them. Koko and
Moko immediately protested her taking up her abode in
the animal room. They are our adorable and badly spoiled
ringtail monkeys. They insist upon getting much more
than their share of the attention. They are not fond, either,
of Sugar, the groundhog, for we all love to play with her
and watch her sit up very straight when she eats. With
children watching them, Sugar and Nibbles, our white rab-
bit, may run all over the museum, upstairs and down. They
need to be guided away from such things as African vio-
lets, which Nibbles docs enjoy munching on, or ferns which
Sugar cats in a hurry. They both are given plenty of green
salads in their daily menus but they somehow prefer the
museum plants.

If they venture downstairs, they like to investigate the
wet elay things wrapped up on the workroom shelves. Cer-
amies is one of our specialties at the Junior Museum.
Though we. do all crafts, clay work is preferred because it is
easily approached from the. creative viewpoint. Everything
done in our workshop is entirely creative. No green ware
is brought in, no rubber molds for plaster objects, no (le-
signs to be traced or copied. Our purpose is to help chil-
dren live t'reatii ely, to help them to explore and to realize
what a wonderful world we do live in, how much there is
to do and learn in their leisure time. and that it is so thrill-
ing that it tan not be left alone. We hope to tease them
with a little knowledge in a lot of fields so that they may
further pursue those of most interest to them. We hope we
are teaching a wav of living. Though such an approach
is much more (liflienlt, we have found that the rewards are
satisfying. \‘ hat youngsters make and take home may not

be as perfect as though it were made with a well worked
out pattern and decorative design by the instructor; how-
ever, parents of our youngsters quickly get the idea and
realize that what happens to their youngsters is more im-
portant than the articles they bring home.

Richard and Kenneth, twelve and fourteen, have been do-
ing a project for the museum that is startling to tourists
and extremely interesting to all who see it. Both boys have
worked for several years in ceramics. They have recently
completed two elaborate scenes, each made entirely of clay.
Each scene fills a regular size glass museum case. One is
prehistoric Oregon, the other pioneer Oregon. Kenneth
studied prehistoric animals and vegetation and made them
most realistically. Richard has a covered wagon, stockade,
and pioneers sitting around a campfire; Mt. Hood shows
in the distance. The ideas are entirely their own.

When Nibbles gets into our doll room she really has to
be watched, for she likes to nibble on the little reed rocking
chair holding one of our big dolls. We have a wonderful
doll house with electric lights, electric elevator and a large
yard with a swimming pool. The furniture is very elabo-
rate and beautiful. Children never tire looking at it.

Our usual museum exhibits are in low, attractive cases
so that children may enjoy them. We have many school
groups coming during the school year. They often take
back to school with them a guinea pig, a baby alligator, or
a bird for a two-week visit.

Often an excitcd youngstcr (lashes up to one of the staff
with the information that a mother hamster is having ba-
bics or that little rabbits are arriving. Valuable lessons are
learned in a natural way in the animal room.

Continual teaching and plenty of patience seem to be
necessary to make adults and children realize the difference
between playing with animals and teasing them. Teased
animals become mean very quickly and we could not have

them around the children, nor could we play with them. It
is important that children learn such lessons early and we
find they are the best teachers for parents, and other adults,
along this line.

We often have exhibits of children’s work from other
places—right now a most fascinating one of Japanese chil-
dren’s paintings from Kulnanioto.

We are fortunate in our administrative heads in Port-
land. They have found the real values of recreation which
have, in every activity or field of interest, been kept simple
and sincere, cooperative rather than competitive. They
have kept statistics in their proper place and have stressed
the importance of quality and real accomplishment rather
than exhibitionism. Our museum, as it is now, could not
function under any other administrative philos0phy.

The prehistoric Oregon exhibit, planned and executed by
Kenneth, fourteen years old, was made after he had studied
prehistoric animals and vegetation. It is amazineg realistic.

Family “At-Ilomes”

If: the “good old days” families used
to play games together in front of
the fireplace or stay at home for other
family-centered activities. There seems
to be little of this today. We’re all too
busy belonging to organizations that
take us out of the home.

Naturally, we can’t go back to fifty or
one hundred years ago, nor would we
want to do so. But some families have
found that spending a few evenings to-
gcther every month is a lot of fun. . . .

Perhaps ten-year-old Billy has just
discovered a scientific experiment that
he wants to show the rest of the family.
Lucille is anxious to put on a puppet
show. Dad’s got some new shots with
his color camera for all the family to
look at.

Some families have set aside certain
evenings when the informal program is
designed especially for the younger
children. Then, every one pitches in
and makes it fun for the small fry.
Other evenings are beamed at the in-
terests of the older children. The
younger ones may stay for a while and
then go off to bed.

Dad and Mother have their evenings,
too. Perhaps Mother reads some short
stories she likes particularly. Dad may
have the rest of the family help him
with his stamp collection. Yes, there
can be many exciting things to do to-
gether in these “at-home" evenings if
one keeps on the lookout for them.

FAMILY

CENTERED
ACTIVITIES

Homemade Tahle Croquet

A set of checkers, a few pieces of
pliable wire, a dozen and a half corks.
and some glue are all the ingredients
you need for making the equipment for
table eroquet.

Single checkers are used in place of
balls. Five checkers are glued to-
gether for each of the two pegs needed
at the end of the croquet “court.”
Wiekets are made from wire inserted in
corks.

The game is played on a bare dining
room table, the ping-pong table, or
some other suitable surface. For active
children who don’t mind getting down
on hands and knees, the floor makes a
suitable court.

Checkers are used just as balls
would he, and are propelled with the
index finger. You and the youngsters
may he surprised to discover how simi-
lar the game will seem to full-blown
croquct. It can be a lot of fun for a
rainy-day activity or for other times
when children must play indoors.

The Match and Bottle Came

Here’s a game of skill for “old
folks” and children. lt takes a lot of
patience as well as a steady hand. But
it‘s a lot of fun.

All the equipment needed is a milk
bottle and a supply of wooden kitchen
matches. The trick is to see how many
matchcs can be piled on top of the
open bottleneck in a long-cabin fashion.

Each player is given the same num-
her of matches. 'I'wcnty-five to fifty is
a good number with which to start.
The first player places one of his

Dr. Ernest C. Osborne

matches over the bottleneck. Then, in
turn, all the other players do the same
until one gets rid of all his, thus win-
ning the game.

Anyone who knoeks match-es off the
bottle is penalized by having to take
all those that drop. Should a player
drop a match inside thc bottle he must
accept a “gift” of one match from each
other player.

Popcorn Balls

Popcorn balls have been a favorite
with youngsters for a good many gen-
erations. Some times we forget what
fun we had making thcm when we
were children, and deprive our young-
sters of the experience.

Do you remember how to make
them? Add a half-cup of sugar to
three-quarters of a cup of molasses.
Cook the mixture until it makes a soft
ball. Pour over popcorn and with hut-
tcred hands mold mixture into balls.

An Odds-aml-Ends Treasure Chest

Rainy days eome surprisingly often.
Youngsters find themselves without

 

anything to do. Or they get into mis-
ehief because they're bored with their
games and toys.

RECREATION

Here’s a suggestion that may help
meet tbese situations. Get a sturdy
wooden box and hinge a cover on it.
With the help of the children, it can
be decorated .with paint and brass-
headed tacks so that it looks as though
it were a treasure chest. Then begin to
collect odds and ends that can be used
for toys that youngsters like to make
and play with.

A piece of broomstick from which
wheels can be sawed, spools, paper salt
boxes, paraffined milk containers, bits
of yarn. These are but a few of the
many things that can be stored away
for the rainy day or the idle hour. A
scroll saw, tack hammer, a couple of
small carving tools, nails, tacks, and a
tube of glue provide the tools needed.

You’ll be surprised and the young-
sters pleased with the autos, boats,
houses, and a thousand and one other
small toys that can be made from such
simple things. A few cans of enamel
paint and some cheap paint brushes
can be used to add color and finish to
the treasure chest products.

 

Hoops With Bells

Did you ever play with a h00p when
you were young? One doesn’t see too
many today. Somehow they seem to
have become old-fashioned. But it’s a
pretty sure thing that even modern
young children will get a lot of fun out
of hoop play.

The Association for Childhood Edu-
cation tells, in one of their bulletins,
how to make a very attractive h00p.

Get a wooden hoop from a large
sugar or flour barrel. File down the
nails and sandpaper the hoop until it is
smooth. Paint the outside red, divide
the inside into sections and paint them
alternately with red, white, and blue.
You can work out other color combina-
tions, too. Get some small metal bells

FEBRUARY 1953

and fasten them inside the h00p with
metal staples.

A stick about twenty inches long,
also painted and with a bell fastened to
its outer end, completes an attractive
and funful piece of play equipment
that is both lively and musical.

Backyard Play Materials
for the Young Child

Boxes and barrels, available from the
corner grocery, can be used to equip
the backyard for the under-fives in a
most satisfactory way. Children of
these years can hardly have enough
boxes.

Small crates, such as those in which
dried prunes or apricots are packed,
make fine wagons or sleds to be dragged
about with dolls or toy soldiers as pas-
sengers. Larger, sturdier ones, after
they are well smoothed and sanded to
avoid splinters, will serve as boats,
trains, and airplanes—almost anything
in the imaginative play that young
children enjoy so much. A barrel open
at both ends is lots of fun, too. It can
be rolled around, crawled through,
stood on end, used as a hiding place.

A broad flexible plank an inch and
a half in thickness and ten to twelve
feet long is another useful and fascinat-
ing piece of equipment. Supported on
two low boxes, it makes a fine umping
board. It also can be used as an incline
down which wheeled toys can be rolled.
Children will find many other uses for
such a board, along with the boxes
and barrels.

Other “junk” too, makes excellent
play material for older children. Old
bricks which the youngsters, them-
selves, can clean of mortar, two-foot
lengths of telephone poles, lengths of
pipe, a set of assorted boards, packing
cases, empty wooden boxes and tin
cans are “t0ps” for the building ac-
tivity the school-age child loves to
carry on.

Backyard Merry-Go-Round

A homemade merry-go-round needn’t
cost you more than a dollar, and it will
bring endless fun to your youngsters.
All you need is an old wagon wheel of
generous width, one which is still at-
tached to its axle.

For the smaller fry, the axle itself
can serve as the upright. Dig a hole

that will accommodate half the length
of the axle. Then pour cement around
the Upright axle, grease the bearing so
that it turns easily, and it’s done.

 

Youngsters love to sit on the spokes
as the wheel is turned by accommodat-
ing playmates. Alternatively, they can
hang from the spokes and propel them-
selves around.

Older children will have more fun if
the wheel is rigged on a taller upright.
Ropes may be attached so that several
children can swing themselves out into
space as they run full tilt around the
pole. This is not dangerous, and is
loads of fun.

Clock Golf in the Backyard

Even a small yard can be used for a
game that’s lots of fun for the whole
family—clock golf.

The setup is simple. First, draw a
circle twenty-four feet across. It can
be smaller if necessary. Then sink a
tin can in the center. If you’re going
to use a golf ball, the can need only be
a small one. If a croquet ball is what
you- have, you’ll naturally need one of
these large cans. Now on the rim of
the circle you have drawn, drive in
twelve stakes at the spots where the
numbers on a clock would fall. It’s a
good idea to paint the t0ps white so
they can easily be seen, for the stakes
should be driven in until they are level
with the ground.

The first player starts at one o’clock
and tries to drive his ball with a golf
club or croquet mallet into the can.
Should he succeed the first time, he
goes on to stake number two. If not,
it is the next player’s turn. Later,
when skill develops, the game can be
made harder by roughing up the
ground or putting obstacles in the way.

The winner, of course, is the person
who first completes all twelve shots.

' How to Tell a Good
GOLDEN-ABE CLUB

S oeial clubs and organized recreational activities for
older people are now appearing in most of America's com-
munitics. The indications are that this trend will increase
in the future. As yet we have no definite standards by
which we can assess the success or failure of these pro-
grams. It is entirely possible that activities may be so con-
ducted as to do more harm than good to the older men and
women who take part in them. Professional recreation
workers are sensitive to the needs of children because this
is an area in which a great deal of study has been done.
These same workers are sometimes uncertain of the needs
of older people and as a result the goals for their program
planning in this area may be vague or nonexistent.

Do you believe that scventy- or cighty-ycar-old persons
are capable of growth. of benefiting from new experiences?
Do you think they are still able to learn? If they have not
reached full emotional maturity at their advanced age, do
you believe that it is still possible for them to achieve it?
Even if your answer is “yes” do you believe that it is worth-
while trying to do something about it in view of the rela-
tively short amount of time they have left at their disposal?
Do you see recreation and social group work as a means of
achieving these ends?

Your answer to these questions will determine the con-
tent of your program for older people and the manner in
which it will be conducted. A lot of activities for older
people now provided at community expense are merely
ways of helping them pass the time. This is better than
nothing because many old people are bored and need sug-
gestions and assistance in doing this. Is it enough? Is the
community getting its money's worth when it provides stall
time and physical facilities for such an elementary type
of operation? More important still, is the older person be-
ing cheated and deprived when all he gets are endless
games of bingo, pinochle and oeeasional community sing-
ing? These items have a place but they ought not to be the
whole program. When they are used it ought to be with a
conscious knowledge of why they are used.

It is true that many older people ask for a simple type
of program because they are not familiar with anything
else. Some of them, as a result of long years of habit, ap-
pear to be satisfied with very passive activity. If this were
the only test, then recreational planning and group guid-
ancc would be unnecessary skills. If these are really treated
as skills the recreation worker will take his clients at what-
ever level he finds them and then go on to enlarge their
imaginations, their emotional resources and their abilities
to get more out of life.

The older person will have needs of which the program
advisor may be more conscious than they. He will. through
his program, find ways of meeting those needs that will
prove more satisfying than anything they could devise un-
aided. it is a step-by-stcp process like any other piece of
education. There is nothing dictatorial or patronizing
about it. We accept this as standard practice in working
with children and youth. Why shouldn’t the same principle
be true in working with the golden-agcrs' groups?

The reason for these remarks is that so much time, effort
and good intentions go into our golden-age programs that
it seems a sad waste of these valuable commodities not to
let them function at their best. The last years of life ought
not to be thought of as a period of marking time until death
comes. They are given to us for living just as much as in
the earlier half of life.

A visitor from abroad once made this comment about
our recreational programs for older pc0plc: “I have got
the impression that sometimes you in America treat your
old people as though they were something in a circus or
sideshow. If they are capable of doing anything at all you
publicize and parade them around like prize horses for
everyone to see.” That criticism seemed unfair at the
time, but I wonder if it did not touch on a very counnou
weakness to be found among the general publie and some-
times, even, among professional workers. Too many people
regard older men and women as somewhat in the nature
of curiosities, different from the rest of human kind. When
they fall in love, do a good job of work, show themselves
interested in the same things that bring pleasure to the
rest of the world, it is looked upon as a matter of surprise

Rscnmnos

and wonderment. Community attitudes towards older
pe0ple need to be changed. Does your recreation program
help to provide this kind of education?

Here are some questions to ask yourself about the gold-
en-age clubs or club with which you may be connected.
The purpose of setting them down here is to emphasize the
structure and function of these groups.

(1) Who makes the club decisions?

Does one person make them or does everyone have a
chance to express Opinions? Strong personalities always
have a lot of influence in a group; but no club, in the long
run, will be a strong one if it is dominated by the advisor,
the president or one of the members. Even when members
are willing to sit back and let one individual run the show,
it will prove harmful if it is continued.

In a new club it usually takes a little time for the mem-
bers to learn about group discussion and how to arrive
at a group decision. It can be learned.

 

Jovial dancers from the Cleveland Golden-Age Club have a
good time while they entertain their fellow elub members.

(2) Is there a varied program?

Does the program appeal to many different intcrests_or
do the card and bingo players have everything their own
way? Do the members help to plan the program through
the use of a committee or a program chairman?

(3) What kind of atmosphere is there in the club meeting?

Is it apparent that the members like each other? Do
they welcome strangers in a friendly way. When a mem-
ber returns after an absence is he made to feel that he has
been missed and that the members are glad to have him
back? How does the group take disagreement among the
members regarding some piece of club procedure? Are
they willing to accept the results of democratic proced-
urcs? Do people cooperate with each other or do you find
the same people preparing the refreshments, arranging the
chairs and doing other chores?

(4) Does the club have its own o§icers?

Does the club have periodic elections of its officers or

does it rely completely on the advisor or one member who

Frnntunv 10*:‘2

stays perpetually in oflice?
(5) Does the club ever do anything for anybody else?
What happens when the Community Fund drive comes
along? Or the Red Cross drive? Do the members feel
that they have a concern in the problems of the community
or are they only concerned about receiving things them-
selves? The gesture of giving is more iInportant than the
amount. Do any of the members ever give their time to
short-term volunteer service?

(6) How independent is the club?

Who pays for the club refreshments and who serves
them—the members or well-meaning outsiders? Letting
others help is all right for the first few meetings until the
club is organized and on one or two occasions throughout
the year. A club can easily be killed by kindness. Are out-
siders permitted to pauperize the members by doing too
many things for them for nothing?

(7) What happens when the club is invited out?

When the club receives an invitation to do something out-
side of the regular club meeting is the reSponse apathetic
or enthusiastic? It is possible for a club to get so ingrown
that it loses all interest in events other than its own meet-
ings. Lack of interest in outside events is often preliminary
to lack of interest in the club itself.

(8) What happens when a speaker is invited to the club?

Speakers who have gone to golden-age clubs sometimes
complain that members have been known to play cards be-
fore the talk was over, or that members sometimes carry
on conversations while the talk was in progress. What this
comes to is—how considerate are they toward others?
Does your club remember to send a “thank you” letter
when something is done for it?

(9) Does the club remember its sick members?

Is there a sick committee to make periodic visits to the
ill members and then report back to the club? Are the ab-
sent ones remembered with cards? Is there someone in the
club who is responsible for sending letters of condolence?

(10) What kind of publicity does the club receive?

Does it portray them as strange specimens of humanity
or as normal human beings who want to enjoy life? Is
the publicity dignified or is it oversentimental? Does it
hold the old folks up to ridicule under the disguise of
humor or pretended surprise that they should like certain
kinds of activities?

The aims of your program for older people should in-
clude these things:

(a) To increase their feelings of security.

(b) To expose them to interesting and stimulating ex-
periences, including education.

(0) To provide them with Opportunities for making new
friends. !

(d) To provide them with situations that relieve their
feelings of frustration and uselessness.

(e) To develop their recreational resources so that, in
addition to enjoying the present, they will have something
in the event they become more. physically handicapped.

(f) To convince them that joy and old age can go to-
gether.

BECREATION--

for Everyone

Houstonians have had much to keep
them busy recently. In addition to the

daily responsibilities of job and home,
they have been hard at work building
a metrOpolitan community—one which
will keep pace with the living needs of
a rapidly increasing population. In
1940 Ilouston counted some 384,000
residents and covered 73 square miles.
In 1950 the count was almost 600,000
pc0plc in a city enlarged to some 160
square miles. On January 1 of this
year, the estimated population was
640,000—representing an average pop-
ulation increase of more than 2,000 per
month.

Our problems are much the same as
those of any other city except for one
difference——wc cannot keep up with
our growth. We are paving streets,
laying sewers, installing traffic signals,
enlarging our police force, establishing
new fire stations, building new schools
(and erecting portable rooms next to
them before the grass has had a chance
to get started), urging the purchase of
sites for neighborhood parks, worrying
about bayou pollution, educating for

An interesting example of how to arouse

citizen support of a community program

health, trying to get a juvenile court,
and so on and on.

Our community council, charged
with the responsibility of planning
community services for health, welfare
and recreation, has accepted the chal-
lengc. In its short history of ten years
it has capitalized on the enthusiasm of
a new town, stimulated the imagination
of its residents to make their commu-
nity a better place in which to live,
channeled the many interests and
helped create plans for prOper welfare
deveIOpment. These plans are called
“blueprints.” One of these is “Recrea-
tion for Everyone, a Citizen Created
Recreation Development Plan for Met-
ropolitan Houston."

Citizen interest in community recrea-
tion is riding high in Houston, Texas.
The reasons are many and varied. To
some people it’s a matter of civic pride
to have the most and best of everything
-—rccreation included. Others think of
recreation as a way to prevent delin-
queney. Still others just want a place
to send their youngsters, take their
families, or to go themselves for a good
time. Essentially, all want to make
llouston a better place in which to live.
These diverse though related interests
joined forces in the recreation develop-
ment project of the community council

to improve community recreation.

Three basic steps must be taken in
any successful planning job. First
come the facts, then a plan is created
based on those facts, and on the ex-
pressed needs. And third, the plan
must be sold to the community if the
results are to be accomplished.

Our recreation development project
followed that pattern. Back in May of
1948 a fact-hnding committee was ap-
pointed in the rccrcation-infonnal
education section of the connINnity
council. It made an inventory of our
recreation programs and facilities and
summarized the essential population
data. The council’s research bureau
did the job as defined by the commit-
tee. About a year later the material
collected was published under the title,
Recreation Facilities and Resources in
Houston 1948-49. Information was
organized according to nineteen city
areas.

The second phase of our planning
then started. In September 1949, a
steering committee was appointed to
create a recreation development plan
for the whole city. The job was big—
too big for any one committee. It was
decided to divide the work and get
each neighborhood to take stock of its
own recreation and make recommenda-

Hanan-rim:

tions for improvement. Committee
members went out to enlist the help of
neighborhood leaders. Recreation was
discussed over the clatter of factory
machines, in the comfort of a living
room, amid the books and files of a
lawyer’s office, alongside a busy gaso-
line pump, in the quiet of a pastor’s
study, and in many other places.

Twelve recreation planning districts
were designated, and the neighborhood
leaders, with the help of agency staff
workers, recruited additional neighbor-
hood pe0ple to help get the job done.
It was not long before more than four
hundred persons were busy making
plans for recreation through the
twelve district committees.

This community-wide planning job
was officially launched with an all-
afternoon workshOp program on mini-
mum standards for community recrea-
tion. The five discussion groups had
over two hundred interested particip-
ants and professional leaders. They
tried to answer the questions of what
kind and how much recreation should
be the minimum for any neighborhood.
We discovered that established and
accepted standards have not been fully
deve10ped. Our conclusions were,
therefore, limited and tentative, but
nevertheless, they were put to good use
by the twelve district committees as
they undertook their assignments.

Public understanding of the entire
project was essential from the start.
NewSpapers carried stories of the plan-
ning job under way with maps showing
district boundaries. Speakers told the
story to civic and service clubs, church
groups, and other organizations. Bro-
chures explaining the project were
distributed widely.

In June of 1950 the twelve district
reports were presented during three
days of public meetings called by the
steering committee. The press covered
those hearings and carried daily sum-
maries of the rccommcndations made.
During the summer months, the steer-
ing committec carcfully studied the dis-
trict reports and summarized the major
recommendations. These dealt with
improvements in tax-supported recrea-
tion, use of schools for recreation,
nceded expansions in voluntary-sup-
ported recreation and further deve10p-
ment of the cultural services. The first

FEBRUARY 1953

draft of the final report was approved
by the community council in October
of 1950.

By that time, the third phase of our
planning job was well under way.
Gathering facts and creating a plan
were not enough, for the plans had to
be sold to the entire community. The
Community Chest appr0priated $3,500
to publish the final report, prepare
pamphlets, and produce a local sound
and color film on recreation. (See May
1952, RECREATION, page 96.—Ed.}
These tools were designed to bring the
story of recreation development to all
groups in our community. By Novem-
ber of 1951, a sixty-page report, with
maps, was published; and a thirteen-
minute sound and color film was pro-
duced. Since then, we have been busy
selling our product.

Our report contained two major
recommendations: first, school facilities
should be used in deve10ping commu-
nity recreation; second, the city should
be divided into twenty recreation

service districts, each with a council of
neighborhood residents and agency
representatives to plan, coordinate and
deve10p recreation on a neighborhood
basis.

 

The second section of the report
deals with deve10pment plans for public
recreation. According to National Rec-
reation Association standards, Houston
has only fifty-four per cent of the park
acreage suggested, and Operates its
recreation department at twenty per
cent of the $2.25 per capita budget
considered standard. The report makes
major rccommendations for the im-
provement of these and other defi-
ciencies.

Voluntary agency plans for expan-
sion are discussed in the third section
of the report. Standards are not
strictly defined, but a number of
general recommendations are made, in-

cluding further decentralization, more.

community sUpport, emphasis on pro-

grams for small groups and clubs,
aggressive recruiting and training of
volunteers, and closer working relation-
ships with service and civic clubs
sponsoring recreation projects.

Cultural services are featured in the
fourth section. General recommenda-
tions for these services were: more
publicity about the services now avail-
able; better maintenance of certain
facilities, including the increasing of
staff; extension of service to neighbor-
hoods; and more financial support
from both voluntary and tax sources.

The final section of the report is
designed to focus the recommendations
of the entire report on each neighbor-
hood. It identifies and describes the
twenty recreation service districts,
along with appr0priate maps, charts
and data. This basic information will
be the starting point for the continuous
planning to follow as district recreation
councils are organized.

We have officially presented the re-
port and movie before the city council,
the board of education, and the county
commissioners. Before these groups we
emphasized those portions of the re-
port coming under their own jurisdic-
tion. Plans are under way for a
similar hearing with the United Fund
Board.

Our speakers have so far met with
more than fifty organizations, with
attendance totaling several thousand
persons. We have shown the movie,
given the highlights of the total report,
discussed the recreation needs of in-
dividual neighborhoods and urged all
to work with their neighbors to see
that the job of recreation deve10pment
gets done.

Our whole planning project is based
on neighborhood interest and support.
The plan was created in the neighbor-
hoods and the real strength for success-
ful accomplishment remains therein.

You may say, “So far your story
sounds good. But what happens now?
How can you be sure that the recom-
mendations will get favorable action?”
We cannot be sure, but we have sub-
stantial reasons for confidence. Here’s
what has happened thus far:

1. One of our original district chair-
men ran for the city council last year
and injected recreation into the cam-
paign. 'Other..candidates followed suit,

525

and for the first time in history, recrea-
tion became a campaign issue. He and
some other recreation-minded men were
elected, and we feel that a favorable
situation has been created for major
improvements in city-supported rec-
rcation. We gave very careful study
to the 1952 budget allocations to city
departments to see that recreation and
libraries receive equal consideration
with other city services. The mayor
and city council have now approved the
1952 city operating budget. It includes
about $262,000 more for parks and
recreation than was spent in 1951.
This is an increase of thirty-nine per
cent—substantially higher than for any
other city department. An additional
$45,000 for the public library was also
approved. Public hcarings on the city
budget were set for the middle of
March. We were on hand with a dclc-
gation to support the recreation budget
as proposed and to get the additional
funds for the library included.

2. The use of schools for recreation
was one of our major recommenda-

tions. Last Spring, during the school
board election, this became one of the
campaign issues. As a result of our
formal hearing on this subject with
the board of education, they agreed to
appoint representatives from the schools
to sit down with representatives of the
city and the community council to pre-
pare a workable plan.

3. Interest and support for this entire
project resulted in $1,000,000 in bonds
for recreation, libraries being included
at the last minute, in last year’s 530,-
000,000 city bond issue. Both passed
with substantial majorities.

4. The project played a part in the
Chest campaign in the fall of 1950 and
in the successful Unitcd Fund drive in
the fall of 1951. Many who served on
district recreation planning committees
were new to the field of organized
wclfare. They learned many things
about their community. Some of the
improvements they wanted for their
neighborhoods meant increased budgets
for the voluntary agencies. Chest and
United Fund campaigns took on a new

meaning, and many worked hard to
make them successful.

In summary, the major character-
istics of this planning project are:

1. It is a self-study by lay and pro-
fessional recreation leaders of our own
community. Outside consultants were
used at certain points, but the recom-
mendations are our own.

2. “'e followed the three basic steps
in community planning—facts, plans
and promotion.

3. We are capitalizing on neighbor-
hood interest and support through all
phases of the project.

4. We are placing as much emphasis
on the sale of the product as in its
creation.

5. We have set up the necessary ma-
chinery through our community coun-
cil to see that the job gets done.

The community council has pro-
vided the vehicle through which the
citizens of Houston have done this job.
Ultimate success is assured, because
this has been and will continue to be a
cooperative community project.

 

Court Petition Dismissed

0 Recently a petition was brought into
court, by the School District of the
borough of Columbia, Lancaster Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, for leave to sell real
estate conveyed to it by David L. Clat-
feltcr and Anna Clatfcltcr, in a deed
providing that the land be henceforth
held and supervised for the lasting
benefit and happiness of the youth of
the community. Exceptions to the pro-
posed sale were filed by seven taxpay-
ers, their reasons contending: (1) the
pr0poscd sale will be a detriment and
injury to the youth of the community
in that it will reduce the athletic and
recreational facilities presently avail-
able to them without providing any
adequate and substantial substitute
therefor; (2) the trustee's opinion that
it is urgently necessary to sell the real
estate to prevent a failure of the trust
is without support that thc prOposcd
sale will in any manner remedy the al-
leged lack of funds for maintenance,
upkeep or repair of the facilities; and

526

(3) the proposed sale cannot be made
without injury or prejudice to the
trust.

Reduced to their essentials, thc rea-
sons for approval advanced by the trus-
tec were that: (1) the land in question
is not needed for the purposes of the
trust; (2) in .its capacity as trustee,
the School District has no funds for
the maintenance of the athletic field;
and (3) the proceeds of thc salc are
needed for the repairs set forth in the
petition, or for the production of in-
come for maintenance.

In this connection C. Leslie Lynch,
a recreation planner of the National
Recreation Association, was called by
cxccptants. He testified that the mini-
mum standards establishcd by the
National liccrcation Association are at
least one acre of playground and one
acre of playficld for each eight hundred
of population, and that the generally
accepted standard for all rccrcation.
including parks, is ten acres for each

one thousand of population. He testi-
fied that on March 28, 1952, he made
a recreation survey of Columbia. He
concluded that Columbia (having a
population of approximately twclvc
thousand) should have a minimum of
three playground areas and one play-
ficld comprising at least a total of
thirty acres. The court record states,
“While these standards doubtless rc-
present the ideal of what recreational
areas should be, it would seem that as
to any given community there are
present factors which make the ideal
impossible of attainment . . . . But by
any standard, we conclude from the
testimony that the development of
recreational areas in Columbia has not
reached the point when it can be said
that a reduction in the size of such
areas is advisable. Specifically, here,
the proportion proposed to be sold is
approximately one-fifth of the total

area . . . ”

The court found for reasons set forth
that “the proposed sale would not be
to the best interests and advantage of
the trust and all those interested
therein.” The petition was accordingly
dismissed.

VOCIIESTRA is exactly what the term

implies, a combined chorus and or-
chestra. The word, which has a War-
ing background, was used originally to
mean a chorus humming with the or-
chestra. It has been adopted in Au-
burn, New York, to cover the whole
musical organization, including male
and female voices, strings, wood-winds,
percussion, and brass sections of the
orchestra.

In 1942, when the war was begin-
ning to have its first effects on civilian
life, and Auburnians were casting
about for “gasless” amusements, the
superintendent of recreation, Joseph
Huther, who is now the Vochestra’s
business manager, organized a glee
club of male voices which met weekly
at the local YMCA. Specializing in
watered-down Waring, the men sang
more for their own amusement than
with any idea of acquiring professional
skill. To their director, perfectionist
Harold Henderson, such a situation
was anathema. The original forty or
fifty members were weeded out until
twcnty-four remained. Six carefully
sclected girl voices were added in a
cluster about the mike to give the nec-
cssary overtonc. Now Fred Waring
arrangements could be attacked with
justice.

Meanwhile, fatc and Mr. Henderson
were preparing to blend in a bit of
orchestral background for the finish-
ing touch. For many years Auburn
had enjoyed the offerings of an 0r-
chestral Society whose members stuck
to a rather formal and classical pro-
gram. The draft board skillfully re-

moved the backbone of this group, and
those who remained, plus a few mu-
sicians recruited from Auburn’s vicin-
ity, were invited to join the chorus.
The Vochestra was born.

Popular reaction to the new organi-
zation was spontaneous and enthusias-
tic beyond the wildest dreams of its
members. On their first concert these
musicians and singers drew a capacity
crowd to the local high school. So
great was the demand for tickets that
a repeat concert was given. Again the
Vochestra played to a standing-room-
only audience. A precedent was es-
tablished that has never been broken.
The Vochestra has never in its four-
year history given a performance that
was not a sell-out. By presenting a
program that is a combination of
classic and popular melodies, an ap-
peal is made to all types of music
lovers. It has been the philos0phy of
Vochestra, however, as Mr. Henderson
puts it, “To appeal to the masses rather
than to the symphonic few.”

If the Vocllestra sends its audience
away humming the tunes they have
heard, the performers are satisfied.

The Vochestra is still made up of a
mixed group of non-professionals who
sing and play for thc fun of it. As
all of these peOple have regular day-
time jobs, their practice schedule has
to be sandwiched into evenings and
weekends. Yet, according to the di-
rector, attendance is excellent, with a
waiting list for every section of the
chorus. The usual procedure is to re-
hearse the vocal section on Mondays
and the orchestra on Tuesday nights.
About a month before each concert

the two sections begin rehearsing to-
gether. “At least once before every

concert I blow up,” the director con-
fides, admitting that his musicians are
usually good sports about their scold-
ings. By doing many of the arrange-
ments himself, Mr. Henderson is able
to bring out the special talents of each
member, at the same time building up
a music library for future perform-
ances.

The sight of this unusual organiza-
tion as the curtain goes up always
leaves the audiences slightly breath-
less. All the members are seated in
tier effect, with the orchestra on the
right and chorus on the left side. Vis-
ability is perfect; no one has to crane
his neck to see a relative or favorite
performer in the back row. Orchestra
and male choristers are dressed in
white jackets and black skirts or
trousers. The women singers, among
whom are a mother and daughter
team, are a complete contrast in filmy
gowns ranging from pastels to deep
purples. The setting blends with the
occasion. At the last Christmas con-
cert, for instance, a black curtain was
used as a backdrop, with mu‘lti-colored
sequin snow flakes in front, suspended
from the ceiling, to throw dancing
lights. When the footlights went out
as the choir sang Christmas carols, the
effects were unforgettable.

Stage setting is only a minor part
of the performance, however. The big-
gest miracle of showmanship is the
way in which the audience is put com-
pletely at ease before the end of the
first number. As no printed programs
are used, each listener must take his
cue from the introductions given to the
songs by Director Henderson. -He
manages to have a style of his own,
an infectious enthusiasm that is

59.7

caught by players and listeners as the
evening progresses.

DeSpite the full-time jobs held by
all members of the Vochestra they
manage to find time for a rigorous
concert schedule. The 1951-52 pro-
gram included concerts in Auburn,
Port Byron, Sampson Naval Air Base,
Cornell University, Oneida, and Cort-
land. Altogether ten concerts were
given. Probably the highlight of the
season was the performance for the air
. force at Sampson. As the cadets were
being shepherded into their seats by
their officers, one of the big brass
moaned to Harold Henderson, “It’s a
shame you’re having an intermission.
The boys will probably get outside and
forget to come back.” It seems this
had happened the week before when a

A recent project of the “Three

ginia, was a hobby and craft show that
was “different.” Plans for the display
of "old" articles sent members scurry-
ing to attic trunks to dig for treasure.
Excellent exhibit space was made pos-
sible and exciting, by the donation of
a store window for this purpose by one
of the largest local department stores.
Another merchant gave two tr0phies to
be awarded for the oldest articles actu-
ally made by club members.

big name band had been on stage. But
contrary to expectations the boys went
out and spread the word to the rest
of the camp. When the Vochestra be-
gan the second half of its program,
cadets were standing in the aisles.

As an example of a community-par-
ticipated and community-sponsored
recreational activity, the Vochestra has
been an invaluable asset to Auburn
and its vicinity. Strictly a non-profit
organization, the band and chorus give
one concert a year, at Christmas, to
pay the year’s eXpenses. Other con-
eerts are presented for some civic en-
terprise or charity and are usually
sponsored by service clubs like Ki-
wanis, Lions or Rotary clubs. These
clubs have made several thousands of
dollars for Auburn charities with the

mother in 1891, and an album of old
postal cards started in 1891. Other
articles 011 exhibit were a figurine from
the Campbell falnily, brought to this
country two hundred years ago, a
Stradivarius two hundred and eighty
years old, and another violin made by
Itubes of Germany. There was also: a
bathing suit, made on a spinning wheel
and dyed with walnut stain in 1868;
many crocheted bed spreads, table cov-
ers, scarves; old guns, one of which
was used in 1812, and one patented in
1858: and valentines sent to the owner
in 1883.

The club, for men and woan of
sixty-five years and over, was organ-
ized in 1935 by Mr. S. M. Smith, a re-

Vochestra’s help—not to mention other
thousands made outside the city.
Money isn’t everything, though. The
pleasure given to music lovers of all
types, as well as the civic pride engen-
dered by the Vochestra can’t be mea-
sured in dollars and cents. The idea
seems to be Spreading, too. Several
communities in the country have writ-
ten Mr. Henderson expressing a desire
to organize similar groups. Fred War-
ing probably paraphrased this interest
best in a letter to Harold Henderson:
“Since music is a universal language
not restricted to any race, creed, or
profession it’s always gratifying to see
a group of music lovers coming from

A GREAT
AMERICAN
' TEAM

Abrief dictionary definition of the word cooperation is
“work or act together;” but in Jacksonville, Florida, the
definition should read, “work, act or play together.” Here
the spirit of cooperation between the recreation depart-
ment and all branches of the navy within and adjacent to
the city limits is cordial and beneficial to all parties.

The city’s department works, acts and plays harmoni-
ously with the Navy Recruiting Station in the Federal
Building, the Naval Reserve Training Center located in the
Armory on the St. John’s River, the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, Cecil Field Naval Air Station at Mayport, Flor-
ida, Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Green Cove Springs
Naval Station, Inactive Fleet at Green Cove Springs and
navy ships of all types that dock in the St. John’s River.
It also can be truthfully said that, insofar as recreation is
concerned, the city of Jacksonville does not make a dis-
tinction between navy personnel and civilians.

Day after day, navy men and women are seen using the
many facilities and areas supervised by the Jacksonville
recreation department and engaging in all types of activi-
ties promoted by the department.

A resume of the department’s softball and baseball pro-
gram, during the recently concluded 1952 season, illustrates
this spirit of cooperation. The department sponsored ten
major softball leagues and one major baseball league.
Nine navy teams participated in the softball competition
and two navy clubs were members of the baseball league.

Among the nine navy softball teams were three champi-
onship outfits. Cecil Field triumphed in the Men’s City
League, Naval Reserve scored in the Independent League

was victorious in the Metropolitan League. Jacksonville
Naval Air Station copped the pennant in the City Baseball
League.

A neat bit of cooperation was worked out in the City
Baseball League, loop games being played on one of the
city’s diamonds and on the fields at Cecil Field and Jack-
sonville Naval Air Station. All of the softball play was on
city owned areas.

Navy teams were also prominent in the Florida Amateur
Softball Association Second District Tournament and the
Duval County Softball Tournament. Cecil Field added the
county title to its City League championship.

The fall season included three navy teams in the Men’s
City Volleyball League, and one Wave team in the Girls’
City Volleyball League, which had just been organized by
the municipal recreation department.

Also during this past summer, a well balanced team from
Jacksonville Naval Air Station was crowned champion of
the annual City Swimming and Diving Championships
sponsored and conducted by the Jacksonville recreation
department. At this same meet, a group of bluejackets
from Jacksonville Naval Air Station stole the hearts of the
capacity audience with a great exhibition of comic diving.

During the past several months, two athletes from Jack-
sonville Naval Air Station, Leon Wilson, ADC, and Ben
Sobieraj, AN, have played prominent roles in tennis tour-
naments sponsored and conducted by the recreation de-
partment. Early in the summer, Sobieraj won the men’s
singles title in the Duval County Tennis Championships,
and in September he went to the finals in the men’s singles
division of the City Tennis Championships and teamed

with Wilson to gain the men’s doubles diadem.

The Jacksonville Golden Gloves Boxing Tournament,
staged in the Gator Bowl last winter, was practically an
all-service event, particularly in the open division. In this
part of the meet, Jacksonville Naval Air Station had three
champions and two runners-up. Green Cove Springs Sta-
tion had one champion and three runners-up. The long
entry list from the navy installations was mainly respon-
sible for the recreation department’s permitting white and
Negro fighters to meet in the same ring for the first time
in Jacksonville history.

To be frank, had it not been for the navy and other
service entries, it would have been impossible for the local
recreation department to have had a worthwhile open divi-
° sion and to send a representative team to the Golden Gloves

Championships in New York City.

Navy personnel quite frequently make up a large portlon
of the crowds attending recreation department sponsored
events, particularly those of a sports nature. At most of
the activities sponsored by the recreation department, navy
spectators are admitted free; this includes admission to all
of the major softball and baseball games, tennis tourna-
ments, swim meets and track meets.

With thousands of young men and women wearing navy
uniforms stationed in and around Jacksonville community,
sports are greatly influenced by navy athletes.

The fine cooperation exhibited between the Jacksonville
recreation department and Jacksonville Naval Air Station
is exemplified in the annual Baseball Training Camp for
Boys. Each spring this event attracts hundreds of teen-age
boys, the camp being held at the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, with Mason Baseball Field serving as the hub of
activity. The Naval Air Station supplies the field, neces-
sary equipment such as ball and bats, plans and conducts
the program, furnishes the biggest part of the coaching
staff and arranges transportation to and from the station.
The recreation department’s major part in the program is
to sign up the boys for the school on the public play-
grounds.

The recreation department and the various branches of
the navy in and outside the city, also pull together in
many activities other than sports. Several wearers of Uncle
Sam’s blues, both men and women, are members of the
Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra which is sponsored by
the department.

One of the civic duties assumed by members of the activi-
ties staff of the department is the task of conducting pa-
rades of diversified natures. No parade is complete with-
out a navy color guard, and officials of the recreation de-
partment are always assured of full c00peration from the
Navy Recruiting Station across the street in the Federal
Building. This color guard also ofliciatcs at big football
games such as the annual Gator Bowl football classic.

Mechanically inclined sailors oftimes pursue their hob-
bies by joining with civilian members in the activities of
the Jacksonville Model Airplane Club and the Jacksonville
Miniature Auto Racing Association, both affiliated with the
Jacksonville recreation departmcnt.

Navy personnel and members of their families belong to
the dcpartrncnt’s Hobby Club, and obtain non-mechanical
handicraft instruction in the classes held at its handicraft
center, llobbyland.

Children of navy families participate in the city’s recrea-
tion activities in many ways. They enroll in tennis clinics,
participate in midget and junior swim meets, softball, base
hall, basketball, and touch football leagues, junior tennis
tournaments and clubs, model airplane clubs and meets,
special programs such as the annual observance of Joseph
Lee Day, kite tournaments and all of the other events of the
well rounded program conducted by the departmcnt. Navy
children may be found every day playing on all twenty-five
of the supervised playgrounds.

The Jacksonville 'recrcation department and the navy are
one for all and all for one—a great American team!

NOteS for the Administrator

Goals for the Modern City

At the 1951 National Conference on Government, Mr.
Henry Bruere, currently president of the National Mu-
nicipal League, made an address entitled “Goals for the
Modern City,” according to an article in the National
Municipal Review. A number of his statements are of
vital interest to the recreation field:

“The great American need is for intelligence, courage
and care in developing practical but bold programs for
the betterment of municipal conditions. We have raised
our standards of living and our expectations from life
but we have not put our minds to designing and manag-
ing our communities so as to help us fulfill these expec-
tations.

“During the past two decades in England, government
officials, guided by special commissions and expert stud-
ies, have had the courage to look at the problem of re-
modeling the out-moded city not as a hopeless set of in-
surmountable difficulties but as an urgent task, prerequi-
site to healthy and, I may add with underscoring, plea-
sant living. I have recently had an opportunity to study
these plans and the resultant programs and I found them
eminently worth while for Americans to examine. To
those Britishers who have taken a long and critical look
at their country’s urban conditions, it is obvious that
modern traffic must be provided for, that recreation is
essential to well-being, that access to the countryside is,
for a Britisher at least, a fundamental need, that decent
housing, attractive schools, playfields, transportation, easy
access to work, are all indispensable to what we call the
American, and they the British, way of life.”

In commenting on developments in Great Britain he
stated, “What I found most significant was the purpose to
deal with housing and other urban redevelopment as a
project in building pleasant livable communities with an
adequate supply of what the British call the amenities.
They have taken a good long look at their cities and have
decided to change things for the better.”

“I come back to my original point. The essential thing
about the city is its character—how people live in it, how
they work in it and how they can bring up their children
in it. The city should not be centrifugal, scattering its
peOple over long stretches of suburban territory. It should
be livable and controlled in the interest of good living.
How to do this? I do not know but 1 stand on the propo-
sition that a way will be found if there is adequate study

given to the matter.” .

Department Adopts Policy on Personal Expenses

The board of directors of the Chambersburg, Pennsyl-
vania, recreation department has authorized that the su-
perintendent of recreation be reimbursed for personal ex-
penditures incurred in connection with his official duties,
and an item of four hundred dollars was approved in the
department’s budget for 1952. Expenses for the use of
the superintendent’s private car and for meals and lodging
while on official business are accepted as personal expenses
and are subject to reimbursement. thcial business is de-
fined as any and all business expected of the superintendent
while discharging the duties of his office, or representing
the department of recreation, or accepting an invitation
to appear on conference programs—previously approved
by the board of directors of the department. The scale of
reimbursement is as follows:

1. Use of private automobile—$.08 per mile.

2. Meals—$.75 for breakfast maximum; $1.25 for lunch
maximum; $1.75 for dinner maximum.

3. Lodging—$4.50 per night maximum.

4. Gratuities—not to exceed ten per cent of lodging or
meals expenses.

5. Miscellaneous—not to exceed $1.00 per day, provided
the expense report carries an itemized list of miscellaneous
expenses.

A monthly form for recording expenses has been ap-
proved and is submitted at the end of each month by the
superintendent. The need for incurring expenses for meals
and lodging must appear on an accompanying page, and
receipted bills for lodging must accompany the report. The
superintendent must seek, in advance, approval from the
board of directors for any expenses anticipated while ab-
sent from his office for two working days or more.

Rest Rooms with Pay Toilets

The department of recreation and parks of Los A11-
geles has entered into a contract with a company for the
installation of coin locks on part of the doors in rest rooms
at certain facilities. The person in charge of the facility
is responsible for the collection of the money and for
turning it in to the department cashier. Special report
forms are submitted in duplicate each week, and on the
last day of each month, by the company making the in-
stallation. After the cost of installing the doors has been
collected, the money is to be divided on a seventy-thirty
basis. The seventy per cent will be the department’s share
and the thirty per cerit is paid to the company.

PRACTICAL MUSIC

Practical music is not as cold and unimaginative as it

sounds. Some of the greatest musicians of the past were
practical musicians. Bach wrote his great organ music as
practical music. It was the style of his day to write fugues,
so he gave his listeners what they wanted. Mozart wrote
operas for the theater on. order. These operas played hun-
dreds of performances before their runs were over. Haydn
wrote his one hundred and four symphonies for the salary
he received from his royal sponsor. Verdi wrote for the
theater of his day as a practical composer. His great opera
Aida was written to order for an agreed upon amount of
money. We could go on indefinitely citing examples of
great composers who worked within a practical frame but
who composed beautiful music even though restricted to a
set formula.

To me, “practical music” is music which fills a definite
need. Impraetical music is music for which there is no
general craving or need.

Music is an exact science. Mathematics play a very de-
eisive role in its creation as well as its performance. How-
ever, the fugitive character of a performance adds an ele-
ment which does not exist in most other art forms. This
characteristic has proven to be an economic handicap in
some cases and a benefit in others. A performer can sing
or play the same material again and again and reap rich
rewards if his performance pleases his audiences. Although
recording devices have captured a part of this elusive char-

The Doctor’s Orchestral Soelety of New York is an example
of practical musie in that it fills a need. L. to r.: Doctors

aeteristic, they can never equal the “live” performance.
This is owing to the fact, first, that no mechanical device
has yet been discovered which is as sensitive as the human
ear, and, secondly, the visual stimulus or personality of the
performer cannot be captured.

Once in a generation the world produces a Haydn, a
Mozart, a Beethoven, a Liszt, a Berlioz, a Wagner, a
Brahms, a Joachim, a Kreisler, a Heifetz. Out of all the
millions of Occidentals of the past generation, one great
conductor emerged—Arturo Toscanini. In the generation
before him came Weingartner, before him Richter, before
him Von Bulow, and of course Wagner. Great singers are
more plentiful. Usually they are not profound musicians
and in some cases are deplorahly ignorant of the funda-
mentals of music.

With the odds so heavily against your community pro-
ducing a musician who will win world-wide acclaim, it
seems to me far better to try to cultivate a love for and
understanding of music than to try to find and train great
talents. By all means, do not stop looking for great talents
and training them if you find them, but do not be disap-
pointed if you do not find any.

I believe that the most practical way to serve the cause
of music is to make music. I mean ensemble playing—the
forming of groups who make music together because they
love music, or because they want to earn a livelihood.
These groups can be all professional. As I understand it,
the amateur musician is one who performs or composes
music for the pleasure he derives from his chorts. The pro-
fessional musician, while he may also derive pleasure from
labors, makes his living thereby. There is nothing wrong
in either case. In many instances, the so-ealled “amateur”
is more highly proficient than the professional.

I wish that there were more amateurs in musie because
it is the amateur who keeps the desire for better music
growing. The amateur can afford to be an idealist—while,
all too often, the professional cannot. The amateur musi-

cian is the only one who can enjoy “art for art’s sake”—
such a thing does not exist in professional music.

Community Orchestras

In smaller towns and cities I believe that the professional
musician does not have a very easy time of it. He loves
music and enjoys making it. However, his economic situa-
tion does not allow him to devote his entire time to it.
Consequently, he has to find other employment to provide
the major portion of his income. This condition does not
allow him to practice sufficiently and he can seldom pro-
gress much further than his initial talent. However, when
a group of these men and women get together and form a
symphony orchestra, it is not only commendable but de-
serves the greatest possible support of the local community.
The music they make may not be as beautiful as that made
by a great symphony orchestra of one of our large cities,
but that is of little consequence. The important fact is that
they have organized an orchestra and play symphonic mu-
sic. If you try to organize an orchestra, do not be dis-
couraged if it is difficult. It does not matter if you have
only two horns instead of four, or if you have no basses at
all. You can procure reduced orchestrations where the
piano fills in for the missing parts. Use four pianos if you
want to. Every publishing house sells such orchestrations
for very moderate prices. These orchestrations are another
example of practical music. Do not be discouraged.

The professional musicians in our largest cities are the
most proficient in the world. This applies principally to
New York and Hollywood because those two cities are
where the most money can be made. In Hollywood, it is
the moving picture industry. In New York, it is radio,
opera, symphony, motion pictures and now television.
Sooner or later, nearly every professional musician in the
smaller communities tries out one of the large cities. If he

succeeds in, let us say, Cleveland, he may then try New
York. And here is where he finds real competition. The

FEBRUARY 1953

New York union, Local 802, has some twenty thousand
members—of these, only about four or five thousand are
employed more or less regularly.

Sooner or later the local orchestra which you have or-
ganized will progress to the point where you will need out-
side players to satisfy the demands of your audiences.
Then is when you come to New York to get your players.
New York contains a reservoir of players which supplies
practically every major symphony Orchestra with some of
its finest players. Before I became the conductor of the
Firestone orchestra, I travelled all over this country and
Canada as guest conductor for the major symphonies. In
nearly every city I would meet one or more players whom

I had known in New York.
Subsidies

As your local orchestra grows and raises its standard of
performance, you will find that you need more money to
keep yourselves going. Everything costs money—programs,
rehearsal halls, performance halls, advertising, soloists.
Here is where the insidious and sinister word “subsidy”
comes in. Subsidy is dangerous because it tends to pauper-
ize the recipients and give the control of the organization
to the subsidisor. If your benefactor is a wise and under-
standing person who loves music and is willing to help
you. without interfering with the artistic side of the orches- ‘
tra, you are very fortunate. Such a benefactor is difficult
to find. Before you accept a subsidy, I would exhaust
every other possible source of income.

In Buffalo, New York, the orchestra plays Saturday
night “pop” concerts. At these concerts, the audience is
served light drinks and the orchestra plays for dancing
after the concert. They make money this way to help pay
for the more serious concerts of the symphony series. Play
whenever and wherever you can for a profit if you need to

533

finance a deficit on your more serious series. If you find
that your original and local conductor is not adequate to
your growing needs, go to one of our great conservatories
and take a young man of talent who is willing to come to
your city and become a part of the community. Do not
take a man who thinks he is ready to conduct the New
York Philharmonic—whose ideas are too big for his capa-
bilities. Take one who is willing to accept the challenge
of making a success of a small town orchestra.

To go back to the subject of subsidy again. If you can-
not find a way of making your orchestra self-supporting
and are forced to accept a subsidy, try to get a large num-
ber of small donations instead of one or two large ones.
Keep the costs of your performances down. Use local solo-
ists as much as you can until they cease to draw houses
for you. When you are forced to use so-called “name solo-
ists,” buy names who will draw their fee at the box office.
One of my best friends in the concert business had a hard
and fast rule. If, when he sang a concert on a fee basis, he
did not draw his fee at the box ofiice, he returned his cheek
to the local manager who would otherwise have lost money
on his concert. You can understand why this singer was
always in demand until the day he retired. There are still
a few such soloists around.

With radio and television bringing fine artists into your
living room each week, on can easily choose your artists
yourselves. Extravagant claims of managers and paid ad-
vertising should no longer sway you. You can now hold
your auditions in your own living room.

Critics

Now a word about the critical profession and your local
newspaper. Anyone who embarks on a performing career
must face the possibility of adverse criticism. He must be
prepared to go right ahead regardless of what the press
may say about his performance. You must remember that
your press criticisms reflect the opinion of only one person
in the audience. The fact that he has the power to print
what he thinks is beyond your control. I cannot under-
stand the process of thinking of a person who makes his

living by writing about music in a community, and then,
by criticisms, kills the music he is writing about. Enlist
your local scribe in your project. Engage him to write
your program notes—elect the editor of your local paper to
your executive board. Make it one big “team for music."

The Composer

The most impractical of all musicians is the composer.
He has always been that way. I fear he will remain so.
A composer feeds upon his inner self. He is by nature sub-
jectivc. He does not know where his ideas come from.
The great majority of these people slave their lives away
writing music which will never be performed. This is
largely their own fault. To be a successful composer, you
must have a dual personality.

Only in the pepular field are the composers repaid for
their efforts. And, strangely enough, when “liomeo and
Juliet” by Tschaikowsky becomes “Our Love” in the popu-
lar field, “Romeo and Juliet” becomes a sell-out on ree-
ords. \Vhen the first movement of Tschaikowsky's piano
concerto became “Tonight We Love”—the concerto under-
went a new revival in concert popularity. The thievery of
ideas employed, unashamedly, by Tin Pan Alley composers
is breathtaking in its bold-faced knavery. I am speechless
when confronted by one of these burglars——and yet, it is a
blessing in disguise because I know that as soon as the
stolen property has become popular as a song, I can play
it in its original form as the thieves will have taught the
melody to the general public. Nothing can be done to stop
this. The copyright law says such a practice is not illegal.

I am told that the big name dance band business is con-
trolled by several agencies. Their method of operation is
quite simple. They find a nice looking boy playing in a
dance band and put him under contract at a figure which is
so much more than the amount he is earning as a player,
that he is glad to sign a long-term agreement. Then they
recruit for him a dance band of his own. They hire ar-
rangcrs, pick the tunes to be played. If the band catches
the public’s fancy another name band is launched but it is
very largely controlled by the agency.

Enlist the Support of “’omen

A full-page advertisement, recently sponsored by the Woman’s Home Com-
panion, referred to the women’s club program which the magazine had prepared
relating to the article entitled, “But Suppose She Falls!” This article, which
appeared in an early 1952 issue, attacked hoards of education for surfacing their
playgrounds with black-top. According to the advertisement, 276 women's clubs
have presented the surfacing program, and 89 clubs have voted to make safe
surfacing for playgrounds a club project.

The magazine undouhtedly performed a service in stimulating an interest on
the part of the women's organizations in the condition of their playgrounds.
Local recreation authorities may well take advantage of this interest in enlisting
support for a program of play ground improvements. It is unfortunate, how-
ever, that in the program material issued for use by the women’s cluhs. statistics
on school playground aecidents were included which indicate a much larger
volume of accidents than have been reported by the school authorities in the

cities cited in the program.

During his years as superintendent, Mr. Boughner, in-
augurated a wide variety of recreation facilities and activi-
ties in his community—activities for people of all ages,
all interests. He was instrumental in arranging community-
wide programs and musical organizations, supervised play-
grounds and playfields, classes in crafts, sports, drama and
dancing.

He was a member of the New England District Advisory
Committee of the National Recreation Association, presi-
dent of the Eastern Massachusetts Recreation Association,
member of the American Recreation Society, and of several
other professional groups.

The untimely passing of this young executive, who was
forty-eight years old, has caused great sorrow among his
multitude of friends.

t'tt TRIP to Japan was fabulous. We arrived on Sunday,

August 10, at five o'clock in the morning, and were

met at the airport by a delegation of important leaders.

His Royal Highness the Prince of Mikasa, the Emperor’s

youngest brother, drove fifty miles from his summer home

to greet us personally. A press conference at the Imperial
Hotel announced to the nation our recreation mission.

We left Tokyo the next morning and started on one of
the most strenuous and most rewarding assignments l
have ever undertaken. We spent thirty-nine days and
nights packed full of activities, in twenty-five prefectures
or states.

Before we left Tokyo, the Prince of Mikasa entertained
us at Korinka-Ku, the home of his elder brother, Prince
Takamatsu. In addition to the royal brothers and their
princesses, several Japanese cabinet members, our own
.-'\mbassadur Murphy and his family, representatives of
the Army, board members of the Japanese NRA, chief
executives of radio and press associations, and others were
among the guests to start off our recreation mission.

We were aceumpanied constantly by committees repre-
seeming;r the national association, and, in each state, by

representatives of the governor, the mayor, and various
ministries related to recreation.

The pattern generally was the same. Upon arrival in a
town, we were met by oiiicials, had press interviews, con-
ferred with selected groups of leaders, made one or more
public addresses, distributed literature, showed the motion
picture film, A Chance to Play, visited recreation facilities,
and had a series of individual conferences. This went on,
literally, throughout our stay in Japan.

While in Japan we gave considerable attention to the
problem of recreation for our military personnel on leave.
In addition to touring throughout Japan, we attended the
National Recreation Congress in Kumamoto. It was very
impressive, and showed a vitality and a purposefulness
that augurs well for recreation in Japan.

Sixteen hundred delegates from outside of the state
attended. Another 2,500 within Kumamoto and surrounding
cities made a total of about 4,000 participants. They had
general sessions, discussion meetings and exhibits; and
many of their t0pics were similar to ours. Square dancing
filled the roped-off streets and vacant lots in various parts
of Kumamoto. Speaking at a general session in a packed
auditorium, I extended the greetings of American recrea-
tion leaders, explained our own recreation movement fully,
its values and relationship to citizenship in. a democracy,
gave in detail the organization and services of our NRA,
and offered our cooperation and good will.

We awarded, in behalf of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation of the U. S. A., a special medal to the Prince of
Mikasa and to iifleen other Japanese leaders who had
helped in building the national recreation movement in
Japan. Those receiving the medals and citation were:

His Highness Prince of Mikasa Mr. Shinichi Sato

Mr. Soichi Saito Mr. Yoshiteru Shiratori
Mr. Shunzo Yoshisaka Mr. Genzaburo Shirayama
Mr. Yoshihiko Kurimoto Mr. Taisuke Nishida

Mr. Masayuke Asakura Mr. J inzahuro Fukuyama
Mr. Masazo Ikeda Mr. Tatsuro Misumi

Mr. Eiichi Isomura Mr. Akira Miyama

Mr. Kenkichi Oshima Mr. Tom Yanagita

On one side of this medallion appears in relief a group

grcat sculptors of youth. It is called The Joy of Effort.

The Japan recreation mission was an excellent
example of a cooperative approach to a fundamental
problem—leisure time and its constructive use. Pri-
vately supported agencies on both sides of the Pacijic
shared in the planning and execution, and are now
following-up the findings. This project had the ap-
proval of both the American and Japanese governments
though it was a non-governmental mission.

In preparation for our trip, the interest of organiza-
tions and individuals was enlisted in the project, their
cooperation and support secured, and funds raised to
finance America’s part of the project. In Japan, the
Japanese NRA planned and financed a aviation-wide
tour which made it possible to present our message of
good will and cooperation to the Japanese people.

 

It is symbolic of the joyous vitality of the recreation move-

ment, not only in its physical aspects, but in all of the

varied activities which make up the recreation program.
On the other side appears the following inscription:

For enriching the human spirit through recreation.
National Recreation Association, U.S.A.

With the medallion was presented a certiiicate, signed by
Otto T. Mallery, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and
Joseph Prendergast, Executive Director of the National
Recreation Association of America, which stated, in part:

“The National Recreation Association is proud of what
its services have meant to America, and believes that its
proper counterpart in other nations can contribute greatly
to the enrichment of life for their people. It is our hope
that this recognition of leaders in other lands, who share
our aspirations, may serve to bring about a closer fellow-
ship and an exchange of ways and means of enriching the
human spirit through recreation.

“We welcome the opportunity—within the limits of our
resources—to share with others our information and ex-
perience.”

In addition, we presented to the NRA of Japan a basic
library of our NRA literature and certain other publica-
tions characteristic of American life, presented a magniii-
cent exhibit of arts and crafts donated by the recreation
department of Portland, Oregon, and gave another showing
of the motion picture iilm, A Chance To Play.

On one of the days at the Congress there was a session
on international recreation. Colonel Caum, Colonel Ogden,
Colonel Davenport, Colonel Moore and several other men
and women representing the U. S. Army were on the plat-
form participating in the discussion with representatives
from Canada and China.

While at Kumamoto, Colonel Ogden, commander of
Camp Wood, located nearby, invited us and a group of
oilicials of the Japanese NRA to Camp Wood. Here we
discussed the desirability of the closer collaboration of
Army officials and Japanese leaders in providing recreation
for both the servicemen and the Japanese pe0ple. Colonel
and Mrs. Ogden showed us through the splendid recreation

facilities provided for our men inside the camp. We watched
a demonstration of games and sports by our soldiers and
Japanese eivilians—an example of the collaboration we
were discussing. Colonel Ogden is deeply concerned for
the welfare of the young men in his charge. He has made
Camp Wood a place of beauty; and those who return to it
from Korea come back to a bit of America tucked away in
the Japanese hills.

The Prince of Mikasa and his Princess attended the
Congress and took an active part in it. President Soichi
baito, board chairman Y. Kurimoto, C. Shirayania, T.
.‘lisulni, T. Yanagita and others gave outstanding leader-
ship to it.

On two of the days, the Congress broke up into groups
and visited nearby cities, industrial plants, fishing villages
and rural districts. The Prince and l barnstormed the
area in behalf of recreation, speaking both to groups of
leaders and to mass lneetings indoors and out. We also
worked together in this way at other times and in other
parts of Japan.

pressing economic, political and social problems, their
government completely reorganized, their way of life
radically changed, and their aeccptance baek into the family
of nations less than six months old when we were there.

Japan’s open-armed welcome to the recreation move-
ment is an outstanding example of how a tense world is
turning to reereation for relief.

At the meeting mentioned above it was generally agreed
that among the results could be listed these:

1. The eoncept of recreation in Japan has broadened.

2. Covermnent leaders on all levels have faeed recrea-
tion as one of the important national problems, and cdu-
eators and oflicials have given eonsideration to it.

3. Recreation in Japan has had a better and more wide-
spread coverage by press and radio than ever before.

4. A very eonsiderable interest in home and family play
was developed.

5. There was a general acceptance on the part of ollicials
of the importanec of leadership.

6. There was an aeceptance of the need for strengthen-
ing and expanding the National Recreation Association of
Japan as a service agency for local groups. It is now being
reorganized and plans laid for a larger financing.

7. There was a recognition by many leaders of the
necessity of ineluding girls and women more generally in
the reereation life of the people.

8. Attention was focused upon the problem of recreation
for our own American serviee personnel stationed in
Japan. We all know how acute is the problem of men in
the armed forces away from home, even in this country.
In the Far East it is much more serious. I found high
ranking officers of the Army and the Japanese leaders eon-
cerned about our men on leave from camp or from the
Korean front. We took time to have a series of conferences
with them, including Ccneral Harrold, Commander of
U. S. Forces in Japan.

These conferences culminated in a joint session in Tokyo
just bcfore we left, at which time a definite program was
sct up and plans made for an organization to bring about
a closer liaison between the Army and the Japanese, and
a more wholesome recreation program for our servicemen
and for the Japanese people. Sinee our rcturn to Ameriea,
lctters received from the Far East Command report steps
already taken to implcment the program.

9. One of the things that impressed us while in Japan,
and which has grown upon us since our return because of
comments and letters from lcaders in America and Japan.
is the fact that, in addition to the speeific scrviee to the
recreation movement, the mission had value in building
better international understanding. It can, and l believe
will, continue to have this cllect because:

a. We have gained a first-hand knowledge of Japan—nthe
country, the people, the customs, the spirit.

b. We have bronght back a fecling of admiration for the
progress which has been made in the post-war period in
industry. in local government, in education, in rebuilding
of cities. in recreation development, and in looking forward
rather than back.

e. We have experienced and know the extent of good

RECREATION

feeling that exists in Japan for America. Our trip was
filled with evidence of this.

The international understanding and closer relations
established through this bringing together of the recreation
forces of the tw0*countries have contributed to the total
effort of strengthening Japan for a place on the team of
free nations.

I am sure you will understand that in listing these things
and other evidences which I shall cite, we are talking not
in personal terms, but in terms of the recognition of the
project itself which was completely a cooperative effort
between America and Japan, and which was an expression
and extension of the services of the National Recreation
Association and of the whole American recreation move-
nient itself.

Some of the evidence upon which we base our conclu-
sions:

1. We had the status of “national guests” and received a
friendly reception everywhere we went.

2. Governors, mayors and legislative representatives
expressed to us personally the intention of giving more
time and money to recreation.

3. In Osaka we were awarded the silver medal given to
those who make a contribution to the Advancement of
Culture in Japan.

4. A series of lectures which we had prepared, plus cer-
tain other information about the recreation movement in
America, was published in a special booklet which is being
widely distributed in Japan.

5. Statements, letters from the Prince of Mikasa, officials
of the Japanese NRA and other leaders have expressed

cessful completion of their international recreation mission.

gratitude and appreciation for the progress made in the
public understanding of recreation. His Highness, in his
capacity as Honorary President of Japan’s NRA, made
two public statements about the recreation mission, one
in the form of a letter which he read at the Sayonam party
at the home of our host, T. Kato, the other at the gather-
ing of national leaders at Korinka-ku. The latter follows:

“After the war, interest in square dancing swept the
country. Some pe0ple in Japan thought recreation meant
only square dancing. Mr. Rivers has broadened our con-
cept of what recreation is and what it can mean to our
country. His visit has been especially helpful in getting
our governors, mayors and other officials to understand
recreation and its importance. His concrete help on our
specific recreation problems has been much appreciated.

“We have received much help from America. Since the
war we have had many visitors who have tried to help us.
In a few cases their plans appeared to be either too ideal-
istic or not applicable to the Japanese situation. They
were confusing rather than helpful in spite of good inten-
tions. However, those who were connected with recreation
have been helpful and constructive.

“Mr. Rivers’ analysis of our situation was clarifying and
his suggestions and advice have been very practical. Our
people are accepting them. Steps are being taken to carry
many of them out. The Rivers’ insight into Japanese psy-
chology, their friendliness and their frankness make us
feel grateful to them and closer to America. From our
point of view, their mission has been a complete success.
We appreciate all they have done.”

6. In Tokyo, just prior to leaving, a whole series of
farewell gatherings, luncheons and cocktail parties, was
held in our honor. Among them, a surprise square dance
party featuring 224 dancers, each chosen to represent
square dance societies, in the metr0politan area of Tokyo,
having a total membership of 500,000 people.

Included was a luncheon party given by Governor Yeasui
in Tokyo. The presidents and representatives of forty-
eight different recreation associations came togethcr to
greet us and bid us farewell.

I wish there were space to share with you some of the
conferences we had with certain individuals throughout
Japan and to describe some of our experiences in that pic-
turesque country. I remember the grand old man, Miki-
moto, the pearl king who is ninety-four years old, who sat
kimona-clad fanning himself and listened eagerly as I a11-
swered his question, “What are you doing in Japan?”
When I finished telling him he leaned forward, tapped me
on the knee with his fan and said, “Good, you should stay
here a year. Japan needs your message.”

I recall our several talks with Dr. Morito, former cabi-
nct minister, who helped to write the new constitution for
Japan and who now serves as president of Hiroshima Uni-
versity. He told me, “Japan needs a new spiritual founda-
tion for its forward look, and recreation will help.”

I would like to tell you more about Tatsuya Kato, also
a former cabinet member, now president of the Nippon
cinema, and a leading businessman of Japan. He was our
host while we were in Tokyo. He put at our disposal his

539

home, his office, his ear, and placed our mission first upon
his list because he thought it was contributing to a clearer
understanding between Japan and America and would re-
sult in more friendly relations.

I wish there were space to tell you of our visits to Japa-
nese homes and our sharing of Japanese family life, our
inspection of farms and factories large and small, our visits
to temples and shrines, our rides in cars, on boats and
trains and riekshaws, of our stay in Japanese-style hotels,
sleeping and eating as the Japanese did—all sandwiched
into a busy schedule. All of these contributed to an under-

standing of the people and their problems and gave us per-
spective for fitting recreation into the total picture.

There were many moving experiences. I recall standing
on the top of the City Hall in Hiroshima, where the first
atom bomb practically wiped out a city of 400,000 people,
and listening to the officials tell with pride of their rebuild-
ing this former war center into a city of peace—where
recreation is to have an important place: Rich in our
memory is the visit to Tenriko, home and headquarters of
the Tenri religion—where worshippers at sunrise and sun-
set dance to colorful mUsic, and where we swam in a mod-
crn pool and, after dining with the Grand Patriarch Shozen
Nakayama, joined his family in square dancing.

On one day we visited International Christian Univer-
sity, a fifty-year dream now being realized for an experi-
ment in international Christian education. We attended
the annual board meeting and later Dr. George Togasaki,
chairman of the board, and S. Saito showed us the cam-
pus. There is belief in recreation here and it will become
a source of leadership.

Here is a brief statement pointing up the strong points
of recreation in Japan as I saw it:

1) The development of sports. This is wide-spread,
and wherever I went I saw baseball, volleyball, swimming,
track, and ping pong.

2) Fishing, hiking, and mountain climbing. Interest
and participation in these is evident all over Japan.

3) Folk and square dancing. Interest in and develop-
ment of them is phenomenal, has swept the country.

4) Use of school facilities. I was delighted to see some
examples of the use of school facilities for community ree-

rcation in cities and in villages.

510

5) The National Recreation Congress in Kumantoto.
This was extraordinarily good, and showed a vitality and
a purposefulness that augers well for recreation in Japan.

6) Industrial recreation programs. Examples I saw
were good and excellent results were being achieved.

7) Study and research. There is much earnest think-
ing, questioning, and some research going on. This is very
healthy. Questions raised at meetings on techniques and
standards showed real thought.

8) Leadership of Prince Mikasa. His interest and
understanding, his devotion, his ability and his influence
make him a great asset for the recreation movement in
Japan. Prince Mikasa is the Joseph Lee of Japan.

Recommendations and suggestions for the Japanese to
which we gave greatest emphasis were:

1) Wide-spread interest in pachinko (pin ball machine
fad now sweeping the country) shows a hunger in the
hearts of the Japanese for recreation. This is a challenge
to recreation leaders and other thoughtful Japanese men
and women to provide more and better forms of recreation
for the pe0ple.

2) Trained leadership is essential; more attention
should be given to leadership and more funds should be
made available for it.

3) Children’s playgrounds should be better planned;
the number should be increased and leaders provided—
volunteer and paid.

4) Home and family play are almost an unexplored
field and offer great possibilities—there is a need to spell
out how and what to do.

5) Girls and women should be brought more actively
into recreation programs as participants and as leaders.

6) There is much interest in camping. It should be
carefully studied and pcople——children and families—
should be given opportunities to enjoy it. Bold statesman-
like leadership is needed to make camping in Japan an
asset instead of a liability.

7) Schools and eitizcns’ halls should be more widely
used as centers for community recreation, building on the

excellent start made.
8) Educational work needs to be done on: what conn-

munities can do for themselves; use of what they have now

in facilities; how recreation can be provided with limited
funds; values of recreation.

9) Need for strOng National Recreation Association of
Japan with funds and personnel to serve local groups. The
leadership should be broadened to include women and lay-
men with broad interests.

Those of you reading this report, who are looking for-
ward to service in this profession, can have the added as-
surance that this movement in the future will increasingly
be of value to the world at large, as it has been to Amer-
ica; that it can be an important factor in building the kind
of international understanding which is necessary if our
world, as we know it, is to survive.

A heavy burden rests upon those whose public and pro
fcssional responsibility is to brighten the lives of people.
Never was recreation service more important; never was
the opportunity for the philanthrOpic dollar greater.

Party Plans

GOOD party leader always plans for
A more games or activities than prob-
ably will be used. This enables him to
switch to something different as often
as is desirable. No game should be
played until interest begins to lag but,
rather, should be terminated while fun
is still at its height.

Balance the program with both ac-
tive and quiet games. All equipment
or properties needed should be assem-
bled and made ready in advance.

Plan some get acquainted or other
activities that can start as soon as the
first guests arrive. When the party is
large, divide into smaller groups, as
well as into partners. This device
makes for easier handling of games,
helps people get acquainted, and also
lends itself to “progressive” parties, in
which the winners move on to another
group and another activity.

Do not overstress competition, or
the awarding of prizes, but let your
attitude be that of playing the game
for the fun of it. If prizes are used
award them to the group or to part-
ners wherever possible, rather than to
individuals; and be sure that they are
inexpensive and humorous. If the lat-
ter, they can add fun to the festivities.

Your Valentine Party

For decorations -——hearts, cupids,
bows and arrows. All paper and pencil
games will seem more in keeping with
the season if you provide your guests
with red pencils and heart shaped pa-
per.

As a finale ust before refreshments,
why not try the following:

wide and wrap with yellow paper to
simulate a gold frame, or with red
paper to represent the edges of a valen-
tine. A curtain can be arranged to
slip easily on a rod attached to the top
of the frame. If this is not possible,
however, or your party is a small one,
the game can be played just the same.

Divide the guests into partners, or
groups, depending upon the size of
your party. Present each group with
a title, for which they are to compose
and present a living valentine in the
form of a tableau, while the remain-
ing guests act as the audience. Place
a time limit on this preparation—five
or ten minutes will do. If the party is
not a large one, provide crepe paper,
doilies, feathers, scissors, pins, and
other odds and ends of scraps from
which they can improvise costumes. If
desired, prizes can be awarded for the
best, funniest, and so on.

Further zest can be added to the fun
by turning each tableau into a guessing
contest. Choose the titles of the val-
entines from titles of well-known senti-
mental songs, for instance, such as
Little Gypsy Sweetheart, Annie Laurie,
and so on, or from book titles, or from
famous sweethearts, such as Priscilla
and John Alden, Romeo and Juliet,
Cupid and Psyche, and let the audi-
ence guess what is being depicted. In
this event, the actors must be careful
to display some unmistakable clues.

Your President’s Party

If you are giving a Washington’s or
Lincoln’s birthday party, why not drop
the cherries, hatchets and colonial sil-
houettes from the decorations this
year? Center the Hag—or several of
them—with a spotlight upon them if
possible. (Remember that Hags are
not to be draped.) For other decora-
tions, use red, white and blue.

 

Some “Whys” Behind the

Planning
—Claire Jeanne Weubbold

A well-planned evening can over-
come barriers—guests arriving in
cliques, unfamiliar location, strangers
in the group—to a good time for all.

Use tags as a means of team divi-
sion. Alternate the distribution of four
different colored tags. There is value
in this method when a clique arrives.
As each member receives a different
colored tag, the clique will be broken
as soon as teams are used, the “yel-
lows” being on one team, the “reds”
on another, and so on.

Use a game to overcome the self-
consciousness of pe0ple in a new loca-
tion. We all know that feeling of “at
home” when we are familiar with our
surroundings. A group can readily
acquire that good feeling through a
hunting game. Teams are organized
in the suggested manner. Hidden
around the room are squares of colored
paper. Team members roam around
the room in search of these for their
team’s credit. While doing this they
are becoming acquainted with their
environment; and the remainder of the
evening they will have lost that feel-
ing of strangeness.

Play several team games, so that the
members of the teams gain a feeling of
allegiance. Team spirit can result in
the making of new friendships.

Singing games and just old fashioned
community singing draw the whole
crowd together for a happy ending.

Recreation is the sugar and spice which makes life nice,

it involves just about all the real fun on earth! Those
of us who work professionally in the field of recreation,
and who are loyal to the finer philosophies of leisure, are
convinced that we do indeed have the very best jobs in all
the world. l’ublic recreation has swiftly taken its rightful
place as a newcomer among worthy professions, for here
is a public service founded on the good things of life.

We have come a long, long way since those early days of
the sand lots in Boston, or of the original Jane Addams’
Hull House in Chicago; and great strides forward are
easily within the memories of most of us. We, who are
engaged in this vocation, are, in reality, “public engineers
of human happiness.”

But even so meritorious a movement is completely de-
pendent upon the understanding and support of the people.
Their good will is a prerequisite to their approval, at the
polls, of the vital bond issues or tax funds which are so
necessary for the job.

In most departments the proof of the pudding is gen-
erously evidenced in the happy faces of participating
patrons. These are the satisfied customers of public recre-
ation, the friendly boosters, who are enlightened as to its
benefits.

But, how may we reach those throngs of uninformed
citizens who remain aloof and who apparently never make
use of our services? How can we rightfully eXpect that
these strangers-to-our-causc shall cheerfully pay taxes to
support a service of which they know little or nothing?
Many of these goodly pc0ple are your neighbors and mine;
many of them doubtless still think of a recreation center
as an unsupervised place in which to play ball, a hangout
for underprivileged children, or a public cure-all for ju-
venile delinquency.

Let us not ever be so naive as to assume that public
recreation departments can effectively function for long
without the promotion and maintenance of good public
relations. ft is imperative that we seek the good will of
Mr. John  Taxpayer, and that we shall confide in him
at all times, for it is he who sits in the driver’s seat. He
should always know whither we are going and why. Then,
and only then, will he be our friendly partner and our
staunch supportcr. It is as simple as that!

And ust exactly how may this best be accomplished?

It is my earnest plea that we develop a greater under-
standing of the principles of good salesmanship, and that
we learn to apply those principles universally in our work.
We must actually sail our philosophies, just as surely as if
we were selling tangihle commodities. That is the magic
formula. Let us see how it works.

First, consider the aspects of salesmanship in a more
technical sense, as interpreted by the leaders of the
business world.

The Ingredients of Good Salesmt-niship

Salesmansliip is simply an optimistic form of applied
psychology. That is to say, it is psychology so applied as

to win friendly reactions and to influence people to our
way of thinking. But salesmanship is also a thoroughly
practical science, the successful use of which requires that
we shall observe a few simple laws that govern it.

Sales experts of the business world tell Us that all real
salesmanship embodies a standard pattern of procedure
which clearly distinguishes it from the more commonplace
type of transaction known as order-taking. A few basic
steps are always observed in the conduct of any genuine
sale, regardless of what we are selling; for certain charac-
teristics invariably exist in any sale, regardless of whether
our transaction is completed in five minutes or five years,
and regardless of whether we are selling a visible article
or an intangible idea.

Here then are these basic fundamental steps or elements
which are apparent in any ethical sale:

1. The Approach (Attracting Attention)—The sales-
man makes a friendly contact with his prospective cus-
tomer, and attempts to capture willing attention.

2. The Appeal (Stimufating lntercst)—The salesman
focuses the customer’s attention upon the quality, the func-
tion, the value and the desirability of the merchandise or
idea which is being sold. This demands a tactful explana-
ion or presentation of related facts with possibly a prac-
tical demonstration. The customer’s imagination is stimu-
lated, and he gains just enough information or knowledge
to further whet his curiosity; and many questions race
through his mind.

"How much will this cost me and can I afford it? Do I
really need it or want it, and how does it compare with
the competitive product which some other person or or-
ganization is trying to sell me? Why should I rush into
it: maybe I should take my time and look around."

This is the salesman’s golden opportunity to gain the
eonfidenee and trust of his customer, and to motivate in

him a strong interest in the merchandise or idea. All ques-
tions, all doubts, and all objections are met with courteous
assurance and with a satisfactory explanation. This is the
friendly duel of pros and cons.

3. The Favorable Response (Desire Is Amused)—
Now comes that most critical moment when the customer
mentally surrenders to the suggestions of the salesman.
Actually he has been so guided in his thinking as to agree
with the salesman’s proposition inwardly if not orally. His
actions and speech will now indicate to the salesman that
all sales-resistance has been lowered or reduced to a mini-
mum. The customer has sold himself on the idea of being
sold. Now he is willing or ready to buy, perhaps even
eager to complete the transaction. Now he desires to pos-
sess that which is offered for sale!

The expert salesman is quick to recognize these symp-
toms as being signals inviting action. Thus far he has
done his work well, but can he finish the sale?

4. The Deal Is Closed { Action is Produced )—Now he
seeks to complete the deal while the “iron is hot.” Strange-
ly, perhaps, this last step is often the most difficult of all
for the salesman. He knows that the sale is never com-
pleted until the final details are concluded.

This requires that there must be a mutual accord be-
tween salesman and customer, in these final moments of
suspense, if we are to achieve a happy ending. But, be-
causc action is the normal outgrowth of desire, the deal is
ultimately closed, and we should have a satisfied customer
and a highly pleased salesman. A sale has been made.

Note: In actual practice several of these steps may often be
combined or mixed together, or we may witness one of them
strongly overshadowing the others. But their individual identity
is never completely lost.

The foregoing analysis reveals that a sale is possible of
completion only if and when the customer is ready to buy.
In other words, any sale is in reality first completed in the
mind of the customer. He must like what he sees and hears,
or there can be no transaction.

The consistently successful salesman of the business
world is keenly aware of this. In fact, his entire strategy
is planned and conducted with this one question constantly
in mind, “How may 1 encourage in the customer a strongly
impelling desire to possess that commodity or idea which
I am trying to sell?”

Characteristics of a Consistently Successful Salesman

There are many theorics for success in selling, but the
basic formula boils down to the application of a few quali-
ties or skills which are universally known to produce de-
sired results. Thus, whether we are selling automobiles, or
whethcr we are selling our services in public recreation,
ou-r effectiveness will depend upon our proficiency in keep-
ing within these simple axioms of good salesmanship:

A. The good salesman has a thorough knowledge of the
merchandise or the idea which he is trying to sell. There
is no substitute for being well informed as a means of
commandeering the respect of the customer.

B. The good salesman has good personality-traits. His
appearance, manner of speech, actions and behavior must
mcct with the approval of the customer. Physically, men-

FEBRUARY 1953

tally, morally and emotionally he must “pass inspection.”

Much has been written on this subject, emphasizing the
many personal qualities of an ideal salesman. He will be
tactful, cheerful, honest, punctual, reliable, courteous, and
so on. The list is long indeed.

But all authorities agree that the one indispensable qual-
ity, above all else, is that conscientious loyalty to the cause,
which we know as a good attitude. His attitude must re-
veal that he loves his work, and that he is personally very
much sold on what he is doing. He implicitly believes in
the merits of the merchandise which he would sell to others.
Thus is generated the contagious spark of enthusiasm.

And further, a good attitude should clearly indicate that
the salesman has the interests of his customer sincerely at
heart at all times. For that very important person is at
once the judge and the jury of this dramatic episode.

C. The good salesman must have a generous capacity for
hard work, intelligently organized to produce results. In
other words, he must have the mental ability to plan a log-
ical campaign, and the physical energy to carry it through
to completion. He knows what to do, and so he does it.

Likewise, it is important that he must know what not to
do. For example, his enthusiasm should never be overly
excessive, or artificial, lest he be suspected of ulterior mo-
tives (high-pressure tactics). Too, he will refrain from
talking too much and for too long a time, as this is called
“overselling” and can quickly nullify all chances of a sale.
Similarly he knows full well the utter futility of arguing
with those to whom he would like to sell his idea.

The successful salesman has the “know-how” of getting
along with people; and he leaves no ethical stones un-
turned in attempts to motivate the reactions of customers.

Fine words these, for the hard-boiled world of business.
But just exactly what has all this to do with our work in
public recreation? Surely we are not to be concerned with
such highly technical theories of salesmanship?

Where and When Do We Sell Public Recreation?

Everything we do in our field of public recreation in-
volves opportunities for us to help our citizens achieve
greater happiness; and our success in this regard may de-
pend very largely upon the manner in which we apply the
basic principles of salesmanship in our tasks.

Whenever we talk’on the telephone, whenever we con-
verse or correspond with others, whenever we meet with
citizens individually or in groups, whenever, wherever and
however we contact pe0ple, we are the potential salesmen
and they are the potential customers.

We are selling ourselves, our services, our department,
our ideals and the objectives for which we stand. The rec-
reation center or playground, the swimming pool or pub-
lic beach, the sports field or craft center, the park or the
city hall—these are the fox-holes of public Opinion, where

each and every taxpayer is ready to evaluate the depart-
ment by what he sees and hears.

The Recreation Worker as a Salesman

Our professional recreation worker is steeped in the high
ideals of his calling, but he is also a thoroughly practical

543

person, skilled in the art of being helpful to others. Always
and in all ways he is meeting pe0ple and more people.
He captures their attention, he stimulates their interest,
thus arousing their desires to participate in the benefits of
public recreation, and then he produces opportunities for
action, which represents “closing the deal.” The standard
familiar pattern of salesmanship is clearly evident through-
out the day’s activities.

It requires a lot of real salesmanship to develop high
standards of sportsmanship among those who play on the
athletic field; or to encourage timid beginners to learn the
skills of swimming and diving; or to prove that it’s a
happy experience to make things with one’s own hands; or
to organize a club, direct a community sing, call a square
dance, and to stimulate active participation for all. It
takes a salesman to effectively organize a recreation pro-
gram with due regard for the needs of the local com-
munity.

Also, we might ask ourselves what happens when a de-
partmean representative appears as guest speaker before
some local service club or civic group or parent-teachers’
association, or when one of the top-flight administrators or
executives of your department meets with a citizens’ com-
mittee to discuss the pros and cons of some knotty prob-
lcm involving public recreation. Surely these are occa-

sions which call for salesmanship of the highest degree.
The list of examples is endless indeed, revealing the
needs for the continuous application of the basic prin-
ciplcs of salesmanship in all the many phases of our work.
Our professional recreation worker is not expected to do
the total job singlchanded or alone, however. Our mythi-
cal sales-manager leaves no stones unturned in his efforts
to muster a one hundred per cent sales-team; for we should
be content with nothing less than a maximum in salesman-
ship on the part of each and every employee on the payroll.
Moreover, an employee may not necessarily be one of
our professional recreation workers, but could be any staff
employee—-—any clerk, janitor and so on—in the department.
The positive attitude and spirit of good salesmanship
should permeate every nook and cranny of the organiza-
tion. It is not enough that the truck driver shall know
how to drive a truck. It is not enough that the stenog-
rapher shall be skilled in typing and shorthand. It is im-
perative that all employees in any public recreation de-
partment shall know why their services are needed; that
they understand something of the philosOphies and func-
tions of their departments, and that they themselves shall
be acquainted with the basic traditions and objectives of
our work. In other words, we first of all must sell ourselves
on what we are doing, before we can successfully hope to
sell our ideas to others with maximum effectiveness.
Thus, even the humblest employee can be made to feel
that he belongs on our sales-force, that his task is a vital
part of a great public service. This is, of course, the ideal
goal, when all employees of the department discover that
we are working together in a common cause, and when
this spirit is reflected in the positive attitude of each and
every human being on the payroll.

The Private Citizen as a Salesman

Who is the all-powerful third man on our team? An in-
dispensable member of our sales-staff is he, his salesman-
ship spells the word “a-c-t-i-o-n”. We refer of course to the
enlightened citizen who seeks the good things of life, and
who knows the value of wholesome activity for his family
and for himself, for his friends and neighbors, and for his
community. He has tasted the “samples”, and he wants
more——bigger and better playgrounds and parks, with pro-
fessional leadership on the job, plus an adequate financial
budget to make all this possible.

His sales-talk may be heard informally over the back-
yard fence on a Sunday afternoon, it might be voiccd
more vigorously at the local chamber of commerce, or it
might be expressed more formally within the cloistcrs of
the city council. But wherever and whenever he has the
slightest opportunity, this willing worker sings the praises
of public recreation.

It is this type of volunteer who becomes our super-sales-
man, and arouscs a public-rccreation-minded citizenry to
approve recreational bond issues at the polls, and to elect
those political leaders to ollice who respect public rccrea-
tion as a truly essential service.

Surely we should scrutinize and utilize all potentialities
in this our task of selling public recreation. It is up to us!

IF OUR best educated guessers are cor-
rect we, in America, may be in the
process of defending—with our re-
sources and manpower—hour demo-
cratic form of free society for at least
one decade, and perhaps for several.
If the free people of the world are to
defend the democratic way of life,
against communism and against those
who would force their ideology upon
the world, we must anticipate that the
young people of today, and of genera-
tions yet unborn, will serve some of
the most impressionable years of their
lives in a military environment. They
will eventually become alumni of the
“University of the Military.” Such cit-
izen soldiers, coming from the civilian
communities of the country, will re-
turn to civilian life and become the
American citizen of tomorrow. What
happens to them during their military
service can not help but be reflected in
this nation’s future culture.

Every insurance must be taken to
keep alive in these young men and wo-
men the essence of our democratic so-
ciety—our freedom and our American
way of life. It would be mockery and
tragedy if that freedom, which we pre-
pare to defend, were lost in the process

Today’s Challenge to the Community Leader

of preparation and training for defense.
During the past wars, we were re-
conciled to the fact that the civilian
soldier was taking “time out” from the
usual flow of his life, and we antici-
pated and expected casualties, among
the men in service, in education and
certain other fields. It is now more
generally accepted that military service
can be and must be a “plus-time” in the
lives of the young men and women who
make up this large civilian-military
force within our democracy. We are
becoming more and more convinced
that it can not be a time of negative
experience or one that demoralizes.
Obviously, there is a responsibility,
not only for the military commander
but for the civilian leader, to keep
alive the virtues of our society and to
encourage during both on-duty and off-
duty hours the growlh and development
of our youth as future citizens. Their
morale in the service must be high, and
their usefulness as citizens of the fu-
ture increased. We believe that they
can be sent back to their communities
better developed human beings and bet-
ter citizens than when they entered the
service. Therefore, such a responsibil-
ity can not be assumed by the military
commander alone. It must be shared
by the national organization directors
and the community and civic leaders.
American communities have in the

past adjusted themselves to new reSpon-
sibilities, and established community
organizations to meet the challenges of
their section and of the day. It is rea-
sonable to assume that, given insight
into the long-range responsibility of '
this problem, they will understand and
undertake their obligations. In creat-
ing a wholesome and hOSpitable en-
vironment for the youthful stranger
away from home, all our community
leadership and resources must be en-
listed. This includes the organizations
in education, religion, health, safety,
recreation, welfare, and housing as well
as the open door of hospitality into the
best of our family life. The American
communities near our posts and camps
realize they can not put barriers around
their customary way of life, nor do they
eXpect to build a stockaded reservation
in the form of a service club in the cen-
ter of the city to avoid a penetration
of service personnel into the usual way
of life within the community.

They know that the golden rule
should be operative. In the real sense,
the communities have loaned their
youth to other communities—who
should, in turn, greet cordially the 0p-
portunity to accept as youthful guests
these men and women of the services,
who have been brought to the military
installation. There is a continuing need
of integrating the military installation

545

and the nearby communities where the
youth in the services will be spending
their free time. Communities need to
organize their leadership and resources
to do a completely effective job. This
community leadership includes the tax-
supported governmental agencies in rcc-
reation, education, health and welfare.
The voluntary services of the civic,
patriotic, fraternal, welfare, the reli-
gious and special interest groups of the
neighborhood should play an impor-
tant part in the program. The commer-
cial recreation services such as motion
picture theatres, bowling alleys, skat-
ing rinks, and so forth, are important
facilities for this off-post recreation.
The doors of hOSpitality, of the humble
and the affluent alike, should be thrown
open for the innumerable home-like

events that mean so much to the men
and women in the service. When the
community has strained its own re-
sources to the limit, and meets prob-
lems beyond the range of its commu-
nity resources, then the outside assist-
ance from voluntary and governmental
agencies should be called upon. These
resources will be found in the many
national, private or voluntary organi-
zations, as well as in our public agen-
cies. (They include United Service Or-
ganizations, United Community De-
fense Services, National Recreation As-
sociation, American Legion, Federal
Security Agency, Public Health Serv-
ice, the Ofliee of Education, and the
Federal Housing Agency.)

The Army and the Air Force Com-

munity Services have organized a field

staff to work with military commanders
and community leaders to interpret,
counsel, stimulate and advise in the
better use of off-post leadership and re-
sources: for furthering the program;
for better facilities and services within
the community for the recreation and
welfare of service personnel. The job
is so large that there is a place for all
organizations and individuals who care
to join the team. There is no time or
place for jurisdictional jealousies or
agency conflicts. No time, effort and
ingenuity can be wasted to defend im-
aginary professional borderlines. The
Community Services Program affords
the opportunity for integrating all the
forces in recreation and welfare in a
united effort for the youth of America
who will be our future citizens.

Are You Progressive?

More and more community recrea-
tion departments, these days, are using
an excellent device to educate the
local public recreation-wise, to set
forth the year’s accomplishments and
plans for the future, and to promote
current activities. Each year, they
utilize a full page, or more, of the
local newspaper to either present their
annual report to the community, or to
issue an invitation to citizens to par-
ticipate in recreation department ac-
tivities. Attractive layouts, artwork
and photographs are used in many
cases. The project is financed through
the cooperation of community mer-
chants, whose names appear some-
where on the page.

In Manhattan, Kansas, for example,
where community cooperation is the
keynote of the whole presentation,
headlines announce to readers, “This
is Your lnvitation to Participate in
Your Recreation Activities! School
Year l930-51 Recreation!"
drawings of recreation activities are
used. and the sheet is headed by a
letter to citizens, signed by the snper-
intendent of recreation and his as-

Line

sistant, which says in part, “Listed
here are some of the activities spon-
sored by the various organizations of
our city. . . . Cooperation rather than
competition will enable our pe0ple to
have a full, happy and worthwhile sea-
son. Watch the newspapers for special
events.” Boxed notices describe the
variety of activities, giving pertinent
information as to time, place and
sponsor. In the center of the page,
under the caption, “Progressive Com-
munitics Cooperate,” a list of the local
hobby groups and clubs, is followed
by these three suggestions:

' In order for your child to obtain
the best from his school year we urge
you to join and take an active part in
your Parent-Teachers Association.

' To receive the full value of religion
we feel that it is good for you to take
advantage of all the social program
offered by the chnrch of your choice.
' Do what you can to provide your
home, your back yard and your living
room with the best you can for your-
self and your family to enjoy together.
Remember, families that play together,
stay together.

The page is signed by the merchants
who sponsor the advertisement.

most of them presenting an annual

run by Boeing employees with the sponsorship and help
of management. It is generally considered to be the largest
one-day salmon derby in the world. Participation seems
to be limited only by the number of boats available. This
year 1,500 ardent anglers cast their lines from some 750
boats. Over 5,000 employees vied for the honor. Because
of the high interest and the limited number of boats avail-
able, a ticket drawing was held and the lucky 1,500 were
selected. The suSpense during this drawing is so great each
year that it threatens to become as big an event as the
derby itself. .

fish on either of two large bay areas on sparkling Puget
Sound, which borders the west portion of Seattle. Various
commercial boathouses surrounding the fishing areas sup-
ply the boats, with one boathouse on each bay designated
as official weighing station. All fish caught must be
weighed in at one of these official stations in order to qual-
ify for a prize. After the weighing-in ceremonies, and a
moderate amount of milling around and gnashing of teeth,
all contestants and spectators are invited to repair to the
main cafeteria at the Boeing Plant No. 2. There, at noon,
prizes are awarded to those gold-plated, shot-with-luck
characters who have caught the biggest fish.

Through the courtesy of Boeing Airplane Company, and
through receipts from ticket sales, more than fifty prizes,
amounting to ncarly $5000 worth of merchandise, are
awarded annually. This year’s prizes included: a 16-foot
boat with 16 h.p. outboard motor, 21-inch television set,
dcep-frceze unit, coffeemaker, garden tools, fishing equip-
ment, powcr lawnmower, houschold wares, and others.

A novel feature is the annual awarding of the thirteenth
placc mystery prize. The possessor of the thirteenth largest
fish caught in the derby receives the mystery prize, the
identity of which is kept “t0p secret" until the crucial mo-
ment of award. This year the “lucky thirteenth” was a

before took first prize, a woman who had never fished be-
fore won the thirty-third prize, and a man who caught a
seagull won the mystery prize (he also caught a 12-pound
7-ounce salmon). An adept swoop with a dip net fur-
nished him with the careless seagull which he brought
along to the prize awarding for luck.

in all, 168 salmon were boated this year, ranging from
16 pounds on down. The winning fish in the ’51 Derby
was a 35-pound king salmon.

Anticipation runs high for months beforehand among
the employees. The thrill of tying into one of these thrash-
ing, twisting, powerful titans of fishdom is an experience
easy to dream of and very hard to forget. And the lure
of the prize displays for the lucky winners does not in any
sense tarnish the dream. Preparations are exactingly made.
Equipment and conditions must be right for the big day.
Even the date of the derby is carefully selected by “ex-
perts” in the field of salmon prognostication. Strangely
enough, and fortunately, the past two derby dates have
fallen precisely on days of large salmon runs. The experts,
of course, immediately claimed mystic powers, and for
months were heard to mutter darkly of spawning cycles,
tidal conditions, hcrring schools, and quarters of thc moon.

When derby day arrives the water is dotted with boats
and the docks are crowded with excited spectators watch-
ing the fishermen as they wcigh in their prize catches. The
air is filled with good fellowship such as only fishing com-
panionship can bring; and everyone, labor and manage-
ment together, has a whale of a time.

Symphony Orchestra

If you listen to the Philharmonic
Symphony Concert over CBS, on Sun-
days, you will have noticed that the in-
termission is often given over to a
story about the activities of some spe-
cific community symphony orchestra.
We called Mr. James Fassett, super-
visor of music at CBS, who acts as
commentator for the program, to find
out where and how he obtains his in-
formation for this program, and to
tell him a bit about community recrea-
tion department activities. Most of his
information, to date, has come from
the American Symphony Orchestra
League.

He assures us, however, that he is
interested in receiving reports of any
symphony orchestras, amateur or
otherwise, which are sponsored by
any recreation departments, private or-
ganizations, communities, and so on,

FEBRUARY 1953

particularly those in sections of the
country where there is no regular mu-
sical program, or where the orchestra
travels to rural sections of the country
to bring music to those who would
otherwise not hear “live” music. He
tries to use news of programs that are
different or unusual, and is interested
in receiving specific information as to
how the group was organized, how it
functions, who bears the responsibil-
ity, how it is financed, and any infor-
mation that might prove useful to
others wishing to initiate similar proj-
ects. ‘

There is no regular series planned,
nor are specific dates set for using the
information, in the intermission talks,
and of course he cannot promise to
use all of the material sent to him.

If you have a symphony orchestra
in your town, which is in any way
unusual or outstanding, here is a

ognition. Why not write the details to

Mass Ball

Special events on our playground
during a Thanksgiving Field Day, in-
cluded Mass Ball. A five-foot-high, air-
filled, canvas ball, which is used in
army programs to condition the sol-
diers, was on loan from the nearby
army post at Fort Belvior, Virginia.
Excited, dungaree clad youngsters
were divided equally, into teams, ac-
cording to age and sex, with approxi-

mately twenty-five participants on each
team. The ball was placed in the cen-
ter of a football field; the respective
team members were back twenty yards
from the ball; the referee blew his
whistle, and away they went, pushing,
lifting, kicking, in an attempt to move
the ball across the goal line. After
twenty minutes of unrestrained effort
the contest was called a draw.

Among other activities on our special
program was the always p0pular tug-0f-
war. The children were excited, be-
cause at the end of the line a water-
soaked mud hole awaited the team who
didn’t quite have'enough “oomph” in
their pull.- A muddy time was enjoyed
by all!

Then came the gathering around the
grandstand for the drawing of the
lucky numbers for the door prizes.
Everyone had received a numbered
ticket upon cntering the playground.

 

Huge canvas pnshball, borrowed from a
nearby army post, is used in a spirited
game of Mass Ball, one of the special
events at Sonsa’s Thanksgiving Field Day.

“Miss Thanksgiving”, in pigtails, plaid
shirt, and dungarees, drew the lucky
numbers from the box. The grand
prize was a bushel basket of food; and
ten other lucky winners received free
tickets to nearby theaters. These
prizes were donated by the recreation
council, a volunteer group of parents
in the community.

HERBERT RATHNER, recreation direc-

tor of the Sousa Recreation Center,

Washington, D. C.

Presenting a few pet ideas that have worked successfully, as reported
by recreation executives at the 34th National Recreation Congress.

Pet Ideas

Teen Age Advisory Council. (K.
Mark Cowen, Department of Parks and
Recreation, Elkhart, Indiana.) His de-
partment has had a thirteen-member
Junior Advisory Council for four years.
Composed of teenagers, it sponsors a
variety of activities, some of which re-
quire the raising of funds. Among
them is an annual meeting with thc
city council and the superintendent of
schools. This affair is a free dinner
for the city and school oflicers and is
financed by money-raised by the Ad-
visory Council. Teen-age members pre-
side at the mecting, which is unre-
hearsed, and tell what they think about
civic and school planning. Originally,
the council was selected, with thc as-
sistancc of the dean of boys and thc
dean of girls at the local high school,
from among the sophomore, junior
and senior elasses—-four from each
class and one member at large. At thc
outset it was indicated that the recrea-
tion department wanted young people
with ideas, and with energy and initi-
ative, who might not fit into the usual
“mold.” These young people now as-
sist in selecting new members for the
council as they are needed.

Playground Advisory Councils.
(Jack M. lloxscy, Department of Parks
and Recreation, San Diego, California.)
They have advisory councils for all
playgrounds, to help in planning the
programs for those areas. Memhers
of a council include represcntativcs
from l’TA's, school officials, private
agencies, churches and other groups
interested in the “husincss of recrea-
tion.” They meet at least three times
a year, previous to each seasonal pro-
gram, to plan and schedule activities
to meet the needs of the playground

550

community. They also help to estab-
lish priorities in the use of equipment,
in the scheduling of activities, and rep-
resent their playground at meetings
held by the city recreation department.
They are also a coordinating group for
special events. They have no budget.
This is their third year of operation.

“Buck” Contest. (Guy \Vertz, Wau-
kesha, Wisconsin.) Every child arriv-
ing on the playground, as the program
bcgan, was given a “buck” of special
papcr money printed by the recreation
department. This earried notations
about the department on onc side and
was labeled “One Buck” on the other.
The child could also‘rcceivc an addi-
tional buck for doing “chores” on the
playground. At thc end of the season,
the dcpartment collected old pieces of
equipment, and many local merchants
contributed additional items, for an
auetion at which the children were
given opportunity to purchase any of
the itcms that appcaled to them with
the bucks they had earned during the

80850".

Christmas Institute. (Margaret Wil-
son, Board of Parks and Recreation,
Winnipeg, Canada.) Before Christmas,
the department sponsors a Christmas
institute, at which women in thc com-
munity teach each other Christmas
crafts traditional with their families or
nationalities. Sincc Winnipeg has a
large foreign-horn pepulation, this pro-
vides a socializing activity of great
value. Thc only specification is that
the craft taught must use odds and ends
of materials. Now in its third year,
the institute is so large that more of
them will have to be scheduled.

Mcn's Cake-Baking Contest. (Scl-

wyn Orcutt, Recreation and Parks
Department, Fayetteville, North Caro-
lina.) This community, near Ft. Bragg.
has ust held a men’s cake-baking con-
test in whieh there were sixty-two en-
tries. Prizes were offered by two com-
mercial concerns which eooperated
with the local recreation department in
conducting the contest—Sears and Roe-
buck and General Mills. The first prize,
an electric cooker donated by Sears,
was won by a chaplain, while the sec-
ond prize went to a local eitizen, and
third prize to a lieutenant colonel from
the base. (As is usual with activities
of this kind in this community, hccause
of the proximity of such a large mili-
tary reservation, thc activity was a
joint military-civilian one.) The old-
est participant was seventy-two years
of agc. The contest was advertised
through use of posters, spot ads, and
radio announcements. Cakcs were
judged on the hasis of taste, texture,
and looks, with homc economics teach-
ers, housewives from the city and the
base, and the mayor acting as judges.
Cakcs, had to be haked at home by the
men. Women were allowed to super-
vise but not assist in the baking. It
was felt that entrants were honest in
their entries. The prize-winner gave
his recipc over the radio after awards
were presented.

Men’s Cake-linking Elimination
Contest. (Fran Ilartzell, Department
of llecrcation, Chambersburg. Penn-
sylvania.) Chamhershurg also holds a
men’s cake-baking contest, but con-
ducts eliminations in the various clubs
of the city first. Winners then meet for
the “hakc-ofls" at the V.F.\V. club-
rooms, with General Electric Company
supplying the stoves, General Mills the

RECREATION

 

home economists for judging. An ad-
mission fee of ten cents per person is
charged and cakes are auctioned at
the end of the contest. Funds thus ob-
tained go to the department for other
activities.

Mother-Child Swimming Lessons.
(Keith McDonald, Vallejo, California.)
A series of classes is offered for moth-
ers of children of about two and a half
years and older. Both mother and child
get into the pool at the same time,
learn basic swimming skills, and the
mother is prepared to go on from there.

Little Decatur Baseball Leagues.
(R. J. Foval, Superintendent of Recre-
ation, Decatur, Illinois.) Twenty-four
teams participated in the Leagues in
1952. These are conducted on a strict-
ly local competition basis, with no out-
of-town trips or other competition.
This fact was established and adver-
tised at the outset so there could be no
complaints later. Definite regulations
were also established. There were no
uniforms unless the boys wanted to
buy them, and then the purchase was
restricted to a hat and T-shirt. Because
of publicity about little leagues in gen-
eral, many service clubs have wanted
to assist in the program; so, in 1953,
four different service clubs have been
designated as sponsors of the four dif-
ferent leagues, and each club is limi-
ted to a hundred dollar expenditure.

Playground Safety Signs. (Mrs.
Martha Turner, Supervisor of Recrea-
tion, Memphis, Tennessee.) Painted
signs providing a space for keeping a
playground safety tally are hung under
playground bulletin boards. These give
information on the number of days
without accident on each playground.

FEBRUARY 1953

Statistics are brought up-to-date each
morning at the time of the flag-raising
ceremony.

Today in Recreation—Bulletin
Board Showcase. (Tom Belser, Su-
perintendent of Parks and Recreation,
Montgomery, Alabama.) A 5 foot by
10 foot bulletin board showcase, about
4 inches deep, was attached to a build-
ing located on one of the most promi-
nent corners in the city this summer.
It was equipped with a sliding glass
door. The background was white. In-
side the case in huge letters were the
words “Today in Recreation.” Under-
neath the heading were listed current
facts on the recreation pr0gram in the
city. These were changed once or
twice a day to keep the board up-to-
date. Although it was not locked dur-
ing the first half of the summer, there
was no vandalism. The board was very
popular and two or three businesses
in the city have already adopted the
same method of reaching the public.
One of the problems involved in such
a project is the matter of keeping the
board up-to-date over a long period of
time.

Tom Sawyer Day. (Thelma Wicke,
SUperintendent of Aquatics, Honolulu.)
0n the Saturday before the beginning
of the annual “learn-to-swim” program
the children gather on the beaches for
“Tom Sawyer Day.” Approximately
1,800 children “comb” the beaches for
materials—the purpose being to get
them clean for swim week. The activ-
ity is also a treasure hunt, for the chil-
dren collect all kinds of things, some of
real value, in addition to debris. Any
money which the dcpartment obtains
from the items found, goes into a fund
which is used in the program. It has
been noted, however, that the children
would be willing to participate even if
they did not find any real treasure
simply because it is fun.

Cheering Corps as a Dance Activ-
ity. (Mrs. Elsie Allen, Friends of the
Dance, Tacoma, \Vashington.) Partic-
ipants get partners and divide into
groups. Each group elects a director
who comes to the leader for directions
on lining up a “cheering corps” in his
group. Each person-in the groupleads

a cheer. If they do not know a cheer,
they get together first for a “growl”
and get into the Spirit of the activity.
After each person has led a cheer in
his group, one person is selected to
represent the group and the chosen
ones from each group compete with
each other, the “winner” then being
given opportunity to lead the entire
assembly.

Talent Programs. (Mrs. Mildred
Hughes, Recreation Director, City Park
Bureau, Portland, Oregon.) Different
age groups, having special interests,
join together and practice for talent
pr0grams. When they have their pro-
grams worked up, they go out for pub-
lic appearances before civic groups.
Most of the groups are composed of
teen-agers, and these appearances help
to make them civic-minded. All races
participate. '

Free Swimming Lessons for Play-
ground Attendants. (George Mark-
ley, Director of Recreation, St. Joseph,
Missouri.) A plan for exchanging
services on the playground, for play—
ground attendants, with one lesson for
each service session, resulted in the
giving of 3,000 free lessons last sum-
mer to such attendants.

Youth Honor Day. (George Mark-
ley, Recreation Director, St. Joseph,
Missouri.) The young pe0ple in the
community sign pledges not to destroy
property on Halloween. Those who
sign the pledge are given a free party
in a central spot. About 4,000 children
participated last year. The Moose

Lodge was the cooperating agency.

ply of such "ideas"?—Ed. '

Many of these facts cover implica-
tions which are significant for the
recreation field. Among the needs
that demand study and action by
leaders in the recreation movement,
as pointed up by the figures, are the
needs to:

Provide, near the homes of chil-
dren, more recreation facilities such
as play lots in large-scale housing
develOpments, or sections for young
children in neighborhood play-
grounds to serve the increasing num-
ber of children of pre-sehool age.

Make plans for recreation areas,
facilities and leadership to take care
of the needs of the increasing nnm-
her of children of elementary school
age in the years ahead.

Set aside recreation areas in su-
burban communities near large
population centers, in anticipation
of the rapid rise in p0pulation.

Study the amount and types of
recreation areas most appr0priate to
the central portions of our large
cities that are losing population.

Devel0p programs for the increas-
ing percentage of the p0pulation
over sixty years of age who have
much leisure.

Make sure that the need for
greatly increased funds for school
sites and classrooms results in eo-
operative planning on the part of
school and city authorities and does
not result in elimination
school buildings of facilities suit-
able for community recreation use.

Give more consideration in rec-
reation programs to the needs of
women and girls.

Recognize that the need for com-
munity provision of play Opportuni-
ties for young children is increasing
as the size of families decreases.

The facts revealed by the 1950 cen-
sus, with reference to changes in the
composition of our p0pulation and ya-
rious other population trends, have

in new

552

much interest for all who are concerned
with planning for recreation in the
years ahead. The census figures will
be useful to professional and lay lead-
ers in the field of recreation, to the
extent that regional and national char-
acteristics revealed by the figures are
correctly interpreted and adapted to
local situations. An excellent summary
of significant census data, issued by
the Research Division of the National
Education Association of the United
States,‘I affords the basis for the state-
ment that follows.

The 1950 total population of the
Continental United States was 150,697,-
361, an increase of more than 19,000,-

sulted quite largely from natural in-
crease rather than from net gains from
immigration. Beginning in 194-1, the
birth rate began to climb, reaching 25.8
per 1,000 in 1947, the all-time high
since the birth-registration areas have
functioned. There have been slight de-
clines since 1947, but, according to
the best estimate, the rate in 1950 was
23.5 per 1,000 population. This ap-
proximates the rates for the period
1917 to 1921.

The increase in birth rate since 1910
has been relatively much greater for
the urban population than for the rural.
The actual birth rate for urban resi-
dents since 194-7 has been higher than

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS

000 persons over 1940. It represents a
rate of increase twice as rapid as that
which occurred between 1930 and
194-0, and it brought the nation’s total
population almost to the figure which,
in 1940, had been predicted for 1980—
a full generation hence. Thus the to-
tal population figure for 1950 itself in-
dicates a sharp acceleration in the ex-
pected growth trend. The sharp up-
turn between 1940 and 1950, to an in-
crease of 14.5 per cent was unexpected
by most students of p0pulation trends.
During the past half-century, be-
tween 1900 and 1950, the p0pulation
has approximately doubled. This fact,
together with the doubled rate of in-
crease of the past decade, strongly in-
dicates that the era of a static pepula-
tion is not yet at hand. Economic and
social planning, including plans for
public education, must be geared to the
idea of growth and expansion, at least
for the years immediately ahead.
Only four states—Arkansas, Missis-
sippi, North Dakota, and Oklahoma—
had net losses in p0pulation between
l9-10 and 1950, in each case very slight
losses.
Birth and Death Rates—The pepula-

tion growth of recent years has re-

 

I - "scion. and the 1950 Census", Research
Bulletin, December, 1951.

the rate for the rural people. The
birth rate for the non-white population
ru-ns consistently higher than that for
whites. Another significant trend dur-
ing the past decade is the relatively
greater increase in the reproduction
rate for well-educated women than for
those of low educational attainment.

During the past decade the death
rate has continued to decline. Mortal-
ity statistics go back only to 1900, but
in the half-century just ended the death
rate has been out almost in half. For
1900, the death rate was 17.2 per 1,000
p0pulation. The rate has gone on down
to an estimated 9.6 per 1,000 for 1950
—an all-time low since mortality sta-
tistics have been reported. lnfant
death rates are slightly higher in rural
areas than in urban, 33.1 as compared
with 31.2 in 1948.

General Population Characteristics—
Among the characteristics of popula-
tion of special significance for recrea-
tional planning are: age distribution,
racial distribution, marital status, size
of families, and rural-urban distribu-
tion. A shift in the sex distribution of
the population is pointed out as a mat-
ter of general interest. In 1950, for
the first time in census history, the
number of women exceeded the number
of men by over a million, bringing the

Recnmnos

sex ratio to 98.1 men per 100 women.
In rural areas, men outnumbered wo-
men, but in urban areas the ratio was
only 94.1 men per 100 women. At
present an appreciable excess of fe-
males over males is found only in age
groups beyond fifteen years.

The rate at which the average age of
the population of the United States is
rising was checked slightly by the re-
cent upturn in the nation’s birth rate,
but has not been halted. The increase
between 1940 and 1950 in the per cent
of the p0pulation under five years of
age (from 8.0 per cent to 10.8 per
cent) just about offsets the ten-year de-
crease in the per cent of the p0pula-

under 18. DeSpite the recent upturn
in birth rate there was no child under
6 years of age in 70.5 per cent of the
nation’s families in 1950, and only one
child under 6 in 18.5 per cent of them.
The effects of the high birth rate were
more than offset by the effects of the
high marriage rate and other factors
that tended to increase the number of
households. As a result the average
number of persons per household in
1950 was only 3.39 as compared with
3.67 for 1940 and 4.01 in 1930.
Urban — Rural Communities -— For
the 1950 census a new definition of ur-
ban communities was developed which,
in a word, included some unincorpora-

frum the 1950 CENSUS

tion between 5 and 19 years of age.
The per cent of 20- to 44-year-olds re-
mains substantially unchanged. The
two age groups above 44 show a slight
increase. An upward climb of the me-
dian age for the total population dur-
ing the past 100 years is noted, from
18.8 years in 1850 to 30.1 in 1950.

The figure for life expectancy had
climbed by 1948 to 67.2 years—within
striking distancc of “three-score years
and ten.” Within a decade, the averagc
had pushed upward by nearly 4. years.
The life expectancy for women is about
5.5 years greater than that for men.
Life expectancy for the white popula-
tion is 68 years as compared with 60
years for non-whites.

Time has produced only minor
changes in the pr0portion of the white
and non-white p0pulation. In 1850 the
white p0pulation accounted for 84.3
per cent of the total. By 1900 this
pr0portion had grown to 87.9 per cent.
Since 1920 it has remained virtually
constant at just under 90 per cent.

0f the nation’s nearly forty million
families, about half are families with-
out any children of their own under
18 years of age. One-fifth have onc
own child under 18 years of age; one-
sixth have two own children; only 14.1
per cent have three or more children

ted but densely p0pulated areas that
had heretofore been omitted. Many of
the new urban areas brought in by this
definition are fringe areas or unincor-
porated suburbs of large cities. Almost
two-thirds of the total p0pulation—

more than two-thirds of the pe0ple in
both the West and the Northeast re-

ulation is approximately half of the
nation’s urban p0pulation and nearly a
third of its total inhabitants.

The 1950 census designates 168
“standard metropolitan areas.” Each
such area contains one or more cities
over 50,000 in p0pulation, known as
the “central city” (or cities), and cer-
tain “outlying parts” which are densely
p0pulated and closely integrated in so-
cial and economic matters with the
central city. Growth in the central cit-
ies of the metr0politan areas between
1940 and 1950 was only 13.0 per cent,
but the rate of growth in the outlying
parts was 34.7 per cent. P0pulation
growth in the United States during this
period was largely growth within the
168 metropolitan areas, and nearly
half the p0pulation increase of the en-
tire country took place in the outlying
parts of these areas.

Mobility of Population—During the
seven-year period 1940 to 1947 over
13,000,000 pe0ple moved from one
county to another within their respec-
tive states, and over 12,000,000 crossed
state lines. The Bureau of the Census
has stated that probably never before
in the history of the United States has
there been internal population move-
ment of such magnitude as in the past
eventful years.

In April 1947 more than 4,000,000

one-sixth live on rural farms.

There are now 4,270 urban places of
2,500 inhabitants or more. All but
397 of them are incorporated. The
106 cities over 100,000 in population
constitute only 2.5 per cent of all the
urban places, but their combined pop-

of those who were living on farms had
not lived on farnis in 1940. But, c011-
versely, 7,500,000 persons who were
living on farms in 1940 were no longer
on the farm in 1947. In other words,
between 1940 and 1947 the farm p0p-
ulation showed a net loss from migra-
tion of approximately 3,235,000 per-

553

sons, or approximately 12 per cent of
the 1940 farm population. The similar
net loss between 1930 and 1940 was
only about 2,000,000 persons. Because
of defense industry and other social
and economic factors, the tempo of
movement from farm to city, which was
checked by depression circumstances,
has been accelerated again until it
stands out as one of the important
trends of the past decade.

The center of population for 1950 is
located eight miles northwest of Olncy,
Illinois—some forty miles farther west

than the center of population in 1940.

The Labor Force—1n the 1950 pop-
ulation of more than 150,000,000 per-
sons there were 111,915,000 who were
14 years of age or older—the group
for which labor force statistics are
compiled. Only 53.2 per cent of this,
approximately 59,500,000 persons,
constitute the 1950 labor force. This
number is 12.9 per cent greater than
the total labor force in 1940. Although
the labor force during the past ten
years has increased more rapidly than
the adult population (the population
over 14 years), it has grown a little
less rapidly than the nation's total pOp-
ulation.

The amount of unemployment at the
time of the census enumeration in 1950
was quite low in comparison with that
reported in 1940, a little less than
38,000,000 as compared with 7,500,000.

Technological changes during more
than the past half-century have re-
sulted in marked changes in industrial
and occupational patterns. One of the
major shifts has been an actual de-
crease in the number of agricultural
workers since 1900. Agricultural work-
ers, who in 1900 accounted for nearly
half the entire labor force, now com-
prise only 7,138,000. Manufacturing
has become the largest field. with near-
ly twice the number of workers as are
now engaged in agriculture, and com-
prises a fourth of the entire labor force.
The service industries run fairly close
to manufacturing, with over 12,000,000
workers. Wholesale and retail trade
has grown to the point where it now
employs more than 10,000,000 workers.

As for men engaged in various types
of work in 1950, the largest classes of
workers are: operatives and kindred
workers; craftsmen, foremen. and kin-

554

dred workers; managers, officials and
proprietors other than farm; farmers
and farm managers; and unskilled la-
borers other than farm and mine. For
women the largest classes of workers
are: clerical and kindred workers; op-
eratives and kindred workers; profes-
sional, technical, and kindred workers;
service workers other than in private
households; private household work-
ers; and sales workers.

School Enrolhnents—ln October
1950 the Bureau of the Census re-
ported that sehool enrollment in all
schools and colleges stood at an all-
time high of slightly over 30,000,000
persons 5 to 29 years old. This was
a fifth of the nation’s total population,
and half of the pOpulation between 5
and 29 years of age. The enrollment
in elementary schools reported for the
same date was over 21,000,000 and ac-
counted for 70.5 per cent of the total.
High school enrollments of nearly
6,750,000 accounted for 22.3 per cent,
and college enrollments of more than
2,000,000 for the remaining 7.2 per
cent of the total. More than 900,000
children 5 and 6 years old were in pub-
lie or private kindergartens.

In 1947 there still were 2,750,000
Americans over 14 years of age who
could not read or write in any lan-
guage. Moreover, the per cent of il-
literacy among the non-white popula-
tion was 11.0 per cent as compared
with 2.7 per cent for all adults—and
for the residents of rural farm areas it
was 5.3 per cent. In 194-7 the median
years of school completed was 9.6 as
compared with 8.7 in 194-0.

Implications for Education—1n the
concluding pages of the Research Bul-
letin, a number of basic implications,
which the population facts present for
persons concerned with school plan-
ning, are discussed briefly. lt is pointed
out that an eXpansion of 22 to 30 per
cent in the total capacity of the na-
tion’s elementary-school facilities must
be accomplished within the present
decade. The wave of additional high-
sehool students that will follow is esti-
mated to require an expansion of 25 to
40 per cent in high-school facilities.
with the crest of this second wave
scarcely more than a decade away.
Large scale construction of new school
buildings, therefore, becomes impera-

tive and prompt planning and action
are essential to provide them. Other-
wise, millions of boys and girls will be
denied the advantages of acceptable
schooling.

Other needs include large increases
in school staffs and enlarged expendi-
tures for adequate equipment, facilities
and instruction. ln view of the growth
in life-expectancy the need for adult
education is inevitable. Even the most
effective public school system needs the
supplementary support of a good pub-
lic relations program. Migration into
fringe areas and general nglect of
rural schools present additional prob-
lems. Shifting patterns of occupation
point to the growing importance of the
school’s guidance function.

Finally, the adaption of population
facts to local needs is pointed out as
essential. Each community is advised
to compare the characteristics and
trends of its own population with the
general trends. Suggested questions
are: ls its own pepulation growing
rapidly, or is it reasonably static?
Does it have the problem of serving
immigrants or migrants? ls the birth
rate high or low? \Vhat proportion of
the population is made up of older citi-
zens? Is the school 5 'stem affected by
any sizable amount of rural-urban
migration? How much transiency is
there in the local community; among
what groups; from what region? What
is the local pattern of employment; of
unemployment? \Vhat is the income
level of its people? What part of the
Community’s total inhabitants are
served by the school? Does any age
group have educational needs that the
school system has failed to meet?
Questions such as these must be the
points of departure in local planning.

The statement concludes: “One com-
munity will focus attention on one set
of needs, another on some other prob-
lems. If each has correetly appraised
its own situation, progress will come
where the need is most urgent. There is
no way to plan intelligently for school
improvement except in relation to pre-
vailing social changes, and this implies
an accurate and clear understanding
of significant population trends in the
locality, region. state, and nation."
These comments. largely, are equally
applicable to community recreation.

RECREATION

 

Apropos of the Time Machine*

A special meeting of the parks and
recreation commission in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts, is arranged each year
by Vincent Hebert, superintendent, to
which all living past members are in-
vited. Each ex-member is asked to
reminisce a bit about his own past ex-
periences in parks and recreation work,
to comment on present accomplish-
ments and to outline his views as to
future developments.

Another “Bowl” Game

Not televised or broadcast, but in-
teresting to the residents of Jefferson,
Louisiana, was the first “Cookie Bowl”
football classic between the Jefferson
Doughboys and the Kingsley House
Gingersnaps, held on December 28.
The Doughboys represented the Com-
munity Center and Playground Dis-
trict 5, sponsors of the game, a public
agency which has offered a recreation
program to its community only since
the appointment of its director Dave
Scheuermann in May, 1952. The Gin-
gersnaps were recruited from Kings-
ley House community center, a pri-
vate agency with fifty years of service
to its credit. Members of both teams
were twelve years old or younger-—
maximum weight, ninety-five pounds.
At a preliminary meeting at the play-
ground, with ninety girls—members of
the Funville group—cheerleaders and
pep squads were chosen for both
teams, and a queen and maids of
honor were elected to reign over the
festivities. The trophy awarded to the

winning team was the largest bowl ob-
tainable, filled with all kinds of de-
licious cookies. Cookies were available,
too, for the hundreds of children who
participated in and attended the event.

Archeological Notes

0 Employees of North American Avia-
tion, Incorporated, Inglewood, Cali-
fornia, who are interested in mining
and prOSpecting, may now find com-
panionship with kindred Spirits by
joining the new prospecting club, to
be known as the North American Pros-
pectors. Tentative plans call for an in-
formal organization ——one luncheon
meeting and one field trip a month,
no dues. The field trips will consist of
prOSpecting for gold, lost mines, min-
eral deposits and semi-precious stones.
' Interesting events in the archeo-
logical world have been taking place in
one of the city parks in Rice Lake, Wis-
consin. The state is financing the ex-
cavation of Indian mounds, under the
supervision of the state archeologist
from the University of Wisconsin. Bits
of pottery and weapons found near the
top of the burial chamber have pro-
vided evidence to prove that burials
took place there at least three hundred
years ago. The university feels that
the complete history of the mounds
will be a valuable addition to their re-
search library. A copy of the history
will be presented to the city of Rice
Lake, and a large historical marker will
be placed near the mounds in the park.
Park and recreation oflicials anticipate
that the excavations will attract many
tourists.

Facts and Figures

Sixty acres of hilly, lake-side land,
belonging—with its buildings——to the
city of Shreveport, Louisiana, have
been improved at a cost of $8,000 and
made available, by the recreation de-
partment, to Negro golfers of the city,
as a par thirty-four, public, park golf
course. . . . Private contributions of
$1,500 have made it possible to go
ahead with the development of the
twenty-acre community park in Car-
iisie, Pennsylvania, the plan for which
was drawn five years ago by Alan
Burritt, recently retired from the stafi
of the National Recreation Association.
. . . The office of the recreation de-
partment of Beioit, Wisconsin, is now

located in the new four million dollar
memorial high school, which is de-
signed so that the building may be
used for recreation activities after
school. Facilities include an audi-
torium with stage, a little theatre,
music room, club rooms, visual aid
room, cafeteria, gymnasium with eight
basketball courts. . .' . Sled slides are
being constructed in two or three parks
in Muskegon, Michigan, to replace the
street slides, which have become too
diflicult to operate because of increased
trafiic. . . . Free Christmas trees were
available to churches, schools and or-
phanages in C incinnati, Ohio, when the
Hamilton County Park district found
it necessary to remove pine trees for a
new park road and did it before in-
stead of after Christmas. . . . Over
141,000,000 visits were made in 1952
to New York City’s parks and 584
playgrounds by persons seeking active
recreation, 4,000,000 more than in

1951. The city’s estimated population
is now 8,053,000.

“Foward on Liberty’s Team”

The annual Boy Scout week, Febru-
ary 7 to 14, marks not only the forty-
third birthday of the organization, but
the half-way point of the movement’s
three-year program, under the slogan,
to “help make and keep America physi-
cally strong, mentally awake and mor-
ally straight.” During the past year
two nation-wide projects have been
carried on by the almost three million
members of the Boy Scouts of America
—-a “Get-out-the-Vote” campaign and
a “Blood Donor” campaign. Schools,
civic organizations, churches and other
interested groups may join the Scouts
in observing their anniversary by dis-
playing the 1953 posters, arranging for
scouting exhibits or demonstrations,
or presenting special programs and
films. Assistance and materials may
be secured from local Boy Scout execu-
tives. The third national Jamboree for
more than fifty thousand Scouts and
their leaders will be held on the Irvine
Ranch in southern California, from
July 17-23. Boys from all walks of
life, including representatives from
fifty other lands, will cook their food
over charcoal fires and live in a “city”
of thirty thousand tents—a practical
demonstration of democratic living.

While recrcation boards have long been acknowledged
leaders in the fields of sports, playground activities, and
more recently in sponsoring community concerts and an-
nual displays of fireworks, they have in too many instances
left untouched the great number of students and adults
who are not athlctically inclined. ln Crccnwich, Connecti-
cut, the recreation board, in trying to broaden the scope
of its program, has aided in the development of a group
which is worthy of rather special note, the Greenwich As-
sociation for the Development of Scicntists (C.A.D.S.).

This organization had its beginning in the spring of 19-1-1
when scvcral fourteen-year-old students in Greenwich
banded together to promote their interest in chemistry. At
mcctings every Saturday morning one of them would talk
on some chemical topics such as the theory of solubility, the
chemistry of some element, or some new industrial devclop-
mcnt. They used their mcagcr financial resources to build
up stocks of chemicals and apparatus, and over a period
of time they bought books and magazines not locally avail-
able until they owned a small library. Right aftcr the war
they undertook the manufacture of l).l).T., but before they
got around to selling their product the market price for the

new insecticide dropped and they turned to other activities.
Among them was soillcss growth of tomato plants, study
of chemicals a thousand times sweeter than sugar, and at-
tempts to make pcnicillin chemically. It is interesting to
realize that they managed all this without any adult super-
vision, although they often invited scientists and school
instructors to give talks.

In the eight years since, the C.A.D.S. has grown, its in-
terests have broadened; it has matured, and it has evolved
ideas of real significance.

We know that teachers are often too busy with their
routine obligations to be able to give the special encou-
ragemcnt which is often needed to develop students with
scientific ability. It is this fact which is central to the
reason for the existence of G.A.D.S. Its members seek out
their classmates who express an interest in science and in-
vitc them to join activities designed to arouse a deep cn-
thusiasm for research. Members encourage each other, and
they try to find experts in the community who can help in-
dividuals with special problems on their research projects.
CA.D.S. serves another valuable function, too. It brings
together students who have already started studying sci-
encc on thcir own, and who would ordinarily draw off by
themselves because people their own age would not care
about what they were doing. Far too often in such cases
people of ability havc missed the pcrsonal development
which results from social contacts, and as a result we have
thc type oftcn pictured as the typical scientist: a shy gcnius
at home only with his test tubes.

As anybody knows, a lot of know-how is required if a
grOUp is to accomplish its aims efficiently. C.A.D.S. has
found techniques which are successful in its community.
For one thing, it is vital that an organization: such as this,
if it is to grow, must have adequate facilities for holding
mectings. In the past it could meet in private homes or in

the school during the school year. Now it has members of
high school age, college, and a few graduate student mem-
bers, and since many members are in Greenwich only dur-
ing the summer, the summer program is usually the most
active. The recreation board was approached therefore,
and a plan worked out to enable these young people to use
a community center building. Activities of the group are
of four types.

Lectures—Guest lecturers are invited to give talks once
every month or so. G.A.D.S. also has been fortunate in
finding a number of research laboratories nearby, in addi-
tion to an Audabon center, museums, and a good science
department in the high school.

Education Program—Part of the G.A.D.S. objective in
assisting members in their scientific projects is carried out
through an education program. Subjects of interest to high
school students, which they would have difficulty in learn-
ing themselves, are offered by the college members when
there is sufficient demand. Currently three such courses
are in progress: organic chemistry, calculus, and electron-
ics. Normally students would have to wait until college for
these subjects; however, experience has shown that high
school students with a sincere interest are able to maintain
work on a college level. As a result, a much larger field of
projects is open to students who have completed such
courses in their field of interest, and they are able to enter
college with a superior academic background.

Individual Pro jects—All members are encouraged to un-
dertake projects on their own and report on them to the
membership at regular meetings. The list of accomplish-
ments of individuals is quite varied. Among the chemists
of the group we find one who has discovered a cleaning de-
tergent which is as good as those on the market now, but
without the disadvantage of corroding aluminum parts in
washing machines. Another is developing new methods for
growing crystals of a material, cadmium sulfide, which are
used in electronic equipment. Speaking of electronics,
there is one mcmber who is building a television station.
As you might imagine this would normally involve a vast
outlay of money. He has been able, fortunately, to obtain
the television camera tube, called an orthicon (costing
thousands of dollars new), for free after the tube had been
uscd to the limit of professional use but was still good
enough for amateurs. This same fellow constructed a div»
ing apparatus from a gas mask, rubber hose, and air pump
which has been used in exploration of underwater life to
depths of over forty feet, for periods up-to half an hour.
The landlubbcr biologists have been keeping bee hives.
While one studies nutrition problems of bees another, who
is a talented photographer, takes pictures of bees in flight
so that he can answer questions about this phenomenon.
Still anothcr photographer is using his skill to record the
life and times of tiny microorganisms under the micro-
scope. A meteorologist became interested in the fact that
it often rains heavily right after a flash of lightning, and
to study this he built a cloud chamber and a high voltagc
machine.

Group Projects—Some members have joined together in
group projects combining newly learned theories to serve

FEBRUARY 1953

 

practical purposes. Flowing directly past the community
house where they hold their meetings is the Mianus River
with a problem in pollution. The G.A.D.S. is starting a pro-
gram which will involve investigating this from both a bio-
logical and a chemical angle.

Another group project, now under way, has definite lo-
cal color. About twelve miles from Greenwich, in Bedford,
New York, is an abandoned quarry from which small quan-
tities of uranium minerals can be obtained. The group
constructed a Geiger counter which they use to locate the
general area of uranium concentration. They then return
at night with a home built ultraviolet light which causes
the mineral to fluoresce with a brilliant yellow-green glow.
Having located the uranium exactly, they remove it and
separate it chemically from the mineral. Of course, Green-
wich is in no danger of being atom bombed, since the
actual quantities are small.

While undertaking projects such as these, members of
the G.A.D.S. learn much. Jane Addams, founder of Hull
House in Chicago, had a theory that the best way to learn
a subject was to pursue it as a hobby. Many a self-edu-
cated man will testify to the soundness of this. The
G.A.D.S., with the help of the Greenwich Recreation Board,
has worked on this principle. Should a program such as
theirs be in operation throughout America, the scientific
and inventive future of democracy would be strengthened

—through mass encouragement of men and women to un-
dertake scientific training.

Theory Into Action

Practicing classroom principles and
methods in a community setting is a
privilege of the six professional stu-
dents of George Williams College who
are chosen for the annual fall recrea-
tion tour, sponsored by the Division
of Youth and Community Services of
the Department of Welfare of Spring-
field, lllinois. Under the leadership of
Dr. Harry D. Edgren, professor of
education at the college, the 1952 tour
was conducted from October 16 to 19,
the students demonstrating recreation
programs in nine different communities
and conducting two leadership train-
ing courses. The programs included
skits, singing, arts and crafts, square
dancing, and games and relays with
groups ranging from children in first
and third grades to high school stu-
dents and adults. Five different adult
and youth planning groups were also
aided in evaluating their present pro-
grams and developing plans for the
future. Honored by being chosen for
this sixth annual tour were Joretta
Chermak, Joan Motz, Sue Frost, Ken-
ncth Clarke, Robert Brunkeu and Ollie
Todd.

“Voila Les chmcs”

Undcr this title, songs, dances and
vaudeville skits were presented on De-
cembcr 15 by the Boston University
seniors at the Sargent college of phy-
sical education. An efficient ticket-sell-
ing campaign was waged among stu-
dents, faculty and the public; its aim—
squicient funds to send as many seniors
as possible to the national convention
of the American Association of Health,
Physical Education and Recreation, to
be held in Pittsburgh in April of this

year.

tiou: “Touring the National Parks

with a Park Naturalist,’ at the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati, under J. Herbert
Heger, offers one professional credit.
The eight two-hour lecture sessions
attracted on enrollment in 1952, the
second year of the course, of 162
business and professional people. The
parks are studied from the standpoint
of geological formations, historical
backgrounds, their value as outdoor
laboratories and their available ree-
reational activities. The use of films,
slides, maps, biographical material and
National Park Association literature
supplements the lectures.

“The Fishing Clinic," sponsored by
the University of Tennessee Physical
Education Department, was presented
last June and will probably be repeated
this year. Professor A. W. Hobt con-
ccived the idea and Dr. George F.
Brady arranged the program. It is
believed to be the first in the south to
stress public fishing instruction. With
features of a Sportsman’s show—costs
were borne by exhibitors—the clinic
sessions were devoted to fishing tech-
niques, care of tackle, water safety,
fish propagation and conservation.

Seminar

A three-week seminar in recreation

leadership, sponsored by the YMCA
and Y‘VCA, was conducted at Kansas
State College in December by Frank J.
Annebcrg of Manhattan, Kansas. Par-
ticipating were about fifty students
whose interests lay in recreation leader-
ship in churches, youth groups and
small rural community organizations.

The time—February 4 and 5; the
place—New York City. Five senior
students and one graduate, University
0/ Massachusetts, accompanied by Dr.
William M. Crilnshaw, adviser in rec-
reation education, will be welcomed
at NRA hcadquartcrs, where they plan

to spend most of one day. Interviews
have been scheduled with representa-
tivcs of a number of social agencies,
including the YWCA, Girl Scouts and
Boy Scouts. Visits to several recrea-
tion centers are also on the agenda.

Communn CENTER

This is a continuation of a tour of
the community center to note necessary
minor repairs and alterations which
can be made now to save major repairs
later. Last month’s check list included
(1) windows, (2) curtains, drapes,
shades; (3) pictures, wall hangings,
plaques, and other wall decorations;
(4) light fixtures, lamps, electrical out-
lets, switches, cords; (5) furniture;
and (6) baseboards, moldings, window
ledges, and other woodwork.

l. Waffs. Are there places whcre patch-
ing plaster is needed to fill cracks, nail
holes, and so forth? (Many good, sim-
ple-to-use commercial products for
minor repairs are available on the mar-
ket.) Does paint nced re-touching in
spots? (It’s a good idea to have a
little extra paint mixed and held in re-
serve when an area is painted, to he
used for these repair johs.) Do the
walls need to be dusted or washed? Are
there spots which should be removed?
(Most stains and marks are much easi-
er to remove before they “set”; and
rearranging the furniture occasionally
helps to prevent excessive wear and soil
to wall areas around chairs and divans.)

2. Ceilings. Are ccilings free of cob-
webs, smudges, soot, scaling paint or
loose wallpaper? Are thcre unsightly
and unnecessary wires, metal or wood
stripping. or other superfluous materi-
als which could be removed to improve
the appearance of the ceilings? Have
old decorations been completely re-
moved? Are there stains which signify
a roof or plumbing leak which needs
repair?

3. Doors. Do thcy open and close
easily? Do hinges need oiling? ls
hardware all securely fastened in place?

562

ll0USEKEEPlNG

Do locks work properly and easily?
Are they badly marked or damaged
around the door knobs or frames? (Use
of plastic or metal shields or an extra
coat of paint will protect these areas
and simplify keeping them clean.)

4. Storage Spaces. Is storage space
adequate? (it usually isn’t, but rear-
ranging and adding shelves, putting
things away neatly and compactly, with
seldom used items in the hack or up
high and out of the way, helps to make
the most of the space you do have.) ls
it neat and orderly? Are often-used
items easily accessible? Are shelves,
drawers, racks and bins clearly labclled
to show where all supplies belong? Are
supplies returned to their proper places
as soon as possible after they have
been used? Is an up-to-date inventory
maintained? Is there a special place
for items needing repair? is lighting
adequate? (See “Does Your Stock-
room Pay Dividends?” by Lcrton S.
Krushas in RECREATION, June 1951.)

5. Stairways. Are they kept clean and
constantly free from rubbish or spilled
materials which could cause a safety
hazard? Are they clear of all unneces-
sary materials and equipment which
cause traflic obstructions? Are they
well lighted? Do they have handrails
whcre necessary? Are thcre loose
boards which should he fixed, weak
ones which need reinforcing or re-
placing? Are there non-skid treads
whcre needed? Are they securely
fastened and in good condition?

Bird Feeder

A novel wild bird feeder with an
automatic feed hopper having a ca-
pacity of two pounds is sold through
garden clubs, pet shops, seed stores,
and other retail outlets. Packaged in
an envelope, the [5-2 Fill Wild Bird
Feeder is made of Masonite hard-
board pieces which may be assembled
without fasteners in a few minutes.
The hopper is filled by sliding up the
roof on the wire serving as a hanger.
Designed for long. trouble-free service,
the feeder is manufactured by Green-
field Wood Products, Youngs Creek,
lndiana. It is available in four sizes

Masonry Paint

All masonry surfaces—— including
stucco, cement, huilding blocks, asbes-
tos-cement shingles and brick-wean be
coated in decorator styled colors and
given certified weatherproof protection
with new Sapolin Mason-Uri.

This new rubber based masonry
paint permits full protection against
the destructive elements of lime, alkali
and moisture present in masonry. lts
durable non-lustrous finish keeps ma-

564

sonry surfaces free from stains, streaks
It is able to retain its
full color appearance even in the face
of damp alkali conditions and driving

and mildew.

rains.

Sapolin Mason-Dri contains chemi-
cal properties that prolong the life of
masonry surfaces since it seals against
moisture and freezing. lts insulating
qualities allow a surface to “breath”
sufliciently to permit the escape of ex«
ccssive moisture.

Simple to apply by brush, roller or
spray, Mason-Dri will not crack, peel
or flake even in the face of sharp
temperature changes. Quick drying, it
is available in ready mixed decorator
colors. Special inter-mixtures can be
obtained according to color prefer-
cnces.

Sapolin Mason-Dri is available at
paint, hardware and department stores
everywhere and is manufactured by
Sapolin Paints, Inc., 229 East 42nd
Street, New York City.

1953 Voit Catalog
\V. J. Voit Rubber Corporation has

announced the publication of its new
1953 athletic equipment catalog. The
colorful 32-pagc booklet includes all
of the Voit items for individual and
team sports the year around. There
are several new items, such as the golf
master, a home practice device; the
all rubber putting cup; nose clips in
regular and junior sizes; junior sports
kits of various assortments; and others.
in addition, a number of standard
Voit items have been improved such as
pcbbling and appearance of footballs
and basketballs; stainless stecl hard-
ware on all swim masks and goggles;
a new, improved design on adjustable
swim-fins; a new, casier-to-use Latex

repair unit, and other modifications.

Interested individuals may obtain
copies of this new catalog by writing
to the firm at 1600 East 25th Street,
Los Angelcs 11; 350 West Ontario
Street, Chicago 10; or 251 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 10.

Floor Tennis

A fast, new, competitive sport has
been born and the United States Floor
Tennis Association has copyrighted the
rules and regulations in order to super-
vise and conduct oflicial Floor Tennis
tournaments. Floor Tennis is played
on any floor surface on an 8 by 16
foot court with a 2 foot high net. Base,
side, and center lines are  inch wide,
painted on the floor, or a special plas-
tic type tape developed for this purpose
may be used. A regulation table tennis
ball is used and the bats are slightly
larger and longer than table tennis
racqucls. Table tennis scoring is used
and the play is quite similar; however,
there is a greater chance for an aver-
age player to return hard smashes and
to carry on sustained rallies which
makes the game more interesting.

This game should appeal to schools,
clubs, gyms and social centers since
it can be played on almost any kind of
floor and the minimum of equipment
needed makes it relatively inexpensive.

Tennis. On the right is Dr. ll. A.

RECREATION

Report of Sub-Committee on Placement, National Advisory Committee
on Recruitment, Training, and Placement of Recreation Personnel.

Personnel
Placement

 

R. J. Foval

Members of the Sub-Committee on Placement of Recrea-
tion Personnel met for the first time at the National Recrea-
tion Congress in Seattle and discussed various aspects of
the program. Before that time we had laid the ground
work for this meeting by correspondence. We asked all
members of the committee to make suggestions as to the
most important things that should be studied. We were
warned repeatedly by members of the sub-committee
against duplicating work that had already been done by
the National Recreation Association, American Recreation
Society, colleges and other groups. The thought was ex-
pressed, however, that our committee might bring together
some of the loose ends. We also might be able to complete
and improve upon projects that have been partially done by
other groups.
Suggestions coming from members of the sub-commit-
tee included the following needs:
Certification of recreation personnel.
Up-grading of civil service examinations for recreation
positions.
More complete information regarding job vacancies.
A constant revision and bringing up to date of recreation
standards.
Awards for years of service such as they do in industry.
Closer relations with personnel directors of industry, col-
leges, state recreation associations, municipal oiiicials
and recreation departments.

MR. F OVAL is superintendent of recreation in Decatur, Ill.

FEBRUARY 1953

Other suggestions were made but those above seemed to
be the ones listed most often. The meeting was attended by
nine of the nineteen members of the committee. We were
also able to meet with Dr. Paul Douglass, our general
chairman, John Hutchinson, coordinator, and W. C. Suth-
erland, secretary to the committee. These men helped us
in our thinking. After considerable discussion it was
agreed to start working on the following three projects:

Civil Service: That the civil service departments of the
nation be advised as to the qualifications and the type of
work involved in the various classes of recreation positions.
Prior to contacting the civil service departments it was
suggested that the committee prepare a brief statement as
to the recreation classifications and a guide list of qualifi-
cations pertinent to the recreation field, which could be
used merely as a guide in setting up examinations; that the
attention of the examining authorities should be drawn to
upgrading the placement examination; that resident re-
quirements be removed when possible; and that the exam-
ination include both a written test and an interview.

Dorothea Lensch, director of recreation in Portland,
Oregon, was named chairman of this committee. She has
chosen the following people from the Northwest to work

with her: Willard H. Shumard, Mary F. Quirk, Ben Evans,
Kenneth F owell, Thomas W. Lantz, Carl S. Munson, and
S. C. Witter.

Certification of Recreation Personnel: That the Califor-
nia certification standards be studied in terms of their
adaptability to a national standard. Pauline des Grange,
superintendent of recreation in San Diego, California, was
appointed chairman of this committee with the privilege of
choosing members of her own committee.

Public Relations: That there need to be streamlined bro-
chures for mass distribution on the following: (1) how to
select recreation executives (qualifications, et cetera) ; (2)
the essentials of a good recreation department; (3) how to
select recreation personnel; and (4) recreation policies and
practices. These materials should be made available to
mayors, city recreation boards and others to serve as a
constant reminder that “there are standards” for recreation
personnel. Stuart Richter, superintendent of parks and
recreation in Colorado City, Colorado, was appointed
chairman of this committee with the power to choose mem-
bers of his committee.

The Sub-Committee on Placement of Recreation Person-
nel has received many other suggestions but, for the time
being, feels that it might be well to concentrate on the
above. Placement of recreation personnel covers many
fields. The committee was in agreement that it should move
slowly and be sure of its ground. It is h0ped that within
the next few months this committee will have something
more definite to report. (Continued on page 566.)

TV in California

0 Now in its second year of bringing
craft demonstrations to the homes of
thousands of southern California resi-
dents, is the TV pregraln, “Playcraft-
ers Club.” The telecast, on channel
five. from KTI.A, at 5:00 l'..\t., Monday
through Friday, is presented by five
public recreation agencies in the L0:
Angela: area. in e00pcration with the

the California

Each agency
and school is assigned one complete
daily program. Under L. Arnold Pike,
as coordinator, the programs have pre-
sented cigar box crafts, “Zulu warrior”
cork project, a one-bug zoo, scrap
crafts, printing with potatoes and many
“how-to-makcs,” such as puppet stage,
pocket observatory, table loom, and so
on. 'Other Los Angeles TV and radio
programs were listed in “Taking Ad-
vantage of Television,” in the October,
1951, issue of Recess-nos.

Southern Section of

Teachers Association.

0 Residents of San Mateo, California,
and college students, many with lunch
in hand, attended the World's Series
last fall through the efforts of the rec-
reation department and a local electric
shop. A large TV set was installed in
the grandstand of the city baseball
park. The regular concessionaire dis-
persed hot dogs, peanuts and “Cracker
Jack,” thus creating a true baseball at-
mosphere. Five hundred spectators at-
tended the final game of the series.
Both the recreation department and the
local merchant felt well repaid for their
efforts. In fact, the electric house is
allowing the antenna installation to re-
main to be used for future similar at-
tractions.

Radio in South Carolina

The use of state parks as out-door
classrooms, as well as places of quiet
recreation. is the goal of the Ranger
Parks “school-of-the-air” radio broad-
casts. For the third year, the South
Carolina state parks division is pre-
senting twenty-eight, fifteen-minute,
weekly programs in nature, science,
history and conservation, through ten
radio stations in the state. The setting
for most of the programs is in the state
parks, where the narrator points out
things of interest along the nature
study trails. A special Ranger Parks
teachers’ manual, which supplements
the broadcasts, has been mailed to all
intermediate and junior high schools
in the state. A teacher may obtain a
copy from the State Commission of
Forestry in Columbia.

Recommended Standards
for the Group Care of Children of
Elementary School Age.

Play Schools Association, 119 West
57th Street, New York 19. Pp. 15.
$.25.

A play school program is devised
specifically for children from five to
twelve years of age. In it, the children
are assigned to groups according to
age and emotional maturity, with a
continuity of regular attendance, and
assignment of each child to his own
homeroom and leader.

This small, blue pamphlet, based on
play school experiences throughout
the country, sets certain minimum
standards on program, re uired stall,
staff qualifications, matcriaf and equip-
ment, space, records, work with parents
and families, and health and safety, the
latter including such details as room
temperature, toilet facilities necessary
and amount of lighting needed.

Departments, organizations and
leaders working with children from
five to twelve will wish to become fa-
miliar with these standards, even
though their program may not he in
a play school setting. Certain basic
standards are necessary in any good
program, and these will add to the con-
sidcrable literature now being de-
velopcd on this subject. The Play
Schools Association must he congratu-
latcd on its simple, carefully prepared
statement.——-Virginia Mussclman, Pro-
gram Service, National Recreation As-
sociation.

Covering the

Leisure-time Field

Of special significance is the article
by Dr. N. L. Engelhardt, Sr., describ-
ing the Sunset Community Center of
San Francisco, an outstanding example
of cooperative planning on the part of
school and city authorities. “School
and College Swimming Pools,” by R.
Jackson Smith, is an exceptionally fine
discussion of principles in the design
and construction of indoor pools. The
“Symposium: Cood Maintenance Prac-
tices” affords many suggestions for the
care of recreation buildings and
“Trends in Mufti-Purpose Rooms” like-
wise offers ideas for indoor recreation
facilities. Of major interest is the ar-
ticle. “Facilities for School Camping,”
by George and Louise Donaldson.

Many of the other articles point out
the increasing provision of recreation
facilities in school buildings and the
enlistment of community cooperation
in planning these facilities. These tend-
cncics are especially illustrated in an
article describing the new Negro Ju-
nior High School in Temple, Texas,
which contains a number of features
that are specifically designed to afford
a recreation center for the Negro com-
munity.

The voluminous section describing
various products of interest to school
officials affords a source of information
on a great variety of materials that
are needed in the development and
maintenance of a municipal recreation
system—George D. Butler, Research
Department. National Recreation As-
sociation.

Reereatiou Leadership

Walter L. Stone and Charles C. Stone.
The William-Frederick Press, New
York. Pp. 81. $2.00.

This publication, under father-sou
authorship, is designed to serve as “a
manual of program planning. philoso-
phy, and develoluncnt, and of the skills
of leadership needed in the use of
leisure time that makes for fullness of
life through leisure, and makes for
creative. democratic living.”

The manual begins with an over-all
view of the need for planning for the

leisure of a democratic people and

what should be included in that plan-
ning. It describes the duties of the
recreation leader and the qualities,
skills and techniques required, the
training necessary, and closes with an
over-all view of the field of recreation
and its relation to other fields of hu-
man and social welfare.

The volume contains many valuable
suggestions as to functions, duties and
procedures of recreation leaders, pre-
sents an interesting discussion of the
nature and significance of recreation
and affords much material which
merits study by individuals looking
toward service in the recreation field.
It would be more readable and effec-
tivc, however, if it contained illustra-
tions of the method by which general
principles are applied in specific sit-
uations, or examples affording evi-
dence that the authors were actually
drawing upon their own varied ex-
periences. To a greater extent than
would seem necessary or advisable,
the authors have drawn upon other
sources for their material.

In many respects the purpose of
helping present and potential recrea-
tion leaders has been achieved. One
might question however the validity
of such statements as: “Our most vital
spiritual problem is the problem of
leisure”; “The sehoolroom is devoted
primarily to the study of books”; “The
way society is at the present time,
there is no adequate place for our
youth”; “All important administrative
decisions should be made by the par-
ticipants who are effected"; or of such
comments as: “Recreation should be
social and not discriminatory"; and
“Recreation believes in intelligence"—
to name only a few.

EIGHT THOUSAND weary marines lay be~
sieged at Yudam-ni; three thousand more
were at Hagaru-ri, preparing a hreak-
through to the sea. Guarding a frozen
mountain pass between them, Major
Barber, with only a company, held their
fate in his hands. Encirclement thrcat-
encd him; he was ordered to withdraw.
But he asked permission to stay. and for
iivc zero-cold days the company held the
pass against attack. The Major, hadly
wounded. was carried about on a stretcher
to direct defense. When relief came. only
eighty-four men could walk away. But
Major Barber’s action had been decisive
in saving a division.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
        

“I know.” says Major Barber, “that you
at home realize what hard jobs our sons
and brothers are doing in America's armed
forces. Mayhc you haven’t realized that
you’re helping those men-whenever you
invest in U. 5. Defense Bonds. True. Bonds
are personal financial security for yott. But
they also strengthen our economy-to pro-
duce the good arms and food and medical
care that make our men secure.”
