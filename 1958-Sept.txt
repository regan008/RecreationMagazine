Nature—man’s first and'finest playground

Man has always loved the glories of Nature, for here is home—base; touching it,
he feels safe. Standing in forested mountains, near tumbling waters,
close to the wonder of living things, his heart is lifted and his hopes nurtured.

Thoreau, who found all life‘s meanings beside Walden Pond, would
have loved Wisconsin’s wonderful parks and forests. And you will, too, for
wise conservation has kept the sylvan beauty that entranced Joliet and
Marquette in 1673. You can study ancient Indian rock-carvings, or watch
exciting Indian ceremonials, or perhaps find arrowheads to bring back home.
There are eight thousand lakes for you to swim. in, bass, pike and muskie

to catch, and wild life to watch. There’s camping, and hiking, and a million
trees to sit under and watch the grass grow. "
All men hunger for peace. It is still to be found in Nature. In the

inspiration of cloud and forest, blossom and.star, you will find testimony
to the essential goodness of life —— and the dignity of man.

Folk dance teachers loved them—the 36 folk

dances we issued several years ago—and demanded
more! So . . . we have just added 49 new dances

(from 15 countries not previously represented) to
make up a complete series called the “World of
Folk Dances.” Naturally, complete and illustrated
instructions accompany each dance, so that you
can teach folk dancing even if you’re not an expert.

"The World of Folk Dances” is a graded series—
from the easiest dances to the most diflicult. Within

Have
an
Ulterior
Motive?

'I'HE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD aspect of the recreation move-
ment may well be the effort to develop standard criteria
by which leisure-time programs 1n ay be measured fairly.and
judged objectively. There are two branches to this problem.
One is concerned with the value of recreation in general and
treats such questions as: “Can recreation help diminish
juvenile delinquency?” The other is concerned with the
relative value of specific recreation activities and treats such
practical administrative problems as whether or not a par-
ticular budgetary eXpense is justifiable.

One of the reasonsothis problem of measurement (or evalu-
ation) is misunderstood may stem from confusion in the
minds of some recreation spokesmen. They seem to be say-
ing that recreation has value per se, that the only purpose a
recreation participant needs—in fact, should have—is his
delight in the sheer fun of the activity. They imply that if
he has an ulterior motive, that if he wants to improve his
knowledge or develop his mind or his talent, he is not really
participating in recreation.

This may be a perfectly valid point of view, and it had
much merit in the days when play-—-—and happiness—were
considered sinful somehow. That this viewpoint is out-
moded, however, can readily be seen from the modern
emphasis on growth and creativity in connection with lei-
sure-time activities. In fact, it is not uncommon to find rec-
reation leaders insisting on recreation for the sheer fun of
it in one sentence and following up with a concept of growth
that involves a good deal more.

One can understand why it is necessary to add the growth
concept. Otherwise, it would have to be held that three-
legged races and pie-eating contests are on a par with learn-
ing about nature or playing with a chamber music group.

If the recreation spokesmen of America really believed thi
they would be leading the movement down a dead-end stre

Nevertheless, the idea that participation in a recreati
activity-—-—in any recreation activity-—-is an end in itself di
hard. It is still held by many who do not see where it lea
and it puts recreation leaders in the position of having
evaluate their movement in terms of numbers and nothin
else.

In an analagous manner, recreation leaders are som
times fond of disclaiming any.responsibility for helping
solve community problems such as juvenile delinquenc
Recreation is an end in itself for the community, they sa_
and it should not be justified in terms of helping to allev
ate community problems. It is curious, indeed, that man
recreation spokesmen who applaud the fact that recreati
programs of industry and the armcd forces are justified, i .
terms of increased profits or greater combat efficiency, ahh -
the justification of a community program in terms of i
contribution to juvenile welfare and morale, or, for th

matter, adult welfare. I

The plain fact of the matter is that recreation leaders ar
constantly evaluating recreation programs in terms I
ulterior motives and ends. It is all to the good that they d
but what is harmful is the fact that they keep perpetuati
the fiction that they do not. This seriously hampers tl
search for measurable tests by which a worthwhile pr
gram can be identified.

If the recreation movement is to move ahead, it mu
ahandon the comforting but outworn cloak of pure, u
diluted objectivity. Its spokesmen must stop retreating u
hind the eXplanation that recreation is valuable in a vacuu
when they are asked for goals and standards. Its thinke
must develop a set of realistic criteria by which recreati
systems may be both judged and justified.

Here are some questions that may be helpful in evaluati
recreation programs. What good is the program accox
plishing? What is its influence on the quality of life of t
pe0ple it serves? Is it representative of their culture or a
tagonistic to it? Could a stranger judge the pe0ple by tl
quality of their leisure-time activities? Do the progran
promote group spirit without destroying individuality? l
leaders and participants like each other? Are the progra
raising and improving the level of experience of those wl
participate in them? Are they in good taste? What ski]
should a recreationally literate person have and are th

RECREATI c

ng taught with any degree of success to the people of

community?
"hese are admittedly difficult questions. They cannot be
wered with scientific cxactitude, but this should not
d us to the fact that they can be answered by reasoning

   
   
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
 
 
      
  
  
 
  
   
   
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
   
  
   
  
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
  
  

I-sons with a consistent point of view about recreation.
Ilong as they can be answered reasonably and consis-
tly they can provide us with standards for measurement
evaluation. These are not the only questions which
d to be asked-—and answered. Thinking recreation prac-
ners are bound to have many more.

he process will not be simple. It requires a point__ of
v that is consistent, acceptable, and understood by all.
fortunately, preoccupation with the notion that recrea-
is justified only on its own terms has left many a rec-
' _ ion practitioner without a valid viewpoint. And many
_ those who have such a philosophy are hard put to

'1 less it.
in

ecreation administrators need to consider techniques
equipment. They need to press for bigger budgets,
1 er facilities, more space, more people, and finer equip-
. t. However, they must do so in the light of a realistic
l—an articulated philosophy about what recreation is
what it is supposed to do. Nothing is more pertinent to
I administration of a recreation system. and nothing could
sibly be more helpful to an administrator trying to
a sure what he is doing.

here are three corollaries to this proposition. The first
that recreation educators ought to make sure that the col-
- curricula provide ample material for would-be recrea-
administrators, in order to arrive at an educated point
iew on recreation. (Heads of recreation agencies ought
top pressing colleges to teach so much specialized tech-
e that students never get a chance to come to a satis-
ory understanding of. the aims of recreation.) The lib-
arts and philosophy should loom large in a recreation
or’s course.

ur recreation leaders need to have some solid ideas on
 constitutes the good life and be able to express and
nd those ideas. Above all else in this age of leisure, we
 1 need teachers of the leisure arts, apostles of the abun-
-. spirit——men and women who can assume leadership in
u vilization which knows more leisure time than any other.
' ecreation leaders are not to be equipped for this role,
3. will be?

short, recreation educators must stop thinking of rec-
* ion workers as play leaders or game specialists, long on
niques and short on goals. They must place the re-
king of their philosOphy and purpose, and the eXpres-
i of these, high on the list of requirements for a profes-
al recreationist.

second corollary is the need to expose the public to this
osophy and purpose. As it is now, each segment of the
ic evaluates recreation in terms of its own self-interest.

EMBER 1958

Some of these evaluations are valid; others are not. Politi-
cians think of recreation programs in terms of votes, land-
owners in terms of property values. lndustrialists are con-
cerned about employee turnover and absenteeism when they
subsidize industrial recreation programs. Military leaders
think of morale. Hospital administrators want to hasten
the patient’s recovery.

Many people who are outside the recreation movement are
in positions of power that make it possible for them to in-
fluence recreation programs. When recreation leaders fail
to give such persons a solid understanding of the valid
goals which can be accomplished through properly admin-
istered recreation activities, they leave a vacuum into which
improper goals may be placed. A stubborn insistence on the
thesis that recreation has value in and of itself produces
this kind of vacuum and eventually leads to widespread
misunderstanding about the nature and purpose of recrea-
tion.

The third corollary is that recreation activities should be
designed to promote the realistic objectives that have been
established for them. If the city fathers are worried about
juvenile delinquency, the recreation administrator should
first develop an intelligent case for an expanded recreation
program based upon how it can best function to produce an
environment that would make delinquency less likely. The
next step is to produce programs pointed directly toward
the fulfillment of this goal.* This would be impossible, of
course, unless the recreation director knows his own aims
and objectives, and they are clear-cut.

One final reminder. No point of view is necessarily final
and should ever be frozen. Recreation needs are constantly
changing. No one can afford to stand still. Many years
ago, the doctrine of “play for play’s sake” suited perfectly
the needs of an age when play was considered sinful, the
seventy-hour workweek was standard, and the city’s crowded
tenements robbed men of their souls. It is outmoded today
in a civilization with plenty of time on its hands. The points
of view recreation leaders develop today should be subject
to change tomorrow.

Satisfactory criteria and valid justifications for recreaa
tion programs will never be developed until recreation
leaders arrive at intelligent and expressed outlooks about
recreation itself. First, they must surmount their confusion
over the premise that recreation has value by itself and must
not be connected with any ulterior goal. Next, they must
begin to discuss, to write, to train, to evaluate, and to de-
fend their program in terms of an intelligent point of view.
Recreation students must be given an opportunity to develop
a philosophy. The public must be exposed to the objectives
of its professional recreation administrators. All these
things are essential to the recreation movement and to the
recreation profession-—if, indeed, it wishes to merit recog-
nition as a profession. I

Riflery Program

Sirs:

I have been a very avid reader of
your monthly magazine RECREATION. I
look forward to each copy so very much.
It has given me. much in organizational
and program background. I have been
receiving this for more than six years
and I am now happy that I have some-
thing to contribute.

I am a full-time superintendent of
recreation for the Fairport-Perinton
recreation council which serves the vil-
lage of Fairport and town of Perinton,
New York, and I feel we have a very
unique program here. We run, on Sat-
urday mornings, in cooperation with
the police department and the, Cros-
man Arms Company, a riflery program
for boys and girls from fifth grade up.

It starts in September and ends in
April. The first several weeks are de-
voted completely to instruction, han-
dling the weapon, sighting and safety;
then the competitive shooting begins.
At the end of the shooting season an
annual banquet is held and awards are
given for marksmen, sharpshooters, and
experts according to preset standards.
In our community more than ninety—
five boys and girls meet every Saturday
morning under close supervision.

The uniqueness of the program is its
adaptability to any type of facility that
your needs may cover. For instance,
we have an old barn that has been con-
verted into a teen-age center; by putting
plywood baffles across the windows we
are able to have a twenty-five foot shoot-
ing range where the dance floor is
during the week. The complete setup
takes less then five minutes and [then]
we are ready for our morning program.

You see, the Crosman rifles, operat-
ed by CO: gas and shooting a 22-cal-
iber pellet, are known as Pellguns. They
have all the features of a regular fire-
arm, complete in every detail, except
the actual powder to fire the shot. The
value of this being that you have all
the experience of shooting, adapted to
indoors or any other closed-in area, in

) RECREATION WILL BE WELL repre-
sented at the second annual meeting of
the President’s Citizens Advisory Com-
mittee of the Council on Youth Fitness,
to be held September 8 and 9, at Fort
Ritchie, Maryland. Representatives from

the NRA and ABS, as well as other rec-

reation organizations will attend.

} TIIE EIGHTY-FIFTH CONGRESS PASSED
three pieces of major conservation leg-
islation during its past session, which
will have a definite impact on the pres-
ervation of America’s scenic and natu-
ral resources. They are:

A bill establishing a National Out-
door Recreation Resources Review
Commission to study the outdoor recre-
ation resources of public lands and
other land and water areas of United
States, and for other purposes.

The antibillboard bill, passed in
amended form, which encourages the
stalks to control the erection of bill-
boards along at least two-thirds of the
41,000-mile federal interstate highway
system.

The Engle Bill, designed to put an
end to acquisition of large areas of the
national domain by the armed forces
without specific congressional approv-
al. The new legislation requires such
approval for any transactiOn involving
more than five thousand acres.

} A GENERAL FIELD STAFF MEETING will
take place here at the National Recrea-
tion Association headquarters, starting
September 15 through the week pre-
ceding the Congress. The thirteen dis-

trict representatives from the eight dis-
tricts will attend.

) PART 11 OF THIS ISSUE of RECREA-
TION is the third annual edition of A
Guide to Books on Recreation. Over 800
selected titles from 128 publishers are
listed in the-Guide, including 230 new
listings this year. All listed titlds may be
ordered through NRA’s Rbcreation
Book Center.

) NOTE TO WRITERS for RECREATION:
Starting October 1 no manuscripts will
be returned unless accompanied by a'
self-addressed stamped cnvelope. We’re
terribly sorry to have to do this, but
increased postal rates have made it im-
possible to do otherwise.

) “THROUGH ITS FORESIGIIT the [Na-
tional Recreation] Association ha s
guided American communities toward
a solution of this continuing problem
[growth of leisure time coupled with
population growth] and has helped vast
numbers of our citizens to achieve a
new richness in living.” The foregoin;
is a statement by P. C. Spencer, chair-.
man of the board of the Sinclair Oil:
Corporation. ‘

NRA also receives a special salut
from Sinclair this month in Time,
Newsweek, Saturday Review, Natura
History, National Geographic, Broad
casting, and on the inside front cover
of this issue of RECREATION. The salute
is part of Sinclair’s American Conser-
vation Series, the commendable public
service program, which, in the past, ha
paid tribute to other national service
organizations. Like others in this dis-
tinguished series, the current ad give
a big boost to the cause of conservatio
and recreation.

The Ill and Handicapped

Recreation personnel working with the
ill and handicapped will be interested in

the following articles in this issue: “Can
Recreation Have an Ulterior Motive?”;

“Market News,” with several items useful
in large institutions; and “New Publica-
tions,” with its review of Dr. William
Menninger’s book How You Grow Up;
and, of course, “Hospital Capsules.”

A first: Teachers College of Columbia
University, in cooperation with NRA, is
conducting a seminar in “Recreation for
the Aged 111 and Handicapped,” starting
October 1. For further information about

Governor Meyncr

_ The Congress Countdow

September 22 to 26

“Recreation strides from seaboard to seaboard. . . .’

WELCOME TO ATLANTIC CITY! Rec-
reation covers the nation, in one
giant stride, as it moves from the Pacific
to the Atlantic Ocean this year! Ad-
vances in “know-how” in this field must
be rapid, as recreation enters the space
age and takes its own important place,
in relation to science, the race for edu-
cation, guided missles, bombs, physical
fitness, mental health, and the search
for peace.

Meetings of the 40th National Rec-

reation Congress will therefore be more
challenging than ever; every delegate’s
thinking is needed. The order of the
day will be to Speak up and say your
piece wherever it seems needed. This is
not the time to hold back! oYoung peo-
ple, new to the profession, we mean you,
as well as the more experienced and the
old-timers! Remember that you come
to give as well as to get. . . .

A wide variety of subjects is included

this year (see outline, page 238),
most of them scheduled for an hour-

and-a-half session. A brief presenta-
tion of the problem, or topic, will gen-
erally be followed by a longer-than-
usual period for panel and floor discus-
sion. Every opportunity will be given
for participation by those who have an
idea to offer . . . ideas are invaluable,

and needed. Be brief and to-the-point.

The Congress will also feature an

Institute in Recreation Administration;
its theme this year “Communications
and Public Relations.” Scheduled for
Tuesday and Wednesday, September
23-24, it is limited to those making ad-
vance registration. Inquiries about
this institute should be directed to W.
C. Sutherland, National Recreation As-
sociation, 8 W. 8th Street, New York 11.

Master Sessions

Eleven important master sessions are
scheduled for Tuesday morning and
Thursday afternoon, with meeting time
extended to two and a half hours in
order to allow for more thorough devel-
opment of the subject.

On Tuesday, special opportunity is
provided those people who may wish to
query some of our leading recreators.
The session You Question the Experts is
studded with t0p-flight leaders who
have agreed to discuss informally with
the audience many of the major prob-
lems now being faced by our profes-
sion.

Be sure to look for other activity and
program sessions (see program outline
on page 238). Exciting leadership and
a demonstration have been lined up
for the free diving and underwater
swimming (skin and scuba diving, to
you). Don’t miss the teen-age sessions
if you can help it. . . .

meeting on the planning of attracti
and successful programs for girls a

Thursday evening. Square dancing fol-
lows the general session on Wednesday,

with Richard Pasvolsky calling.

Wednesday afternoon will be held
open for special meetings and to pro-
vide an Opportunity to do Atlantic City
and the neighboring area. The deep-
sea fishing trip is scheduled for 2:00
P.M. Fish are not guaranteed, but you
will see the Atlantic City sky line from
the “front.”

Also, those interested in tradition,
history, and beautiful countryside will
have the Opportunity to see the lower
New Jersey peninsula via Cape May.
This history trip also leaves at 2:00
P. M ., Wednesday, but by bus this time.

Wives are “special,” of course; so
very special events are planned for
them. This year they will have the
chance to put a finger in the pie them-
selves, or, in other words, do their own
choosing. Their first get-together will
be for a kajfe klatsch bright and early
on Monday morning—9:30 to be exact
——when plans for the entire week will
be discussed. Local people will be pres-
ent to suggest a number of interesting
alternatives, so better not miss it, gals!
Wives’ headquarters, for the full time,
will be the Sun Parlor on the mezzanine.

For those wishing to spend the week-
end following the conference in New
York City, special rates are available
Friday and Saturday nights at the Hotel
Commodore and special buses will take
you from Atlantic City to the hotel. A
tour of New York City recreation facili—
ties will take place Saturday 10 A.M. to
1 P.M. Those interested in county park
systems can tour the outstanding Union
County Park System in New Jersey on
Friday afternoon and then proceed to
New York City if they wish.

If you don’t go to New York, a brief
tour will be available to see the new ree-
reation deveIOpments in Philadelphia.
This tour leaves Atlantic City at 2:00
P.M. Friday and terminates at 6 :00 P.M.

will be on your own after this, but easy

lantic City.

Your Congress

No matter what facet of recreation
you represent, you will find it high-
lighted in one of the specific workshOps
or sessions at the Congress. If you are
an administrator, there are at least
twelve sessions dealing with your vari-
ous problems, most particularly “Ad-
ministrative Problems of Chief Execu-

tives.” Board members will be interested
in “Board Members Diseuss Their
Problems,” as will be various types of
supervisory personnel in “Problems of
Supervisors.” Among the many items
to stimulate the volunteer will be the
session on “Using Volunteers Success-
fully.” Many special areas are covered,
such as recreation in churches, eorrec-
tional institutions, hospitals, industry.
This short run-down just gives you
the chance to make up your own sched-
ule ahead of time, so that you will have
some idea of what you want before you
actually set foot in Atlantic City.

Exhibits and Exhibitors

As you make out your Congress
schedule, be sure to include plenty of
time for visiting the exhibits which will
be adding a gay and carnival atmos-
phere to the mezzanine. Some of your
old friends among the exhibitors will be
there to show you the new equipment
added to their lines, and new ones will
want to meet you and introduce you to
their own unique wares. Time out to
discuss new merchandise with trained
representatives of the big companies
and to make face—to-face contact with
them is never wasted and is always pro-
ductive of something interesting. Not
only that, but these exhibitors are fun!
Go to see them early.

THERE ARE certain things that visit-

test of the season, the Surf Fishing
Tournament, takes place September 19
and 21, and can be caught by any dele-
gate who comes to Atlantic City for the
wcekentl preceding the Congress. Check
on this at the Hotel Ambassador as soon
as, or before, you arrive, or at the At-
lantic City Tuna Club, the largest sport-
fishing organization in America. The
latter can be reached by mail if ad-
dressed simply Atlantic City, New Jer-
sey.

Charter boats are available for “out-
side” fishing. Seasoned skippers will
take you out where the tuna, marlin,
blues, bonita. albacore, and dolphins
abound (Septembcr is good for tuna,
bluefish, and game fish), or into the
bays and nearer shore for weakfish,
kingies, bass, croakers, porgies, floun-
der, and other varicties found in local
waters.

An eighteen-hole tournament golf
course, 6,825 yards, par seventy-two, is
available at the Atlantic City Country
Club at Northfield, (five miles from At-

lantic City out Route 40), which is ex-
tending guest privileges to Congress
delegates. This is reached by bus or
car. Take the bus at Virginia Avenue
and the Boardwalk, or check at Con-
gress Information for alternate routes.

Sightseeing by boat can bc arranged
for .at Starn’s Inlet Pier, at the inlet end
of the Atlantic Avenue bus line and the
Boardwalk. You can also rent boats
with outboard motors there.

Excellent restaurants cater to a wide
variety of tastes, and there is dancing
nightly, except Mondays, in the Fjord
Room, among others, at the Hotel Den-
nis, Michigan Avenue and the Board-
walk—about twelve blocks from the
Hotel Ambassador—and also in the
Submarine Room at the Traymore, still
farther down the Boardwalk, at Illinois
Avenue. Pacific Avenue, behind the
Ambassador and parallel to the Board-
walk, affords jitney service.

How Long Is
Your Reach?

Elvira Delany

HOW FAR does your recreation program reach? Does
it merely offer the usual activities for the “nice”
youngster who shows up at your center or facility, behaves
himself and “fits in”? Does it make any attempt to embrace
the coterie hanging out at the local tavern-poolroom, the
corner gang at the drug or candy store? What have you got

for the “shook-up” youngster (and his “beat” older broth- ‘

er) restlessly prowling through your youth center looking
for something that isn’t there and stirring up a “rumble”
because he cannot find he-knows-not-what? Your program

is fine for Sunday School Pete. What about “Diddley B0p”
Buck?

In 1957 some dozen large American cities were em-
ploying “reaching-(rut techniques” as a major factor in
over twenty-five delinquency control programs. The “street-
club” or “corner-group” worker has been approaching these
“unrcachables” where they hang out — the bowling alleys,
jukebox joints, docks, behind the warehouse, down in the
basement or up on the roof, the “social club” in a vacant
store. The worker uses various approaches to effect his
acceptance by the group. Whatever the approach, he needs
all the forces and facilities of the community behind him
and all the help recreation authorities can give.

In order to help the street-club worker help his gang,
recreation programs themselves may have to be “shook up.”
However, recreation directors may discover they are really
receiving more help than they give. According to the New
York City Youth Board report, Reaching the Unreached,
“There are many groups of youngsters who come to the
centers looking for something to do. Very often, it’s trouble.
Many of them don’t know what they want and they don’t
find it unless the group worker ferrets out their needs and
does something about them. . . . There is always the ag-
gressive gang that runs devastatingly through the building
making life miserable for everybody. . . . Many youngsters
come not for the usual program, but really in search for
friendship. They don’t know how to get started with other
kids. The group worker becomes their friend and moves
them closer to others and to the activities they really want.”

All of the community’s battery of social services, includ-
ing recreation, should be trained on the problem of juvenile
delinquency. It is evident that this is a matter for inter-
dependent, interagency cooperation and development. The
recreation director must let the various social agencies know
he is ready and willing to do what he can, that he will, if

How to approach the youngst
whose idea of recreati
is looking for and finding troub

possible, depart from the conventional program and acc
suggestions for activities to reach the “unreachables.”
Generally, the group worker uses some variation on t
approach outlined in the New York City Youth Board
port: “Making contact with gangs can be accomplished

. . the boys thought the workers were ‘cops,’ F
agents, dope peddlers, or social reformers. Actually t
workers made greater movement in terms of gaining a
ceptancc through concrete actions rather than through a
verbal statements. Most often these took the form of hel
ing boys get jobs, coaching teams, passing around cig
ettes, paying for pool, visiting boys in jail, and accompan
ing them to court.”

Maybe the first “social” the street-gang worker mig
help the gang put on would be a “c0ming~out party” f
Mike, fresh out of reform school, but later on the work
might enable “the gangs to organize social clubs, athle
teams, dances and other activities.” The New York Ci
Youth Board reports that through this approach “int
gang conflict has been prevented or mediated, democra
procedures in leadership have been adopted and gangs ha
begun to engage in such constructive activities as athleti
parties, discussions and trips; and through them to lea
new skills and broaden their interests. So far the new pr
ject has not been successful in changing the . . . attitudes t
wards family, church, police, school, and work.”

area-worker or detached-worker) method is not a rece

We combine case-work techniques
and group-work and informal recrea-
tion methods in attempting to resolve
cases. The objective of the HOP is, and
must be, an attempt to adjust cases so
the offenders fit into pr0gram and to
see that it will not be disrupted.

In addition to a supervisor, we have
two playground counselors working
during the summer. It is important to
remember that the basic problem of dis-
cipline and control of the program is in
the hands of the playground staff.

Our function is not social welfare,
nor is it law enforcement; other agen-
cies are set 11p to give service in those
respects. The job of a recreation de-
partment is recreation, to provide good
opportunities for many pe0ple of all
ages. The service of the RGP is to help
bring a problem into focus so that we,
the parents, and all agencies on the case,
and those that should be on the case,
will tend to have the same perspective.

One of the steps in treatment of
severe cases is suspension. A letter giv-

tion is sent to the police. A squad of- ,
ficer calls at the home and gives the
information—reads the letter to the
parents and cautions the person. The
offender is not allowed in the vicinity
of the playground. This has brought
very satisfying results, especially since
the action tends to jell the problem so
that all agencies concerned know better
how they might function in the case.
It is interesting to note that we had only
seven expulsions during last summer.

This program, I believe, has signifi-
cance for all of us working in recrea-
tion. Some of the values are:

0 Play leaders need support from cen-
tral administration. They need to know
whether police, the courts, and the de-
partment are in back of them.

0 Play leaders need more in-service
education, pointed toward proper ap-
proach to problems and methods of
handHng.

0 Play leaders need to know that they,
their personality and their methods,
may tend to precipitate and magnify
problems.

0 All people and all agencies want to
cooperate, generally. If they appear
aloof it is because of heavy loads and
misunderstandings.

o All agencies, including our own, must
spell their functions to others and to

themselves. Frequently our workers do
not know our limitations.

Is this a possible answer to the dan-
gerous activities of the too enthusias-
tically s pace-minded boy rocketeers
who have been causing police great

concern? What is your experience?

“Rocket lands in yard. Police warn youngsters.” This
and similar news items have been appearing with alarming
regularity in newspapers throughout the nation. A widely
circulated newspaper recently started a feature story with
these words, “Millions face a new and growing menace —-
rockets. The peril comes not from any enemy but from
bright, scientific-minded youngsters on whom the nation’s
safety may depend in the years ahead.”

The odds are that youngsters have already fired some
form of homemade rocket in your community. If they
haven’t yet, they will shortly! It is doubtful that, in the
limited history of organized recreation, a techn010gical de-
ve10pment has had such an impact on the imagination or has
offered the potential dangers that amateur rocketry is cur-
rently exerting. It is because of this potential, or more ex-
actly, very real danger, both to the boy and to his com-
munity, that organized recreation should provide the sorely
needed safety direction and adult guidance.

The necessity for such guidance has been recently high-
lighted by the one person who has probably collected more
data than any other individual, in this new, and for the
most part, uncharted field, Captain Bertrand R. Brinley of
the First United States Army Information Section.* (He
will be one of the speakers at the 40th National Recreation
Congress.)

Captain Brinley read, with growing alarm, of accidents
resulting from unsupervised amateur rocketry efforts and
appealed through the public press for all amateur rocketeers
to get in touch with his office. The response and the re-
sultant follow-up revealed:

0 Approximately seventy per cent of the replies were
from teen-agers under fifteen.

o The breakdown is about even between those who real—
ize they are eXperimenting with something dangerous and
those who do not.

0 Virtually no one is concerned about where his rocket
might land when it comes down.

0 Very few groups have received any type of sponsorship
or adult supervision.

As a result, Captain Brinley has issued a strong two-
point warning to young rocketeers: Abandon all eXper-
imentation with propellent substances until the advice and
guidance of a competent and experienced adult over twenty-
five years of age are available; get permission from local
authorities.

Considerably before his warning, in March, 1958, the

Fair Lawn, New Jersey, Recreation Department had re t
nized the need for local direction of this new youth inter
but was delayed by not being able to find the “right” lea
ship. This was discovered in John Gutman, a local sci
teacher.

Immediately, Mr. Gutman and I began to learn what
organizer of such a program must face: since the fiel
so new, no one is sure whether rockets are pyrotechnic
explosives, or what, and consequently all related legal
quirements must be met. In New Jersey, this meant
following legal steps, which may vary from state to st '_

1. Approval of local council to handle and fire exp
mental rockets.

2. Transportation authorization from local fire chief
police chief to obtain pyrotechnic materials, if not obtai
by direct local purchase.

3. State permit for club supervisor to use explosives w
the present state explosives law is revised. At the pre
time, the Bureau of Engineering and Safety of the
Jersey Department of Labor and Industry has informe
that, “This department has established an Explosives Sa
Advisory Committee with wide representation. The func
of this committee is to make a complete revision of the

isting Explosives Law. The draft will allow for r0
experimentation under the supervision of interested ad
who have themselves 'received some training in the ‘
preparation and use of rocket prOpellants.”

It also seemed necessary to include the specific acti
under the municipal liability insurance coverage, which
obtained when safety provisions of club organization 1
made known. The Fair Lawn Club has been organized
cording to the following pattern:

0 Open to students ninth through twelfth grades.

0 Scientifically trained paid club advisor plus two q
fied adult volunteer assistants.

0 Club membership limited to twenty-eight, divided '
four research and deve10pment groups of seven with an 0
boy as group leader.

0 Signed parent permission releases from all memb

o C00peration and supervision of local police chief .
fire chief.

0 Signed membership cards with pledge that: men
will abide by all rules of club; any rocket will be appro
by advisor and inspection committee; firing will be d
only under club adult supervision.

Jersey. He is also a former teacher, coach, Boy Scout e.
utive, and youth center director.

The most encouraglng factor to a person attempting to
unteract the dangers of amateur rocketry through or-
nization and provision of adult supervision is in the

’alth of assistance offered by military, scientific, and in-
strial organizations.

Encouraging and valuable technical help has been given
the military; including both the army and the navy. Par-

- larly noteworthy has been the cooperation of Colonel
rewcry of Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, New Jersey, who

luding Richard Mallet, an industrial engineer-amateur
ronomcr, Theodore Advocat, a pyrotechnics engineer,
10 helped develop a visual tracking device for the Ameri-
r Explorer satellite, and fuels expert Louis Jablansky.

l'The rocket industry, through Raymond Young, president,
F. R. Mayer, public relations supervisor, of Reaction

tors in Denville, New Jersey, has lent invaluable safety
. istance.

*Direct practical experience in amateur rocketry has been
. ined by coordinated efforts with the Keyport, New Jersey,
igh School Applied Science and Rocket Club, under super-
Sor-science teacher Ceorge Burtt. The Fair Lawn Club
5 tcsted one of the earliest models of the first safe com-
larcial model rocket, the Rock-A-Chute, distributed by
odcl Missiles Incorporated.** The Rock-A-Chute, an ill-
’pensive scale model of the Aerobee-Hi rocket that can be
red from almost any site and returned by parachute, has
*cn tested at the \Vhite Sands Proving Ground and pro-
unced safe; so safe in fact that they have recived govern-
nt approval for shipment by regular mail, in standard
.1 pping containers. Orville Carlisle, developer of this
del rocket, has formed a Model Missile Association ded-
ted to the promotion of safe model rocketry.

Another important, anticipated development is the pro-
, sed army program outlined by Captain Brinley. Indica-
ns have been that such a program will include instruction
ns, industrial plant visits, lectures and demonstrations,
. scussion seminars, and, possibly, model rocket contests.
ptain Brinley hopes that such a program “will serve to
courage youngsters to come out of the basement with their
I ojects and oin an organized and supervised group.”

'II An organized amateur rocket group must ultimately face
- e problem, which in highly urban areas can be the most
1' Icult to solve, of finding an adequate site for firing. The

aged rocketeers who think they know all the answers. But,
if not, the following quote from the Institute of Makers of
Explosives should. “In the U. S. there are less than one

hundred people fully qualified to answcr. . . .

While no person presumes to know all the answers, many
of thcm have been covered below in the condensed but
highly valuable list of safety rules, as drafted by Lt. Col.
Charles Parkin of Fort Belvoir, Virginia:

1. Look up the rules, regulations, and laws of your com-
munity: become familiar with them, and obey them.

2. If possible, join a rocket or science club.

3. Always work under adult supervision; and never work
alone.

4. Never handle components or fuels unless you know ig-
nition or Hash temperatures of these compounds, both sepa-
rately and combined.

5. Do not fuel your rocket with explosives, blasting caps,
or black powder.

6. Do not use compounds in fuels that are sensitive to
heat, shock, or friction, such as potassium chlorate, potas-
sium perchlorate, compounds of the picrate, fulrninate, and
iodate families.

7. Do not use matches or time fuses to set off rockets;
use only electricity.

8. Remember: two ounces of fuel are eight times as
strong as one ounce; for comparison purposes the strength
of the fuel incrcases as the cube of the weight.

9. Secure adequate firing ranges.

10. Observe all legal restrictions and, again, work only
under responsible, trained adult guidance.

11. Don’t fire any rocket except in adequate open areas
under physical conditions proven safe.

One of the biggest remaining open questions seems to be,

“How far can a group safely go in the development of orig-
inal fuels?” I

A recreation center illustrates its extended reach . . .

THE TEEN-AGE motorcycle set, in Hol-

bling to cotillion class. Black leather
jackets and motorcycle boots gave way
to white dinner jackets and black ties
when members of the Gold Coast Motor-
cycle Club strutted at their first annual
ball July 9. They did it up royally,
down to white gloves, waltzes, and re-
ceiving lines. Cyclists thronged the
Thursday night cotillion clases at the
teen center, taught by Eileen Wall of the
recreation department. Manners as well
as dance steps got a thorough going
over.

The “how not to be a slob” course,
so named by its rough-and-tumble par-
ticipants met with enthusiastic response
from the thirty-five Gold Coasters and
the eighteen members of their girls’
auxiliary. The boys found dancing
tougher exercise than scrambling but
they took it in stride.

Miami Herald, M ay 29, 1958.

“Takes guts to dance,” remarked one
sideliner at the first Thursday class.
Five minutes later he staunchly stum-
bled through a mixer. “Say, these pol-
ishing classes are all right,” exclaimed
another.

The Gold Coasters haven-’t traded in
their cycles on patent leather dancing
pumps. Far from it, the club, an afiili-
ate of the American Motorcycle Asso-
ciation, still sponsors Sunday afternoon
“scrambles,” and sends contenders to
motorcycle road races and scrambles
throughout the state. The cotillion clas-
ses are one more step in their effort to
round out club members and make them
acceptable community citizens.

“We’re not lunatics on wheels out to
kill ourselves and everyone else,” says
auxiliary secretary June Warren, “and
we’re going to prove it.”

The club has come a long way since
its founding last year. It was formed as
an antidote to the “Screwballs,” an out-
law motorcycle squad, since disbanded,
who rumbled and racketed through

Hollywood’s streets. “A bunch of idiot
can spoil it for everyone else that rides,”
says Gold Coaster Leo Sorel. “Lots 0
screwballs are now club members,” says
Gold Coast Bud
Treaster. “All they needed was a chanc

recognition.”

The path to public approval has been
rougher than many a road race. “We
kicked out twenty-six guys in a two-
month stretch,” says nineteen-year-old
Joe Treaster. “We want members who’ll
work for the good of the club. . . .”

ln April, Gold Coasters turned out en
masse for a Red Cross first-aid course.
They’ve made it a policy to lend a hand
to motorists in trouble.

As for the ball, it took a little selling.
Miss Phyllis Dewey, of the recreation
department, and Treaster talked it up
among the members. But after the first

class, the race was on. “We’ll be regu- '

lar Marge and Gower Champions by the
time we’re through,” says Joe. “We’re

THERE IS AN EVER-PRESENT, fast-growing need for youth
and adults to work together in a genuinely cooperative
manner to ensure the success of youth activities, whether it
be on a city youth council, a teen-age council, a recreation
council, or for a school dance or private party. One of the
most essential and yet sensitive areas of cooperation in-
volves the adult relationships with junior and senior high
school youths in planning and chaperoning parties and
dances. We are concerned with this tOpic, here, particularly
as related to those held in schools and various youth recrea-
tion centers. The Special problems of such large-scale affairs
require special methods, although some of the techniques“
will be recognized as universally suitable.

Chaperone Chairman

Every party for young people has an adult party chair-
man, of course. To supplement her responsibilities and
services, there should also be a chaperone chairman, who
should be familiar with the following rules and procedures.

1. Visit the party site prior to the party, to become ac-
quainted with the physical layout of the building and learn
of any special regulations.

2. Plan an orientation meeting with the chaperones be-

fore the night of the party to discuss chaperoning in general'

and to distribute a list of written instructions applying to
your specific party. This should include (a) conduct rules
for the teen-agers (the chaperones should also follow these
rules), (b) the chaperones’ assigned positions, and any ad-
ditional building regulations.

IA helpful way to prepare chaperones for situations that
might arise at the party is to have some of the parents as-
sume the role of chaperone and other teen-agers at this
orientation meeting. Then act out situations such as that
of teen-agers’ trying to leave the party early, gate-crashers’
trying to get in, and so on.

3. Specify that only those attending the orientation meet-
ing will be permitted to chaperone the party.

and Chiaperoning Teen-Age Dances, from which this article is con-
densed, write Recreation Commission, City Hall Annex, 1835 Allston

Way, Berkeley, California. $.10.

246

For parties such as this one at a junior
high school in Long Beach, California,
chaperones must understand their roles.

4. If varying ethnic groups are included, this should be
reflected in the choice of chaperones.

5. Discuss with the party committee the possible need
for additional help. An experienced recreation director may
be needed, and under some circumstances, it may be a good|
idea to obtain the services of an auxiliary policeman. In
any event, the committee should check to find out if there
is a local ordinance requiring the police department to be
informed of the date, time, and place of the party.

6. Familiarize yourself and your chaperones with any
local teen-age discipline problems that might occur at a
party, and their cause. It is possible to avoid an unpleasan
incident if we are familiar with and watch for warnin :
signs and do something preventive about it.

7. Ask the chaperones to arrive at the party early, fo
last minute instructions. If they, as well as the recreation
leaders, police (if used), and youth leaders clearly under
stand the operation and what part they are expected to play
the event will run more smoothly.

8. Make certain that the chaperones are easily identified
Name tags should include the word “chaperone,” as we]
as the chaperone’s name.

9. Use one of the chaperone stations as an informati01
center and place to receive and deliver messages.

10. Make yourself readily accessible to your chaperone
so you can answer their questions and they can recciv
help with problems they cannot handle alone. Two way
of doing this are by circulating throughout the entire eve
ning and by assigning two chaperones to each post so tha
you will not need to circulate but can remain at a centra
information station. Thus, one chaperone can come to yo
for help without leaving her post uncovered.

11. Plan a rotating system for the evening, which _wi
give each chaperone a turn at the more pleasant location

12. Make certain that recreation directors are used in .
leadership capacity, not as chaperones.

13. Have husbands and wives chaperone at the sam

party whenever possible. This imparts a team feeling.

14. Assign two men to one post if you have enough chap-
erones. Inexperienced male chaperones seem more at ease

this way.

15. Have the entrance covered, by men, if possible, to
avoid party crashing. “ '

16. See that the restrooms are supervised and checked
periodically because drinking may occur there.

17. Make certain that a chaperone is stationed at the top
or bottom of stairs to avoid “running” accidents.

18. Have, whenever possible, a chaperone or director,
prepared with ideas to revive the party if it is falling on its
face and you are asked to help pep it up. These must be
teen-age approved “pepper-uppers,” of course.

19. Check with the party chairman before the party to
see that a car, first-aid supplies, and a telephone are readily
Iavailable for emergency use.

20. Have on hand a few pins, a needle and thread, bobby
pins, and such, for use in minor crises.

21. Have the area outside of the building checked from
time to time. This should be well lighted.

22. Plan with the party committee to see that the party
I attcndants have means of going home, if that is your respon-

kibili'ty.

and that you understand your evening’s responsibility.

4. Take your station, no matter how boring it may seem,
and stay there until relieved by another chaperone. If the
party is going well there may be little to do, but if you leavc
your post uncovered this may be just the time an incident
will occur.

5. Put yourself in the role of a friendly volunteer helper.

6. Refrain from discussing with each other or with the
young people the participants’ appearance or conduct.

7. Enjoy chaperone visiting, but not at the expense of
covering your post properly.

8. Refrain from drinking before chaperoning a teen-age
party.

9. Dress appropriately, making certain not to overdress.
Let this be your child’s show, not yours.

10. Know that it may be acutely embarrassing to your
teen-agers if you try to be “one of the gang” or act anything
but what they consider your age.

11. Remember that the teen-ager you know as an indi-
vidual may not appear to be the same teen-ager in a situation
with his own age group.

12. Know and follow through on the rules about letting
young guests leave the party early.

13. Appear calm. Remember that youth delights in
shocking those who seem to shock easily.

14. Let the teen-age dance committee take care of as
many of the party problems as possible. This will not be
too difficult for them if rules about smoking, drinking,
rowdiness, smooching in dark corners, cursing, suggestive
dancing, and so on have been decided upon in advance of
the party, by the youth-adult party committee, and are un-
derstood by the party-goers.

15. Take care of each situation as it arises. If you don’t
feel experienced enough to handle an incident,'don’t hesi-
tate to get help from the chaperone chairman, party chair-
man, a policeman, or a committee set up for the specific
purpose of coping with problems.

16. Have the positive attitude that you are there to help

the teen-agers have a successful party—not to prevent ex-
pected trouble.

1?. Remember how important your tone of voice can be
when you are confronted with an incident. Be objective,
direct, and understanding. A humorous approach is some-
times fruitful and may put the offender at ease. In any case
he should understand that you are only an interested parent
who wants to help!

18. Try to avoid scenes, no matter how serious an offense
may be. In a positive, pleasant manner try to remove the
offender to a place where he may be dealt with privately.

19, Understand that younger teen-agers attending a
dance sometimes prefer talking and watching until they gain
coniidencc. After this, they will take the next step and
participate in thc dancing.

20. Most important of all, consider it a privilege to see
young people in action and to know what is going on in
this area of your teen-ager’s life. Some adults never have
the fun of attending a well-run, happy party. (Cong, next page)

The interest of many teen-age boys shifts from sports
to mechanics and their desire to explore the latter field
results in a new and stimulating program activity.

6‘.

When teen-agers drop out of our programs, whose fault
is it, theirs or ours? Perhaps one reason is that we do not
offer them sufficient opportunity to work with their hands
and with their hearts. These programs show the degree of
interest and work they will give when they accept a challenge
that interests them. Mr. Herdic reports another special
activity, a radio club, has been going successfully for six
months. In it, the boys collect old radios, strip them for
parts, and then learn to build their own from scratch. Per-
haps the hey lies in these three programs—special interest
groups, limited in size, but unlimited in personal chal-

Take My Hand

fl‘HE-PROBLEM of teen-agers and their willingness to be

helpful to the community has been a topic of discussion
many times.

Here in Manchester, a high-school student volunteer
group spends two hours each week helping handicapped
childrcn to swim. This outstanding group of teen-agers has
formed a swimming instructors club, calling itself Instruct-
ors of Handicapped, working directly with the recreation
department. Each Saturday afternoon throughout the win-
ter months, for four years, these boys and girls have volun-
teered their time to work with less fortunate children. There
is a lot more to this program, too, than just giving their
time, as each handicapped child must be handled a different

way. There are many problems to cope with, such as fe
of the water, strange surroundings, and the fact that
parents are permitted in the pool during the swimming c l I
riod. Therefore, these young instructors must gain t
confidence of the child before he can begin to accompli '
anything in the water.

After the instructor gains the child’s confidence, whi
may take a week or two, depending on the individual,
takes him into the water. He then works with this child f
the entire swim period, lasting approximately forty-ii
minutes.

The progress of each child is recorded at the end of t
month, and a report made to the superintendent of recr
tion and to the child’s parents. An example of the progr
being made with these children by the teen-agers is the bli
boy who, at the beginning of this program two years a
could not swim a stroke. Today, he not only swims, usi
the various strokes, but has mastered the art of jumpi
from the low board. (See photograph on opposite page.)

In other cases the progress of the child has been a l
slower; for instance, a little girl who had polio has 0
got to ducking her head. This in itself is progress, ho
ever, because, when she came into the pool last N ovemb
she was extremely shy and chary of even entering the wat

of his mechanics to instruct the boys and supervise the
activity. The chief mechanic stated that he was extremely
interested and would be available one night a week.

He suggested instruction on the various automobile parts
before we let the boys work on their own cars and make a
lot of mistakes. The recreation department then started the
club, which had to be limited to twenty-five boys because
of lack of space and tools. It wasn’t very long before the
quota was filled.

The instructor met with the boys, along with the program
director from the recreation department, who did all the
organization work for this activity, and eXplained just how
the club was to operate and what was expected of them when
they brought their cars to the garage. Following the or-
ganizational meeting, the instructor covered many subjects,
using movies and a mechanic’s handbook for illustrations.
The following parts of the car were covered: fuel, brakes,
cooling and electrical system, front end, engine.

Following instruction in these subjects, which lasted four
weeks, the boys were told to bring their cars into the garage
on the following Wednesday evening between 7 :00 and 9:00.
The group has been meeting every week since February
1957 with the exception of the summer months—with sur-
prising results. The boys have been using the tools, belong-
ing to the garage and the mechanic himself, and have not
lost or damaged any.

The recreation department staff feels that this is ex-
tremely worth while, as the club reaches a group of boys
with a specialized interest, who would not be reached by
any other recreation activities.

exciting recreation developments 'growing out of a
community awareness of local recreation needs and citizen
c’ooperation to meet them. All of these cannot be reported
individually, for there are too many and, anyway, one of the
thrilling things about them is that they are no longer unique
but rather the order of the day. However, we will try to
tell the story of some of the more ingenious or interesting,
such as the following, from time to time.

Transformation of “Sumps”

In one of the most unique parks and recreation projects
in the country, the city of El Segundo, California, has been
Husily transforming unsightly flood-control sumps into use-
ful, landscaped playground areas.

Called “Parkettes,” the first of these play areas has been
completed recently. Instead of an eyesore, the neighbor-
hood now has a playground facility and extended backyard
area, of which all residents can well be proud. Actually

 

Unsightly flood-control “sumps” are transformed into playground areas in El Segundo,
California. These drainage pits are rectangular basins up to twelve feet in depth.

this facility combines a landscaped activity center with the
usefulness of an emergency storm basin.

El Segundo is a hilly town without adequate storm drain
facilities. In order to retard flooding “of developed sections,
several sumps have been installed in key low areas. These
vary in size from one-third acre to one acre. The sumps are
rectangular basins up to twelve feet in depth. In each case,
percolating wells have been drilled to facilitate drainage.
All areas are fenced as a safeguard against accidental
drownings.

About a year ago, city oHicials decided that they created
quite a community eyesore. Property values were affected

252

 

in areas immediately adjacent. After further study th
city decided to attempt to beautify and utilize these do
mant and unsightly areas. Now, although the primary pu
pose of these areas is still flood control, the projects hav
been madc of dual value to the community during the re
maining 335 days.

Surprisingly, the additional cost of converting a sump t
a “Parkette” is approximately $2,000. This figure include
all materials for sprinkling system, landscaping, and play
ground apparatus. The recreation and park departmen
furnished the labor.

In addition to “Sycamore Parkette,” already completed,
the city is now in the process of converting three other
flood-control projects into Parkettes.

El Segundo City Council voiced the opinion that this
was a unique multi-use of emergency facilities. “I believe
this may attract national attention,” stated Mayor Kenneth
R. Benlield, “and I expect other municipalities with dormant
areas as these, may follow El Segundo’s lead in converting'

 

unsightly sumps into areas of usefulness and beauty.”
KEITH E. KELLY, Director, Recreation and Parks Depart
ment, El Segundo.

Recreation “Rolls”

In 1955, a handful of citizens from Antelope Valley, lo-
cated eighty-four miles north of Los Angeles, handed to-

gether for the purpose of organ1z1ng a survey and appraisal

in the valley and at the same time to appraise the existin
program. With the cooperation of specialists from the L0

e California State Recreation Commission, groundwork
as laid for the currently existing mobile recreation unit
Antelope Valley.

Community groups from the school districts located in
- e valley were asked to send representatives from their
' ganizatibns to work with the Citizens Recreation Survey
1d Appraisal Committee of Northern Los Angeles County.
One of the most significant results of the survey was the
iscovery of the need for recreation in the rural areas 10-
.-~. ted as far as twenty-eight miles east, southwest and south-
- st from Lancaster. Because of financial and personncl
imitations, four trailer courts located seven miles from
ncaster, the communities of Juniper Hills and Acton, lo-
' ted, respectively, twenty-six miles southeast and southwest
om Lancaster, were chosen for this unique plan of bring-
g supervised recreation by means of a mobile recreation
lit.

This offer of county monies to provide opportunities for
creation activities using private facilities is wholly with-
_t precedent. The matter was referred to county counsel.

- ruled that the department could use private facilities
ovided:

1'1. Written permission be obtained from owner.
2. Program and area were open to to all in the community.
eetings were held with the trailer court owners and the
' ’omen’s clubs in Juniper Hills and Acton, whose faeilities

. .ere the only ones available in the community.

The planned program offered to these groups prompted
exceedingly enthusiastic response. Immediately, permis-

"on for the county to use the facilities was granted.
fA survey of children in the trailer courts was made and
I owed an average of sixty-eight children from preschool
. teen age who eagerly seized this opportunity for recrea-
kn activities. In Acton the survey showed 102 children

I-

, r 1 From Pets to Petting

and in Juniper Hills forty-seven children who would benefit
by this program.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved
this unprccedented policy and instructed Norman S. John-
son, director of the Los Angeles County Department of
Parks and Recreation, to initiate this program beginning
in July, 1957.

At once the wheels began to turn; specialists within the
department framework met as a unit to plan the all-round
recreation program. The transportation division made avail-
able a station wagon that would be manned by specialists.
The mobile unit earried recreation supplies, such as bats,
balls, craft kits, and table games. In addition, the recrea-
tion leaders were able to utilize such recreation facilities
as might be available in the location visited. Some of the
trailer courts have recreation buildings and swimming pools.

The program offered such activities as table games, games
of low organization, dancing, dramatics, handcrafts, and
group games. In each area of operation the mothers or-
ganized themselves into volunteer leaders, assisting with the
program. Committees were chosen to assume the respon-
sibility for providing refreshments for the children.

In each instance the trailer court owners and community
leaders expressed a desire to cooperate in every way pos-
sible, ineluding plans for the construction of additional
facilities in order to enhance and enlarge the recreation
program.

From the interest of a small group of civic-minded people.
and with the cooperation of county government and pri-
vate enterprise, this vitally needed program has mushroom-
ed into a successful reality that will provide carry-over
value for the participants into later life.-—MARVIN BASS,

Recreation, Los Angeles County.

National Recreation Trends

 

 

HE PROPORTIONS and complexity
Tof our national recreation and lei-
sure-time movement demand more and
better teamwork at the front line. Some
relatively new, noteworthy patterns
of such COOperative endeavor are evi-
dent in the recreation developments and
trends during 1957. If one needs any
reminder that our national problem of
recreation and leisure today is one of
expanding and complex proportions,
just glance at the list of innumerable
organizations—public and private, pro-
fessional and nonprofessional, local,
state, and national—acutely concerned
with this over-all problem. As a bit of
additional evidence, 2,580 cities, towns,
townships and counties, and districts
were registered with the National Rec-
reation Association for field service at
the close of last year. During 1957, 103
new local public recreation depart-
ments were reported, and in fifty-nine
of these a full-time, year-round superin-
tendent was employed for the first time.
Ninety-four of the 103 communities
have new boards and commissions to
administer parks and recreation. In the
remaining nine, the administering au-
thority is the city manager, in five in-
stances, the local schodl body in the
other four.

Localities in thirty-nine different
states report forty-one types of new rec-
reation and park facilities constructed
or acquired during the past year. We
know this is only a portion of the total
of acquisitions nationally. Leading the
list are new playgrounds, parks, swim-
ming pools, recreation buildings, and
field and shelter houses, with a notice-
able eXpansion of facilities in the ex-
traurban and fringe areas. These are
making definite forward strides
through annexation of neighborhoods
and communities, acquisition of new
sites for schools, and the establishment
of new city, township, and district rec-
reation and park jurisdictions. Expan-

sion of local recreation budgets con-
tinues the trend of the past six years.
There were few local losses in 1957.

Such expansion of new facilities in
recent years brought country-wide in-
creases in program volume again in
1957. In general, its quality improved
over previous years, yet a few states did
not make top showing. Another evi-
dence of recreation’s expansion is the
fact that, during 1957, NRA District
fieldworkers consulted with fifty-five
colleges and universities concerned
with the recruiting, training, and place-
ment of professional recration leaders.

Let us look briefly at the work of the
eight National Recreation Association
District Advisory Committees. These
committees are appointed to advise the
district representatives in determining
the recreation needs in each district and
how the Association’s resources can
best be utilized to help these people. In
1957, these committees had the most
active year since their organization.
Altogether they discussed seventeen dif-
ferent kinds of projects and problems.
These cight committees represent an-
other valuable type of cooperative plan-
ning and action. I shall mention what
is being done, at this time, by only one
committee; namely, the National Ad-
visory Committee on Recreation Ad-
ministration. Its function is to study
current problems of concern to recrea-
tion and park administrators and to
make results of the study available to
leaders of the national movement. The
sixty-three members of the committee
and other administrators have been ac-
tive in contributing information on dif-
ferent subjects through subcommittees.
Some of this information has appeared
in RECREATION Magazine but it is all
available and is being utilized by the
Association in answering inquiries con-
cerning such problems.

Currently, the committee is at work
on five important problems, each in the
hands of a subcommittee. One of these
has to do with liability faced by recre-
ation and park departments. The sub-

committee, chaired by Don Dyer, s
perintendent of recreation and ad

education in Milwaukee, which studi
this problem, has submitted its repo
entitled “Liability in Public Recreati
and Accident Insurance.”

A second subcommittee is at work a
the problem “School-City C00pcrati
in the Planning of Recreation Are
and Facilities.” Jay M. Ver Lee,
perintendent of recreation in Oaklan
California, is subcommittee chairma
Another studyi

committee is gathering information 0

Jersey. The most recently appoint
subcommittee is starting work on t

subcommittee is

problem of “Encroachments on Pub
Recreation and Park Areas,” with D
Sinn, superintendent of recreation
Flint, Michigan, as chairman.

These questions have been suggest
largely by recreation and park admin
trators. Some of them have come fr
the discussions of the recreation exe
tives in their special session at the 
reation Congress each year. As y
know, there is a National Advis
Council composed of the chairman
each of the eight District Advis
Committees, the president of each st
recreation society or association, a
the chairman of each National Ad vis -
Committee.

The National Recreation Associat'
is giving increasing time and thou ;
through its field and headquart
workers, to all of these efforts on
local, state, and national levels beca
the Association feels it is important
do so, and because the big task we
face cannot be accomplished with
close cooperation and team effort.

Use of Financial Aid

Because proposals have been made from time to time for
bsidizing local recreation services with state, school, or
| er local funds, Warren H. Tappin, Jr.’s doctoral study
r the University of Washington, A Study of an Experiment
_ the Use of School Subsidies to Promote Community Rec-
tion Programs in the State of Washington, is worth read-
-.-; It appraises sixty-six community recreation programs
'lizing financial aid granted to local school districts in
ashington state. Major findings are:

ministrative authority. The local school district assumed
dership in community recreation programs throughout
- state-aid years. However, with the discontinuance of
te aid in 1950, it greatly reduced its administrative re-
onsibilities and no other local agency took over the
dership.

' anciai basis. The grants-in-aid program succeeded in
'ming communities to spend more to support their pro-
alns. This process carried over into the post state-aid era
the first-class districts. Second- and third-class districts,
rthe other hand, spent in 1953 only slightly more than
e-fourth the amount spent in 1950.

adership personnel. Leadership standards were lowered
ing the state-aid period; in the first-class districts they
re higher than those in the second- and third-class dis-
cts in 1946 and 1950. Despite the drastic cut in leader-
p personnel in second- and third-class districts, they pos-
- ed higher qualifications in 1953 than did the first-class
trict.

'cilities used. All but the federal agencies provided more
ilities in 1950 than in 1946, but in 1953 all but the
. nty agencies provided fewer than in 1950. I,

ogram services. The scope of activities was broadened in
' districts during state-aid years. In 1953, however, more
' four of every five communities in the second- and third-
88 districts either had no program or confined them to
' or two activities. Only one first-class district dropped
program.

ogram participation. Although an increase in attendance
over 300,000 was registered between 1946 and 1950, the
n-age group and the girls seem to have been neglected
- all district programs. In 1953 the first-class districts
re attracting more peOple and a wider age spread, while
‘ '- others confined their services mainly to nine- and ten-

r-old boys.

The completed 1958 student and cur-
'culum inventory indicates the down-
_ ard trend has at least stopped and
.-rhaps reversed in recruiting of rec-
ation students. The study was spon-
red by the National Recreation As-
ciation’s Undergraduate and Gradu-
e Education Committees, chaired by
i'. rs. Harlan Metcalf and John Hutchin-
on respectively. In addition to the
ommittee members we are indebted to
l mes Orles, a graduate student work-
lg on his master’s degree under the
upervision of Dr. Hutchinson at Col-
. bia University. Mr. Orles did the
bles, making it possible to give you
is advancc summary. We hope the
mmittees bring out a detailed report.

Sixty-one colleges and universities
swered the questionnaire. The 683
creation graduates reported this year
present an increase of 277 candidates
ver 1957. The total current recreation
rollment is reported at 2,298. Recrea-
on space is going to waste, however,

could train 3,678 students, capacity
could be increased to 5,700 by adding
a few more faculty members. This is
about 3,400 more than are now en-
rolled. With some reasonable increase
in both faculty and facilities, capacity
could be expanded to about 7,000 ac-
cording to recent reports.

The study also revealed what appears
to be‘a considerable increase in corres-
pondence and extension courses.

The total of recreation students enter-

W. C. Sutherland

ing the profession last year was some-
what better than first predicted. The
largest number of graduates, 235, en-
tered community recreation positions
last year. The next largest group, sixty-
nine, went into hospital and institution
work, and another seventy-one joined
the staffs of voluntary youth-serving
organizations. Of those not taking pro-
fessional recreation positions, seventy-
five went into.military service and fifty
remained for graduate work.

0 TwinWeld Cold Solder is a new type of plastic adhesive
with tremendous gripping power. When the solder is spread
between two surfaces, a plastic reaction, caused by heat,
occurs, altering its make-up, and links the’facing surfaces
into a permanent bond, which is hard, durable, and has a
steel-like surface. It can be sanded, painted, and finished
like steel, and is easy to cut, handle, and shape. TwinWeld
can be used between such dissimilar surfaces as: wood and
metal, metal and glass, and also adheres firmly to cement
without keying. It remains workable for several hours, has a
long pot life, and can be cured under a heat lamp in about
five minutes. For details, write Schramm Fiberglass Prod-

ucts, 3010 West Montrose Avenue, Chicago 10.

'i‘ Congress sessions on the ill and

handicapped start with “Recreation—A
Positive Force in Preventive Medi-
cine”; and continue with the following
program: “How to Use Recreation Ac-
tivities as a Therapeutic Tool”; “A Re-
port on the Study of Recreation in Hos-
pitals,” a study heing conducted by the
National Recreation Association; “New
Concepts in Recruitment and Education
of Personnel Working with the Ill and
Handicapped”; “Demonstrations of
Recreation Techniques for the Mentally
Retarded”; “Techniques of Observa-
tion and Reporting on Patient Behav-
ior”; “Deve10ping Programs Around
Life Patterns and Social Customs of
Patients in Institutions for the Aged.”
Following this will he an interesting
demonstration of community resources
available nationally for recreation in
hospitals and related institutions. The
closing session will be of tremendous
importance to all of us: “Cooperative
Planning for the Handicapped — Joint
Responsibility of the Community and
the Institution.”

*i‘ I think you will be interested to know
that we have two projects—one in New
York City, the other in Hartford, Con-
necticut— going full speed right now,
promoting recreation in nursing homes,
of which there are 25,000 in the United
States; less than a handful provide any
type of organized recreation activity
for their patients. It is quite unbeliev-
able but these patients are awakened at
seven-thirty in the morning, left in bed
or put in a chair next to the bed, just
to sit, staring at the wall, from morning
till evening with ahsolutely nothing to
do. Nursing homes have had little in-
doctrination or education concerning
the very positive value of recreation
and, as a group, they fear the cost of
recreation would be too high for them.
The NRA hopes to diSprove this idea.

We are demonstrating that one worker

can be jointly employed by three homes,

NEW BOOKS FOR THE CAMPER

On. Your Own in the Wilderness, Town-
send Whelen and Bradford Angier.

Stackpole Company, Harrisburg, Penn-
sylvania. Pp. 324. $5.00.

The publisher calls this a “guide to
peace and utter freedom.” The authors
give essential information about out-
fits, equipment, travel in the wilderness,
pitching camp, and all essential camp-
craft —— even cooking —-——- along with
some philos0phy of the out-of—doors.

Their style conveys the lure of the wild-
erness trail.

Nature Is Your Guide,” Harold Gatty.
E. P. Dutton and Company, 300 Fourth
Avenue, New York City 16. Pp. 287.
$4.95.

The fascinating art of pathfinding
o’er land or sea is told in nontechnical
language, so that the veriest beginner
can learn something. It is a fascinating
story, with history woven in. Valuable
clues as to one’s whereabouts can be
picked up, for instance, from birds,
sand driven by the wind, trces and
other plants, reflections in the sky, the
stars, and many other natural signposts.
Outdoor groups and recreation and
camp leaders should have this on their
reference shelves.

The New Way of the Wilderness,” Cal-
vin Rutstrum. Macmillan Company, 60
Fifth Avenue, New York City 11. Pp.
276. $4.50.

Another publication, this time writ-
ten by the owner of a wilderness out-
fitting company on the Canadian bor-
der, is designed to enable anyone to
prepare for a successful wilderness our-
ney without confusion. Up-to-date
equipment and methods are featured.
Pack horse trips are covered, as are
canoe travel and procedure, “go-light-
auto-camping,” and winter travel by
dag team. Illustrations are helpful.

PUBLICATIONS

Corering (he Leisure-lime Field

This is a picture book of the spec—
tacular scenery in our national parks
and should be in the kit of anyone
planning a vacation trip. Thirty-three
full-color photographs are interspersed
with 494 black-and-whites, each with
a caption. Text is at a minimum and
deals with important features of various
sections of the country, accessibility
and accommodations.

Camping and Outdoor Cooking

Rae Oetting and Mabel Otis Robi-
son. T. S. Denison and Co... 321 Fifth

Avenue South, Minneapolis 15. Pp.
259. $4.95.

This is a practical guide to all sorts
of good things to eat—those that can be
cooked over a campfire or packed in a
picnic basket— and is an attractive
book as well. Photographs of camp-
sites, fires, and camp food stir the ap-
petite, and humorous drawings add
color and fun. The chapter on “Foil
Cooking” introduces some ingenious
ideas for simple ways of preparing a de-
licious meal. Roasts, biscuits, and other
equally ambitious dishes are now with-
in the reach of the inexperienced out-
door cook, and their preparation is as
easy as falling off a log. Suggestions
for a “survival kit” are also included.

Among other subjects covered are:
dehydrated foods, cooking of wild
game, shellfish, sauces, with a section
“for dippers and dunkers,” barbecuing,
picnics. In this day of the outdoor bar-
becue pit, garden grill and so on, this
would make an ideal gift for your week-
end host or hostess.

How You Grow Up

William C. Menninger, M.D. Ster—
ling Publishing Co., 419 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 16. Pp. 187. $2.95.

This is written to the boy or girl ap-
proaching adolescence, by some of the
outstanding psychologists and physi-
cians in the country and gives the an-
swers to many of the problems of grow-
ing up. The child’s feelings, appear-
ance, physical development, getting
along with parents, life with brothers,
sisters, and friends are treated in a
readable and enjoyable way. Amusing
drawings point up the heart of each
