LETTERS

 

OPEN LETTER TO HENRY DAVID THOREAU

Dear Henry:
While Henry David Thoreau is a

member of this publication’s editorial
staf)I in spirit only, we are happy to be
the recipient of the following “Open
Letter to Henry David Thoreau”:

Dear Henry:

Ever since I’ve heard about your
book Walden, in which you described
your experiences along the shores of
Walden Pond, Where you claim you
“got closer to nature,” I’ve had an ir-
resistible urge to “get closer to nature”
myself. I said, “If Henry can do it, so
can I!” As a result, I went to a lake
that I heard about.

I have found that the problem you
described is even more applicable to my
generation than it was to yours. There
are jet-propelled airplanes that travel
faster than the Speed of sound; there
are rockets that are so powerful that
they can overcome the pressure of the
earth’s atmosphere and orbit around the
earth in space; there are atom bombs
that have the potential of destroying
every living creature on earth.

I drove down to the sporting goods
store to buy some equipment in prep-
aration for my journey to the lake. I
bought an axe, a beautiful spun-glass
fishing rod, a spinning reel, special line
and leader that the salesman said I
would need for my spinning reel, and
a few fluorescent lures that were guar-
anteed to catch fish. You probably won’t
believe this, but the equipment totaled
around seventy-five dollars. I wouldn’t
have obtained such a good buy if the
store hadn’t been having a “sale.”

After three hours of “fighting” the
city trafiic, I put my car into “low drive”
and started my ascent into the moun-
tains. Soon the sun started shining. I
could not see the city below because it
was smothered in a thick layer of smog.
Smog, Henry, is caused by industrial
progress which is responsible for “more
comfortable living.” The children in
cities of today don’t know about such
things as fresh air.

After a while I arrived at the lake.
I had an awful time finding a parking
place, the area was so crowded. After
looking around for a while, I started
chopping down a tree for the log cabin
I was going to build and live in. Be-
fore I had the tree chopped down, a
warden came along and fined me fifty
dollars for destroying a reserve area.

I obtained a room for the night at a

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

lodge along the lake’s edge. A bell-boy
carried my bags upstairs to the room.
He continually thrust his palm toward
me for a tip. At first, I didn’t know
what he wanted, so I shook hands with
him. Nowadays, to get anywhere in so-
ciety-—~—or the “wilderness”——one “tips”
twenty percent of his bill.

That evening I went downstairs to get
something to eat. I was told that I
would have to call room service. I went
back upstairs and gave room service my
order. Room service, in turn, gave the
cook my order. Room service paid the
cook for my food, and I paid room
service a profit for serving it to me. It
seems to be impossible to dispense with
the “middleman” nowadays, Henry.
It’s even against the lodge rules for a
person to deal directly with the bar-
tender. A customer orders a drink from
a barmaid who orders it from the bar-
tender who sells it to the barmaid who
sells it to the customer standing next to
her.

The next day I decided I’d put on a
swimming suit and go to sleep on the
sandy beach while I got a suntan. I no
sooner closed my eyes when a loud
shriek pierced my ears. “You’re not go-
ing to throw me into that cold water,
you beast,” a shapely brunette said to
the “Romeo” who was chasing her.
They ran around me five times before
he caught her, and I ended up with a
mouth full of sand. The loud noise of
a jet—propelled airplane flying overhead
discouraged me from trying to get any
more sleep.

After getting dressed, I rented a
motorboat and went fishing. It was ex-
tremely difficult to keep from running
into the many other boats on the lake.
The spinning reel makes it possible for
me to cast my line out several yards.

After several hours, I felt my first
nibble. I started reeling my line in. The
fish must have just started biting at that
particular time because the man in the
boat a few hundred feet away from me

also appeared to be catching a fish. As
we reeled in, our boats slowly drifted to-
gether. Finally, both lines simultane-
ously popped out of the water and be-
came taut between the boats. It was one
awful tangle, Henry.

One night a dance took place at the
lodge. There was a bright moon that
night, so I decided to sneak away from
civilization and take a walk on a trail.
However, on the trail I received dirty
looks from teenage couples who had

RECREATION

 

also sneaked away from the dance.
There seemed to be more civilization on
the trail than in the lodge.

I am now in the hospital, Henry, re-
cuperating from my outina. The doctor
says after I am released, I will have to
undergo psychiatric treatment.

I estimate the total cost of my outing,
including doctor bills, to be about
$5,000. _It is worth it, though. I came
about as close as one can get to nature
in this day and age.

Help Appreciated

Sirs:

I have appreciated all the help I have
received this year through the National
Recreation Association’s Correspond-
ence and Consultation Department and
also from the Consulting Service on
Recreation for the Ill and Handicapped.
I gain a great deal from the magazine
and the newsletters.

Morale Breakdown

Sirs:

I hope someday to return to America
again to enjoy some of the recreation
facilities described in “On the Military
Front” in the December issue. Sadly,
however, it does not mention the equal
number of bases woefully neglected,
especially in the Pacific and European
theaters I have been in. To indicate
typical gross deficiencies now existing,
take, for instance, a base with ten thou-
sand personnel and dependents on
which I now serve in Libya:

0 No gymnasium or exercise facilities.
SBX program has failed and been modi-
fied.

0 Swimming pool near the ocean open
only four months a year in a California-
like climate.

0 Beach unusable from late October
through March because of seaweed up
to three feet deep.

0 No hunting because we cannot carry
arms.

0 Eight bowling alleys in disrepair. \Ve
are triple charged in the town.

0 Military shows and acts never come
here from Europe.

0 Four tennis courts in very poor con-
dition.

0 Three planes in an aero club, two of
which are usually being repaired.

o Exorbitant rents and charges for sub-
standard housing must be met before we
can think of spending money for recre-
ation while the government has 350
empty trailers.

On Page 487 of the same issue, Colo-
nel Blair has admirable ideals and were

he to come to this base he would be
assured of how correct he is in the
breakdown of morale, physical ability,
military readiness, and respect ten thou-
sand disgusted and neglected poor rep-
resentatives of America can undergo.

Msc'r. M. SPANGLER, USAFE, Wheel-
us AFB, Libya.

Indoor Hockey

Sirs:

Two years ago, we started to build
a program of indoor hockey games as
a new way to combine genuine recrea-
tion with the physical development so
badly needed by school children every—

 

1"

where in the United States. We wanted
to give them an activity they would fully
enjoy so they would take an enthusias-
tic part. We developed the game of in-
door hockey because it could be played
in any gymnasium; it could be played
with lightweight plastic sticks and plas-
tic pucks, so play could be fast and
strenuous and still be safe; it afforded
the smaller and younger children a new
opportunity to participate in a ,sport on
equal terms with larger and older chil-
dren; equipment was simple and inex—
pensive.

The success of our idea is indicated
by the participation of forty-three teams

PETER? \

What should a modern camp
offer today’s child?

Kenneth B. Webb

 

GUEST EDITORIAL

 

implies that he has a certain new set of needs besides

the age-old needs of childhood. A good modern camp,
like any other educational institution which is sensitive to
the passing scene and flexible enough to adapt to it, must
give its children what they need. This is not always-“the same
as what they want or what they think they want.

“What, no TV in the whole camp? No radio or even
electricity in the cabins?” a new camper asked in dismay,
having evidently ignored the omission of any reference to
these gadgets in the camp booklet, “Then what are we going
to do with ourselves?” This particular camper found himself
so busy in the next few weeks, so challenged by activities
and values he never knew existed, that he had no time for
the doubtful blessings of TV. Furthermore, he went home
with a whole new set of interests which converted his leisure
time from passive to active.

In a readable study of today’s educational needs, entitled
Camping for American Y outh~A Declaration for Action,
the American Camping Association lists a dozen unhappy
conditions faced by youth as a result of urbanization. Among
these are tension, crowding, pressures to conformity, fear,
the fragmentation of life, the deterioration of moral and
spiritual values, and the disappearance of work as fulfill-
ment. Perceptive parents are increasingly aware of these
dangers to the growth of a well-rounded, secure individual.

“What can we do with Peter?” a boy’s parents wrote.
“He has a yen for some good, rugged living close to naturp
and the simple, challenging things that used to make boygs
strong and self-reliant. Our own feeling is that boys don"t
want to be entertained all the time. They want to feel they
are doing something themselves, something that makes them
feel useful and needed—therefore, secure as new indi-
viduals.”

About the best answer to such a letter is, “Send your bof.
or girl to a good Wilderness camp where he or she can ting
the essential supplements to the shortcomings of a city en-
vironment.” For We must face it: City life is definitely not
made for children. It is not geared to their needs. It is not
natural to them. The lack of contact with the soil, the want
of experience with the free life of the woods and fields where
a youngster can run and ump and climb and swim—where
on his own he can meet the challenge of sun and wind and
rain—this lack can warp a new life conditioned through
eons of race experience to depend on certain factors for
growth. All one can say is that it is striking testimony to
the adaptability of the human organism that the strains and
stresses of such an unnatural environment have not caused
worse warping than they have. The wonder is that so many
youngsters can still grow up sweet and wholesome. But even
these can profit by what a modern camp has to offer.

TODAY’S CHILD is probably a child of suburbia. This

ETER’S parents found a camp which, like many others
P today, set out to give their boys the challenge they need.
Peter discovered there were coveted hikes and canoe trips
one could take when he could swim competently, manage

a canoe with sufficient skill, build a fire in the rain, and
pick a satisfactory spot for sleeping on the trail. Acquiring
these skills assumed an importance which called forth effort
the boy had seldom exerted before.

Peter found out that the youngsters at this camp were a
remarkably self-reliant, self-confident crew. When they
wanted a new dock in front of their cabin, they built it. When
the logged-up steps in the path to the waterfront began to
break down, they replaced them with new steps better than
the others had ever been. They learned to saw and hammer
and chop. They got interested in extending a horse pasture
and fencing in a new area for some colts. The camp bought
the wire, but the older boys hauled the posts from the woods
to location, barked them, and creosoted the butts. These kids
seemed always to beteaming up to undertake some project
to improve their living or to benefit the camp.

Along with all this physical activity, which included
vigorous baseball games and hotly contested soccer matches
as well, the camp was giving these youngsters, all unknown
to them, some other benefits lacking in the homogeneous
structure of suburbia. At camp, Peter found boys from many
parts of the country, from other economic strata, and from
different racial groups. He learned the democratic lesson of
the richness and the strength which other ethnic groups
could contribute, the stimulation to one’s thoughts and one’s
attitudes that contact with campers from other regions can
bring. Several local boys at camp on full scholarship opened
up to Peter a whole new way of looking at things. All the
boys were too absorbed in enterprises the camp managed
to challenge them with to find time for quarreling or feeling
put upon. So they learned to live together.

HEN Peter returned home, his parents found the boy

had gained not just a healthy tan and great physical
vigor. There was also a subtle difference in the boy’s hear-
ing, something about the way he carried himself, and the
quiet manner in which he spoke. It was a new confidence,
a new self-awareness, a new security. This evident sense of
security was the most striking change. Peter’s parents had
realized the devastating influence on a young life of the
self-destruction, the fear, the insecurity which seems in some
form or other to beset many urban youngsters.

To the perceptive parent the effect of a modern camp on
younger boys and girls is just as apparent. Such camps restore
to these youngsters their birthright, of which city living can
deprive them. I can think of no better way to put this matter
of a child’s birthright than I did years ago in Summer
Magic:

“The good brown earth, sun-steeped meadows where the
bob-o-link sings; trails that go winding up through hemlock
ridges; the 'dip of trim canoes breasting the waters of some
forest-rimmed lake; the keen zest of strife in an evenly
matched game, the rush of an arrow before it strikes treni-
hling in the target; the way a calf nuzzles your hand, thel
contented twitter of little chicks foraging with a mother
hen; lashing rain on a mountainside, the sharpness of the
breeze at dawn; the aroma of sizzling bacon flavored with
just a bit of ash and perhaps a pine needle or two—these

are all part of a youngster’s rightful heritage.” #

AS WE GO TO PRESS

 

b STAN IS THE MAN. New director of
physical fitness for the nation is Stan
Musial, famed Cardinal outfielder, who
retired as an active player at the end

Of last season. He replaces Charles B.

(Bud) Wilkinson on the President’s
Council on Physical Fitness. Mr. Wil-
kinson has resigned as director of ath-
letics and football coach at the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma and from the council
to run for Congress.

I t ON THE CULTURAL FRONT. Roger L.

Stevens, New York theatrical producer,
i has been selected to organize and direct
the Johnson Administration’s cultural
program. Mr. Stevens’ designation was
strongly recommended by a four-man
panel recently organized by President
Johnson to advise him on carrying for-
ward the cultural program. Although
best known as a producer of classical
and contemporary theater in New York
and other major American cities, Mr.
Stevens is also a successful real-estate
broker and a prominent figure in the
Democratic Party.

In the new White House post pro-
posed by President Johnson’s informal
advisory group, Mr. Stevens will enjoy
greater authority than his predecessor,
August Heckscher, who resigned to re-
sume his position as director of the
Twentieth Century Fund. Together with
his resignation, he submitted an eighty-
page report criticizing the slow pace of
the government’s cultural efforts.

) JUST OUT. A new booklet by the U.S.
Bureau of Outdoor Education, Federal
Assistance in Outdoor Recreation, sum-
marizes federal programs which pro-
vide outdoor recreation assistance to

viduals and organizations. Types of as-
sistance involved are credit, cost-shar-
ing. technical aid, educational services,

tion on the programs of the Depart-
ments of the Interior, Agriculture, Com-
merce, Defense, and Health, Education
and Welfare, and such independent
agencies as the General Services Ad-
ministration, Housing and Home Fi-
nance Agency. Small Business Adminis-
tration, and Tennessee Valley Author-
ity. The publication is available from

Conference on School Recreation held
in November 1962, entitled Twentieth
Century Recreation—Re-engagement of
School and Community, has just been
published by the American Association
for Health, Physical Education and Rec-
reation. Every recreation executive
should read this and keep it handy, for
it discusses at length the role of the
school in recreation and municipal-
school recreation programs. It gives the
recommendations of the conference and
has a section on “new concepts of rec-
reation.” The Pasadena Coordinated
Recreation Plan for School-City Recre-
ation is given in a chart in the appendix,
along with the Milwaukee Contractural

Agreement between the Common Coun-

Oil and the Board of School Directors.

) HONORINC PIONEERS. Mrs. Louis Tish-
man of New York City received the
first Ollie A. Randall Award from the
National Council on the Aging at its
13th annual meeting in Chicago. The
award was created this year by the
council, “To give recognition to indi-
viduals who have made singular contri-
butions to the well-being of older peo-
ple and interpreting the council’s phil-
osophy of enabling the older person to
live a dignified, healthier, happier and
more productiVe life.” Mrs. Tishman
won the award for her work with day-
center programs, notably with the Wil-
liam Hodson Community Center in the
Bronx, New York, and as a pioneer in
making vacation services available for
Older people. She has advanced and en-
couraged professional training in work
with the aging, aided volunteers’ coop-
eration with government agencies in
the New York area and was instrumen-
tal in developing an educational pro-
gram that brought better understanding
Of the capacities and potentials Of Older
people.

in terms Of people as well as of land
and wildlife.

“The motion-picture camera is a po-
tent weapon,” says The Times. “It’s a
tool that could be more profitably used
by conservation organizations, by gov-
ernment, and by those with resources
to whom the spoiled lands, fouled wa-
ter, and declining acreage for fish and
wildlife are a negative phenomenon of
man that conservation in its truest sense
will help rectify.”

The title of the film is The Pond and

RECREATIQN

Letters to Editor

on an organized league playing schcd-
ule which culminated in an all-star game
between the league champions and a
team of all stars on April 6, 1963. Thirty
of these teams were in the recreation de-
partment program. Thirteen more teams
were organized in unior high schools

of Battle Creek.

By the autumn of 1963, nine more
Michigan towns had ordered equipment
to start indoor hockey leagues in their
school systems. In the Battle Creek Rec-
reation Department program, teams
were allowed to carry twelve players
and league play took place over a ten-
week period. Games were played on
Saturday, starting at 9 :OOAM and finish-
ing at 9:00PM. Forty-five minutes were
allowed for each game. Teams, in addi-
tion to the thirty in the recreation pro-
gram, had to be turned away, as Satur-
day was the only day available.

Much of the credit for the success
of this activity goes to the coaches,
principals, athletic directors, parents,
and others who cooperated enthusias-
tically. Physical education teachers
were very helpful. We visited schools,
taught the game to the teachers, and left
a set of equipment for a week or
ten days. Once the physical-education
teacher understood the game and used
it in gym classes, it was relatively easy
to organize a league under the direction
of the recreation department.

Since there are only four general
playing rules, the game can be taught
in fifteen minutes or less. There are six
players: a goalkeeper, a center, two
guards, and two forwards. The game is
played in three periods of eight minutes
each, with five-minute rest periods be-
tween. Play is continuous unless a goal
is scored or a roughing foul is called.
The game is highly active; yet the pos-
sibilty of injury is very slight. During
120 hours of league play, involving
forty-two teams, there was not one in-
jury necessitating medical care.

At the same time the smaller players
ften became outstanding players as
'ndoor hockey is not dominated by tall,
or heavy, players. In fact, one boy who
weighted slightly more than a hundred
pounds was chosen as an all-star center
over a second boy who was nearly six
feet tall and an outstanding basketball
layer. The all-star goalie was only
five feet, four inches tall and weighed
nore than 160 pounds. Another excel-
lent goalie is unable to run because of
he aftereifects of polio, and another
0y who has a hook in place of one
land was a very good player. Girls en-
'oy indoor hockey also and there again
be smaller players can compete on

equal terms with taller and larger
students.

Once a league is organized, the di-
rector will find promotional activities
beneficial. We found it effective to
award trophies to winning teams, to
select all-star players and to make all-
star awards, to publish weekly results,
listing all high scorers and outstanding
performances and to complete the
league schedule with an all-star game.

In short, indoor hockey lends itself to
the well-established practices of varsity
sports, thus creating and sustaining
greater interest. Yet it is a game that
can be widely played, that attracts a
large number of young people who can
not play on varsity teams, that gives
them vigorous exercise and that causes
them to participate voluntarily and
enthusiastically.

The equipment used is the Cosom
Safe-T-Play Hockey Kit with the hockey
sticks modified by running a half-inch
diameter wooden dowel the full length
of the stick and a one-inch rubber furni-
ture tip over the end of the stick to hold
the dowel in place. Sticks thus equipped
are so durable we found a set of twelve
sticks is enough for a league of fifteen
to twenty teams with only one or two
extra sticks in reserve. We recommend
that goalies wear the plastic eyeguards
generally used for basketball players
who wear eyeglasses. The total cost of
equipment for a league of fifteen to
twenty teams is only about $30.00 plus
the plastic face masks for the goalies.

Water is a key factor in camping. Only with the most care-
ful planning will it be possible to maintain an adequate
supply of water for recreation and future camping needs.

Time out for mail from home. To meet the camping needs
of the present and future generations we must have land in
pr0per locations with potential for dwell-rounded program.

We must place camping in its proper recreation context
with art, music, drama, dance, nature, sports, and special
events. Camping fills a need and void in today’s leisure.

 

ACTION

Dana E. Harlow

AMPING, like other gamuts within the recreation move-
C ment, was born of Yankee ingenuity. The Great Ponds
Act of 1641 advocated forever “free fishing and fowl-
ing on all ponds over ten acres in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Joseph Lee’s “sand gardens” of Boston in the
late 1800’s established the playground movement. Camping
was a “Yankee notion” in 1861, and, even up to 1923,
ninety-three percent of the camps of the nation were still
in New England.

In looking at camping, we should not divorce it from the
broad picture of recreation but understand it as a facet of
recreation interests and realize that recreation, through
which most of our leisure is spent, is a fundamantal phase

 
   
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
   
  
   
   
  
   

of living. We must place camping in context with art, music,
drama, dance, nature, sports, special events, and linguistics,
assess its relative merit or value, and from this gain a per-
spective for the future. Only from this view can we plan
intelligently for camping needs. Camping then fills this void
in leisure and the picture of camping, along with the other
recreation pursuits of mankind in a more abundant leisure,
is changing.

To assure present and future generations outdoor recre-
ation opportunities of adequate quantity and quality, more
effective management of land and water resources and more
careful planning are urgently needed. The management of
these camping resources is a basic factor in expanding the
supply of future opportunities. The term “management” is
used here to include the overall policy, planning, design of
recreation development at all levels of organization as well
as the operational aspects of administration.

There is a changing trend in recreation and camping.
Recreation embraces a wide range of interests and activities.
It is highly diversified, and, within recent years, this diver-
sification of interests has been exceptionally pronounced.
While all of us are concerned with children and children’s

Twentieth century challenges to camping

 

camps, does it make sense to close a camp after eight weeks
when schools, agencies, and the like are looking for just
this thing—a facility for outdoor leisure? To close a camp
after eight weeks is similar to closing a school at 3PM when
it is bought and paid for by the taxdollar and supported
by the public, and the youngster has ended up with the
world’s longest playground—the city street, if that. Essen-
tial leadership then is the key word. Leadership that under-
stands there are opportunities other than just eight weeks—
or from 8AM until 3PM. Leadership with imagination, an
imagination that will subscribe to the ideas of small boys
or an old man.

ODAY, as never before, camping in the United States is

faced with challenges that must be met, changes in
concept that must be accepted if we are to keep pace with
the expanding leisure and recreation needs of a nation. To
meet these challenges effectively new knowledge must be
gained, trends must be identified, issues and problems must
be examined and analyzed, new methods and techniques
developed and, Where necessary, existing concepts modified
and changed. Every recreator, camping enthusiast, layman.
board member, committee member, camp administrator and
civic leader should concern himself with this and bear a
responsibility in this process.

The conventional approach of providing outdoor recre-
ation is not adequate for present needs, and it will certainly
not be adequate for the future. To underscore this point,
let us review briefly the facts of demands and supply:

0 First, the demand is large and it is growing. Not only are
there more people but, individually, they are seeking the
outdoors at a growing rate, and they are likely to do so
even more in the coming decades.

0 Second, the kind of recreation people want most of all
is relatively simple—a path to walk along, an attractive
road to drive along, a place to swim, a shady hillside for a
picnic, and a chance to see open skies and green grass. This
is a heritage we must preserve for the future.

0 Third, the dollar—whether it comes from a tax, public,
charitable, or philanthropic source is immaterial, it still
comes from somewhere. As the society in which we live

109

demands that recreation pursuits be socially acceptable, it
is then society’s nonexclusive right to sponsor, promote, and
furnish recreation. The dollar must stretch. It must bend and
it must turn corners, but it must be effective.

0 Fourth, pe0ple want these things where they live—wand
where most people live is in our growing metropolitan areas.

0 Fifth, we are not running out of land. We are falling
short of using it effectively. The physical supply of land and
water for recreation is bountiful; for reasons of ownership,
management, or location, access to it is not. We must effec-
tively manage what we have or what we can acquire.

OMPREHENSIVE planning will protect against those par-
C ticular groups who seriously believe that a swimming
pool here or a nature museum there is the only solution to
a camp program. It will cause people to think twice before
they spend thousands of dollars for the construction of a
dam across a stream, that in a few short years will become
polluted from upstream sewers or “peach orchard plumb-
ing.” It will point out that such a pool, dam, museum, or
what-have-you can only be justified on the basis of diversi-
fied activities for the total camp picture and to meet the
camping needs of the present and future generations. Then,
after the design is finished—geared to a priority schedule
of needs coupled with interests and money—one can truth-
fully ask: Is it functional? Does it meet in a practical way
the full requirements of the problem? Has it considered the
problem of supervision, administration, and control? The
advantage of comprehensive planning should be obvious:

0 First, we can have land in proper locations with potential
for a well-rounded program and it will be there ready for
development when our expanding population requires it.
W’e will not be forced to buy an over-priced, second-rate
area at the last moment.

0 Second, when we are ready to develop an area either on
an immediate or long-range basis, advanced planning will
prevent costly mistakes. It can reduce construction and
maintenance costs. It can assure efficient operation. It can
provide maximum and effective use.

0 Third, the layout of any area is simply the interpretation
of a program geared to the potentials of the site. No two
areas are alike. They differ in size, shape, topography, na-
tural features, points of access, and many other ways. Each
area presents a different problem; a design for one area
cannot be superimposed on another.

ECOMMENDATIONS for action are not for a series of crash
R programs. Large-scale acquisitions and deve10pment
programs are needed; so is money—lots of it. The essential
ingredient, however, is imagination. The egectiveness of
land, not sheer quantity, is the key. There should be the
preservation of the natural heritage of the nation. This is
interpreted to mean not only the preservation of the state
of natural resources of outstanding scenic, scientific or his-
toric importance—hut preservation of ideas and ideals of
camping.

Water is a key factor in camping. It is essential for many
forms of recreation and it adds to the enjoyment of others.

110

There are, however, serious problems which will require
effort, time, and money to solve. The problems are in three
categories. The quality of water is as important as the
amount of surface areas, miles of banks, or location. Pol-
luted water in the ocean, a lake, a river, or a reservoir is of
little use for recreation. Pollution by human or industrial
waste is only one aspect of quality which conditions the
supply. The silt load, the bottom condition, temperature, and
aquatic plans also affect the usability of water for camping.

One of the direct problems within the water resources
area is the problem of boating. Many camps offer this
program but the citizenry is catching on fast. California
now has more boats registered than cars. With this growth
of boating, camping people and all pe0ple in general are
faced with the increased problems of safety, education,
identification, law enforcement, and construction of access
roads, parking areas, and ramps.

CCORDING to the US. Coast Guard, boating is a billion-
dollar business. It is big, getting bigger, and there is
only one thing wrong with it: It attracts idiots! In general,
the USCG has charge of licensing of boats around the
coastal waters of America. However, it has neither the men
nor the boats to do the ob. To drive a car you need a license.
To get this license you must pass a test. To run a boat you
need nothing except the boat. There are no tests for the pilot
unless he is a professional and he has paying customers.
The coastal waters are full of drunks piloting boats at top
speed. They are also full of boys with snappy little runabouts
and high-speed outboard engines.

A problem for camps? I dare say—~water is a fundamental
need of camps. The growth of boating and its surmounting
problems, the upsweep of pollution, and the vast needs for
water resources should give impetus to the focus on this need
by the modern camp today if it is to do justice to the clien-
tele it is designed for and obligated to serve.

We know that the rivers are polluted, what are we to do?
We know that land today will never have the same value
tomorrow and we know too that the “J ohnny-come-latelies”
will swing into providing leisure-time pursuits for financial
exploitation. As this leisure increases, the bite on the public,
tax, and charitable and philanthropic dollar will increase.
The almighty dollar must be stretched to greater lengths and
give service to more people—toddlers to teenagers, young
adults to golden-agers—to be effective.

Today’s mushrooming population has one acre of land
which it calls its own per person. Scientists predict that by
the year 2000 there will be one square foot of land for each
human being throughout the world. By land, I mean all land
from grassy meadows and plowed fields to lofty mountains
and dry deserts. This, of course, is an impossible situation
and some expert planning must be done to prevent it. Our
population is growing at a fantastic rate; this makes recrc-l
ation more and more important. It makes camping Space

a direly needed commodity. At the same time, camping,
space will dwindle away; that is, it will dwindle away unless‘

we do something about it and do it soon. What can we do?

RECREATIO;

COUNSELOR,
YOURS IS A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT

A unique opportunity

and a grave reSponsibility

S. Theodore Wool

OUNSELOR, you are by far the
l C important single element in the
camping situation. Better camp-
ing depends essentially on better coun-
seling, and better counseling on a fuller
realization of what training and per-
sonal characteristics are required of
counselors in order to understand chil-
dren’s needs and desires.
The counselor has a unique oppor-
tunity and a grave responsibility. For
the camping season, he is entrusted with
the care and development of the camp-
ers under his leadership. The counselor
will act in the capacity of parent,
teacher, guide, friend, companion, and
comrade. In addition, he faces the chal-
lenge of living harmoniously with a
group of counselors and working to-
gether with the camp administrators,
other counselors, and campers in de-
veloping an efiective education and rec-
reation program.
Today, camping philosophy centers
about the camper, and camping is rec-
ognized as an integral part of child
idevelopment and growth. The camp

community is democratic in form and

controls are natural. The program is
lcentered about the campers’ interests.
The function of the counselor is to
bring about situations that contribute
to camper growth, and foster attitudes
of goodness, truth, beauty, fair play and
helpfulness. They act as friend and
comrade, they stimulate, motivate and
guide the campers into experiences that
develop personality and socially wholes
some attitudes.

   
 
 
   
   
   
   

 

MR. WOAL is a guidance counselor for
the Philadelphia Board of Education
and program director of Red Arrow
Camp, a bilingual, nonsectarian, inter-

cultural camp in Bayamon, Puerto
Rico.

 

Characteristics of the Counselor.

The prospective counselor should pos-
sess or have the ability to develop:

1. Love for and the ability to mingle
with children.

2. A sympathetic understanding of
children’s needs.

3. Ability to stimulate and motivate
enthusiastic camper participation.

4. Capacity to accept responsibility
and hard Work, “to chip in and help.”

5. Love for the out-of-doors.

6. Skill in activity areas.

All camping facilities—swimming
pools, arts and crafts, recreation hall,
will never bring one an inch closer
to attaining camping objectives if there
is lacking a sympathetic, mature social-
minded leadership on the part of the
counselor, a leadership that is continu-
ally attractive to the campers and one
that is willing and able to place the
welfare of the camper above all per-
sonal feelings.

Thus, among the more important
is the
ability to accept responsibility, mature
judgment, stability.
These qualities manifest themselves in
the naturalness with which the coun-
selor"mingles with the campers, in the
initiative, resourcefulness, and crea-
tiveness displayed by the counselor and
in the exemplary behaviour and loyalty
to camp ways exhibited by the coun-
selor. Above all, the counselor must
develop a maturity of personality that
will permit the camper to grow in his
own way. "

characteristics of counselors

and emotional

 

COUNSELORS should always be on the
lookout for clues to help them dis-

cover what campers want to do. A sig-
nificant part of the job is to ascertain
interests and, with these as a base,
guide and integrate camper activity into
the general camp program—or modify
the program to include newly discov-
ered interests. It is through this cycle
of discovery, integration, and modifi-
cation that the camping program is
evolved, expanded and enriched. This
is the dynamics of programing.

Each camper presents a double chal-
lenge to directors and counselors; hrst,
to discover interests; second, to fill
needs, including both motivation of the
camper to action and modification of

the program, as necessary. Too often,
however, we attempt to fit the camper
into an existing program rather than
build experience around the needs of

the campers.

The camping program should not
content itself with including only the
things campers know they want to do.
It should also direct them as far as pos-
sible to other goals, activities, skills,
and habits which, because of their age
and inexperience, they do not realize
they shoUld develop, but which the cul-
ture of the country and world have
proved to be desirable attributes of
personality. These things include clean-
liness of body and mind, cooperative
democratic living, the giv‘e-and-take of
everyday life, attitudes of tolerance,
goodness, truth, and beauty. #

EXPERIMENTS

IN
NATURE

EDUCATION

Recreation agencies and schools
across the country ofer a variety of
nature activities which may or may not
involve actual camping. Sometimes they
include taking the nature program into
the classroom, sometimes moving a
class out onto a nature trail or safari
or even excusing a class from its regu-
lar school routine for a weeklong lesson
of living in the outdoors. Some of these

activities follow.

Natural Heritage

HOUSANDS of persons in south-
T eastern Michigan are better ac-
quainted with their natural
heritage because of the nature program
sponsored by the Huron-Clinton Metro-
politan Authority, a five-county regional
park agency serving the counties of
Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, Wash-
tenaw, and Wayne. Over four million
inhabitants reside in the Detroit metro-
politan area which has become increas-
ingly urbanized since this park agency
was established in 1940.

Few city youngsters today have an
opportunity to study their natural en-
vironment, and the public’s thirst for
knowledge of plant and animal life
grows each year. Over 192,000 persons
participated in the program in 1963,
compared to somewhat over a thousand
when the program started in 1952. This
interest is reflected in the number of
tourists, individuals, family groups and
school-age youngsters who hear nature
lectures, listen to orientation talks, take
field trips conducted by a park natural-
ist, or enjoy self-guided hikes along the
nature trails.

The nature program was pioneered in

1952 by William F. Hopkins, chief na-

112

turalist for the authority, when he took
a group of city youngsters for a nature-
study walk along a wooded, winding
trail. Over a thousand boys and girls
hiked along the trails that first summer,
and interest was so keen that teachers
and youngsters requested conducted
field trips in the fall and winter months.

While nature trails are growing in
use at all Huron-Clinton parks, the most
popular ones are located at Kensington
Metropolitan Park, a 4,300-acre recre-
ation site along the “1-96 Freeway”
about thirty-five miles northwest of
Detroit. Many visitors get their first
glimpse of the nature area as they drive
along the park road and look across
Kingfisher Lagoon to the nature center
building. This view is always enhanced
if Canada geese are present. These birds
stay at the wildlife sanctuary until the
water freezes over and then move to
open water elsewhere in the park, where
they are fed by park personnel until
winter ends.

Four nature trails have their starting
point near the nature center. They are
named Tamarack, Deer Run, ASpen,
and Wlildwing and vary in length from
a half mile to two-and-a-half miles. A
favorite year-round recreation activity
of many individuals and families is a
leisurely walk along one of these “self-
guided” trails. Naturalists have used
labels, some with sketches, to call atten-
tion to the many interesting features
and wildlife in the area. For example.
not long ago, a 250-year-old tree toppled
over near the Tamarack Trail. Now a
drawing and printed paragraph explain
the effect of this event on the forest.
At another location, a “peepscope” in.
vites the visitor to look through a sight-
ing device to observe holes in a dead

tree used by birds and squirrels. Hence,
labels not only identify, they interpret.

There is always something of interest
along the trails. In winter, birdlife can
be viewed at a feeding station, and
youngsters love to search out animal
tracks and seek to identify animal
homes. Deer and foxes, though not fre-
quently observed, reveal their presence
by characteristic footprints in the snow.
Wildflowers are colorful in spring.
summer. and fall. Flowering dogwood
is an attraction in May. Everyone can.
study the shrubs and trees along the
trails or learn something new by taking
a nature hike.

BEYOND the nature center is the seven-

acre wildlife sanctuary, where
native animals and birds abound. Wild-
wing Lake is another stopping place for
a thousand Canada geese and the hun-
dreds of ducks that migrate during
spring and fall. Deer, colorful chip-
munks, chattering red squirrels, opos-
sums, raccoons, and the muskrat are a
few of the animals that inhabit the area.
Recently an albino red squirrel has been
an real attraction near the bird-feeding
station.

All trails return to the nature center.
This heated building has a lobby with
a brick fireplace. an exhibit room,
classroom. office, storage space, work-
room, and restrooms. The floor-to-ceil-
ing glass panels in the exhibit room
give the indoor rooms an outdoor at-
mosphere. A series of dioramas picture
the gradual change in the countryside,
covering the period when the glaciers
left ten thousand years ago. Seasonal
exhibits interpret many of the constant- i
ly changing phenomona of the park and l
of southeastern Michigan. Exhibits have
included such topics as winter animal
tracks, migrating waterfowl. winter
bird residents and their sources of food,
rock-polishing techniques, the history
of the Christmas
animals, mushrooms, tools of the Amer-

tree, insect-eating

tasks.

THESE EXHIBITS have proven educa-

tional to over 270,000 persons who
have visited the nature center since it
was dedicated in May 1957. Annual
attendance now is about eighty-five
thousand persons. Naturalists are on
duty at the center to answer questions
about the exhibits, life along the trails,
or some other aspect of natural science.
Some naturalists taught school prior to
joining the naturalist staff.

When snow blankets southeastern
Michigan, Huron-Clinton naturalists
travel to schools in the five counties and
give lectures to youngsters of all ages.
Film and color slides help tell the story
of the out-of—doors in this phase of the
program, available from November 1
through March 31 annually. Over sixty-
six thousand youngsters participated in
this free service during 1962-63.

In 1964, the greatest growth in the
program is expected at Stony Creek
Metropolitan Park, a 3,500-acre recre-
ation site near Romeo. This park and
its nature center, opening some time in
1964, will meet the needs of park visi-
tors and school groups from north and
northeast Detroit as well as residents
of many communities in MaCOmb and
Oakland Counties. Robert Kelly, park
naturalist, is already working on ex-
hibits and trails at the site, where a
former country estate of colonial design
had been converted into a nature center.

The nature program at other author-
ity parks is more seasonal. Metropolitan
Beach, a favorite tourist attraction
along Lake St. Clair, southeast of Mt.
Clemens and twenty-two miles from
downtown Detroit, has a marshy nature
trail that‘is primarily useful during the
spring, summer, and fall. Hudson Mills
and Dexter-Huron Metropolitan Parks,
located along the Huron River north-
west of Ann Arbor, offer summer lec-
tures and guided nature hikes sUpplied
by an authority naturalist. One of the
longest nature trails is Acorn Trail at

Hudson Mills which winds through a
113

heavily wooded area and touches por-
tions of the Huron River. This site has
an excellent potential because of the
naturally wooded countryside and its
abundant wildlife. — JOHN STERLING,
Public Relations Director, H uron-Clin-
ton Metropolitan Authority, Detroit.

ANY CAMPERS tend to shy away
M from nature study in pursuit of
what they deem more “adven-
turous” activities. Yet summer campers
can have an exciting adventure in plan-
ing and building a nature trail. This
will teach the campers a great deal about
their environment. The “key-sheet”
nature trail described below was con-
structed at the Cortland College Camp
at Raquette Lake, New York. Nature
trails can take many forms. This trail
has numbered posts corresponding to a
“key-sheet.”

The Key-Sheet Trail

Once your “trail builders” have been
designated and a staff member (who has
some elementary knowledge of the local
plants and animals) assigned, you are
ready to go to work. First, the group
must be organized into various teams
each responsible for one of the follow-
ing duties: (1) trail-clearing, (2) post
and plaque making, (3) researching,
(4) preparing the entrance sign and
box to hold the key sheets. The entire
group should participate in choosing
the best trail route and features which
will be used. Here are some important
points to keep in mind when choosing
the route:

Accessibility. Start and end the trail
near a common gathering place, such
as the dining or recreation halls. If this
is not possible, place a sign in the
vicinity of the camp bulletin board
giving directions to the nature trail.

Route. Although an existing footpath
can be used, it is more challenging to
create a new trail. If possible, a variety
of habitats should be covered, such as
a woodland, meadow, swamp, bog, et
cetera. Instead of a straight-line route,
include some gradual turns, or even a
figure eight for added diversity. As to
the length of the trail, try to stay undcr
a half mile; even a trail three hundred
or four hundred yards long can convey

114

considerable information. To help you
later, lay out your tentative trail route
with string or colored ribbon.

Features. Although you may decide to
limit your trail to a single topic, such
as wildflowers, it may be general and
include trees, shrubs, fungi, lichens,
mosses, wildlife signs, ecological rela-
tionships, geological formations, et
cetera. To facilitate placing numbered
posters later, mark all the features you

have decided upon with a colored

ribbon.

OW you are ready to get your “trail
blazers to work at clearing the
footpath to a width of not more than
two or three feet. Supervise your trail-
makers to avoid accidents, unnecessary
destruction of interesting features and

protected plants. The post and plaque
makers should be busy in the craft shop
making posts from two-by-two-inch
pieces of lumber cut to four feet in
length. The plaques should measure
about four by six inches; the thickness
will depend on the material you are
using. Quarter-inch plywood or slab
cuts will serve the purpose. The num-
bers can be carved or burned into the
wood. Both plaques and posts should
be varnished or shellacked or simply
creosoted for protection from the ele-
ments. Treat the post ends with a wood
prescrvative. In this way they can be
left in place the year round if desired.
Remember, one or more of the num-
bercd posts should always be in view
along the trail if at all possible.
Simultaneously, the researchers
should be preparing explanations for

the key sheets. An excellent source to

begin with is E. L. Pahner’s F ieldbook
of Natural History (McGraw-Hill,
1949) which has information on many
common plants and animals found in‘
the United States. It is important to
remember that the descriptions should
do more than merely name the features.
They should tell a brief story conveying
an interesting fact, such as the medicinal
use of a plant, its economic use, which
animals eat it, et cetera. For example:

WHITE ASH. Note the opposite

branches, compound leaves and light
gray bark. The wood of the white
ash is choice material for tool han-
dles, oars, baseball bats, snowshoes,
and furniture.

THE AGE of the campers will deter-
mine just how simple or complex

the wording should be and whether or

not you want to use scientific names.

The team making the entrance sign
will need three logs. The two logs for
the uprights should measure at least
five to seven inches in diameter and be
about six feet in length. The crosspiece
should measure at least three to four
inches in diameter and be about five feet
long. From the cross-piece hang a rustic
sign, made from a slab cut approximate-
ly three feet long and twelve inches
wide. Burn or carve your message into
the wood.

A waterproof container for the key
sheets should be placed within a few
feet of the entrance sign. This container
can also be made from slab lumber and
should have inside dimensions of at
least ten-by-fifteen-by-four inches.
Mount the box on a post three or four
inches in diameter and about five feet
in length. Varnish or creosote this also.

A nature trail is never really finished. 'I
You can improve it with every camp
season by building side trails, extending
the original trail, adding new features
or even building a trailside museum.

THE NATURE TRAIL will give a boost
to the aims and goals of every good
camp: pride in accomplishments, a
sense of responsibility attained by
campers as they maintain the trail
throughout the camp scason, develop-
ment of constructive work habits, ap-
prcciation of working together as a
tcam.
The nature program will be enhanccd

RECREATION

by use of the trail with nature instruc-
tion and the existence of a self-teaching
device, especially if no nature program
existed previously. Campers will be en-
couraged to use natural materials for
craft projects, making collections, main-
taining live animals. The nature trail
“adventure” will help to disseminate an
appreciation of the natural world
around us and our dependence upon it.

Adventures in Nature
PROGRAM of study and fun in the
exploration of nature was in-

A augurated by the Lawrence,
Kansas, Recreation Commission as a
part of its 1963 summer program. Called
“Adventures in Nature,” the program
was designed to give young participants
about to enter the sixth and seventh
grades an experience in the world of
nature around us. A paid supervisor
and two volunteers helped organize and
direct the program. Numerous volun-
teers were also used as resource people.

The program was divided into two-
week periods with each participant
taking part in eleven activities. Sessions
were scheduled either in the early morn-
ing or evening depending upon the
nature of the activity and the availabili-
ty of resource personnel. The faculty of
the University of Kansas in Lawrence
proved to be of great value in the proj-
ect. A number of highly qualified per-
sons volunteered to assist with various
phases of nature study.

The first session was held in the
evening around a campfire. Nature as
it is found in the area was discussed and
plans for the two weeks were formu-
lated. The stars and constellations were
studied.

Subsequent sessions included the
tracking of animals and their habitat,
bird study, an insect hike, a rock bike,
a casting demonstration, a fishing ex-
pedition, and the study of marine life.
These were conducted in the mornings.
Evening sessions proved to be of equal
interest, with a visit to the Kansas Uni-
versity observatory, weather bureau,
and the University museum; an insight
into Indian lore and dances given by

Indians from the Haskell Indian Insti-
tute in Lawrence; folk music by a uni-

MARCH, 1964

versity professor; and craft projects.
Other activities included were wood-
carving, a discussion of guns and safety,
canoeing, and a demonstration of the
preparation of animals, trees, et cetera
for a museum. Each two-week session
culminated in an overnight camping
trip on a nearby stream where a closing
ceremony was coilducted.

The morning and evening hours
allowed children to participate in the
activity, attend daycamp, playgrounds,
or take part in sports without conflict.
Response to the program was enthusi-
astic and gratifying. Parents were in-
vited to attend any of the sessions and
were very cooperative in pooling trans-
portation ; to! various meeting areas.
Each participant paid a one-dollar fee
used for food to be cooked over an open
lire, ‘ :

Prizes, such as chameleons or turtles,
were givenjt‘o boys and girls for stunts
or tall nature tales around the campfire.
One of the meetings was further en—
hancednby a watermelon feed. Each
two-Week period was limited to twenty
participants. By limiting the classes to
pupils entering the sixth and seventh
grades,'rwie were able to handle the de-
mand: This age group, ten to twelve,
is especially receptive to this type of
program. '— WAYNE BLY, Superinten-
dent, Lawrence Recreation Commission,

SWISS PINES, a garden and wildlife

sanctuary in Chester; County,
Pennsylvania, near Phoenixville,
is being created under a master plan

which calls for a ten- or fifteen-acre,

section of the three hundred acres being
developed every five years. Established
in 1958 on the grounds of a private
estate, the sanctuary is administered by
the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia with the support of a pri-
vate foundation and is being developed
by a board of advisors. It is dedicated
to the promotion of educational, scienti-
fic, research, charitable, and literary
activities in the fields of horticulture,
ornithology, conservation, and wildlife.
lts founders claim that by the year 2000
the sanctuary will be “the only green
spot in a sea of asphalt, concrete, and
brick, an oasis in the midst of sub-
urbia,” slurbia. and sprawlurbia.

Already busloads of school children
and other visitors rove through the

newly completed Japanese, Polynesian,
herb, rose, fern, and iris gardens as
well as a beautiful nature trail. The
estate’s 1821 Colonial mansion shaded
by hundred-year-old trees welcomes the
visitors. Also on the estate is a hundred-
year-old stone replica of a circular
Roman teahouse topped by a twenty-
five-ton copper dome. A future conser-
vation project will involve planting
thirty unusual trees that will thrive in
the area. Among these rare trees are
several Himalayan spruce, a freak cross
between a hickory and a pecan, willow
oaks, franklinias, and a number of
weeping dogwoods.

Classroom in the Forest

LASS was dismissed and eighty:-
four sixth-graders in Ridgewood,

New Jersey, took off for the open

road last fall and a weeklong lesson
living in the outdoors. With three teachi-
ers, they settled down at a ISO-acre
woodland camp in nearby Ringwood
and for fifteen hours a day soaked up
nature lore firsthand. They delved into
geology, botany, surveying, foresiry,
and weather prediction. They explored
the problem of water conservation and
watershed areas and toured nearby
Wanaque Reservoir. They went on be;-
fore-breakfast bird walks at 6:45AM.
The children kept a journal of their
outdoor experiences as resource ma-
terial for poems, essays, and stories
after they returned to their classrooms.

DAY CAMPING . . .

An Answer to Summer Needs

Enthusiastic youngsters “sell” camping

as activity for entire family

Robert P. ledger

HE TOWN of Bristol, nestled quiet-
I ly in the Cardigan-Newfound

region of New Hampshire, now
owns 135 acres of crest-covered wood-
land overlooking the town, the gift of
a local citizen. It was given to the com-
munity with the stipulation the land he
used for outdoor recreation, practical
conservation, and nature study, and that
it be administered by the Slim Baker
Fund for Outdoor Living, Inc. Slim
Baker was a popular state conservation
ofhcer.

These wooded acres offered an ideal
location for the day-camp program
contemplated by the Bristol Recreation
Department. In addition to relieving
the immediate problem of facilities for
this program, it also represented a step
toward realizing another aim, that of
rousing local interest in family camping.
One thing leading to another, it seemed
logical to assume that enthusiasm for
camping could, in time, “carry over”
from enthusiastic youngsters to the
whole family. As a matter of fact, that
is the way it has worked out.

In 1958, the initial step of founding
the Slim Baker Day Camp was taken
under the direction of the recreation
department, which felt the day-camping
program should be a realistic one. It
therefore started by clearly defining
“camping,” then determined how to
best adapt it to the local situation. One
thing could be certain: day camping
was not to be a displaced playground
program moved to a wooded lot with
the addition of cookies and milk and

spiced with occasional trips to “amuse-
ment parks” and “nature land.” To get
the maximum benefit from day camp,
the leaders had to reach down to the
grass roots and start with the basic
fundamentals of living in the great
outdoors.

THREE TIMES WEEKLY during the
months of July and August, sixty
boys and girls, ranging in age from
nine to fifteen, now actively participate
in a “real” camping experience. The
younger children certainly were novices
at the outset. The older youngsters were
effectively used as junior leaders. As
the campers become more proficient,
they gradually move up the ladder in
a self-perpetuating leadership program.
At 8:45AM on the designated days,
these sixty youngsters and their leaders
meet at a central location in the village
and hike half a mile up the hill to the
recreation area. For many of the young-
sters, this is their first attempt at hiking
and proves quite strenuous. Without a
doubt, this trek alone serves their phy-
sical-fitness needs for the day, and it is
just the beginning of a rigorous but
exciting and rewarding experience.
After traditional flag-raising cere-
monies, the campers divide into small
groups under the supervision of the
adult and junior leaders to work on a
prescribed program of requirements,
which will qualify them as accomplished
outdoorsmen. At noon the bell rings to
signal rest and lunch. At 12:45, they
“fall in” for the descent back to the
village. There the campers join with
other local youngsters who have at-
tended the playground activities, and

all are transported three miles to New-
found Lake for a program of instruc-
tional and informal swimming.

It should not be interpreted that the
camp is all work and no play, because
this is far from true. An extensive
period of games, songs, skits, story-
telling, and special events are woven
into the busy day as a necessary com-
ponent.

ONCE the youngsters are divided into

smaller homogeneous groups, they
begin working on their requirements.
Each division selects its own name-—
usually of Indian origin—and enters
into competition with other groups of
campers. Points are awarded to the
competitors for successfully performing
the following: entertaining the entire
camp on special occasions, maintaining
neat campsites, excelling in archery,
swimming, physical fitness, and so on.
At the end of the season, the winning
team is rewarded and an outstanding
junior leader is selected.

The specific proficiency classifica-
tions for which they strive are Pioneer,
F routiersman, Sourdough, and Voy-
ageur. In most instances, it takes a full
summer to complete one of the catego-
ries. A record of each camper is filed
to chart individual progress.

It would be too lengthy to list all of
the phases of camping offered; a few
include: learning and practicing the
Conservation Pledge; knowledge and
ability to safely handle jack knives and
hatchets; ability to distinguish native
trees and flowers; learning to tie knots
and lashing; marking trails; knowing
how to react if lost in the woods; build-

RECREATION

ing and cooking over open fires.

It is diflicult for a few leaders to
specialize in all phases of camping, so
the director quite frequently uses spe-
cialists throughout the state to assist
with instruction. Excellent cooperation
in the past has been given by county
forestors, United States soil conserva-
tion specialists, fish and game depart-
ment wardens, outdoor educators,
mountain climbers, et cetera. Utilizing
the experts is beneficial to the young
campers and relieves leaders from
spreading themselves too thin and
thereby being ineffective.

The most difficult and most important
phase of instruction is to instill self-

discipline in each boy and girl. This is
a continuous process throughout the
entire summer and is actually the largest

successful

factor in determining a

camping experience.

li‘ROM THE VERY FIRST day of camp,
the individual camper aims toward

qualifying for the season-ending cam-
poree held in one of the state or na-
tional parks in New England. To quali-
fy, one must be able to pitch a tent,
build a dry and wet fire, cook his own

meals, prove he can be self-sufficient
without help from the leader and pass
the basic Pioneer classification.

Prior to the camporee, several “prac-
tice sessions” are scheduled to iron out
all the flaws. One summer the “dress
rehearsal” was held in a rainstorm
which served as an extra added lesson.
It certainly produced a number of wet
socks and hard-to-recognize breakfast
plates—all part of a damp but useful
session!

At a first glance, one might suspect a
day-camping program for children
would be expensive. The first few sea-
sons, the only necessary equipment can
be supplied very inexpensively. How-
ever, bedrolls can be substituted for
sleeping bags, paper plates can replace
mess kits, and thermos bottles used for
canteens. Every street in town has a
tent or two that can be borrowed and
an initial outlay by the recreation de-
partment for several tents can be the
beginning. An enthusiastic camper will
use birthdays and Christmas to add to
his camping gear; and, before long, a
complete camp pack can be acquired
for a nominal cost.

The enthusiasm generated at camp

is carried home and start Mom and
Dad asking questions. This will be the
first stepping stone in family camping.
First, they may hike together, then plan
an overnight trip; and, finally with a
little urging, the family will be off to
one of hundreds of camping areas
throughout the country.

In an era when the family should
spend more and more time together, we
seem to be drifting along our separate
ways. Let Dad toss his golf clubs aside,
Mom skip her sewing circle, Junior pass
up a Little League game, and make time
to have fun as a family. Camping may
be the answer; and given the chance,
the children will lead the way. Remem-
ber, they will already have some of the
necessary equipment and plenty of
knowledge. Many Bristol families have
acquired the taste for camping together
as direct result of the local day camp,
and several attend the annual Family
Camporee sponsored by the New Hamp-

shire Recreation Society each Septem-
ber. ( See “Woodsmoke for Families”

RECREATION, March 1961).

This could very well be the end result
of the recreation-department sponsored
camping in all areas of the country. Let
us continue in the lead with action! #

N INDIAN TEPEE, forty-eight feet tall, at the St. Louis
A YMCA Camps on Sunnen Lake, near Potosi, Mis-
souri, serves as a program building and a museum to
house the historical documents of the founding of the Y-
Indian Guide father-and-son program in St. Louis in 1926.
Located on high ground in the bend of the shoreline of the
350-acre lake, the tepee gives a commanding view in all
directions.
Details of the structure, designed by John A. Thompson,
AIA, and built by the Strayer Construction Company of

Potosi, are as follows:

MARCH, 1964

o The frame construction at the base is thirty-six feet on a
concrete slab.

o The sixteen 52-foot triple-thickness built-up rafters extend
through the walls and form sixteen triangular panels for the
roof. Rafters are secured at the top by an anchor ring, and
there is a tension ring with tie rods about midway- up the
rafters. I

0 Roof sheathing is five-eighth-inch plywood over purlins
and rafters, covered with felt paper and three-tab compo-
sition shingles which had to be cut to single tabs for most of
the roof designs. In addition to the thunderbirds on the
front and back, there are winged birds, a hypothetical ani-
mal, lightning, and a human figure, all within the confines of
a mosaic type of design. The only liberty taken with the
medium of the composition shingles was in two instances to
split a tab to continue a design over the rafter ridges.

o The raised center fireplace is five feet in diameter, covered
by a fourteen-gauge metal hood connected to a twelve-inch
flue running up to a roof cap assembly of simulated rafter
extensions, vent and stack, likewise of fourteen-gauge iron.
The hood is adjustable. '

0 Windows and glassed shallow display cases alternate
around the walls of the lower portion. Murals are planned
for inside the roof panels up to the rafter tie rods—LEROY

HE RESERVOIR was full of water,
T the teenage campers were full of

questions—technical, economic,
sociological—and much water was to
flow over the dam before the youngsters
had all the answers they were after.
The questions had come to their mind
as they had paddled up and down the
Delaware River and observed the busy
activity along its banks. The young
canoeists took off on an eye-opening
quest.

Each summer the most absorbing
part of the program for thirteen- and
fourteen-year-olds at the Ethical Cul-
ture School Camp near Cooperstown,
New York, has been the study of the
communities and world around them.
Through interviews and visits with local
residents, as well as through back-
ground research—for example in the
Farmers Museum in Cooperstown
these boys and girls have discovered
much that illuminates their study.

Started originally with the active co-
operation of the New York State His-
torical Society and the Oneonta State

f‘

Robert E. Roth

 

Teachers College, the program in recent
years has centered around the campers’
growing interest in conservation. The
camp is sponsored by the Ethical Cul-
ture Schools of New York City. The
educational philosophy of these schools,
in which conservation is an important
concern, colors the program of the
camp, although about two-thirds of the
campers come from other schools.

In 1962 the older campers undertook
to study problems connected with the
construction of a new reservoir, part
of New York City’s water supply. Their
special interest in this system, particu-
larly the Delaware River Basin project,
stemmed from the fact that for several
years the camp had used the East
Branch of the Delaware for canoe trips.
During the summer of 1961, as they
paddled up and down the river, camp-
ers had been curious about the activity
they observed on its banks, especially
about heavy equipment being used to
build new roads, relocate railroads, and
dig tunnels. Most of the boys and girls
live in New York or in cities that are

located along the Delaware and are at
least partly dependent on the river for
water. They were interested to learn
that a reservoir was being built so far
north of the metropolis; they wondered
how it was planned, how it would work,
what it would do to the surrounding
country and, still more important, how
it would affect the people living there.

A preliminary survey by a camp
counsellor revealed two possible areas
for investigation: a five-year-old reser-
voir at Downsville, New York, and one
then under construction at Cannons-
ville. We decided to study both to get
a “before-and-after” picture that would
not only tell us something about prob-
lems of watershed planning, develop-
ment, and management but also give
some insight into the social and econo-
mic upheaval that may result from the
building of a reservoir.

The older campers were divided into
two teams: Team A to study the con-
struction at Cannonsville, Team B to
cover the completed Downsville project.
Within each team, four committees of

RECREATION

two or three boys and girls would ex-
plore particular interests: engineering
problems, the social effects of the proj-
ects, the economics involved, and prac-
tical arrangements for camping.

Those interested in engineering were
to collect information on construction
problems and their technical solutions;
on equipment; on watershed planning,
particularly water needs and uses; on
the suitability of land for the purpose.
Social aspect of the projects with which
the campers were concerned included
such matters as family longevity in the
areas, loss of jobs caused by the reser-
voir construction, police protection of
condemned property, problems involved
in relocating families, the feelings of
people concerning the whole process.
The economics committee undertook to
study questions of taxation, the rise in
living costs resulting from the building
of the reservoirs, land costs, wages, the
destruction and removal of buildings,
costs of relocating farms and industries.

A fourth group on each team took
responsibilty for overnight trips in its

area: selecting and maintaining camp
sites; planning menus; collecting equip-
ment, including tents and utensils;
building campfires, cooking, and other
chores.

T1113 ENGINEERING committees of both
teams inaugurated the study with
a visit to the deputy chief engineer of
the entire system to get an overview of
the Cannonsville project as well as in-
formation about plans, problems, and
procedures involved in building the
reservoirs and the results to be expected.
They found to their surprise that the
two reservoirs would increase New York
City’s water supply by about twenty
percent. They gathered statistics on the
size of the reservoirs, the volume of
water, land area covered, materials
used, and construction costs. They
learned something about how tunnels
are built, and were impressed, for ex-
ample, by the fact that one tunnel,
which carries the water forty-four miles
on its way to the city, is virtually in-
destructible because it was driven
through solid bedrock at great depth,
two thousand feet at one point. They
began to understand the pride that en-
gineers take in their work, when they
realized how exacting it is. , a

The engineer also discussed some of
the procedures involved in acquiring
land for such a purpose and explained
the laws of eminent domain. He told the
campers that all land in the watershed
system had been or was being purchased
for prices set by a three-man appraisal
board appointed by the New York State
Supreme Court. Both the living and the
dead had to move. About nine hundred
farms were being acquired to make way
for the Cannonsville Reservoir. The
owners had to find new homes; from
local cemetaries, 923 bodies were being
removed for reburial elsewhere. He
pointed out that in some cases local
people had speculated in real-estate
values, building new houses in order to
resell them to the city at a profit.

This committee arranged with the
deputy engineer for campers in the
study group to visit the dam and reser-
voir sites at both Cannonsville and
Downsville. They got permission for
Team A to camp overnight in the Can-
nonsville reservoir area, which would
soon be covered by ninety feet of water.

On this trip, the whole team was taken
on a tour of the construction work that
was proceeding on the Cannonsville
dam and reservoir. It saw gigantic
machinery hauling earth and packing
it into the new dam; it saw forests be-
ing cut to clear the reservoir bottom.
When the children asked why the timber
was being burned instead of used, the
engineer explained that it was not eco-
nomical to haul, saw, and market it.
He also told them something about how
crops previously grown on the land,
and its fertility, affect the quality of the
water in a reservoir. He explained plans
and techniques of the construction while
we watched it actually happening.

WHEN THE GROUP turned to the
campsite, half the team got to

work building a fire and preparing sup-
per while the rest went off to talk to
people in Cannonsville and to set up
interviews with other residents for the
following morning. That evening,
around the campfire, the engineering
committee, shared with other members
of the team the information they had
gleaned from their earlier visit with the
deputy chief engineer, illustrating their
talk with drawings they had made.

Next day more interviews were held.
These followed a pattern designed by
the campers themselves, who thought
up the questions they wanted to ask.
“How do you feel about moving?” was
one that brought mixed responses. Most
of the Cannonsville people, the campers
found, were satisfied with the compen-
sation they had received and did not
seem to mind going. However, in talk-
ing with people whose families had
lived in the same home for several gen-
erations, the boys and girls discovered
how strong such ties can be.

“Are you for or against the project?”
elicited answers based more often on
how “the project” would affect the in-
dividual and his family than on an
objective evaluation. Human aspects of
the enterprise were also revealed by
answers to such questions as: “Where
are most of the peope relocating? How
will the relocation affect your employ-
ment or profession? How do you think
this community will be changed?”

The economics committee found that
the low wages and land prices that had

119

prevailed in the area, and the relatively
good prices paid by the city, helped
reconcile many people to the move. The
campers were interested to learn that
only 225 men were employed on the
Cannonsville project, because so much
of the work was done by big machinery.
After a guided tour of the construction
site of the tunnel and aqueduct at Can-
nonsville, Team A returned to their
camp by way of Downsville, to get a
view of the completed phase of the
Delaware project.

EXT on the agenda was Team B’s
N overnight trip to Downsville. 0n the
West Branch of the Delaware, the camp—
ing committee discovered a beautiful
new public campsite—built, it learned
later, as a direct result of the reservoir
construction. After setting up camp, the
youngsters traveled by car to the dam,
where the dam master explained its
operation. They visited the room from
which big forty-six-inch valves, about
a hundred feet below at the foot of the
dam, are controlled, letting water out
of the reservoir to maintain a minimum
flow of water in the river. They.saw
meters that kept account of millions of
gallons of water. The dam master also
showed us over the chlorination plant,
where chlorine is inected into the water
on its way into the long tunnel through
which it flows to the city.

After supper that evening the engi-
neering committee discussed the infor-
mation they had obtained from their

initial interview with the deputy chief
engineer to help the other campers un-
derstand what they had seen that day.
Next day, the social and economics
committees interviewed business men,
town officials, ministers, priests, and
other Downsville residents. The picture
they formed differed somewhat from
that of Cannonsville, for although the
Downsville reservoir had displaced
some nine hundred people, these were
no longer around to protest, if they
had wanted to. Those who remained
seemed generally indifferent to the proj-
ect; a few resented it; while some
thought that it had benefited the com—
munity. In the five years since the res-
ervoir had been completed, new homes
had been built and the surrounding
territory had taken on some of the
character of a summer resort.

At both Cannonsville and Downsville
the teenagers found the engineers and
townspeople most cooperative and wil-
ling to talk to the boys and girls. Some
were more forthcoming than others,
but, as a rule, they seemed impressed
with the serious purpose and intelligent
interest shown by these youngsters.

BACK at the main camp both teams
organized the material collected
and presented it for each other. The
discussion that followed was so inter-
esting that they decided to share the
whole story with the other campers.

A community study of this kind has
much to recommend it as a summer-
camp program for thirteen- and four-
teen-year-olds, who may be a bit blasé
about conventional programs, especial-
ly if they have been at camp for several
summers. This kind of study satisfied

their need for a mature and challeng-
ing activity. The subject and approach

should, of course, be carefully chosen
to fit the interests and educational back-

ground of the children who are to un-
dertake it. A project that grows spon-
taneously, as this one did, out of the
youngsters’ own curiosity, is more like-
ly to enlist their active interest than one
imposed on them by adults. If they are
given as much responsibility as possible
in planning the project and carrying it
out. they will approach it with greater
enthusiasm. It is essential, of course,
that adults should pave the way for

their efforts in order to prevent stum-
bling blocks that might dismay them.

CONSERVATION is a field that offers
many focal interests for studies
that can prove fascinating to young
people of this age and, on a more
sophisticated level, to older campers as
well. Most youngsters who come to
camp already love the out-of-doors; the
conservation approach lends added
dignity and purpose to nature study.
It also involves the adolescent’s emo-
tions and his growing social awareness,
drawing these into constructive chan-
nels. Communities within range of any
camp usually offer special opportunities
for developing study programs on a
variety of subjects: an industry that
employs migrant workers; a village,
town, or rural area that is undergoing
rapid social and economic change; the
historical background and associations
of the neighborhood.

Whatever the subject, boys and girls
learn much more from such a study
than just the facts they unearth. They
learn to do first-hand research, to inter-
pret statistics, to organize and carry out
plans, to assume responsibility, and
they have fun while they are learning.
They gain insight into ways of life
strange to them. They get to know peo-
ple whose background and experience
is very different from theirs, accepting
them and being accepted with mutual
respect.

They make important discoveries
about the interdependence of living
creatures and the interrelationship of
man to his environment. As they begin
to apply these discoveries, on their own
terms, to their own environments, they
are taking the first step towards trying
to make their world a better place.

For such a study, a camp is an ideal
setting because the out-of-doors pro-
vides a daily demonstration of nature’s
lessons. Working in small groups, and
in an informal atmosphere, children can
exercise initiative to the full. With over-
night camping as part of the projcct,
it becomes a memorable experience
that contributes in essential ways to a
child’s expanding sense of values. #1:

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

 

Dig In

THE SCIENCE training program in as-
tronomy and anthropology to be of-
fered this summer at the Brooklyn, New
York, Children’s Museum, under two
grants from the National Science Foun-
dation, will give outstanding high-
school students an opportunity to go on
an archaeological “dig” or to use a
radio telescope to study the universe.
Grants totaling $16,090 were made to
the museum as part of a nationwide
program sponsored by NSF to provide
gifted high-school students with a chal-
lenging opportunity for intensive work
and study in the sciences not available
to them either in high-school or first-
year college science courses.

Archaeological excavation at a pre-
historic site on Staten Island will con-
stitute a major part of the eight-week
course in “Cultural Anthropology.”
Students will spend a total of twenty-
four days on archaeological fieldwork,
learning proper digging techniques and
methods of recording and analyzing the
data obtained after careful excavation
of a given site. Excavation will take
place all day on Saturdays and Sundays
during the first six weeks of the course
and Mondays through Saturdays dur-
ing the last two weeks.

Additional field projects in anthro-
pology to be carried out by the high-
school students will include observation
and study of a community subculture in
Brooklyn, study of fossil forms and
their development at the American Mu-
seum of Natural History, and observa-
tion of primate behavior patterns at the
Bronx Zoo. At the museum, the students
will attend lectures in anthropology and
work with excavated artifacts in the
archaeology laboratory.

The program in astronomy at the mu-
seum will combine lectures and seminar
discussions in space-age astronomy with
a rare chance for students to receive
instruction and practice in the use of
observing equipment. An eight-week
course in “Observational Astronomy”
will introduce students to observational
research methods. Working in teams of
two or three, students will do their own

MARCH, 1964

research projects in fields including
sunspot evolution and solar activity,
planetary observations, variable star ob-
servations, radio astronomy, or pho-
tography of selected star fields. To car-
ry out these projects students will use
the observing facilities of the Brooklyn
College Weinrich Observatory and the
refracting telescope and steerable Yagi-

type radio telescope at the museum.
“Topics in Contemporary Astrono-
my,” a six-week course, will also fa-
miliarize students with the newest in-
struments in astronomy and explore
current problems in astronomy and
space science. As part of their program
students will observe variable stars at
the Brooklyn College Observatory. Lec-
tures and seminars will deal with topics
including stellar and galactic structure
and evolution, cosmology, the radio
universe, space-age astronomy, and new
techniques in observational astronomy.
Astronomy students will also make two
field trips during the summer to the
Princeton and Yale University Observa-
tories where they will be given Special
tours of the observing facilities and

learn about the research projects cur-
rently in progress at these institutions.

History Personified
THE RISE of the United States as a

world power and the importance
of travel and communication in the de-
velopment of this nation are two of the
themes which are commemorated in the
latest list of forty-eight sites approved
for U.S. Registered National Historic
Landmark status. In addition to sites
connected with political and military
affairs after 1865 and traVel and com-
munication, new landmark sites were
named which illustrate architectural
and archeological areas, commerce and
industry, conseriration of natural re-
sources, and Westward expansion.

Dehumidified Skating

AIPE-NRA Joint Board Meeting

JOINT MEETING of the Executive Board of the American Institute of Park
Executives and of the Board of Trustees of the National Recreation Asso-

 

ciation was held in the Association’s New York Headquarters on January 20,
1964. Alfred B. LaGasse, AIPE executive director, presented a report covering
the federation and/or unification of organizations serving the park and recre-
ation field which he had prepared after consultation with the executive directors
of the NRA and the American Recreation Society. The presentation was well
received and a good general discussion followed.

Norman S. Johnson, AIPE president, stated that the AIPE Executive Board
had taken the following seven specific actions on the report after it had
been presented to them the previous day: (1) adopted the plan in principle,
(2) agreed to submit it to the National Recreation Association, (3) to the
American Recreation Society, (4) to the ‘National Industrial Association,
(5) authorized its executive director to work with any or all of the organizations
to accomplish the plan, (6) agreed to seek an early reply date, and (7) tenta-
tively approved submitting it to its membership for approval by September.

James H. Evans, chairman of the NRA Board of Trustees, stated that NRA
welcomed the plan, was dedicated to finding a way to bring the organizations
together, and its Subcommittee on Organizational Relationships would study
the plan immediately and report its recommendations to the Association’s
Board of Trustees for action as soon as possible.

Bird Seed

M

Angeles recently planted the city’s offi-
cial flower, the bird of paradise, at four-
teen recreation centers throughout the
city. Hundreds of bird-of—paradise
{Strelitzia Reginae) seeds were donated
to the city’s department of recreation
and parks by Mrs. Manfred Meyberg.
When the plant blooms, orange feathers
and blue needle-shaped petals rise from
a boatlike stem. A member of the de-
partment’s horticulture division staff

EMBERS of senior citizens’ and

children’s organizations in Los

was on hand at each planting ceremony.

Richard E. Bullard, supervisor of
horticulture, reports that youngsters
and senior citizens received additional
seeds in small containers for replanting
in their own gardens. Everyone par-
ticipating in the ceremonies also re-
ceived a mimeographed paper listing
the history, characteristics, and plant-
ing tips for the bird-of—paradise. The
plant is native of the coastal plains of
South Africa and blooms from October
through April.

The Whisky-Brown Air

ATTACKING air pollution by partial
controls is a losing battle and many
California cities face the prospect of
double eye-smarting, whisky-brown air
by the 1980’s, Stanford University smog
expert warned recently at a conference
on “Man in California, 1980’s.” Even
with full controls that now seem neither
technically nor economically feasible.
air pollution would still be a serious
problem in California of the 1980’s be-
cause of the inexorable effects of rising
population, declares Dr. Philip A.
Leighton, Stanford'emeritus professor
of chemistry and board chairman of
Metronics Associates in Palo Alto.

“In my opinion the only approach,
short of population control, is to attack.
not the products of combustion, but
combustion itself,” he said. “We must
reduce, by every possible means, the
burning of fuels in favor of nonpollut-
ing sources of heat and power. “Such a
change will occur eventually in any case
as fossil fuels are exhausted. But by
present indications this will not be for
another century or more. and in Cali-
fornia we cannot afford to wait that
long.

the questions and problems attached
thereto—would include building only

FOR FREE CHECKING SERVICE
with all the benefits of automatic checking

“Why do you make us buy a high-priced lock that does everything
but keep books when all we want is the economy and convenience
benefit of automatic checking without charging our customers for it?”

That is an old question which has been put to us many times.
The second new Sentinel—the Frechek* coin-operated lock—is the
answer, simple, economical and authoritative.

Like the new Sentinel Camductor lock, this new F rechek lock is
a high-security, door-mounted, coin-operated lock. It offers all the
time-saving, payroll saving, and convenience features for fully auto-
matic checking—except it’s for free service. An operative quarter
is required, but only temporarily to act as a key deposit. It is auto-
matically returned to the user when the key is returned and the door
is unlocked.

The key is captive in the unlocked position—cannot be removed
or locked without the quarter. Compact and simple, it has the big
advantage that you can easily install it on any lockers you already
have without making changes or boring holes—or you can buy it
with our new design economy lockers.

either... here’s how you can upgrade yours and
TURN A LOSS OPERATION INTO

A PROFITABLE ONE. . .

Twelve years ago most bathhouses cost more than today. This is
because they had to be bigger to provide for manually-operated
checking Space. And operations were always in the red ink (as tax-
paid deficits) largely because of payroll costs of manual checking,
done for free.

Then, for the first time, automatic checking was made available
through Sentinel self-service coin-Operated lockers. They have
changed the look and lowered the cost of bathhouses everywhere.

New bathhouses are smaller, streamlined for faster service, serve
more peeple. And the payroll costs are gone—while old bathhouses
have been upgraded in looks and efficiency.

This, plus the checking fees, willingly paid through the locks for
better service and more security, has turned loss operations into
profitable ones—with substantial new income to supplement tax
revenues, one of the best ways to win taxpayer support.

The Sentinel locker standards were the highest ever offered. They
were c0pied but never equaled. Now they offer even higher stand-
ards; more dollar benefits.

The proof of all this? Just ask on your letterhead and you’ll get
it—quickly, authoritatively and profitably.

Yesterday’s J
INVITATION TO THIEVES

Yesterday's coin-operated locks and hinges
were mounted where they could be seen
on the outside of the locker, a plain and
suggestive invitation to pryout crooks. As
a result, for decades substantially every
forced entry has been made at either the
lock or the hinge, as witness the typical
examples in the inserts. ,

Today’s
MAXIMUM SECURITY

Today’s new Sentinel Camductor coin-
operated locks* and the new, longer and
stronger hinges, are protectively mounted
out of siht—sensibly like the locks and
hinges on the front door of your home.
This is the biggest safety advance in this
field for forty years. Then there's . . . but
see overside.

*Patents pending

When P&R People Speak Out, Things Change For The Better

“Would you mount the front door lock of your home in
the outside door frame where it’s a visible invitation for
every passing crook?” complained many of our Parks
and Recreation customers.

Certainly not. But the point was made: for coin-
operated locks have been mounted that senseless way
for forty years—at great cost in pried-out locks and
stolen locker contents, including one case where the loss
was reported at $100,000 in jewelry samples.

That’s why, thanks to the complaining, the new
Sentinel Camductor* lock is protectively mounted out
of sight in the locker door . . . like any lock ought to be.

“But the sound of money rattling in door-mounted
cash" boxes,” our customers warned, “is too tempting,
the doors will be pried off.”

The result is a triple-function locking cam so unique
we had to coin a name for it: the Camductor*. It re-
ceives the money required to operate the lock and then,
when turned to its locked position, acts as a conductor
to drop the money into a closed security channel to the
. double-locked cash box.

Its third function, by simple and foolproof owner
adjustment*, is to accept all coins up to a quarter and
both multiple and variable coins for nearly all charges
up to 75-cents . . . and for charge in any amount by use
of its Special token—truly an automatic fee collector
for the new era ahead.

Is such flexibility needed? Many P&R professionals
think so. Some already have plans in study for total
automation of bathhouses, golf and other activities now
requiring cashiers and checkers. Keeping pace, the

Sentinel Camductor* lock anticipates this trend and
the coming need for an automatic use and entry fee

collector in variable and unrestricted amounts.

Locks Changeable for Alternate
Periods of Free and Pay Service

Outnumbering all other demands for improvement are
those for locks which can be quickly changed to operate
only with the key during periods of free admission; but
with quick change back for operation only with a coin
(or coins) in paid-admission sessions.

The Camductor* lock meets that requirement*, thus
giving free-admission patrons the same checking con-
venience and security for possessions as is given the
paid-admission patrons.

Then there were the dual demands for a less cumber-
some way to open a locker to which the key has been
lost and a quicker way to restore that locker to service
with a keyed lock.

The new Camductor* lock is opened with a master
key—quickly. Then the keyless locking cylinder is
removed and a keyed cylinder inserted—again quickly.
For the cylinders are removed and replaced from the

*Patents pending

front of the door*, without the old bother of removing
the locking mechanism and without the required me-
chanical dexterity then to remove the cylinder and
replace it.

This is another of the it-can’t-be-done-because-it’s-
never-been-dones that now has been done.

Other Never-before-dones

The Sentinel Camductor lock puts an end to the old
and costly practice, common to all makes of do locks,
of using washers instead of money; for it will not oper-
ate with ferrous slugs.

Then there’s an end to the freewheeling racket, an-
other of the 40-year abuses which permits repetitious
free service by jamming with a cardboard or other slug.

This is impossible with the new Camductor lock.*
Short of vandalism, no one can take a key without

leaving money* (another ancient racket) . . . or lock
the lock when the door is open* . . . and it will not oper-
ate with wrong-size coins.* And here’s a Ripley: outside
the cylinder, it’s locked with only two moving parts.*

And, finally, elimination of the old bugaboo of door
handles that are not only pry-out invites but deposit
catchers for dirt and chemicals that destroy finish and
even metal. How? Simple: A gentle pull on the cap-
tive key opens any unlocked door! The objectionably
“busy fronts” are gone, too.

No wonder coin-operated lockers will never be or
look the same. It’s a stimulating example of what can
happen when P&R professionals speak out——and when
a manufacturer has the courage to back their judgments
with money, the engineering skill to do it sensibly, and
the manufacturing craftsmanship to do it profitably—
for both parties.

Br FOR THE ILL €93 HANDICAPPED

 

+ All roads pointed to new hope for
progress in prevention, treatment, and
rehabilitation of the mentally retarded
as the National Association for Re-
tarded Children wound up its four-day
annual convention in Washington’s
Mayflower Hotel. The most important
development affecting retarded children
is the move towards multi-discipline
community clinics for diagnosis and
treatment, according to two leading
pediatrician-researchers.

Dr. Richard Koch, director of the
Child Development Clinic at the Los
Angeles Children’s Hospital, revealed
that in a nine-year clinic study of 143
found to be retarded before the age of
one year, twenty-four percent turned
out to be not retarded a few years later.
Ranging from mild to moderate re-
tarded as babies, they began to show
their normal abilities and potential
sometime after becoming three years of
age. Dr. Koch attributed their miracul-
ous development to four non-miraculous
reasons:

0 Correction of the children’s physical
handicaps, including eye, heart, speech,
hearing, and skeletal defects, and con-
trol of seizures as early as possible.

0 Parental understanding and affection
combined with care at home.

0 Association with normal children in
their own family and their neighbor-
hood.

0 Participation in retarded children’s
training programs sponsored by local
parents’ groups.

+ .Educational TV is being tapped for
the first time in a massive demonstra-
tion project to increase the skills of
thousands of aurally handicapped per-
sons living in the Washington, D.C.
area. Under a grant from the Neuro-
logical and Sensory Diseases Division
of the United States Public Health
Service, WETA-TV, the local educa-
tional station, will beam lipreading in-
structions of the hard-of-hearing in
thirty half-hour lessons. The course will
be broadcast free to the 850 schools
within range of the station’s transmitter
during daylight hours, and in the eve-

stated: “It is an established fact that
hard-of-hearing students often experi-
ence learning problems and develop
emotional disturbances and may have
vocational difficulties.” There are also
three to eight percent of the adult popu-
lation within viewing range with a
hearing loss who can benefit by the
Instructions.

While it is recognized that lipreading
is not a total remedy, it is an ideal sup-
plement to a hearing aid and is a requi-
site skill for persons with twenty-five
percent hearing loss in both ears. There
are only a limited number of skilled
teachers to reach all those who can
profit by such instructions, and this
project is intended to meet the needs of
those who would not ordinarily be
reached, and to supplement the current

+ A survey on recreation programs for
children in forty pediatric hOSpitals in
the United States and Canada reviews
the programs of the forty hospitals who
replied to the questionnaire sent to 128
hospitals. The report was compiled by
David Chandler of the Child Life Pro-
gram, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Balti-
more. Robert H. Dombro is director of
the hospital’s Child Life Program.
The data reveals that most hospitals
having recreation programs use play-
rooms for the major portion of their
program. There is usually an attempt to
reach bedridden patients on the wards
with special attention. Most programs
provide a minimal selection of toys,
games, and crafts. Common hours for
playroom operation are 9:30AM to
11:30AM and 2:00PM to 4:30PM, al-
though several hospitals plan to or do
at present provide service in the eve-
ning hours and/ or weekdays. Staff
salaries and supply budgets are for the

most part paid by the hospital itself.

Salaries vary from $3,000 to $7,800
annually. About half of the fifteen hos-
pitals giving a budget figure for sup-
plies spend amounts varying between
nothing and $800 annually, with a
number of the remainder using about
$1,000, and the rest $2,000 or more.
Volunteers play a major part in many
recreation programs. _

is an activity which
lends itself to inde-

families are joining forces to form
clubs which allow for greater enjoy-
ment of camping and trailering through
group participation. The “trailers”
involved in this activity are not the
house-trailer type. but the mobile travel-
trailers easily attached to the rear of
any car. They can be moved about very

to public and private camp sites. As a
family recreation activity, trailer travel
should receive greater support from
municipal and county recreation depart-
ments in the organizing of such groups
on a local, county, or regional basis.
The Hitch-um and Pitch-um Travel-
lers, a club composed of travel-trailer
and tent-camping enthusiasts, has been
organized under the auspices of the
Linden, New Jersey, Recreation Depart-
ment. Tent campers are a small minority
in the club, although both groups are
compatible, since most trailer owners
were once tent campers. Prospective
members were approached by mail
through a list of travel-trailer owners
supplied by a local trailer dealer. Tent
campers were attracted by newspaper
publicity and mimeographed fliers.
Started over three years ago with

twenty-one families, the club now has
seventy-nine families with 158 individ-
ual adult members. Love of travel and
the outdoors is the primary interest
that bands this group together. To allow
a larger and more diversified member-
ship, the club is not limited to Linden
residents, but draws its members from
communities in north and central New
Jersey and nearby Staten Island, New
York, as well.

The club is self-supporting, depend-
ing on membership dues for its oper-
ation. It has a membership of varied
talents which provides most of the pro-
gram leadership. Among the members
are small businessmen, retirees, a po-
liceman, truck drivers, a welder, cngi-
neers, tcachers, school principals, and
other professional persons. Opportuni-

tion on travel and trailer equipment are
provided at the monthly meetings when
outdoor activities and rallies are not
feasible. Travel reports of vacation ex-
periences of members, always illus-
trated with color slides and movies,
provide very interesting meeting pro—
grams.

After a long winter, the trailerites
look forward to the spring, summer,
and fall seasons to enjoy the freedom
of the outdoors. Club rallies held at
state parks and private campsites attract
most of the member families to the six
scheduled weekend campouts. In addi-
tion to these club rallies, members often
join other groups at regional and spe-
cial rallies. Four members of the club
and their families joined the New Jersey
Historymobile Caravan in a cross-
country trek to the World’s Fair at

Seattle, Washington, in summer of 1962.

Although some of the activities at
the rallies are planned for the group,
the families have ample time for‘infor-
mal easy life and an opportunity to
visit with their neighbors. A feature of
every rally is the group “feed,” which
may be a chicken barbecue, a potluck
supper, a hamburger fry, or even a pan-

cake breakfast. Invariably, the men take ,
“over at these mass cookouts, so the

affairs are especially popular with the
wives. Special activities are planned for
children, including informal softball,
swimming, horseshoes, miniature golf,
and sometimes movies.

During the summer, members go
their separate ways on trailer vacations
with their families, ranging to all sec-
tions of the United States, Canada, and
Mexico. Recently, one adventuresome

Vacation trailering is becoming in-

of travel and because of the increasing
interest of people in seeing the country.
It is hoped that the development of

DROWN PRO OFING

Fred Lanoue

bining arm and leg motions with a precise breathing
technique, anyone, irrespective of sex, age, condition,
or strength, can stay up for hours and swim miles after a
few lessons. Twenty-eight thousand Georgia Tech students
using this technique have stayed up an hour and swum a
mile wearing clothes. When the Peace Corps came into
being, “drownproofing” was immediately selected as the
aquatic training program needed, not only because of the
specific skills that so quickly produced safety in the water
for these dedicated volunteers, but because of the peculiarly
valuable attitudes that result from this type of training.
Take any group of college freshmen, the whole class from
any college——not athletes, not physical-education majors,
just ordinary freshmen. What percent could you get to swim
fifty yards underwater? The average guess of a cross-section
of the American Association of College Swimming Coaches
is that less than five percentst their whole freshman swim-
ming classes—if all freshmen had to take swimming—could

BY EMPLOYING a deceptively simple method of com-

 

do this. Georgia Tech has been doing this for twenty-eight
years with its freshmen engineers in their one quarter of
swimming in the required physical-training program, and,
whcn test day arrives, not one percent have tried this pre-
viously. At the end of the test period, our score has ncver
dropped below fifty-thrce percent and for the past ten years,
with improved lectures, has averaged sixty-three percent.

MR. LANGLE is professor of physical education and head
swimming coach at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He
is author of Drownproofing—A New Technique in “later
Safety {Prentice-Hall). The above material was presented
at the 12th annual Meeting of the Conference Cooperation
in Aquatics.

The Peace Corps men and women—ranging in age from
eighteen to sixty-nine—averaged fifty-five percent doing this
in salt water, which is harder.

This is achieved with a forty-five minute lecture, a five-
minute demonstration, and a ten-minute lecture on hyper-
ventilation and psychological distress patterns, then one try
at the test. Then sixty-three percent at Tech and approxi-
mately the same percentage at nearby Emory University,
where the same course is taught, swim fifty yards under-
water. The few girls at Georgia Tech are not required to
take physical training. Under the direction of Coach Ed
Slnyke, Emory University girls, because of this training, are
the safest from water hazards of any college girls in the
world.

Cramps and inuries are merely annoying and not danger-
0115 to “drownproofers” because when this technique is
mastered, it is just as easy to stay up with only one arm
as with both arms and both legs. The results obtained with
this system on handicapped children are utterly fantastic.
Nearly a thOUSand four- and five-year-old children in the
Atlanta area have stayed up an hour, swum one mile, stayed
up half an hour, and then swum a mile with ankles tied to
the waist, and the same thing with wrists tied behind the
back. All are clad and have usually had fifteen hours of
instruction.

All drownproofers feel that traditional swimming is usu-
ally adequate for pool and dockside swimming. Where

real distances combine to drown people in lakes, rivers.

S EVERAL ASPECTS of physics form the basis of drownproof-
ing. The first is that ninety-nine percent of all men will
remain on the surface in fresh water without moving if they

are chock full of air. About 99.99 perccnt of all women will
do the same. Actually, in a thousand cases of both scxcs,
all ages, and all walks of life, only a half dozcn will sink
if taught to float properly. Momentum and inertia forces
plus shifting floating angles make this figure seem wrong.

Proper instruction proves it correct.

for nonswimmers, after only a few lessons

a man Hoats vertically (most men float nearer the vertical
than the horizontal), about live pounds of meat is in the
air, and, with women, about eight pounds protrudes. These
figures are general—fat volume, muscle density, air trapped
in clothes, and the wet weight of the clothes themselves are
all factors. If a man wants to keep his nose and mouth out
of water all the time and see where he is going, he must
hold up with muscular energy at least five pounds all the
time; during the exhale, a lot more; and with clothes, even
more. These weights sound too small to be important, but
over a period of time they cause most of our drownings.
Drownproofers’ answer to this particular problem is
simple—why hold any meat out of water except when it is
necessary? They believe in dropping down into the water
for a rest between breaths where there is a positive force

always pushing them up rather than dragging them down.
Simple, no? But when you try it, it’s not so simple because
skill is involved in breathing close to the water.

Fresh Water Stay Afloat Technique

1. Rest vertically (especially the head), with arms and
legs hanging. Make sure the mouth is empty by spurting
water between compressed lips with tongue—~don’t blow it.

2. Get ready by extending arms sidewise and extending
one leg in front and the other in back.

3. Press feet and hands down, at the same time exhaling
through the nose and opening the eyes, followed immedi-

ately by inhaling through the mouth.

MARCH, 1964

4. As you start sinking, give a slight downward push
with arms, legs, or both.

5. Let everything rest, dangling arms and legs during
the return to the top.

6. Rest until you feel like getting a breath—never until
you need a breath. The rest interval will vary with individu-
als but should never be less than three seconds—should
become six after a few minutes, and should average ten

after an hour; many people have averaged three breaths
a minute when thoroughly indoctrinated. Sinkers can stay

up just as easily, but most use a different technique. The
average non-swimmer easily stays up an hour clad and
without getting tired after five or six tries.

The Drownproofers’ Traveling Stroke

Using the same breathing system, and alternating it with
a propulsive movement, it is easy for anyone to swim an
indefinite distance, certainly a number of miles. Generally,
the average person can do this on the second or third lesson,
after successfully completing the one-hour stay afloat.

1. Full of air, start to sink.

2. Lay head forward, bring hands to shoulders, get ready
to kick.

3-6. First extend arms, then kick, then use slow shallow
sweep of arms to the sides and glide up to and along the

surface with head horizontal—when you feel like getting
a breath.

7. Extend hands forward, then bring both knees as far
up as possible, rounding the back.

8. With head still down, extend one foot forward without
letting the other knee go back.

9. Raise the head and breathe as usual while stroking
down.

N.B. When executing these skills under the scrutiny of
uniformed lifeguards, be prepared to either be rescued or
banned from deep water, because to the uninitiated it ap-
pears that you are on the verge of drowning. #

LIFE SAVING

Water games and stunts

student feel at home in the water

and give him confidence in deal-
ing with the expected and unexpected.
In addition to standard drills, they
provide the plus that makes the differ-
ence between a mediocre lifesaver and
one who is always in full command of
the situation.

1. QUATIC GAMES and stunts help the

Water games are fun, stimulating,
and exciting. As the student participates
in the game, he forgets his fear or ap-
prehension of unexpected physical con-
tact with a simulated victim and be-
comes accustomed to the necessity of
having to make a break and save him-
self and the victim. Games in which
water wrestling is used will stimulate
a desire to learn the skills, will condition
the participants, and will relieve bore-
dom and monotony. Soon, the proper
mental attitude will be indoctrinated in
each lifesaver so he can develop confi-
dent reactions to realistic lifesaving
situations.

Several rules must be observed when
playing all water games. First, should
any person involved have any difliculty,
two taps or two pinches is the signal to
break away and surface. Second, each
person in the class, from the smallest
to the largest, male or female, is ex-
pected to be able to water wrestle and
participate in any game with any other
person in the class. Third, if a rescuer
utilizes the proper techniques, the vic-
tim is instructed to act like a victim.
However, if the rescuer makes a mis-
take, the victim is supposed to slip into
another hold or into a different po-
sition. I

After each member of the class has
had sufficient practice in the various
lifesaving approaches, defenses, breaks,
and carries, and after each has prac-
ticed with passive, semi-violent, and
violent victims, the class is ready for
violent, exciting, stimulating water

games. Following are six water games,
drills, or stunts which have been espe-
cially successful. ~

The first is a drill called the Happy
Hour, primarily a conditioning exer-
cise. It is introduced during the first
part of the course and it is recom-
mended that the length of the drill be
extended as the class becomes condi-
tioned. Happy Hour consists of a two-
minute (to start) treading-water drill
with both hands held out of the water
at wrist level. At the beginning of the
drill, a ten-pound weight is dropped to
the bottom of the pool and, as a stu-
dent’s name is called, he must surface
dive, recover the weight, and continue
the drill with the weight in his hand.
When the next student’s name is called,
the first tosses the weight to the bottom,
and the second participant recovers the
weight while the remainder of the class
continues to tread water with leg kicks
only. This drill is an excellent condi-
tioner, and, if done regularly, the time
limit can be increased.

HEN each of the basic water skills
has been taught, the station-test-
ing technique is utilized as a review
and as a self-testing drill. A class of
twenty is divided into two groups of
ten. One group is designated as instruc-
tors and each member is given a differ-
ent lifesaving skill which he will use
as a test. This group is sent to stations,
one through ten, and each member re-
mains at his station and tests each of
the second group in turn. Each member
of the second group is sent to one of
the stations, is tested, and then proceeds
to the next station to be tested: from
one to two, two to three, ten to one, and
so forth. After each test, both the “in-
structor” and the one tested appraise
the test and, if necessary, make correc-
tions. If a problem exists, the class
instructor is called to solve it. After
each person in Group Two has been
tested, the groups are reversed and the
process repeated. Ten skills can be
quickly reviewed and tested in this
manner, and each student in the class
has an opportunity to be both pupil and
instructor in turn, making rapid prog-
ress.

MARCH, 1964

After each of the different lifesaving
releases has been taught, the Circle
Game is an excellent activity that is
competitive, tests releases, and is a good
conditioner. The class is arranged in a
circle with one member chosen by the
instructor to be “It” and placed in the
middle. On the command “Start” by
the instructor, those in the circle Splash
water on the person who is “It,” and
at the same time they look up at the
instructor. “It” closes his eyes and pre-
pares to be grasped by another member
of the class. The instructor points to one
member of the class in the circle. This
person then grasps “It” by any hold
he so desires. “It,” as the lifesaver, per-
forms the appropriate release correctly
and places the victim in a cross-chest
carry to end that bout. The two then
change positions, with the one who was
“It” joining those in the circle and the
one who grasped becoming “It”. The
instructor calls, “Start” and the game
continues. If possible, have only from
five to eight in the circle. If the class
is large, have several games going on
at once.

The Survival Game is probably one
of the most challenging techniques an
instructor can employ for conditioning,
competition, and stimulating fun. It is
a simple game, but extremely competi-
tive; consequently, the instructor should
pair the students according to size and
sex until each member of the class is
proficient in all water wrestling. Two
paired students approach each other
from opposite sides of the pool and
place hands on the other’s shoulders.
They start on the command “Go,” with
the primary objective being to conquer
or overpower the other person by life-
saving techniques and take the loser
to the edge of the pool. The person who
overpowers the other and returns with
the victim is declared the winner. By
using tournament techniques a class
champion can be determined.

RELAY RACES are another means for
practicing lifesaving skills while
competing with others. The class can
be divided into teams and many differ-
ent relay races invented by the imagina-
tive instructor. Examples would be to

r

PROGRAM

pair members of a team and have “One”
swim “Two” across the pool in a tired-
swimmer’s carry, “Two” swims “One”
back, and so on. Another would be for
the first member of each class to make
a running shallow dive, swim to the
middle of the pool, surface dive and
recover an object and bring it back.
He then tosses the object back and the
second person goes, et cetera. There are
literally hundreds of these combinations
possible to stimulate the class and pro-
vide lifesaving practice.

 

The last is a stunt which provides a
very realistic lifesaving situation and
which teaches confidence and poise to
the rescuer. It is called a Free Day.
Before a particular class starts, the in-
structor secretly indicates to one, two,
or three members of the class that they
have “free days.” At any time during
that class period, the person who has
the “free day” can grasp and apply any
hold he desires on any other member of
the class. The one who is grasped must
then release the hold and proceed to
the side of the pool. The one with the
“free day” has only one Opportunity,
but the suspense of not knowing who
will grasp, when he will grasp, or how
many individuals have “free days” will
keep the class alert, and ready for any
eventuality.

The use of realistic situations in the
games and stunts, such as those recom-
mended above will stimulate the learn-
ing experience in lifesaving until each
student reacts confidently to the unex-
pected. Classes will be fun, the students
will become well conditioned and well
adjusted to the water and to water
wrestling. After a lifesaving class has
satisfactorily participated in this type of
program, the instructor can be confi-
dent he has developed in his students
the necessary physical reactions and the
proper mental attitude so each student
can satisfactorily cope with all types of
lifesaving situations. #-

Every camp leader
must know the art
of handling problem children

DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS IN CAMP

B. Harold Chetkow

HAT LEADER, in club activities or at camp, has not
W run into such problem children as:
o The big wheel who wants to order everyone else
around . . .

o The nervous child, with headaches, stomach pains, aller-
gies . . .

o The nut to whom everything you say is ust sooo funny . . .
o The tyke who acts much too grown up . . .

o The nuisance who is full of Wisecracks, practical jokes . . .
o The spoiled child, who cries, throws things, has tantrums . . .
o The exclusive type, with her one or two friends . . .

o The child who demands all your attention, clings to your
hand...

0 The character who never seems to “hear” a word you say.

The list could go on forever, as you well know. Human
behavior is a language full of meanings for the alert leader.
“Problem” behavior needs a lot of patience and understand-
ing. All children, given half a chance, have great potential
for good. If they have problems, there must be underlying
reasons; in other words, all behavior is motivated and has
meaning. When leaders wait for a child to put his unhappy
feelings in words or pictures, they have been insensitive or
lazy. They must know how to anticipate and handle “prob-
lem” children. Leaders must realize that discipline is not a
neat set of rules with neat punishments to fit every sort of
crime.

What is discipline? The word discipline comes from the
same word as disciple or follower of the master’s teachings.
It contains the idea ofh something learned from a teacher
whose example one personally wants to copy or follow; in
fact, the best kind of discipline arises out of the respect
and understanding of one human being for another. It is

ice Counril of Metropolitan Indianapolis, presented this

a cooperative and voluntary endeavor, not something im-
posed from above. True discipleship can make for long-
range improvement in the life and creativity of the group
as well as induce behavioral change in various individual
members of a group.

Rudolph Wittenberg wrote in an issue of RECREATION
( April 1955) that the development of discipline is a pro-
cess . . . “something that takes place over a long period of
time and that goes through a number of phases. If we look
at a youngster at a given moment only and see him resisting
or being cooperative, we don’t really know whether or not
he is developing discipline, because we have to relate his
behavior to his total development. We have to understand
what is good behavior for him and in what way the group
can help to develop it furthcr.” In other words, discipline
is a process of achieving self-control because of personal
motivation to do so. It stems from a dynamic and constantly
changing social relationship between persons who subscribe
voluntarily to common goals and standards. Self-control is
not something magical, it can be taught and learned!

“Good” discipline is the leader’s ability to form warm,
mutually respectful relations with the other human beings
in his group as well as his having some convictions and
standing up for them. He has to set an example worth
emulating. Boredom and frustration make for destructive-
ness and lack of attention.

LEADER must motivate people into satisfying group
A activities. Wild activities soon give way to more satis-
fying disciplined program activities because “wildness” is
really frightening to the child himself. He wants the security
of wiscly set and kept limits. A leadcr must be cognizant
of the values which are typical and acceptable within the
child’s home environment. Destructive or constructive are
relativc terms, not absolutes. A slum child may have no
conception of postponed gratification or awaiting one’s turn,
whilc the middle-class child may be used to whecdling spe-
cial privileges from adults. This raises the rcal issue of how

RECREATION

adequately we find out about prospective campers through
pre-seasonal interviews. How consciously do we communi-
cate what we know (or what was reported in last season’s
counselor records) to this year’s leaders?

A leader must convince his campers that rules apply to
everyone impartially and consistently. It is even better when
these rules were agreed upon in advance by everyone in-
volved in a discussion of possible consequences for specific
kinds of misbehavior.

ISCIPLINE is enforced by means of the leaders’ person-
D ality, enthusiasm, skills, and sense of tact. Never
embarass or scold a child in front of his friends, but do not
overlook gross Haunting of the rules, either. Set limits that
are few in number, easily understood, and can be enforced.
Be certain of all the facts and extenuating circumstances
before making a disciplinary decision. Enforce a known
consequence. Never warn repeatedly, cajole, plead, bicker,
or keep giving another chance. The leader must never de-
scend to the camper’s level.

Put the outcome up to the behavior of the “culprit,” not
fitting it to the crime. Suffering the known consequence thus

becomes a matter up to the culprit himself. Deprive the
culprit of something important to him. Aim at something
which really counts, rather than impose a conventional
punishment. If a leader constantly resorts to deprivation
or isolation, he has not really helped the child, and wanting
to avoid peer relationships may be the exact reason for this
misbehavior in the first place. If misbehavior is an attention-
getting device, a good leader will not fall for it. Help the
child to understand why his behavior brought about an
uncomfortable situation. Help him to see how he might live
within socially acceptable bounds, or get off the limb he is
now out on, without losing too much face.

Bring really serious discipline problems to the super-
visor’s attention. Taking this matter up with parents or
organizational officials is not the counselor’s responsibility.
A child with really deep-seated problems might have to be
sent home. In fact, why was he allowed to register in the
first place?

Good discipline insures an enjoyable stay at camp. The
child at camp can be helped up one or two rungs along

the ladder of citizenship and maturity under true “disciple-

ship.” #

RESEARCH BRIEFS

 

OUTDOOR RECREATION STUDIES

Camp Study for Boston Area

A COMPREHENSIVE eighteen-month

study of Greater Boston’s camps
and camping facilities has been under-
taken by United Community Services
of Metropolitan Boston. This long-range
study will evaluate thoroughly all non-
 profit camping programs Operated by
Dr. Harlow Greater Boston agencies. Some one
hundred camps, serving twenty-five thousand children, will
be involved. The UCS Camp Study will cover every possible
aspect of camps, from topography to the number of dishes
in the kitchen. The present condition of these camps and
their future needs will be measured against projected camp-
ing needs and p0pulation trends for the next decade, accord-
ing to James H. Lowell II, chairman of the camp-study
advisory committee.

Dr. Dana E. Harlow, assistant professor in the Depart-
ment of Recreation Leadership at the University of Massa-
chusetts and a well-known authority in the recreation field,
will direct the study. Dr. Harlow was granted an eighteen-
month leave of absence by the University and has already
begun the study.

The results of the study will be published and used in
the long-range planning of United Community Services’

    

Recreation-Group Work Division and Camp Council. It is.

also expected it will be used as a guide by other large cities
throughout the United States. “This study,” Mr. Lowell says,
“will help to meet an imperative need for long-range plan-
ning in the area of nonprofit camping. Camping programs
are an essential part of the health and welfare services of
the ‘New Boston.’ UCS is now accelerating its efforts to
determine the camping needs of all of the people of the
community and to learn how resources can be best utilized
to meet these needs.”

Commenting on the need for long-range camp planning,
Dr. Harlow stated: “Today’s mushrooming population in
Massachusetts has one acre of land per person. The impor-
tance of this is that our p0pulation is growing at a fantastic
rate. This makes recreation more and more important. It
makes camping space a direly needed commodity. At the
same time camping space will dwindle away unless we do
somcthing about it and do it soon. What can we do? PLAN!

“In addition, the demand for water is rising. Only with
the most careful planning will it be possible to achieve an
adequate supply of water for recreation and future camping
needs.

“To assure present and future generations of Bostonians
outtl-mr I reation opportunities of adequate quality and
quantity ~ n 1". effective management of land and water
resources a1. 1 core careful planning is urgcntly nceded.”

Kn Humph- I.’ the problems to hc examined is the one of

138

utilization of camping facilities. “In view of the developing
shortage of recreation facilities,” Dr. Harlow asks, “does it
make sense to close a camp after only an eight-week sea-
son ?” In outlining the problem of outdoor recreation needs
in Greater Boston, Dr. Harlow makes five points:

0 The demand is great and is growing. Not only are there
more people, but they are seeking the outdoors at a growing
rate, and they are likely to do so even more in the coming
decades.

0 The kind of recreation people want most is relatively
simple—a path to walk along, an attractive road to drive
along, a shady hillside for a picnic, and a chance to see trees
and green grass. This is a heritage we must preserve for
the future.

0 The dollar that supports these nonprofit camps must
stretch. It must bend and it must turn corners, but it must
be effective.

0 People want these things where they live, and where most
pe0ple live is in our growing metropolitan areas.

0 We are not running out of land. We are falling short of
using it effectively. The physical supply of land and water
for recreation is bountiful; for reasons of ownership, man-
agement or location, access to it is not. We must effectively
manage what We have and what we can acquire.

Much Is Needed

AN INCREASE in recreation lands from 9,672 acres to near-

ly 31,600 acres is necessary to meet future outdoor
recreation needs of St. Louis city and county residents,
according to a report prepared by C. Ledie Lynch, recre-
ation planner for the National Recreation Association. The
report stated that the additional land, which should be
acquired while it is still available, would be needed to pro-
vide adequate facilities for projected 1980 populations of
1,324,500 in the county and 750,000 in the city. It said a
county bond issue could be used to provide seventy-live
percent of the funds needed for land acquisition and with
twenty-five percent used as matching funds in assisting
municipalities to obtain land. The report further said that
fcderal funds could be obtained which might pay up to
thirty percent of land costs. It was also noted that the
Missouri legislature could raise matching funds through a
bond issuc.

The plan called for development of three 250-acre sites
throughout the county, each of which would include an
eighteen-hole golf course. Othcr rccomlncndations pro-
posed development of the Missouri and Mississippi River
bluffs and shoreland, flood plains on major creeks. west
county wooded areas and land around Creve Coeur and
Spanish lakes and the Meramec River. The report was
authorized by the County Council.

RECREATION

User-Resource Relationship

WITH expanding public demand for outdoor recreation
and mounting costs of deve10ping and operating rec-
reation areas, it becomes increasingly important that such
areas be designed to serve most effectively the recreation
interests of the people. A study of Outdoor Recreation Pref-
erences by Dr. Leslie M. Reid, assistant professor of park
and recreation administration at Michigan State University
in East Lansing, records and appraises the results of nation-
wide study and affords a useful guide to all who are respon-
sible for the administration of recreation areas. The re-
corded findings are based on data obtained by a question-
naire survey of 10,982 visitor groups at twenty-four selected
areas, including national and state parks and forests, federal
reservoirs, and a metropolitan county forest area. Infor-
mation is reported in four categories: socio-economic data,
travel characteristics of visiting groups, activity participa-
tion and facilities employed, and Opinions of satisfaction
and dissatisfaction associated with the visit.

The report of the study, carried on in conjunction with
the research program of the Outdoor Recreation Resources
Review Commission, sheds much light on the users of these
areas. Among the factors covered are their ages, sex, occu-
pations, education, income, and their opinion of the areas
visited. The data on type of visit, preferred activities, and
length of stay afford useful information on user-resource
relationships. Studies such as this have obvious weaknesses,
but Dr. Reid’s report provides a valuable addition to the
literature dealing with the subect. The 300-page multilithed
report is available for $6.50.—George D. Butler.

The County Executive

' THE National Association of Counties has released results
of one of the first national profile studies yet made of
that rapidly emerging public servant, the county executive.

Counties surveyed covered all population groups from
Rockbridge County, Virginia (24,000) to Los Angeles

County, California (6,453,000). The study, based on ques-

tionnaires from fifty such officials throughout the nation,
reveals that, on the whole, the county executive is a college
graduate (three of those responding to the NACO question-
naire held Phi Beta Kappa keys); and the largest single
group, ten, majored in public administration. Engineering
and business administration graduates were next in line
among fields of study. Six county managers majored in each
of these fields.

In salary, the county manager (he is sometimes called
the county executive, county administrator, or chief execu-
tive officer) ranges from $10,000 to $35,000, and the report
notes a direct correlation between the population of the
county and the size of the salary. Because of the relative
newness of the position in most counties, the “average”
county executive has had less than ten years experience in
his job—nearly thirty of the fifty who responded were in
this bracket. The county executive’s direct staff number
from one person in seven counties, to a high of fifteen re-
ported in one of the responding counties. The largest single
group, eleven, reported a stafic of three. All but three had

MARCH, 1964

 

some kind of appointive powers. Fourteen were limited to
the appointment of their immediate staffs, but ten had power
to appoint all department heads.

As for the counties themselves, those under a county-
executive form of government were spending $1,000,000,000
annually to provide an almost infinite range of services. Of
forty-six services selected at random for purposes of the
questionnaire, thirty-eight were performed by five or more
counties of the fifty included in the survey. It is interesting
to note that among this cross-section of fifty counties, they
were spending less than one half the national average (four
cents of the budget dollar versus ten and a half cents na-
tionally) on “general government” but nearly twice as much
as other counties on “health and welfare” services.

AND

DEVELOPMENTS

ELVIRA DELANY

 

CALIFORNIA. The Old Ships are home. Berthed at a

refurnished pier which in days long gone once docked ferry-
boats every twenty minutes for the run to Sausalito, the Old
Ships form the nucleus of the San Francisco Maritime State
Historical Monument. It’s at the foot of Hyde Street and
now consists of four ships, the schooners Wapama and
Thayer; a hay-scow, the Alma; and the world’s last “walk-
ing-beam” ferryboat, the Eureka. It also has a gas-lighted,
four-acre, lawned square with a cable car turnaround. In an-
other two years it will house a priceless collection of old rail.
road engines and equipment in the brick Haslett Warehouse,
which borders the square and has stood since before “The
Fire.” The entire project so far has cost about $2,000,000.
It is financed from impounded tidelands oil revenues which
were returned by court order to California from the federal
government.

However, long before the tidelands funds were available
to finance the project, the San Francisco Maritime Museum
Association conceived the idea of retrieving, from mudflats,
drydocks, and foreign ports, those San Francisco ships
which were still available and which indicated a period in
the state’s maritime history. Working diligently since 1958,
hand in hand with the State Park Commission, the associao
tion has pushed the program along. The museum located
the ships for the State Division of Beaches and Parks, and,
during the restoration, has acted as consultant in technical
matters and, by effective birddogging, located authentic
equipment for the vessels.

Though the ships are home, the project is not complete.
The Haslett Warehouse will be stabilized and strengthened,
so that thirty-eight pieces of historic Western rolling stock
may be housed for public exhibition.

COLORADO. The Department of the Interior has ac-
quired 8,370 acres of state-owned Colorado land located
within Dinosaur National Monument and 690 acres adjoin-
ing the monument in exchange for approximately 9,906
acres of public-domain lands that were under the jurisdic-
tion of the l S. Bureau of Land Management and located in
parcels throughout the state. Also involved in the exchange

140

are 780 acres adjoining the monument to which the federal
government has received the surface rights and the state re-
tains the mineral rights, and 840 acres within the monument
to which only the mineral rights have been transferred to
the federal government. This exchange includes 2,480 acres
of unsurveyed land. Located in northeastern Utah and
northwestern Colorado, Dinosaur National Monument con-
tains what is considered to be the most remarkable dinosaur
fossil deposit in the world and exceptional scenery in an
atmosphere of wilderness.

FLORIDA. A park right in the Everglades, nature’s sub-
tropical wonderland, is being built by the Metropolitan Dade
County Parks and Recreation Department. The square-mile
regional park, just northwest of Miami, is being developed
for outdoor family camping, fishing, boating, and picnick-
ing. Its ecology is primitive, composed of vast sawgrass
savannahs and rich in natural wildlife resources found in
the Everglades. Included are many species of native and
migratory waterfowl, wading birds, fresh-water fish, alli-
gators, otters, and interesting forms of plant growth.

The first phase of development, costing $175,000, will in-
clude filling and landscaping ten acres of land and should
be completed early this summer. This will create a paved
loop access road which will have nineteen campsites along
its perimeter. Several stocked lagoons also will be formed.
This will be Dade County’s first big new park project in
twenty-three years.

MICHIGAN. The Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority,
representing five counties in the Detroit area, will construct
a swimming pool at Metropolitan Beach along Lake St. Clair
near Mount Clemens. Kenneth L. Hallenbeck, authority di-
rector, stated that this item has appeared on every edition '
of the master plan for the 550-acre park since it was first
prepared in 1945. Tentative completion date is mid-June.
Located directly in front of the bathhouse, the pool site
will take advantage of existing facilities at the over six thou-
sand-locker bathhouse and thus a minimum number of ale
terations will be needed to adapt the facilities to the needs
of both lake and pool swimmers. The pool is six-sided in
design for general swimmers, plus a diving-L for diving
enthusiasts. The general swimmer area will be 165 feet (50
meters) in length and 95 feet in width. Water depth will
vary from three to five feet at the deepest section. Although
this area is designed to meet the demands of general swim-
mers, it will contain eight marked lanes and, therefore, will
be adaptable for Olympic-type competition or recreation
meets. The diving-L is 76 feet in length and 50 feet wide,
with water depth at twelve feet in the deepest section. In-
cluded are two 3-meter and two 1-n1eter diving hoards.
Construction of the pool will be of prestressed concrete,
the water being heated, if necessary, to maintain uniform
temperature. A glass screen eight feet high will encircle
the area, and spectator seating will be located outside the
glass screen on three sides of the pool. Underwater and area
lighting will be provided by mercury vapor lights so that
the water will retain the same aspect of color both day and

Forty-Seven Years on NBA Staff

EORGE NESBITT, director of the
G Correspondence and Consulta-
tion Department of the National
Recreation Association, retired at the
end of February. He says he thinks he
should begin to take it easier. We sus-
pect that he wants more time to play
with his five-and-a-half grandchildren,
and to experiment with that enlarger
for his films. (After vacation, he came
back with an eight-by-twelve-inch glos-
sy print of a most exotic Hower spray.
We all admired and tried to figure out
what flower it was, while George lis-
tened to our botanical guesses with a
straight face. Finally he gave his typical
chuckle and confessed that he had
photographed the underside of a Queen
Anne’s Lace umbrel found in his son’s
backyard.)

George joined the staff of NBA on
February 1, 1917. He was graduated
from Ohio State University where he
specialized in chemistry and received
his degree in chemical engineering. His
hobbies “way back when” were hiking
and photography.

At NRA, George has had his turn in
almost every phase of its services: as
a finance worker, as a district repre-
sentative, and, for many years, as head-
of the Correspondence and Consultation

Department. His signature is probably
better known than that of any other

person on the staff—his department’s
outgoing mail in 1963 was around four-

Elizabeth E. Murray
LITTLE GIRL stood entranced by
A the pattern and the music of

raindrops that spattered across
the top of a mud puddle. Now and then
her right boot stole forward, to make
a splash and water rings of its own.
She stood in quiet observation for a
few moments, then lifted her face to
feel the rain fall on it, shutting her eyes
and sticking out her tongue to catch a
drop or two and taste them. In a mo-
ment she was skipping across the wet
grass, squishing her boots in little spots
of mud.

The sun came out; the clouds broke
apart to uncover a rich blue sky. An—
other little girl discovered the same
puddle, only it was not the same at all.
It was a magic mirror with reflections
of the bright colors above it. If she
leaned over, she could see herself framed
by the clouds and sky. Squatting down,
she found she could rufile the whole
picture if she blew on the water: it was
like a big wind on a lake. She tried to
make friends with the big green frog
who had also come to this puddle.
Finally the two of them bounded off
together, the frog one hop ahead of the
little girl.

Here were two little girls, perhaps
eight or nine years old, discovering
moments of joy and inspiration in a
puddle of water. They did not care how
wide or how deep it was, why a puddle

TIME TO ENJOY

A Campfire Girl leader reminds us

of children’s joy in discovering
the simple wonders of nature for themselves

should be in this particular place, what
caused the reflections or why it rained.
Maybe they would later question some
adult who could explain these wonders,
but, in the moments I had observed
them, they were simply enjoying what
was there for them to find.

Have you looked in a puddle recent-
ly? Does it look the same as it did when
you were nine? Or have you, like most
of us, lost the ability to enjoy without
being critical of imperfections, feeling
self-conscious or inhibited in using your
imagination?

Little girls are curious and imagina-
tive; adult leaders and counselors can
help them use these qualities. Outdoor

 

experiences that seem too simple to be
important can enrich the life of each
individual and lead to happy group
activities.

Organized outdoor projects such as
hikes, overnights, cookouts, and nature
crafts are important group activities
and have great value. But do not forget
to take time for the everyday things
around us which offer riches in seeking
beauty and inspiration. We must be
sensitive to the child’s scale of values
and willing to understand and share

their world. We can help them create
loveliness, or we can shatter joy with
facts and labels which tend to show our
own need to feel important and superior
in knowledge.

One group of girls started on an ex-
ploration hike to see what they could
find in the woods. They stopped to
examine a fallen log and spent an hour
in fascinated study of the mosses and
plants growing on it. After watching a
lovely sunset in quiet appreciation, they
left the rest of the woods to be explored
another day. Their leader was wise
enough to readjust plans and to allow,
when their interest was aroused, an un-
hurried hour of learning and pleasure.

Have you ever played house outdoors
with the girls, making acorn cups and
leaf dishes or grass dolls? Or made
a house under the sumac or lilacs or in
the tall grass? Or found a good climbing
tree or logs to sit on for storytelling?
Have you played singing games or folk—
danced on the grass, or made sand
castles on the beach or dirt towns in the
backyard? Sand and dirt “feel good”
between the fingers and toes. The role
of the adult in these activities is often
to start the creative play and stimulate
the imaginations of youngsters, then
sometimes to share in their play, or
sometimes to withdraw quietly but to
be near if needed.

You will find satisfaction and inspi-
ration for yourself and the children if
you open this door to the everyday
world and take time to enjoy it. Whether
you are a leader of a group in town,
a guardian in group camping, or a day—
or resident—camp counselor, you have
this opportunity. #

o ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE. A new portable lectern
with built-in sound system needing no wires and no plug-in
was originally designed for rugged military use with the
United States Chaplains’ Corps. This lectern can go any-
where outdoors or in———track meets, commencement exer-
cises, play days, auditoriums, gymnasiums. It also can plug
into AC or DC current if available. Easily portable (weighs
only thirty-nine pounds), the lectern has collapsible legs
-which withdraw into a suitcase-shaped container. The uni-
directional microphone eliminates side noise and folds into
the top of the lectern when not in use. A big ten-inch speaker
reproduces true fidelity sound while the electronics system
is made to precise engineering standards. The sound mech-
anism of the Utronic Lect-tern‘shuts off automatically when
the case folds up, thereby avoiding unnecessary battery
drain. Full information on this new Lect-tern can be ob-

tained from Thomas Finn, Utronics, Inc., 12 Franklin Ave-
nue, Clinton, New York.

0 TEE OFF. A portable golf
driving and practice cage,
made of strong steel tubing,
two-plyheavy-duty canvas duck
and netting, is easy to assem-
ble and ideal for use by rec-
reation centers and areas, driv-
ing ranges, gymnasiums,
schools, institutions, shopping centers, and armed-forces in-
stallations. The attachment of the cage in a floating position
safeguards against ricocheting of the ball from the steel
framing. The bottom of the cage is made secure for recov-
ering of all golf balls. The size of the unit is 12'-by-11’-by-9'
high with provisions for the cage to be extended to 17’ in
length by 11’-by-9’. The cage has an adjustable front open-
ing flared to fifteen feet wide. Accessories for the practice
golf cage include a 9’-by-11’ green jute matted rug for use
inside the cage to keep the golf balls from falling out after
dropping from the target. For further information and
prices on purchase or rental of this unit write to Howard

Ehmke Manufacturing Company, Bclfield Avenue and Wis-
ter Street, Philadelphia.

 

0 BIG LIFT. A new Tower-Lift attachment designed for use
with the Napco Crab Tractor can be carried to the job-site in
the loader bucket and, within fifteen minutcs, the Crab
Tractor can be changed from loader to Tower Lift operation,
offering day-long multiple production, ranging from all
types of digging with the inountcd back-hoe, as well as back-
fill work with the loader bucket. aftcr which thc Napco Cral)

Tower-Lift can go easily into action hoisting material to
floor levels on the construction site. As a result, no time is
lost waiting fOr equipment to come from other job sites, thus
production hours can be increased thirty percent. With
twenty-five hundred-pound capacity, Napco Crab Tower-
Lift is capable of handling construction material to an ele-
vation of 2214 feet. Other special features of the Napco
Crab Tower-Lift include four speed ranges, four wheel drive,
and four wheel steering. For further information write to

Napco Industries, P. O. Box 570, Minneapolis 40.

0 ON THE BEAM. New floodlight has a rectangular beam
with a sharp cutoff on all four sides to control the light spe-
cifically on the target area. The center of intensity can be
adjusted to obtain uniform intensity on the target. The
2000- to SOOO-watt lamps enable targets to be lighted up to
five hundred feet away or more. Because of the high power,
fewer Hoodlights are required, which means saving in in-
stallation and maintenance costs. Floodlights can be placed
in locations farther back or out of the way of target vision.

The horizontal or vertical setting of the rectangular beam
and the sharp cutoffs prevent light spillage on adjoining
buildings when used on playing fields, golf courses and driv-
ing ranges, parking lots, monuments, swimming pools, et
cetera. For further information on Infranor INA-11 flood-
lights, write to Infranor of North America, Inc., 742 Worth-
ington Ridge, Berlin, Connecticut.

0 WHAT’S IN A GAME? A
new table game called Back
up Three has a long his-
tory. In 1957, when War-
ren and Mary Lea Bailey
of World Wide Games
were at the Juniper Springs
_ Camping Area in Ocala
 National Forest, Florida.
 they heard of a game called
Aggravation. Later they

  

heard about the same game from many other sources and
found it was also called Frustration, Rawhide, Skipjack,
Don’t Get Mad,_Dog/zouse, and so forth. They also found
mimeographed instructions for the same game, under the
name Round the World, issued by the National Recreation
Association many years ago. Finally they have marketed
their own version. Howcver, they would be happy to get
further background information or variations in rules. For
a catalogue of ancient and modern games from many lands
as well as more on Back up Three, write to World Wide

Games, Radnor Road, Delaware, Ohio 43015.

NEWS

Mrs. Theresa S.

Brungardt, state
director of recrea-
tion for Vermont
for o v e r twenty
years, retired the
end of February.
She was given this
important pioneering responsibility as
the result of the Vermont Governor’s
First State Conference on Recreation in
1943,” and held this post under the State
Council of Safety for several years prior
to the creation of the present Vermont
State Board of Recreation in March
1937.

Her efforts have greatly raised the
level of public recreation in the state,
and her influence, far from being con-
fined to Vermont, is nationwide in
scope because of her professional activ-
ity in the national recreation movement.
She has served as national recreation
chairman of the Congress of Parents
and Teachers and her participation and
counsel have been invaluable in semi-
nars on rural recreation and in such na-
tional meetings as the White House

 

Conference on Aging.

Hailing from New Jersey as “Tess
Schmidt,” this charming lady, while
still in her teens, oined the staff of the
Playground and Recreation Association
of America, now the National Recrea-
tion Association, during the hectic pe-
riod of World War 1. Her service of
thirteen years with the Association, in-
cluding her excellent recreation promo-
tion work in Greenville, South Carolina,
laid the groundwork for a rewarding
recreation career of which she has rea-
son to be very proud. She is succeeded
in her Vermont post by Howard Jef-
frey, former executive director of the
American Recreation Society.

P. B. Nelson was recently promoted
from flying officer to flight lieutenant
at the Royal Canadian Air Force station
at Goose Bay, Labrador, where he is

IN MEMORIAM

 

o DANIEL CHASE of Jackson Heights,
New York, died in February at the age
of seventy-eight. Mr. Chase had de-
voted his life to promoting sportsman-
ship and recreation. He had recently
retired as president of the Sportsman
Brotherhood and as executive director
of the Park Association of New York
City. A star athlete at the University of
Maine, Mr. Chase later became director
of athletics at Hamilton College and
Connecticut State College, and New
York State supervisor of physical edu-
cation. He organized the Catholic
High School Athletic Association in
New York State and was manager of the
New York City Baseball Federation, a
sandlot league for youngsters. Typical
of his many speeches was his declara-
tion:

“We need more sports, not less. But
sports for developing sportsmanship,
for developing friendship, understand-
ing, and goodwill; not Sports just for
gate receipts, nor sports mainly for pub-
lic entertainment.”

0 Curve TARQUINIO, former director of
recreation in Barre, Vermont, died sud-
denly in January at the age of forty-five.
He became assistant director in Barre

in 1937 and was director from 1945
until he resigned in 1956. He was an
active member of the Vermont Recrea-
tion Society and for a number of years
its treasurer. He loved young people,
he loved teaching, but recreation was
his great interest and love. His influ-
cnce on the lives of many young peeple
was far reaching.

NEW MEXICO. Gov. Jack M. Campbell recently dedi-
cated the new $150,000, 7,500-foot-long double Chairlift—
one of the nation’s longest—at Sandia Peak Ski Area in
Cibola National Forest near Albuquerque. The Chairlift,
which will operate on a year-round basis, for tourists in the
summer and skiers in the winter, was opened during the
New Mexico State Fair to give visitors a chance to view the
panorama of more than ten thousand square miles visible
from the top of the mountain.

The Sandia mountains form the eastern city limits of Al-
buquerque, the lower terminal of the 166-chair lift is located
at the base of the ski area, just twenty-five minutes driving
time from Albuquerque’s “motel row.” Riding to the top,
spectators glide silently through green pine forests and
Aspen groves to “Sandia Summit House,” five thousand
feet above the city. The Summit House restaurant and ski

shop opened December 1.

NORTH CAROLINA. National and state parks and for-

ests situated from seacoast to mountains in North Carolina
drew more visitors in 1963 than during any other year in
their history. Combined visitor count for the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park, Blue Ridge Parkway, four North
Carolina national forests, twelve state parks, and the Cape
Hatteras National Seashore in 1963 was 19,271,905, accord-
ing to attendance figures from the State Parks Division, Na-
tional Park Service, and Forest Service of the US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. This represented a gain of 1,587,981
over the total visitations to these attractions in 1962. 1

Cape Hatteras National Seashore on the Outer Banks is-
lands of Bodie, Hatteras, and Ocracoke was host to 873,281
visitors in 1963, an increase of 34.5 percent over 1962. N a-
tional Park Service reports show that over 244,000 of the
1963 visitors camped in the national seashore. Visitation
to Hatteras increased sharply after the bridge across Oregon
Inlet was opened on November 20, 1963, indicating an up-
swing in attendance is in prospect for the current year.

The Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, which meet near Cherokee, were again the
most popular of all areas administered by the National Park
Service throughout the fifty states. They had a combined
total attendance of 12,492,672 in 1963. Parkway attendance
for the year was 7,233,872, a gain of 11.17 percent over
1962. Smokies Park attendance was 5,258,800, or 48,800
more than in 1962.

North Carolina’s twelve state parks attracted 1,817,152
visitors in 1963, as compared with 1,628,769 in 1962. Fort
Macon State Park, on the central coast near Morehead City

MARCH. 1964

and Beaufort, counted 53 7,328, and there were 346,940 vis-
itors to Mount Mitchell State Park atop the highest mountain
in Eastern America.

Preliminary 1963 attendance figures for the North Caro-
lina national forests—Pisgah and N antahala in the moun-
tains, Uwharrie in the Piedmont, and Croatan on the coastal
plain—show an overall increase of ten percent over 1962.
Total visits during the past year were 4,088,800, with Pisgah
National Forest accounting for over three million.

In addition, substantial attendance gains were reported
for state historic sites and for Fort Raleigh National His-
toric Site on Roanoke Island, and Wright Brothers National
Memorial near Kitty Hawk. Fort Raleigh, where the first
English settlements in the New World were attempted in
1585 and 1587, was visited by 136,712 travelers in 1963—
23.6 percent more than during the previous year. Wright
Memorial, marking the birthplace of aviation, drew 249,732
visitors in 1963, a gain of 11.7 percent over 1962.

As North carolina celebrated the three hundredth anni-
versary of the Carolina Charter in 1963, state historic sites
from mountains to coast were expanded and visitation in-‘
creased. Town Creek Indian Mound, on the site of an an-
cient Indian ceremonial center in the southern Piedmont
drew 46,450 visitors in 1963, a gain of 3,306 over the previ-L
ous year. Brunswick Town State Historic Site on the south-
eastern coast was visited by 26,000, a gain of a thousand
over 1962. Other historical attractions also recorded in--
creased attendance in 1963, as did scenic and recreation at-
tractions in various localities throughout the state.

“The air account is overdrawn when
one man uses 300 horsepower just to

is interesting to contemplate that reduc-

present exhaust control program over

the next ten to fifteen years—and at a
saving rather than at cost.”

The Quiet Crisis, Stewart l. Udall.
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 383 Mad-
ison Avenue, New York 10017. Pp.
191. $5.00.

“Is a society a success if it creates
conditions that impair its finest minds
and make a wasteland of its finest land-
scapes?” asks Secretary of the Interior
Stewart L. Udall in his foreword. “What
does material abundance avail if we
create an environment in which man’s
highest and most specifically human at-
tributes cannot be fulfilled?”

Mr. Udall traces the history of our
nation’s relationship between man and
land and tells the story of the quiet con-
servation crisis of the 1960’s. It is a
strong plea to the American people to
accept and be awake to the responsibili-
ties of their stewardship of our shrink-
ing open spaces. He asks us to make
America “a green and pleasant—and
productive—land,” and a land where
every man may continue to enjoy “the
spiritual exhilaration of the wilder-
ness.”

An introduction contributed by Pres-
ident John F. Kennedy voices his per-
sonal concern for the conservation of
America’s natural resources. He espe-
cially pointed out the chapter “Conser-
vation and the Future,” and said, “The
crisis may be quiet, but it is urgent. We
must do in our day what Theodore
Roosevelt did sixty years ago and
Franklin Roosevelt thirty years ago; we
must expand the concept of conserva-
tion to meet the imperious problems of
the new age.” As Secretary Udall points
out, “It is significant that two of Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy’s pieces of pio-
neering legislation have involved our
cities: an act providing financial aid to
urban areas for the acquisition of open
space and a pr0posal to assist cities in
solving their mass transit problems.”

An illuminating chapter on “Cities
in Trouble” discusses urban park and
open-space programs. Secretary Udall
applauds the daring foresight of the
National Capital Commission of Can-
ada and French designer Jacques Cre-
her in developing Ottawa as “a metro-
politan area that would be regarded as

a model by [Frederick Law] Olmstead
himself. About 300,000 people live next
door to more than 100,000 acres of su-
perb parkland and green space that pro-
vide a permanent corridor of natural
beauty for the capital city of Canada.”

In keeping with its subject matter,
this book is beautifully bound and il-

Nature Recreation: Group Guidance
for the Out-of-Doors. William (“Cop'n
Bill") Gould Vinal. Dover Publications,
180 Varick Street, New York 10014.
Pp. 310, illustrated. Paper, $1.75.

Back in 1940, “Cap’n Bill” Vinal’s
book Nature Recreation was first pub-
lished. It has probably had more effect
upon nature and camp leaders and pro-
grams than any other one book. It is
a joyful occasion to report that it has
been revised and is now available in a
plastic-coated inexpensive volume.

Here is a book to be savored, to be
picked up and read, then left handy for
the next free moment. It is provocative
because Cap’n Bill first and foremost is
a teacher. He asks questions and shows
how to find the answers. He points out,
but leaves the obvious deduction to the
leader. Above all, he is concerned that
children should have early, accurate.
and pleasant outdoor experiences; that

natural areas and resources be enjoyed
but protected; that wildlife be under-
stood and respected. Here is the phi-
losophy of a real nature educator.

A. M. C. White Mountain Guide. Ap-
palachian Mountain Club, 5 Joy Street,
Boston. Pp. 508, illustrated by pocket,
page, and sectional maps. $5.00.

With the permanent interest in trail
tramping and moantain climbing, plus
the impetus given them by the Presi-
dent’s interest in fitness, this seven-
teenth edition of this valuable guide will
be very helpful to individuals and
groups who wish to combine outdoor
adventure with physical fitness. It is
very possible that many novices will
find their first projects in this book. It
is very possible that more experienced
hikers and climbers will try to become
eligible for the Four Thousand Footer
Club. To climb. on foot, to the forty-
six summits on the ofiicial list is no
mean achievement, and one that will
never be forgotten. For those who for
one reason or another have left physical
exertion behind, this guide makes ex-
cellent reading and will provide vicari-
ous enjoyment.

Programs in Outdoor Education, Wil-

Burgess Publishing Company, 426
South Sixth Street, Minneapolis 15. Pp.
458, illustrated. $5.75.

The authors give outdoor education
a wide and practical interpretation. In
suggested activities for kindergartners,
for example, they list such simple things
as watching squirrels gather food, feel-
ing the texture of bark, playing in the
first snowfall, taking a walk to see other
pe0ple’s flowers, lawns, and trees. These
are specific details so often taken for
granted or not seen as possibilities.
They provide enlightening information
that points the way for a teacher or
leader who has not figured out for him-

-self how he can advance a child’s in-

terest in the outdoors through such
simple means. The authors are con-
cerned about what youngsters learn,
what teachers and leaders can teach.
They are aware that specializations of
interest may blind teachers and leaders
as to the endless and rich supply of re-
source material that exists for their use
just outside the classroom door. Art, or

Ranger’s Trail and Camp Book, The,
F. William Oswald (Deganawidah).
F. W. Oswald, Publisher, New High-
way, Commach, New York. Pp. T48,
illustrated, $4.00.

This book will appeal primarily to
those who have experienced living in
the wilderness areas alone or in a small
group. It is not designed for the auto-
mobile or trailer camper, although the
sections on plant and animal life, edible
wild plants, et cetera, will interest any-
one. (Plants, trees, and animals are
given a good deal of space, but not
much mention is made of birds.) Mr.
Oswald’s “cardinal rules” of safety are
valuable, and his observations about
clothing, tools, et cetera, are helpful.

We wish he had made conservation
more important. Edible wild plants
should not be picked unless it becomes
necessary. Trees should not be tapped
for sap unless necessary. Most of all,
areas where anyone may “drop twelve
to fifteen (or more) young balsam or
fir or Canada hemlock trees which are
upwards of eight or ten feet in height”
just to make a sweet-smelling bed
(“which is very inflammable”) are not
often available to campers and we won-
der if such activities are allowed in
state and national parks. We wonder
even more if campers should be en-
couraged to use our natural resources
when it is not necessary to do so. In
pioneer days there was the problem of
actual survival. Today, with excellent
and lightweight equipment and supplies
available, it is not necessary to “live
off the land” in order to enjoy it. A
specialist, like the author, may know
how to live in the woods without injury
to the ecology of the area, but the aver-
age hiker or camper should be taught
what to take into the woods and how
to use it, rather than exploit our wild
areas, the loss of which cannot be re-
placed.

Social Group Work: A Helping Proc—
ess, Gisela Konopka. Prentice-Hall,

Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Pp.
306. $7.95.

In a simple and clear-cut manner,
Gisela Konopka tells us how social
group work evolved, what it is, how it
functions, and how it is practiced to-
day. She describes the group work
method as:

0 A method of social work which helps
individuals to enhance their social func-
tioning through purposeful group ex-
periences and to cope more effectively
with their personal, group, or commu-
nity problems.

0 A professional effort which requires
knowledge and judgment—it cannot be
used mechanically.

o A generic method which can be used
in different settings—its beneficiaries
are both the sick and the healthy. The
agencies in which it is practiced span
the wide arc of health, education and
welfare organizations.

The author discusses in some detail
the application of the group work
method in public and private recreation
and leisure-time agencies, in child
welfare services, in family services, in
services to the aging, in medical and
psychiatric services, in correctional
services, and in schools of social work.
The chapter on the “Principles of Social
Group Work in Practice” is especially
recommended as it demonstrates
through the use of actual group records
how the basic principles of group work
are applied.

The book is recommended for the
library of every professional group
worker as an up-to-date authoritative
source on the subject. It should be must
reading and study for the non-profes-

sional who works with peeple in any
setting—John. Collier, Director, Park
and Recreation Department, Anaheim,

California.

Toilet Plunger

Ordinary plungers don’t seat
properly. They permit com-
pressed air and water to splash
back. Thus you not only have
a mess, but you lose the very I
pressure you need to clear the
obstruction.

With “TOILAFLEX”, ex-
pressly designed for toilets, no
air or water can escape. The
full pressure plows through the
clogging mass and swishes it
down. Can’t miss!
