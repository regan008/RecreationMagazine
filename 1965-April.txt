THE PRODUCTION of things in great abundance, in the era just en
thought essential to happiness.

So we rushed and hurried in our manufacture of things. We prod
such abundance that we cared not for waste. We were swept along in Q
carnival of wasting things easily produced.

Now we see that enduring satisfactions are not mainly dependent up
ing many things—in great quantity. ‘

We are turned back upon ourselves-"whether our capital resources bed
or small; we are turned back upon what is within us—upon our own skin
own capacities, upon what we can do rather than upon what we have or 

The playground is primarily a place for developing power to do. 5"
ming, skating, running, playing games, acting, singing, making kiteu
model airplanes, observing nature, are not dependent on costly materiQ
rather upon power to do, upon individual skill. "

Helpingthe individual child to do well and happily what he most waI
do now and will want to do later—is preeminently the task of the playg

So in this changing from the old industrial era of overproduction of
to the new era in which there isito be thought for the consumer—for HI
for culture—we turn more than before to the playgrounds and the play Id]

We think, what is it that men, women, children most like to do when [16
free to do what they please, what activity gives the most enduring satisf"
what is the minimum of facilities needed; but even more, what is the p‘
under leadership that will give a degree of mastery, of achievement, tl‘
make possible the maximum of satisfaction? "

We turn to the playground as a means of fitting children through th
happy activities to acquire habits of “living” every day, every week
year, habits that not only give skill and self-control for a future always
but which right in the present, at very low cost, give within themselves
for life eternal, vital living, for keeping young. -

Mastery over living may in considerable measure be independent
one possesses outside oneself—if one has been led from childhood to
enough within. The development of activity, skills, power, vitality, w
the preeminent task of the one who leads children in their play.

More and more in the new era, play leaders and parents will work t
in doing just this—making to children the greatest possible gift—-the 
the power to have the center of one’s own doing, one’s own living, any

control, within and notwithout oneself.

January 6, 1965 the Pacific
twest Water Plan was introduced

for the construction of a pair of
which will back the waters of the

reation Department has named James
E. Webster to a newly created con-
sultant post. Mr. Webster was formerly
director of parks in Kirkland, Wash-
ington.

D o r o t h e a
Lensch, director
of recreation for
the Bureau of
Parks and Recre-
ation in Portland,
Oregon, was named
one of Portland’s
Ten Women of Accomplishment for
1964. She has been director in Port-
land since 1938. Commented the Oregon
Journal, “Dorothea Lensch can go from
a modern dance class to a boxing match
with ease. She can discuss the Opera
Association in one breath and get ex-
cited about lawn bowling in the next.
Whether it is baton twirling or weaving
classes, bridge lessons or weight lifting,
Miss Lensch knows exactly how each
municipal program is functioning at all
times. [She is] never too busy to listen
to a problem or take time to explain a
philosophy . . . Professionally, Dorothea
Lensch operates a big business-~recre-
ation for Portland [26,000 volunteers
per year work on various Portland pro-
grams]. Personally, she is an individual
of great achievement.”

 

Peter Ranich of South Bend, Indiana,
has been appointed technical assistant
to the United Automobile Workers’ rec-
reation director, Olga Madar. In mak-
ing the announcement, Miss Madar
said, “His experience and knowledge of
the broad field of recreation, as well as
his background as an assembly—line
worker at the Studebaker plant, will

PROGRESS REPOR T 0N MERGER

OLLOWING the Chicago meeting
F of December 5, 1964. (an-
nounced in. December, 1964 issue of
RECREATION), a meeting of board
representatives of the American
Institute of Park Executives, Amer-
ican Recreation Society, National
Conference of State Parks, and
National Recreation Association was
held in Oglebay Park, Wheeling,
West Virginia, on February 28-
March 1. The boards of the AIPE,
ABS, and NRA have now approved
a merger, and the new organization
will be known as the National Rec-
reation and Park Association. The
NCSP has resolved to “explore pos-
sibilities of the conference federat-
ing with other park and recreation
organizations to strengthen park
conservation while keeping the iden-

tity of the NCSP. . . .”

It appears, therefore, that the
merger is “off and running” and the
end objective is within reach. The
meeting was chaired by Robert W.
Ruhe of the Skokie, Illinois, Park
District. Present were: Frank Vay-
dik, AIPE; Robert A. Lobdell,
AlPE; Howard W. Gregg, AIPE;
Alfred B. LaGasse, AIPE; Stewart
G. Case, ARS; Sidney G. Lutzin,
ARS; Edward H. Thacker, ARS;
Ray R. Butler, ARS; Ben H. Thomp-
son, NCSP; Donald B. Alexander,
NCSP; Dr. Luther Gulick, NRA;
Robert W. Crawford, NRA; and
Joseph Prendergast, NRA.

A calendar of dates for action, in
accordance with agreements reached

at the meeting, lines up briefly as
follows:

1. Immediately, Messrs. Butler
and LaGassc will proceed to deve10p
a draft of constitution and bylaws
for the Board of Governors, and Mr.
Prendergast will proceed to develop
a draft of the lay division for sub-
mission to the to-be-formed Board
of Directors. Mr. Prendergast will
also draft a constitution and bylaws

for the NRPA together with neces-

. 1.965

sary charter revisions of the NRA
with consultation of the other execu-
tives. All of these drafts will be co-
ordinated by the executives into one
document and submitted to each
member of the Joint Committee for
information and comment.

2. Prior to April 1, 1965, all rec-
ognized national organizations cur-
rently active in the park and recrea-
tion field are to be extended the op-
portunity to join the NRPA as one
of the founding organizations. In-
terested and qualified organizations
are to indicate their interest to Mr.
Ruhe, chairman of the Joint Com-
mittee on Merger and appoint
appropriate representatives. (Mr.
Ruhe’s address: Director, Skokie
Park District, 4400 Grover Street,
Skokie, Illinois 60077.)

The reSpectivc heads of profes-
sional organizations are to indicate
the names of their founders on the
Board of Governors and their pref-
erence for a place and date for the
first meeting of this group.

3. By May 4, 1965, the Board of
Governors will act on the action

documents proposed by the execu-
tive directors.

The Board of Directors of the lay
division will convene under the di-
rection of James Evans, Chairman,
Board of Trustees, National Recrea-
tion Association, for purposes iden-
tical with those of the Board of
Governors.

4. Prior to June 1, 1965, the or-
ganizations joining in this merger
shall ratify the action of the Board
of Directors or Board of Governors
as it affects their rcSpective interest,
lay or professional, together with the
document as it relates to the Board
of Trustees. Notification or ratifica-
tion is to be sent to Mr. Evans since
he is chairman of the National Rec-
reation Association which will
amend its charter to incorporate in-
to the National Recreation and Park
Association.

5. As rapidly as possible, the
Board of Directors of the lay divi-
sion is to select the laymen it wishes
to have serve on the Board of Trus-
tees, and is to notify Mr. Vaydik, Mr.
Case, and Mr. Wirth, if the National
Conference on State Parks joins the
professional division, so the Board
of Governors can avoid duplicating
names of laymen already selected.

6. Prior to July I, 1965, Mr.
Evans will be responsible for estab-
lishing a date and place for the
Board of Trustees meeting and for
temporarily presiding until a perma-
nent chairman is elected.

7. By July 1, 1965, those organ-
izations ratifying the “Plan for
Merger” shall take the necessary
action to transfer properties and
and take all legal steps necessary
to effectuate the merger into the Na-
tional Recreation and Park Associa-
tion. Continuing obligations of the
founding organizations shall be as-
sumed by the National Recreation
and Park Association.

Definitions of the terms layman

and professional, to be referred to

the Board of Trustees for further
consideration, are:

Layman—a person who is not cur-
rently employed in gaining his live-
lihood in the field of parks and rec-
reation and who is eligible for mem-
bership of the lay division of the

National Recrcation and Park As-
sociation.

Professional—a person who is ac-
tually engaged in gaining his liveli-
hood in the field of parks and recrea-
tion and who is eligible for member-

) WITH THE SIGNING of the Appalachia
Bill (P.L.89-4) on March 9 President
Johnson set into motion a $1,100,000,-
000 program to invigorate the lagging
economy in depressed areas in eleven
states. The major thrust of the Appa-
lachia legislation will be to open up
areas of growth potential by building
new highways, making areas with in-
dustrial potential and recreation poten-
tial more accessible. The program also
includes grant-in-aid funds for con-
struction of colleges, vocational schools,
sewage-treatment plants, and airports.

) A SEVEN-DOLLAR annual fee for the
new federal Recreation/Conservation
sticker will enable five million Ameri-
cans to save on admission fees to most
federal recreation areas, including the
areas administered by National Park
Service, Bureau of Land Management,
Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wild-
life, Bureau of Reclamation, the Forest
Service, Army Corps of Engineers,
Tennessee Valley Authority, and the
U. S. Section of the International
Boundary and Water Commission

(US. and Mexico).

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

} THE WORD “Recreation” is now
added to the title of the Subcommittee
on National Parks [and Recreation],
according to a recent announcement by
Lawrence N. Stevens, associate director
of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.
“We are especially happy that ‘Recrea
tion’ has become a full partner. . . . ’
he stated, “It indicates recognition of

the full spectrum of the outdoor recrea-
tion field.”

) MEMORIAL. On the death of Clarence
E. Brewer on December 25, 1964, Mr.
Brewer’s family (wife and three sons)
requested that contributions be made to
the National Recreation Association in
lieu of flowers. Contributions have been
received from neighbors, associates of
David Whitney Brewer at the Detroit
Public Library, associates of Donald C.
Brewer at the RCA Plant in Camden,
New Jersey, and friends of Fred S.
Brewer of Trenton, Michigan. Accord-
ingly, the NRA has established the
Clarence E. Brewer Memorial Fund as
part of its endowment. It was requested
that “the money be used to aid the

program on behalf of the ill and handi-
capped.”

resources—twenty-two lakes dotted
over the 5,554 acres of its 153 parks-—
to establish a topnotch water-based pro-
gram. Whether as participant or spec-
tator, many thousands of Minneapolis
citizens each year take part in and en-
joy the varied recreation opportunities.’

Come summer, there is nothing quite
like a dip in a cool city lake on a hot
day. Swimming is popular in Minne-
apolis. Pools are fine and Minneapolis
has one. However, in most cities pools
serve as the only source for water sports.
In Minneapolis, the beauty and the
great practical use of the many in-town
lakes makes this recreation activity a
particularly enjoyable one. A million
and a half swimmers used the sixteen
supervised beaches last summer.

Water activities are not confined to
the swimmers. Sailboating and canoe-
ing have their active followers. A fam-
iliar weekend scene on Calhoun, locat-
ed only ten minutes from the heart of
the loop, is a billowing skyline of sail-
boats competing in supervised regattas.
And what could offer a more romantic
setting for a young couple than taking
a canoe ride at sundown on Lake of the
Isles? It happens every day in Minne-
apolis.

During the winter, ice-skating facili-
ties are maintained at seventy rinks,
fifty-seven of which have warming
houses. Ice boating and fishing are
popular sports on the frozen lakes, and
the sloping terrain of the parks offers
a natural setting for tobogganing. Min-
neapolis has one of the three Olympic-
sized speed skating tracks in the coun-
try, located on Lake Harriet. Olympic
trials and frequent national and inter-
national meets are held here, including
the colorful 10,000 Lakes meet each
February. Over two hundred local skat-
ers from seven clubs compete in meets

each Saturday and Sunday. An annual
feature, over the Christmas holidays, is
the Silver Skates event, which has
launched many youngsters on speed-
skating careers.

Skiing seems to be gaining momen-
tum everywhere these days, and no-
where does it _command a more active
or dedicated group than in Minne-
apolis. The park board maintains two
lighted ski slides and a rope tow at
Theodore Wirth Park. Co-recreational
classes in the park board ski school,
recognized as one of the country’s fin-
est, are held each evening and Satur-
days. Last winter, the number of ski
students reached 827 adults and 502
juniors, with a total participation of
10,953. Ski jumping meets, held each
Sunday in conjunction with private
clubs, attracting over a hundred skiers
from the Upper Midwest area. John

Balfanz, a member of the US. Olym-
pic ski jumping team, got his start at

Wirth.

Hockey is another popular winter 

sport in this northern climate. Minne-
apolis has thirty-three'lighted outdoor
rinks. In its playground sports program
there are 167 boys teams playing over
six hundred scheduled games. Because
of the wide number of youths compet-
ing on high-school and college teams
in the city, it is important to maintain
a program where they can continue to
play hockey after graduation. There
are, as a result, forty-five sponsored
adult teams in Minneapolis, which play
down to an annual state senior tourna-
ment at the arena.

OTHER OUTDOOR facilities in Minne-
apolis are also in heavy use. Pub-
lic links golf in Minneapolis has en-
joyed a long and historic tradition. The
park board maintains five 18-hole mu-
nicipal courses and one 9-hole par-3
course, which accommodated a total of
276,991 rounds in 1964. So great is the
weekend traffic at Gross, Hiawatha,
Meadowbrook, Wirth, and Columbia
courses that reservations start at 6 AM.
The condition of these courses is a
source of pride to all city golfers. Last
year the National Public Links tourna-
ment was conducted at Gross, attract-
ing a splendid field from forty-seven
states and daily galleries of enthusias-
tic fans.

ing at the University of Stockholm.
“It’s a great help to know that my child
is in safe hands while I’m attending
classes.”

The parks have myriad activities to
amuse the young ones, including craft
classes, art and sport contests, organ-
ized games, and play productions, plus
all the regular playground facilities.
The plays given by the children under
the direction of the playground leader
are among the most fascinating activi-
ties at the parks. They are given in
Open-air theaters with simple and effec-
tive sets. Audiences never fail to ap-
preciate the youngsters’ spirited per-
formances. The city park system has
props and costumes for such children’s
plays as “Snow White,” “Sleeping
Beauty,” and “Little Red Riding Hood.”

Even gardening is included in the
program. Each park has its own small
garden which the children cultivate
themselves. Swedes have a great love
for flower-growing and the younger set
demonstrates the same green thumbs as
their elders.

Fenced-off play areas are reserved
for tiny tots where supervisors keep an
eye on them. The supervisors have the
names and addresses of all the younger
children that come to the park, as each
mother signs in her child, so that the
attendant will know who is present.

Many parks are large enough to have
their own playing fields, often used for
soccer, a favorite Swedish sport. Be-
sides soccer, Ping-Pong is very popular.
Young Swedes play a special variety of
Ping-Pong, where several contestants
walk around the table, each taking
one swat at the ball. The winner is the
one who has not made any mistakes—
the others are eliminated, one by one.

The biggest difficulty the recreation
program has encountered is finding
suitable playground leaders. The sal-
aries, which begin at $262 a month to
a maximum of 3306, are not especially
attractive to men; consequently all but
a few applicants are women. Women
with experience in handling children in
outdoor groups are preferred, with ap
proximately six out of ten applicants
being chosen. Of these, about a third

and new equipment organized into several areas along with
sandpits and shower basins.

The analysis of a New York City playground requires
the careful consideration of many factors. The average
site should, and, in fact, generally must, serve all age groups.
Several activities need areas about as standard as the metric
bar in Paris. Softball, basketball, and handball courts for
teenagers, forcibly squared up to the city’s rigid street pat-
tern and enclosed by fencing, are natural targets for critics
of the great expanses of pavement. In the remainder of the
playground, the designer has much more freedom.

As a pilot project, plans have recently been studied for a
typical three-acre city block. An asphalt softball area is
dished in the center for artificial freezing for ice skating.
At one end, the field is surrounded by trees and grass areas.
At the other end, a raised platform for a pleasant sitting area
serves as a shelter with trees growing up from below through
holes in the surface. At the center of the area, a 50’-by-100’
swimming pool, sculpture grove, and children’s areas are
planned both above and below grade. A recreation building
for the pool has gamerooms opening off the platform at the
second floor. Other studies include bridging streets with
wide bridges similar to the above platform design.

Changes are being made in building, shelter, apparatus,
and bench design. Surfacing and color are being studied.
Utility details will not be revised except in relation to new
materials and construction methods.

The city park department respects the standards that
served so well but recognizes that it is time for change. The
designer will have new standards but still the right and

duty to use them with imagination.—-NEWBOLD MORRIS,

POWER-LINE PLAYGROUND

THE Southern California Edison Company has a system
of transmission right-of-ways emanating from the
Huntington Beach generating station. They pass through
the cities of Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, West-
minster, Garden Grove, Anaheim, Stanton, and various
parts of Orange and other counties throughout Southern
California. Towers are approximately a hundred feet
high and are located about 1320 feet apart. The right-of-
way owned by the Edison Company is two hundred feet
wide, and although municipal green-belt development of the
area is a relatively new departure for the company, they
have demonstrated a willingness to explore all the potential
uses of the area. They are still groping for policies to guide
this new use, but stress that any development allowed will
be based on the individual transmission needs of that par-
ticular portion of the right-of—way.

In the city of Fountain Valley the first steps into develop-
ment of a right-of-way were guided by planning director
Stan Mansfield and city administrator Ed McDonald in
1962. A subdivider agreed to participate in the plan, and
the Edison Company gave the city a lease for a ten-year
period. All future negotiations will be separate considera-
tions. A park development plan was drawn, and was ap-
proved by the city council and the Edison Company. It
was then graded and fenced by the city, while the developer
contributed $6,500 to the project. An irrigation system was
installed, grass planted, and three picnic tables, tetherball
pole, and volleyball standards added. All metal equipment
had to be grounded, adding about $20 to the installation
cost. With the addition of a recreation equipment storage
bin, the area was operated last summer as one of three city
playgrounds. A major limitation was shade and shelter, but
most activities were conducted successfully.

The area is not being used as a supervised playground
now, but Fountain Valley will install a slide, climber and
swings. Also, bids have been received for concrete walk-
ways, picnic tables, and bench pads and are awaiting coun-
cil action. Trees will be purchased, and a home-owners as-
sociation has volunteered a twelve-man crew to provide the
labor.

throughout Fountain Valley would involve forty
acres of usable land, estimated with development co ‘
$252,000. To acquire this land would cost over $3
at current land values of $23,000 per acre.

The new master park plan for Fountain Valley ca
right-of-way property adjacent to schools to be leas
developed first, hopefully in the same irrigation c
as that of the school. Other portions would be leas
developed as funds become available. Future develo
will follow an existing pattern of requesting adjacen
developers to contribute a pro-rated share of impro
costs. This pattern has met no opposition.

Five other agencies appear interested in developing
of-way areas. Anaheim has a proposed plan but has
yet presented it for Edison approval. Huntington
and Westminster are also studying possibilities withi
cities. Montebello’s plan has been approved, but it
yet moved to develop the site. The Blessed Sac
Catholic Church in Westminster is also exploring t
of the right-of-way as a school playground.

believe. The facilities for play which they contribute to the
community should be designed to ever stimulate and re-
lease the creativity inherent within each child. The basic
design, the selection of the construction materials, ultimate
color, and even the final orientation of the play pieces to
the natural environment should focus on this objective.
They should release the participant’s mental and emotional
energies as well as the physical energies.

Practical problems of safety, durability, maintenance,
and the need for supervision must still be considered and
designed into the basic play idea. Nevertheless, success of
the play concept must be predicated on the hypothesis that
these practical problems will be dealt with only after the
fundamental objective of meeting the needs and expecta-
tions of growing children has received primary considera-
tion. These concepts, although nebulous in nature, must be
approached in specific meaningful ways. This article will

deal with only four of these: shape, proportion, color, and
orientation.

SHAPE

THE basic design of equipment and areas should appeal

to the esthetic sense of sight. This is not to say that
attempts have not been made in this direction, but too often
play areas I have seen have the appearance of those insti‘
tutions generally reserved for those we have found neces-
sary to remove from society. Standards for beauty that are
accepted as a part of our culture, whether they be from the
school advocating flowing lines or the college of intricate

169

geometric pattern, should be respected. It may be necessary
to sacrifice small allotments of space so that fences, isolating
areas may follow an irregularity of pattern in keeping with
the natural environment in contrast to the traditional fenced
plots. I saw simple sand retainer walls, designed as a
symmetrical part of the play area, serving, in addition to
their primary function, as a winding challenge to the young-
sters who mount and walk on them. They also provided a
seat for the supervising mother.

The sense of touch and the pleasures associated with it
are often overlooked in an age that caters primarily to the
senses of sight and hearing. Yet we have only to watch
small children as they run their hands over irregular ob-
jects, pausing to linger where the esthetic sense is pleasing
and quickly speeding by the surface that awakens no re-
sponse, to recognize the importance of nurturing this in-
herent pleasure. This brings to my mind the beautiful
sculptured play pieces or animals that have become an im-
portant part of our better play areas. I remember a small
two-dimensional boy’s head on a restroom door where I
saw dozens of boys stop and use their index finger to trace
the irregular part through the boy’s wavy hair.

PROPORTION

THE-PRINCIPLE of proportion should receive careful con-
sideration as it is a matter of ultimate importance in
the world of the child. Equipment properly proportioned
for age groups will encourage the small youngster in his
initial play experience and still provide for an adventurous
child a more challenging point of beginning. Thus, the
child enjoys successful play experience on equipment de-
signed in keeping with his physical limitations as well as
the less tangible factors of his emotional readiness and
social development. Proportioned equipment may serve to
promote for natural divisions in age groupings as the older
child turns away from areas designed primarily for his
younger brother. This may further serve to reduce equip-

ment breakage caused by older children on undersized
equipment.

COLOR

COLOR is one of the components that should contribute
to the total objective of developing a play environment
indigenous to the local natural community while comple-
menting the play instincts of the child. Using any old color
just for the sake of color is in itself not a satisfactory cri-
teria for the haphazard paint schemes used by professionals
in the field. My trip proved to me that if color is to be a
part of the play motif, a rationale for the use of it must be
thoroughly investigated. Answers to the following ques-
tions should contribute a sound basis for using color in
play areas:

0 What colors contribute to a play atmosphere?

0 How can color assist or detract from optical propor-
tions?

0 In what ways can the use of color contribute to safety in
the play space?

0 What colors are generally complimentary to the natural
environment?

seasons.

ORIENTATION OF EQUIPMENT I”

THE SUCCESS or failure of a play area to meet the
of its participants may depend to a greater or
degree upon the orientation of the equipment. The 
of spacing to promote for maximum safety for the o i"
pants should be underscored. However, in turning
task of building a real play community, several s
principles should be observed. Swing locations that g
the youngster, as Stevenson writes, “to escape ov
garden wall” rather than face the brick apartment or I
link fence are worthy of consideraton. A small hill I
playground would be a natural location for the slide t
a young astronaut a sense of towering height as he a
the ten-foot slide ladder.

Natural depressions or prominences may serve to se
play areas in lieu of manmade barriers: Play walls an n
houses should be located away from busy walks in t
that the child may be swept along to his land of make-b .
without hearing the shouts of the astronaut as he mak '
reentry. The atmosphere should create for the chi
feeling of being an accepted intruder. Equipment -
still be in the line of sight of the professional supervi
at least in a location to receive the casual supervision r
parents in attendance.

Moulded or sculptured pieces demand similar semi-
tion, I found. The piece may be large with many sma
spaces encouraging multiple play ideas. On the other
the theme may demand severalsmall pieces that cont
to a central idea. If the latter is the case, it is importa
this equipment be physically related to permit the ch
to unfold their play role. '

Maximum use of plantings to provide for shad
beauty cannot be overlooked. Careful selection of ~
will further aid the general traffic flow. Traffic pa
should be established that permit a free flow of trach

equipment.

Equipment permitting a limited number of partic

ed 1.8 acres of a partially devel-

many years. Installations at that
consisted of a small wading pool,

in the center of the property, some
' eshoe courts, enclosed by a four—
wall. The area inside this wall

look after these younger children. Pre-
occupation with the little ones not only
deprived the older children from par-
ticipating wholeheartedly and fully in
games and other activities, but led to
constant disruption and disorganiza-
tion of games. It was imperative that
some provision be made for preschool-
ers’ activities.

The old horseshoe courts were of no

practical value since interest in this ac-
tivity had completely died out in the
neighborhood and the courts were
never used. Why not use these obso-
lete courts with their low wall as a spe-
cial “tot area”? The area was large
enough to accommodate at least forty
children, with plenty of space for their
playtime needs. Here they would be
protected from the more active and
skilled games of the older children,

completely undisturbed, and able to en-
joy a more meaningful experience.
However, almost no funds were avail-
able in the operating budget at this
time. Imagination and ingenuity, plus
weeks of hard work, salvaging of
scrapped materials, and donations of
paint solved the problem! Intrigued
and excited, the recreation leaders vol-
unteered their time and talents to the
project, and most of the work was done

by them.

THE FIRST STEP was to do something
about a mass of broken glass and
other debris. After the pitchers’ boxes
were removed, the most practical way
to clean up the area was to remove
about three feet of top material. After
this, paint seemed to be most urgent,
in order to make the area attractive and

inviting. Donations of odds and ends
of paint samples from several local
paint stores solved this need. These
samples were used to great advantage,
with many unusual results.

The wall was built of adobe bricks
covered with cement, a type of build-
ing material native to this part of the
Southwest. It was constructed of six-
teen panels with a pilaster of concrete

approximately every twelve feet, and
the entire wall was a dull dark brown
color.

When the murals were completed,
the pilasters were painted white, sepa-
rating each design, so the many colors
in each of the murals did not conflict.
Then, the outside of the wall was
painted white with the rounded top a
bright turquoise blue for contrast. The
small wooden entrance gate was painted
bright red and the gate at the opposite
side still another color. This profuse
use of color created a gay and inviting
appearance.

To brighten it up, each of the six-
teen panels was painted with a differ-
ent mural. Several were free-form de-
signs; several, broad alternating stripes;
and the balance with more realistic
characters which it was felt would in-
trigue the children. No traditional
Mother Goose or Walt Disney charac-
ters were used. Many of the designs
had a humorous twist, such as an amus-
ing octopus, with white gloves on each
of its tentacles and jaunty “Mr. Bee”
with top hat, bright weskit and cane!

WHAT TO DO about equipment? A
large surplus cement sewer cul-
vert was located. This culvert, six feet
in diameter and four feet long, weighing
almost a ton, was put in place by a
crane. Instead of placing it so that the
children could crawl through it, it was
set on end and became a playhouse. A
round Opening in one side, about two
feet in diameter, gave the appearance
of a window, and another rectangular
opening served as a small open door.
Not only could this “equipment” be
used to “play house,” but was also ex-
cellent for climbing.

Several old discarded bus stop
benches were retrieved from the city
dump. These were wooden, but had
heavy cement ends. When these were
set in place, their non‘h'ed position was

plicity of design is often the best motto.

seeurity. Children should feel secure and safe in a play-
ground—particularly small children. Security includes
shelter from the weather, facilities for adult supervision,
and physical separation of different ages and activities.
Shelter may be a roof or a wall, or simply trees overhead——
particularly good because they provide shelter without deep
shadow. Supervision means either comfortable seating for
adults or play areas designed for adult participation. Physi-
cal safety is also a part of security.

Adventure. Playgrounds should give each child the oppor-
tunity for exciting and imaginative play. Obviously the
techniques for achieving this result vary with the age group

'to be served, but the principle can be applied in each in-

stance if sufficient ingenuity is used. Copies of the pamphlet

SPECIAL

 

What do children remember after the
playground season is over or their play-
ground years are behind them? They
remember the special events and proj-
ects that made them feel like Little Jack
H orner pulling plums from the program
pie. Such events call for careful plan-
ning by the recreation staff and much
hard work by participants, parents, and
leaders. The resulting fun and festivity
is enjoyed by all. Here are some events
and projects that were real highlights.

Tootin’ Tommy

.NE MAY THINK of a napkin as simply a piece of paper
used during meals. However, the children and recre-
I leaders in Trenton, Michigan, used some fifty-five
sand napkins and chicken wire to construct a float rep-
nting the city’s recreation program in its many aspects.
float measured 35’-l)y-17’ -by-13’. Two weeks of con-
ous labor were spent on its construction. During the
few days the Quonsct hut, in which it was built, stayed
Ilatc into the night.
rrying out the theme of Trenton’s Summer Water Car-
l, the float was shaped like a tugboat complete with
king eyes, puffing stack, bellowing horn, and rocking
ion. For mobility, the float was constructed over a pick-

wire frame and hundreds of hours of work by youngsters in
Trenton, Michigan, to prepare a striking float for parades.

up truck. Many parks were supplied with sections of the
chicken-wire frame to stuff with twisted napkins. The paint-
ing took nearly two days.

A contest was initiated to name the float. Children be-
tween séven and fourteen years were allowed to enter. The
winning name was “Tootin’ Tommy,” and the winning en-
trant marched in the parades with the float.

Parades and events in which the float was featured in-
cluded the Wyandotte July 4th parade, Riverview July 5th
parade, Trenton Water Carnival, and the Trenton Carnival.
During the parades the Trenton Twirlers, a group of ma-
jorettes aged seven to sixteen, accompanied the float. The
girls, numbering fifteen in all, wore red-and-white uniforms
and carried the city banner. One of the recreation park
leaders trained the troupe at her park. In addition, they
were requested to march in the Detroit Soap-Box Derby
parades.

This was the second year of such activity in the Trenton
recreation program, and the department is looking forward
to more of these types of events—R. ERIC REICKEL, Direc-
tor of Parks and Recreation, Trenton. Michigan.

Olympic Campout

rImr; OLvMPIc GAMES are an old and revered custom in
our society. The Olympic ideal of indi\ idual and peace-
ful athletic competition has survived thousands of years
after the civilization which founded it died. The idea of a
Junior Olympics is certainly not new. Indeed, hundreds of
communities conduct such events. However. California’s
Tantau Recreation and Park District added a new and ex-
citing dimension to the Junior Olympics. using the original
Olympic customs as a model.

During the Olympic Games period it was the custom in
Greece that all wars should cease and all men should be at

175

peace. The contestants from the Greek city states would
make the trip to Olympia, site of the games, and camp out-
side the arena. Winners of the contest were crowned with
olive wreaths as a sign of their victory and were honored
in their cities. Using this idea as a starting point, the dis-
trict decided to combine an Olympics with a campout. This
was to be the major undertaking of the summer. Since Tan-
tau is a small district with a p0pulation of only about four
thousand it was decided to make the effort really worthwhile.

Registration was taken a month prior to the games. Each
registrant paid $.25 to cover the cost of his breakfast on
Olympic day. Registrants were divided into three groups,
each group having the same approximate overall skill level
determined by a trial two weeks prior to the games. Each
group had twenty boys aged eight to twelve. The eight- and
nine-year-old boys competed against each other and the ten-
to 12-year-old boys against each other. The groups were
given the names of three city states, Athens, Corinth, and
Sparta. Information on their city was given to the boys a
. week before the games. In the meantime, the arts-and-crafts
class had fashioned wreaths from plastic flower stems pur-
chased at the dime store. The wreaths were sprayed with
spray paint, gold for first, silver for second, and red for
third.

On Olympic night everything was in readiness when the
teams arrived at sunset. Sleeping gear was set up on the
lawn and park area of the district. Each team had a yell and
each had a storyteller to tell about his city. A staff member
narrated the history of the Olympic games; an outdoor
showing of the movie Bob Mathias, All-American followed;
then the campers were put to bed.

It was a long night for the director and recreation suPer-
visor. Sixty rambunctious boys can present quite a prob-
lem. The boys were awakened at 6:30 AM for breakfast.
Breakfast consisted of cereal, hot chocolate, a doughnut and
a banana. The whole meal was quickly prepared in the dis-
trict kitchen and served to the hungry youngsters. After
breakfast, the sleeping gear was gathered and stored in the
recreation hall. The teams formed for the parade to the ad-
jacent playground where the games were to be held. Run-
ning before the teams was the Olympic torch bearer carry-
ing the torch of the Olympics. The torch was made of con-
struction paper and aluminum foil.

Track and field events for the eight- and nine-year-olds
were 25-yard dash, 220 relay, broad jump, basketball putt,
softball throw, and tug-of-war. Track and field events for
the ten- and twelve-year-olds were 50-yard dash, 440-yard
relay, broad jump, basketball putt, softball throw, tug-of-
war.

Each city state was allowed to enter three men in each
individual event, one relay team and one tug-of-war team
in each class. Four places were given on a 4-3-2-1 basis.

Scores for both age classes were counted together in to-
taling the scores as well as scores given for the Olympic
Parade (five for first; three, second; one, third). Sparta
emerged the winner in points. With the winners wreathed,

LMOST OVERNIGHT, skate-board-
ing, or sidewalk surfing, became
a very popular activity with
ngsters, teenagers, and college stu-
ts in Tampa, Florida. Although surf-
, or riding and doing stunts on plat-
med roller skates, is a lot of fun
ich requires agility, coordination
a balance, it is also potentially dan-
ous to the surfer, pedestrians, and
tomobile drivers when done on the
walks. A Tampa city ordinance
es it unlawful to ride anything with
Is on the sidewalk and the chief of
ice stated that his staff would enforce

ned. It soon became apparent some-

Jamboree on each of the fifty-seven
playgrounds. (See below for specific
contests.)
‘ To allow youngsters to surf on the
basketball or tennis courts when there
were no other scheduled activities.
0 To conduct skill contests periodical-
ly when the interest and attendance in-
dicated a need for same.

Wheeljamboree parties were not re-
stricted to surfboards only but included
anything on wheels, so that more
youngsters could participate in the spe-
cial activity. Through the cooperation
of the press, radio, and TV, youngsters
and their parents were not only alerted
to the danger of sidewalk surfing, but
were informed about the challenging al-
ternative—playground surfing. Young-
sters responded by attending the spe-
cial wheeljamboree playground parties.
Now, recreation leaders are keeping
their fingers crossed that they can keep
the youngsters playground surfing in-
stead of sidewalk surfing.

Among the contests conducted dur-
ing Wheel Jamboree were:

INTRODUCT10N T0 CAMPING!

UMMER is the time when children
S should be outdoors exploring

shady woods, looking for wild-
flowers, observing birds and animals,
catching tadpoles, and watching frogs.
It is the time for hikes, smelling pine
needles, and roasting hot dogs on a
green stick, the time for dressing up like
an Indian and whittling a stick.

Some children are fortunate and ex-
perience these pleasures during the sum-
mer at a cottage or a camp; but what of
those who stay behind in the humid city
or town? Must they miss these oppor-
tunities? No! Day camping brings them
all within the means of every child.

What is day camping? It is an organ-
ized group of experience in outdoor liv-
ing on a day-by-day basis and under

trained leadership. The program should

weaves to pass on alternate sides of the
markers. Points were scored as fol-
lows: ten points for perfect execution;
one point off for each time a marker
is touched by any part of the rider or
his surfboard; half a point off for each
time the rider falls off the surfboard.

Straight line balance: Contestants ride
for thirty feet between parallel lines
four inches apart, without touching
beveled blocks placed against the lines
in pairs (twelve blocks required) at
distances of six feet. Ten points scored
for perfect execution; one point off each
time a wheel touches either line; one
point off each time a wheel rolls out-
side the line on either side; one point
off each time a wheel touches a block;
one point off each time a rider falls off

his surfboard.

BICYCLES

Water race: Contestants line up, each
with a paper cup full of water. Contest-
ants hold cup of water over the top of
their heads and race to the finish line.
Cups of the first two over the finish
line are checked and the one with the
most water in cup wins—ten points.

Blindfold race: Each blindfolded con-
testant rides until he thinks he is at the
finish line (only one contestant at a
time, for safety). The one who dis-
mounts nearest to the line wins ten
points.

he nature-centered and, wherever pos-
sible, should have a natural outdoor
setting. Day camping is:

0 An outdoor program for small groups.
0 An opportunity to develop camping
skills.

0 An introduction to camping.

Day Camping is not:

0 A playground program transplanted
in another location.

0 A vacation or stay-at-home club.

0 A building-centered program.

Last summer, with - these objectives
firmly in mind, the recreation staff in
Hamilton, Ontario, transformed its day
campers into Indian braves and prin-
cesses, each with a great sense of fellow-
ship and pride in the tribe to which he

I. ' “Is That Manual Necessary?” The following com-

are based upon those manuals that try to “cover the

books on specific activities, especially games, crafts,

'ons may help:

widely. Is it a how-to-do-it for new leaders? A shot-
' -arm? A directory? A schedule? Are you really clear
its objectives? Are they stated?

Questions to ask yourself
when you consider the resources
and materials your leaders should

have to do the job expected of them

Is it duplicating material in your department library?
If those shelves have a good collection of books, why not
put them to use? Why waste effort? Maybe it is a library
that is needed, not a manual!

Is it being used as a substitute for pre-season and in-
scrvice training, in which activities can be learned by
doing? Reading how to play jacks may teach the rules, but
it doesn’t teach the hands. Practice does that!

Is it honest? Legally honest? Ethically honest? You have
no right to copy anything out of a copyrighted book, pam-
phlet, magazine, et cetera without permission from the pub-
lishcr or copyright holder. The fact that “it’s just mimeo-
graphing,” or “it’s just for use by our own department,” or
“we don’t sell it” has nothing to do with it. Copyrighted
material cannot be reproduced in any way, for any use, ex-
cept by permission of the copyright holder. This holds true
for music, plays, stories, et cetera as well. Ignorance is no
excuse. NOW you know!

\Vho selects the contents ? How is the material evaluated?
What criteria are used for what activities? Who selects
what? Is it a rehash of last year’s manual or has it been
planned for progression in the program?

Is it just a habit now? Has the need for it declined as
leadership has become more professional? Or have you
thought about it?

How much does it arouse the interest of the leader?
Suggest new techniques? Methods of using themes? Ways
to reach the community? Or does it offer only a static frame-
work in which the leader can conduct an adequate but un-
inSpired program without any personal involvement or cre-
ative effort?

Is it the best and most efficient way of achieving what
it is designed to do? Would a kit of several smaller
“pieces” be more effective? Would better planned staff meet-
ings do the job? A better focused supervisory program?
More workshops and demonstrations?

Is it really good for the leader? Does the manual pro-
vide just enough to encourage him to use his own creative
ability? Does it regiment him? Does it discourage his use
of the best in recreation literature?

WHAT, then, should a playground manual include? The
perfect manual probably has not been written, and
the contents of a good manual may vary in different com-
munities, under different circumstances. Indeed, it should
vary. No manual should be a duplicate of the manual in
another community. It should be custom made. In general,
if a contest for the best playground manual was being held,
what would the judges look for? Every department should

185

work out its own criteria, but here are some obvious points.
The manual should:

0 Be attractive in appearance, concise in style, easy to read.
0 Display prominently the name of the department, city,
and state (often omitted).

0 List the major personages, such as mayor, city manager,
recreation commissioner, recreation and/ or park board, et
cetera.

0 Carry a cordial welcome and greeting to the playground
leaders by the head of the department and other officials.

0 List the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
people or departments that the leader might need to call,
including police, fire, hospital, the recreation office, and the
home phone number of anybody who might be needed in an
emergency.

0 contain a statement of the purpose of the manual.

0 Include a table of contents. Pages should be numbered.
0 Provide a chart showing lines of authority and the de-
partment’s organization structure if the department is a
large one.

0 State the department and/ or city policies and regulations.
These include hours, clothing, policing, illness, accidents, use
of car, safety, behavior of leader, behavior of users of public
recreation areas, discipline, liability, et cetera.

0 Include sample forms required of leaders: requisitions,
accident, attendance, registration, reports.

0 Include a playground calendar, showing opening and clos-
ing dates, dates of big events, weekly themes if used, et cetera.
0 Include information about program activities: suggestions
of types suitable for various ages, sex, and degree of skill;
suggestions for special events; personnel schedules for sports
clinics and tournaments, swimming instruction, day camp-
ing, craft programs, and special music and dance activities;
schedules of specialists and any mobile units.

0 Give information about leadership deve10pment: schedule
of staff meetings, use of specialists, dates for inservice train-
ing by workshops and demonstrations, et cetera.

0 Offer suggestions for leadership techniques in various
program areas such as games, crafts, storytelling, music,
drama, dance.

0 Provide sources of special help: where to find rules for
O’Leary, material on nature craft projects, theme parties,
picnic events, storybooks, special supplies like balloons and
records, et cetera.

Above all, the judges would look for evidence of coopera-
tive planning of the manual by the department personnel.
Such planning should be for the main purpose of smoothing
the way of the leader, orienting him, and showing him the
framework in which he will function. As one park and recre-
ation department put it in its statement of purpose, “We hope
this manual serves as a guide to more, effective recrea-
tional leadership rather than a compilation of cutouts and
games.”

ORIENTING NEW LEADERS

ANY NEW LEADER coming into your department f .
' first time, would find it very helpful to:

0 Meet all the other leaders in a big get-together, in
to get a feeling of the department as a whole. An inf.
social occasion will break the ice.

0 Meet those assigned to his area: other leaders, spec
and supervisors.

0 Have some form of department orientation wh
could find out such things as how to get supplies, what
he will work, what to do if it rains, how to report a
dent, how to take attendance, when and how he will g
et cetera.

0 Have some form of preservice training in what
be doing—and on the spot if possible. The new leade
the chance to really play the games, make the crafts,
stories, sing the songs, run the sports clinic, et cete
just hear or read about them.

0 Have regular inservice training in specialized wor
and in staff meetings, where he can talk out his pr
get new ideas, learn new projects, tie in his progr
others, et cetera.

0 Have an up-to-date, adequate department librar
to for new activities and techniques.

0 Have a playground manual that supplements the
face regulations, that includes sample forms he wil
ing, schedules of city-wide events, addresses and a.
numbers he may need, policies he will have to enforc
as no bikes, no dogs, et cetera) . He would like that r
to have some encouraging words on leadership an
ideas about new and interesting program activities.

0 Be allowed and encouraged, if a year-round e
to attend state and district conferences and, when cos
prohibitive, the National Recreation Congress.

0 Be encouraged to continue his professional
through formal and informal recreation education, w
he is employed only for the summer, or is a year-
employe.

If the new leader has been well-trained, he will ha
own game and sport books; know his drama, dan
music material; or be prepared in his craft and natur
ects. He does not need ten pink pages of games, fi
pages of crafts, three yellow pages of music, or on
page of drama. If he is not well-trained, he will nee
more than this. He will need help from people not
In other words, if he is worth hiring, he is worth t
and training in what and how. He will need a pla ;
manual of procedures in order to know what is exp
him, but you should expect and require him to kn
tivities to a reasonable extent, and to know where t
supplement what he knows. The more you eXpect a

ipfest. Coonhound water races are an added attraction and draw big crowds.

or hunting dog lying around that they
would be willing to swap for an equally
old fishing rod, canoe, rowboat, oars,
boxer shorts, camper, or pet coon.

The occasion was “Sportsman’s Bar-
ter Day,” held in Chenoweth Park, near
Jeffersontown, Kentucky, on Saturday.
October 17. Trading was to start at
9:00 AM, but anxious sportsmen, eager
to know if they still possessed their old
touch as “hoss traders” arrived much
earlier. In fact, pocket knives had
changed ownership by 8:15 AM.

Those who had several items were
allowed to spread their displays on park
picnic tables, while those with just one
item could mill around the big “Trad-

in’ Post” and bark their wares. No lim-
its were placed on trading, so several
items swapped hands a number of times.
Owners were allowed to sell as well as
trade their items, so vociferous bar-
gaining was heard throughout the day.
The old-timers boasted of the whopping
trades they had made in the past.
Displays consisted of several antique
guns, pistols, Indian relics, a bushel of
hickory nuts, and fishing equipment.
These were set up to be handled and
looked over by prospective buyers.

SEVERAL Docs were on hand, not only
to be traded or sold, but to partici-
pate in the Coonhound Water Races
put on by the county recreation board
as an added attraction. Even the hounds
enjoyed the sound of an old foxhorn
(a trader’s item) being tested by sev-
eral night hunters, who had courage
enough to try and blow the homemade
horn.

The Coonhound Water Races always
please the crowd. The names of the
dogs were placed in a box and were
drawn out five at a time. The five
names drawn made up the first heat.
Several heats were necessary and were
run off one at a time. The winning dog
of each race was brought back to swim
in the “Championship Race.” Cham-
pion of the 1964 Coonhound Water
Races was a hound by the name of
“Bill,” owned by James Rhodes of
Louisville. A 42-inch trophy was Bill’s
award for his afternoon’s swim. The
dogs swam a distance of 150 yards af-
ter a “coon-scented,” floating cage
pulled across the lake by rope and pul-
ley.

October proved to be ideal for such
an event—at the end of the fishing sea-
son and just prior to the hunting sea-
son. Sportsmen are either putting away
or getting out their equipment and find

that most sportsmen will polish up that

Creative Equipment

TRADITIONAL playground equipment
is being in part supplanted, in part
supplemented, by so-called creative
equipment or by improvised, home-
made apparatus. Creative equipment,
which is more or less abstract in design,
may be used in a variety of ways. Play-
ground executives who have installed
such equipment like it, as the following
letters indicate:

“The newer equipment unquestion-
ably holds the children’s interest and
certainly gives them opportunity for
the invention of ‘games’ both of an
individual and a group nature. This,
in turn, increases the amount of physi-
cal exercise they do, since they play for
a longer period of time.

' Services to the Mentally Retarded
' and Physically Handicapped

'. rized by Morton Thompson, Ed.D.
{1964, the National Recreation Association and the
:— al Association for Retarded Children cooperated in
y of two thousand community recreation depart-
» to determine what services were being provided in the
unity setting for the mentally retarded and physically
apped. It was conducted by Dr. Morton Thompson,
- National Recreation Association, and Arnold Cor-
for the National Association for Retarded Children,
if has been used by Ruth Marson as the basis of a
’s thesis in therapeutic recreation at New York Uni-
.y. A total of 427 indicated that they had some recrea-
program or facilities for either the mentally retarded,
' ally handicapped or both. 0f the 427 communities
. . ned only 202 responses were received in answer to the
questionnaire.

The following breakdowns of the ten. most frequent and
popular activities and facilities for each category—physical-
ly handicapped, mentally retarded, mentally ill, and non-
handicapped—show that these groups are offered almost
identical opportunities. Perhaps more than anything else
they show how similar are the likes and dislikes of the popu-
lation.

Despite the similarity of the above lists and the large
variety of activities and facilities, it must be pointed out
that even the most popular activity, arts and crafts, is avail-
able in slightly over half of the 202 responding communi-

191

ties. It is also significant that the most popular facility,
playground, was available in less than half the communities.

Administration of Programs. In the 202 responding com-
munities, the personnel directly responsible for the ill and
handicapped recreation programs consist of 54 directors, 87
supervisors, 193 leaders, 40 part-time workers, and over
1,100 volunteers.

Transportation. Only thirty-six of the communities provide
any or all of the transportation to and from recreation ac-
tivities and facilities.

Financial Support and Supervision. Financial support of
public recreation programs in these communities comes
from such sources (other than taxes) as: fees and charges,
civic and social clubs, health agencies, private trusts and
grants, and the parents and family of the persons involved.

Program. The recreation program for the ill and handi-
capped is a separately run program in all but twenty-six
communities. In only one community is the program for
the mentally retarded run separately. Eighty-one of the

This survey provides us with a picture of the rec
services provided for the ill and handicapped by co
recreation departments in the United States. The u
is not too encouraging since, out of a group of ov

recreation service was being provided for mentally r
and / or physically handicapped.

Despite the tremendous growth of recreation, new
opments in medical science and increased leisure t'
Americans, there has been a great lag in developing
tion services for the handicapped by community rec
departments. We believe that the next few years wil
a marked increase in this service by communities.

Nature Preserves Commission has approved these areas in
principle. Dedication can be completed as soon as the ne-
cessary legal documents are prepared.

“The Cook County tracts consist of some of the finest
areas within the forest preserves and include a number of
sites of outstanding interest. In the past these tracts have
been deliberately reserved from development and consid-
ered as wild areas. Their dedication as nature preserves
will formalize this status. The areas to be dedicated are
portions of Black Partridge Woods, Busse Forest, Cap Sau-
ers Holding, Cranberry Slough, Jurgenson Woods, Paw-
paw Woods, Salt Creek Woods, Sand Ridge Prairie, Shoe
Factory Road Prairie, Spring Lake Tract, and Sweet
Woods-Zander Woods. Credit is due to Charles C. Sauers
for initiating the dedication of these areas. Mr. Sauers,
who serves as a member of the Illinois Nature Preserves
Commission, retired last May as general superintendent of
the Forest Preserve District. Under his leadership the dis-
trict gained fame for its outstanding accomplishments.”

parks. Revenue from the bonds will be used to add eighty-
eight new rooms in lodges at six state parks, 640 new indi-

are expected to produce about $500,000 in additional an-

cover to be unrollcd. The Yankee field
crew claims the major league mark in
this department, and the weight reduc-
tion offered by the ten-ounce Caprolan
nylon fabric should enable them to im-
prove upon their record.

The new “Yankee Slicker” is the
lightest cover the New Yorkers have
ever had, and its two 90'-by-170’ pieces
can be handled by a single crew of
twelve men. To achieve maximum
speed, however, the Yankees double up
with one crew for each cover.

“The Yankee Slicker” represents the
first time that any kind of major design
has been painted on an athletic field
cover, combining the decorative with
the utilitarian. Painted in light blue
across the dark blue cover is a 120-foot
“New York,” and directly below that
rests a 65-foot-wide version of the fa-
miliar Yankee emblem, the “Yankees”
in script written across a huge base-
ball, capped off with a red, white, and
blue top hat. Bordering the cover, which
is wider than a football field and half
as long, are a twenty-foot pennants of
each team in the American League.

The 30,600-square-foot cover is so
big that it had to be spread out in Con—
vention Hall in Philadelphia in order
to be painted. Fifty gallons of flexible
vinyl paints were used. The combina-
tion of durable nylon and the added
protection of the vinyl coating should
keep the “Yankee Slickcr” in service
for up to five years. Even if the “Slick—
er” is punctured by spiked shoes, the
woven construction of the nylon scrim
fabric eliminates “running” of the tear,
and patching is easy. A solid green
tarpaulin made of a similar fabric,
combining Caprolan nylon and vinyl,
was installed earlier last season to pro-
tect the infield in Shea Stadium, home

of the New York Mets ball club.

Slickcr is impressive:

PEST CONTROL produces some real
pain-in-the-neck problems for sani-
tation and maintenance men. The Rec-
reation and Parks Department in Rich-
mond, California, found this out when
cockroaches invaded its public swim-
ming facility. It came as quite a sur-
prise because this was the first time the
department had experience of serious
pest problem since the much-used pool
opened in 1927. Rarely does the cock-
roach gain a foothold in this type of
facility, especially when, as in this case,
extra effort was made to keep it clean.
While general maintenance and preven-
tive spraying had controlled nuisance
pests such as ants and fleas, it proved to
be a weak weapon against the highly
reproductive and hardy cockroach.

For help, city officials turned to sci-
entists in the Ortho Division of the

phasizing their need for a material that
would kill the cockroaches but would
not leave a residue of any kind that
would possibly present a hazard later
on when the pool was back in use. Cal-

leader is not given an opportunity to
contribute to the program or to be-
come acquainted with the broad areas
of recreation, and he is seldom includ-
ed in the planning and reporting stages.
Consequently, his summer position be-
comes a routine bore and does not
awaken his enthusiasm or interest.

Include the junior volunteer in your
thinking and summer playground plan-
ning. Call upon him for suggestions
whenever possible and never allow him
to believe he is being used to foster the
program without proper recognition,
if such recognition is deserved.

The recreation professional must
reach into the school curriculum for an
opportunity to present the educational
side of recreation. In Long Beach, New
York, the recreation director, Yale Neu-
mann, has accomplished this. The need
is there but it never really has been
dealt with professionally. '

The interested recreation college
freshman usually comes from a back-
ground of athletics and has some know-
ledge of playgrounds from his own com-
munity. Would it not be a positive ap-
proach to expose him to the philos0phy
and administrative attitudes and meth-
ods of the profession? The recreation
superintendent is best trained for this
task. It should not be part of a physi-
cal-education department’s responsibil-
ity. The offering of a noncredit course
with a project to interest high-school
students would have carry-over value
throughout the total community more
ation program. A major part of it
should be in laboratory experience
with an emphasis on reporting and
planning. This approach works very
successfully in industry with their co-
operative programs and most definitely
in other professions.

Now is the time to take the emphasis
of projecting recreation and placing it
where it belongs—in the hands of the
recreation professional, not the physi-
cal-education specialist.#

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

\‘"

Expansion of National Parks

PRIORITIES for expansion of the Na-
tional Park System were the sub-
ject of a paper by Joe Penfold, chair-
man of the Citizens Committee for the
Outdoor Recreation Resources Review
Commission Report, presented to the
eleventh annual conference on national
conservation hosted by the National
Wildlife Federation in December. Mr.
Penfold urges conservationists to es-
tablish realistic priorities for NPS leg-
islation. He points out that amounts
available under the Land and Water
Conservation Fund will not cover costs
of acquiring lands in all areas author-
ized or likely to be proposed during the
next few years. He suggests that prior-
ity for use of fund bill monies for Na-
tional Park System areas be given to
speeding acquisition in authorized areas
(Point Reyes, Padre Island, and so on),
and to those new areas “most immedi-
ately threatened with destruction, and

which would contribute maximum

values . . . .”

Mr. Penfold notes also that there are
practical limitations on the number of
new area proposals which the Interior
committees can process. He suggests,
again, that priority go to those threat-
ened with destruction, ahead of areas
proposed for the National Park Sys-
tem areas which are already in federal
ownership.

AYH “Outdoor Bound”

THOUSANDS of young Americans take

Hostels stands ready to give service to
the “outdoor bound”! AYH is cele-
brating its 30th Anniversary Year in
1965 by extending this service. The
theme of the year is “Hosteling for
More Americans.”

The AYH headquarters is in the N a-
tional Recreation Association head-
quarters building in New York City,
and early on a Friday afternoon, the
sidewalks outside these offices swarm
with young people departing on all sorts
of AYH trips. Their eager young faces

vard, Massachusetts, greet their young guests, members of Tewksbury Hostel i

ples from person to person are an al-
most irresistible invitation to join them
on their weekend adventuring in the
country.

May, which is National Bike Month,
offers an excellent opportunity for rec-
reation leaders to explore hosteling as
an outdoor activity which can enrich
their own programs. Who can resist
sampling the countryside in spring?
Hostelers not only bike, but they hike,
canoe, ride horseback.

Membership in AYH has doubled in
the past five years, but, in relation to
the need of American youth for hostel-
ing activities and exercise, the organ-
ization feels that there is still a tremen-
dous task ahead in introducing them to
larger numbers of young people. So far,
hosteling is more widely enjoyed in
Europe than in the U. S. One of the
main AYH objectives in ’65 is to work
more closely with recreation leaders in
starting hosteling in their areas; an-
other is to provide more hostel accom-
modations in large cities, thus enabling
hostelers to travel across our country
as they do across the varied lands of
Europe.

One of the finest contributions to the
development of hosteling in America is
the new hosteling-cycling film, A Road
to Adventure, which had its premiere

only a few months ago. Each AYI.

and a dime-store sponge-rubber ball in-
stead of a softball. The modified game
can be played by younger children, by
boys and girls, and yet teach some of
the fundamental skills of softball.

Other examples (two of the few
games for primary children) are adap-
tations of “Farmer in the Dell” and
“Looby LOO.” For the Christmas sea-
son, they become “Santa’s in the Shop,”
et cetera and “This Is the Way We Trim

A collection like this one, relying as
it does too heavily 011 balls and the

ing the ways by which a game can be
made to fit a specific age, or playing

published to be sold at so reasonable
a price is amazing. A perfect gift book
for the nature lover, conservationist,
armchair traveler, or visitor to our na-
tion’s parks.

Imaginative Techniques in Painting,
Leonard Richmond. Reinhold Publish-
ing Corporation, 430 Park Avenue,
New York 10022. Pp. 121, illustrated.
$10.95.

WRITTEN by a well-known English
artist and writer, this book is a
high-priced oneh-in the"‘gift class.”
The author teaches by demonstration
to help painters and amateurs to develop
their own imagination in painting. He
shows many examples of work but offers
no set rules so that he “stimulates the
mind to personal interpretation in order
to convey the definite character of the
artist’s creative impulse.”

All media are covered. Most of the
drawings and paintings are black and
white with some beautifully colored
ones. The chapter on “Unusual Water
Color Techniques” is noteworthy, in-
deed—Mary B. Cummings, Recreation
Specialist, National Recreation A ssocia-
tion Consulting Service on Recreation

Design in Photography, 0. R. Croy.
Hasting House, 151 East 50th Street,
New York 10022. Pp. 174, illustrated.
$8.95.

AVE YOU EVER seen an “optical
breakdown” of a lily or a pattern
produced by “kaleidoscopic multiplica-
tion” of a geranium? Dr. Croy intro-
duces us to both. Actually, you would
have to be either a photographer or a
designer, or a combination of both, to
truly evaluate this book, but for anyone
in search of ideas for design or for pho-
tography, it is a must. To the uniniti-
ated it will be fascinating. The book is
full of beautiful photographs for it is
one of the “Communication Visual
Book Series” put out by Hastings
House. It shows, among many things,
how a halftone can be reduced to mere
lines or partial shadows or into dra-
matic effects of pure blacks and whites.
More complicated techniques for the
expert photographer venture into su-
perimposition and combination of posi-
tives and negatives, masking, tone sep-
aration. and so on. Anyone interested
in the above topics will be thrilled with
this new publication, and artists will
find it an inspiration. They will want
it on their reference shelves.

Dr. Croy, a doctor of natural science.
is Austrian, and the first of his well-
known books on photo tricks was pub-

205

lished in 1938. On his sixtieth birthday
recently, the President of the Austrian
Republic awarded him the title of Pro-
fessor.

IN BRIEF

EXPLORING WITH PAINT, Henry Petter-
son and Ray Gerring. Reinhold Pub-
lishing, 430 Park Avenue, New York
10022. Pp. 68, illustrated. $5.50. Here
is an especially good book for teachers,
recreation leaders and anyone working
in art with children or adults because
it shows how the leader can motivate
an individual to free his imagination to
do creative work and explore original
ways of using all manners of “tools”:
cardboard, foam rubber or sponge roll-
ers, oil painting knives, kitchen spa-
tulas, eye droppers, sticks, his fingers,
tissue paper, crinoline, cheesecloth,
wax, brushes, and crayons. A chapter
on “Setting the Mood” is eSpecially in-
formative for a teacher of creative
painting and will start many others on
paths to creative expression. Tech-

niques of motivation are carefully de-
scribed.

THE CITY AND THE ARTS, August Heck-
scher. Institute of Local Government,
University of Pittsburgh. Pp. 16. Paper,
$1.50. Mr. Heckscher’s main concern

in this publication is for the top-level
artist and organization and what can
be done to enrich community life by
bringing them together with local gov-
ernment in a close working relation-
ship. His attitude toward arts councils

and other forms of cooperative arrange-
ments between public and private
bodies is favorable. Several important
examples are cited in The City and the
Arts. The role of educational, recrea-
tional, and other community services
affecting the arts is practically ignored.
He puts the solution of the problem in
the hands of the select few. City hall
which deals with the public at large and
the public welfare will probably want a
solution based on the interdependence
of all forces affecting the cultural life
of the city at all levels including recrea-
tion and education.—S. F.

PRINTS AND How TO MAKE THEM, Ar-
thur Zaidenberg. Harper and Row, 49
East 33rd Street, New Y orh 10016. Pp.

berg has written many fine books on art
