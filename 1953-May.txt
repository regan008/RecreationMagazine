RECREATION

0 Variety itself
cannot savor our
lives. The spice of
life lies rather in
the discovery of

 

the talents, apti-
tudes and interests that lie deep within
us and in the exercise of those qualities.
We are fortunate if our daily work hap-
pens to give us the satisfaction that
comes from being ourselves to the full-
est. Then without further enrichment
we are in a state of continuous growth
of mind and spirit—each day we are
recreated to a higher plane. But in the
narrowly specialized urban industrial
life of today one’s job is seldom so ful-
filling. For most of us something more
is needed to make life complete. We
need additional opportunity to sound
and express the potentialities that are
within us, and in that process get the
thrill of growth that tells us we are liv-
ing. That is recreation.

There is one essential to recreation.
It must be free—-not strained—but
spontaneous. In that sense it must bc
lcisurely, that is, the person, not the
clock, must be leisurely. Recreation
cannot be simply a time filler, a spare-
time function. In fact, the time used
in recreation may bc the wisest use of
that time. On occasion recreation is
cven a more important use of time
than is eating, sleeping, or working.

Recreation is conducive to mental

health when it is genuine. Its spon-
taneous quality is the best insurance of
its genuineness and of its integrative
value. This spontaneous recreation is
quite different from recreation which is
prescribed as a cure. To the shrunken
soul, recreation may in truth be thera-
peutic, even though its spirit is gener-
ally more positive—-—to make the strong
stronger.

It is something of a travesty on rec-
reation to call it “recreation thcrapy”
and thereby try to crown it as a justifi-
cation which obscures its inherent posi-
tive virtues. 'But too often recreation
in our clinics and mental hospitals is
hard to sell to those who hold the purse
strings without tagging the word “ther-
apy” to it. This is because recreation is
not otherwise seen as a basic need of
life, but rather as a frivolity.

There are those who give recrcation
a lower value than other aspects of
living and think of play as one of those
unessential, even if pleasant, things
identified with the irresponsibility of
childhood. Not infrequently our school
boards fail to authorize the facilities
and personnel that are needed to give
the child an opportunity to play, to be-
come familiar with his inherent talents
and aptitudes. They prefer to fill him
with the content of our ready-made cul-
ture, and fail to strengthen his poten-
tial for adding to it. An unbalanced
life and even mental ill health can come
from carrying such a viewpoint into ac-
tion. For those who have suppressed
the ability to play, a designed recrea-
tional prescription may be required be-
fore spontaneity can have its day. But

Editorial

I

prevention of such a status is to be
preferred to its correction.

To speak of recreation as therapy
is unfortunate for two reasons. On the
onc hand to tag recreation indiscrimi-
nately as therapy excludes its intrinsic
value to which no added justification is
needed. On the other hand, calling it
thcrapy may be misleading. It may cre-
ate a confident belief that a scientific-
ally justified therapy has been worked
out which permits recreation to be pre-
scribed, as are true ‘therapies. Speci-
fically in relation to illness the scienti-
fically tested therapeutic use of recrea-
tion still awaits research.

As with food, recreation is good for
everyone, sick or,well, but it may be
therapeutic when a dcficiency is found
that calls for its specific use. There is
much still to be learned about the thera-
peutic application of recreation, but to
advance our knowledge we must be
clear that as yet we are grossly ignor-
ant of its therapeutic potential. For
the healthy pcrson it is well to remem-
ber that play along with eating and
sleeping is a foundation of growth of
the mammal—turbulent and reckless in
the young—integrated into the econ-
omy of life as maturity is reached. Play
is thus a part of thc healthy develop-
ment of behavior and mental health.

Recreation is, therefore, an essential
part of the interest of the National As-
sociation for Mental Health in preserv-
ing mental health. It is appropriate to
include it in the observance of National
Mental Health Week which the National
Association for Mental Health is spon-
soring the week of May 3-9.

Recruitment of Students

Sirs:

I listened with attention tO Charles
Brightbill’s presentation Of ideas con-
cerning screening Of new students for
recreation at the National Recreation
Association Congress in Seattle, care-
fully read his recent article, “Under-
graduate Training,” in the December
1952 issue of RECREATION, and feel
that I should take this Opportunity to
express a different point Of view con-
cerning this problem. I believe no stu-
dent should be refused admittance to
the recreation curriculum. I believe I
am not alone in this point Of view and
it represents a totally different ap-
proach to the problem of selection of
students for professional preparation
in recreation than he has expressed.

I contend that we have no testing
instruments either Objective or subjec-
tive that can predict the future of im-
mature pe0p1e with any degree Of reli-
ability. I believe the people who have
devised and are working with the Oh-
jective tests we use would be the first
to say they are not infallible. One only
needs to read of the accounts where IQ
scores have been raised or lowered sev-
eral points by such things as emotion.
eyesight, hearing, exhaustion, language
difficulties, general academic back-
ground, and the like, to realize that
even with the advances we have made
in testing, they are far from perfect. If
a test is not perfect, have we the right
to interpret this questionable result as
a basis for refusing admittance to the
curriculum?

To hase a judgment concerning the
future of an individual upon any sub-
jective methods such as personal ref-
erences, interviews, and so on, is even
more unreliable and subject to the
foibles of man than the tests he de-
vises. Humans are so complex wc won-
der if we ever know them and to base
any judgments on an interview, even
when you have the person’s recorded
background, seems to me to be totally
undemocratic as well as subject to the
limitations of the interviewer who is a
human.

I do not wish to leave the impression
that we should not use these objective
and subjective devices hut I do not
think they should be used to admit or
reject students from entering the rec-
reation curriculum. Quite to the con-

trary, I would like to see these tests, as
well as others devised and the old ones
remodeled, used to help the student
gain insight to his or her strengths and
weaknesses.

I believe we should admit all students
to the recreation curriculum, in fact
urge as many as possible to enter, and
hold our standards within the curricu-
lum to such heights as to assure those
who complete the course that they have
grown and developed to a point where
they are capable of making a worthy
contribution to recreation in some ca-
pacity.

This idea Of allowing any to enter
is entirely consistent with our demo-
cratic principles and with a basic phi-
losophy in our country of providing
equal opportunity for all. It is further
consistent with the basic tenet that ed-
ucation is a process of change. We
must accept the challenge and devise
methods Of effecting change in these
students so that we will have a gradu-
ate who can and will make a contribu-
tion to recreation.

DR. WILLIAM J. TAIT, Director of
Recreation Curriculum, Florida State
University.

} Mr. Brightbill’s reply to the’ above

letter follows.

Sirs:

I was delighted to hear Dr. Tait’s
thinking on the business of selecting
students to undertake training in recre-
ation and I subscribe to the principal
thesis he expounds.

To be sure, any process which arbi-
trarily excludes candidates from an Op-
portunity to pursue the kind of educa-
tion they earnestly seek is highly ques-
tionable. On the other hand, there is
nothing undemocratic in trying to get
the round pegs in round holes. Cer-
tainly, mistakes will be made, but then
all life is made up of calculated risks
and an orderly plan Of selecting stu-
ents—based 011 common sense and
good judgmentwis not an exception.
If the resources with which to provide
training were without end, your case
would he airtight. But this is not so.

Without prolonging the discussion, I
rather suspect that, as usual, the proper
solution lies somewhere in between
“selection” and the “Open door” policy.

A Once Genial Art

311's:

Thc Roving Editor inadvertently let
a cat out of the bag in his report in
American Squares (February, 1953);

No more pointed index has bcen
given us of the sad state to which
square dancing has degenerated than
his admonition on programming: “And

don’t forget the mixers and fun
dances.” When callers have to be re-
minded to include mixers and fun

dances in their programs, what has
happened to the jolly fellowship once
inherent in the square dance?

The irony is even more dismal when
we consider that the admonition refers
to only part of the program being set
aside for fun dances. Surely, all square
dances should be fun dances.

The grim seriousness with which
many square dancers of today take
their “fun” is a melancholy reflection
on the dying of a once genial folk art.

There is no mystery in the appalling
death rate of square dance clubs in
certain western areas. Let us, however,
not mourn their passing. Rather, let us
resurrect the old-fashioned fun and fel-
lowship that had been buried by them.

Sidelight

} An interesting little sidelight 'on
Lummi Sticks (See Letters, March 1953
issue): Mildred Scanlon of the NRA
leadership training staff has just noti-
lied us that Mr. Hans Thompson, whose
letter appeared in last month’s maga-
zine, is the person who taught her to
play Lummi Sticks—at the Northwest
District Conference at Moscow, Idaho,
two years ago.-——Ed.

Bread Upon the \Vaters
Sirs:

Three years ago we were approached
hy a group of men interested in Barber
Shop Singing, asking if we would con-
sider sponsoring a local chapter of the
S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. as an adult activity in
the recreation program. A place was
needed for singing and holding a week-
ly meeting, with kitchen facilities and
an Opportunity for the group to break
up into quartets—using various rooms
in the building for practice. In no way
were we to he financially responsible
for them. They would, through their
own organization, administer the func-
tions and the finances of the group.

It has been three years since thc
friendly arrangement has been made
hetween the two organizations and the
BarbershOppers have been very coop-
erative. In this short span of time.
they have brought credit to themselves
and to the community. There haye been
many appearances of their chorus and
quartets to help groups in the com-
munity and other nearby towns to raise
money for very worthy causes. This
has been done with no remuneration
whatsoever to the singers themselves.

Last year a Parade of Quartets was

held here by the local chapter. The

‘ Buffalo Bills, 1950 world champs, and

the Aherjona Moaners, sectional
champs from Reading, Massachusetts,
were guest quartets. The group de-
cided that all funds above operating ex-
penses would go toward youth recrea-
tion. Recently, the Presque Isle Com-
munity Association was presented with
a portahle PA system costing between

$500 and $600, and a check for
$100.04—with which to purchase a
new table tennis tahle and a screen for
the movie projector.

This is a practical interpretation of
the old saying, “Bread cast upon the
waters shall return seven-fold.” You
see, when we said “yes,” it was with no
strings attached; we asked nothing and
expected nothing from them. You can
understand our appreciation for what
this. group has done.

ship”—according to Horace M. Al-
bright who is president of Resources
for the Future, a non-profit corpora-
tion, devoted to the support of re-
search and education in the field of re-
source conservation and development.
A group of- national leaders, invited
to form a Council of Sponsors, held a
preliminary meeting in Washington,
April 20, 21 and 22 at the invitation
of President Eisenhower. 'Mr. Otto T.
Mallory, chairman of the National
Recreation Association board, is a
member of the council.

) PHYSICAL EXERCISE IS AN AGE-INHIB-
ITING FACTOR important in forestalling
the effects of old age, according to Dr.
Ernst Jokl, a leading European heart
specialist, who has just arrived in this
country. Dr. J okl has studied the phy-
siology of athletes for many ~years.
Via the New York Times, he explains
that by “exercise” he means some ac-
tive sport in which the participant can
joyously indulge.

FICE OF EDUCATION is the result of
forty-five staff members having been
released, and twenty-eight positions
abolished. The 83rd Congress chose
to exercise its economy drive on this

office and the programs under its di-
rection.

) A FIFTEEN-CENT PARKING FEE IN-
CREASE at seventy-eight sites in New
York State parks has been passed, in
line with a recommendation from
Governor Dewey, by the State Coun-
cil of Parks. It will go into effect
May 23rd. The new tariff will mean a
total parking fee of fifty cents, which
will be slated for the state treasury.
Other park tariffs will remain the

same, according to Robert Moses,
chairman of the council.

) THE STATE RECREATION COUNCIL of
Pennsylvania, created by Governor
Fine in 1952 as an agency advisory to
the governor, is recommending to that
executive and to the general assembly
the establishment of an independent
administrative commission to be
known as the Pennsylvania Recreation
Commission. Governor Fine’s budget
message to the general assembly, upon
creation of the council, recommended
an appropriation of $150,000 for the
council’s use during the 1953-55 bi-

ennium.

ed the honorary chairmanship of the
United Defense Fund, which will seek
$20,225,000 through Community
Chests and other united community
campaigns this year for support of the
defense-related programs of its six
member agencies.

“If there’s an armistice in Korea,
don’t let anyone tell you the need will
be lessened for services that the UDF
agencies are providing,” the President
told volunteer representatives of the
United Defense Fund and its member
agencies at the annual meeting of

UDF in Washington, D. C., in April.

Training

} An unusual Southern District Con-
ference, which may be a straw to show

which way the wind is blowing, is an-
nounced by the National Recreation
Association, for May 10-11. Its topic,
“Recreation in Correctional Institu-
tions,” has aroused much interest
among prison leaders.

) Two weeks of leadership training
for volunteer workers in the Savannah
River area of South Carolina, begin-
ning May 18, will be conducted by
Miss Mildred Scanlon of the NRA
leadership training staff. Training will
be focused on volunteers to provide
leadership primarily for young chil-
dren in trailer communities where in-
door recreation facilities are practical-
ly non-existent. This is a special proj-
ect of the Association’s Defense De-
partment.

74 RECREATION

“The vieWpoint expressed here is important in the evolution of
recreation into areas of guidance and treatment.”—-J. E. Davis

RECREATION IS More

National Mental Health Week, May 3-9, 1953

WHILE EVERYONE AGREES that recreation is fun, few re-
alize that the pleasurable character accepted as char-

acteristic of this natural phenomenon has limited our un-
derstanding of one of the most important facets of living.
The vastly increasing use of play as a method of treatment
and in child education is bringing to light both facts and
fallacies which pertain to the sick and the well, and is en-
ahling us to gain insight for a more practical application of
recreation to everyday problems of behavior.

The added premise that funful activity is necessarily
wholesome recreation is not borne out by the facts. One
should realize that there are all kinds of play and many
conflicting and confusing ideas about recreation. Whether
we become physically strong or are enabled to get along
better with others through recreational experience depends
manifestly upon the character of recreation employed, the
purpose set forth, and the methods used.

Here is a child who is naturally self-centered. He is
skillful in softball. Because of his superior skill, he is able
to dominate the play situation and build up undesirable
characteristics; he uses recreation to build up his overly
egocentric traits. Another child is withdrawn; if left to his
own devices, he may select a solitary activity such as a
puzzle through which he can consort with himself to the
exclusion of other children. The submissive child may
naturally drift into a play situation in which he will be able
to gain satisfaction in seeing others assume full responsi-
bility. The overly exhibitionistic child may utilize the game
as the ideal place to show off, while at the same time gain-
ing satisfaction from upsetting the activity. The resentful
child may seek in the play experience the place and time
to vent his displeasure, building it up instead of relieving
it. The indifferent child may be able to discover, in a spe-
cific play situation, an area in which his desires for irre-

THAN FUN

sponsible behavior are satisfied. A child feigning disabil-
ity may use a selective type of play as an ideal background
for his pretenses. These are some of the asocial uses to
which play and recreation can be applied.

One of the most widely accepted misconceptions of recre-
ation is that we play primarily to win. Play is a far too
important experience in living to be limited to such a nar-
row goal. One has only to observe children in the natural
spontaneous atmOSphere of a game to appreciate the many
other factors that enter into this experience. The child
plays for the purpose of exploring, of testing himself in a
softened environment, or acting, reacting and interacting
in various individual and group situations. While influ-
enced by the competitions which crop up in these experi-
ences, he is likely to find greater satisfaction in the facets
of comraderie rather than competition. This can be shown
by asking the young child to choose sides. He will select
his friends rather than the best players; and this is cqually
true in dealing with certain adult groups of the mentally
sick. While it is true that the feeling for excelling is strong
in the child, it is the belief of many educators that this
strong motivation in children has been overstressed and
over developed for the simple reason that children can be
led so easily in this direction.

Recreational therapists working with the mentally ill
are constantly exposed to the unfavorable reactions of
patients who are intent upon winning as an exclusive aim.
A quiet and well behaved mental patient was being in-
ducted into a baseball game as part of hospital treatment.
Having played this game in his youth and having an un-
usually good background of skill, he was able to play a
very good game. His team was going down to defeat in a
closely contested engagement when he became acutely dis-
turbed and began shouting: “We are losing this game, I
am a wash-out.” His conduct became so threatening that
he had to retire from the game. Such incidents stress the
need for the organization of play as both a cooperative and

75

competitive experience with winning as but one of the
goals. Winning should motivate but not direct the activity.
Few parents realize the importance of playing with their
children. Some parents feel they have taken care of their
responsibility by simply providing play paraphernalia and
a place in which to engage in activity. The discerning
father who plays with his young child aids him in simple
motor coordinations but, more important, projects the child
into a richly rewarding inter-personal relationship. The
child senses a close and warm comradeship and protection.
He begins to experience the satisfaction of playing along
with his father rather than against him. A saving sense of
good will mollifies the hard knocks and shocks of the awk-
ward child exploring various activities. An atmosphere of
confidence is engendered. Failures in simple play tech-
niques are overshadowed by the increasing series of suc-
cesses. There is a thrill in meeting the big world in terms
of new values based upon abilities and interests, in an at-
mosphere which is both permissive and understanding.

The child feels that the father accepts him and likes him
because he plays with him and naturally begins to attach
himself more closely to his parent. While improvement in
learning simple rules and ways of playing naturally takes
place, this is not the life of the experience. The life of the
experience is the richly developing inter-personal relation—
ship as the child realizes he can do things, is gradually
gaining control of his body and is getting to be a “big boy”
who can be a “nice boy” at the same time. Since this play
experience is pleasurable, he shows willingness to give as
well as take in his relations with other children and parents
alike. Later on, as he advances into team situations, he be-
gins to realize the personal satisfaction of sharing.

Simple sensory expression constitutes the child’s early
play. As he grows in physical strength and emotional sta-
bility, he begins to ask more questions and get ideas about
this most natural physical expression. He makes gestures
and engages in symbolic representation. A world of real-
ity and fantasy begin to grow side by side. In play the
young child does not have to make too close a differentia-
tion between them, and for that reason is able to engage in
mental as well as physical play leading to excursions into
fantasy. This is a crucial stage of child development and
the parent who desires to play intelligently with his child
should be appreciative of the unique educational and emo-
tional, as well as physical, factors involved. Despert re-
minds us_ that “play begins very early and, at first, the
motor component is largely predominant. With the devel-
opment of speech as an expressive medium, motor activity
becomes relatively less important.”

As the motor component assumes less importance, the
associations which surround the experience become increas-
ingly powerful in affecting growth and behavior. Words
begin to be attached to play acts and the total experience
becomes more complex. As the child grows into adulthood,
these associations become organized into various patterns
and become, in the words of the psychologist, structural-
ized. While other experiences become essential units of this

76

growing personality structure, play assumes the major role
in the growth and education of the young child.

The child needs the stability and support of love and
affection, from parents or parent substitutes, a proper me-
dium for growth to maturity without overprotection, care
that he is not being pushed too fast towards adulthood,
healthy socializing experiences with children of similar ages
and interests, people with whom he can identify in con-
structive relationships, selective play paraphernalia, and
adequate and proper outlets for his energies. Recreational
activities should fit into this general framework and be
modified to meet these various requirements for normal de-
velopment and growth. It can readily be seen that play
adapted for these specific purposes is far more than fun.
It becomes an integral part of life and is not limited to

 

phenomena which simply cater to the child’s whims and
fancies, it ministers to his actual needs.

The teacher is becoming acquainted with these hygienic
aims, and parents generally are becoming more conscious
of the need to understand these many significant factors,
both direct and indirect, in the environment. These broad
principles provide a helpful basis for those who are desir-
ous of understanding their children and utilizing this im-
portant information in early adjustment for the purpose
of getting the individual started in constructive habits of
living.

The teacher learns much about the child by simply ob-
serving his actions in a play experience in which he reveals
his true self through the spontaneous movements. The
therapist, also, can obtain most valuable clues to a patient’s
social reactions, whether he is social (with the group),
anti-social (against the group), or unsocial (not conscious
of the group relationship). Through recreation, one finds
an ideal medium for understanding the child and creating
emotional satisfactions. This information is basic to the
education of the child in its attitudes toward life. As Doctor
Will Menninger states: “Although most professional people
make their living by the use of intelligence, which may or
may not be supplemented by the toil of their hands and the
sweat of their brows, everyone makes his life through his
emotions—through loves and hates, faith and hope, jubila-
tions and disappointments. They are the vital part of life.
We continually react emotionally to the people and things
about us. Life is a flowing stream of opportunities, chal-
lenges and problems which demand that, insofar as our ca-
pacity and our emotional response permit, we adjust and
readjust to them. When an individual has emotional or

RECREATION

Intellectual or physical limitations, the adjustment is more
difficult. The difficulty is greatly increased when those
about him lack an understanding of his situation.”

Thcre is probably no finer situation, where the parent or
teacher can observe the emotional difficulties of the child,
than in the natural play experience. Here the child is him-
self, he is speaking the language he can understand, the
language of activity. Play, therefore, is being used as a
testing technique by psychologists and is affording the edu-
cator a more complete understanding of the child. Sergeant
says that the child who has been taught to rcply dutifully
that he loves his mother, gives that answer to a direct ques-
tion; yet in drawing or the manipulation of play materials,
he will consistently destroy the mother figure. It should be
realized that the child does not play simply to amuse him-
self but to reveal his own self and communicate with others
in his environment.

The value of recreation and play in the correction of
early behavior reactions, which if neglected may lead to
unhappy and frustrated personalities in adult life, is one
of the most important areas of child education. The recre-
ational director of a mental hospital was privileged to in-
terview large numbers of patients relative to their early
play history. Many of the patients told of the difficulties en-
countered in adjusting to sport activities, in some cases
owing to the lack of skill but more so to the confusion as to
the actual aims of the games and the complex inter-per-
sonal situations which aroused their fears, doubts and sus-
picions. One of the patients stated that he was inducted
into a circle game in which patients, one at a time, went
into the center of the circle. The idea was to avoid being
hit by a soft ball being thrown by the players in the circle.
The patient complained bitterly that he was awkward, was
hit almost immediately and was relegated to the fringe of
the circle. He explained significantly: “And I have been on
the fringe of the circle ever since.” While there were prob-
ably other factors accounting for his mental breakdown,
this early impression undoubtedly contributed to his fail-
ure to get along with his fellows. There is need for a care-
ful plan for play, if wholesome and happy adjustment to
rcality is to replace such harmful effects.

It should be understood that play is a feeling as well as
a doing process, and that the way the child feels toward
the activity may well determine its value in assisting him
to meet the world of people and things. The child seeks,

 

MAY 1953

 

first, emotional satisfaction and will manipulate toys in
almost every conceivable manner to satisfy his emotional
needs. He will explore various ways of playing and then
gradually develop the associations which influence him to
accept or reject social practices. Play is not primarily an
intellectual process to the child; he is not impressed with
the formal patterns of playing, and only though repeated
instruction is he able to accept the rules of the game.

In accepting these, the child undergoes a transition from
an exploring stage to the higher levels of socialization and
it is here that the teacher has an ideal medium for instruc-
tion in mental hygiene. The child should not be required
to give up all of his individuality in becoming a member
of the team, but should be led to understand that he has
unique abilities and can contribute his special gift to the
team effort. Smart coaches sense this situation when they
rotate players until each individual is placed where he can
perform to the maximum for the team. This balancing of
individual desires and team requirements is a delicate mat-
ter providing challenge to the educator to develop a new
perspective of play in which winning is not the whole ob-
jective.

Probably the most comprehensive concept of recreation
is that it is simply a slice of life, a way of living which
changes as people become older. Children find in physical
exercise an acceptable way of meeting the world. J. C. Sol-
omon informs us: “It [play] is an effective means by
which the child approaches the world of reality. By deal-
ing with things which are small or inanimate he can master
situations which to him are overwhelming. He thereby
minimizes in retrospect the omnipotence of the environment
and prepares for the future, thus increasing the powers of
his own ego.” Since recreation is simply another way of
living, it is of course susceptible to all the adjustments and
changes which accompany life itself. Adolf Meyer spoke
of play as an experience and in his writings strcssed the
totality of play as a part of the experience of living. Par-
ents, leaders and therapists alike are discovering in the play
phenomenon a natural way of living for the child, in which
they are able to direct him into successively higher adapta-
tions through growth and understanding. It should be re-
alized that children experience a skill hunger, and the par-
ent can develop this skill through properly selected recrea-
tion and progress the degree of the skill adaptation asuthe
child grows. Psychiatrists and psychologists detect a rela-

“tionship between this growing control of the body and the

control of mental traits in the direction of wholesome phy-
sical and mental integration.

_, Play and recreation are undoubtedly the.most important
avenues of the parent for the education and development
of- the child. Current medical practice is also givingin-
creasing prestige to the concept of motivated activity pre-
scribed medically as an integral part of treatment. Specific
modifications of such activities are being employed for a
Wide variety of pathological conditions—schizophrenia,
paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, hemiplegia,
poliomyelitis are but a few major categories.

77

To get the most out of recreation in terms of physical
and mental health, the following guides are suggested:

1. Play should above all be natural, allowing the indi-
vidual to express his own personality.

2. Play should be free and expressive.

3. Play should be modifiable, its many forms and grada-
tions providing activity suited to the interest and capacity
of the individual.

4. Play should be both competitive and cooperative.
awakening the aggressive traits while at the same time
providing for the development of team effort. I
_ 5. Play should be sublimative, giving outlet to blocked
impulses, urges or desires.

6. Play should be interpretative, allowing the individual
to unfold his nature and show his attitude toward himself,
his environment and life generally.

7. Play should be progressive, enabling the individual to ,

attain higher steps of social and physical advancement.

8. Play should be integrative, enabling the individual to
focus his attention and organize his motor and mental field
into a constructive pattern.

9. Play should be inherently satisfying, attracting the
individual into pleasurable and constructive.activity.

My philosophical concept, as I recently stated elsewhere,
is given: Fundamentally, recreation to attain the status of
therapy must be a creative process. It must in some way
develop a zestful spirit which will motivate the human sys-
tem into activity. It must attain the full significance of re-

creation, bringing new ideas, and stimulating mental an
physical processes into action. It must be, by its ver
character, an outgoing process in which pleasurable excit<
ment draws the ego out and makes it aware of the instin<
tual forces in the subconscious. The concept of recreatio
must stem from an appreciation of its origin as a psych:
therapeutic force rather than an activity and it must be u!
derstood that physical exercise is but the secondary man
festation of an inherent pleasurable urge to action. To fin
its highest therapeutic usefulness, recreation must be at
corded a synthetic role in which process rather than cons:
quence is stressed and the rich symbolism so natural]
awakened is given expression.* Such a viewpoint as th:'
brings recreation into new-relationships in which new va
ues and new aims carry the teacher away from the ideas (
play as a means of simply accelerating normal growth c
as a purely funful phenomenon.

Eduard C. Lindeman

 

1885-1953

Dr. Eduard Christian Lindeman, one of the foremost leaders in the fields of soci:
work and adult education, died on April 13 in New York City, after an illness. H
was sixty-seven years old.

Born of Danish immigrant parents in St. Clair, Michigan, and orphaned as a ver
young child, Eduard Lindeman worked as a laborer and farm hand until he we
twenty-one, when he was finally able to begin his formal education.

In 1911, at the age of twenty-six, he received his Bachelor of Science degree frm
the Michigan Agricultural College. This was followed by an honorary Master (
Humanics from Springfield College in 1937 and a Doctor of Laws degree fr01
Wagner Memorial Lutheran College in 1942.

Upon completion of his undergraduate school work, be edited an agricultural jou:
nal and then taught at several colleges and universities. In 1924, he joined the sta
of the New York School of Social Work at Columbia University, with which be we

affiliated until his retirement in 1950.

During his outstanding career. in social welfare and as a leader in the adult educz
tion movement, Dr. Lindeman held many official and civic positions including that of director of the Department (
Community Organization for Leisure uncler the Works Progress Administration, executive committee member of th
Adult Education Association, member of the advisory committee of the White House Conference on Children in D1
Inocracy, chairman of the board of trustees of the National Child Lahor Committee, the International Community Cente.
and the National Urban League. At the time of his death, he was president of the National Council of Social Work.

Dr. Lindeman was a prolific writer—as a contributing editor of the New Republic magazine, with which he wa

associated for twenty years, and the author of many books, among them: The Community, 1921; Social Discovery, 1924
The Meaning of Adult Education, 1926; Urban Sociology, 1928; Dynamic Social Research, 1933; Social Educatior

1933; Wealth and Culture, 1935; Leisure: A National Issue, 1939.
Dr. Lindeman’s philos0phy that education is life and not merely preparation for living was evident throughout hi

career.

Hotel Reservations

It appears that all Congress sessions can be held within
the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel this year, and many delegates
will want to make that hotel their own headquarters also.
Arrangements have been made with other hotels in the gen-
eral vicinity of the Congress headquarters, however, since

some of the delegates may prefer not to stay at the head-
quarters hotel.

It is not too soon to begin writing for reservations. Cor-
respondence should go directly to the hotel of your choice
and not to the National Recreation Congress.

Bellevue-Stratford Hotel—Singles from $5.50 to $8.00;
doubles from $9.00 to $10.00; twins from $11.00 to $15.00;

WATER, so ESSENTIAL to life for drinking, plant growth,
and cleanliness, is also a source of fun, adventure and
beauty—summed up in the word recreation. Whether eight
inches or eighty fathoms deep, it can be enjoyed by pe0ple
from eight months to eighty years of age. Babies play with
boats in the bath tub or wading pool and men like Lipton,
Stevens and Murphy sailed boats for fun until they were
nearly octogenarians. Reversing the situation, grown men
can have fun in six to eight inches of water competing in
scientific angling with fly or plug in the game called
“Skish,” while a child gleefully digs his toes into the sand
at the edge of a mighty ocean.

Activities in Shallow Water

Shallow pools or ponds may be used by the young for
wading, sailing model boats, racing model speed boats and
Skish.

Model speed boats, with motors of one cubic inch piston
displacement or less, similar to those used in model air-
planes, can be fastened to a strong but fine wire lanyard
thirty-five feet long. The center is a well-anchored pipe
with an annular ball bearing, eighteen inches above the
water, to which the wire is attached. Model seaplane Flying
is rare but presents some interesting possibilities for rec-
reation. .

Skish uses five floating targets, thirty inches in diam-
eter, placed at distances of forty to eighty feet. Each con-
testant is allowed two casts with a %-ounce plug at each
target. A hit scores six on the first try and four on the

second. Thus a double round has a possible score of one

hundred. Flycasting at closer targets is also a good skill
event.

Program For Pools And Fresh Water Beaches

Standard competitive swimming events include breast
and back strokes, medley and free style swimming, diving,
relays and synchronized swimming. Tests (Red Cross,
YMCA and Physical Education), water safety instruction,
pageants, water carnivals and novelty events round out a
good program.

Water polo, water basketball, water baseball, water tag
and water cage ball, which are all nautical counterparts of
their landlocked brothers, will not be included here. Since
this article deals with recreational aquatic activities for
pe0ple of various ages and abilities, only the events that
can be used primarily for fun will be described.

Novelty events are for the recreation of the participants
and amusement of spectators. They involve some skill, dex-
terity, coordination and agility, but seldom require speed
and endurance as we recognize these characteristics in
standard meets. Although the novelty events are all in fun,
officials should have an eye to safety, pay attention to de-
tails, keep the program well in hand, give complete in-
structions for competitors and spectators, and then_start
and judge fairly in a business-like manner. A combination
announcer-M.C., a starter, a clerk and several judges con-
stitute an adequate crew. Twenty-five yards is a good dis-
tance for novelty races.

Balloon Batting Race: Each contestant is given a balloon
or inflated ball which he must butt with his head, while

'imming breast stroke for twenty-five yards.

Block Gathering Contest: One hundred wooden blocks,
inted white, yellow or orange, are scattered on the water
ftcen yards from the edge. All competitors start on a
ivcn signal, gather as many blocks as possible in one min-
tc and then return to the starting line where the blocks are
ounted to determine a winncr.

Jaclrstone Diving: One hundred jackstones are scattered
shallow water. Even non-swimmers may competc, see-
1g who can submerge and gather the most stones in two
linutes.

Tandem Swimming: Swimmers, in pairs, swim alternate
verarm or breast stroke while the front swimmer has his
egs looked under the arms and over the small of the back
l the rear swimmer... Distance—twenty-five yards.

Siamese Twin. Race: Swimmers, in pairs, swim on their
backs, side by side with inner arms locked, using reverse
flutter kick and under-water sculling with outside hands.

Knce Press Race: An inflated rubber ball or balloon is
given to each contestant who must hold ,it between his
knees while swimming with his hands.

Umbrella Race: Each contestant has an open umbrella
which he holds over himself while swimming.

Candle Race: Swimmers carry lighted candles. The first
to cross the finish line with his candle still lighted is the
winner.

Duels Race: Each swimmer is given two pie tins which
he holds in his hands while swimming 25 yards.

lnncr Tabc Race: Each contestant is seated in an inner
tube with his legs and arms outside. The race may be ruxi
using arms only or arms and legs, doing a reverse flutter
kick.

Underwater Balloon Blowing: An eight-inch balloon is
given to each contestant. On an agreed signal, all sub-
merge and blow up the balloons. The first one to come up
with a fully-inflated balloon, or the one with the largest
balloon, is the winner.

Can and Marble Race: Beverage cans of the type that
are capped similar to bottles are used in this event. Ten
holes are punched in the bottom of each can. Cans are
painted several different colors for identification under
the water. Cans' are placed five feet apart on a line fifteen
yards from the end of the pool in about five feet of water.
Each contestant is given five marbles. The race consists
of swimming to the can and putting marbles in it under
water, standing up and holding the can overhead until all
water drains out, then swimming back to the starting line.

Houdini Race: Each contestant is given a large rubber
band. cut from a discarded auto tube. This is put over
the head and around the neck (it should fit loosely). All
jump into water, swim ten yards, crawl through their rub-

ber bands, replace them around their necks and finish the
race.

Ball Pushing Race: An inflated ball or balloon is held
in the hands, arms stretched forward, with body propelled
by the flutter kick.

Pan Race: In the pan race, a deep pie tin is pushed by

MAY 1953

each swimmer, using his chin, mouth or nose. The swim-

ming must be smooth to avoid sinking the pan with wash
or splash.

Activities for Large Bodies of \Vater

Fishing, cruising, canoeing, rowing, sailing, aquaplaning,
water skiing and racing in different types of craft are the
conventional activities for streams, lakes and large bodies
of salt water. Novelty regattas, using canoes, kayaks or
rowboats, includc the comedy events suitable for pienics or
other gatherings whele fun for participants and amusement
for spectators are the requiremcnts. As in novelty swin‘l
events, the equipment, program and officials must be ar-
ranged in detail ahead of time. Officials cannot be lax and
the instructions must be effective but not lengthy. Carc
must be taken to see that contestants are qualified swim-
mers, for safety’s sake. In the following descriptions.
canoes will be used. Rowboats arc possibilities, but are

sluggish and unwieldy. Kayaks are usually propclled with

double blade paddles and are limited in thcir use.

The usual course for novelty canoe regattas is fifty to
one hundred yards, parallel to the beach. Anchored var-
nish cans may be used to designate the starting and finish-
ing lines.

Hand-Paddling Race: Number in eachrcrew to be from
one to four for canoes up to eighteen fcet long. Contestants
paddle only with their bare hands, in any position or
manner.

Duck Race: Same as the hand-paddling race, eXCCpt that
a piece of board, no larger than an average size shingle, or
a pie tin, may be used to increase the area of the hand.
Shingle may be held in the hand, or attached to the hand
by straps.

Broom Race: Ordinary brooms are used as paddles, with
one, two or four members in the crew.

Inverted-Paddle Race: Regular canoe paddles are used

81

in inverted position with the blade portion held in the
hands and paddling done with the grip-end. No speed but
lots of fun.

Statue-of-Liberty Race: Crews of one, two, or four
paddlers, as specified by the regatta committee, paddle with
single-blade paddles while standing in the canoe.

Cunwaie-Paddiing Race: Crews, one-man or tandem, as
specified by the regatta committee, paddle with single-
blades, or with double-blades, as specified, while standing
on the gunwales of the canoe.

T ail-end or Crab Race: This race is more tricky when
run down wind, and with single-blade paddles, with one
man in each canoe. Paddler kneels or squats in the bottom
of the canoe, as far forward as is possible, so that behind
him the tail-end of the canoe is high in the air. He may
not move aft of this extreme position during the race. On
the'starting line, competitors face into the wind, with the
tail-end of the canoe towards the finish line, and with suf-
ficient space to allow for turning the canoe around. At
the starting signal, canoes are turned and competitors en-
deavor to paddle straight-away to the finish. The upwind
race is simpler. Backwater strokes are absolutely prohib-
ited under penalty of disqualification, but any other strokes
may be used and sides may be changed. To win, a com-
petitor must, cross the finish line facing in the direction of
the race, with the tail-end of the canoe high behind him.
Collisions and bumping do not constitute fouls.

Kangaroo or Bouncing Race: This race is always run
down wind, with either one-man crews or tandems. Canoes
take position on the line; at the starting signal, competitors
must mount the gunwales, near the stern, and pr0pel the
canoe toward the finish line by alternately bending and
straightening their knees to “bounce” the canoe along.
Paddle may be held in the hands for balance, but it may
not be used for stroking, bracing, or steering. Contestants
falling overboard may reboard their canoes and continue.

Rescue Race: (A valuable event for safety training.)
Teams consist of two men and two canoes, designated A
and B, with one man in each canoe using single-blade or
double-blade paddles, as specified by the regatta commit-
tee. All the A’s take position on the starting line, with their
team mates in the B canoes astern of them. At the starting
signal, A’s race forward,” and B’s move up to the starting
line. When the A’s are approximately halfway down the
course, a second signal is given, whereupon all A’s must
immediately capsize wherever they are, then right their
canoes, stow the equipment and await the arrival of their
rescuers while holding onto their canoes. Upon the same
second signal, B’s race forward and draw up alongside
their partners to effect the rescue. A’s climb into their B
canoes; both men then draw the A canoe upside-down
across the gunwales of B, right it, and then launch it empty
of water. Painter of A canoe is then secured to the stern
of B, and the race is finished with both teammates in B
canoe, towing the rescued A canoe. To qualify at the fin-
ish, a team must have all the equipment with which it
started.

The aquatic version of the ancient knightly art of joust-
ing. No armor, but plenty of action. Paddlers are busy too.

Numbered Slab Race: One-man or tandem crews com-
pete, paddling single-blade or double-blade. Shingles or
similar pieces of light wood, are prepared with a number,
not over one-half-inch high, marked on one side only.
These shingles are scattered widely, fanwise, on the course.
By secret lot, crews draw corresponding numbers. At the
starting signal, crews board their canoes, race out and en-
deavor to find the shingle bearing their number, and re-
turn with it to the starting point. If an incorrect number
is picked up, it may not be retained, but must be thrown as
far as possible in any direction.

Greased-Watermelon Race: Any size crews may take
part, single-blade or double-blade, as specified by the re-
gatta committee. A large watermelon is heavily greased
and placed afloat well out on the course. At the starting
signal, crews board their canoes, race out, and in a free-
for-all, endeavor to retrieve the melon, which becomes the
property of the crew securing it.

Canoe-ailing Contest: Two canoes, each with a bucket
wiclder and two paddlers in it, are required for a match.
The bucket men dip water and throw it into their oppo-
nent’s canoe, endeavoring to swamp it. Dipping water out
of, or bailing, one’s own canoe is prohibited: No platforms
are used; bucket-men may stand amidships or kneel as
they please. If metal buckets are used, they should be at-
tached to the gunwale or to a thwart by a lanyard.

Tug-of—War Contest: Tandems, or four-man crews, hand-
paddling with single-blades or double-blades, take part as
specified by the regatta committee. Canoes are secured,
stern to stern and about twenty feet apart, by means of a
double towing-bridle attached to the stern thwart or seat
of each canoe and encircling its end so that a %-inch or
heavier line can connect the center point of each under-
water bridle. Canoes take station in the center of the
course, with the line taut, and the bow of each canoe an
equal distance from a point designated as its respective
goal. Following the starting signal, the winner is the canoe
whose bow comes up to, or passes, its own goal line while

RECREATION

dragging the opponent’s canoe stern first. This contest may
also be judged by establishing a centerline, up to or across
which the winner has to drag the loser’s bow.

Hurry-Scurry Race: This is conducted similar to an ob-
stacle race. One course could require a contestant to make
a short dash, then crawl under a tightly pegged-down net,
or through a small barrel, run to end of pier, dive in and
swim to a moored canoe and board it; paddle back to pier,
tie-up canoe, cat a large pilot cracker and then whistle

"Yankee Doodle.”

Dipper Race: Four-man crews; two men to paddle, with
single-blade paddles, and the other two dipper-men armed
with tin dippers or #10 cans. Dipper-men ride in an op-
ponent’s canoe, in midship position, and endeavor to fill
and swamp the canoe before the paddlers can drive it across

the finish line. Dipper-men are prohibited from tipping the
canoe to swamp it.

Overboard or Bang and lamp 0m! Race: One-, two-, or
four-man crews, paddling single blade, can be used. Start
as in an ordinary spccd race. When leading crcws are
about half-way along the course, a second signal is given,
whereupon all crews, wherever they are, immediately go
overboard without upsetting their canoes, then swim be-

ncath them, reboard them on the opposite side, and race
to the finish line.

Progressive Relay Race: Four-man crews; single-blade
paddles. Two men of each team in the water at the far end
of the course; one man in the canoe, at the start, and one
in the water. All paddles in the canoe. The first lap
paddled by one-man; pick up second man and paddle tan-
dem for return lap; pick up third man for next lap; and
pick up fourth man for final lap. Canoes may be turned at
the end of each lap, or paddlers may merely reverse their
own positions.

Bang-and-Co-Back Race: One-man, tandem, or four-man
crews; single-blades only. All crews race 'forward at the
starting signal. On each subsequent signal, given any time
at the option of the regatta committee oHicial, crews shall
immediately proceed in the opposite direction, either by
turning their canoe or by reversing their own position.
Race may finish back at the start, or at the opposite end of
the course, after the third, fourth, or fifth “reverse” signal,

as previously announced to the spectators but not the com-
petitors.

Bathtab Race: One- or two-man crews; may be run as a
hand-paddling race or using single-blade paddles. Crews
line up at the start, seated in the bottom of their canoes,
with legs beneath a thwart. At the starting signal each
crew leans sideways to fill its canoe until completely

swamped, and then proceeds to race swamped to the finish
line.

Crawfish Race: One-, two-, or four-man crews; single-
blade or double-blade, as specified by the regatta commit—
tee. Crews line up for the start, with the stern of all canoes
toward the finish. At the starting signal they proceed to
race backward to the finish.

Submarine Race: Distance, about five canoe lengths.

MAY 1953

Crews, one- or two-man. Crews line up for the start, stow
paddles, capsize canoes to obtain the maximum air-trapped
space beneath, and steady them in such position until the
start. At the starting signal competitors duck into the air
space beneath their canoe, and by swimming “blind” with
kicking only, endeavor to propel the canoe to the finish.
The frog kick is best. NOTE.———One or two rescue canoes
should always follow along the fringe of the race, and com-
petitors should be warned to return to the outside upon the
first trace of dizziness.

Piggyback Race: Two-man crews; single-blade or dou-
ble-blade. One partner sits on his kneeling partner’s shoul-
ders and propels the canoe from start to finish.

Beetle Race: Four men capsize each canoe and then hold
on to it, two on each side, keeping logs and one arm free
for propulsion. Twenty-five yards is sufficient for this race.

Cunwale Walking: The canoeist stands on the gunwales
of his canoe near one end and, by hopping, makes his way
down the gunwales to the opposite end. He turns on the
bow deck and hops back. This may be run against time, or
as a contest of skill to select contestant who can complete
the trip without getting inadvertently ducked.

Change End Race: This is an ordinary race with two in
a canoe. At the mid-point, the bow paddler crawls to the
stern and the stern paddler crawls over him to the bow.
The race is resumed to the finish line.

Paddle and Swim Race: Each canoe has a painter on it
for this race. The paddler pr0pels his boat to the halfway
mark, then he umps in, with the painter in his mouth, and
tows the empty canoe to the finish line.

Tilting: A small deck is fastened near the bow on each
of the contesting canoes. In the absence of a platform, tilt-
ers may stand on the gunwales. The paddler is usually
seated on the bottom of the canoe. 'Bamboo poles with in-
flated balls fastened to the ends (with the aid of plumbers’
suction cups or funnels) are used as lances in this modern-
ized version of jousting. Falls are scored when the op-
ponent is pushed overboard. Six fouls, such as stepping
from the deck, kneeling on the deck, using the pole for
other than thrusting or parrying, sliding the pole through
the hand or jumping in the opponent’s boat, constitute a
fall. Matches are usually decidcd by two out of three falls.

Crab Race—Hand Paddling: Each competitor lies prone
on the stern of his canoe and paddles, stem first with his
arms.

0 The novelty swimming and paddling races described in

It Cost Us$10

In the course of conversation on one of the playgrounds
in Alexandria, Minnesota, an eleven year old girl remarked:
“Gee, I wish we could go horseback riding. It costs too
much at the riding stables.” The remark was echoed by
several other youngsters and was brought to my attention.

Mrs. Ed Johnson, owner of the Sunnyside Riding Stables
and an officer of the Circle A Saddle Club, is an active
member of the Alexandria Community Council. We passed
on these remarks to her and she became vitally interested.

cheral meetings were held with the members of the
saddle club and an outline of information and action was
set up. The members of the club agreed to provide the
horses, help with the actual instructions, and cooperate in
every way with the recreation department. Publicity was
provided for the new activity by the local papers, school
bulletins, radio station, and word of mouth.

The first meeting of possible participants included regis-
tration, introduction of the staff at the stables, getting ac-
quainted with the horses by name, the first lecture, and a
short ride.

Fourteen meetings followed. The youngsters were taught,

by actual demonstration and practice, the proper approach
to a horse, bridling and saddling, care and grooming, lead-
ing and haltering, and so on, with safety being stressed
throughout the entire program.

TraIIic laws concerning horses on the public highways
were explained by Mr. Stevens, a state highway patrolman.
Care and treatment of a horse injured or showing signs of
illness were explained by a member of the local veterinar-
ian’s office. Mrs. Johnson discussed general riding “do’s”
and “don’ts.” The class memhers themselves provided pic-
tures and information on the various breeds of horses.
After each meeting, every youngster was given a short ride.

The Circle A Saddle Club members continued assem-
bling materials for a mimeographed booklet which would
be presented to each youngster at the completion of the
course. Class lectures, in condensed form, would he in-
cluded.

At thc completion of the fourteenth lesson, all materials
were assembled, including drawings and illustrations of
interest. The final weeding out was completed and the in-
formation was mimeographed.

A total of sixty-two boys and girls, ranging in age from
five to thirteen, used ten horses a total of 289 hours. Circlc
A Saddlc Club members contributed 746 hours in instruc-
tion, research, discussion and compilation of the mimeo-
graphed booklet. As recreation director, I worked with the
club members in coordinating this project.

The cost to the recreation program—ten dollars for sten-
cils, paper and mimeographing. The results-~——Gayle Schnie-
derhan voiced the opinion of the class members: “I hope
that you will do this again next year. I learned a lot and
it was fun. I want to do it again!”

NOTE.—The January, ’53 issue of The Bit and Spur and
February issue of The Western Horseman carried articles
on this project. Their information would be of value to
recreation directors interested in working out a project 0]

7THINK it’s wonderful . . .” The words of the song were
echoed over and over by the fifteen thousand people in
{oanoke, Virginia, who had attended a series of thirty-odd
ommunity sings during a nine-week summer session. These
vere held in neighborhood parks three evenings a week.
“he original plan called for the staging of a program in
'ach of the three scctions of our city once a week, but in—
erest mounted to such a degree, and requests from the
.utlying districts for'similar'programs became so numerous,
hat we were lucky to get back to the larger areas twice a
eason.

Following the good old American custom of singing to-
;ether, there was other entertainment, too. Youngsters
lrummed guitars, sang, gave readings and danced, and

here was always hoedown hillbilly music.

Where did this talent come from? “We don’t have to look
or them,” one playleader remarked when the sing was
aken to her park, “the youngsters just beg to be on the
)rogram. About fifty asked to participate in this one.”

But the good thing about the sing was that it was a com-
nunity affair where families gathered with their neighbors
'or an evening of fun. “The whole family is together to-
1ight,” one mother remarked, “and it doesn’t cost a cent.”

Led by George Shaw, volunteer song leader and show-
nan who was active in USO during the war, and accom-
)anied by Mrs. William E. Davis atithc piano, the crowd
:ang old favorites, such as “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary,”
’olk tunes, popular song hits and several hymns. One of the
ligh spots of the entire series was a brief devotional period
For world peace led by Bill Moore, a ministerial student who
works with the department of parks and recreation during
the summer, followed by the “Lord’s Prayer” sung by our
cader. '

The general plan of operation went something like this.
A stage about thirty feet square and benchcs to seat the
sldcrly people attending were set up in the afternoon by
our park maintenance crew. To the stage was added a
piano, a fifty-two by seventy-inch portable screen and a
public adress system. A balopticon lantern slide projector,

using three and one-half by four-inch slides, was used to
throw the words of the songs on the screen. Upon the sug-
gestion of one of the spectators, portable spotlights were
installed 011 each corner of the stage and rigged up by city
electricians to throw the prOper light upon the leader and
pianist. It was surprising how much these lights increased
audience participation.

Our programs began with ahout thirty minutes of enthu-
siastic group singing. Then, to give the crowd a rest, we
presented a fifteen-minute special attraction, always using
at least one good act as bait to get others from the audience
to perform. By this time, the participants were ready to
sing again, and usually this was the best fifteen minutes of
the entire evening. But to keep them from growing restive,
we stopped the singing early and showed a movie, appeal-
ing to young and old alike. Travel pictures were particu-
larly well-received, also wild life movies, animated cartoons
and stories of life under the sea. These films were made
available to the department without cost by local business
firms. Neighboring park playlcaders were always 011 hand
to pitch in and help, and served as oflicial hosts and host-
esses, lcnding an atmOSphere of genial hospitality to the oc-
casion.

People came from near and far to attend the show.
Families brought summer visitors and nearby communities
cooperated and attended. In addition, a regular clique of
show-followers deve10ped, their familiar faces beaming
among the crowd wherever we went.

“I think this is fun,” commented one woman who “just
took a notion to come on up to the park and bring the kids.”

They looked as though they were having a good time.
Someone else nearby remarked that he sure liked to sing
but had a terrible voicc. “That’s why,” he added, “I like to
sing with a group of people.” “Me, too!” added several
others.

We, in Roanoke, feel that we have hit upon a way to en-
courage not just youngsters, and not just teen-agcrs, but
family units to use our park facilities andienjoy activities
planned for their entertainment. We are looking forward
to next year with enthusiasm when community singing will
be given broader emphasis in our summer schedule, and we
shall meet the request of those who sang with us—--—“please

come back again.”

AT THE END of a Tuesday afternoon, when it was quite

impossible to determine whether I was just too young
or too old, the bottom of my trouble was clearly defined
with two feet that were aching and screaming for a nice, hot
bath. They were the outcome of a four-hour escapade with
some four hundred members of the Mobile and New Or-

Mobile.

City at 7 A.M. for a four-hour ride to Mobile on eight buses.

Awfully Old—So Young

To be quite frank—I just don’t know, even now. I felt
vfully tired when Tuesday came to an end—and awfully
d. But I am so young. .

They are young too, though—from sixty to ninety-eight
ears young. It is not the immaturity so frequently seen in
)ung people, however, that is without reason, pride, edu-
ltion or thoughtfulness. These boys and girls of yester-
3ar laughed and had fun with dignity plus. Why they do
as a question of mine that was easily answered.

They all like the independence of being with companions
ho “cake-walk” and have children or grandchildren to
rag about. Their get-togethers take them back to thc
good ole days” physically as well as mentally.

How do they do it—keep young—is another question
rat has as many answers as there were folks at the party.

Keeping Busy

What most of them told me however adds up to a few
ood pointers. If you keep busy, don’t worry, and stay
rith young people, you will just never grow old.

Mr. C. C. Coubil, Sr.—who is one of the younger men]-
ers of the Mobile Golden-Age Club at sixty-six—stated
efinitely that it is very easy to keep such a youthful spirit.

“Get out with the young people,” he advised, “and keep
ctive. Co to ball games, dance a little and work.”

These are the rules and regulations that members of both
lubs follow when they hold their regular meetings, too.
'he Mobile clubbers meet the third Thursday of every
lonth at the Spring Hill Avenue Recreation Center, where
1ey dance and sing and talk. New Orleans groups—six dif-
:rent ones were represented by the visitors—have followed
imilar programs since organization about five years ago.
'or them, the bus ride to Mobile and the few hours spent
ere and the trip back was just another meeting.

Two of the bus drivers claimed their passengers “ate,
ang and talked politics” coming over. Sixty-nine-year-old
Irs. Ida Beattie kept eating lemons so she could “sing and
Ill: more” at the party.

ng partner, whose grace and rhythm puts all my past part-

The oldest young person at the party, from Mobile, was
Mrs. C. Myers. She is ninety-eight years old and cute as a

tell who was chaperoning who.

Ninety-four And Still Dancing

New Orleans was represented by its oldest man and

Rosendale still dances and has belonged to the organization
since it was started. She loves to be in parades. Mr..O. C.

Maybe though in fifty years or so, by following the en-
thusiastic advice of the two golden-age clubs, which don’t
stop dancing until the phonograph needle is lost, I’ll be gal-
avanting around too. I’ve already turned in my application
to the Golden-Age Club of 1987—my sixticth annivcrsary.

C Says Mrs. Maitre, who is superintendent of recreation in
Mobile, “I have been in recreation work for some time and
I have attempted and accomplished many projects and pro-
grams but never have I experienccd anything like our gold-
en-age party that day. It seemed to have a little bit of every
possible objective or hope all mixed up with memories and
turned out the most perfect party fOr some three hundred

Are your golden-agers interested in creative writing?

HE SAN FRANCISCO SENIOR CENTER
recently celebrated its fourth birth-
day. This was an important occa-
sion because it marked the rapid
growth of a project which now serves over one thousand
San Franciscans, sixty years of age and over, in a center
open five days and two evenings a week, and in four neigh-
borhood clubs. A staff of two full-time directors and two
part-time recreation leaders work with an enthusiastic
group of volunteer leaders and teachers who are respon-
sible for its interesting and diversified program.

One of the most significant activities has been the Crea-
tive Writing Class. An eager and enthusiastic core of six
to eight members initiated the classes, with a volunteer for
a leader, but many others find their way intermittently to
the classroom to “taste and try.” At times there are more
than twenty sitting around the table reading and criticizing
one another’s work.

There is a wide difference in the background and ability
of the regular class members, but they all share a desire to
put their thoughts and experiences into words. Some of
them have had less than a grade school education. Two,
foreign born, have the added handicap of language diffi-
culty. One of these, however, has had the habit of keeping
a little notebook over a period of many years. As a result
of his careful and often amusing observation of the passing
scene, he contributes much to our discussions.

The teacher has used a number of techniques in cneour-
aging the class members to eXpress themselves. At one ses-
sion each person wrote two descriptions of a familiar street
corner—the first, as it looked to him when he felt gay and
happy, and the second, on a day when he felt blue and de-

pressed. The latter provoked a great deal of amusement.
and had a therapeutic value.

 

Much time is spent trying to eliminate flowery adjectives
in favor of strong, descriptive verhs. There seems to bc a
tendency in people of this age group to be overly senti-
mental as soon as there is a pen in hand. Many of the
exercises have been the rewriting of flamboyant passages
from badly written magazine articles or their own work.

Early in the experience of working together it was agreed

that the monthly birthday party, honoring center mem-
bers whose birthdays had fallen within that month, should
be an occasion of dignity and of inspiration. A ceremonial
prepared eSpecially for the occasion was needed. Members
of the Creative Writing Class agreed it was their job to do
and they set to work enthusiastically. It proved to be an
interesting and rewarding assignment, calling for many
group discussions. That there are many disadvantages in
marking off another year the members agreed; but also
they recognized the many compensations which should be
stressed. Each member wrote several paragraphs on the
joys and advantages that old age brings. When these were
read in class, there was further discussion. From these
papers the ideas and words that pleased the class were
chosen so that each part in its final form represents group
thought and was not the work of any one person.

The class spent two months on this project before the
final compilation was made. They all felt rewarded for
the time spent because of the pleasure that came in the
heart warming exchange of ideas.

The Creative \Vriting Class provided a very significant
experience for those who participated. It awakened the
powers of observation and gave a renewed interest in life.
It focused the attention of the individuals on the life around
them rather than on petty annoyances. One member of
the group statcd that since she had been coming to the
Senior Center, and to the writing class in particular, she
had been happier than she’d ever been. She had found out
how much she liked doing something she’d never had time
to try before. The real satisfaction and pride that the
members of the group experience each month as they pre-
sent the ceremonial has made the ’class,.to them, one of the

most important activities in the whole program of the
center.

A program that is more than an annual derby.-

Cat ish, Grannies--

704m! 70666 723 36.7

MONO THE best remembered impressions of boyhood days
A on the farm are the fishing expeditions for catfish, crap-
pies and an occasional bass. These jaunts to a neighbor-
hood stream provided many a happy experience; and today
fishing is still one of the finest forms of recreation for either
juveniles or adults. If this activity is not included in your
summer playground activities, then our experiences with a
juvenile fishing program in Peoria, Illinois, may give you
some ideas that can be utilized in your community.

For several years, Howard Kenny, outdoor editor of the
Peoria Journal, our evening newspaper, had been promot-
ing an annual kids’ fishing contest. These events sponsored
by the paper and Fishing Incorporated were for boys and
girls under sixteen years of age. They were all-day af-
fairs staged at a five-acre lagoon in Glen Oak Park. The
park, lying within the city limits is readily accessible by
bus or auto and the derbys, as they were called, proved
immensely popular with the youngsters.

During the summer of 1948, the recreation board offered
its assistance in the staging of the derby. Our offer was
readily accepted; and playground leaders helped publicize
the event among playground participants and assisted Mr.
Kenny and his volunteers in its supervising. When well
over a thousand junior fishermen turned out, we decided
that something more in the fishing line than an annual
derby should be made available to the playground partici-
pants.

Thus, in 1949, the aid of the four local fishing clubs was
enlisted and, in addition to the big annual derby, four fish-
ing excursions were scheduled during the summer. A dif-
ferent club sponsored each excursion, and four or five
playgrounds were assigned to one Specific excursion—so
that all participants from the nineteen playgrounds were
able to attend at least one. Club members used their cars
to tran8port the youngsters from the playgrounds to a lake
or stream nearby. Although leaders stressed the details,

and bulletin boards gave accurate information, children
were often unable to eXplain to their parents exactly where
they were going fishing and with whom they were going.
For this reason, a certain amount of parental disapproval
caused these trips to be less successful than was antici-
pated. Girls especially were often not permitted to join
them. The answer to this was obvious—to have wcekly
fishing derbys right in the city with the playground lead-
ers, known to the parents, supervising the program.

Aftcr several conferences—attended by Mr. Kenny, the
recreation board superintendent, and a representative from
each of the local fishing clubs—a cooperative plan was de-
veloped that would permit each organization to play the
part for which it was best suited; and the Advisory Council
for Junior Fishing was formed. Membership was limited
to one representative each from the Izaak Walton League,
the Peoria Casting Club, the Peoria Chapter of Illinois

On Saturdays, fishing in the lagoon was limited to the boys and girls under sixteen years of age.

es’ Rod Club, the Peoria Journal and the recreation board.

The advisory council submitted a detailed plan to park
oard officials who agreed to limit fishing in the lagoon to
IOYS and girls under sixteen, on Saturday mornings. The
tark board also agreed to post the area and police it, to
ee that there was no poaching, and to provide storage
pace for the fishing tackle which each fisherman was re-
:uired to provide for himself.

Mr. Kenny, who was elected general chairman of the ad-
'isory council, submitted a request to the state conserva-
ion board—which agreed to keep the lagoon well stocked
with pan fish.

The recreation board made the fishing program a part of
he summer playground program, and leaders’ working
IOUI‘S were arranged so that one leader would be respon-
ible at each playground—40 meet the children at the play-
ground and escort them to and from the lagoon, and of
'ourse, to assist them and act as their leader during the
ishing period.

It would appear that the program was all set. We had
he facility, the fish were in the lagoon and we had the
eadership necessary. However, the Advisory Council for
'unior Fishing was not satisfied to sit back after arrang-
ng for the bare essentials. The council, further, develoPed
1 number of procedures and techniques which definitely
'fiected the success of the program.

First of all, a system of scoring points was deveIOped.
)ut not without considerable discussion and debate. The
)ig question, of course, was whether the winner should be
he fellow who caught the most fish, regardless of size, or
whether the prize should go to the fisherman who landed
he largest fish. It was decided to weigh all fish and award
)ne point for each ounce of fish caught. One of the ad-
visory council members loaned us an accurate scale, and a
File card system was arranged for keeping a record of each
fisherman’s catch.

It was also felt that good sportsmanship, patience, inter-
:st and good behavior should be rewarded; so it was de-

MAY 1953

cided that each child attending should be given five points
for each Saturday he or she attended.

The problem of how to keep a record of attendance with-
out causing a lot of confusion, or making it a time-consum-
ing job, was solved when the idea to issue fishing permits
was suggested. Fishing derbys were planned for nine Sat-
urday mornings during the summer, so nine 5’s spaced
evenly apart were printed along the top and side edges of
the “Junior Fishing Permit.” The lower edge contained
nine blank spaces where the fisherman could keep a record
of his weekly point totals.

A simple set of rules was devised and printed on the back
of each fishing permit.

Each Saturday after fishing was well started, a recrea-
tion board supervisor toured the entire edge of the lagoon
and punched the number designated for that particular day
on each fisherman’s permit. When a fisherman presented
his catch for the day, his fishing permit was checked and
in addition to receiving one point for each ounce of fish
caught, he was awarded an extra five points for good be-
havior for that day and any previous days on which he had
attended but had not been fortunate enough to land a fish.

The Sunday morning paper agreed to carry a news story
on Saturday’s fishing and the standings each wcek, showing
the number of points. earned, of the twelve or fifteen lead-
ing fishermen. The standings were followed closely, as evi-
denced by telephone calls to the recreation board office
bright and early Monday morning on two occasions, when
errors in totalling points were made and children had not
been credited with the five points for attendance and good
behavior.

The Journal and each of the fishing clubs agreed to do-
nate twenty-five dollars each toward purchasing prizes.
Identical first, second and third prizes, consisting of fish-
ing equipment, were awarded to girls and boys for the
highest scores during the summer. A form letter sent to
seventy-five merchants brought in a total of fifty two, three,
and five dollar merchandise awards. These were used as

91

weekly prizes; and here, let me voice a word of warning——
be prepared for at least one or two tie scores each week.
Volunteers from the fishing clubs acted as instructors at
a training session for playground leaders and gave instruc-
tions and advice on methods to be used in fishing for cat-
fish and crappies with which the lagoon was stocked.
Considering that rain and cold weather hampered the
program three of the nine Saturdays, results were good.
Attendance ranged from a low of 127 to 833 and averaged
125 youngsters. There were practically no behavior prob-
lems; three or four children fell into the lagoon but were
promptly rescued by a recreation leader or parent.
Merchants, parents, the fishing clubs, and the commu-
nity as a whole received this program enthusiastically. The
only complaint came from a mother whose daughter wanted
to stay home, and skip the family’s planned vacation, in
order to be present at the final derby when the grand prizes
were awarded. Our ready assurance that daughter’s prize
would be saved for her, if she finished in the winners,
solved that one. When she returned from her vacation, a
letter informing her that she had won third prize in the
girls’ division awaited her; and when she and her mother
brought the letter to the recreation board office, the gleeful
expression and sparkle in her eyes—when she saw the tackle

box she had won—was well worth thc many hours of plan-
ning required of the superintendent. Wc will wager that
this little girl will be an ardent fisherman for the remainder
of her days. Which leads us to say that we don’t espccially
like the awarding of prizes to gain attendance, but if this
practice will create an interest that can be followed after
the participant becomes a wage-earning adult, we feel the
practice justifies itself.

In conducting the weekly derbys, wc learned a number of
things which should be kept in mind if you are planning
a similar program. Start and end each derby at the same
definite time each week; and don’t make the period too
long. The younger element will grow restless over too long
a period. Derbys in Peoria were started at 9:00 A.M. with
the blowing of a whistle over a PA system, and a whistle
signaled the end at 11:30 A.M.

Have your state conservation board make tests of the
water in your lake or lagoon and stock it with fish suitable
for that particular water. Stocking should be done suf-
ficiently in advance of your first derby so that the fish are
accustomed to the water and will feed.

Train a crew of three or four leaders to weigh and re-
cord the catches rapidly as soon as the fishing for the day
is ended and award the prizes immediately thereafter.

RECREATIOD

 

Have you an abandoned swimming pool? Lodi’s now offers fishing in heart of city.

r'o

An unsightly mass of concrete known
as thc old City Baths existed in Lodi,
California, and the commission for
recreation and parks long consid-
ered the problem of what to do with it.
Once the scene of much splashing, joy-
ous fun, it had been abandoned as a
swimming pool in the early years of
World War II and had hecome the pas-
sive receptacle of fallen leaves and oth-
er incidental debris—certainly not one
of the beauty spots of an otherwise
beautiful town.

But things are different now! Once
again you can hear the shouts and
laughter of youngsters on its edge.
They’re not swimming though; they
are fishing. and having the time of
their young lives.

The development of an abandoned
-nutcloor swimming pool into a fishing
pond which has becomc a successfuL—
and certainly the most pOpular—phase
of our summer recreation program
was really simple. This is the way we
[lid it.

First of all, we were lucky in having
several factors to our advantage. The
area was partially shaded by trees
)1! one side. This helped to keep the
water from getting too warm in the sun.
Vext, the pool itself was somewhat
arger than ordinary, being approxi-
nately one hundred by seventy-five feet
and ranging in (lepth from three to nine
feet: but best of all, there was a shal-
Ion. walled area on one corner of the
pool, connected by outlet to the main

pool, which had been used as a wading
pond for very small children. This was
perfect for a fish spawning bed.

“It’s a darn good idea,” said Carl
Freischlat, the fish and game commis-
sioner of the Lodi area. “Go ahead
and get started. I’ll see that you get

the fish when you’re ready. By the.

way, 510 you know that bluegills will
take a fly?”

So we got started. We had to patch
a few cracks in the pool walls, which
had deve10ped in the ninc-year interval
since it had last hold water. cht we
covered the entire bottom with a couple
of inches of coarsc gravel and stone.
We set some old pipe. in concrete and
strung a couple of ropes completely
around the edge of thc pool. After all,
we didn’t want any youngster falling in,
even if it was an old swimming pool.
Finally we filled the pool with water
from the city mains, arranged a small
constant inlet and a drain, and we were
ready for the fish.

They came, in the special treated
tank and trucks which the California
Fish and Game Commission uses to
transport fish_two thousand fat hluc-
gills and perch, seined from Charley
Nichols’ private pond ten miles out of
town. Charley is an ex-cop who—next
to kids—loves fishing; and he donatcd
the fish to the youngsters with his
blessing.

All this was in February of 1952.
The opening was scheduled in Junc to
coincide with the beginning of the sum-
mer playgrounds. On opening day
nearly three hundred youngsters, and
scores of curious parents, clamored at
the gates and thronged the sides. The

signal to begin was givcn, and five sec-
onds later the first bewildered bluegill
was flopping on the bank. Of course,
any project like ours must have strict
rules to govern it and to ensure its
success. We had each youngster pre-
sent a fishing permit to obtain entry to
the pool. These were issued free of
charge at thc city recreation office, and
they cnabled us to check not only thc
child’s identity but his participation
each week. On the back of cach card
was a list of thc rules which we set
up in the interests of safcty, sports:
manship and conservation. ‘
It is obvious that such an activity
necessitates thc strictest pool side su-
pervision. For instancc, for safety’s
sake we found it necessary to forbid
any kind of overhead or side arm cast-
ing, but we had to learn this thc hard
way. "
Every director of recreation knows
that the philosophy of public recreation
is dedicated to providing service for
as many as possiblc. This can be done
only by prcscnting a well-balanced rec-
reation program to the community. We
know that not every youth is athletic,
and surely interests are many and di-
versified. With few exceptions fishing
can be enjoyed by everyone if the op-
portunity is presented. Its carry-over
value is immeasurablc, and whilc a pro-
gram such as ours is confcssedly no
substitute for actual field and strcam
expericnoe, it is a preparation. It points
the way to it, and the way is not far.

DUST ELIMINATION was one of the
three topics on which informa-
tion was requested in the inquiry on
surfacing recreation areas conducted
in 1952 by the national committee
studying this subject. The 153 reports
received from park and recreation ex-
ecutives relating to this subject indi-
cated that the greatest dust problem is
centered on ball diamond infields and
in lesser degree on tennis courts, ap-
paratus areas and bridle trails. Most
of the information submitted related to
methods used to eliminate dust on
bascball diamonds and the following
is a summary of the results as re-
ported.

W ater—Water is the most widely used
material in the attempt to eliminate
dust, being reported by 51 per cent
of the authorities. It is, however, with-
out question the most costly to apply
and perhaps to control, unless one has
squicient funds to install a modern
sprinkler system. Fourteen California
areas reported that their major dust
control is gained through water sprin-
kling and this method was reported in
varying degrees from all sections of
the country. Eleven other states re-

94

port no other control agent.

Oils—The reported experience with
commercial oils have been limited, ac-
cording to the reports. Approximately
19 per cent submitted information on
this material, with twelve areas record-
ing successful control, seven areas me-
diocre results and ten areas unsatis-
factory experiences. The failure of the
oil manufacturer to furnish complete
use specifications for his product for
the various types of soils is the major
reason for many unsuccessful uses.
Several areas reported clothing stain
experiences, messy soil conditions for
several days duration and the tracking
of oil into adjacent buildings.

Calcium Chloride*—The following is a
summary of the replies as they relate
to the use of calcium chloride.
Arizona reports the failure of cal-
cium chloride in the three areas re-
porting. California reports successful
use in three areas, fair control in one
area and absolutely no control in two
other areas. The reports from this
section of the country indicate that
the use of calcium chloride is worth-

less in areas of low humidity. Cali-

Dust

fornia has both low and high humidity
areas and it is in the high humidity
areas where calcium chloride has given

. a satisfactory degree of dust control.

In the northwest, Washington re-
ports two failures because of low hu-
midity, one because of high humidity
and one area reporting fair control.

In the central-west belt, Minnesota
reports both the successful and unsuc-
cessful use of calcium chloride. One

area in both Nebraska and North Da

kota reports successful control.

In the midwest area, Wisconsin ané
Michigan report seven areas of suc
cessful control and one area with fail
control in the use of chlorides. Illinois
and Ohio report three areas with con
trol and two areas of unsatisfactory re
sults. Indiana reports one area wit}
fair control and one with poor results

Authorities, with but few exceptions,
are using the manufacturers’ applica-
tion Specifications; that is, from 1/2 to
11/2 pounds per square yard of area
lreated—the exceptions were down to
14 pound and up to 3 pounds per
square yard——-with from two to several
applications per season. It was further
revealed that in areas where success-
ful use is obtained rates and times of
application have direct connection with
the relative humidity of the use-area.
ln scvcral low humidity sections of the
country the chlorides were used with
absolutely no results since there was
insufficicnt moisture in the air for the
two special properties of calcium
chloride to become active; the prop-
erlics being hygroscopicm—which means

thc ability to absorb and hold mois-

ture, and deliquescent——-which means
the ability to liquify or dissolve itself
in the moisture it absorbs. If the users
in low humidity areas had been sup-
plied with complete manufacturers’
data they could have been saved both
the cost of the material and the appli-
cation labor costs. Calcium chloride
at a normal summer temperature of 77
degrees and a humidity of 78 will ab-
sorb approximately 2% pounds or .33
gallons of water (almost  gallon) in
about three hours after application.

It can be assumed that if a use-area
is favored with the ideal soil or soil
aggregate surface—a soil containing
enough sandy or gravelly material to
keep it from getting muddy when wet
and enough clayey material to keep it
compact and firm when dry, and if the
lnanufacturers’ application specifica-
tions are followed, then, and then only
will calcium chloride give satisfactory
control of dust. Areas in Michigan,
New York, New Jersey and Massachu-
setts seem to have the climate and the
soil mixes _for the ideal earthen play
surface since they report the greatest
success with calcium chloride.

A bit of valuable information is
noted from those who have had suc-
cessful control in its use. The Depart-

ment of Municipal Recreation of Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin, reports: “We have
found that the ‘pellet’ calcium chloride
has distinct advantages over the ‘flake’
type and have been using the pellets
several years. They provide better cov-
erage, are longer lasting, are easier
applied and seem to add up to lower
over-all cost per application.” If the
other areas of the country hope for
successful dust control with calcium

'chloride they must experiment until

they discover how many gallons of
water per square yard are required to
bind their soils suitably, the relative
humidity and normal summer tempera-
ture of their area, and other factors.

What is the answer? There must be
an agent that will give better and more
widespread satisfaction for this costly
and provoking problem. It should be
to the interests of the manufacturers
of the chlorides and oils to increase
their research on this problem. Per-
haps they can be induced to furnish
more concise product data and appli-
cation Specifications based on climate,
soil and use-area values. The volume
and scope of the problem are sufficient
to assure a profitable dollar return to
the industry that furnishes a satisfac-
tory solution at moderate cost.

Conference for National Cooperation in Aquatics

O The fourth Conference for National Cooperation in
Aquatics, held at Yale University late in 1952, was attend-
ed by forty-nine individuals representing twenty national
organizations. A summary of the reports developed by the

graphcd form. The reports deal with the following sub-
jects: “Community Action in Aquatics,’
“Organization and Conduct of
Aquatic Events” and “Principles in Planning and Con-

96 RECREATI

i ’URING THE MONTH of July, the visitor to Humboldt

Park in Buffalo, New York, glimpses among the trees
a most colorful Indian Village of painted tepecs around
which are gathered some 218 children ranging from six
to fifteen years of age. This is the summer program of the
Buffalo Museum of Science, known as the “Tepce Cam-
poree.” The program, four weeks in length, is presented
during the month of July on Mondays through Fridays
from 10:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. A charge of ten dollars is
made for the entire session; the children provide their own
lunches and transportation to and from the park.

A carefully planned and varied program consists of na-
ture study, arts and crafts, Indian lore and dancing, folk
dancing, singing, games, story telling, camp crafts, out-
door cooking, hiking and council fires.

The children are divided into age groups of
ten, each led by a counselor. Of these groups,
each four are under the supervision of a head
counselor. A trading post houses supplies, and
medicine lodge treats scratches and bumps.

Each child is given a forest-green fclt ban-
doleer, to serve as an honor band, upon which
various colored felt symbols of the activities
in which he participated will latcr be sewn. A
small bright yellow canvas haversack is sup-

, plied for his drinking cup and other personal
belongings.

Each day brings new activities and proj-
ects; and each unit has its trash containers,
drinking water, and supply boxes located on
its camp ground. The units are scattered
throughout the section of the park near the
museum, yet far enough apart to avoid dis-
turbing each other. The program, of course.
is gauged according to the age of the child
and is so planned and coordinated as to tie
the various activities closely together. For in-

 

stance, nature hikes are sometimes utilized to gather mate-
rial in the field for nature crafts. Arts and crafts projects
are planned to provide Indian headdresses, costumes, mu-

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 

sical instruments and so on, for Indian dances and cere-
monies. Geology hikes provide flint, for flint and steel fire
making, and tiny campfires are used for outdoor cooking.

The world of nature, the lore of primitive peoples, their
tools and crafts, the fundamentals of living together and of
exchanging a thousand adventures, the acquiring of skills
and the understanding of a thousand mysteries have been
easy to present—for the children are living in this environ-
nent. Discipline creates few problems, since everyone is
horoughly interested in the colorful activities going 011 all
about him. Each child dwells in the realm of his own
magination. and is carefully led into self expression and
ractical knowledge by his counselors.

Recognition for completed effort is awarded. If the child

learns five birds, he is given the small blue felt symbol of a
bird. If he learns to know five trees, a small felt tree is
awarded to him. In this way he is able to accumulate
thirty to fifty honors. These are publicly presented in the
council ring twice weekly with great ceremony.

The council fire program consists of fire making, nature
reports, games, songs, stories, draniatics, pageants, con-
tests, with all the color of Indian costume and ceremonial.
Here the child learns to stand on his feet and express him-
self, also to behave with decorum and politeness. He par-
ticipates in all the activities and leariis to take defeat with
victory in the games and contests.

To providc a symbol and an incentive for keeping camp
grounds clean, a strange and mysterious person named
after the mythical “Nanahojou” of the Indians, and wear-
ing a grotesque mask and Indian costume, presents a weird
and wonderful bird named the “Mugwump” to the group
which has the cleanest and best looking campsite. Need-
less to say, the area in which the camporee is held is, each
year, in much better shape than the rest of the park.

The camporee provides a colorful and happy picture, and
visitors come from many places to observe it. Numerous
pc0ple from foreign lands st0p to see the children in action.
Although 218 children were registered the first year, over
400 were turned away because of the lack of sufficient lead-
ership. The Council of Social Agencies of Western New
York is greatly interested in extending this work in all city
parks and in nearby areas, and a study is in progress to
secure state funds for the purpose.

This idea can be utilized by any museum, institution or
organization, provided it has a park or some land adjacent
to it and has the leadership necessary to train the required
staff. A well-trained staff is absolutely necessary. All per-
sonnel is paid, even if only a small amount. A program of
counselors-in-training is being developed in Buffalo, where-
by good leadership material among older boys and girls is
selected and allowed to participate in all training courses
and to assist for one year with the various children’s groups.

The tepee camporee provides an opportunity for the
smaller museum or organization to do a good outdoor com-
munity job for the summer, without cost except for staff
leadership time. Materials used are mostly scrap, and the
ten dollar fee is sufficient to cover all other expenses.

Parent reaction has been unbelievably enthusiastic and
other organizations have been most 

 

anxious to send children to the cam-
poree. The success of the project is at:
tributahle to the careful program plan-
ning by Mrs. Sylvia Booth Brockner
and Miss Emily Colvette. supervisors.

School-City Cooperation

PART II

Seattle, Washington

A coordinating cooperative program
of site acquisition and facility devel-
opment has been worked out in Seattle
between the board of park commis-
sioners and the city’s school authori-
ties. The new Laurelhurst community
center illustrates how the idea has
worked out. A city planning commis-
sion survey showed that the district
badly needed enlarged facilities. The
Laurelhurst Community Club agreed
with the finding and put its weight be-
hind a request for more space. A oint
park-school staff committee, meeting
each week, ironed out details of financ-
ing, construction, administration and
maintenance and developed a plan
which received official approval. Un-
der this cooperative scheme, the Lau-
relhurst school gym was enlarged, ap-
paratus added and social rooms pro-
vided.

The statement of intention drawn up
by the park-school board joint com-
mittee makes clear the basis for the
ncw cooperation:

“It is the general intent of this agree-
ment that two public agencies join 
the construction and operation of a
public building, each paying its just
and fair share of the costs prorated as
to use of facilities required. It is fur-
ther intended that all such joint use
shall be exercised in an efficient and
economical manner so that such pub-
lic service may be extended to the
largest possible number.”

In May 1950, contracts for the Lau-
relhurst center were signed and con-

struction begun. The total cost of en-
larging of facilities was $128,381. Of
this amount, the school board paid
$49,120.51; the remainder was paid
by the park board. The facilities have
had steady use ever since.

At Magnolia, another school-recrea-
tion center, the park department fi-
nanced the expansion of the gymna-
sium and also financed the social wing
of the school. This wing is under con-
stant park department supervision, but
is maintained and heated by the school
janitorial force, with cost billed to the
park department monthly. This ar-

rangement prevails in all instances,

where park department funds are used
to help finance construction.

The intra-department and inter-de-
partment use of the facilities is con-
trolled through a permit procedure.
For example, the park department has
the use of all suitable school gymnasi-
ums and auditoriums from 3:00 P.M.
to 10:00 P.M. on school days, and from
10:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M. on Saturdays
and holidays. It pays the actual jani'
torial costs for such use. In turn, the
park department grants the school au-
thorities permission to use its stadium
and certain athletic fields on the same
basis.

The efficiency and economy of the
joint system have been a joy to both
school and park boards, and to the city
council; and the community has been
supplied with the facilities it needed
without having to face an increased

tax schedule. Mr. Paul V. Brown, the

superintendent of parks, comments:
“As an indication of the possible econ—
omies that may be effected through this
joint school-park planning, financing,
operating, and maintaining of inte-
grated facilities, it costs the park de-
partment approximately $150,000 a
year to maintain and operate nine .of
its fieldhouses, whereas we pay to the
school district only $15,000 per year
for the use of nine comparable facili-
ties. These figures do not include the
supervision of activities, which is the
same in both instances. In addition, of
course, the taxpayer is saved from
capital expenditures that would total
millions of dollars, since our Class A
fieldhouses now cost more than $350,-
000 to construct, whereas our partici-
pation in a properly designed school
facility will range from $50,000 to
$100,000?”

too far outside its park and recreation
plan. To make plans functional, the
director of recreation and a represen-
tative of the board of education sit on
the sub-division review in the city
planning office and are able to make
known their needs and wants.”

He points out that where the areas
adjoin, the city effects closing of ex-
isting streets or refuses dedication for
proposed streets. If the larger total
acreage belongs to the schools, their
engineering department develops the
plan with a slant on their needs for the
traditional physical education program.
'The plan is subject to approval and
acceptance by the city. When agree-
ment is reached, a cost analysis is
made. If structures, such as toilets or
permanent improvements, are to be
erected on the city-owned land, it is
agreed that the city will finance them,
but the board of education may erect
what are known as removable items
such as backstops and fencing. The re-
verse becomes true if the improve-
ments are to be made on school-owned
land. The tax-dollar cannot be mixed
because each agency is autonomous
and responsible to the public, but funds
can be combined and the cost divided
as indicated.

To cite one instance, a joint improve-
ment that will cost approximately
$50,000 has been approved, with most
of the work on city-owned land. The
city has detailed $22,500 to initiate
dirt removal, curb removal, location
of playfield, grading and surfacing.
The board of education will supply
fencing and other items to cost approx-
imately the same amount. There is no

pat formula. Each situation stands on
its own merit.

Spokane, Washington

Cooperation in the acquisition, im-
provement and operation pf school and
city recreation properties in Spokane
is achieved through an advisory coor-
dinating committee. , The committee
consists of two members of the park
board and two members of the school
board, the superintendent of schools.
and the recreation director of the park
department. Board representatives on
the committee, which was formed in
1945, are appointed by the two board
presidents. Area and facility plans are
usually initiated by the department ex-
ecutives, but all such plans and proj-
ects are submitted to the coordinating
committee for review and approval.
Their recommendations are then re-
ferred to the two official boards for ac-
tion.

The advisory committee meets on
call of the chairman, and the proceed-
ings of the meetings are reviewed at
the regular meetings of the two boards
by designated members of this joint

tion superintendent work closely in de-
ve10ping plans for the acquisition and
the improvement of new areas and fa-
cilities.

School prOperties are designed with
the cooperation of the park department
in order to provide adequate centers
for community recreation outside of

school hours. Park playground areas,
so far as possible, are located adjacent
to schools and are equipped to serve
the schools as well. Each department
purchases the area needed for its spe-
cific use. The park board purchases
the area intended for recreation pur-
poses adjoining the school site and
equips it at its own expense. The
school board fully equips the units on
its own prOperty, but school areas are

usually confined mainly to the building
site.

School facilities are assigned to the
recreation division of the park depart-
ment for use outside of school hours
under the supervision of the recreation
director. Park facilities are assigned
to the schools, as needed for school
activities, under the direction of the
superintendent of schools or his desig-
nated assistants.

The cost of this joint operation is
distributed as follows: The park de-
partment pays for the recreation lead-
ership and‘janitorial services during
the hours such facilities are used by
the park department. The schools fur-
nish light, water, heat and other items

 

that pertain to the maintenance and
upkeep of the buildings. The equip-
ment used in the conduct of the pro-
gram for the most part is furnished by
the park department, except as the rec-
reation director and the superinten-
dent of schools find it advisable to use
school equipment.

Norfolk, Virginia

Schools, libraries, low-cost housing,
parks and playgrounds are included in
a ten-year multi-million-dollar capital
improvement program. The procedure
followed in the development of school
and recreation facilities in one neigh-
borhood illustrates the method used in
carrying out features of this program
which was deve10ped by the Norfolk
Planning Commission. In selecting the
sites for the elementary school and
neighborhood playground which are
located in relation to a public housing
project, consideration was given to the
space standards established by the Vir-
ginia State Office of Education and by

the Fedcral Housing Authority for low
rent housing sites. Using the table of
minimum areas determined by the
number of dwelling units in the proj-
ect, the Norfolk Housing Authority
was able to grant the use of five acres
of its land to the school, thus supple-
menting the seven-acre site which had
been determined for the school. The
park and recreation department is
landscaping the twelve acres, laying
out the play areas, furnishing and in-
stalling the play apparatus and pro-
viding equipment and materials. It is
assisting with thc entire site plan of
both the school and the housing proj-
ect and not a tree is cut down, a shrub
moved or new one planted except after
consultation with the park department.
Although the functional plans of the
school building and the housing com-
munity building conform to the pur-
pose each is intended to serve, both
buildings were primarily planned so as
to be easily adapted to a wide variety
of leisure-timc activities for children
and adults under the leadership of the
park and recreation departmcnt.

Joint planning resulted in mutual
agreement which assured economies
and well-planned facilities. For exam-
ple, the elementary school could not
well provide a regulation gymnasium
with showers and lockers within its ap-
pr0priation. Ncither could the housing
project provide such a facility in its
community building. As the plan has
developed, however, the school will
build an auditorium and the housing
project will build the gymnasium.

sium use. Seats in the school auditor-
ium are movable so it can serve as a
multi-purpose room. It has separate
heat controls and outside entrances so
it can be shut off from the rest of the
school when in use after school hours.
Other units in the school building can
be cut off and easily supervised when
in use by the park and recreation de-
partment, which furnishes the recrea-
tion leadership for the playground,
playfield, housing community building

and school.

ReSponsibility for maintenance of
the facilities is as follows: The park
and recreation department maintains
the playground-playfield; the park and
recreation department and the housing
authority share in the maintenance of
the project community building; the
park and recreation department pays
for the janitor service in the school
when that building is used for recrea-
tion activities under its leadership. All
janitor service in the school is under
the supervision of the custodian of that
building. Public utilities for the proj-
ect community recreation building are
paid for by the park and recreation
department.

Omaha, Nebraska

Deve10pment of the Kellom School-
Recrcation Project in Omaha is an out-
standing example of cooperative cnter-
prise. When the pe0plc of Omaha in
1946 approved the establishment of a
park and rccreation commission and
voted bonds totaling $1,637,000 for the
deve10pment of much-needed recrea-
tion facilities, the need for cooperation
between the park and recreation de-
partment and the school board was
recognized. One of the projects sug-
gested for deve10pment on a c00pera-
tive basis was the Kellom School site.
The school was locatcd on a very small
piece of ground adjoining a housing
project with over eleven hundred chil-
dren. The project involved thc pur-
chase, by the board of education, of
half of the site selected for thc en-
larged school and community center

and purchase by the park and recrea-
tion commission of the othcr half of
the site. A portion of the area was ac-
quired through condemnation, the bal-
ance through direct purchase. The title
of the grounds acquired by each de-
partment is held by that department.

In deve10ping the plan for the area,
no particular attention was paid to
property lines. The plan included a
swimming pool with a wading pool, a
hard-surface area, tennis courts, two
softball diamonds, one baseball dia-
mond, a children’s playground and a
new grade school building with gym-
nasium. The swimming pool was built
on ground purchased by the board of
education. The agreement between the
two boards is that in case the pool
should cease to function, it would be
the responsibility of the park and rec-
reation commission to fill up the pool
and remove the pool building. Most of
the recreation facilities, other than ball
fields, are also on school prOperty.

The school building and gymnasium,
as well as the other facilities, were dc-
signed for the combined use of school
and community. Rooms were arranged
so they could be used in the daytime
for school purposes and at night for
recreation. The park and recreation
commission has the responsibility for
developing all outside facilities, thc
board of. education for erecting the
building and maintaining and operat-
ing it for school purposes.

The park and recreation commission
takes over the operation of the rccrea-
tion section of the school building at
4:00 in the aftcrnoon until 10:00 or
11 :00 at night. It also has permission
to use the building on Saturday morn-
ings and aftcrnoons and Sunday, but
during these periods it is required to
pay for any manpower needed for 0p-
eration.

Richmond, Virginia

The status of the school board in
Richmond facilitates c00peration be-
tween the city and the schools. Public
schools are under the jurisdiction of a
five-man board, the members of which
arc appointedxby the city council. The
board, through its administration staff,
makes policies, rules and regulations,

RECREATION

prepares budgets, and performs most
of the functions of over-all govern-
ment, except the levying and collection
I of taxes and appropriation of funds.
School buildings, grounds and equip-
ment are pr0perty of the city.

The department of recreation and
parks is one of six operating agcncies
under the jurisdiction of the city man-
ager.

A careful evaluation of Richmond’s
immediate needs, both for new public
recreation facilities and new public
school buildings, in relation to esti-
mated revenue, indicated that it was
impossible to meet all desirable or even
all essential needs. Several new school
buildings were being constructed, and
additions were being made to old struc-
tures, and new municipal recreation
areas were being acquired and devel-

ager and city council. The charter of
the City of Richmond ad0pted in 1948

also states, “The department of recrea-
tion and parks shall be permitted to
utilize grounds and buildings under the
jurisdiction of the school board at such
hours and on such days as they are not
in use for other educational purposes,
subject to such reasonable rules and
regulations as the school board may
establish, and provided that the dc-
partment of recreation and parks shall
be responsible for any damage or extra
expense arising from its use of the
schools’ grounds and buildings.”

No written contract with respect to
capital improvements, land acquisition
and new deve10pment exists hetween
the two bodies, but a working relation-
ship between recreation and schools has
been established, as follows:

opcd. The need for planning and dc-

important place in setting up the plan
and making it work.

A) Plans for new school buildings and
areas developed by the school board.
By written instructions from the su-
perintendent of schools to his staff and
contractual architect, such plans are re-
viewed and approved by the director of
recreation and parks. All reasonable
suggestions and recommended changes
from the department of recreation and
parks are incorporated in plans for
school facilities. New school sites,

acreages, needs, locations and plans for

deve10pment are also reviewed by the
staff of the department and often al-
tered to meet recreation needs. Sincc
funds for acquisition and deve10pment
come from the same source and titles
remain in the name of the city (not the
school board) and the city charter
specifies the conditions under which
school facilities may be used, the ques-
tion of whether outdoor areas are as-
signed to the administrative jurisdic-
tion of schools or recreation depart-
ment is of minor concern. If need ex-
ists, the department of recreation and
parks adds lights, play equipment,
bleachers, backstops, tennis courts, as-
phalt areas and develops school play
areas with approval of the school prin-
cipal and the superintendent.

In all new school buildings the dc-

partrnent requests that the following be
provided:

1) Outside entrances to wash rooms,
cafeteria, auditorium, gymnasium, li-
brary, shops or any other special facili-
ties. Also an arrangement wherehy in-
side doors can he locked securely when
outside entrances are in use and access
through building is not desired. Sepa-
rate buildings for auditorium and gym-
nasium are desired.

2) “Cut oils” (fire door or folding
gates) so that cafeteria, gymnasium,
auditorium, and six class rooms (more
or less as needed), preferably on first

floor, can be heated and used sepa-
rately.

 Folding gates or suitable ar-
rangements that will prevent access to
the entire huilding when only a por-
tion is needed.

4) Movable tables and chairs in
cafeteria and class rooms which are
used for community purposes.

5) Storage space for recreation sup-
plies, games and equipment—in the
form of extra closcts in class room or
a separate storage room, conveniently
located.

6) Softwood floors on auditorium
stages; dressing rooms and storage
space arranged in a practical manner
for drama presentations.

7) Arts and crafts with running wa-
ter, work tables, good lighting, and
storage closets or cabinets.

8) Entrance lounge and check room.

101

9) Office space for the staff of large

centers.
B) Plans for new recreation areas
and outdoor facilities developed by de-
partment of recreation and parks. Just
as school indoor facilities are made as
useful as possible for joint recreation
use it is the policy for municipal recre-
ation areas, where possible, to be ad-
jacent to public schools and made
adaptable for school uses. School offi-
cials therefore review plans for the de-
velopment of play areas and make sug-
gestions which are incorporated inso-
far as possible.

Although there is joint planning and
use of areas and facilities, action of the
city council assigns jurisdiction of the
areas, including maintenance. Except
for damages directly related to a spe-

cial activity, both school and recreation
departments maintain the areas directly
under their jurisdiction, including costs
of electricity, heat, water, gas. Pro-
gram costs, including leadership staff,
overtime for janitors, maids, and fire-
men, are assumed by the respective us-
ing agency. There is no charge for rent
and no charge for janitorial help when
activities are conducted during their
regularly assigned working hours. The
using agency only pays extra costs for
special services or overtime over regu-
lar duties.

J. A. Reynolds, the director of rec-
reation and parks, states:

“In our situation, there are instances
where both schools and recreation have
outdoor space adjoining each other,
complementary to each other, and each

has the jurisdiction including mainte-
nance of its own space. Responsibility
is clearly defined. In instances where
one agency either constructs or main-
tains a facility or area under the juris-
diction of another agency, the agency
under whose jurisdiction the area
comes reimburses the one performing
the service. We have no joint owner-
ship of indoor facilities.

“It is my feeling that before long
we will be constructing community
centers with gymnasiums near schools
(particularly the old school buildings
which are not very adaptable for recre-
ation purposes) which will also be used
for school purposes. There is growing
community interest for such an ar-
rangement which appears to be of mu-
tual advantage to all concerned.”

J aseph Lee Day

0N A July day this summer, the

twenty-sixth to be exact, children
and their parents will gather on play-
grounds all over this nation, to pay
tribute to the man who fathered the
playground movement in this country
——Joseph Lee. General public recogni-
tion of his contribution to American
life has grown steadily through the
years. The celebration of National Jo-
seph Lee Day was established in 1938.
An article, “Godfather of Play,” pub-
lished in the Christian Science Moni-
tor, appeared in The Reader’s Digest in
1940.

In that same year, Susan Lee, a
mcmber of the board of directors of
the National Recreation Association,
wrote:

“In looking over the material for
Joseph Lee Day and thinking over the
various plans which are being made, I
have tried to keep in mind what my
father would have liked to see, himself,
and what ceremonies scem to best ex-
prcss him and his philosophy.

“I think a simple, spontaneous, local
expression of play, in its various mani-
festations, is the best kind of material.
That activities and ceremonies should
be real and first-hand, from the point
of View of the children taking part,

102

seems to me of first importance; and
as a corollary to this, that each com-
munity should work out its own pro-
gram so that it expresses that particu-
lar group or locality, and not some-
body else’s conception—a vital point,
both from the point of view of the cre-
ative, or play spirit and that of democ-
racy. The songs and dances, plays and
pageants should have joy, simplicity,
and beauty for both participants and
onlookers. Anything which is forced,
or artificial, or secondary should be
avoided. One of my father’s character-
istic sayings, used with another conno-
tation, but equally applicable here, was,

‘Don’t tie on the flowers, water the
plant.’

“As to the more personal and direct
memorial aspect, my father believed in
the value of symbolism, of making our
national heroes and ideals visible, al-
though he would have declined the hero
role for himself. But even here, it was
the spiritual and true value behind the
man or the ideal which seemed to him
important, as witness the pageants put
on by Community Service on Boston
Common for the Fourth of July which
sometimes had no direct connection
with the Declaration of Independence.
He always went, although he was never
living in town at that time, and in these
pageants took the keenest pleasure and
delight, rejoicing in the beauty of the

setting, with the lights reflected in the
brimming Frog Pond. Perhaps in this
connection it is only fair to state that I
think he believed, also, in the more
direct form of civic ceremony, provided
it avoided what he called ‘eagle scream-
ing’ and 123% per cent Americanism.’

“My father would not have objected
to stories of a hero but he would have

abhorred any idea which created a
bloodless, sentimental stereotype, or
any method of forcing a form of ex-
pression on the children. In this con-
nection, Washington is a case in point.
My father admired Washington tre—
mendously, but realized his low visibil-
ity as a hero, especially as presented
to children. Once when I was teach-
ing, he helped me to pick out incidents
from Washington’s early life which
would appeal to the dramatic imagina-
tion of children, and thus help Wash-
ington to come alive; as, for example,
the time when he carried a message
through the trackless forest to the
French fort on the Ohio, swimming a
river and spending the night on an
island without a fire, for fear of the
Indians. He knew that the cherry tree
story was not only untrue, but would
carry little or no appeal to the normal

red-blooded child. He felt that Parson

Weems had a lot to answer for.”

CHARLES K. KING’S dream of a program of life enrich-
ment for the people of Mansfield, Ohio, is now to be

realized. Mr. King died last May, and his former home,
Kingwood, and related buildings, forty-six acrcs of grounds,
together with a very generous endowment havc been set
aside “to provide a well arranged program for educational,
community and recreational activities.” This quoted phrase
is from Mr. King’s trust agreement which outlines, in de-
tail, how he desired to have his home and the accumulated
treasure of his lifetime given to the pe0ple.

It has been a very great satisfaction to me to read this
final document, as well as to look over our NRA file and
the record of how this dream took shape in the mind and
heart of Charles K. King, for it was not an impulsive act.
“Kingwood Center” is the result of a generous desire plus
careful study, on his part and on the part of his associates,
many field visits, conferences, careful advice of lawyers,
financiers and workers in the National Recreation Asso-
ciation who dreamed with Mr. King.

In 1936, in conference with Fred M. Riddleberger, Mr.
King’s attorney in Cleveland, the association proposed:
confcrences with Mr. King in Mansfield; visits to the as-
sociation’s headquarters and to other community projects;
a study, by the NRA, of the needs of Mansfield, and an
analysis of how Mr. King’s property might best help to
serve these needs. Mr. King was the most eager of all to
explore, to consult and to expand his own idea so that the
ultimate program would be of the greatest value to the
pe0ple of Mansfield and to the State of Ohio.

About a year later, the association made a study of Mans-
field. E. Clark Worman, did the detailed field work, and
many others on the staff were consulted.

It was interesting to see Mr. King’s vision take shape
as time went on. He. talked first of an “Education Center.”
W e soon learned that Mr. King had a deep interest in gar-
dening, nature, music, drama and art. After thoroughly
discussing the relationship of education to recreation he
stated that what we meant by recreation was really what
he had in mind when he originally spoke of education. He
was impressed with L. P. Jacks’ book, Education Through
Recreation, which seemed to give him a satisfactory philos-
ophical background for the things he wanted to do.

 

MR. RIVERS is the assistant executive director of the NRA.

KINGWOOD CENTER

T. E. Rivers

He wanted to interest the
adults first, believing that if
“the right people in the town
were doing the right things the
young pe0ple would imitate
them.” He thought of providing
a place, determining the kind
of buildings necessary, helping
the people locally to catch a
vision of what the center could
become, insisting on the right
kind of leadership—these were

C. K. King

in the framework.

He appreciated the values to the people, not only of
seeing and hearing the best in music and drama, but also
of having a chance to participate themselves. He put
careful thought on priorities. He wanted to start the
program with what was already available, his home and
gardens, and then add to it. From his analysis the
endowment, at that time in the late thirties, would be

adequate for what he called the “first unit.” He hoped and
believed that there would be funds for the whole project.

Basically, Kingwood Center is to provide a well-rounded
program of educational and recreational activities for the
pe0ple of Mansfield. The first step will be the development
of the gardening and nature activities. When this has been
“creditany deveIOped” the trustees are to erect a building
suitable for carrying on other aspects of the program.

The project is well endowed, managed by a board of
trustees consisting of George L. Draffin, William A. Spring-
er, Lowell Bourns, D. O. Meese and B. F. McLean, and will
be under the executive direction of Dr. R. C. Allen, horti-
culturist of broad experience, who began work there on
April 1.

As early as 1939 Mr. King considered starting this pro-
gram before his death. We ourselves urged this because of
the satisfaction he might experience in helping to launch
and work out the plans he had so carefully developcd. He
finally ruled this out, however, believing that at his age
he was not up to facing all the problems involved.

Charles K. King has joined the increasing number of men
and women who have such faith in the recreation movement
that they have given large sums for the purpose of enrich-
ing the lives of others through music, drama, nature, arts
and crafts, sports and other leiSUre-time programs.

Kingwood Center was well conceived and carefully
planned. The National Recreation Association is proud to
have had a share in this notable community service and will
watch with great interest its implementation in the life of

Mansfield.

Boating is an exciting and ever popular activity for blind campers.

The following material, prepared to be of use in the
orientation of the new counselor, at Camp Lighthouse, who
has had little experience with handicapped people, is pre-
sented in the hOpe that it will be of help to students and
other workers with the blind.

What happens to a person who becomes blind? What
kind of person is one who has never seen? What kind of
camp is Camp Lighthouse?

Camp Lighthouse is one of two summer camps owned
and Operated by the Lighthouse of The New York Associ-
ation for the Blind. It is located on the south New Jersey
coast, ahout ninety miles from New York City.

Our campers are people, men and women of all sizes and
shapes, some intelligent, others dull, some quick, somc
slow, the strong and the weak, the aggressors and the
meek, differing from one another as all human beings
differ. There is, however, a strong bond of identity among
blind pe0ple. This is based not so much on the fact of
sharing a similar physical handicap as upon the experi-
encing of similar instances of the general lack of under-
standing of the blind.

Camp Lighthouse was built in 1926, and is a centralized
camp with fifteen buildings spaced in a large circle on onc
acre of cleared area. These consist of a dining-hall, social
hall, ten cahins, two washrooms and a garage-tool storage
building. Thick, impenetrahle woods surround the camp
on the west, north and south. To the east is an extensivc
saltwater meadow which separates the camp from the
beach and Barnegat Bay. We reach the beach for swim-
ming and hoating by a four-hundred-yard railed board-
walk which has been constructed over the soft marshland.
Because of the thousands of acres of sea level woods and
meadows, Ocean County is mosquito territory. Mosquito
control has bcen a dillicult and continuing problem. Out-
door evening programs are almost impossible.

Our camp buildings are sturdy, well-built and com-

pletely screened. Standing in the center of camp, facing
west, the dining-hall is directly in front at the number
twelve position on a clock. Going around to the north,
clockwise, are cabins one through five and the north wash-
room. This is the women’s side of camp. Continuing
around to the east, the play field is at three o’clock and the
social hall at six o’clock. Then to the south are cabins six
through ten and the south washroom. This is the men’s
side of camp. Camp Lighthouse is a small camp, and we
average thirty-six campers per a two-week session. The

largest number we can accommodate is forty-six.

Purposes

Many of our blind and visually handicappcd campers
lcad limited lives in terms of mobility, variety of new ex-
periences, and independence in choice of social and rec-
reational activities. To a blind city person outdoor activ-
ity, if at all possible, means dependence on others for
guiding, or the strain and tension of traveling alonc, then
trying to compete with and adjust to sighted persons who
are out for recreation, too.

At the camp there is a minimum of dependcnce in
moving about and in participation in a varied program of
outdoor activities. As already indicated, the locations of
buildings, play areas, dock and bcach are simple. The
paths are well-marked, the boardwalk is straight and safe.

For many of our campers, camp is the most significant
change in anyear of routine living.* It means so much to
a blind person, cven if it is for two weeks only, to get
away from rclatives who are worn by the extra little serv-
ices a blind person requires; to be able to go outdoors at
will; to be ahle to choose from a variety of recreational
activities; to have three good meals a day in a friendly,
casy atmosphere; and to be accepted as an individual.

Socialization is one of our important objectives. Blind
people tend to be isolated from, and to isolate themselves
from, normal group relationships. Our permissive, flexible

program encourages wholesome social relationships. There
is a lot of friendliness, easy talking, laughing, and inner
relaxation.

We try to interest our campers in learning skills within
I'lheir competencc as individuals and as handicapped per-
sons. We have found it unnecessary to attempt the specta-
cular or thc bizarre. If we have to prove anything, we
want to prove that our campers are people. With activities
such as swimming, boating, hiking, dancing, outdoor
games. indoor table games, group singing, social group
games. cabin care, and just moving about outdoors, there
is more than enough content to meet the nceds and wishes
of our campers.

Although the average stay can be of only two-weeks
duration, some real and lasting adjustments and accom-
plishments have their origins in the relationships and
skills bcgun at Camp Lighthouse.

Campers

Professional workers in our lield refer generally to all
our campers as “blind.” It is immediately obvious, how-
ever. that about three campers out of five have some us-

Exv 1953

    

able vision. These partially sighted persons are visually
handicapped to the extent of approximatcly eighty pcr cent
loss of visual eiiiciency.

Campers with the most vision arc not necessarily the
most adequate and independent campers. Thc extcnt to
which a person accepts himself as he is; the extent to
which he develops good attention, association and reten-
tion tcchniques; the extent to which he supplements the
little scen with what he hears, smells, feels, and his
muscles remember—these determine his general ade-
quacy and independence. Some of our totally blind
campers require no assistance except in situations where
accident and injury are possible.

There is general agreement among psychologists that
about ninety per cent of what we know comes through our
visual experiences. This is why it is so much morc diHicult
for a blind person to adjust himself to the natural and
social environment which in our society is so dynamic
and complex. ThrOUgll nccessity, practice, and education
a blind person learns to utilize the other senses as effective-
ly as possible. However, there is much in our environment
too large, too small, too hot, too cold, too delicate and too
dangerous to touch and handle. Many things make no
sound, have no odor. Evcn aside from this, a blind campcr
could not possibly hear and feel everything he might and
should know about the things around him. Therefore,
blind pe0ple have to depend a great deal on spoken or
written description. Added to this dependence on descrip-
tion is the inescapable fact that physical blindness gives a
general impression of helplessness, particularly in the arca
of movement. As a result, many sighted'persons are prone
to project dependency and helplessness to the total be-
havior, volition, judgment and emotions of all the blind
persons.

Blind persons react to this categorizing with strong ag-
gression, showing hostility, irritability, anger, and some-
times deliant, irrational independence. Others react with
regression, becoming helpless and almost complctely dc-
pendent. Those who can. adjust to the stereotyped attitude
of the sighted, accept, at least consciously, the realistic
limitations imposed by -blindness. They then proceed to

plays a minor role. The extent to which so many blind
persons have been able to achieve adequate status person-
ally, economically, and socially is a great tribute to them
as individuals.

Implications for the Counselor

What should the preceding mean to our camp staff?
Most important of all is the fact that our campers are indi-
vidual persons. For the most part they are just average
persons who have learned to live with their visual handi-
cap. They are eager to participate in camp activities, and
want the assistance of understanding leadership.

There, of course, will be some campers who have not
made an adequate adjustment to their handicap. One must
remember that patterns of behavior and character have

their roots deep in heredity and past experiences. Even a

severe shock like blindness will not completely change the
basic structure of a personality. These less adequate camp-

ers need all the understanding and intelligent help we can
give them. For them Camp Lighthouse has to be even
more positive and meaningful.

Because of the implications of helplessness which blind
people have to face continually, our campers are sensitive
about supervision that is either patronizing or authorita-
tive. This type of supervision, particularly from young
counselors, seems to be verification of loss of individual
and adult status. At the same time, our campers do need
some supcrvision. Regardless of how adequate the adjust-
ment, blindness does increase accident potential; sighted
assistance and adaptations are needed in many indoor and
outdoor games and camp activities; and then, coeduca-
tional camping requires supervision. One must remember
also that the campers are our guests and that we, as repre-
sentatives of the agency, are responsible for their safety
and well-being.

Proper supervision at camp is. best exercised through
genuinely interested participation with the campers in the

106

program activities. The friendly, confident presence of a
counselor is about all that is needed to assure acceptable

camper behavior.

Program

In formulating our camp program we had to be mindful
of the following facts:

1. Our campers are adults, eighteen to forty-five years
of age.

2. Little screening and selectivity is possible; this means
that within each group there will be campers who have
widely differing backgrounds educationally, culturally and
economically.

3. Relative adequacy in adjustment to the handicap
varies from person to person.

4. Approximately three out of every five campers have

some useful vision.

5. The camp period for each group is only two weeks.

6. The physical setup and location of the camp limits
the program to daytime outdoor activities.

7. Our campers are adults and we went them to have
a significant part in program planning.

The program framework of a typical Camp Lighthouse
day follows:

8:00 A.M. Reveille

8:30— 9:30 Leisurely breakfast

9:30—10:30 Bed making and bunk cleanup

10:30—12:30 Activities on permissive basis: swimming, boating,
sun bathing, fishing, clamming, hiking, berry pick-
ing, outdoor games such as baseball, basketball,
pushball, horseshoe pitching

12:30— 1:00 Cleanup and relaxation before lunch

1:00— 2:00 Leisurely lunch

2:00— 3:00 Best period; quiet games, reading and letter writing

3:00— 6:00 Activities similar to the ones in the morning pro-
gram plus beach hikes, boat trips and town trips

6:00— 6:30 Cleanup and relaxation before dinner

6:30— 7:30 Leisurer dinner

7:30—— 9:00 Activities which are less strenuous than those in the
preceding activity periods, walk on boardwalk, in-
door bowling, indoor table games—cards, checkers.
chess, bunko, ping-pong—record playing, group
singing; just relaxing and getting ready for the
evening program

9:00—11:00 Evening program—planned formal program for
Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday eve-
nings; informal unplanned program for Sunday,
Tuesday and Thursday evenings

11:30 Taps '

A Camp Lighthouse day is a good day; it’s an easy day;
and it’s a long day. We make every effort to give the
counselors adequate time off, varying assignments, stimu-
lating meetings and conferences.

To be a happy, worthwhile counselor one must be a
healthy, rugged, outdoor person who sincerely likes peo-
ple. One has to be quite a social person, too, for dancing,
group singing, group games and table games are the prin-
cipal content of our evening programs. One should enjoy
good camp meals—because we have them; and one should
get a kick out of seeing the campers enjoy them. Above
all one must want to be intelligently helpful to those who
need understanding assistance.

RECREATION

Calcium Chloride for Dust Control

Now is the time to be thinking
about controlling dust for the balance
of the summer. If you wait until parks,
playgrounds other
areas have dried out, your dust prob-
lem will be much greater than if you

and recreation

do something about it now.

Park and recreation authorities wise
in the ways of controlling dust know
that if they follow recommended pro-
cedures for the use of calcium chlor-
ide dust is no great problem. They
take advantage of the natural mois-
ture now in the ground, and take steps
to preserve that moisture for the bal-
ance of the season. They apply cal-
cium chloride early in the year and
thus retain moisture for long periods.

If you can hold down the dust
clouds and make them a part of your
recreation area, the major part of the
dust control job is done. One way to
do that is to keep those particles moist
so they cannot blow away as dust.

Recommendations for the use of
calcium chloride include an initial ap-
plication before playgrounds and other
areas dry out. This can be made with
a hand shovel or simple lin1e' drill-type
spreader, as shown in the illustration.
The main object is to spread the white
{lakes of calcium chloride uniformly
over the surface. Apply them at a rate
of one to one-half pounds per square
yard of surface. If another applica-
tion is needed later in the season it

should be added before the surface has
dried out.

It is extremely important that the
surface area be moist when you apply
calcium chloride if you want to get
best results. Spreading it at this time
of year holds the natural moisture in
the surface. If you apply it later, be
sure to moisten the surface first.

Calcium chloride goes immediately
to work once it has been removed
from its moisture-proof lOO-pound or
25-pound bag. It attracts moisture

MAY 1953

from the air and dissolves itself in
that moisture (see illustration). It re-
sists evaporation for a long time.

 

A flake of calcium chloride dissolves
itself in moisture attracted from air.

Special problems occur in parts of
the country where low humidities and
high temperatures are encountered
during summer months. Especially in
these areas, remember that calcium
chloride should never be applied on a
dry surface.

Dry temperatures play hob with the
properties of calcium chloride, as they
will with plain water. But you can
make the water last longer if you ap-
ply calcium chloride with it.

You may not be able to maintain a
smooth surface on areas during the
entire season if fines in the surface
are blowing away as dust. Compac-
tion and smoothness of the surface are
sacrificed if the materials are not well
graded. Materials should be of uni-
form size in recreation areas, and soil
hinder or fine material as needed
should be included. In this way com-
paction is possible if proper surface
moisture is maintained.

In sections where material has been
loosened or ravelled, binder soil
should be added. This should consist
of sand-clay, sandy-clay
other fine material which aids in bind-
ing the particles.
Drainage of recreational areas is .also

loam, or

together larger
extremely important.

Tennis courts and playgrounds can
usually be adequately dustproofed
with initial applications of one pound
of calcium chloride per square yard of
surface early in the season, and addi-
tional applications of one-half pound

 

per square yard of surface if and
when needed later.

For years calcium chloride has been
widely recognized as an effective dust
control medium by leading highway
institutions; the U. S. Lawn Tennis
Association recommends it for tennis
courts. Wherever gravel surfaces ex-
ist and might be a dust nuisance when
they dry out during summer months,
calcium chloride is a potential asset if
properly applied according to recom-
mended procedures.

 

A small spreader is being used to ap-
ply calcium chloride on a playground.

The Calcium Chloride Institute is
nationally recognized as the clearing
house for technical information on
calcium chloride and supplies, free of
charge, standard recommended proced-
ures for its many uses. It authorizes

and supervises continuing research on
the uses of the product in order to aid
users in obtaining best results.

From a bulletin for umpires distributed by the
Milwaukee Department of Municipal Recreation

AS A municipal athletic division official of the department
of municipal recreation you, the umpires, deal per-
sonally with people; thus, you are engaged in public rela-
tions work. It is the impression which you leave as a pub-
lic employee that raises or lowers the esteem in which the
municipal recreation department, particularly the munici-
pal athletic division, is held, in the minds of spectators and
those participating in the program. a
You have made application to umpire, and should be
aware of the fact that the minimum preparation for officiat-
ing in this capacity is a thorough knowledge of the rules
and regulations that govern play. It is imperative that you
be qualified, personally and professionally, in the strictest
terms.

Alertness, accuracy and impartiality are the indispen-
sable qualities of good officiating. The ofiicial’s conduct
before, during and after the game should be such that he
is in a position to sustain any challenge to his authority.
An even disposition is very desirable, for under no circum-
stances should an umpire lose his self-control—no matter
how trying the conditions. He should be as courteous as
possible in settling arguments. Remember, an official is
expected to be a gentleman at all times——on the field and
off the field.

Working a good ball game is not enough; you must fol-
low through with all instructions. If the municipal athletic
division is to give satisfactory service to the many teams,
participants, and general public, our records must be ac-
curate and up-to-date at all times. To accomplish this every
official must coopcrate. It is imperative that officials read
carefully all instructions, rules and regulations, bulletins
and schedules forwarded to them by the athletic division.

Special Reports:

a) A supply of special report forms is includcd in all of-
ficials’ kits. This form should be uscd for making all
spccial reports to the municipal athletic division, such as
complaints of other officials, players, managers, sponsors,
spectators, custodians, ball field attendants, condition of
diamond, general playing conditions, written agreements,
and so on. Constructive criticism will improve working
conditions for yourself and for your fellow-worker. Reduce
to a minimum all misunderstandings, infraction of rules,
unsportsmanlike conduct, and other incidents that might be
a detriment to the game, by reporting them in writing.
There should be no shielding of players, managers, of-
ficials, sponsors or anyone connected with the game.

5) All unusual or irregular incidents occurring before,
during, and after the game should be reported in writing

108

INSTRUCTIONS
TO UMPIRES

 

by the chief umpire working the game. Any official per-
sonally assaulted by players, managers, sponsors or spec-
tators is held responsible for filing his own report on such
conduct at once. The written report should be forwarded
to the municipal athletic division immediately on the special
report form. Under no circumstances should written re-
ports be made on the back of the game sign-up sheet or
score sheet.

c) In addition to forwarding the written report, it is neces-
sary for the official to telephone the municipal athletic di-
vision as soon as possible the following morning. The
telephone report is very important as it provides the di-
vision with information until the written report is received.

Watch: The chief urnpire’s watch is the official watch for
timing the game. Be sure to check your watch for accur-
acy before leaving home, then double check with officials

handling the game.

Sign-up Sheet: Officials cannot be too careful in the hand-
ling of the sign-up sheet. Have players of both teams
sign the sign-up sheet. Each player should sign personally
when he enters the game. If an ophcial scorer is assigned.
he will be responsible for this procedure. The base um-
pire should assist him.

Crace Period—Forfeits:

a) The head umpire will allow a five-minute gracc period
before forfeiting the game. This grace period is intended
only for teams unable to place a full team on the field at
scheduled game time. The appearing team must ask for the
forfeit. The umpire will then ordcr the appearing team
to take the field. The pitcher must throw the ball to the
catcher before the umpire can officially forfeit the game.

RECREATIOs

A team cannot be credited with a forfeited game unless a
minimum number of its players sign the sign-up sheet.
b) If the appearing team wishes to allow its opponents a
longer grace period, a written agreement, signed by the
appearing team’s manager must be turned over to the chief
umpire, who in turn forwards same to the municipal ath-
letic division with his other reports. (Special report form
should be used.)

c) If an extended grace period is agreed upon, it is the re-
sponsibility of the chief umpire to inform both managers
that the original deadline tcrmination of game time as
stated in the league rules shall be enforced.

d) In the event of a forfeit, the team taking the field will
not be required to use a new ball.

Custodians of Fields: These men have been instructed to
cooperatc to the fullest so that the officials, teams, and the
public are best served. Friction between officials and cus-
todians will not be tolerated.

Uniforms and Equipment: Wear the regulation uniform
and have thc propcr equipment. Look like an umpire, know
your rules, and you will be respected. When two umpires
arc assigned, it will bc the chief umpire’s duty to decide
what the proper uniform will be for both umpires in case
of hot wcather. The first named umpire on the assignment
sheet will act as chief umpire and call balls and strikes
'for second game of a double header. In the event of only
one gamc, the chief umpire is to call balls and strikes.

Reporting at Diamond: Allow plenty of time to get to the
field. Officials should be on the field at least fifteen min-
utcs before game time to supervise the necessary details in
connection with the game, sign-up sheet, and so on. lntro-
duce yourself to the custodian, team managers, and to your
fellow officials. ARRIVE EARLY ENOUGH TO:

(1) Locate the managers prior to game time and agrce on
special ground rules. (Both managers should be present at
such a conferencc.)

6) Inspect markings on playing field.

6) Confer with other game officials, custodian and ball
field attendant and playground director, if necessary.

During the Game:

a) Announce batteries in a loud and clear voice.

1)) Scc that substitutions are reported to scorer.

0) Listen to questions—not arguments—of captains and
managers.

(U Do not permit players to delay game by argument.

e) Stop game upon encroachment of crowd on playing
field.

f) Do not warn players of infractions. Call penalties im-
mediately--—balks, interference and the like.

g) During a game in which the scoreboard is not in opera-

tion, the umpire will announce the score at the end of each
inning.

General :

0) Appear in complete olficial’s uniform in neat and clean
condition.

MAY 1953

b) Take complcte control of the game and render prompt
decisions.

0) Refrain from over-zealousness and abusive use of au-
thority.

(1') Be completely equipped with mask, protector, broom
and indicator in good working condition.

e) Consult other umpires when in doubt on a decision.

f) Do not be guilty of criticizing or interfering with de-
cision of other umpires.

g) Endeavor to have teams hustle to positions between
innings.

h) Keep field and benches clear of anyone hut participants.
i) Do not fraternize with the players, managers, sponsors
or spectators before, during or after the game.

j) Do not at any time lay a hand upon, push, shove, strike
or threaten to strike a player, manager, sponsor or spec-
tator.

It) Do not be guilty of abusive verbal attack upon a player,
manager, sponsor, or spectator.

U Do not use profane, obscene or vulgar languagc in any
manner at any time.

m) Do not appcar upon the field in an intoxicated condi-
tion.

n) Do not gamble upon the outcome of any play or game.

A Day at Camp

For the past four years, the Omaha
Park and Recreation Commission has
been providing an outing program for
local children at an outlying park of
375 acres. The park is located close
enough to the city to make transporta-
tion a rather simple matter but also
far enough out to be removed complet-
ly from city life.

Starting in the middle of June and
continuing to mid-August, this pro-
gram provides local boys and girls
with the opportunity of spending a
full day enjoying nature at its best. A
bus, donated by the Federated Women’s
Clubs of Omaha, picks up the children
at their respective playgrounds at eight-
thirty in the morning and brings them
back at five-thirty. Twenty-three play-
grounds and other special groups are
represented in the attendance.

When the children, up to sixty in
number per day, arrive at the camp,
they are grouped into three Indian
tribes, the Sioux, Ponca, and Otoe,
classification being made on an age
basis. The children range from nine
through thirteen years of age. The
three camp counsellors act as chiefs for
the respective tribes and are assisted by
play leaders from the playgrounds—
usually two per day—scheduled.

In their nine hours at camp, the chil-
dren participate in a flag raising cere-
mony, learn Indian sign language, play
with and feed the many animals kept at
the camp; hike on the nature trails,
prepare and cook their own outdoor
meal, do crafts, enjoy a refreshing treat
of cold chocolate and then bring the
day to an end with a flag lowering cere-
mony. The favorite activities are the
hikes and the chance to play with the
animals.

Cost of this program is assumed
mainly by the park and recreation
commission but the children have been

110

contributing up to twenty-five cents
each if they are able. Service clubs
have given financial help, and so have
interested individuals.

In addition to the one day outing
program, two overnight outings are
held during the summer. Three camp-
ers per day, one from each tribe, are
selected on their campership qualities
to return for the overnights—-—which ex-
tend from Friday noon to Saturday
noon. Sleeping out under the stars,
around all night campfire, is an unfor-
gettable thrill.

The best evaluation of this outing
program is made by the children them-
selves when they ask, “When can we
come back?” Because of limitations of
funds and staff at the present time,
playgrounds have only two opportuni-
ties during each summer to let children
enjoy the outing program.——Milton Ha-

gen, Senior Recreation Supervisor, .

Omaha, Nebraska.

Something New In Oakland

“Covered wagon” days have been
conducted for young campers at the
Oakland Recreation Department’s Camp
Sierra for girls and Kamp Kidd for
boys, in the northern California Fea-
ther River region, according to Flor-
ence Birkhead of the recreation depart-
ment publicity staff.

Ten old wagon beds were converted
into exact replicas of the Donner Day
wagons. Five were placed at each camp
to supplement present facilities. Follow-
ing the urge to sleep out under the
stars, the wagons were provided—each
with four bunks—to serve like tents, be
dressing rooms and shelters in case of
bad weather.

In the belief that typical western
shelters would have great appeal, Bert
Trubody, the superintendent of con-
struction for the department, scouted
nearby areas in search of just the right

type of wagon bed.

Another housing innovation—tree
houses—has also been used at these
camps. The tree houses, ten feet off the
ground, each housed four campers.

Oakland recreation folks feel that by
offering young campers housing in a
tent one year, in a log cabin another.

a tree house for a third year, and a

covered wagon and perhaps a tepee or
other years, boys and girls will returr
again and again to camp knowing tha1
“something new” has been added.

Oakland boys and girls with phys
ical handicaps* will Spend ten days a1
Willowbrook Camp and have the samt
outdoor fun and pleasure other childrer
enjoy at camp. They will have the fur
of eating and “napping” under the
trees, fishing, exploring creeks and
trails, learning first hand about trees
Howers, birds and small creatures oi
the woods, acting in plays, folk danc
ing and making things from nature”:
materials.

Willowbrook Day Camp for Handi
capped Children is located in a we]
wooded and flat area in upper Teme
scal Regional Park. Operated by [hi
Oakland Recreation Department, thl
camp is a joint project of several agen
cies and groups—the Oakland Publit

Schools, Oakland New Century Club
Handicapped and Crippled Children’:
Guild, Oakland Kiwanis Club, Cerebra
_Palsy Children’s Society of the Eas
Bay, East Bay Regional Park District.

The camp is carefully planned to in
sure a happy, healthful and memorablt
experience for each child, explains Jaj
M. Ver Lee, superintendent of recrea
tion. A physician’s okay is necessarj
for each camper, and a personal inter
view with parents is required.‘ Spe
cial equipment for feeding, seating
and other services are necessary anc
each parent must place a blanket, pillow
and sweater in the transportation ca]
each morning. Three sessions of ter
weekdays each are scheduled. Trans

is by automobile.‘ The Monday througl

' RIVER CHLIJRINA’I‘IIJN

[*NTIL 1948, residents of Brattleboro, Vermont, who
l wished to go swimming during the summer months had
to content themselves with one of three locations: the highly
contaminated Connecticut River, the hardly-better West
River, or a lake twcnty miles away. The recreation depart-
mcnt for several years had been operating a swimming
program, on the West River, which was curtailed and
stopped many times because of the pollution of the water.
This procedure proved highly unsatisfactory. For instance,
the area was closed, because of pollution, half-way through
the 1947 season, during a severe heat wave. It is easily
seen that youngsters, parents and everyone alike suffered
during these periods. Something had to be donel

After considering this and
other similar experiences, the
rccreation board began to
search for an answer to the
problem of better swimming
facilities for Brattleboro. The
construction of a chlorinatcd
outdoor swimming pool was
considered seriously, but it
was decided that such a pool
would he too costly a venture
for the city. Other means
were sought to provide a safe
swimming area. It was brought
to the attention of the recrea-
tion department, hy an cngi-

neer whose children swam in

the polluted West River area, that a well known chlorinc cn-
gineering company might help in some way. Engineers of
this company came to Brattleboro to discuss the feasibility
of chlorinating one of sevcral proposed bathing areas. They
recommended, after an extensive survey, that the present
W’est River area would be most satisfactory, since the

natural flow of water might aid in the distribution of
chlorine.

was formerly superintendent of recreation in Brattleboro.

Plans were drawn up, diagrams made, and final details
drafted. It was decided to install the chlorinator and the
pumping device upstream from the swimming area, with a
pipe line extending directly into the stream, perpendicular
to the flow, from this apparatus. The swimming area is
one hundred sixty feet long, and extends one hundred feet
from shore to the farthest boom.

A vacuum chlorinator, with a capacity of two hundred
pounds of chlorine per day, was installed and connected to
a circulatory suction pump, with a capacity of four hundred
gallons of water per minute. One intake line furnishes
water to the pump, which in turn forces the chlorinated
water out into the main pipe line. This pipe line is one

hundred twenty feet long, made in twenty-foot sections,
and has diameters ranging from six inches to three inches.
At two-foot intervals along the entire line there are three-
eighth-inch holes, facing downstream, through which the
chlorinated water passes into the main strcam. An addi-
tional smaller pipe line was installed beneath the surface
of the beach, with connecting hose lines which furnish
chlorinated water to the crib area. It was found that am-
monia would greatly enhance the stabilization of the chlor-
ine residual, and thus a small ammonia pumping apparatus
was installed and connected to the main line. A solution of

RECREATIOD

llfate of ammonia and water is used in this operation. A
ghly stable chloramine residual is the result in the bath-
g area.

Total costs of this apparatus and its installation amount-
I to approximately three thousand dollars, a fraction of
.e amount necessary for a concrete or steel pool. Cost of
aeration, including maintenance, installation, storage, and
:lorine, amounts to about one hundred and thirty-five dol-
rs per week. Chlorine is purchased in one hundred and
lty pound pressure cylinders, and used in batteries of five
one time. The entire apparatus is installed each spring
1d removed for storage at the end of the swimming season.
his is necessary because of the possibility of the bathing
ea being inundated during a spring flood. This adds to
e cost of operation, but cannot be remedied at present.
1e apparatus can be operated easily by members of the
:ach staff, with the director in full charge. This saves the
st of a full-time man whose exclusive duties would be the
aeration and care of the chlorinating equipment.

To date, this installation has had four complete summers
operation. Small insufiiciencies have been ironed out in
is time, with the result that the equipment now operates
peak efficiency. The company regional engineer has been
.lled in for consultation on a number of occasions and has

been of incalculable value. This company has been very
generous and friendly in its connections with the Brattle-
boro Recreation Department, and without their sincere in-
terest in our problems, we would not have this installation.

In our opinion, which is backed up by full support of
the townspeople, this river chlorination “experiment” has
been a tremendous success. The area has been continually
certified safe for swimming by the Vermont State Health
Department. Daily residual tests are made, and several
water samples sent weekly for bacteriological examination.
We have found that by maintaining a specific residual or
chloramine in the area, the tests will consistently show a
safe count. At times, such as when the swimming load is
high, the flow of chlorine must be boosted so as to main-
tain the chloramine residual. So far, thc chlorinator has
never been taxed to capacity. The apparatus is in operation
ten hours daily for the entire season, and to date, after four
seasons, no appreciable loss of efficiency 'has becn noticed.
In addition, the area has never been closed, due to ma-
chinery breakdown, for longer than a half-day.

We in Brattleboro feel that we have profited highly, and
at little expcnse, by having had this experiment in stream
chlorination brought to our town. We hope that this infor-
mation may serve to aid other communities.

E NEED MORE TRAINING . . . We know how to do the
w job, but usually we don’t know why we do certain
things—or why some succeed and some fail . . . If rec-
reation is going to amount to anything in this province, it
must rest upon high standards of professional competence.”

That was how it all began. The municipal recreation di-
rectors of the Province of Ontario, some sixty in number.
were concerned about their own ability. They knew how
to be recreation directors, but their performances were not
based upon well-defined principles of disciplined and pur-
posive leadership. In addition, they all had experienced
some failures which they felt could have been successes with
more basic knowledge at their disposal.

In Ontario, the Community Programmes Branch of the
Provincial Department of Education is responsible for fos-
tering recreation programs in the municipalities through
a carefully designed and administered grant-in-aid system.
The branch functions through field representatives and ad-
visers, who serve the local areas upon request. Resource
materials are made available, the branch assists in train-
ing and offers a comprehensive advisory service. In some
areas of the province, three hundred or more miles sepa-
rate towns in which recreation programs operate.

Convinced that standards in recreation could not be
raised appreciably and in a reasonably short time without
training directors and working toward certification, John
Tett, the director of the branch, instituted a plan. What'
follows is not a success story but a progress report.

The first step was to determine what competencies recre-
ation directors needed. There had been many so-called lead-
ership training institutes, of many kinds, held previously.
Close examination revealed that they were primarily skills
training sessions, and that activity skills predominated.
Most directors had many recreational skills, but their jobs
had long since moved out of the direct leadership or coach-
ing categories. Even where the recreation director ran a
one-man office, the smallest part of his time was devoted to
skills leadership. The over-all program in the province
rests upon the community recreation philos0phy. As a re-
sult, the director is involved in the deve10pment of a com-
munity program.

The recreation directors, themselves, undertook to .assess
their needs for training. They were administrators, com-
munity organizers, governmental department heads, train—
ers of staff and volunteers; they ran offices, managed bud-
gets, and worked with boards and committees. They were
“experts” in recreation, who were looked to for philos0phy,
guidance, and community leadership.

Working together—directors and the Community Pro-
grammes Branch—a course director was engaged and a
three-year in-service training program was launched.

The course itself is divided into three parts. In Novem-
ber, all directors and full-time assistants come into Toronto
for a one-week institute. Emphasis during this week is

upon the-philosophy and underlying principles that gove
our work. It is the kick-off session for the year’s work
follow. The branch pays for the instructors and the me
ing space. In almost all instances local municipalities p
travel and living expenses of the directors.

Throughout the year the course instructors conduct fo
week-end institutes in each of five regions. These are W0]
shop sessions to which directors come from nearby tow1

The balance of the course is conducted through c<
respondence. One hundred and forty lcssons are mail
out, requiring outside reading and writing of papers 1
lated to practical work, which are returned to the com
director for his correction and comment. Comprehensi
examinations are given at the end of the year in five citi
simultaneously to accommodate all who have qualified l
virtue of completing the year’s work.

The course covers eight major subjects:

p—s

“The philosophy and principles of recreation.

2. Administration, with application to municipal recreation.

3. The mechanics of municipal government and the relationship
government to recreation.

4. Understanding people, personality, human relations, learning.

5. The sociology of the community and the community organizati
process.

6. The use of language in public speaking, making reports, a
discussion leadership.

7. Techniques in adult education, working with groups, committe:
visual aids and public relations. '

8. Facilities, lay out, maintenance, and planning.

The first five subjects were dealt with in part in this fit

It looks as though it has succeeded, but it is too early ft

of their real problems and have some basic principles I
apply to them. They are developing a new confidence i
themselves and in the recreation movement. They are plat

“On to Saskatoon”

Plans are well under way for the Eighth Annual Con-
vention of the Parks and Recreation Association of Can-
ada, which will be held from August 21 through Septem-
ber 3, and “On to Saskatoon” will be the byword. It is the
first time the convention has been further west than Win-
nepeg and those in charge of arrangements are going all
out to give delegates a real “western welcome.” Accord-
ing to L. A. Kreutzweiser, the secretary of the convention:
“Although this is a Canadian convention, it is stressed
that our friends in the United States will receive a most
cordial welcome.” All inquiries should be addressed to
him at City Hall, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

Charles 5. Lamb

A pioneer in the recreation movement, Charles S. Lamb,
who had completed thirty-three years of outstanding ser-
vice to the City of Los Angeles at the time of his retire-
ment in 1941, died at his Santa Barbara home on April 1.

Mr. Lamb entered the employ of the former Los Angeles
Playground and Recreation Department, the first separate
department of recreation to be established in the United
States, in 1908 as a “director-at-large.” In 1911, he was
named secretary to the Playground and Recreation Com-
mission, thus becoming the first man in the nation to hold
such a post. '

Oscar Holt

Oscar Holt, an exceptionally talented arts and crafts in-
structor in the Lewiston-Auburn area of Maine for many
years, died suddenly, in March, of a heart attack. He was
the author of the very practical article, “Substitutions in
Arts and Crafts,” which appeared in last month’s RECREA-
TION—an article which evinced his ability to improvise
and his symbolic expression, “It can be done.”

Pennell S. Eustis, the director of the Lewiston Recrea-
tion Department wrote that Oscar Holt’s philosophy of
life could be best summed up by “It is more blessed to
give than to receive.”

REMINISCENCES—

Father Link

#8 earliest memories went back to
the farm—the skunk killed in the
woodshed, the birth of a calf. His first
recollection of snow was when the horse
tipped over the buggy, which his
mother was driving. At nine he lived
in the Ozarks where his early acquaint-
ances were the crayfish and screech
owl. There was no one to help him
with his nature interests and he even
had a subconscious feeling that it was
not altogether right. He never con-
nected Dickens and Scott with the out-
doors. The only nature books available
were EurOpean. For this reason he
called the oriole a bullfinch. He kept
pigeons and rabbits, studying them by
the hour. Aquarium life, in square
candy ars, was of tremendous interest.
He knew the individual trick of each
animal. Still starved for nature books
he suddenly decided to keep a diary.
No one encouraged him, but he con-
sistently corrected and re-corrected his
writings.

One day Mr. O. D. Frank, professor
of nature education at the University
of Chicago, brought his class to Quincy,
Illinois. The professor pointed to the
hairy woodpecker, which happened to
be a downy. After class, the boy cor-
rected the professor. George Link had
never had a course in biology; how-
ever, his correcting the professor led to

tion. He is now devoting his time

an appointment as a biology teacher in
the Quincy High School.

Father Link next attended the Boy
Guidance Course at Notre Dame Uni-
Versity. This brought him into contact
with astronomers and botanists of na-
tional reputation. He was invited to
teach nature study at Notre Dame and
was soon advanced to co-director of
summer courses in boy guidance. In
the summer of 1932 Father Link at-
tended the Nature Guide School in
Hudson, Ohio. He was thc only gradu-
ate of the school who had never had a
course in biology before attending. At
the same time he knew more about
mushrooms and the psychology of birds,
and possibly other fields of biology,
than any other student. I vividly recall
the catbircl and the rose-breasted gros-
beak that he took on trips. When it
came time to pack up for the return
to the base camp, Father Link would
whistle the grosbeak out of the tree
t0ps. The bird landed on his finger to
be placed in thc cage for portage.

Father Link was a companion who

The design provides extra knee
room, and extra height between rows
for better visibility. The bleachers
have from four to twenty-four rows of
seats when extended, and when folded
against the wall, occupy space only
thirty inches deep. One person can
extend or fold a sixteen-foot bleacher
section quickly and easily, and floors
are protected from marring by a ply-
wood base on which the casters roll.
In closed position, the bleachers are
completely covered by smooth ply-
wood—no protrusions of any kind to
endanger play on the gym floor.

TIPS FROM OUR READERS
Multiple Use Flooring

Many recreation programs are sty-
mied when it comes to multiple use of
gymnasium floors, but the problem has
been solved in Wabash, Indiana at
Honeywell Memorial Community Cen-
ter. The solution? Masonite Preso-
wood—which is put down or taken up
as the occasion demands. P. G. Mag~
ner, Sr., manager of the Honeywell
center, decided to try it as a gymna-
sium floor covering, and the extremely
hard usage it has received has proven
its practicality. '

The floor in this center has been
used for roller skating, ballroom and
square dancing, large group meetings,
seating for stage, hobby, and gardcn
shows, farm exhbits, and many oth-
ers; even Gene Autry’s two horses
have been lead the length of it. Dur-
ing the summer months the covering
is left down and has been used for
badminton, volleyball, and boys just
wanting to shoot baskets.

For all practical purposes, the ma-
sonite pieces should be of the 4 by 12
feet by %-ln0h size, smooth on one
side and rough on the other. Before
laying, each piece is treated on both
sides with three coats of a clear floor
varnish with a bakelite and tung oil
base. A water-proofing of some sort
is_necessary because the masonite will

 

draw moisture from the air an:
buckle. Still further, this eliminate
cause for concern about any spille¢
liquids. Wood preservatives haw
been used successfully but are not a
satisfactory as the floor varnish fo

long wear.

 

The pieces are laid crosswise ove
most of the floor and can be put down
that way all over; but, for best ef

ficiency, pieces along the outsid.
should be laid lengthwise. After 3]
pieces are laid, masking tape, tw:
inches wide, is used for binding a]
seams and outside edges. (Taping i:
not necessary for meetings ant
shows.) 011 a floor which is to I):
left down for any length of time i

our size (50 by. 72 feet) require:
about one half hour. A half hour ma]
be allowed for four men to lay thI
floor, making a total time of one how

The first question usually asked is
that of expense. We cover and tap:
our floor for about $350, which in

Tricks in Decorating Your Gym
For a Prom*

Worrying about how to decorate
the gym for the prom? '-

Been wracking the committee’s re-
spective brains for some new and dif-
ferent ideas? Some inexpensive but
different motifs?

Bill Molyneux, a young scene de-
signer at NBC, a veteran at making
nothing look like something and a pro
at fixing up high school and college

gyms, passes along some of the tips
he’s discovered through eXperience.

One of the most important aspects
of decorating, he thinks, is to get a
committee chairman who’s really in-
terested. An art student is an ideal
recruit.

Next in importance is to concen-
trate the decorations so as to make
an effective “splash.” Instead of wor-
rying about fixing up every nook and
cranny he belicves in doing one big
thing. “If the area above the hand-
stand is decorated, imaginatively, for
instance, it will make the entire room
look good.”

Teeners make one mistake in hunt-
ing around for decorations. They try
to he too clever and make things hard
for themselves. He has a firm convic-
tion that the decorations committee
should try to duPlicate as closely as
possible the theme chosen for the
prom. “For instance, if the theme of
the prom is a spring frolic, the stu-
dents should try to work it out in-

stead of going into bizarre wonderful
effects.”

He planned decorations for one'
spring frolic this way: On the wall

the New York World-Telegram and Sun,
March 25, 1953.

behind the bandstand the committee
put up a black drape. Letters three
feet spelling FROLIC were
pinned on the curtain. On the letters
they pinned and stapled dogwood and
cherry blossoms. “So far this is pretty
routine,” he says, “so to jazz it up we
cut out cardboard lambs and pinned
them to the curtain so they seemcd to

high

he wandering from one letter to an-
other, eating the blossoms.”

The dance program repeated this
idea. It was shaped in the outline of a
lamb with a bow around its neck. Thc
bow fitted a girl’s wrist.

Another problem in gym decorating
involves color. Bill thinks it’s alright
to use color in combination but to use
only a few hues. Two colors are usu-
ally best.

To create an intimate atmosphere in
a big gym can be a headache, unless
you utilize spotlights. He likes col-
ored ones with revolving gelatins over

the light.

Fancy props are often overrated,
Bill has found. Made-over articles
from students’ attics can be more ef-
fective. He once discovered an old
tea cart, gilded it with paint and filled
thc top and shelf with artificial roses.
It gave the pretty look they needed
for a June dance.

“Incidentally, canvas local mer-
chants to see if you can borrow
props,” he advises. The roses men-
tioned above were loaned by a florist.
‘ “Thc main thing about decorating
is to keep it simple so the committee
doesn’t have to work all day and half
the night to put up the ornaments.”

Dog Training Clubs
The Chicago Park District Dog

Training Association assists new clubs

in getting started—there are now sev-
enteen dog training clubs meeting reg-
ularly in park fieldhouses——and con-
ducts city-wide affairs.

Each club has a director of train-
ing, who trains not the dogs but the
owners, who in turn train their own
dogs. Most clubs limit membership tc
recognized breeds; there are, however
three clubs, the Canine Pals, that take
in mixed breeds as well as pedigreed
animals. They meet on Saturdays ant
were organized as an activity for chil
dren from eight to eighteen.

Three degrees, as prescribed by th:
American Kennel Club, are used t<
designate the stage of training reachet
hy the dogs: CD stands for Compan
ion Dog (novice degree) ; CDX stand
for Companion. Dog Excellent; UI
means Utility Dog to which T is adder
after the dog has passed outdoo
tracking tests.

During National Dog Week—Sen
tember 20 to 26—the Association wil
sponsor a dog obedience demonstra
tion in which the various clubs wil
participate.

Dog College News, a quarterly bul
letin edited by a representative of th
Association and printed by the Chi
cago Park District, contains news 0
the various clubs and informativ
notes of value to members.

Booster Clubs

St. Paul, Minnesota, has eightee
adult Booster Clubs organized at th
playgrounds. The clubs sponsor atl
letic teams in municipal and inteJ
playground leagues, educational an
social events for children, city-wid
festivals, exhibits, and special event
and conduct regular business mee
ings and social activities each montl
A Playground Council, consisting (
six delegates from each Booster Clul
serves as a clearing house for activ
ties of these senior clubs.

Picnic kits containing balls an
bats, quoits, and a volleyball and n‘

tal fee of one dollar which is charge
for use of a kit takes care of replac

Aids for the Story Teller

FILMSTRIPS:

Old folk tales, legends and stories,
some with an international flavor,
have been beautifully adapted and ar-
ranged by Gertrude Jacobs for a new
series of filmstrips in excellent color.
The following, which have been re—
viewed by a NRA staff member, are
especially recommended:

Crachling Mountain and Peach Boy,
favorites of Japanese children; Mon-
key See—Monkey Do, from the Chin-
ese; Dancing Bread, an original story
by a nine-year-old; Alice in Wonder-
land, in which each frame is designed
to relate one of Alice’s adventures.
The filmstrips are available, with
study guides, from International Edu-

cation Materials Corporation, 625
Madison Avenue, New York 22, at
$4.00 each. They will be sent on a

ten-day approval basis for review.
(We would be interested in the ex-
periences of any of our readers who
are using filmstrips in their story-
telling programs.—-Ed.)

RECORDS:

Spaceship to Mars (Columbia,
MJV146, $1.05). Scientific facts, pre-
sented in a painless manner, and won-
drous sound effects make this trip with
Mr. I. Magination (Paul Tripp) in-
teresting to youngsters of eight and
nine years.

The Travels of Babar (CRG204,
$2.30). Excellent combination of the
tale of the lovable Babar with fine
music. Story and illustration appear
on the record’s wrapper.

Educational Television

Time is running out for those who
may wiSh to participate in, or benefit
from, programs which might be
broadcast over the 242 TV channels
which were reserved for nonprofit,
educational use. Although Education-
al Television Commissions in some
states have recommended petitioning
the Federal Communications Com-
mission for an extension, June 3 iS
the deadline for filing applications for
permanent allocation. After that date,

commercial interests may aSk the con
mission to remove the restriction:
Television channels are limited, an
when licenses have been granted fc
the permanent use of those whic
exist, there will be no more. The pro]
lems inherent in protecting the:
channels and using them for educ:
tional purposes—legislation, financin
for the building and Operation of T
stations, establishment of adequate no
work service, programing—have bee
under consideration on a national, sta'l
and local basis. A thorough knowledg
of these problems, as well as of the po:
sibilitieS and advantages which may l
realized from carefully planned, long
range programS, is desirable in enlis
ing the active support of the public an
interested organizations. It is believe
that the FCC will favor applicatior

American Nonsinging Games

Paul C. Brewster. University of
Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma.
Pp. 218. $3.75.

In planning the contents of this
book, the author states, “I have had
in mind its value to two quite dissimi-
lar groups: (1) teachers, playground
workers, and others who are ordinarily
interested in games solely for their
recreational and social value; and (2)
professional folklorists and serious stu-
dents interested in such matters as the
origin, diffusion, and life history of the
games.” Information on each game,
therefore, is divided into three parts:
text, comparative notes, and references
to further reading; and therein is the
book unique. Came descriptions are
clear, and unencumbered by footnotes,
thus adding to the practicality of the
volume as a work tool. They are
grouped according to the following
heads: “Guessing Games,” “Forfeit
Games,” “Hiding Games,” “Chasing
Games,” “Ball Games,” “Elimination
Games,” “Jumping and HOpping
Games,” “Practical Jokes,” “Paper and
Pencil Games,” “Games of Dexterity,”
“Courtship Games,” “Stick Games,”
“Games of Little Girls,” and “Miscel-

laneous Games.”

Recreation Leadership

H. Dan Corbin. Prentice-Hall, In-
corporated. New York 11. Pp. 465.
$6.65.

This new book by Dr. Corbin, Pro-
fessor of Physical Education and in
charge of recreation curriculum at
Lock Haven State College, Pennsylva-
nia, might better be called, “Recrea-
tion Activities and Their Leadership.”
Less than a tenth of the text is de-
voted to those subjects usually dis-
cussed in connection with recreation
leadership. One brief chapter covers
such subjects as recruitment and se-
lection, essential skills, in-service
training, institutes, training methods,

Covering the Leisure-time Field

1.

elements of a recreation curriculum,
field work, types of positions, volun-
teer leadership, principles in game
leading and so forth.

The great majority of the text cov-
ers program material in such areas as
arts and crafts, music, story telling,
social recreation, picnicking, hiking,
hosteling, “proven games,” swimming,
boating, and so forth. In order to
cover such a broad field some of the
chapters have had to be pretty well
condensed. The major areas of pro-
gram, however, have been given
rather substantial treatment. The
chapters on music, storytelling, social
recreation, games, and crafts are
naturally more comprehensive than
those on hobbies, toy and child play,
and hosteling.

One section of special interest deals
with audio-visual aids in the recrea-
tion program. This is one aspect of
recreation which has not been ade-
quately discussed in existing profes-
sional literature. Dr. Corbin describes
the various kinds of audio-visual aids
and gives some indication of how they
can be used. He also presents a very
valuable list of instruction films clas-
sified by activity and the sources
where they are available.

The chapter on safety, with particu-
lar emphasis on safety on the play-
ground, is welcome material and nec-
essary background for the beginning
recreation leader.

In attempting to provide in a single
work “all the essential aspects of rec-
reation leadership” it is possible that
Dr. Corbin has been too broad in his
handling of the program material or
too narrow in his discussions of ad-
ministration and organization. Al-
though he recognizes that recreation
activities are conducted by many dif-
ferent kinds of organizations such as
industry, unions, private agencies,
churches and hospitals, his adminis-
tration material is slanted exclusively
toward thc municipal recreation pro-

gram. His chapter on organizati
and administration, for instance,
based on a study done while he v
working for his doctorate at New Y:
University and covers primarily cit
of over 300,000 p0pulation with p
ticular reference to New York Ci
Again, the chapter on surveys dra
heavily upon his experience in c.
ducting a community-wide survey
the city of Lock Haven, Pennsylvar.

0n the other hand, the progr
material gets into the field of hos
ing, toys for children, and recreatio
and play therapy, subjects which i
of interest to the municipal recreati
leader, but hardly of much practi
value to him.

Since the book is essentially a t
for the recreation leader, it is reg]
able that special attention was 1
given to the variety of recreation le.
ership positions and the different te
niques and approaches needed. '1
handling of music, for instance, b}
playground leader in a public depz
ment may be different from the
proach used by a leader in a hospii
employee, church, instutional, or m
tary recreation program. Brief t
and suggestions on how to organ
and conduct the basic program ess
tials in some of these special sit
tions would have been most helpi

In any event, Dr. Corbin has 0
tributed some fresh life to a num]
of the activities he deals with a
has brought together in a single 1
ume most of the different types
program activities with which the r
reation leader will need to be famili

UCIIEN HIS BROTHER was killed in Korea,
Sergeant Rosser re-enlisted. Several months

later he, too, was in Korea—pinned down on
a hill near Pongil-li by surprise Red fire. He
saw it cutting up the platoon. Suddenly he
jumped to his feet, charged a Red bun'ker and
cleaned it out. In a trench he dispatched five
more enemies. Twice, under heavy fire, he re-
turned {01 more ammunition, then renewed
his attack. His furious one-man fight ended
with 13 enemy dead, the American platoon
saved, and a score settled for Sergeant Ronald

Rosser.

“When a man gets back from Korea,” says

Sergeant Rosser, “it does him good to see
people investing in our country’s Bonds.
Sure, Bonds are a practical way to save, I
know. But they also help build production
power—to equip and protect men overseas.
And that’s proof that people really care.”

Peace is for the strong! For peace and prosperity

save with U.S. Defense Bonds!

Now E Bonds pay 3%! Now, improved Serics E
Bonds start paying interest aftcr 6 months. And
average 3% intercst, compounded semiannually
when hcld to maturity! Also, all maturing E Bonds
automatically go on earning—at thc new rate—for
10 more years. Today, start investing in U.S. Series E
Defense Bonds through the Payroll Savings Plan.
