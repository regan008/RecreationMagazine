* In-Service Education for Communitg Center Leadership (225) . . . $ .35

Life, enthusiasm, skill, and understanding brought by recreation leaders to their daily work make
the community center a real asset to its neighborhood. Skilled use of every available means to improve
leadership is the responsibility of each recreation supervisor and executive. A good in-service educa-
tion program is essential. This book is a guide to such a program for all recreation leaders. It includes
material on philosophy and practice, procedures and methods, outlines of sample meetings, materials
and services for the program, and bibliography. _Prepared by Donald B. Dyer and staff of the Depart-
ment of Municipal Recreation and Adult Education, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the Committee on
In-Service Training of the National Advisory Committee on Recruitment, Training, and Placement of
Recreation Personnel.

* Plagground Leaders—Their Selection and Training . . . . $ .35

A practical guide for everyone concerned with better playground programs. Why are playgrounds
so important? Where do we find good leaders? How do we select them? Exactly what should be
covered in pre-service training courses? How can we judge whether leaders are doing a good job?
Answers to these and other questions are found in this book. Included are sections on: playground lead-
ership—what to look for and where to look; preparing a pre-service training program for playground
leaders; content of a pre-service training program; in-service training for better service. Prepared by
Raymond T. Forsberg, superintendent of recreation in Waterloo, Iowa, for the Committee on In-Service
Training of the National Advisory Committee on Recruitment, Training and Placement of Recreation

Personnel.

* Recreation as a Profession in the Southern Region . . . . $3.75

A report of the study by the National Recreation Association and the Southern Regional Education
Board. This l60-page book analyzes the full-time recreation leader and his employment in community
recreation departments, hospitals and correctional institutions, churches, camps, industry, voluntary
youth-serving agencies, professional education for the field, defense agencies, and state, regional and
national agencies giving special services in recreation. The volume reviews the present status as well as
the history of recreation leadership in the region, and forecasts a growth which will require two and
one-half times as many full-time recreation leaders as now are employed. Every recreation leader will
be interested in the major findings concerning needs for recruitment and for undergraduate and gradu-
ate professional education.

* Recreation for the Aging, hg Arthur Williams . . . . . $3.00

This segment of our population is all too often overlooked in planning the community recreation
program, and yet these people often need far more help than younger adults if they are to achieve a
rich, full life. This 192-page handbook will be of great value to any recreation director or civic group
interested in organizing and administering a recreation program for senior citizens. It includes chap-
ters on program and leadership, organization and finance, a wide variety of program activities, clubs
and centers, special groups and special agencies.

* Surfacing Plagground Areas (MP 219) . . . . . . $ .35

The question of long-lasting, economical and safe materials for playground surfacing is of continu-
ing interest to those charged with the responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of play-
grounds. This manual (a supplement to a committee report) is an account of experiments in a number
of cities in developing playground surfacing. It includes a discussion of cork-asphalt and rubberized

materials.

‘ First Choice of Over 80 Rinks and Clubs

 

CURLING is becoming an all-winter sport for clubs who are install-
ing CP ENGINEERED REFRIGERATION in their rinks. The Indian Hill

Country Club, Wilmette, Illinois, and the Maple Creek Curling
Club, Maple Creek, Sask., are two of 11 curling clubs that are get-
ting CP ENGINEERED REFRIGERATION this year.

 

HOCKEY games and practice sessions can be held as scheduled when
the rink is refrigerated by CP. One of the organizations that is get-
ting these advantages with a recently installed CP ENGINEERED
REFRIGERATION System, similar to this, is Middlebury College,
Middlebury, Vermont.

 

PUBLIC SKATING is attracting larger crowds than ever before.
Municipalities are installing CP refrigeratidn to meet the growing
demand for all-season ice. Recently, CP completed an outdoor
public skating rink for Jersey City, N. J.

for dependable, low
cost. ice-making

Thanks to CF refrigerated ice, Over 80 clubs and
rinks in the United States and Canada are en-
joying all-season curling, skating and hockey.
Schedules are free from the threat of cancellation
due to unseasonable weather; seasons are now
longer; more fun for participants and more profit-
able for clubs and rink owners.

The trend to GP ENGINEERED REFRIGERATION
is increasing. Some sixteen new rinks were re-

frigerated by GP in 1954 alone.

There are several good reasons why: CP takes
complete responsibility for the refrigeration job
——from planning to final inspection. With their
specialized experience in rink refrigeration, CP
engineers can bring you—as they have others——
a refrigeration system that operates at lowest
cost and gives years of dependable service.

ATION System would cost for your club or rink.

What’s in a Name?
Sirs:

The thoughtful article in June REC-
REA'I‘ION, “Naming the Recreation
Area,” leads me to take issue with the
standards set up for the Park Naming
Committee of the Chicago Park District,
with which organization I have worked
so long and pleasantly.

Why consider naming a park for any
individual only after he is deceased?
The recent action of park and recrea-
tion authorities in Fresno, California,
of procuring a new area and naming it
in honor of Raymond L. Quigley,
Fresno’s recently retired superintend-
ent of recreation after thirty-nine years

of outstanding civic contribution,
strikes me as fitting and proper.

Would not the naming of a suitable
Chicago area for V. K. Brown be in
order at this time? Why not let a man
enjoy appreciation for distinguished

'public service during his mature life?

We all want to keep out naming for
political purposes, but let’s give some
of our professional Titans credit while
they can still enjoy it.

C. 0. BROWN, President, American
Baseball Congress, Battle Creek,
Michigan.

Motto For Clowns
Sirs:

In the center spread, April 1955, with
the wonderful circus pictures, there was
a drawing of a clown near the bottom
of the sheet. With the clown was a bit
of clown philosophy that I liked very
much and which expresses what I try
to tell my cubs when they are putting
on their circus clown acts. It will make
a good motto to hang in the dressing
room so the youngsters can see it.

I would like you to know that I enjoy
and get a great deal of help from REC-
REATION. My only criticism is that I find
it difficult to channel the ideas where
they will do the most good. There are
so many of them it’s hard to keep track
of them. However, keep up the good
work. I can take it. I

Readers’ Response
Sirs:
We appreciated having your March
column, “Things You Should Know,”

announce our Annual Report. Perhaps
you’ll be interested in knowing that we

, have already, had a dozen or more re-

quests ouiside of Michigan for the re-
port and we are inclined to think your
announcement stimulated this interest.

tary, Inter-Agency Council for Rec-

RECREATION

Southern Regional Study

Sirs:

This is to let you know that I skim-
med through the new study, Recreation
as a Profession in the Southern Region,
and find it a good source book. The
summary and conclusions of each chap-
ter were particularly interesting to me.
I shall value it highly in my recreation
and college library.

'I' 'K' 'I' *

Sirs:

I have just received my copy Of the
book, Recreation as a Profession in the
Southern Region, and wish to tell you
what an excellent study of recreation
leadership and training needs is con-
tained in this book. The National Rec-
reation Association and the Southern
Regional Board of Education have pre-
sented a very comprehensive picture of
recreation in our southern states. The
book contains very valuable informa-
tion that will be beneficial to recreation
personnel working in our Southland. I
feel sure that every recreation adminis-
trator in the South will find this a very
helpful study which gives us valuable
information that will help to improve
our profession.

This has been a tremendous under-
taking and I want to congratulate the
members of the study committee, as
well as the National Recreation Asso-
ciation and the Southern Regional Edu-
cation Board, who have all done 3 won-

derful job in the publication of this
book.

OKA T. HESTER, Director, Parks and

Recreation Department, Greensboro,
North Carolina.

Synchronized Swimming
Sirs:

I enjoyed the articles on synchro-
nized swimming. We are ust beginning
our first synchronized swimming classes
to open up this activity for high school
boys and girls. We will organize the
program on about the same basis that
we did our high school corps in Tyler.
We now have about fifty potential syn-
chronized swimmers on our list. The

swimming articles are excellent. Keep
them coming!

ent, Topeka Recreation Commission,

Senior Citizens
Sirs:

I want to tell you how interesting and
helpful I found the articles on recrea-
tion for senior citizens in your February
1955 issue, which appeared ust in time
for our recreation conference at Santa

Cruz, so I was able to carry it along to
some of the discussions regarding rec-
reation for Older people. There were
many favorable comments concerning
the contents of the magazine.

Our-own senior citizen program is
continuing along in Berkeley and I am
more and more convinced in the poten-
tial abilities of Old peOple and how suc-
cessfully they conduct their own activi-
ties with proper guidance and super-
v1s10n.

I am a little concerned over the trend
that I observe in many communities to
provide primarily for the dancing Op-
portunities for old people and to neglect
the needs Of other older people who can-
not get out in the evenings or who do
not dance. Communities need to think
in terms Of a balanced program to serve
various needs of older peOple and to
provide staff leadership and facilities
at other than evening hours. ,

Another project that communities
need to consider may be the setting up
of counseling services to acquaint peo-
ple who are retiring and those with lei-
sure time with the opportunities offered
in a community for recreation service.

Recreation has certainly “come of
age” and RECREATION magazine is a
great help in keeping us informed.

EVERY thoughtful person recognizes
the importance of play in the life of
the growing girl and boy. Play in child-
hood assumes the place that work occu-
pies in adulthood. The world of the little
child is a make-believe world in which
imagination runs riot and activity is en-
joyed for its own sake.

The deeper significance of play in the
personality development of the child,
however, is not always readily appreci-
ated. A great many pe0ple recognize
that play is an indispensable activity of
childhood, but for most of them this in-
dispensability stems from the need to
keep the child OCCUpied and happy, and
is more of a convenience than a psy-
chological necessity for wholesome ad-
justment.

Far from being a luxury of childhood,
play is essential to personality growth.
Through play activities the child finds
opportunity for self-expression and self-
realization. Play provides a construc-
tive outlet for childhood energies. Play
cultivates social awareness, teaches im-
portant lessons in good behavior, pro-
motes physical well-being, encourages
qualities of leadership, facilitates men-
tal and emotional stability.

Although play is accepted as essen-
tial to childhood and is One of its most
dominant interests, it is necessary to
distinguish between play, which is
learned, and the love of play, which is
inherent and natural in the child. It is
true that some children do pass from
childhood to adulthood without ever
learning how to play because no one has
taken the time and trouble to help them
meet the need which the love of play
represents.

Such children almost always are un-

358.

Significance

of
PLAY

signor Nicholas H. Wegner, di-
rector of Father Flanagan’s
Boys’ Home in Nebraska.

happy in their association with other
children. They have a tendency to over-
assert themselves in their hunger for ac-
ceptance, and so lose popularity with
the group, or, out of fear of failure, they
assume an opposite attitude of uncoop-
erativeness, which is equally unpopular.

Fortunate is the child who comes
from a home where a happy medium is
preserved. He is neither neglected nor
is he coddled. He is not dismissed to
shift for himself as far as his play life
is concerned, and he is not bored to dis-
traction with more toys and playthings
than he needs. His situation is that of
the normal American child in the aver-
age American home.

Neglect and pampering are withering
influences as far as the play life of the
child is concerned. Both tend to en-
courage negative attitudes in the child.
Neglect may cause the child to avoid
others or to assume an overbearing
manner in an attempt to justify a shaky
confidence in himself. Pampering en-
courages selfishness and indifference to
the wants and needs of others.

The child who has not learned to play
becomes a social misfit. He cannot share
in the larger enjoyment of group parti-
cipation because he is unable to forget

‘ Editorial I

his own feelings and inadequacies. He
invariably assumes a pose of hard indif-
ference or false superiority. Outwardly
he may appear to be self-sufficient and
full of confidence, but inwardly he is
pained by a feeling of inferiority, fear,
and failure.

The motivations of play are deeply
imbedded in personality make-up. They
offer parents, teachers, and others alike
a wonderful advantage in training the
child for through the play interests of
the child, it is possible to instill and nur-
ture habits of thought and action which
are difficult to cultivate by precept
alone.

The fact that a person has never
learned to play does not mean that he
is therefore doomed to failure. He may
possess unusual talents and capacities.
What he has missed in not having
learned to play he may try to compen-
sate for by excelling in some particular
field of endeavor for which he is espe-
cially qualified. He may achieve con-
siderable success for himself. But never-
theless his chances for genuine happi-
ness are limited by his limited play
experience.

Man is a social as well as a physical
and spiritual being. As a social being
he has certain needs which have to be
met if he is to realize his fullest possibil-
ities. Play is a means by which social
needs can be met in the tender years of
childhood when character is being
formed. In teaching the child to play
you are at the same time teaching him
how to get along with others and how to
live with himself. 0

} THE REPORT OF AND PICTURES FROM
THE 37TH NATIONAL RECREATION CON-
GRESS, in session September 27 tO Oc-
tober 1, 1955, will be published in the
December issue Of RECREATION. This
issue will also carry the magazine’s An-
nual Index.

) OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOLS—CON-
SIDERATIONS IN PLANNING AND CON-
STRUCTION. Many will be glad to know
that the reprint of this series of articles
by George D. Butler is again available
——through a second printing. ($.75 per
copy, from the National Recreation As-
sociation). The first printing was im-
mediately exhausted. The articles, which
have attracted widespread attention,
first appeared in RECREATION magazine,

January, February, March, and April
1955 issues.

} ANNOUNCEMENT: The publication of
the article by Robert Sisco of Living-
ston, New Jersey, on school-community
cooperation, which was announced for
this issue of RECREATION, has had to be
postponed until November.

) DON’T FORGET TO ORDER your COpy

this year. Available mid-November,

$2.50 per copy.

) JUNE FOR A NATIONAL RECREATION
MONTH? The National Recreation As-
sociation has been asked to sponsor
such a month in the late spring or early
summer. What is your reaction to this
proposal? Would that be a good time
of year? Would your department as-
sist in the promotion Of such a month?

) GENERAL PUBLIC USE of recreation
opportunities afforded in reservoir areas
and other civil work projects of the
Corps Of Engineers increased thirty per
cent during 1954, according tO an an-
nouncement by the Department of the
Army. Attendance totaled 53,868,000
visitor-days, the highest on record, com-
pared with 41,301,000 in 1953, and 29,-
537,000 in 1952, according to Major
General S. D. Sturgis, Jr., chief Of engi-
neers. Recreation opportunities avail-
able at these projects include fishing,
hunting, boating, sailing, swimming,

360

picnieking, and camping.

The development, maintenance, and
operation Of these recreation areas, as
well as the included facilities and serv—
ices to meet the public needs, have been
shared by other federal, state, county,
and municipal agencies.

} ATTENTION, BOB MOSES IN NEW
YORK: Vienna, which has a population
of only 1,600,000, has twice as many
playgrounds as New York City and five
times as many municipal swimming
pools for children as New York City,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Boston,
and Denver combined—Quoted from
Danton Walker’s column, “Broadway,”
in the New York Daily News, August
4, 1955.

) PRESIDENT EISENHOWER has called a
special two-day conference Of eighty
representatives Of the sports, education,
and government field, in Denver—at
Lowry Air Force Base——-September 27
and 28. This is an outgrowth of his
concern regarding the physical fitness Of
American youth. (See “Editorially
Speaking,” page 361).

} PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY UNPRECE-
DENTED GROWTH OF POPULATION, which
gave the United States an estimated
168,000,000 people on January 1955,
were reSponsible for the National CItI-
zens Planning Conference, held in Wash-
ington last May, on “Parks and Open
Spaces for the American People.” Ac-
cording tO the Bureau Of Census, peo-
ple from growing urban areas have been
crowding into our national parks at the
rate Of 50,000,000 a year only to find
facilities designed a generation ago for
less than one-tenth of that number.
The meeting, called by the American
Planning and Civic Association, acting
with the American Institute Of Park Ex-
ecutives, the Council of Metropolitan
Regional Organizations, the National
Conference on State Parks, and the Na-
tional Recreation Association, was at-
tended by civic and professional lead-
ers, and by planning, park, and conser-
vation oflieials at each level of govern-
ment. Joseph Prendergast, executive di-
rector of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation, addressed a session of this con-
ference. For a digest of his significant

contribution, see page 372 of this issue
of RECREATION.

) DO YOU EVER HAVE A CLEVER PARTY?
RECREATION magazine would like to
carry more suggestions for parties, but
we want the stories to come from you,
based on actual experience. Will you
write us some _Of your good ideas, and
include “how-to-do” information?

) A PREVIEW of future construction po-
tentials with particular reference tO the
year 1955, appeared in the Architectur-
al Record for November 1954. It indi-
cated that the approximate amount of
social and recreation buildings con-
structed in 1954, based on an accurate
record for nine months and estimates
for the final three months, totaled 17,-
000,000 square feet. The estimated
amount of Space for social and recrea—
tion buildings to be constructed in 1955
is 18,000,000 square feet, or a six per
cent increase over 1954.

} REGIONAL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN AU-
THORIZED to approve development of
reclamation reservoir recreation areas
by state and local agencies, according to
an announcement by Secretary of In-
terior Douglas McKay. Such agree-
ments previously had had to be cleared
by the secretary. Regional directors of
the Bureau of Reclamation and of the
National Park Service now may negoti-
ate and Sign such agreements.

RECREATION

Editorially Speaking

 

United Nations Day

In the month of October, with the
many Observances of United Nations
Day throughout the nation (October
24), our thoughts turn especially to the
peoples of foreign lands. Accounts of
recreation in other countries are there-
fore interspersed with the other articles
in this issue of RECREATION.

The National Recreation Association
is a cooperating member of the United
States Committee for the United Na-
tions. Many organizations in connection
with the Tenth Anniversary of the
United Nations passed resolutions in
suPport 0f the objectives of the United
Nations. The National Recreation Asso-
ciation’s resolution, approved by the
executive committee, was as follows:

The National Recreation Association, dedi-
cated to the enrichment of life through rec-
reation and wise use of leisure, on this Tenth
Anniversary of the founding of the United
Nations, is happy to reaffirm its belief in the
purposes and objectives of the United Nations
to bring about a peaceful world.

No leisure can be fruitful, no recreation
joyous, in a world at war.

UNICEF Materials

Again this year, the United States
Committee for UNICEF is promoting a
“trick or treat” Halloween to collect
gifts for children in other lands (see
RECREATION, October 1954). For de-
tails, write to the committee at the
United Nations, New York, or send for:
UNICEF Halloween Planning Kit, avail-
able for one dollar.

Christmas greeting cards of children
around the world are on sale again this
year for the benefit of the United Na—
tions Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The
designs, a colorful series of five, which
were donated by the noted French illus-
trator, Edy Legrand, picture typical
schoolroom scenes in the Americas,
Arctic Circle, North African desert, and
the Orient. The cards come in boxes of
ten at one dollar per box, with a small
additional charge for imprinting if de—

sired. Address: UNICEF Greeting Card
Fund, United Nations, New York.

In addition, a single United Nations
card has been created by Uruguay-born
Antonio Frasconi, well-known woodcut
artist. He has surrounded a polar view

OCTOBER 1955

of the“ world with a colorful holiday
wreath of United Nations member flags,
symbolically uniting all people within
the United Nations. Available from
same address, one dollar per box of ten.

Physical Fitness of Youth

The concern of President Eisenhower
about the physical fitness of American
youth, which was the subject of an ar-

ticle, “The Report That Shocked'the
President” by Robert H. Boyle, in the
August 15, 1955 issue of Sports Illus-

trated, is being underscored again in a
special two-day conference called by the
President for September 27 and 28 at
Lowry Air Force Base in Denver.
Among those representing the recrea-
tion movement will be Joseph Prender-
gast, executive director of the National
Recreation Association, Mrs. Rollin
Brown, NRA board member and presi-
dent of the National Council of Parents
and Teachers, and George Hjelte, gen-
eral manager of the Los Angeles De-
partment of Recreation and Parks.

The conference is an outgrowth of the
President’s meeting with thirty sports
celebrities at an extraordinary White
House luncheon early this summer and
a subsequent luncheon meeting of Vice-
President Nixon with the U. S. Com-
missioner of Education, Dr. Samuel B.
Brownell, Senator Duff, and representa-
tives from the education and athletic
field. C. C. Johnson Spink, vice-presi-
dent of the Sporting Goods Dealer maga-
zine who was one of those invited by
Vice-President Nixon to the second
White House luncheon, reported that the
group is thinking of establishing a per-
manent organization for a youth fitness
program. The program would be aimed.
largely at rural areas, average or mid-
dle-income urban neighborhoods and
poorer over-crowded neighborhoods.

Sound advice from the professionals
on the problems raised by the President
and the national figures who have so far
discussed them will be available at the
National Recreation Congress in Den-
ver.
The Sports Illustrated article should
be “must” reading for every profes-
sional recreation worker.

Around the Worldl

B ELIEVING that in the use of leisure time there is more that

unites us than divides us, the National Recreation As-
sociation for many years has extended its services in re-
sponse to interested inquiries from beyond our national
borders. As Michael F airless has said, “The people who
make no roads are ruled out from intelligent participation in
the world’s brotherhood.” The National Recreation Asso-
ciation is engaged in making roads. Recognizing the vast
wealth of inherited culture brought from other lands to the
United States, it has never sought to impose any design upon
other peoples; but, rather, it has hoped to make ideas freely
available and to encourage a spirit of give-and-take. The
recreation of each nation is likely to be more effective if it
follows national traditions, exploring and expanding, taking
freely from experiences of others and finally achieving forms
rich in the culture of its people.

The Association believes firmly that human well-being
and happiness are promoted by wise use of leisure, that a
sane and brotherly way of life may grow out of well-used
recreation hours—recreation being a common denominator
for all peoples. If all persons are given opportunity to dis-
cover and satisfy their interests, talents, and skills in leisure
hours, and to share these, they will learn to live together and
the community he invigorated and refreshed; indeed, in the
end, the very existence of civilization may well depend upon
attitudes and understanding developed in this way.

Almost from the founding of the National Recreation
Association in 1906, tendrils of interest in play in other
lands has grown. Early play pageants, notably the “Pageant
of Nations” presented by the Pittsburgh Playground Asso-
ciation before the Third National Recreation Congress,
stressed folk dancing of the lands from which American set-
tlers had come. Before World War I, Mr. C. M. Goethe, of
Sacramento, California, then a member of the board of di-
rectors of the National Recreation Association, and Mrs.
Goethe, on a trip around the world helped to establish and
finance playgrounds in several countries in Asia. As early
as that, too, the Association assisted in establishing play-
grounds in Japan and in the Philippines. Since those early
days a steady stream of inquiries from other countries has
constantly opened new channels for service.

By 1932 it seemed that a recreation congress at which
workers from other countries could meet face to face would
be rewarding. And so it turned out. Delegates from forty
countries met in Los Angeles at the First International Rec-
reation Congress.

In the years since that meeting, recreation growth has
gone on all over the world. Even the tragic impact of war,
which in most cases delayed development, did serve to spread
the use of recreation literature, widely used by morale-
building officers everywhere. Also men and women with a
recreation background, finding themselves in the four cor-
ners of the earth, expressed themselves in games and clubs,

362

and song groups blossomed everywhere among civilians and
armed forces. -

In 1952 the National Recreation Association of the United
States was invited to send a representative to the National
Recreation Congress of Japan. A generous private gift made
it possible not only to send a delegation but to arrange the
route so that key cities around the world might be visited.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas E. Rivers visited twelve countries
briefly and spent six weeks in Japan where conferences with
public officials were held on all levels and with other civic,
social, and educational and religious leaders. (See RECREA-
TION, December, 1952; January and February, 1953.)

In the fall of 1952 an International Recreation Service
was officially established by the Association, with Mr. Rivers
as executive secretary. Thus, various activities were brought
together under a single leadership and a more intensive
effort to meet expanding needs developed. Headquarters
were opened in the beautiful new Carnegie Endowment In-

.ternational Center across the street from the United Nations.

Announcing the service, Joseph Prendergast, executive di-
rector of the Association said: “It is our hope that we who
know what recreation can do both for the individual and for
the community, will find a way, through the establishment
of this service, to bring together the recreation forces of the
world to promote a richer, more abundant life for all.”

The new service at present follows the methods which have
proved helpful in the past: correspondence, consultation,
and the dissemination of recreation literature. Orders for
literature come not only from the well-traveled countries of
Europe but from Namaqualand, South Africa, and from Jo-
hannesburg, Kimberley, Pretoria; a request for permission
to reprint from Southern Rhodesia; from Juneau and Sitka
in Alaska; from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; Hobart, Tasmania;
Linz, Austria; Agana, Guam; Na Erode, South India.

Among interesting letters of inquiry is the one from An-
chorage, Alaska, regarding methods of community appraisal
before expanding recreation offerings. Personnel inquiries
both from employer and employee have come from Alaska,
India, and South Africa. Advice is asked regarding work
among refugees in Austria; recreation plans in Colombo,
Ceylon, and in Egypt; hobbies in New South VV ales.

The far-flung subscription lists to RECREATION and the
Program Service give a quick and thrilling notion of world-
wide interest and activity. Nearly six hundred subscriptions
to RECREATION go to foreign countries. Some of these go
in bulk to A.P.O.’s, but subscribers are to be found in Leba-
non, Malaya, Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and other coun-
tries which sound exotic to American ears. In twenty-three
additional countries, individuals and organizations not
reached by RECREATION have availed themselves of other
publications of the Association.

The magazine, alert for material from or about recreation
in other countries, has within the last year published many

such items. And each year, in October, it carries—as in this
present issue—an international emphasis to synchronize
with the national observation of United Nations Day. One
recent item from Japan, for instance, states the interesting
fact that juvenile delinquency in Tokyo, a city of seven mil-
lion people, is at an all-time low as people flock to the play-
grounds which are staffed and equipped according to best
modern practices in Europe and America; another article
was a careful and helpful study of recreation planning in
Montevideo, Uruguay.

The Program Service, also initiated in 1952, now has one
hundred and forty subscriptions to Recreation Program
Aids going to foreign military bases via A.P.O. These vary
from single subscriptions sent in by individuals to bulk
orders, such as ten copies to the headquarters of the Eighth
Army and sixty to the headquarters of the Air Force Far
East. These publications are passed about again and again
so that their final reach is incalculable. Subscriptions to
Recreation Program Aids have also come from many far

countries—Arabia, Australia, Egypt, Norway and Vene-
zuela.

In addition to these subscriptions and requests for other
publications, a growing number of foreign memberships in
the National Recreation Association ‘now number well over

Australia; a leader of work for girls and women in Athens,
Greece, now providing leadership in paths of peace after-a
dangerous and patriotic career in wartime; the president of
the University of Hiroshima, on his way home from the
UNICEF meeting in Montevideo. The words of this leader,
who resigned from the J apariese Parliament to shoulder the
more difficult task: of building good will on the very site
where fell the atom bomb, will not soon be forgotten by
those of the International Recreation Service staff fortunate
enough to hear him speak. A talk with the chairman of the

unfolding achievement in that vast land.  representative of

thetic and from his own funds organized three camps for
boys and girls. A national recreation association has been
formed in that country.

Another visitor who was assisted in his planning was the
controller general of physical education and scouting in the
Ministry of Education in Egypt. He stated that he regarded
the public recreation program as the most significant thing
he had seen in America. Recreation as the message of the
American people to the troubled Middle East can build good
will in the hearts of residents of the area.

To the exhibition of children’s playgrounds staged by the
London and Greater London Playing Fields Association, the
International Recreation Service sent photographs and plans
of outstanding recreation developments in the United States.
It also distributed sports equipment and square dance rec-
ords, donated for the purpose by American firms, and pre-
sented sixteen sets of recreation literature to the State De-
partment of the United States to be sent to embassies or
other strategic places where recreation interest has been
found.

The International Recreation Service is not a one-way
street. The How of ideas, information, and inspiration is
in all directions. Literature, magazines, bulletins, and books
in many languages find their way to the International Rec-
reation Service library as courtesy contributions to the
world pool of recreation information from which all nations
may draw.

At the National Recreation Congress in St. Louis last year
the foreign representatives were Dr. Soichi Saito, president
of the National Recreation Association of Japan, who de-
livered an address; Cenzaburo Shirayama, former Olympic
swimming champion, now president of Kanto-Gakuin Uni-
versity, who gave a swimming exhibition; and Fred Krues-

mann of Wilhelmshaven and Dr. Heinz Wunderlich of WO-

tho, Germany.

In England, adventure playgrounds like this one in Clydesdale
Road, London, are just getting under way. They are being
started with the conception of “transmuting destruction and
vandalism into creative effort,” and fostering team spirit.

  
 
 

At the meeting of the National Advisory Committee for
the International Recreation Service held during the con-

gress, reports were heard from the local workers who had
helped to show the scope of the recreation program to for-
eign visitors. No praise could be too high for the local rec-
reation people who, in their busy lives, have found time to
welcome, and serve foreign visitors. Reports were heard,
among others, from executives of Denver, San Francisco,
and Dearborn, Michigan. Dr. Harold D. Meyer, vice-chair-
man of the advisory committee, reported on his work with
the International Labor Ofiice and said he had suggested
that the next I.L.O. meeting be held in connection with the
International Recreation Congress planned for 1956. Henry
D. Schubert of Dearborn reported special music scholar-
ships which will enable selected German youths to attend
the National Music Camp in Michigan.

One of the difficulties faced by the service is a difference
in the use of words; that is, in other lands recreation activi-
ties are likely to be found grouped with other services unre-
lated to the concept of recreation usually accepted in the
United States. This situation has resulted in some slowness
in routing foreign visitors into the areas in which they are
most interested. The executive secretary of the International
Recreation Service has been in touch with the State Depart-
ment in an effort to assist exchange persons primarily inter-
ested in recreation to spend the major portion of their time
in the United States visiting recreation systems.

And now, as has been announced, the recreation workers
of the world will once again be gathering in Philadelphia for
another International Recreation Congress. There, from
September 30 to October 5, 1956, leaders who share this
dream of life enrichment through recreation will meet in
person to plan for the future. As Carl Sandburg has said:

“Man is a long time coming,
Man will yet win.
This old anvil laughs at many broken hammers.

Nothing happens unless first a dream."
The recreation forces of the world have the dream, and are

at work building it into reality. 0

Observations

0n Recreation and Parks
in England and Scotland

Weaver W. Pangburn

AESTHETIC FEELING reinforced by social control is more
advanced in England and Scotland than in the United
States. Evidences are the attention to floriculture given not
only in public and private parks and large estates, but also
on downtown commercial buildings, in the yards of the
humblest homes, in islands in otherwise dreary streets, in
drab industrial towns, and in housing developments. The
American driving through the English and Scottish country-
side is struck by the absence of disfiguring billboards and
other ugly advertising. Five years ago Parliament passed a
law forbidding such roadside advertising.

Concern for the “amenities,” as the British call them, is
further seen in the careful screening—with trees and shrub-
bery—of highway trailer, or “caravan,” parking areas.

In the large parks of London and in the commons of towns
and villages, as well as in municipal and “private” school
playing fields, is seen a steadfast adherence to the idea of
bringing the country into the city. Great meadows cropped
by sheep are a feature of Kensington Gardens. Playing fields
more closely resemble pastures than American playfields.

The tourist, visiting town after town, learns that virtually
all have commons, parks, or playing fields. In England,
cricket pitches are as common as softball and baseball dia-
monds in the United States, and English lads grow up with
cricket as naturally as American boys with baseball. Foot-
ball (soccer) fields are general throughout England and
Scotland. Few cricket pitches are seen in Scotland except in
Edinburgh and a few other towns. Everywhere in the Scot-
tish towns and villages are golf courses or, at least, putting
greens and lawn bowling greens. In Scotland, ladies and
the young people as well as elderly men bowl.

The banks of the Thames and other rivers generally have
been preserved for public recreation use. Some of the most
beautiful scenes in Great Britain are found in the unspoiled
parks, playing fields, and public meadows at riversides such
as those at Windsor and Pangbourne.

It is surprising to learn that in a country as congested as
this, and one not able to raise more than one-half the food-
stuff it requires, there are now one and one-half acres of
public playfield space to every one thousand people and that

MR. PANGBURN, a former National Recreation Association
staff member, visited a number of European countries last
summer and conferred with park and recreation leaders.

OCToBER 1955

the National Playing Fields Association, after a recent in-
quiry among public authorities, has reaffirmed its standard
of six acres to every thousand peOple. Thirty-nine per cent
of Scottish communities have attained the latter standard.
English standards exclude the additional school playfields.

In London and Edinburgh, in addition to the famous large
public parks and squares, are numerous small private neigh-
borhood parks, like Gramercy in New York City. They are
known as gardens, are beautifully maintained, and are re-
stricted to relaxation for neighborhood residents only.

In public housing projects, despite the need for a maxi-
mum amount of agricultural land throughout the British
Isles, the government has managed to be far more generous

in public recreation space than rich Uncle Sam in his public
dwelling program.

The layouts for games and sports in the playing fields
reveal fewer numbers of courts, areas, and facilities and
less variety than are common in the United States. Thus
one sees few volleyball, paddle tennis, basketball, and bad-
minton courts. ShufHeboard is not evident. However, most
parks and playing fields have their “corners” for play ap-
paratus. Some of the apparatus is very old fashioned, espe-
cially in London. The more highly developed playing fields
include practice cricket pitches in wire enclosures and even
circular, hard-surfaced dromes for bicycle racing.

of American practice in public recreation in several re-

and bridle trails, our British cousins have not made the
progress evident in the United States in reconciling a high
degree of the aesthetic with extensive development of areas
and facilities for active use in the same park properties.
Further, the park-school concept gaining wholesome head-

Great Britain. Cooperation between educational and park
authorities is in an elementary stage only.

National agencies concerned with recreation do excellent

work but operate largely in quite specialized and unrelated
ways. Thus the National Playing Fields Associationconfines

its tasks to securing playing fields. The Central Council
of Physical Recreation is concerned with promoting activi-

ties and providing instruction for them. The Institute of
Park Administration sticks to parks.

However, the major difference between public recreation
in the United States and that in Great Britain is the latter’s
lack of the trained, professional administrative and leader-

ship personnel for community recreation which is the dis-
tinctive contribution of the United States.

The British have avoided the commercialism and the pro-
fessionalism which unfortunately have invaded the public
recreation field to a marked degree in the United States
in recent years. The great crowds at football games played
by professionals in England and Scotland notwithstanding,
athletics in the British Isles still belong largely to amateurs.

After a look at recreation “over there,” the American
may be inclined to ask himself, “In our eagerness for par-
ticipation applied through an increasing variety of gadgets
and pressures, are we overdoing promotion?”

Widespread and consistent sense of beauty, simplicity,
and amateurism, to sum it up in a few words, seem to be what
the English and the Scots have to say to us about public
recreation. O

Let’s Bring Back Soccer

There has been a steady dr0p of play-
ers and teams participating in the Na-
tional Soccer League consisting of adult
teams from around the metropolitan
Washington, D. C., area. Why this de-
cline? What can be done to bring back
this world sport?

First, we realize that there has been
a great deal of stress put on our na-
tional sports of football, basketball, and
baseball, while soccer, which in the past
was a popular community sport, seems
to have been pushed to the side lines. An-
other factor in its decline is the difficulty
of obtaining players for these teams.

Soccer is the national sport in almost
every other country in the world. With
the pressing necessity of our being
united with all countries and of inte-
grating our continually'rising foreign
population into our way of life, this in-
ternational game can prove an impor-
tant factor for a healthy, everlasting
friendship. Opportunity should be made
available to these people from other
lands as well as to the boys who are
being taught soccer in our secondary
school programs—for participation in
this sport on a competitive basis during
their leisure hours.

Our department in Prince Georges
County, Maryland, and the Montgomery
County Recreation Department, in co-
0peration with the Old Timers Soccer
Association of metropolitan Washing-
ton, have organized a junior and senior
bi-county soccer league for boys nine-
teen years of age and under. The games
are played on fields belonging to the
board of education and the Maryland-

game, these three groups have spon-
sored a clinic to give coaches and play-

learn more about the game. This has
been conducted by Edward Rieder, soc-
cer coach of Montgomery Blair High
School, who does an excellent ob of dis-
cussing the scope and play of soccer.

Soccer in Hamilton, Ontario

A group of men interested in minor
soccer decided to introduce this game
to the youth of the city of Hamilton

The Sport
of Nations

about four years ago, according to an
article by Wilfred Thomas, vice-chair-
man of the Hamilton Recreation Asso-
ciation, in the Community Courier of
Ontario, Canada, October 1954. Some
tentative feelers were put to members
of the school board, but results were not
encouraging. It was, therefore, decided
to try another approach through the rec~ I
reation department. The director of
recreation, Anthony G. Ley, stated that
the following two principles were the
basis of a successful plan :

1. Stress the development of the aver-
age player not the star. To do this, get
a representative in each community
council, preferably some person whom
you know has a soccer background. It
would be this person’s task to gather,
coach, and run a team or teams in his

area.

2. Insist upon high ethical standards,
particularly with respect to the players’
and coaches’ attitude toward the ref-
eree’s decisions.

The latter favorable attitude from a
representative of the city was ust what
was needed to give the necessary im-
petus to this sport.

During the first season eight teams
between the ages of ten and fourteen
years finished the season. In 1953
twenty-two minor teams and six juve-
nile teams enjoyed a successful season.
The season which has just passed has
shown a further increase: twenty-eight
minor teams, nine juveniles, and thir-

teen cherub teams.
In three years Hamilton has risen

from nothing to first position in minor
soccer in Canada. 0

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, city—wide Halloween
cooperation routs the boogey-man vandalism.

THE goblins may walk and the witches
may ride their brooms on Hallow-
een, but in Fort Wayne they have been
taught to go about their business with-
out local damage. In this northeastern
Indiana city of 140,000, the new gen-
eration of youngsters has never partici-
pated in some of the rougher aspects of
this ancient festival. This strange set
of circumstances has been achieved by
community effort and support.

Prior to World War II, a committee
from a local civic club got together with
the park board staff and decided to have
a large, downtown Halloween party for
all the youngsters who would come.
This plan was carried out yearly until
it was found that a great deal of trouble
was caused by having the young people
come so far. In order to relieve the bore-
dom of the long journey, their search
for extracurricular activity on the way
was often of a disturbing nature.

In 1945 the one party was broken
down to five district parties, each put on
by one of the civic clubs or fraternal
organizations which furnished prizes,
refreshments, and part of the personnel.
Here again, there we're several prob-

lems. The age-range of the participants
was so broad that no one program could
be planned to entertain the entire group.
There was still a considerable distance
for some of the youngsters to travel;
and, most important, the sponsoring
groups were soon trying to out-do one
another in the way of prizes. If Johnny
heard that the party nearest him was
giving away roller skates and that the
one across town was giving away bi-
cycles, Johnny was very apt to travel
across town. The matter was right back
where it had begun many years before.

Finally, in 1947, the park board and
the Fort Wayne Council of Parent-
Teacher Associations met to try to solve
these problems. It was then that the
framework within which Halloween is
now celebrated was first outlined. It was
felt that there should be as many parties
as possible and that they should be held
in the public schools, which were well
located. The need for more than one
type of activity, to correspond with the
various age-ranges that needed to be
reached, was evident. It was decided
that all prizes and refreshments should
be uniform throughout the city and that
the affairs would be co-sponsored by the
parent-teacher groups and the park
board, with each organizatiOn taking
care of the details it could best and most

easily do. Permission to use the school
buildings was granted and the program
was under way.

These parties have drawn over 15,000
youngsters in some years, and each Oc-
tober there are close to 1,000 adults do-
ing the work that makes the whole affair
possible. In 1953 twenty-four separate
parties were put on by the central Hal-
loween committee. Most of these were
held in public schools. Three were in
city owned community centers, two in
park pavilions, and one was a joint op-
eration of two neighboring private-
agency community centers.

In last year’s program, each of nine-
teen grade school parties started with
a costume parade around their immedi-
ate neighborhood. Routes were well
publicized, and each parade was led by
a fire truck or a police car. Every effort
was made to avoid busy streets, but
where this was impossible every precau-
tion was taken for the safety of the chil-
dren. Red flares helped guard the more
dangerous of routes. In one case barri-
cades were used to block the street dur-
ing the parade.

Each parade terminated at the party
location, where costumes were judged
in thirteen categories. Judges were
urged to pay particular attention to
those costumes that took some imagina-
tion and, where possible, to award
prizes for those that were made at home.
The designing and making of these cos-
tumes became a fine family project.
Prizes for costume winners for the past
several years have been hats—usually
orange and black crew hats obtained in
quantity at a reasonable price.

After the judging any number of ac-
tivities took place. At some parties the
school halls were lined with games of
the carnival type—-——clothes-pin in the
milk-bottle, blow the cone, ring the
chair leg with the jar rubber. A large
list of these had been made out with par-

ticular attention given to making prop-
erties easily accessible. Others presented
talent shows. Magicians were popular,
and at some few parties it was felt that
movies were the best way to hold the
attention of as many as a thousand
squirming grade-schoolers.

These events were held from 7:00 to
9:00 P.M. The committees were asked
to work within that time schedule as

RECREATION

closely as possible. But even after these
grade-school youngsters were at home,
shortly after nine o’clock, tired and
happy, the party wasn’t over for them.
There was still the radio program, tried
for the first time this past year.

Prior to the night of the party, printed
slips of paper were passed out to each
grade-school youngster in the city
through the public and parochial
schools, to be filled in with name, ad-
dress, school, and telephone number at
which he could be reached. These were
turned in at the party. At 9:15 P.M. on
Halloween a broadcast began over one
of the local stations. Telephone calls
were made from a “drawing” of these
slips at the radio studio, by a committee
member. If the child was at home and
took the call, he received a pass ad-
mitting four people to the professional
basketball game on the following night.
The tickets were donated by the spon—
sors of the local team in the National
Basketball Association.

The radio program had the effect of
getting the children to the parties so
that they could deposit their slips, and
of getting them home quickly after-
wards. Committee members stayed at
the radio studio until someone from
their party had won the passes, and then
delivered them within ten minutes.
About twenty calls were made in that
hour broadcast. Only one child was not
at home, and she had just gone some—
where with her father. This additional
gimmick was deemed a success.

Two square dances were held for
youngsters in the seventh and eighth
grades in two of our largest park pavil-
ions at opposite ends of the city. There
are eight junior high schools, and they
were divided—four to each location.

In this case, the affairs began at 7:30
and continued until 10 :00 RM. A sched-
ule of the times that buses were to be
at each school was published in the
newspapers, and many took advantage
of the bus transportation. Several adults
were on each bus and the revelers re-
turned to the schools in the same way.

These were not masquerades, because
this particular age group isn’t quite so
enthusiastic about dressing up as are
the younger children. The dances were
called by a professional square dance
caller who was backed up by a union
dance band. Light refreshments were
served, and the intermissions were de-
voted to games. Here again, leadership
was furnished by the parent-teacher as-
sociations.

This junior-high phase of the over—
all program is growing in direct rela-
tion to the interest in square dancing as
it is taught by the schools and various
other local organizations. It is the new-
est part of the entire program and may
well be the most successful in a few
years. ,

Finally, the high school students
came in for their share of the big cele-
bration, with three regular dances, one
at each of the high schools serving the
north and south side of our city, and the
third at one of the park board recrea—
tion centers on the east side of town.
None seemed needed at the downtown
high school.

The program for these was simply
dancing, as high schoolers like to attend
dances, and to partake of the free cokes
and potato chips which are served to

them throughout the evening. Again,
the P.T.A. members did the work well.

In addition to those already men—
tioned, the number of other people and

organizations cooperating in this effort
is a large one. Police department men
attending each party had as much fun
participating in the evening’s activities
as did the youngsters. Our city light
company spent many dollars and more
man-hours erecting special lights on
school grounds and around buildings.
First aid personnel and equipment were
placed at each party location by the
local chapter of the American Red
Cross, but they seldom had anything
to do. Five dance bands were furnished
free by the local union of the American
Federation of Musicians, the men being
paid through the record fund of that
union, and a nation-wide grocery chain
contributed an immense number of ap—
ples. All the items that were purchased
were brought at large discounts. The re-
tail merchants division of the chamber
of commerce helped in raising the
money that was needed to pay these
bills. This list could go on and on, but
these few suliice to show the excellent
community spirit in regard to this
project.

All problems connected with our Hal-
loween have not been solved, but it can
be said that this is a program that has
received public acceptance, and that is
expected to go off smoothly each year.
New ideas will come along and this out-
line will be changed if only to get away
from too regular a course. Before the
parties were organized, damage
amounted to several thousands of dol—
lars each year. The police department
now tells us that they have come to ex-
pect Halloween to be routine — little
different from hundreds of other nights
in the course of a year. Such a result
is possible only where cooperation is
basic and unquestioned. 0

Each parade is led by a fire truck, as below, or a police car. Busy streets are avoided, red flares guard the routes.

IN OTHER LANDS

Potato Peel Playground

Students of Thedestrasse high school
in Hamburg, Germany, solved the prob-
lem of a playground of their own by
earning the money by collecting potato
peels from city homes and restaurants
and selling them to local farmers for

hog feed. The farmers pay 2.20 Deu-
tsche marks (52 cents) for each 110
pounds of peels. Their successful sales-
manship enabled the students to make
the down payment (11,000 Deutsche
marks) on an old German castle with a
park and pond for their “place to play.”

the Erlenhof Youth Center, conceived
the plan for an area to include, as play
structures, a large U-shaped “mountain”
and three smaller mountains—with val-
leys to match—two commodious and
well-ventilated caves, one long drainage-
pipe tunnel through a mountain, and a
waterfall, bridge, and wading pool. A
volunteer work camp, the youth center,
neighborhood children,‘ U. S. Army En-
gineers and so on, cooperated in the
building program.

Because German children admire the
American Indian and his mode of life,
a replica of an Indian council house will
be added later. This will be used for
rainy-day activities and “tribe” coun-
cils. Mr. Steenwyck says: “This project
not only represents a great deal of in-
spired hard work, but it refiects a belief
that the re-education and improve-
ment of Germany is best accomplished
through its children and that an attrac-
tive place for healthy, spontaneous play
will have a constructive effect upon
many generations of neighborhood chil-
dren.”

Employee Recreation in Japan

Employees of the main office of the
Japanese National Railways in Tokyo
watch a weekly noon-hour newsreel,
shown by the recreation branch of the
railroad’s welfare department. Through
a special arrangement, two leading news-
papers compile and edit the films, and
all the employees—-from the president
down to the cleaning women—are able
to enjoy ultra-current newsreels before
they are shown in the theatres.

Stadium for Moscow

The largest sports stadium in the So-

cow. It will seat 100,000 and is expected
to be completed by the summer of 1956
in time for the Soviet pre-Olympic
Games competition. A swimming pool
with seats for 12,000 spectators, a field
for “hand” sports with 15,000 seats,
eight football practice fields, thirty ten-
nis courts, twenty volleyball and twenty
basketball courts are included in the
plans for the area. An enclosed sports

Artmobile Opens for State Fair

Theufirst unit in New York State’s
pioneering program to provide museum-
on-wheels service for all interested
schools and communities opened during
the State Fair in Syracuse in September.
Artmobile, incorporated under the New
York State Board of Regents as a non-
profit, educational institution, depends
completely upon the belief and support
of people who feel that educational and
cultural opportunities can "be greatly
extended through use of mobile units.
All work has been done by volunteers,
working as individuals or through their
chosen organizations, to establish a serv-
ice closely linked to the needs and in-
terests of schools and communities to
be served. All interested in further in-
formation may write to Artmobile, lnc.,

Publicity’s Cookin’
What’s Cookin’, the publication of

the Recreation and Park Commission,
East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, in
a recent issue gave these interesting fig-
ures: “The Special Services Department,
directed by Virginia Brueck, recently
disclosed that news coverage for the
commission during the month of July
consisted of 188 news articles used by
the newspapers, with 34 of these be-
ing pictures, which is an average of
over one picture a day for the month.

The total news coverage for the year so,

far is 890 articles.”

Memorial Dance Festival

A country dance festival in memory
of the late Professor Lawrence V. Loy
of the University of Massachusetts was
held this past summer at the university
athletic field in Amherst. Professor Loy,
who died last March (see RECREATION,
April, 1955), was a nationally famous
exponent of dance festivals. Ten years
ago, he originated the annual festivals
which attracted more than twelve hun-
dred couples to Amherst. Proceeds from
the 1955 festival were contributed to the
Loy Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Prior Planning for Park Pays

The following statement by Edwin L.
Haislet, president of the Minneapolis
Board of Park Commissioners, in an an-
nual report, points up the wisdom of
obtaining park property whenever pos-
sible: “Principally responsible for the
high degree of park development in
Minneapolis are the early members of
the board who, in their wisdom, ac-
quired prOperty for park purposes long
before such development was financially
possible. In this policy lay the secret

of their genius, for today it is an axiom
of park work that park areas must be
acquired long before the need for them
is demonstrated, or the needed land will
have been devoted to other uses or the
cost of acquisition will be prohibitive.”

ARKS AND OPEN SPACES mean a great deal to the American
people, perhaps more than to any other people in the
world, because parks, in the modern sense of the word, and
open spaces, in both the modern and the traditional sense,
have contributed, and can continue to contribute, much to
the very essence of the American Way of life.

The physical wealth, emotional strength, and the great
democratic spirit characteristic of America have been
shaped and formed under the pressure of an abundance of
open space. First, it was an unknown and empty continent
which faced the restless, adventuresome men who eXplored
the coast of the New World. As more and more sailing ships
brought colonists fleeing from the crowded areas of Europe,
the wide Appalachian Mountains Were crossed and the heart
of the continent penetrated by men and women seeking free-
dom and opportunity.

Every child in America knows about Davy Crockett and
that amazing group of frontiersmen who until the late nine-
teenth century were continually on the move for new “open
space”— virgin land on which to hunt, search for wealth, and
linally to settle and raise families.

B. A. Botkin in his Treasury of American Folklore de-
scribes these people in this way: “In endless brags and gags,
tall talk and tall tales, heroic myths and sagas, blues and hal-
lads, they express the boundless optimism and the ‘indi-

vidual competitive aggressiveness’ of a restless, ingenious,
wisecracking folk with one foot in the road, who still believe
in miracles and in greener fields across the next river or
mountain, in the next county or state.”

It is worth noting that the inscription on the California
State Capitol reads, “Bring me men to match my mountains.”

The folklore, the tradition, and the fact of the American
wilderness, frontier, and open space have had an enormous
influence on the American character. Although the frontier
had disappeared by the 1890’s the spirit of democracy and
the individual initiative literally forced upon the American
people by boundless open space continued to flourish. Ameri-
can business, government, industry, and education received
their greatest stimulation from the concept of America as
the land of Opportunity. And the land of opportunity basic-
ally meant an endless stretch of open space where a man
could achieve individual success and happiness.

With the closing of the frontier certain American civic
leaders, more sensitive, perhaps, than others to the special
American need for Open spaces, began to unite and speak
of the individual and social evils of crowding too many peo-
ple in too small areas in cities, without making provision for
the people to keep in frequent contact with the elements of
a natural environment. They advocated the preservation of
large areas within cities to serve as retreats for the people,
for rest in an environment of peace, quietness, and natural
beauty, and for such forms of active recreation as would not
destroy the essential quality of the areas as places of inspi-
ration and enjoyment of the beauties of nature.

The first concrete result of this movement was Central
Park in New York City, in 1853, followed in rapid succes-

RECREATION

Spaces Mean to the American People

sion by the establishment of similar parks in several other
large cities of the United States. From these beginnings,
during the last half of the nineteenth century, have evolved
the elaborate systems of recreation areas providing for both
active and passive recreation in our cities of today. In 1885,
the first playground was established in Boston and in 1906,
with the founding of the Playground Association of Ameri-
ca, now the National Recreation Association, the national
recreation movement was well under way.

In 1892-93, the Boston Metropolitan Park System was es-
tablished as a special method of handling on a district basis
the acquisition, development, and administration of recrea-
tion areas not practicable for local, town, and city govern-
ments in the region to handle alone. The metropolitan dis-
trict plan has, of course, since spread to other sections of the
country.

In 1895, the first county park system was established in
Essex County, New Jersey. The principal county recreation
developments since then have been in counties in the metro-
politan regions of large cities serving practically the same
functions as metropolitan park districts, although in a few
counties the recreation service provided is primarily for
rural and small rural-urban communities. In some parts of
the country townships and special districts have also been
used to administer recreation systems.

Between 1870 and 1880, a few states such as California,
New York, Michigan, and Minnesota began to establish state
parks and recreation areas—a movement which has since
spread to every state in the union with Colorado, the last
state to do so, establishing a state park agency in 1955. The
establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 marked
the entrance of the federal government into the field of
conservation of natural resources for recreation, from which
has grown the magnificent system of national recreation
areas now available to us all.

I do not know whether or not there was any conscious plan
on the part of the American people or their leaders to sub-
stitute local, state, and national parks and other open spaces
for the frontiers and boundless open spaces of the past so
that the best values of frontier and pioneer life could be
perpetuated. Perhaps they were seeking simply to assure
some opportunities for happier and more abundant lives
through active outdoor recreation or passive enjoyment of
nature without really knowing why the American people had
a special need for parks and open “spaces.

It is fortunate, indeed, that the early twentieth century
pioneers in conservation, park, and recreation planning were
so successful. Thanks to their farsightedness we have made
a good start in the acquisition of an adequate network of
national, state, and local parks and recreation areas. In the
transition period between the age of the frontier, the in-
dustrial revolution, and a new age of leisure, they have pro-

OCTOBER 1955

vided the American people with a down payment on the kind
of land dedicated to the public use which we are going to
need to live successfully in this new age.

Here I am using the word “recreation” as it was used in
the 1934 report of the National Park Service for the Land
Planning Committee of the National Resources Board to
connote “all that is recreative of the individual, the commu-
nity or the nation. In this sense, it is broader than the
‘physical activity’ concept. It includes mental and spiritual
expression. It allows gratification of the nearly infinite
variety of tastes and predilections so far as that gratification
is consistent with sustained utilization of the nation’s rec-
reational resources.”

I think all of us here today would agree with the views
expressed in that 1934- report that, “The public recreation
movement in America represents a conscious cultural ideal
of the American people, just as the great system of public
education represented such an idea. It takes rank with the
system of public education as a necessary addition to the
cultural equipment of the nation. Its supreme objective is
the promotion of the general welfare through the creation
of opportunities for a more abundant and happier life for
everyone.”

The great, untracked wilderness is gone. The frontier is
passed. The age of leisure is here. The impact of advertis-
ing through every possible media proclaims. that this is so.
We are constantly being besieged to buy products which
will help us enjoy our leisure the more. And incidentally,
may I note in passing, that a great many of these products
are ones which are consumed or used enroute or at our pub-
lic parks and recreation areas, or they are products which we
need special recreation skills and training to enjoy.

The 1950 census reports gave the first really substantial
statistical information indicating that leisure is now possi-
ble for everyone and not just for the favored few. Since
then, business publications, reports, and magazines have as-
sembled an amazing collection of facts which demonstrate
conclusively that recreation and leisure are now of major
importance to American living, and that in the years ahead
leisure and how it is used will be a major concern of every
business and industry, civic organization, school, church,
and unit of government. Total production in 1950, 1951,
1952, and 1953 set successive new records over the previous
high achieved at the peak of wartime production in 1944
when it reached $268,000,000,000.

The Committee for Economic Development, a private re-
search organization, has predicted that by 1965 gross na-
tional production will total $535,000,000,000, an increase of
fifty per cent over present rates. Output'per man-hour as
estimated by the Federal Reserve has been steadily increas-
ing at an annual rate of two per cent or more since 1947.
There is no sign that American industry, especially in the

373.

coming age of automation, cannot, at least, maintain that
performance.

What does this mean in terms of the families of America?
It means simply this: in 1944 the average family had an
income of $3,610, as compared to $4,460 in 1950. In 1953,
the average family income was well in excess of $5,000. In
1929, only thirty-oneper cent of all American families had
incomes between $3,000 and $10,000 a year, while in 1953
fifty-eight per cent of all families had such incomes meas-
ured in dollars of like purchasing power.

One million families, according to a book just issued by
the editors of Fortune magazine under the title The Chang-
ing American Market, are crossing the $4,000 income figure
a year, and in five years a like number will be crossing the
$5,000 income line.

Business Week magazine, more than a year ago, said,
“Spending money on leisure is no longer considered an eco-
nomic waste. In fact, the future economy of America will be
built upon leisure-time spending. There is just so much
food and clothing and shelter and other things needed for
bare existence. There is no foreseeable limit to what we need
and. can use as our leisure time increases.”

Recreation in the Age of Leisure

There can be no doubt that one of the major trends in
living today is leisure. It is a fact. How we are prepared
to use it and what we do with it will, to a great extent, "de-
termine the kind of people and the kind of nation we will
be in the years ahead.

I wish I could confidently say that the future American
character will be moulded in as desirable a way by the fact
of leisure as it was by the fact of wilderness and the frontier.
I wish I could say open spaces were available now to help
the growth of the American character in the same tradition
as in pioneer America. We have time, money, and people
for leisure. But we have not yet developed an ethics of
leisure, sufiicient leaders for leisure, and above all, adequate
spaces to enjoy leisure activities.

Open Space for leisure living is essential for the continued
growth of the kind of American character we cherish. With-
out places to play, a philos0phy of recreation, an ethics of
leisure, will be of little value. The age of leisure will become
a stunted and meaningless thing. Unless an informed public
aggressively insists on its right to adequate park and other
recreation areas, the vanishing wilderness and the vanishing
frontier will be joined by a vanishing Opportunity for out-
door recreation.

How critical is the need for additional parks and open
spaces? An estimate of the National Resources Planning
Board in 1942 stated that four million additional acres of
state park land should be acquired to meet the needs of the
expanding pepulation. By comparison, between 1939 and
1952 only 500,000 acres were actually acquired.

Consider, for example, the latest Twentieth Century Fund
report on “America’s Needs and Resources.” It says that in
1950 an additional 276,000 acres of park land were needed
by urban residents to bring their cities up to the basic stand—
ard. Very few of these needed acres have been acquired.

374

At the national level, attendance at national parks and
recreation areas has increased enormously. In 1916 when
the National Park Service was created by law only 358,000
people visited the areas under its supervision. Last year the
attendance was forty-eight million. Visitors to the Corps of
Engineers projects increased from ten million in 1949 to
twenty-six million in 1951, and 53,848,000 in 1954.

According to Conrad Wirth, director of the National Park
Service, it will require two and a half times the present
appropriation over a ten-year period to correct the present
bad campground conditions and double the present facilities.

The problems of Open space, its development and main-
tenance at the national level, have received much national
publicity in the past few years. It will need much more
before the average American will insist on better provisions
for his leisure in the national parks, forests, and other rec-
reation areas under the federal government.

But what is happening at the local level receives only local
publicity. So far, there has been little national publicity
given to the critical need for new park areas and open spaces
in cities and towns and suburban areas. And yet, in city after
city, and suburb after suburb, the competition for the use of
the remaining open space is becoming tremendous.

Existing park land is being sought for fire stations, super
highways, uvenile detention homes, public housing, and
other public purposes as well as for private use. At the same
time, new neighborhoods are being built overnight by de-
ve10pers and subdividers. A recent article in the New York
Herald Tribune reports:

“All this points up what community planners in all the
suburban areas are emphasizing as the basic need—-—land
acquisition for future growth. They are in agreement that
the localities themselves——-—the counties, cities, towns, and
villages—must act soon to acquire the land sites for play-
grounds which may not be needed for years to come. De-
velopment is moving so fast that available recreational sites
are vanishing overnight.”

Professional park and recreation people, representatives
of citizen boards and committees must help alert the Ameri-
can pe0ple to the very serious need for the protection of exist-
ing parks, water resources, conservation areas, and other
recreation sites, and for the expansion of those areas to meet
the new need of a leisure age. Informed professionals and
civic leaders need to be joined by business and industry in
a massive campaign to assure adequate parks and open
spaces for the future. The stake of private enterprise in the
new leisure is great.

So serious is the problem, that I cannot help but urge
that a series of conferences like this one be called and at-
tended by the sponsoring “and c00perating organizations of
this conference and by all other agencies, public and private,
concerned with recreation in all its manifold aSpects. Out
of such conferences should come the preparation, adeption,
and implementation of a nation-wide recreation policy, plan,
program, and administrative framework through which the
American people can provide for themselves adequate oppor-
tunities for the best and most satisfying use of their ex-
panding leisure time. 0

The
Craft Arts

in
Education

Harold J. Brennan

ONE OF THE most astonishing move-
ments in the United States in the
last quarter of a century has been the
tremendous renascence of interest in
the crafts: weaving, ceramics, metal-
crafts, and furniture making. This de-
velopment has not come about primar-
ily as the result of encouragement by
schools and museums (with a few nota-
ble exceptions) but rather through dis-
covery of the craft arts by hundreds and
thousands of people who must know
something worthwhile and meaningful
to them when they see it. They have
joined weavers’ guilds, taken courses in
home bureau groups and similar adult
and extension programs, and bought
craft “kits” and tools, often with more
enthusiasm than direction.

This extraordinary activity has some-
what bewildered those of us in teaching
whose duty it is to relate our programs
in art and education to the life interests
and needs of our students. Our laggard
deliberations and planning have been
left far behind as the rapidly acceler-
ating desire for activity and instruction
in the craft arts has forced students-—
both young and adult — to find help
where they can. Education, on the
whole, necessarily must move somewhat
slowly; but it was apparent, some years
ago, that the quickening awareness of
the aesthetic and constructive value of
the craft arts was neither trivial nor
temporary. It was founded on some
basic human needs as well as on funda-
mental and historic characteristics of
our American culture.

MR. BRENNAN is director of the School
for American Craftsmen, Rochester I n-

stitute of Technology, Rochester, N. Y.
OCTOBER 1955

The place of handcraft in the educational program—elementary, sec-
ondary, college, and universitymhas appeared rather frequently as
a subject for discussion at meetings of art teachers in the last few years.
Caught unawares by the great public interest in handcraft, educational
institutions are now being faced by a demand for courses in crafts,
coming from peeple with a wide range of interests—amateurs, pro-
fessionals, teachers, therapists, and designers for various industries.

The reaction, in educational meet-
ings, to this wide public demand has
been more negative than constructive.
Put on the defensive by the tide of in-
terest, the associations of teachers be-
rate the use of kits and voice strong
feelings decrying their use. Often there
is an underlying misgiving as to the
artistic worth of the craft arts, and their
expressive or creative possibilities.
These latter sentiments are always sup-
plied by teachers who know little or
nothing of handcraft. But, being teach-
ers, they do speak with a measure of
professional authority, and their opin-
ions are taken more seriously than they
merit.

The great assault is on the kits and
other props and crutches. At the re-
gional and national meetings of the art
associations, except for one, a consider-
able area is always filled with the dis-
plays of commercial firms that supply
kits, designs, and other aids which pro-
fess to help the novice or assist the more
experienced craftsmen. The oibcial
view, on the part of the art group, is
usually one of strong disapproval of
the classroom use of such materials.
There is little real evidence of any posi-
tive and constructive effort to find an
alternative to the kits or toward the de-
velopment of some course of action. It
is a hard and unpleasant thing to say,
but the kits have come to fill a vacuum,
and supply needs and interests for
which the majority of the schools and
museums have neglected to provide.
They may be a poor and unsatisfactory
answer to a demand, and contribute
little, if anything, to the individual
which will lead to his constructive or
creative advance. But the fact is that
the kits and other commercial aids exist
because schools and museums have
failed to recognize the craft arts in their
educational and exhibition programs.

There is not as yet any general aware-
ness of the need for a re-evaluation of
the content of the art program, and for
the broad introduction of soundly con-
ceived and properly taught courses in
the craft arts. Only a few of the muse-
ums, one of the important channels
through which the public becomes ac-
quainted with new practices and ideas
in the arts, have seen {it to give a proper
emphasis to the crafts, although their
record in this respect does seem better
than that of the schools.

The great Designer Craftsman 1953
Exhibition, sponsored by the American
Craftsman’s Educational Council and
fourteen leading American museums,
marked a definitive milestone for crafts-
men in the United States. First shown
at the Brooklyn (New York) Museum
in December 1953, it has been on tour
since. Excellent and meaningful as this
exhibition was, the opinion was gener-
ally held that practicing craftsmen, or
persons with a first-hand working rela-
tionship with craft arts production,
could have contributed more signifi-
cantly to the judging of the show. The
crafts sections of many shows too often
are judged by museum directors, paint-
ers, and sculptors, who, with more self-
confidence than knowledge, award
prizes to weavers, potters, silversmiths,
and furniture designers.

Two years ago the president of a
Midwest university made this observa-
tion: “Perhaps we have grown to be-
lieve unwiser that the building, the
work of sculpture, or the painting are
the only forms of art. But we should
look about us . . . and see the beauty and
utility that the craftsmen and designers
have brought to enrich our lives.” 0

DISPLAYING arts and crafts projects made by the members

of a youth-serving informal educational or recreational
agency usually poses a problem to administrators. The
usual type of display does not draw the interest, nor does it
allow adults to see the youth in action, with all their vim,
vigor, and vitality.

During the past summer, the staff members of the Deborah
Boys’ Club of Chicago hit upon an idea—"to conduct an open
air art fair and exhibit to show the community the work of
the members. The fair was planned with the following pur-

poses in mind:
1. To allow parents and community members to vicw the

creative proects made by the club members.
2. To give recognition to each participant in the summer
art program by having them produce and display their crc-

ative works.

3. To get a carnival atmosphere by having the exhibits
and products displayed in a colorful booth arrangement.

4. To allow the members to sell their creative projects
for an even greater sense of accomplishment.

In order to achieve these purposes a great deal of plan-
ning and coordination was necessary. First, a purpose had
to be determined for selling the products made by the
members. This was arrived at by a staff consultation as to
the item most needed in the art department. The unanimous
decision reached was that our ceramic kiln was inadequate
and dangerous to use; therefore, all funds should be directed
toward buying a new kiln.

The next decision to be made was what items would be
easiest to make, what would be most saleable, and what
would keep the interest of the members in production. The
economy of the product was a very important point to con-

sider, as the budget was limited, and overhead had to be
kept low. Mr. Samuel Wenet, club program director, Mrs.
Esther Sklarewitz and Miss Charlotte Labinger, summer
play club directors, headed the fair and planned the projects
to be developed.

The final decisions on these problems were made after
the staff reviewed the creative arts and crafts projects which
the members had worked on during the summer. All of the
items—papier-maché dolls, sculpture, leatherwork, paper
plate candy dishes, coasters, cup holders, photogram paper
weights, wire sculptures, papier-maché wall masks, leaf print
napkins, and spatter prints were made from scrap materials
obtained from companies and individuals interested in con-
tributing to the club. The use of these materials in creating
projects kept the overhead to a bare minimum.

After the general planning was done, a date was set for
the big affair. The total agency staff was then asked to in-
vite their groups to participate by making articles to sell.
The exhibits which were not intended for selling purposes

were those items made by special interest groups in their
regular activity period. These included drawing and
paintings by individuals and murals by the play club
groups.

The prospect of conducting and participating in the
art fair attracted one hundred and twenty members,
some of whom had not actively participated in any of the
activities in the club until this event was announced,
only three weeks prior to the date set for the fair.

The invitations were designed and silkscreened by
hand in the art department and were mailed to all of the
boards of directors of the sponsoring organizations——

the Deborah Woman’s Club, Young Men’s Jewish Coun-
cil, and the Deborah Boys’ Club Parents Association.

For the three weeks prior to the event, each group met
three times a week specifically to work on their projects.
Signs were printed by the members and posters were
designed, painted, and displayed to tell of the coming
event. A full publicity program was outlined to inform
the newspapers, and, due to the uniqueness of the activity,
the newspapers, both local and city-wide, responded by giv-
ing advance coverage as well as coverage of the activity
itself. The day before the fair, “sandwich men” roamed the
neighborhood informing neighbors in the community of the
event and inviting them to attend. The whole plan was to con-
duct the fair and exhibit outside of the building on the front
porch and adjoining sidewalks, with the provision that if it
rained, it would move indoors to the club gymnasium.

The big day arrived, and Chicago was hit by one of the
biggest summer storms in its history, but by 2300 P.M., an
hour before the scheduled opening, the sky cleared and the
task of setting up started.

An outsider watching the activities between 2:00 and 3 :00
P.M. would have exclaimed that it was “chaos,” but after
looking a little closer, would have realized that it was or-
ganized chaos.

At 3:00 P.M. everything was in order—the cooking classes
had their booth ready to sell cookies, hot dogs, and cokes.
The artists and craftsmen were ready to demonstrate the

process involved in creating their products and to sell
their wares, and club photographers were busy snapping
pictures. w

For three hours the fair continued, with over four
hundred parents, neighbors, members of the boards of
directors, boy and girl club members, and interested
persons just walking by—viewing, buying, and marvel-
ing at the work which the children were displaying.

The fair proved successful, the children had an enj oy-
able time and were proud to show their work. The adults
saw not only the work produced by these eight-to-twelve—
year-olds, but also were swept up by the enthusiasm and
salesmanship of the youth to the tune of spending over
one hundred dollars to help the club buy its ceramic kiln.
Probably the happiest were the staff members who had
finally found a constructive way to display the arts and
craft work of the members to an enthusiastic and re-
ceptive audience. 0

Whom Shall We Train?

Standing as it does at the meeting
point of its past career of growth and
development and the period of profes-
sional advancement, the recreation pro-
fession can well give consideration to
the selection of the human material
which will play the major role in its
future performance.

Through the past half-century, when
we were attempting to gain recognition
and to consolidate our gradual gains,
there was relatively little opportunity to
be “choosey” about personnel. Inci-
dentally, that may be the reason why
some of us who are still around were
able to slip in.

The playground movement, as it was

known for some time, was obliged to
recruit its personnel from outside fields.
There was no reservoir of trained per-
sonnel from which to draw. Only in the
allied field of education did there ap-
pear to be the source of personnel for
the new recreation venture.

Only those who have been identified
with the recreation movement since
those early years can duly appreciate its
attainments in the direction of im-
proved personnel. The simultaneous de-
velopment of a number of factors has
effected these attainments.
these factors are:

0 The organization and development of
professional improvement groups.

Some of

o The attainment of suliicient maturity
to give dignity of character to the rec-
reation movement.

0 The gradual evolution of a philoso-
phy of recreation. I

o The recognition of recreation by col-
leges and universities and the granting
of degrees therein.

Stephen H. Mahoney

0 The resultant growing source of
trained personnel.

0 The opportunities for study and re-
search.

These attainments will reflect them-
selves throughout the whole field of rec-
reation. As they continue on to greater
degree, the profession must be ready to
assimilate their benefits. The subject
of personnel must become the major
concern of every person identified with
recreation. ‘

The time has come to take advantage
of the supply of trained leadership.
Over the years most of us have watched
some excellent leadership material slip
away from us. How many young peo-
ple, whom we have trained as part-time
leaders during their college days, have
entered other fields and other profes-
sions because we could not hold them?

The situation involving the supply of
trained leadership is a reciprocal one.
If colleges are to continue to build up a
supply of trained personnel, then the
profession must present the demand for
it. Unless this supply and demand is
maintained at its proper ratio, much of
the ground which has been gained will
be lost. The time for action is now.

As long as positions in recreation are
held at the level of importance which
they have occupied up to now, the out-
look 'for better leadership will remain
dim. As long as the recreation worker
is relegated to the same category of em-
ployment as is occupied by the rank
and file of the employees in the general
personnel structure of ‘the community,
there will be no outlook for improve-
ment. As long as the general concep-
tion of a recreation worker’s impor-
tance is held inferior to that of the em-

379

ployee in the education system, there
wil- be no professional advancement.
Until such time as some of the bar-
riers which block our progress are re-
moved, we will not advance. The legal
blocks which confront us must be re-
moved. The statutes which forbid rec-
reation officials to set up educational
qualifications in competitive examina-
tions must be repealed. The ru'es which
specify that in civil service examina—
tions there is no opportunity for oral
testing must be changed. The relatively
low evaluation placed on recreation po-
sitions by community administrative of-
ficials must be changed. The removal of
these and other impediments is the chal-
lenge which confronts those of us who
constitute the recreation profession.
These thoughts, relative to the selec-
tion of recreation personnel, are my
conception of the most necessary steps
to be taken in connection with the gen-
eral topic—leadership training. Under-
lying these there is the same basic need
that is essential to the professional
growth of the whole recreation move-
ment. I believe, hdwever, that it is with-

opportunity for action lies.

The place of recreation in our society
is no longer a conjecture; its effects on
every phase of our life are recognized
almost universally. Its greatest potenti-
alities have not yet been manifested.
The weakest point in its present struc-
ture is the lack of recognition given to
its personnel.

The power to improve this recogni-
tion lies within the recreation profes-
sion itself. This power, now latent in
the ranks, can be harnessed and utilized
with great effect. With every medium
at our command, the message of a
“voice of recreation” program must
penetrate _to the remotest corners. No
longer can the importance of recreation
as a vocation be hidden. The opportu-
nity it affords the young man or the
young woman with academic and pro-
fessional training must be stressed. This
professional challenge confronting
every leader in the recreation movement
must be met by him both as an individ-
ual and as a member of the professional
organizations. In many sections of the
country this challenge is being met with

can serve both as a precedent and an in-
spiration for further achievement.

The professional worker in recrea-
tion must be equipped with all the attri-
butes of a profession. Not only profes-
sional salary inducements, but the con-
ditions of employment, the tenure, the
opportunity for advancement, the
chance for professional improvement,
and for membership in professional or-
ganizations——-—these must be set forth in
prospect for the trained leader.

It has been the lot of many of us who
are identified with recreation to have
been in a position to watch its growth
from infancy to maturity. At every step
along the way we have stressed the im-
portance of leadership as the most es-

TRAVEL TOWN-U. s. A.

A Museum fo En]

This amazing municipal facility is one
of the world’s most unusual collections
of vehicles of all types and vintage. On
display are locomotives, an old caboose,
Union Pacific diner, airplane, and so on.

ROBABLY the greatest letter-off-of-

steam in the history of children
(and that goes back a long way) has
become a large-scale project of the city
of Los Angeles.

It is Travel Town, a permanent out-
door transportation museum in Griffith
Park. “Museum” is something of a mis-
nomer, because it connotes passive ob-
servation. The big point about Travel
Town is that everything in it is to be ac-
tively enjoyed.

It is a haven for any kid who ever
wanted to ride a locomotive, fool
around a firehouse, or see what it feels
like to be the pilot of an airplane. Travel
Town’s appurtenances include real-life
examples of all these types of rolling
stock, along with much auxiliary equip-
ment. Furthermore, children, instead
of being fenced off and cautioned not
to touch, are supposed to clamber over
and around them and monkey with
them to their hearts’ content.

Travel Town was started after the
war with some old firehouse equipment,
a J ap Zero fighter plane, and an old 10-
comotive. It is now growing by the
week, with one item after another added
as public-spirited citizens and organi-
zations have been caught up in the
whirlwind of youthful enthusiasm it
generates.

It now boasts a large array of locomo-
tives and other rolling stock from sev-
eral railroads; more fire engines; an

A new policy of loan exhibits has just
been instituted. A San Francisco cable
car was sent down here as a decorative
motif for the Los Angeles International
Flower Show. Before it could be re-
turned, the Los Angeles city fathers pre-
vailed on the San Francisco city fathers
to let it pause for the kids to play on.

One segment of the railroad collec-
tion has been set up for actual opera-
tion on a half-mile track, dubbed the
Crystal Springs and Southwestern Rail-
road. It comprises a 1910 locomotive
and two passenger cars which ran for
years between Honolulu and Weianae
in Hawaii. The equipment was donated
and transported to Los Angeles by the
Matson Steamship Line and hauled the
twenty-five miles inland to the park by
a local trucking company" Kids and
their parents, at fares of ten and twenty
cents, have been riding on it at a rate
of three thousand every weekend. Ad-
mission to Travel Town itself is free.

There is also a 1909 locomotive from
the Western Pacific Railroad, a 1920
locomotive from the local Santa Maria

Valley Railroad, a caboose, and a 1920

dining car from the Union Pacific Rail-
road. The diner’s original cost was
$100,000.

A recent addition to the collection
was a Los Angeles Fire Department

under conversion to auto traction. The
Western Union Telegraph Company has
just joined in the fun by equipping the
old depot with a full-fledged old-time
telegraph system.

The Western Pacific locomotive,
which with its tender is seventy feet
long and weighs over 1,700 tons, was
in actual freight service up to within a
few weeks of its addition to the mu-
seum.

The collection includes also an 1882
locomotive from the old Central Pacific
Railroad. It was donated by the Cali-
fornia chapter of the Railroad and Lo-
comotive Historical Society of America.

Travel Town is an operation of the
city recreation and park department. It
is in the northwest corner of GrifEth
Park, on the edge of the suburb of Bur-
bank, close to Warner Brothers studios.

The grounds have ample space for
the growing collection, and its possibili-
ties are seen as almost limitless and en-
compassing such additions as a subma-
rine and a blimp. The only real problem
is how to get a sizeable‘ship that far
inland.

Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of
children have been delighted and their
parents rendered eternally grateful for
this ideal outlet for youthful exuberance
and curiosity. 0

[Indoor Arti iGittl Ice Skating Rinks

Present upward surge of interest leads to con-
sideration of construction, costs, and values.

INTEREST and participation in outdoor winter sports have
mounted rapidly in the last few years and there is no
winter sport in which so many individuals take part or which
is provided more widely than ice skating. The Recreation
and Park Yearbook for 19501 showed that facilities for ice
skating far outnumbered all other winter types. More than
700 cities reported a total of 3,274 outdoor skating areas
with an attendance of 8,000,000 at little more than half of
the rinks.

In communities where there are ponds, lakes, or streams
suitable for ice skating, these can be used with little prepara-
tion on days when the ice is sufficiently thick to permit the
activity to be carried on safely. In other communities, how-
ever, where it is necessary to spray or fiood areas for ice
skating and where, as is often the case, advance preparation
of the rink is required, the number of skating days in the
past few winters has not been sufficient to justify the eXpense
of preparing such facilities. Recreation and park authori-
ties have recently been receiving too little cooperation from
the weather.

For this reason, interest in the construction of artificial
rinks has taken an upward surge in the last two or three
years, with the 1955 World I ce Skating Guide (see bibliog-

raphy at end of this article) estimating more than one hun-

dred new artificial ice skating centers built in 1954 in North
America. The number of municipalities erecting mechanic-
ally frozen outdoor rinks is growing, and many cities are
investigating the costs and values of installing one.

Rink Types and Construction

An artificial skating rink consists of a floor sprayed or
flooded and frozen for skating and the refrigeration equip-
ment essential to produce and maintain the ice. Many of the
municipal installations use ammonia compressors which are
driven by electric motors or other power condensers and an
ammonia receiving tank. If the brine system of refrigera-
tion is used, a brine cooler and brine pumps are required. A
refrigeration unit is connected with the pipes in the rink
through header or feeder pipes at one end of the rink. A
building is also needed to house the refrigeration machinery,
unless it is mounted on a trailer truck, and afford a shelter
for skaters. Other features usually provided are Hood lights,
seats for spectators, a woven wire enclosure and, if the rink
is to be used for ice hockey, dasher boards around the rink,
players’ benches and penalty boxes.

Three general types of rinks have been installed. The rink
surface floor of one type is composed of a reinforced con-
crete Heating slab in which has been installed a system of
pipes through which the freezing solution circulates; an-
other consists of an area in which the pipes have been im-
bedded in sand, crushed stone, or similar material. The
third type, which is known as the roll-up or take-up rink,
consists of some form of plastic pipe laid on supports and
set on a thin layer of sand over a turf, soil, or paved surface.

Iron header pipes, which are enclosed in a permanent

installation, conduct brine to plastic tubes in Detroit’s
take-up rinks. These tubes can be rolled up and stored.

The first type of installation involves the construction of
a permanent all—purpose floor, usually with a monolithic
concrete surface. The ice sheet is built up directly on the
concrete floor and when the skating season is finished, the
area can be used for roller skating, tennis, and a variety of
other activities. Wrought iron or standard mild steel pipe, of
1- or l%-inch diameter and set at 4-inch centers, is com-
monly used for this type of rink. It has good thermal con-
ductivity and therefore requires less refrigeration capacity
than some other materials. One disadvantage in this type
of construction is the difficulty in repairing a leak, crack, or
other deterioration which might occur within the slab.
Studies have shown practically no corrosion in rinks with
direct expansion refrigeration. The cost of the all-purpose
rink is higher than that of the other two types.

In the open type of rink the ice surface is built upon iron
or steel pipes imbedded in sand or crushed stone, with the
pipes usually resting on sleepers creosoted under pressure
and fastened to them with galvanized clips. (Cinders or
clay should not be used to surround the pipes.) It is less
expensive than the permanent rink and it has the advantage
that leaks can be detected easily and repaired rapidly. In
case a permanent rink on the site is ultimately desired, but
sufficient funds are not available for constructing it, or if
settlement of the area has not been completed, this type of
rink may be installed in such a manner that it can later be
covered with concrete in order to form a permanent all-pur-
pose court. Where installed on an area such as an athletic
field, which is to be used during the spring, summer, and
fall, the rink may be constructed several inches below the
surface and covered with tar paper and clay or top soil at the
end of the skating season. This type of rink can be removed
at the end of the skating season, but the cost of doing so
would be very considerable. Subdrainage is important under
the concrete and open type of rinks.

OCTOBER 1955

The roll-up or take-up rink is the least expensive and can
be installed on almost any reasonably level surface, such as
that of a paved tennis court, lawn, or a dirt area. A paved
area, however, is considered preferable to other surfaces.
The roll-up rink, based on polyethylene plastic pipe, can be
installed quickly and taken up and stored easily so that the
area can be used for other activities during the spring, sum-
mer, and fall. The light-weight pipe has less thermal con-
ductivity than wrought iron, but it has proved effective al-
though it has not been in use long enough to determine its
life expectancy. Deterioration owing to chemical action
should be negligible, but because skate blades will pierce
the pipe easily, the installation of sheet metal protectors is
necessary. This adds to the cost and decreases the heat
transfer. If the location of the rink is more or less experi-
mental, the refrigeration unit may be mounted on a trailer
truck rather than installed in a building. At the end of the
skating season, the plastic pipe can be rolled up in rink
length sections and stored until the autumn when it can
be relaid. The iron header pipes used to carry the refriger-
ant to the plastic pipes, and extending along one side of the
rink, are commonly boxed and a permanent installation.

Determination of the type, size, arrangement, and loca-
tion of the refrigeration equipment and the piping system
for the refrigerant involves a variety of local factors and
requires the advice of an experienced refrigeration engineer.
It is suggested that the company building the rink be re.
quired to post a performance bond, in order to avoid the
unfortunate experience of one or two communities with rinks
that failed to function properly. The National Recreation
Association has compiled a list of companies or engineers
who have designed or built artificial outdoor rinks and will
furnish information concerning rink construction to any
community interested in building one.2 The data book of
the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers (see bibli-
ography at end of article) is an excellent reference source.

Location and Size

Location of the rink is an important factor in. determining
its success. It must be a well-drained site, adequate in size
not only for the rink itself but for its accessory features. It
should be readily accessible, preferably by public transpor-
tation, but since many people will drive to the rink, ample
space “for parking must be provided. Proximity to water,
power, and sewer lines reduces construction costs, as does
availability of a building to house the refrigeration equip-
ment and serve as a shelter for skaters, check room for shoes
and skates, and concession stand. Most public rinks are lo-
cated in parks; roll-up rinks have been built on lawn areas,
ball diamonds and tennis courts.

Most municipal outdoor rinks and many of the others built
by institutions or commercial interests are approximately
85 by 185 feet. These are the average dimensions of an
ochial ice-hockey rink. If the rink is to be used to any con-

siderable extent for ice hockey, the corners should be round-
ed, with a 15-foot radius, and should be surrounded by a
wooden barrier 3- to 4-feet high, preferably cream color.
A few rinks are wider than 100 feet or as long as 200 feet;
others, built exclusively for skating, are smaller.

Construction Costs

Construction costs can only be roughly estimated because
of so many local factors, such as the availability of water,
power, and a structure for housing the refrigeration equip-
ment and for a skating shelter, as well as the size and type
of construction of the rink itself. Four permanent-type
rinks, each 120 by 178 feet, were built in Toronto in 1950
at a cost of approximately $125,000 each, including the con-
struction of a small equipment building. It was estimated
in 1953 that a permanent-type rink 120 by 178 feet would
cost approximately $150,000 in New York State; a rink 85
by 185 feet, $115,000, and an area 85 by 125 feet about
$77,000.

A rink, 85 by 185 feet, built in Utica, New York, in 1954,
required two compressors, two pumps, electric controls, ap-
proximately 50,000 feet of wrought-iron pipe encased in
concrete, and other incidental equipment. Installation costs:

and the construction of a retaining wall; on the other hand,
it was possible to use an existing field house as a shelter.

A rink, also 85 by 185 feet, built in Hamtramck, Michi-
gan, in 1954, including metal pipe installation but no con-
crete floor, electrical work and construction of an equip-
ment room and a concession building, was built for approxi-
mately $90,000. In 1954 Jersey City, New Jersey, erected
a rink 85 by 190 feet using wrought-iron pipe set under the
playing field at the city stadium at an equipment cost of
$75,000. Two sixty-ton compressors circulate brine through
ten miles of pipe. Existing facilities were used to house the
equipment and to serve as a skating shelter. A third city has
awarded a contract for a rink, 85 by 190 feet, at a construc-
tion cost of approximately $80,000. The rink is to have a
sand floor and an existing building is to be used for housing
the refrigeration equipment.

Flint, Michigan, in 1954 installed a roll-up rink on three
tennis courts, 120 by 180 feet, surrounded by a 12-foot chain
link fence. The costs of this unusually large rink were:

Detroit, Michigan, has built three rinks using the roll-un
polyethylene plastic pipe. The department of parks and rec-

384

reation reports that such a rink, 85 by 185 feet, can be con-
structed at an over-all cost not to exceed $60,000 including

refrigeration unit and all incidentals. Its three rinks, 83 by

140 feet, 85 by 120 feet, and 85 by 185 feet, represent a total
investment of little more than $150,000.

A well known consultant estimates that a roll-up rink,
86 by 185 feet, can be built at a cost _of $40,000 for the rink
proper, plus approximately $18,000 for ice machinery, or
about the same amount as the Detroit estimate. A rink can

be taken up at a cost of approximately $900 and relaid for
$1,000 to $1,200, at a $2.00 per man-hour rate.

Operating Cost and Income

Operating cost data are of unusually limited value be-
cause, in addition to varying local conditions, most of the
municipal outdoor rinks have been in use for only one sea-
son. Detroit rinks are reported to cost an average of $100
per day each for Operation and maintenance. Other esti-
mates and cost figures indicate an average daily expense
varying from $85 to $150. It seems probable that some costs

may be reduced as Operators gain added experience; for
example, one official believes it should be possible to reduce
the weekly payroll from $900 to $500 by better selection
of personnel.

People using artificial rinks, like those using swimming
pools, golf courses, and other public facilities involving
high initial and operating costs, are expected to pay a fee,
which is usually designed to provide sufficient income to
mect the cost of operation and maintenance. From the
limited information available it seems probable that the re-
ceipts from admission fees, concessions and other sources
did not equal the current costs at most public rinks last year.

In onc city children used the rink free on afternoons,
Monday through Friday, and on Saturday morning. At
other sessions they paid the samc fee as adults, fifty cents.
Another city charged fifteen cents afternoons and twenty-five
cents evenings. Rates at a third rink were twenty-five cents

RECREATION

for afternoon sessions and fifty cents for each of two eve-
ning sessions, 6:30 to 8:30 and 9:00 to 10:30. Afternoon
skating is free at the Detroit rinks, but a service fee of ten
cents for children and twenty-five cents for adults is charged
in the evening. At the Wollman rink in New -York City,3
which did show a profit, children have free use on Satur-
day mornings, holidays and school vacation; afternoon and
evening rates vary from ten to fifty cents; with one dollar for
special figure-skating periods.

Rink Personnel

The number of workers required at a rink varies with its
size and hours of operation. It also depends upon the serv-
ices rendered; more personnel is needed if a refreshment
stand is operated and skate and shoe checking is provided.
Detroit employs six workers at each of its rinks; two cities,
nine each; another, fifteen. The city which believes its staff
could be reduced employs sixteen workers. The annual pay-
roll in four cities varies from $6,000 to $18,000 per rink.

An engineer is required to operate the rink machinery.

J

 

Metal pipe installation is used in this open-type rink in
Hamtramck, Michigan. It can later be converted into a
concrete all-purpose area for varied year-round activity.

One city employs two refrigeration operators for its rink;
another states that a licensed operating refrigerating engi-
neer should be on duty twenty-four hours per day. Two or
more ice supervisors or guards, a cashier, and custodian or
ice maintenance workers are employed at each rink. A
rink manager, check room attendant, ticket taker, concession
worker, and skate checker are other types of rink personnel.

Use Periods

Hours of operation also vary from city to city. The
Detroit rinks were open from 3:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. on
weekdays and from 9:00 AM. to 11:00 P.M. on weekends.
The Utica rink was operated from 10:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.
In Jersey City the hours were 3:30 to 5:30 and 7:30 to
10:30 P.M., Monday through Fridays; Saturdays, 10:00
A.M. to 12 M., 2:30 to 5:30 and 7:30 to 10:30 P.M.; Sundays,

the same as Saturday except no morning session. A rink
must be closed for brief periods each day in order to plane,
clean, and resurface the ice. Special equipment has been
devised to facilitate this operation.

The average skating season is four months, with most
rinks opening early in November and closing in mid-March,
or approximately 125 days. The large Wollman rink in
Central Park, New York, however, which attracts nearly
400,000 skaters during its season, is in operation from early
November till late in April. The weather is an important
factor, because if the temperature or humidity rises too
high, the cost of maintaining the ice becomes excessive. In
some cases a rink that has been closed during the day, when
the temperature has risen above the mid-seventies, was in
good condition for evening use.

People Served

The capacity of an average hockey rink ice-area—85 by
185 feet—has been estimated to be 800, although all of the
skaters will _not be on the ice at one time. Another basis for
determining a rink’s capacity is to allow 30 square feet per
skater; 20 square feet is considered the minimum and makes
for a congested rink. The average total attendance at rinks
in four northeastern cities last season was nearly 70,000.
The Detroit rinks, each of which can accommodate 250 to
300 skaters at one time, served close to 1,000 persons daily
at each rink. Hamtramck reported between 800 and 900
skate-rs per day.

Most public rinks are used essentially for general skating;
in some cases one evening a week is set aside for adults only.
Special periods are scheduled for ice hockey or for figure
skating at one or more rinks.

Added Suggestions

A number of suggestions for rink construction or
operation:

> Provide runways from the skating shelter, so skaters can
reach ice without walking over concrete or earth surfaces.
Heavy duty fabric or rubber belting, three feet wide, has
proved most satisfactory for runways and shelter floors.

) In constructing rink, allow for shrinkage of plastic pipes.

) Set up the refrigeration system so the unit can’t function
unless one of the pumps is operating. Otherwise the brine
might freeze and crack the equipment.

> Run the refrigerant through the system for a couple of
days before starting to build the ice, so as to remove the
heat from the ground and supporting materials.

) Build up the ice slowly by spraying, using a fine nozzle,
so as to secure a solid layer.

> Do not permit ice to become more than two inches thick
above the pipes, or excessive refrigeration will be required
to maintain the ice. (Ice can be used whenll/g-inch thick on
a concrete floor; when 34-inch thick on a sand fill.)

> Plane and clear the ice regularly to keep it smooth and
firm, and use warm water to repair ridges or fill cracks. w

Recreation DeveIOpments in European Cities

A number of observations made on a visit to European

cities have been recorded by Orin F. Nolting, assistant di-
rector of the International City Managers’ Association.
Among those appearing in the May 1955 issue of Public
Management:

European cities on the whole are attractive in spite of their
old buildings and narrow streets. The beauty of some cities
lies in the tree-lined boulevards, parks, and other open
Spaces, fountains, statues, and the absence of the gridiron
plan for streets. . . . Central business areas that were com-
pletely bombed out have been entirely replanned, and one
of the outstanding features is the large amount of open
space.

Public control of land on the fringe of towns also enhances
the attractiveness of the urban area. Kirchheim-Teck, Ger-
many, a city of 22,000 population, owns most of the land
on the fringe of the city, including a range of hills which
is covered with fruit orchards, playfields of various kinds,
and farms owned by the city and leased to farmers.

European cities promote and support cultural activities,
such as symphony orchestras, operas, art galleries, muse-
ums, and so on. Innsbruck, Austria, each year sponsors con-
tests on poetry, dramas, plastic arts, and architecture. Inns-
bruck has a city-owned theater and pays fifty per cent of the
cost of maintenance and of producing plays, Operas, and
dramas. The city also subsidizes a symphony orchestra.

Heidelberg, a city of 120,000 population, spends the
equivalent of a quarter million dollars a year for subsidizing
opera, operettas, orchestras, and a theater. Geneva, Switzer-
land, supports private organizations devoted to art, welfare,
sports, vacation schools, and so on, and the city owns and
operates a large opera building.

Most of the other cities also assist and promote cultural
activities and advise with private organizations on the con-
duct of exhibitions, concerts, festivals, literary and musical
competitions, use of audio-visual material, the erection of
statues, purchase of paintings, and so on. Usually there is a
city department of culture, as in Vienna for example, where
one of the eleven city departments is devoted to culture and
adult education. In Germany the largest cities, as Dussel-
dorf and Frankfort, have special departments of culture.

It is interesting to note that prior to 1948 English cities
had no power to provide cultural facilities other than art
galleries, museums, parks, and recreation grounds, except
such activities as came under the specific heading of “edu-
cation.” Since 1948, however, cities and towns have been
permitted to spend a certain amount each year on entertain-
ment and cultural activities, and Coventry is the first local
authority in England to build, since the end of the war, both
an art gallery and museum and a civic theater.

OCTOBER 1955

Dr. Leo Grebler, associate director of Columbia Univer-
sity’s Institute for Urban" Land Use and Housing Studies,
has also reported on a survey of postwar reconstruction and
planning in twenty-eight European cities, made under a
grant from the Guggenheim Foundation. Dr. Grebler found
that reconstruction planning had one idea in common. It
was to bring a suburban atmosphere into the middle of the
city and move people’s living quarters out to the edge.

“Open Spaces and green areas have replaced what used to
be the most congested prewar slums,” he said. “There is
now more room for recreation and shopping in the center of
rebuilt cities.”

City-School Cooperation in Fort Lauderdale

Within the past year the recreation department in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, initiated the organization of a school-
city coordinating committee for the purpose of coordinating
the planning and development of schools and city parks,
playgrounds and playfields for the use of both city and
school groups. The city is represented on the committee by
the mayor, city manager, superintendent of recreation, su-
perintendent of parks, chairman of the parks and recreation
board, and the chairman of the planning and zoning com-
mission; the” Broward County Board of Public Instruction
is represented by the superintendent of schools, the chair-
man of the board, its financial director, and its supervisor of
maintenance and development.

An excellent working relationship exists between the city
and the schools in that the city recreation department uses
school sites and buildings without charge while the schools
in turn use the city’s swimming pool, ball fields, and tennis
courts for practice, games, and matches.

A recent agreement between the city and county board of
public instruction illustrates an advanced step in coopera-
tive development, planning, and operation of a property for
both school and community recreation use. According to the
agreement the school board rented to the city for one dollar
per year, on a twenty-year basis, a portion of a site at a
school in the city. The board agreed to pay the cost of clear-
ing and grading the playground area, to install a hard-sur-
face multiple court area, and to make other improvements
on the site. The city agreed to develop a lawn area, to con-
struct two softball diamonds, including backstops, and out-
door shelters, to plant trees, provide picnic facilities, and
maintain the playground and recreation area. The agree-
ment provided that development of the grounds be accom-
plished by the city with specific approval of the board. The
entire area is to be under the control of the board during
the hours the school is in session, while during off-school
hours control and use of the area will be under the jurisdic-
tion-of the city. 0

A.A.U. Study of Effect of Athletic Competition

on Girls and Women

A commission appointed by the Amateur Athletic Union
of the United States has issued a report of its study of the
effect of athletic competition on girls and women. Various
aspects of the problem were studied and opinions were se-
cured from a large number of women who have successfully
participated in athletic competitions. The following recom-
mendations were made by the commission in the light of its
inquiry:

1. That the Amateur Athletic Union rules regarding phy-
sical examination, adherence to age classifications, and limi-
tation of amount of participation and type of participation
continue to be enforced in the field of competitive sport for
girls and women.

2. That, insofar as possible, women be used as coaches,
committee members, and executives in all competitive sports
programs for girls and women.

3. That greater cooperation be established and main-
tained with other women’s organizations in the fields of rec-
reation and physical education by mutual inclusion on com-
mittees and by direct assistance on sports programs.

4«. In view of the ever-changing picture in the field of
women’s sport, it is recommended that this commission be-
come a permanent committee of the Amateur Athletic Union
of the United States, and that a revisions committee be ap-
pointed for the sole purpose of keeping this study abreast
of new trends.

* * * *- *-

The December 1954 issue of Research Quarterly reports
a study of physical education interests and needs of 1,155
freshman and s0phomore women at the University of Wash-
ington. It was conducted by Marion R. Broer of the univer-
sity and Dolly A. J. Holland of Everett Junior College. The
findings with respect to preferences for activities should be
of interest to recreation workers.

Students were asked to check the three activities in which
they were interested. The activities checked by the greatest
number were swimming, bowling, tennis, sailing and skiing,
in that order. Students were asked to select six additional
activities in which they were interested, but not as interested
as those chosen first. Tennis, canoeing, badminton, golf,
and bowling, in that order, were chosen by thirty-six per
cent or more. Among the last choice activities, track and

field ranked highest, followed by field hockey.

The ten activities that rank highest in desired instruction,

all levels considered, are tennis, swimming, bowling, skiing,
golf, sailing, diving, riding, badminton and canoeing, in that
order.

As for activities the students reported engaging in out of
school, swimming tops the list with social dancing second.
Bowling; tennis, and skiing were also indicated as highly
popular out-of-school activities.

The principal objectives which the students claimed for
their physical education experience are “to develop skills in
various sports,” “to learn activities that can be continued
outside of school,” “to have fun,” and “to keep in good
health and physical condition.”

Auditorium Rate Structures

The city of Manhattan, Kansas, in preparation for the
opening of its new Memorial Auditorium, conducted a sur-
vey of operating procedures and rates in twenty-nine cities
between ten thousand and forty-five thousand population.
On the basis of the experiences a rate schedule was prepared.

Because of the extreme differences in the size, age, adapt-
ability and type of auditorium facilities in the different
cities, not to mention the extreme variability in the cities’
economies, it was difficult to find a common denominator for
use as a point of departure in determining equitable and
adequate auditorium rates. Cities have apparently sought
to achieve a variety of objectives through their auditorium
charges; some strive to make the auditorium pay for itself
or even make a profit, others simply try to decrease the loss
that is considered inevitable. “

All cities, however, levy the highest set of charges for
primarily commercial activities, a considerably lower set of
rates for events where no admission is charged; other varied
uses are charged rates between these extremes. Daytime
rates are usually lower than evening rates and reductions
are sometimes made for combined daytime and evening use.

The primary factor which apparently influences daytime
charges is operation cost in contrast to cost of depreciation,
construction, as well as operating costs. Ability of the lessor
to pay was often listed as an important consideration. The
experiences of other communities indicated that it would be
difficult, if not impossible, for Manhattan to Operate its audi-
torium without a loss. The table listing base rates in the
twenty—nine cities indicates that the average commercial day-
time rate is $55.00 to $72.00, or 2.8 cents to 3.7 cents per
seat; comparable evening rates are $63.00 to $81.00, or 3.1
cents to 3.7 cents per seat. The average rates when no ado
mission is charged are $25.00 to $30.00 for daytime use, or
$27.00 to $34.00 for an evening period. 0

RECREATION

A sports night (or day) in a public recreation depart- -

ment is nothing unusual. A sports night that features minor
sports, with the dehnite objective of arousing personal inter-
est which will result in participation by those who come to
be entertained, is something else again—and we think this
is an idea worth real consideration.

Paul Stobbe is on the staff of the Detroit Department of
Parks and Recreation. A graduate of Wayne University, he
is also the city. and state handball champion.

ASECOND ANNUAL “Cody All Sports Night” was held on

Wednesday, February 2, 1955, by District V of the.

Detroit Department of Parks and Recreation at the Cody
High School—one of the many schools which the recreation
department uses cooperatively with the Detroit Board of
Education. This is one of many events conducted by the six
districts of the Detroit system. Other programs are held on a
city-wide basis or as part of a recreation center’s or play-
ground’s program. “All Sports Night” had a three-fold pur-
pose. To:

Acquaint the Public with Minor Sports. During the past
two years three thousand spectators have seen exhibitions
lasting from ten to thirty minutes. They have been con-
ducted by renowned athletes such as Norbert Schemansky,
world’s greatest weightlifter; Bill Mihalo, world’s champion
professional walker; Byron Kreiger, Olympic fencer; and
others. Sports covered to date have been walking, the half-
mile run, fencing, weightlifting, table tennis, handball, vol-
leyball, basketball, roller skating, wrestling, ujitsu, fly cast-
ing, and boxing.

miles, everyone performs gratuitously. No rehearsals are
held. Thorough planning, leaving few details to chance,
generous cooperation, and good fortune seem to account for
our successful events.

There is no set way to plan an event of this type, as it will
depend upon location, physical setup, personal contacts, and
the amount of time available. We have held our own events

in a public high school, with its attendant limitations, on the
first Wednesday in February, from 6:30 to 10:00 PM.

A Suggested Plan of Approach

In October—Plan the Program

1. Select the date and time.

2. Select and allot time to the individual sports exhibition.

3. Insert variety non-sport acts for contrast.

4. To sustain audience attention, stagger the inactive ex-
hibitions among the more active ones. .

5. Wherever possible, use your star performers at a time
when most spectators have had a chance to arrive.

6. Select your guest speaker. Last year our guest was
Vince Banonis, one of our great Detroit Lions’ football play-
ers. This year Jim Hay, Dutch Reibel,-and Marcel Bonin,
Red Wing hockey players, thrilled the audience.

In October—Make Your Contacts

1. Obtain definite commitments wherever possible.

2. If commitment is indefinite obtain date when agree-
ment can be reached.

3. Send participants postcards or letters with 'the date,

the place, and the time of the program.
January—First Week

1. Again get in touch with definite participants remind-
ing them of the forthcoming event.

2. Do the same with indefinite prospects.

3. Whip your final program into shape.
January———Second Week

1. Send publicity to neighborhood weekly newspapers.

Usually they are very cooperative. The success of your pro-
gram may be dependent upon the space you receive. «

2. Send notices to all participants regarding the time and
length of your exhibition, map showing location, and other
pertinent information about parking, showers, lockers, and
so on.

3. Undertake promotion via television at this time.
January—Fourth Week °

1. Send publicity to daily papers.

3. Mimeograph programs. They should carry such infor-
mation as: name of exhibition and participant together with
his titles or other information about him, where further in-
formation may be obtained about a particular exhibition,
credits to individuals or organizations. Our regular recrea-
tion schedule at Cody is promoted by having this schedule
appear on the program sheet.

F ebruary—Last Two Days

1. Telephone contestants for final check.

2. Make final check on miscellaneous items: bleachers,
permits, P.A. system, properties, and so on.

3. Check with janitors, volunteer helpers, and so on, for
the last time.

F ebruary—Day of Program

1. Set up equipment, lay out temporary courts.

2. Place volunteer and professional help at their posts.

3. Have performers check in with you upon their arrival
and have them sit together where they can be easily located.

4. Keep tight rein on your timing. Permitting acts be-
yond the allotted time can disrupt your schedule and dis-
courage the other athletes whose time must be shortened.
February—Day After the Program

1. Return properties and ascertain if any damage oc-
curred during the program which requires written reports
to your superiors.

2. Send notes of appreciation to all persons involved.

We are glad to have the opportunity of presenting these
sports to the public. Minor sports do not thrive as easily as

Reports indicate that there are in Burbank approximately
23,761 children and youth in the following age groups: 2749
senior high school age (sixteen to nineteen years old) ; 3902
junior high school age (thirteen to fifteen years old) ; 9913

school age (one to six years old) .

Trick or Treating. To those touring the city on Hallow-
een night it appeared that about eight out of every ten homes
cooperated by lighting front porches, on Halloween night
only. With excellent weather prevailing, and it being Satur-
day night, “Trick or Treating” extended later this year.

Home Parties. Special emphasis was placed on home and
neighborhood parties in a series of newspaper articles cov-
ering party suggestions, games, contests, and food recipes.
A party consultant service was established by the parks and
recreation department.

V. Observations

The children were having fun; and the absence of vandal-
ism on Halloween night may be largely attributed to:
o The awareness of the entire community to a common
challenge.
0 The enthusiastic participation of hundreds of citizens,
organizations, and city officials in the early planning and
conducting of a city-wide program. 
0 Designing a Halloween program of many parties stra-
tegically located throughout the city, thus kebping children
busy, off the streets, and in their own neighborhoods.

VI. Remarks of Burbank Citizens
Burbank Review: “Mischief muzzled—park parties hold

pranks on Halloween to minimum.”

Chief of Police Rex Andrews: “We had very little trouble

and the Halloween committee deserves much credit. . . .”

A. L. Rediger, president, Burbank Chamber of Com-
merce: “It was a pleasure to . . . note the tremendous interest
of adults in carrying out this splendid program. National
records bear out the fact that youths under proper guidance
and leadership are non-destructive and a definite asset to
any community. I believe there are no problem youth but
that there are many youths with problems.” - '-

Vice-Mayor Earl C. Blais: “The citizens and organizations
of this city are to be commended on the wonderful manner
in which everyone cooperated to support this most success-
ful community project.” 0

A DRUM and BUGLE CORPS

for Neuropsychiatric Hospital Patients

URINC THE PAST few years the drum and bugle corps has
proved to be a tremendous factor in stimulating com-
munity pride, competition, and general interest in belong-
ing to an organized musical group. This is also true of this
activity in ncuropsychiatric hospitals, and, in addition, mu-
sical participation carries treatment value and therapeutic
benefit.

The organization and development of such a unit is being
successfully conducted at the St. Cloud Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital in Minnesota. This neuropsychiatric hos-
pital is a 1,379 bed treatment hospital which maintains a
full-time music program.

During the winter months a survey is taken of patients
interested in active participation, and a record is kept of
their age, length of hospitalization, interests, hobbies, diag-
nosis, and present condition, with the idea that their par-
ticipation is voluntary as far as feasible in keeping with the
medical prescription. This information is submitted to the
medical staff, and they, in turn, determine which patients
will be assigned to the drum and bugle corps. Prescription
to participate in this music activity takes preference over all
others except medical appointments. Periodic reports are
submitted to the medical staff by the music director to es-
tablish the patient's progress in relation to his ability to get
along with others, how well he is learning, and other ele-
ments pertaining to his adjustment to hospital treatment.

From an objective standpoint, the organization of such a
group activity enables the medical staff member to observe
and evaluate the progress of his patient. The drum and bugle

corps is an excellent means of re-socialization. Each mem-
ber learns that cooperative effort, taking commands, compe-
tition, and friendly interpersonal relationships are all im-
portant to the success of the unit. When patients realize
this, they are likely to transfer this learning by applying it
to other things they do.

Members of the corps are genuinely interested in it, and
ask about the plans for next season, and whether they will
be able to play again. They talk to their friends about the
parades they have been in and arouse the interest of other
patients.

Mr. “X,” a privileged ward patient who loves music but
cannot play any instrument, was so enthusiastic about be-
coming a member that he took a pair of drum sticks and
practiced everywhere he went. He is active in sports, takes
care of the golf putting greens, helps with work on the ward,
but he finds time to practice. He had trouble learning, but
whenever he came to ask me something, whether I was in

“the music room or not, he’d find me. He is making steady

progress and is now one of, our best drummers. This kind
of enthusiasm is good, and it is interesting to note that this
patient has been hospitalized since 1937 and has a diag-
nosis of manic type, manic-depressive reaction with assault-
ive tendency. He is getting along well with others now,
and has not shown any assaultive tendency thus far. He will
be a member again this year, and as a result of his membcr-
ship he has been responsible for recruiting three ncw mem-
bers and finding one man who playcd a drum fifteen ycars

years old and as spry as anyone twenty years younger.
The period of intensive training for the corps begins the

second or third week in April and continues for about six

RECREATION

weeks. During this period two or three sectional rehearsals
and three full-corps rehearsals are held each week. Extra
help and encouragement is given to those who need it so that
they Can keep pace with the others.

The rehearsal schedule begins with two weeks of basic
rudiments in drumming and bugling. Time is devoted to.
the theory of organization, discussion of maneuvers, music
reading,'and general orientation as to what is expected of
each member during his membership. Definite rules are set
up for conduct and behavior in such a way that teamwork
is stressed. We have had no behavior problems in any corps
activity for the past four years.

A new drum and bugle corps is organized each session
because the turnover of membership is so great that only
about twenty per cent of the previous season’s membership
remain for the next season. Our records indicate that be-
tween fifty and sixty per cent of the new season’s roster of
patients do not complete the season’s activities, and twenty-
five per cent are discharged, sent on trial visit, or are trans-
ferred before the first parade.

At the beginning of the training season, more than half of
our members are closed-ward patients. The majority of
these are transferred to an open or privileged ward before
the end of drum and bugle corps season.

Mr. “P,” a closed-ward patient, was not interested in any
hospital activity, didn’t want to go to a shop, refused to take
a shower, didn’t talk much, and was generally unc00pera-
tive. He did not have any training or experience in music,
but was asked several times whether he would be interested
in playing a snare drum or bugle. He finally consented to
try it, and after a lot of concentration and encouragement,
he began to improve. He became more alert, began to as-
sociate with other patients, and became more cooperative,
He progressed steadily in his hOSpital adjustment and also
became a good drummer. Soon after he became a regular
member, he was transferred to a privileged ward and has
remained there. He may be up for release soon.

The members of the drum and bugle corps from the previ-
ous year are used to form a nucleus, and they assist in the
instruction and training of the new members. After the new
members are well on their way, these former members begin
study on the alternate instrument, drum or bugle. There-
fore, there are a number of members who are versatile
enough to insure correct balance of instrumentation.

The bugle section begins its study with the mouthpiece.
A bugle is assigned to each member, and the rudiments of
playing and handling the instrument during performances
are practiced.

The drummers begin their training by studying the cor-
rect method of holding the sticks, beating, the 'triple and
double beat, timing, and accent. Those who experience dif-
ficulty with any of the beats, use their hands to beat out the
rhythm. The street-beats, the roll-off, drum accompaniment
to the bugle calls, and the parade routine are introduced step

by step, going from the known to the unknown in an orderly
manner. During this time the training and performance com-
mands are introduced, and most rehearsals are conducted
through this media because it saves time and helps to pro-
duce a unit well disciplined in performance.

OCTOBER 1955

Following the basic rudiments, the corps is rehearsed in
close-order drill using regulation army commands to under-
go several transitions: 0pen-rank drill, marching with in-
struments (not playing), standing in formation and playing
the parade routine by whistle-baton commands, and, finally,
marching and playing.

The unit is now ready for parade rehearsal. The time in-
volved in “putting together” the drum and bugle corps will
vary slightly according to the general ability of the group.
The outdoor marching periods are arranged to condition
these men to a two-mile parade. Several members are over
fifty years old and we have not had a drop-out at any parade
for the past four years.

The flag squad is composed of three flag men and four
guards. This unit is not organized until after the first two
weeks of drum and bugle training. These men are then
trained in the army manual-of-arms and one patient, who
acts as squad leader, gives the commands. Leadership is on
a rotational basis.

From now on the entire marching unit rehearses together.
Rank formations, taking whistle-baton commands, tempo of
cadence, turns, maneuvers, care of instruments, tuning of
drums, inspection procedure are all thorOUghly rehearsed.
The last four rehearsals are devoted to polishing up the per-
formance, general instruction in parade routine, conduct,
rules governing the judging of a marching unit, so that each
member may enter a parade in full confidence. The patients
begin to feel and show a stronger sense of belonging, and
this added touch has paid off in competitive marching. They
have won a first and a second place position in three com-
petitive parades during the past two years.

Parade Performance

The first parade of the season is a double-performance
day, marching in the hOSpital Memorial Day parade and in
the local St. Cloud civic Memorial Day parade, as illustrated
in the photograph on the Opposite page. The parade-per-
formance period represents a period of continued rehearsal
on a sustaining basis, and the performance of the drum
corps in about seven or eight off-station parades.

The corps is invited to perform in local parades and cele-
brations, and the expenses of these trips are paid by the in-
viting community. Occasionally a local service organization
will sponsor and supplement the expenses involved in a trip
when the normal allowances will not cover meals.

The members of the drum and bugle corps really look
forward to these parades; the anticipation they build up is
marvelous. They love and respect their uniform. We want
them to gain confidence in themselves, to give them a sense
of satisfaction in performing for others, and to allow them
to perform under normal circumstances in a competitive
spirit—win or lose. The result of all this effort has been a
display of “esprit de corps” which is seldom seen in any kind
of patient activity. We try to avoid every bit _of embar-
rassment to the patient and the hospital during any parade.
Therefore, we ask that no public announcement be made to
the effect that the corps is from a mental hospital. Members
do not want sympathy, but, rather, they want to be recog-
nized on the merit of their performance. 0

CODEBALL-

 

“Dr. Code, why don’t you develop a game for the masses
that will be as popular as golf is for the classes?” asked the
late Anton Cermak, mayor of Chicago. This was the chal-
lenge that set sportsman Dr. William E. Code, _a successful
Chicago physician, to work.

He wanted to deve10p an activity that could be played by
all ages and both sexes. It had to be inexpensive. If space
used for other sports could be utilized that would reduce the

cost. It should be playable all seasons of the year and in all
parts of the country.

Dr. Code found that ideas developed best while experi-
menting. He tried golf with a single club and a larger ball——
one club was less expensive and the larger ball was not
easily lost. Being a physician he conceived of the new game
in terms of movement that would call into play the large
muscle groups of the body and thus be therapeutically bene-
ficial to the participants. If large numbers of people of all
ages and both sexes were to be attracted, the game could not
be complicated, yet should have an appeal that would chal-
lenge skill development. He traced the origin and develop-
ment of other sports such as basketball, volleyball, bowling,
tennis, handball, squash racquets, table tennis, badminton,
swimming strokes, water polo, and others; each had its good
points as well as its limitations.

After considerable testing and rejecting of various types
of activities he decided he needed two games: one an indoor
game that demanded the speed, stamina, and skill of a train-
ed athlete, and another game for outdoor play that would
serve the masses in which he and his friend Mayor Cermak
were deeply interested. Using his own name as a reminder
to the mayor that the challenge had resulted in a concrete
activity he called the indoor game, “Codeball-in-the-Court,”
(kicking “handball”), and the outdoor game, “Codeball-
on-the-Green,” (kicking “golf”) .

For both games he used a pneumatic rubber ball that
could withstand an outside pressure of six hundred pounds
before it would collapse. This ball was lively and durable

and cost about fifty cents (because the good doctor himself
absorbed the initial cost of developing the equipment needed

to manufacture the ball). Consultations were carried on with
recreation people, park departments, schools and colleges,
YMCA’s, summer camps, athletic clubs, veterans hospitals,
and industries. During this period of experimentation the
concept of a hole in the ground into which the ball could be
footed was changed, upon the recommendation of Avery
Brundage, now president of the International Olympic Com-
mittee, to a cone-shaped bowl that could be shifted easily.

During the November 1929 F orty-First Annual Amateur
Athletic Union Convention held in St. Louis, the games of
Codeball-in-the-Court and Codeball-on-the-Green were pre-
sented and adOpted as official A.A.U. sports. Rules for both
games were published, and are distributed through the na-
tional A.A.U. office.*

Briefly described, the indoor game, Codeball-in-the-Court,
is much like handball except that it is played with the feet
in a standard four-wall enclosed handball court. Unlike
handball the ball may be kicked on the second bounce, may
be returned by kicking it into the rear'wall, or may be “set-
up” on the flrst kick and then played to the front wall.

The outdoor game, Codeball-on-the-Green, makes use of
the same ball: white rubber, six inches in diameter and twelve

ounces in weight. Play usually occurs in foursomes, and
each player’s ball is identified by a number of one to four
or by a color dot of red, blue, black, or green. (In winter a
red ball that shows up distinctly against the snow is used.)
The game is played in an outdoor area of from three to ten
acres (field, campus, or golf course) on which seven or '
fourteen aluminum bowls are distributed. The bowls are
forty-one inches in diameter at the base, rise cone-shaped
seven inches from the turf to an opening eighteen inches in
diameter. The bowls are identified by large numbers or by
numbered flagpoles. Depending upon the space available the
bowls are laid out to permit distances of from thirty to three

hundred yards from each kick-off to bowl. This affords di-

versity to the number of kicks required.

Six years after the ofiicial sanction of the game, Time
magazine in its July 1, 1935 issue reported on the first United
States Codeball-on-the-Green championship won by Bert
Gates at Forest Park, St. Louis. It was estimated that 50,000
persons had become competent players by that time. Played
in playgrounds and parks, summer camps, on college cam-
puses, at veterans hospitals, C.C.C. camps, and used widely
at industrial, church, and luncheon club picnics, the game
had become well established.

Came the war, and rubber and aluminum were used for
war purposes. Because of the values of the games, a commit-
tee organization was continued through the A.A.U. An ap-
peal was made to the late Alex Taylor to help in securing
equipment that met rule specifications. Experimentation
was carried on with plastic, fiberglass, aluminum, steel
sheets, and bowls made of galvanized steel rods welded to
metal hoops. Bowls made of woven rattan reeds were de-
veloped in Mexico, South America, the Philippines, and in
Japan. Rubber balls were manufactured in England.

Promotional Hiers, playing rules, articles, and reports were
prepared. Demonstrations were put on. Talks were made
about the values of the games. Persons who ordinarily watch
physical recreation were intrigued by the game with a kick,
and while they came to watch they stayed to play.

Family groups with small yards purchase a single bowl
and four balls, and by setting up kick-oils in different loca-
tions, play into the one bowl and get the satisfaction that
comes from family or neighborhood recreation.

With mass production methods and new inexpensive ma-
terials, Codeball is destined to become the low cost widely
popular recreation its inventor visualized twenty-six years
ago when he said, “Here it is—the game with a kick.” C

ball-on- the-

Studying Your Community

Roland L. Warren. Russell Sage
Foundation, 505 Park Avenue, New
York 22. Pp.385. $3.00.

In this volume Professor Warren has
prepared a worthy successor to earlier
publications issued by the Russell Sage
Foundation dealing with community
surveys. It is “a working manual for
people who are interested in studying
their own community in one or all of its
aspects. It is designed for the layman,
but may be of help also to professional
people, particularly in those aspects of
the community not directly within their
field of professional competence.”

Written in informal style, the book
contains a vast fund of useful informa-
tion. Many of the chapters deal with
particular aspects of community life.
Others treat the general subject of com1
munity organizations and methods of
conducting surveys.

Readers of RECREATION will lind
much that is familiar in the recreation
chapter, especially the section relating
to public recreation, for to a consider-
able degree the material is drawn from
publications of the National Recreation
Association. They may be surprised to
read, however, that “in scarcely any
field of community endeavor is there
such general agreement on detail stand-
ards as in the public recreation field.”

Many specific and practical sugges-
tions are offered for things an indi-
vidual or organization can do to help
develop a recreation program in a com-
munity. The sixty-four questions listed
for study or suggested action give evi-
dence of a wide familiarity with com-
munity recreation problems and proce-
dures. An exception might be the impli-
cation that recreation commissions are
composed primarily of government Olli-
cials rather than of lay citizens, as is
usually the case.

Recreation leaders will find useful the
many references to the relation of recre-
ation to other phases of community life.

Amongthe most useful features of the

book are the practical guides for con-
ducting a survey and the comprehen-
sive list of national agencies concerned
with various aspects of community life.
-—Ceorge D. Butler, Director of the
NRA Research Department.

Covering the Leisure-time Field

Major Sports Techniques

Ethan Allen, Jim Moore, Forrest An-
derson and Don Canham. A. S. Barnes
& Company, 332 Madison Avenue,
New York 16. Pp. 438. $5.00.*

The fundamental techniques of five
major sports are analyzed and illus-
trated with very effective action draw-
ings in this master volume. Each sport
is covered by a well-recognized coach
who tells how to select and use equip-
ment, how to train and practice, how to
build skills. This book should be of
special interest to coaches, athletes,
sports fans.

Philosophy of Recreation
and Leisure

Jay B. Nash. C. V. Mosby Company,
St. Louis. $3.50.*

This is not just another book on rec-
reation but a book on life, with a phi-
losophy taken from rich life experiences
as practiced and proved by the author.
Its scope is youth to old age; its theme,
recreation through which moves man,
aspiring, eXperimenting, accepting, dis-
carding, but always seeking. The prog-
ress of man is measured by the chal-
lenges accepted. The problems of the
use of leisure are discussed, each chap-
ter carrying a different theme.

Leisure is a gift from the achieve-
ments of the past, a part of gracious liv-
ing, made up of precious moments of
expanding life.

Man, by his inventive genius, has
placed himself in a cage of his own
making. He has created servants who
can rob him of his most precious qual-
ity, initiative. And, according to Dr.
Nash, happiness and the will-to-Iive re-
sult from active participation.

Future civilizations will be judged by
the quality of their recreation, creative
or passive.

The chapter, “Retire and Live,” a
timely subject, is excellent; while the
last chapter vividly describes the pattern
man may follow to successful living or

'to mediocre existence.

This book should be read carefully

by every educator and recreation di-
rector in the country. It is thought-

provoking and inspiring. Don’t over-
look the Epilogue.—Crant D. Brandon,
for many years superintendent of rec-
reation in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Basic Principles of
Parliamentary Law and Protocol

Marguerite Grumme. 3830 Hum-_
phrey Street, St. Louis 16, Missouri. Pp.
68. $1.00 single copy; $5.50 for six,-
$10.00 for twelve.

Here is a very helpful guide for those
who must give time to planning or at-
tending group meetings. The section on
parliamentary law, based on Robert’s
Rules of Order, gets right down to the
basic principles in condensed form and
answers most questions one would have
about parliamentary proprieties in a
meetlng. .

The section on basic protocol is
equally valuable. It sets forth in simple
terms the proper procedures and cour-
tesies that should apply in the planning
and conduct of general meetings, guest
meetings, dinners, conferences, and con-
ventions. Questions relating to presi-
dential, officer, and member protocol
are covered in detail.

For the group leader this pocket size
manual eliminates guesswork in the ob-
servance of the proprieties of rank and
occasion. If it were studied by recrea-
tion officials and group workers every-
where, how smoothly the wheels of each
meeting would runI—Ceorge Nesbitt,
Director of the NRA Correspondence
and Consultation Service.

When the gun failed,

HE LEARNED acting the hard way, barn-
storming frontier towns (Chicago, pop.
2,000), traveling by barge and stagecoach,
playing in sheds, courthouses, taverns.

One night in Houston, a Texan even sug-
gested the troupe tour through Indian coun-
try, carrying their stage weapons for pro-
tection. Joe Jefferson declined. He later said
he had shivered when he imagined himself
facing a hostile Indian and armed only with
a stage pistol whose tendency to misfire had
several times “compelled our heavy villain
to commit suicide with a tablespoon.”

By the 1860’s, Jefferson was America’s
favorite actor. When he played his famous
Rip Van Winkle (see picture), “one-night”
towns declared a “Jefferson Holiday.” Busi-
ness stopped, schools closed, so that every-
one would get a chance to see him act.

They loved Joe Jefferson everywhere for
his genius at making people happy. And his
sunny outlook still sparkles in the spirit of
America. Like Joe Jefferson, Americans still
know how to travel a hard road to reach
their goals, how to smile when the goings
roughest. '

These confident Americans are the real
wealth of our nation. And they are the real
reason why our country’s Savings Bonds
rank among the world’s finest investments.

That’s why, to save for your goals in life,
you cannot find a surer, safer way than
United States Savings Bonds. Invest in them
regularly—and hold onto them!
