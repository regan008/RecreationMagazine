Controversial?
Sirs:

These days, on TV, we hear many
discussions among cducators regarding
school functions and what they are try-
ing to teach our youth. One of the many
criticisms heard seems to be that schools
are giving too much time to instruction
in recreation activities, such as casting
and dancing, and so forth.

Therc are many who feel recrca-
tion activities should he takcn away
from thc school systems and given back
to the communities as a department.
to function the same as the other public
services of any given community, so the
children may have the benefit of learn-
ing or participating in rccrcation activi-
ties after school hours, giving thcm
more time for study while in school. If
this criticism bccomcs louder and loud-
er. as it appears it will, just where will
this leave the recreation worker now in
the schools in communities that have no
alternate program to which he can go?

I would like to hear thc reaction of
some of the directors on this.

Private Swimming Pools
Sirs:

I am not sure what brought forth
Mr. Hoffman’s comment that the Amer-
ican Society of Planning Officials is not
an appropriate agency to be interested
in swimming pools [RECREATi0N. June
1958, page 183]. I suppose that straight
reporting of what is happening can be
interpreted as “trying to get into the
act of regulating swimming pools,” al-
though it scems to me to be stretching
it a point. Also, we are not the “latest
group” but probably one of the earliest
to recognize this land use as a new
urban problem.

Early in 1954, we sensed from ques-

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

—-The Editors.

tions coming from our members, that
thc backyard swimming pool was about
to break out all over the face of the
urban landscape and that it might intro-
duce some problems involving location,
safety, and assorted control measures.
We set to work to assemble all thc infor-
motion we could find on residential
swimming pools, which was not too
much since, at that time, they were still
gcnerally reserved as the toys of mil-
lionaires and movie stars. We consulted
the “swimming pool industry” (Mr.
IIomean’s termI , insurance companies,
public health organizations, and so on.

We worked the information into a
report, “Private Swimming Pools and
Clubs,” which we scnt to our mcmbers
in August, 1954. It was well receivcd,
and proved uscful since it was the only
study that tackled the backyard pool
from the viewpoint of the public in—
tercst.

There are many problems, many col-
laterial effects, that must be studied
whenever a new land use is introduced
into our cities. The private swimming
pool, by virtue of its ubiquity (it is
fast replacing at least the third car in
the family, if not the second car) does
constitute a new land use. There is
always a shakedown period in which
cities and experts try to solve the prob-
lem of learning how to live with each
new land use. We have had it with
drive-in theaters, with motels, with
shopping centers, with trailer parks,
with marinas, and so on. . . .

The problems of the backyard swim-
ming pool are beginning to be ironed
out, but they are not all solved. For
example, recently we had an inquiry
from one city in which a deveIOper pro-
posed to put in a “private club” swim-
ming pool in the center of a block on
a half acre of land, to serve fifty families

in the block. The difficulties that such

a pr0posal brings up are not all ones

eustomarily within the pnrvie v of san-
itary engineers or public health agen-
cies.

lneidentally, I am more than a liltlc
fascinated by the idea of a “competition
for the best . . . legislation” on swim-
ming pool regulation, which Mr. llolT-
man reports his magazine is sponsoring.
This scheme offers a lot of possibilities
and eventually might replace such old-
fashioned things as attorneys, eity
eouneils, state legislatures, and even——
perhaps—the Congress of the United
States.

Up to Now

and From Here on Out

“Let us re-examine and reaffirm what recreation stands for . . .”

EVERY CITIZEN, individually, as well
as in his family group or com-
munity, has or should have, the same
kind of concern for good recreation
that he has for good health, good edu-
cation, and the general welfare. It is
interesting to recall some of the events
and cultural concepts that have influ-
enced recreation in America up to
now. They provide the backdrop
against which to consider three chal-
lenges to the recreation profession today: the challenge of
insight, the challenge of upsurge, the challenge of outreach.

In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the
English pe0p|e were recreation minded. It was the golden
age of playwriting and theatcr going, a great period in
music. Trevelyan reminds us that it was not primarily the
music of the concert hall, but of the home and community
in the singing of madrigals—the popular songs of the day.

There were many games and amusements. The church-
yard itself was frequently used as a kind of public park for
outdoor sports on a Sunday afternoon. The pastimes of the
upper classes were often frivolous, and, by our modern
standards, grossly immoral. It was a time of Puritan revolt,
based, in part, on opposition to the flagrant usc of leisure
time by the rich and wellborn. Macaulay writes of the
Puritans: “It was considered a sin to hang garlands on a
Maypole, to drink a friend’s health, to fly a hawk, to play
at chess. . . .” Is it any wonder that this stern Puritan
tradition, when transplanted to the New England colonies,
discouraged amusements of all kinds?

Occasional voices spoke out for leisure and recreation,
of whom Benjamin Franklin was one. Useful leisure, to
Franklin, included reading, language study, and the found-
ing of a public library in Philadelphia.

In coming to the nineteenth century we may observe that
if recreation were no longer condemned as ungodly, it often
appeared to be uneconomical and wasteful. Remember that

 

 

MR. SNYDER, Defense Coordinator, Office of the Secretary,
U. S. Department of Heaith, Education and lVeifare, was
Deputy Commissioner for S peciai Services and Deputy to the
Director of Community War Services, which inciuded federai
wartime recreation programs during Worid War II. This ma-
teriai is condensed from a speech given at the 1958 Annuai
Conference of the Virginia State Recreation Society and the
Vermont Annttai Governor’s Conference on Recreation.

Dean AtIec Snyder

the average workweek was seventy hours or more. And yet
there were significant developments: organized sports and
gylnastics, church picnics and county fairs, minstrel shows,
and the unique lyceum lecture. Social visiting was in great
vogue, as were dancing, card playing, and singing.

In rural sections building a house or barn provided rec-
reation for all one’s neighbors; “raising the roof” was great
fun. Frontier sports were of the rough and ready type, but
even an early river community like Cincinnati had a muse-
um, a picture gallery, an academy of fine arts, and a socicty
for the study of phrenology.

Thcre is not time, here, to continuc our rapid historical
sketch into the present century, but most of us are well
aware of recent developments, particularly those which
followed World Wars I and II. The present activities of the
National Park Scrvice and similar state agencies are famil-
iar to us. The growth of state recreation commissions and
of municipal departments is a promising indication of public
awarcness and public support. Greater things lie ahead.

The March of Ideas

We now turn from the march of events to the march of
ideas. Certain attitudes that influcnced recreation in times
past have already bcen noted, but there is another needing
attention. It relates to the philosophy of two great Virgin-
ians—Ceorge Mason and Thomas Jefferson—the concept
known as “the pursuit of happiness.”

This is one of the best known phrases in our historieal
vocabulary. It is one of the inalienablc rights set forth in
the Declaration of Independence and has been incorporated
into many state constitutions. The ideal survives.

In his recent lectures at the University of Michigan, writer
and critic Howard Mumford Jones pointed out that modern
man is contentedly pursuing happiness all over the place;
that deepite our tensions and frustrations, America is a land
of good cheer. Is there any doubt about it? Thcre are all
manner of indications. We have Optimists Clubs for the
men, and SorOptimists for the ladies. Annually, on January
1, little Mr. New Year happily kicks out old Mr. Gloom.
We write songs about “I want to be happy, but I won’t be
happy until you’re happy, too.’

In this happy land in which recreation leaders organize
and supervise, leisure brings pleasure and satisfaction while
income-producing labor is often a repetitive bore. This is
part of the price men pay for the supplanting of personal

RECREATION

craftsmanship by the machine. How different from the old
belief that there was discomfort in idleness and solid satis-
faction in hard work.

Today’s Challenge

What do these facts of life mean to the recreation worker?
This begins to get personal. May I challenge you in three
ways?

First, the challenge of insight. This means knowing
what’s going on and putting things in perspective. That is
why study, reflection, and adaptation are so important to
your growing profession. Insight will help you understand
that your profession is more than a vocational association,
that it is concerned with more than games and whistle blow-
ing, or playground supervision, or the administration of
staff. Qualities of intellect and statesmanship are also
required.

Insight will make you aware of the unique and voluntary
character of recreation, or, to use the small boy's defini-
tion, “What you do when you don’t have to.” Recreation
can be guided but not regimentcd. In this area of free choice
your clients enjoy the right to be wrong. Nevertheless you
are performing service of inestimable value as you pursue
what David Riesman describes as the new role of “avoca-
tional counseling.”
ions such as yours.

Second, the challenge of upsurge. Frankly, I’m less in-
tercsted in the statistics of the shorter workweek, increased
man-hour production, and so on than in what people are
actually doing. The evidence amazes me: there are thirty-
four million amateur photographers; eighteen million ama-
teur fishermen; eighteen million home gardeners; twenty
million bowlers; twenty million table-tennis players; seven-
teen million roller skaters; five million horseshoe players.
Over two thousand amateur theater groups put on nearly ten
thousand plays each year. Golf (formerly played only at
country clubs by the well-to-do) now attracts four million
persons at all income levels. '

Do-it-yourself workshops, as a hobby, account for sixty
million dollars annually. Thirty million persons participate
in recreation boating (6,500,000 pleasure craft); two and
a half million (double the number five years ago) collect
coins as a hobby. Twenty-five billion dollars annually are
spent by Americans for vacation and holiday travel.

Some significant ten-year comparisons based on defining
as participants thosc who engage in an activity at least two
or more times during the year: tent and trail camping—
 p 250 per cent; archery—up 170 per cent; golf—up 19 per
cent. The sale of artists’ supplies has increased 500 per cent
° cc World War II, and an estimated two million persons
now enjoy amateur painting, among them, of course, Wins-
ton Churchill and President Eisenhower.

Let’s take a look at music. Twice as many people (twenty-
éight million, including eight million children) play musi-
cal instruments as did twenty years ago; sales of electronic
d chord organs up 600 per cent in five years; hi-fi grow-
ing by leaps and bounds—already a multimillion dollar bus-
' as; 703 home-grown opera groups in forty-eight states;

  
   
  

This I take to mean emerging profes-

     
  
 
   
    
  

mum? 1959

one thousand amateur symphony orchestras in American
communities; thirty thousand high-school orchestras and
twenty thousand bands; more money now spent annually
on concert music than on baseball admissions; seventy-five
major music organizations with a combined membership
of more than one million.

This is more than an upsurge; it’s what Life Magazine
calls a “cultural explosion.” It’s a bear by the tail, and the
professional recreator can’t let go.

A

Commmunity recreation under organized public auspices
is only part of the reason for this. Advertisers and the mass
communication media have also had a lot to do with it,
creating and stimulating recreation desires and leisure-time
tastes. Then the private associations and organizations pro-
vide all manner of recreation services for their members.

The challenge of upsurge requires the working together
of many groups on the community level with an enlarged
spirit of mutual recognition and support. This involves pub-
lic agencies, private associations, commercial enterprises,
and let’s not forget just-plain-John Citizen, who may never
set foot in a recreation building or join the Association. of
Amateur Chefs, and yet who may preside over the finest
outdoor barbecue in his entire neighborhood.

Finally, the challenge of outreach. It is no figure of
speech to say that we are now reaching for the moon.
Sputnik has stirred us up to face some stern realities. The
temper of the people may be changing. Suspend the fancy
frills in education; emphasize only science and math was
the first cry. Satellites we must have, so maybe health, wel-
fare, recreation, and other community services can be cut
back to help pay the cost.

Rediscover the fun of working hard, says a leading scien-
tist in a newspaper interview. Americans are too soft, says
another headline. A congressional committee gets dis-
turbed because public money is spent for swimming pools
at overseas airbases.

Does all this mean that recreation is a badge of weakness?
1 don’t think so, nor do you, but how about some other
people? We are still too apologetic for recreation in Amer-
iea. Possibly we are ovcrcautious lest we be regarded as
dabblers, dilettantes, and playboys. Are we also subconsci~
ously worried about not being forever “up and doing. . . .”

This is a time to shake off latent guilt feelings if they
exist; to re-examine and reaffirm what recreation stands
for; and to create a new public awareness of its positive
values. The great need is to convince and win over those
who fancy themselves tough-minded, but who unknowingly
may also be a little shortsighted. This kind of public
relations won’t be easy, but it’s necessary.

Let’s face it. Times are uncertain; tensions exist: but
mathematics, music, and national defense are in this thing
together. Science and recreation can coexist; in fact, they
must.

If it hadn’t been for the emotional release provided by

7

playing his violin, Einstein might have cracked up under
the extreme pressures_ of his work. Josef Hofmann, the great
pianist, was also a successful inventor. Winston Churchill
took up painting at the age of forty—this, in 1915, while
Britain was at war. Did this make him soft, less able as a
statesman? Far from it. Recently, he said, “If it weren’t
for painting, I couldn’t bear the strain of things.

The four-(lay week will mean more
camping. State parks will need more
acreage, stretches of safe lake and river
shores, not too far from the city.

RECREATION
Ten Years

in the
Future

Let us look ahead a decade at the beginning of this New Year,

and consider the predictions of a group of national
leaders in the recreation field:

ECREATION ten years from 110w will be greatly different

from what it is today. Perhaps the most dramatic
change will bc that there will bc so much more of it. The
four-day week will be an actuality for many, and three-day
weekends, the rule. If—and this, as wc shall see, is a vcry
big if—if we start now to prepare for the onslaught of all
this free time, we will have the healthiest, most creative
civilization evcr known. Our expanding leisurc will give all
of us a chance for things we always wanted but for which
we never had time. Everyone will have the fun of exploring
new fields; experts will be on hand to provide help, new
ideas, and the necessary leadership.

All of this will require more space and an incrcase in
operating funds. Therefore, we may expect thc present park
aud recreation standard of ten acres per thousand popula-
tion to increase to twentyiacrcs per thousand. It is quitc
probable that at least one city in four will rcach this in-
crcase by means of careful long-range planning.

There are many cities currently spending over six dollars
per capita, for combined operation purposes. Presumably
in ten years, if we keep pace with the needs of our citizens,
we may expect standards to bc between ten to fifteen dol-
lars and actual per capita spending between eight to ten

dollars. Changes in living patterns resulting from scien-

tific advances, automation, and nuclear power development
will give people everywhere more freedom, more money to
spend, more time to meditate, and more time to live. Life
in the future can become far more interesting and purpose-
ful—“provided we help people to learn early in childhood
some constructive use of increased leisure.

We can expect increasing urban congestion to force acqui-
sition and development of a greater amount of park and

recreation arcas and facilities. This will not come about,
howcver, without a unified effort on the part of park and
rccreation professionals working cooperatively and unsel-
fishly with city officials, school authorities, and lay citizen
groups. lf there is any lag in this progress, informed citi-
zens may force some “professional weddings.”

City ordinances and state legislation will be revised and
changed to allow park and recreation authorities to offer
fringe areas the same direct service as citizens within city
limits. The fringe-area rcsident will bc forced to “pay-as-
you-play” and carry his proportionate share of the services
used. Builders will bc convinced that a playground in the
center of the subdivision will assure the sale of all lots
within a reasonably short period of time, at a price higher
than originally contcmplated. Consolidated municipal and
metropolitan park and recreation developmcnt will show
a greater increase rather than their separate development.

State park dcpartments will attempt to increase their
total acreage by twcnty-five per cent, acquiring and main-
taining forcst areas, vast stretches of lake shores, river
banks, and rolling green belts near cities and other clusters
of population within each state. The newly constructed and
proposed development of state and federal highways will
open up vast new areas of public lands heretofore un-
dreamed of, for roadside camping, picnicking, fishing, out-
door education, and family recreation.

It is safe to predict that within the next ten years, twenty
thousand additional new recreation leaders will be needed
to fill newly created jobs and take care of replacements,
primarily in government agencies. In addition, voluntary
youth-serving organizations and private organizations may
need another fifteen to twenty thousand leaders.

At the present rate of production, our professional train-
ing schools will simultaneously graduate approximately

RECREATION

 

five thousand professional recreation students. The gap is
obvious, indicating a shortage of some fifteen thousand
for government agencies alone. The situation is even more
serious than the figures indicate. For instance, it is antici-
pated that we may not induct more than fifty per cent of the
recreation graduates into the field. Many are lost tempo-
rarily and permanently to the military. Young women
graduates are lost to marriage.

Proper recognition of recreation is in the offing and, in
the next ten years, it will take its rightful place alongside
of edneation' and health. Certification of recreation people
will become common in most states. The amount of pro-
fessional preparation required of persons entering the field
will be quite similar to that now required of persons enter-
ing teaching. Since recruitment of recreation personnel is
lagging, and may become even more difficult, allied fields,
such as psychology, political science, and sociology, will

take a more active interest in problems of leisure and rec-
rcation.

In the next ten years there will be:
0 An expansion of the citizen’s recreation environment on
land, on sea, in the air, and even outer space.
0 New and complex hobby equipment and increased de-
pendence upon the public domain for exercise of these
hobbies.
0 Expanding industries, involving large investments, ca-
tering to hobbies and other recreation activities.
0 The terms “enriching” and “constructive” will be even
more applicable to public recreation programs than they
are today.

0 Definite expansion in the use of state and‘natural forests,

for day camping and family camping by city recreation
departments.

0 Recreation is a relatively new profession and, in many
communities, it is just beginning to be accepted. We’ll
need to “sell horizons.” We have the opportunity to win
friends and citizen support.

0 Need for safer and cleaner lakes, rivers and streams, for
increased activity in aquatics of all kinds, for more docks
and marinas to accommodate local and transient boat
owners.

0 lncreasing emphasis on cultural advancement and the
performing arts, with greater demand for more highly spe-
cialized programs in music, dance, arts and crafts, and
drama.

0 A growing number of advisory services as compared with
direct department services.

0 More mobile services to outlying areas to handle urban
sprawl; more trailer-court programs for older adults; and
more preretiremcnt counseling and training.

0 General acceptance of hospital, llomebound, and institu-
tional recreation services, with more attention given to
programs for the handicapped. There will be more instruc-
tion in recreation activities via TV and picture telephones.
0 Travel programs, such as planned bus trips, plane ridcs,
hostcling, and horseback trips, will be requested and used.

JAKUARY 1959

o The need for teaching skills in sports, such as sailing,
skiing, howling, tennis, golf, fishing, water skiing, skin
diving, ice skating, and figure skating will greatly increase.
0 Today's do-it-yoursclf phase may become permanent and
spread into all areas of recreation. Should this dechOp
rapidly, it will change the emphasis of present-day depart-
ment services.

0 Some form of federal recreation service will become a
reality and there will be an increased number of state
recreation services.

0 lnternational recreation will develop if international
relationships improve.

0 New games and better designed recreation equipment and
apparatus will replace much of the present.

0 Demand _for services will exceed the normal increase in
budget appropriations; thus, an increase in charges and fees
will be necessary and accepted, if not initiated too rapidly.

Many schools throughout the nation are providing excel-
lent public recreation areas and facilities. The community
school—the school designed and built for community use——
is here to stay. The next ten years will see even greater
recreation programs in the community school idca. Schools
are in close contact with young people and their parents in
all neighborhoods of our cities and villages. With such a
wealth of assets and a better informed citizenry, schools are
bound to he recognized and eXploitcd for community rm-
reation.

Let us pause, now, to consider the future carefully. If
we prepare now for the leisure to come, our cities ten years
from now will have the most modern parks and recreation
program services ever conceived. We will also have the
healthiest and happiest citizenry!

want to use them for recreation pur-

If people enjoy thc outdoors and insist
upon outdoor recreation, they will use
some physical resources that might
otherwise be of very low recreation
value. If we are to estimate the future
need for and use of such land, then,
we must start with the people, the econ-
omy, and the culture of the future.

States is our general confidence in the
future and the general consensus as to
its approximate dimensions. We con—
fidently expect more people, an expand—
ing total economy, and generally higher
living standards for all. This confidence
is in sharp contrast to the doubt and un—
certainty that dominated our thinking
as a nation roughly twenty-five years

 ago.

Today, in contrast, we seem confi-
dent, optimistic. in spite of technologi-
cal changes and international tensions,
which could conceivably knock all our
material and intellectual achievements
and aspirations into a cocked hat. Per-
haps the thought of holocaust is simply
too awful to be acceptable and hence is
instinctively rejected as a basis for
planning. However, accepting the gen-
eral mood of the nation, including its
scholars and social scientists, let us look
a little more specifically at our project-
ed economy and society.

The discussions among demograph-
ers, and others concerned with popula-

'1, 

  

tion, relate to the dimensions of futurc
population increases, not their exis-
tence. Nearly all population forecasts
during the past twenty years have been
woefully in error—much more so than
population forecasts of carlier periods
-—and hence many students shy from
making new ones. My own guess is that

we shall have ahout 240,000,000 people
in 1980 and about 310,000,000 in 2000;

many cstimatcs are lower and some
higher. Whatevcr the exact figure, we
can be sure that, unless present demo-
graphic trends change suddenly and
drastically, the population of these
future dccades will be much higher than
now.

This larger population will surely
have many more older people—those of
sixty-five years and over. Their num-
ber can be forecast for several decades
ahead with high accuracy, if one as-
sumes no major disaster, since all these
people are now alive.

There is also a general consensus that
per capita real income will be higher

upon the total amount of recreation

accurate data has existed in this coun-
try, real income per capita has trendcd

nually. If it continues, per capita real

tween these types of areas. There is
some overlap of types of use—conceiv-
ably some family might spend its vaca-
tion in a city park, and a few people
live close enough to national parks or
forests for an after-work picnic. How-
ever, I find this classification useful.

l have estimated that in 2000 the
potential demand for recreation, com-
pared with actual use in 1956, will be as
follows: for user-oriented areas, four

demanded, with even greater demands
placed upon a particular area. If one
area has unusually good facilities. it
may well have people flocking to it from
long distances.

, , Mnlti IIicntive Demand
It Is lnghly probable that the average }

citizen will enjoy more leisure in the
f uturc than the past. The average work-
week for all workers has declined from
seventy hours in 1850 to the present
forty. l estimate that the national aver-
age workweek in 1980 will be thirty-
No hours and, in 2000, twenty-eight

will be lost by the extra time required
traveling from home to office and back,
but much will he a genuine increase in

To the best of our knowledge, the
effects of population, per capita income,
leisure, and mobility are multiplicative.
That is, twice as many pe0ple, twice as
high per capita income, fifty per cent
more travel per capita, and perhaps fifty
per cent more real leisure in 2000, as

 

times greater; for intermediate areas,
sixteen times greater; for resource-
based areas, forty times greater. Obvi-
ously, no one can have great confidence
in these exact magnitudes. We know
too little about present, past, and future

workers had any paid vacation; now,
most have one, two, or three weeks;
in another generation, the four- and six-
week paid vacations will be common.

People in the United States are almost
certainly going to be more mobile in the
future than now. In 1900, the average
person traveled about five hundred
miles a year by mechanical transporta-
tion; today, the average person travels
over five thousand; in 2000, the aver-
age person probably will travel seventy-

five hundred miles or more annually.

married. and had children in the same
house; and one generation ago, in the
same town. Today, it is usual for
young men and women to go to college
in a different city than the one in which
their parents live; travel about the coun-
try or the world while in military serv-
ice; take jobs in cities other than the
one in which they were born; and move
from city to city as economic oppor-
tunity beckons. Moreover, even those
families staying within the same city
often move from suhurb to suburb as
their family grows and ages. We, in
this country, are definitely not tied to
one locality by custom, family, and job
as in the past, or in the way much of the
rest of the world still is today.

The increase in physical mobility is, for .

perhaps more. \Ve simply do not know
precisely; we know only very imperfect-
ly the effect of these factors today and
in the recent past. Sound park and rec-
reation planning must project several
decades ahead; yet this means extra-
polation far into the future of a some-
what uncertain past relationship.

The general future demand for out-
door rccreation will. fall differently
upon different types of areas in differ-
ent locations. We have developed and
find useful the following general classi-
fication of outdoor recreation areas:

0 User-oriented areas, which must be
so closely located with respect to users
that they are readily availahle after
school and after work. City parks are
typical examples. Such areas are often
small; location is much more impor-
tant than physical characteristics.

0 Resource-based areas, the dominant
characteristic of which is their unusual
scenic and other characteristics. Pco'
plc must travel to wherever such areas
are to be found; hence, they are used
National
parks are a good example. Mountains,
seashores, and lake country fall in this

mostly during vacations.

category.
0 lntermediate areas, located within
perhaps one to two hours travel time
from most users, on the best sites avail-
able within such radius, and used
chiefly for all-day outings. Many state
parks fall in this category.

Each of these areas has its character-
istic activities and use patterns. More-

my earlier comn1cnts———tl1at a very large
increase in demand for outdoor recre-
ation is in the making. Moreover, they
give a reasonably accurate idea of
where the magnitude of the future hur-
den will fall. The more distant and rela-
tively more desirable areas will face the
greatest increase in demand.

"that?

Futnre Areas of Recreation Land

If something of the rough magnitude
of the foregoing estimates of recreation
demand are to he met, how much land
will this mean for 2000? As to the user-
oricnted areas, their present acreage is
about half, or somewhat less, than the
usually accepted standards of municipal
park adequacy would suggest. More-
over, some of the existing acreage is
poorly located or not soundly planned
and used. Instead of the roughly 750,-
000 acres in municipal parks, there
should be roughly 2,000,000 more. In
2000, if p0pulation grows as l have sug-
gested, and if most of the increase is in
cities, and if park standards were to be
met, this would require about 6.000,-
000 acres. It seems most unlikely that
any such areas will be made availahle.
For one thing, in the older cities, where
areas are now deficient, it would be very
costly and difficult to provide enough
park acreage. Even more serious, the
typical suburb is making wholly inade-
quatc provision of park acreage. Some

13

«Iv-u“.

regions, notably the South, have been
and are very deficient in city park area,
and this seems likely'to continue.

If acreage of user-oriented rccrea-
tion areas does not eXpand as rapidly as
urban p0pulation grows, then the avail-
able acreage will have to be used at even
higher intensity of use than at present,
or many people will be without ade-
quate park services, or some of both.

The greatest Opportunity for expan-
sion exists for the intermediate type of
recrcation areas. While these should be
on the best sites available within the
distance limitations suggested, there is
often great choice of site possible. To
a very large extent, recreation areas of
the intermediate type can be made——
they need not be found; that is, tracts
of forest or farm land can be made into
quite adequate parks. Small dams can
make small lakes along relatively small
stream channels, in rolling country. I
have seen several such through the Mid-
west, but I have also seen hundreds, if
not thousands, of such sites unused for
this purpose, and indeed not heavily
used for anything.

Since the intermediate recreation
areas are also deficient in meeting pres-
ent needs I would suggest something
like a doubling of the present area, but
in comparatively small parks rather
than in some of the present large ones.
If the future demands sketched are to
be met, then the area in 2000 will have
to be roughly ten times or more what it
is today. This assumes major increases
in reservoir and other water areas as
well as in land areas.

Although the resource-based recrea-
tion areas will bear the brunt of the
greatest relative increase in use, pros-
pects for increasing acreage of this
type of area are poor. Most areas of
quality high enough to ustify inclusion
in this category are already in public
ownership and are used or usable for
recreation or are in private ownership
and used for this purpose. We may add
a few more national parks and other
kinds of units to the national park sys-
tem; but, as far as I know, the greatest
area of land suitable for this purpose is
already within this system or is else-
where in federal ownership. The net
acreage of national forests is likely to
increase but little; while federal wild-

14

life areas might have fifty per cent
added to them, yet this is still relatively
small. Seashore and Iake frontage is
largely privately owned and used for
recreation today. There are great tracts
within many of these public holdings
having relatively little recreation use,
because they were not developed for

The major impact upon resource-
based recreation areas will be in terms
of more intensive use. This will be both
greater use of currently heavily used
areas, and greater spreading of use into
areas now relatively lightly used. Hun-
dreds, if not thousands, more camp-
grounds could be developed in the na-
tional forests, for instance. In many of
the privately owned lake frontages, use
is becoming much more intensiVe; and
it is being pushed to less attractive
spots. If we are i‘eally going to have
forty timcs as much use of this type of
area in forty years, then obviously some
truly major adjustments in use patterns
are inevitable.

Recreation Personnel

It will do little good to provide ad-
ditional recrcation areas if we do not
also provide additional recreation per-
sonnel, for natural resources and recre-
ation leadership are inseparable part-
ners in any good program. We will
obviously need far more men and
women in this field; I would also argue
that we need better trained ones—better
trained in the social sciences, particu-
larly. The rccreation executive of the
future will be increasingly concerned
with the handling of peOple, although
care and management of resources will
continue in importance.

Some Problems and Policy Issues

The following is a mere listing of
some of the most important problems
and policy issues looming ahead:

0 How can we get the necessary recrea-
tion areas set aside soon enough? In
many instances, it could be shown that
early reservation of recreation areas
would be sound economics—that pres-
ent costs, plus interest on such costs,
would account to far less than future
costs. This is not primarily an eco-

nomic problem, rather mostly a political
one—how to get cities, counties and
states to incur expenditures for land ac-
quisition well in advance of pressing
need.

0 How much of the needed recreation
opportunity must be publicly provided,
and how much can be and should be
privately provided? There have been
powerful arguments for public provi-
sion of recreation in the past; the fact
that privately owned areas were usu-
ally closed except to their owners has
been one argument against private pro-
vision of recreation areas. Possibly we
could devise new arrangements between
landowners and recreationists, so that
land could be privately owned for some
purposes and yet publicly used by
others for recreation.

0 Who should pay for the provision of
public recreation, and how? Specifi-
cally, how much of the total cost should
be raised by entrance fees and other use
charges, how much by general taxes?

0 What should be the relationship be-

tween federal, state, and local govern-
nlents in this matter of recreation?
With the greater p0pulation mobility,
it will be increasingly difficult to make
the service area of a rccreation tract
conform to the legal boundaries of the
government unit that provided it. How
far should we be thinking of grants-in-

- aid or other financial aid from the fed-

eral government to the states, and from
the states to local units of government?
0 How are we going to preserve the
character of our best resource-based
recreation areas, in the face of the vast
increases in their use, which seem pos-
sible if not probable? I mean not only
the physical preservation of the area,
but also the preservation of the qual-
ity of the emotional and spiritual exper-
iencc of enjoying it. I fear some of our
national parks and forests are becoming
glorified parkways, and I do not think
this is what they were created for. Is
this the best way to prevent their de-
gradation, the provision of ample lower
grade recreation areas for those who
are perfectly satisfied with just the out-
doors? Can we any longer plan for the
future use of one kind of outdoor recre-
ation area or must we include the total-
ity of resources and of use over very
wide areas? #

Do school-learned activities
and skills carry over to
after-school recreation?

Elizabeth A. Ludwig

lf play skills taught in elementary schools are not being profitably used during leisure time, why not?

Bridging the Gap . . .
Between School St Community

[THIN RECENT years there has
been an evident awakening on
the part of educators, recreation per-
sonnel, and many agencies concerned
with human welfare to the need for ade-

quate education for leisure. Accord-
ing to August Heckscher, director of

the Twentieth Century Fund, it has been
estimated that the four-day week will
be established by 1975 (RECREATION,
December, 1958, page 340) . This state-
ment is made “on the basis of increased
productivity plus the proportion of
gains wliich the American people have
in the past given to time off as opposcd
to more goods.”

Simply ofiering the individual oppor-
tunities to participate in leisure-time
activities will not necessarily draw him
into participation, however. If he does
not have the skills to play, he will con-

0n the
other hand, he may be taught many lei-

tinue to sit on the sidelines.

cause he is unaware of such opportuni-
ties in his community.

As a teacher of girls in high-school
physical education, I have been, for
many years, concerned with the carry-
over value of class skills and activities
to the recreation life of the student dur-
ing out-of-school time. Such carry-
over is clearly an objective of a good
physical education program, yet
whether the objective is ever reached is
the question. liecent studies seem to in-
dicate that, although there is some
carry-over, the relationship is not high.
There is a highcr rclationship between
the activities in the extracurricular and
out-of-class program conducted in
school and the leisure-time activities
out of school; and it has been shown
that, in the leisurestime activities, non-
creative, sedentary predominates.

The question is: where does the prob-
lem of carry-over lie? If students in
secondary schools are being taught
skills and knowledge that can be profit-
ably used during leisure time, why are
they not using them? There are un-
doubtedly many answers that would, in
part, explain this failure.

One: of them is the “ell-known psy-

chological axiom that there is a transfer

or carry-over in learning when there
arc identical elemcnts present, when the
learner recognizes and sees the rclation-
ships betwcen the skill he has learned
and the one he is trying to learn. There
are some implications here for both the
teacher and the rccreation leader. Tak-
ing physical education as a convenient
example, although this would apply to
othcr fields as well, it is probahle that
many activities taught during classtinle
arc also oileer by recreation groups in
the community sometime within the
scope of their year’s program. Too often
these groups and thc school are only
vaguely familiar with what the other is
oflering.

In order to assist students in under-
standing their leisure-time needs and
how thcse may be met in a particular
community, cooperation between teach-

er and recreation leader seems impera-
tive. Again taking the physical activity
program as an example, there are a
number of excellent opportunities for
both groups to get together in a cooper-
ative program. Physical education
teaches many activities usually carried
on in evening recreation programs.

Philany benefits may accrue when effort

orking in the areas of recreation and
ducation for leisure in a particular

standing, not on the administrative
level, but rather among those who work
directly with the participants; rcSpect
for one another’s efforts; understand-
ing of problems; deeper interest in the
needs of the boys and girls concerned;
agreement on the handling of mutual
problems; and the sharing of successes
and failures are all within the realm of
possibility.

How, then, can this cooperation be
achieved? What are some of the spe-
cific approaches to developing better co-
operation on the teacher-leader level?

The Recreation Leader

The recreation leader should try to:
0 Make a personal effort to visit the
neighborhood schools from which par-
tici pants comc. Good salesmen know the
importance of such contacts. Teachers
re flattered by this attention. The busi-
ness transacted at such a meeting will
depend upon the particular situation,
but it might include discussions of pro-
gram objectives, possibility of a cooper-
alive prOgram, problems of scheduling
activities, and so on.
0 Attempt to coordinate the program
of activities where feasible. This may,
in part, he determined by a community-
wide schedule that cannot be changed,

t3

  

but a discussion of the possibilities of
coordinated efforts might eventually
lead to some mutually agreeable efforts
in some activities, at least. The boy or
girl, learning some basic leisure-time
skills in school, may be helped to see the
relationship between them and his own

out-of-school activities and opportuni-
ties.

£12

0 Give the loeal school activities public-
ity and support. Most youngsters like
to see their names and that of their
school in print or posted on a bulletin
board. The association between the
school and the recreation agency is then
more clear in the eyes of the child, and
there are benefits to hoth the child and
the agencies involved.

0 Work with a neighborhood council
composed of representative students
from the local schools. Dependent on
its functions, this council also might
well include neighborhood parents and
teacher representatives. In either case,
such a council not only encourages par-
ticipation at the recreation center but
assists the leader in keeping a finger on
the community’s pulse. Active partici-
pation in this type of advisory group
tends to develop a feeling of rcSponsi-
bility toward those sharing in it. From
this council might well grow an activity
group of young voluntccr leaders.

0 Plan special events around individual
schools, such as “Central High Night.”
Having the school stand out develops a
feeling of importance among the par-
tieipants. It fosters a sense of “belong-
i ng” to two groups, both made more im-
portant because of the desirable public-
ity involved.

The Teacher

The teacher should try to:
o Publicize the prOgram of the recrea-
tion center by posting the opportunities
available for all types of activity at all

age levels. Post tournament results

when students are involved, mention-
ing names of participants. The same
technique may be used to indicate per-
formers in dramatic events, music, art

exhibits, and the like. Where similar or
related activities are being offered in
the school program, point up the rela-
tionship. Brief class announcements
may assist in generating interest.

0 Watch for “tcaehable moments" in
which to discuss the importance of de-
vel0ping recreation skills for leisure-
time use and opportunities for recrea-
tion in the community. In some classes,
whole units might well be devoted to
the study of the importance of recrea-
tion to the individual and society, and
emphasis placed on the learning of
some new skills. Such units are logical

.in social studies, health education,

home economics, and physical educa-
tion.

0 Invite a recreation leader from the
neighborhood center to speak and hold
conferences with students. Many sub-
jects of interest might be discussed,
ranging from the center’s program to
vocations in recreation.

0 As part of a unit in recreation, or as
a special project, have classes visit a
community recreation center or other
recreation agency, such as the Y’s in
the neighborhood. These field trips are
most meaningful when they are related
to classroom activities, but must be well
planned to be of maximum value. Con-
tacts with these recreation groups may
be continued throughout the school
year as some desirable recreation prac-
tices are deveIOped.

o A school recreation council might
well be organized to plan the total rec-
reation' program within the school and
to work with community agencies in co-
ordinating offerings. Occasionally the
community recreation leader might be
invited to these meetings to discuss
mutual problems.

Undoubtedly there are many other
ways in which teacher-leader e00pera-
tion might be developed, depending on
the local situation and the enthusiasm
and farsightedness of the personnel in-
volved. The need for helping students
bridge the gap between the leisure-time
skills learned in school and the oppor-
tunities for practicing and developing
these skills after school hours is urgent
and important. #5

Horsepower adds zest to skiing in this world of

down Olympus. I was king of the universe; 1 had mastered
gravity and centrifugal force.

1 skidded to a stop at the end of the waiting line, glow-
ing and exhilarated. ln front of me was small boy, perhaps
ten years old. In front of him was a man in his sixties.
The older man was looking toward the top of the mountain
with an eager light in his eyes. The youngster was looking
up at me with the light of pure wonderment.

“Gee, mister,” the boy said, “you old guys sure come
down slow and cautious, don’t you?"

 

The marvelous thing about skiing is that speed is purely
relative, and you feel it in relation to your ahility to handle
it. 1 was completely honest in describing iny sensations
during that descent. l really felt as though I were llying.
The boy was completely honest, too——and disconcertingly
direct—but he got the same thrill of speed when he came
down later, at a speed he could handle. And the old man
probably got the biggest thrill of any of us, although his
rate of speed on the trip down was considerably slower
than mine.

The same prineiple holds for.iee skating. You put on a
burst of sheer speed. or you charge into a game of hockey,
or gracefully glide into a figure eight, and you feel you
have conquered all the worlds there are. That your aeeom-

plishntent may be mediocre compared to that of experts
lessens the thrill not one bit.

Millions _of Amerieans have found this out and are get-
ting healthful ycar-round outdoor activity. But it has not
always been so. Not so many years ago the accepted sym-
bol of winter-time enjoyment was a roaring open fire, a
steaming mug of something hot to drink, and a storm door
battened down securely against the icy blasts. The real en-
joyment of winter, we felt then, came in getting comfort-
ably away from it.

I t was different with children, of eourse. Children loved
the winter for its own sake and looked forward eagerly to
the arrival of the snow to go coasting with their new Christ-
mas sleds. Many of us will never forget that childhood
thrill of the first freeze-up, when we awoke to 5nd ponds

and creeks solid and shining and went trudging off with
skates over our shoulders to find the nearest sheet of ice
and a day of incomparable sport. We returned in the eve-
ning, with shivering limbs and chattering teeth, happy
clear through. That was when the roaring hearth fire and
the cup of hot chocolate were really appreeiated.

A few adults joined the fun on the sleds and the skates,
but they were few indeed. Fewer still were those strange
fanatics who strapped on skis and went yodeling off through
the darndest blizzards or sailing off those incredible ski
jumps in an open invitation to sudden death. They were
the nonconformists. It was suspected that they were more
than a little touched in the head.

Nowadays, things are different. Every fall, millions of
anxious-eyed enthusiasts begin scanning the skies for indi-
cations of a sharp ehange in the weather; not in the fear
that a severe storm may be coming up, hut in the fear that
one isn’t. Inoffensive weather forecasters get midnight
telephone calls from eomplete strangers wanting to know
if there isn’t some way a snowstorm can be induced to drop
its payload over the nearest mountains—which may be a
few hundred miles away. Every weekend, metropolitan
railway stations are thronged with people carrying scven-
foot lengths of hickory or twelve-inch blades of steel, board-

ing the snow trains that will carry them to the nearest
winter resorts.

Monday morning those same peOple are haek at the office,
clear-eyed, bronzed, and smiling. Not one in a thousand
returns to the hot footbath and mustard-plaster treatment
once the accepted penalty of “winter exposure.”

Winter sports did not spring full-bloom into existence in
the early 1930’s. Records of the ski and the skate go far
back into history; in fact, there is conclusive evidence that
the ski far antedates written history and that man had
learned to carve a wooden slat to hold his weight above the
snow some sixty centuries ago. The ice skate is a much more
recent development, but still no Johnny-eome-lately on the
winter scene. Written discussions of ice skating are found
as far back as the twelfth century, and, by the mid-1500’s,
the frozen canals of Holland were carrying a fairly steady
stream of skate-shod traffic every winter.

Every form of winter transportation—skis, skates, snow-
shoes, toboggans, and sleds—was developed under the spur
of serious necessity, to carry on the business of survival.
Competitive instinct being what it is, it was inevitable that
thc men who were traveling through the Scandinavian for-
ests on skis or over the Dutch canals on skates should deeide
to get together for tests of speed, skill, and stamina. In
Norway, ski jumping was developed as the first purely ree-
reational form of skiing.

It was the deveIOpment of downhill skiing that gave the
sport universal appeal. Ski jumping was, and is, near tops
in spectator thrill; but the average watcher, though im-
pressed, is rarely impelled to “go and do likewise.”

20

Langlauf, the cross-country racing that is one branch of
Scandinavian skiing (the other being the Arlberg System,
for steep mountains), is even less likely to become widely
popular. It is too much like ivork for anyone but the Scan-
dinavians and, more recently, the Russians.

Downhill skiing is something else again. When you see
Stein Erickson speeding down a slalom course, you may
not be able to approaeh his speed or teehnique, but in a
short time you can learn enough skiing so you can try.
More important, you will feel like you are going just as
fast as the experts you watched. It is that relative thrill
of speed, previously mentioned. It’s wonderful!

Over here in America, there was some early winter sport
activity, but on a very smallws'éhle.‘ The‘ early Dutch-set-
tlers had brought their skates with them and were skim-
ming over the ice around New York in Colonial times. The

Dartmouth Outing Club was founded in 1910 and has be-
come entrenched in the folklore of winter America.

Still and all, American winter sports partieipants were
so few they could almost he counted—up to 1932. That
was the year the Winter Olympics came to Lake Placid in
New York State and Americans had their first closeup look
at how the exPerts did it. They saw the world’s best ski
jumpers soaring gracefully into space and they felt stirrings
in their breasts they had never felt before. They saw a little
Norwegian miss named Sonja Henie perform on skates and
found they had never imagined the possibilities of the sport.
Almost overnight, they changed from a nation of winter
stay-at-homes to confirmed winter sports enthusiasts.

The first ycars of the changc were fabulous. More and
more people were getting in on the winter sports act and
few of them had' the slightest idea how to dress. They wore
their old hiking clothes, with high leather boots that bound
the leg muscles and soakcd up water. They were heavy
leather jackets that soon had them sweating. They wore
ordinary gloves and spent half their time swinging their
arms wildly and blowing frantically on blue hands. And
they still had fun!

A few ski instructors were eoniing over from Europe, but
few indeed were the hopefuls fortunate enough to eome in
contact with the experts. There was a peculiar destiny watch-
ing over and protecting those early winter sports devotees!

Bcfore long, the new army of winter sportsmen began to
learn. And they learned fast. Now the winter months,
which used to seem interminable, are far too short for the
growing army of winter sports lovers. It is estimated that
during January, February, and March fifteen thousand
Americans will take off for Europe, for serious skiing, and
another hundrcd thousand will— spend at least a few days at
an Alpine resort. Airlines offer all-exPense package ski
jaunts.

If you have not yet joined the winter sports army, it is
not too late to start. Whether you join your boy on his
Flexible Flyer, make like Dick Button on the nearest sheet
of ice, or hie yourself to the mountains with a pair of skis,
you’ll find things about winter air and sunshine that you
never imagined—and will never forget! #

How to Make
Bongo Drums

Methods used successfuiiy in a tummy

RUMMING is a fascinating form of
D music, and bongo drums are pop-
ular. The making of them leads natu-
rally to the playing of them; and so a
new music experience is added to the
program—one not only with an indi-
vidual appeal, but with audience value
as well, once the technique is mastered
(RECREATION, May, 1956, page 238) .

The construction of bongo drums in-
cludes the use of oak kegs and clear raw-
hide leather, but oak kegs are some-
times hard to find. Meat kegs, small
vinegar kegs, kegs used for bulk lard,
and for shipment of herring in bulk are
ideal in size and wood. Clear rawhide
leather may also be difficult to find.
It is not generally stocked in supply
houses, and must be ordered well in
advance.

Because of these difficulties, you may
have to substitute smaller nail kegs and
use skiver leather. The latter is easily
obtained, but it tears easily, is very
porous and soft, and will stretch. Han-
dled with care, however, these substi-
tutes will be satisfactory.

For our service-club project at Fort

 

Lewis, \Vashington, under the direction
of recreation leader Margaret Jaberg
(now service club director at Presidio
of Monterey, California, we finally were
able to get four small nail kegs and one
small oak water keg. To turn these into
bongo drums we used the following
supplies: eight boxes of brass tacks, one
quart castor oil, one whole skin of
skiver leather, two used clear rawhide
leather drumhcads, sandpaper, paint
remover, wood glue, paint, paint-
brushes, paste wax, hammers, saw, one
large container to soak leather. Most
of these supplies are on hand in most
workshops, and cost is low.

We made the drums in a workshOp,

which lasted two weeks. We set up three
card tables in the lounge, with news-
papers protecting the tables and floor.
Everyone passing the tables was inter-
ested and enthusiastic.

The drmns were first used in a par-
ticipation show called “A Night in
Spain," developed as a direct result of
the workshop. This program featured
outdoor cafe entertaimnent, Spanish
songs and dancing, and, of course, the
hongos. Since then the drums have
been in great demand—GERALDYNER,

Other Drums

Off Drums. In the West lndies melodic
and haunting music is produced from
oil drums. Trimmed with a hacksaw,
tuned with a Sledgehammer. the oil bar-
rel has a fragile, muted, bell-like tone
that has created a new type of music,
as expressive a part of West Indian cul-
ture as the Calypso singers. Oil barrel
orchestras are called “steel percussion
bands,” and there are hundreds of them.

Some of the drums are shallow and
hang by straps from the musicians’
shoulders; others stand on the ground,
waist high. The players heat them in a
whirling oval motion, with rubber-tip-
ped sticks, and with the rhythm horn in
them.

The barrel sounded its first note of
harmony on the island of Trinidad,
scarcely ten years ago, when a water-
front genius discovered that by putting
different sized dents in the top of a fifty-
five-gallon drum he could get several
different notes. At that moment, the
steel hand was born.

Somebody discovered that if you cut
the skirt of the oil drum to different
lengths you could vary the quality and
tone of the note: now there are many
trade secrets in relation to their mak-
ing.

According to the Music Iournaf of
September, 1958, the United States
Navy now has a steel band of its own,
organized by liear Admiral Daniel V.
Gallery. commandant of the Tenth
Naval District, with headquarters at
San Juan. Puerto Rico. They call them-
selves “Admiral Dan's Caribbean Band,"
also known as “The Pandemoniacs.”

A Portrait

of Mr. Recreation

F or a long time, we have wanted to know Mr. Recreation
better; so recently (August, 1958) we sent him. a list of
questions, and he has been pleased to write us about him.-

self. Out of fourteen hundred recreation executives, 615
answered us.

-As a Person

THERE IS A MAN in your town, and in almost every town
in the United States—a cheerful, tireless fellow who
stands out in any group, who ranks as a local hero in the
eyes of the young. He is often named citizen-of-the-year,
because, in his capacity as dedicated public servant, he has
contributed time and leadership far beyond the call of duty.
Every day he is called upon to be practically all things to
all people, and play is his business—big business. This
is Mr. Recreation.

He is human, even as you and l—although this fact is
sometimes overlooked. Logically enough, you will find he
is also Mr. Average American. He is a family nlan—a
husband, father, and citizen in his own right—and many of
the things he does for the town are not really a part of his
job at all, but, rather, the contributions of a man who
acknowledges the responsibilities of citizenship.

His age is somewhere between thirty and forty, and he has
two or three children. He is a man who works hard, plays
hard, is young enough to enjoy his leisure, heartily, if any,
and inspire countless others to do the same. He has his
own tastes, hobbies, and favorite leisure-time pursuits. He
participates actively in sports and athletics. His personal
preferences in these fields are swimming, fishing, golf, base-
ball, boating, basketball, hunting, and tennis, in that order.
Among his other recreation interests, ballroom dancing is
high on the list, with square dancing a close second. Read-
ing is ahead of TV watching, and, surprisingly enough,
gardening takes precedence over card playing. Carpentry
heads his handcraft list, with painting next, and ceramics
third. In music, he prefers attending concerts, then listen-
ing to hi-fi, with choral groups third. He tries to enjoy his
choice of these at least once a week. He also fancies him-
self as something of an actor, is apt to join the local
amateur theater group.

When on vacation, he likes to travel, if possible; other-

22

 

wise, he enjoys just visiting with family and friends, or
relaxing at home. He enjoys camping, too, and the chance
to practice camping skills. However, he has been known to
forfeit his vacation (as well as many a free evening) under
press of duty, or to stay at home to do household chores
when needs be. Even as you and I, he can think of many
additional things he would like to do one day, more hobbies
to try, but claims there is never enough time in which to
enjoy them.

He is a busy man. In top administrative posts, he is most
often known as “superintendent of recreation”; although,
in many instances, his title embraces parks as well. Some-
times it is even associated with the board of education. At
other times he is recreation “director,” or just plain “lead-
er,” but it all means a man skilled in leadership and recre-
ation techniques.

In the summertime, he claims he needs “three heads,
nineteen arms, and the ability to be in four or five places at
one time.” It is then he concerns himslf with summer play-
grounds, swimming and water facilities and programs, sum-
mer theaters, band shells and concerts, day and overnight
camping, baseball, softball, tennis, Observances of National
Recreation Month, and so on. He therefore welcomes win-
ter’s relative quiet, when all he has to tbink of is commu-
nity center maintenance and programs, staff training and
personnel practices, public relations and interpretation, the
passing of bond issues, leagues at play, community theater,
maintenance of sports and athletic fields and equipment,
outdoor winter sports, swimming pools and gyms, commu-
nity-wide Observances of various kinds—Halloween, United
Nations Day, Brotherhood Week, Christmas, Easter, and
so on. When you inquire about the local barber-shop quar-
tet, senior citizens’ services to the hospital, swimming club
for the blind, arts and crafts program for the handicapped,
or a new volunteer training group, you find Mr. Recrea-
tion behind it.

His responsibilities and services cannot be conducted
from behind a desk nor timed by a clock. Night and day, he
is apt to be disturbed at odd hours with questions ranging
from the sensible to the whacky, or with calls for help—
sometimes completely unrelated to recreation. The latter,
of course, come because he is a “good Joe.” One executive

reports a midnight call from an irritated citizen to dis-
cuss softball league rules; another at six A..\l. from a little
girl who wanted to know if the swinnning pool wouhl be
open at noon, and an 505 on Sunday afternoon to help
catch a rattlesnake under somebodyls hcnhousc. But Mr.
liecreation's patience is unlimited; it has to bc—and it cer-
tainly helps if he has a sense of humor.

He gets along with people because he likes them. Children
ve him; adults respect him. lle is a man of many friends.
e is in a position to do more with restless tecn-agers than
nyone else in town. He turns young vandals into enthusi-
tic ballplayers, litterbugs into conscientious citizens, hot
odders into responsible drivers. He loves it. The joys and
rrows of tangling with parents and other taxpayers are
's, along with thc job of educating local folks to the need
r, and advantages of, a municipal recreation department.
Ile understands his community. He uses, fully and un-
fishly, any special talents he may have to increase his de-
artment's service to make the connnunity a better place in
'hich to live. He gives full time to his job, and then many
urs over; but he continues to have his own hopes and
reams, disappointments and satisfactions, even as you

ad I. I
His success is not marked by facts and figures, but by the
tangible influence which he has upon his community, the
ichness of living he has been able to bring its citizens
ough recreation.-——DOROTHY DONALDSON, Editor, REC-

QUESTION I dealt with the amount spent in 1957, by the
responding executives or their agencies, for various selected
types of equipment, and with the authority exercised by the
executives for these purchases. Table l summarizes the re-
plies of the 480 executives who answered this question. It
shows that, in addition to the eXpected amounts listed for
such items as playground equipment, recreation readers
or their agencies spent surprisingly large amounts in 1957,
for major construction and for purchase of heavy equip-
ment. Nearly two million dollars were spent for ground
maintcnance alone. The steadily increasing demand for
swimming facilities was reflected in the more than nine
million dollars spent for pools by this group last year.

QUESTION Il, in regard to future plans, received responses
from 479 readers. These are summarized in graph form, in
Table ll. The widespread growth of recreation facilities,
recorded since the end of World War l], is slated to con-
tinue through 1960, according to this graph. The fact that
more than half the replies to this question listed lighting
installations probably indicated increasing adult use of
public rccreation facilities.

QUESTION lll _requested a comparison between the current
operating budget for this year and that for 1957, not includ-
ing appropriations for major new construction. 0f the 476
“individuals furnishing this information, 310, or 55 per
cent, have a larger budget than last year, 25 or 5 per cent,
have a smaller budget; 140, or 29 per cent, reported no
significant change. Apparently the business recession of
1957-58 was not reflected in the majority of recreation
budgets.

ing services. Answers show those items most frequently
made available by the agencies of the 429 executives an-
swering this question. Other items mentioned too infre-
quently to record indicate that it is possible to borrow or
rent almost any type of equipment, from a jukebox or an
Aqua-lung to a house trailer, from recreation agencies.—

hantl service, will be in eflect at the Men’s Singles

National Paddle Tennis Championship Tournament

The game of paddle tennis was originated by Frank Peer

been adopted by recreation leaders throughout the world.
Small wonder. It is a “natural.” It can be played on any
flat surface; the required area is comparatively small; pad-
dles are inexpensive; old tennis balls are perfect—and
official. Any person can enjoy a rally the first time he steps
on a court. The forty-four-foot court permits hard driving
and artful lobhing. Although any beginner can enjoy pad-
dle tennis, it takes a real athlete to play in championship
company.

Veteran tennis players love the game, with its fast re-
turns, accent on net play, and lightning footwork. Paddle
tennis gives lawn-tennis players—usually not overly fond
of indoor tennis because of the habitually poor lighting,
zooming rebounds off a board floor, and other factors——
an outdoor game to play during winter months.

This fascinating game, like others, is most enjoyable
when correctly played. Unfortunately, there is a rather
common misconception of how to play the game. Certain
equipment manufacturers and game-book publishers have
carelessly given wide circulation to what purport to be “of-
ficial” paddle-tennis rules. Hundreds of paddle-tennis
courts have been constructed using the outmoded 39" by 18"

dimensions. A hard-hit overhand serve, by an adult player
with a lawn-tennis background, on one of these small eourts,

makes the game entirely too one-sided. There are hardly
any rallies.

The United States Paddle Tennis Association rules com-
mittee has come up with what it thinks is paddle tennis in
its most enjoyable form. Please try it! The association
invites recreation leaders and paddle-tennis players every-
where to write and let it know what you think of the under-
hand serve requirement for adults; the use of the “dead-
ened” tennis ball; the 2'7”-high net pulled taut; the 22"
by 10’ service court for underhand servers. Rules commit-
tee members are Frank Peer Beal, Sarah Palfrey Danzig,
Murray Geller (chairman), Harold Kempler, Carolyn
Liguori, Rubin Resnick, and Robert E. Riggs.

The questions and answers following the official rules
will, the committee hopcs, help dispel the confusion that
seems to exist among players, recreation leaders, and de-
signers of athletic facilities.

Height of net: 2’ 7” at sidelines; pull net taut, with no more
than one-inch tolerance at center; net posts shall be eight-
een inches from sidelines.

Backspace: There shall be space behind the baselines of not
less than fifteen feet, and at the sides of not less than eight
feet, wherever possible.

Ohicial ball: A deadened tennis ball, a new, “second,” or
used tennis hall approved by the United States Lawn Ten-
nis Association, which has become soft or has been pricked
with a pin. When drOpped on a cement base from a height
of six feet, the deadcned tennis ball shall rebound from six
to eight inches lower than a USLTA approved new tennis
ball.

Service: For children thirteen years of age and under, two
overhand serves permitted as in lawn tennis. The serve
must strike within the service box. For adults, one under-
hand serve. If service be a fault, the server loses point. The
server shall stand behind the baseline alternately behind the
right and left courts, beginning from the right. The foot-
fault rule, the same as in tennis, shall be rigidly observed.
The ball served shall pass over the net and hit the ground
within the 22' by 10" service eourt diagonally opposite,
or upon any line bounding sueh court. (The twelve-foot
children’s service lines are ignored by adults.) It is a fault
if the serve does not strike the proper court or if the service
is overhand. A service shall be deemed to be overhand if
the ball at the instant of being struck be higher than the
server’s waist. Players fourteen years and older are con-
sidered adults within the meaning of these rules.

With the aforementioned exceptions the USLTA scoring
and playing rules shall govern.

Questions and Answers

( Inquiries dealing with the interpretation of rules and
similar matters should be addressd to Murray Geller, 0f-
jicial Rules Interpreter, United States Paddle Tennis Asso-
ciation, 189 Seeley Street, Brooklyn 18, New York.)
Question: Why the underhand service for,adults?

Answer: To prevent domination of the game by the server.

RECREATION 3

.‘Thc size of the paddle-tennis court makes it especially neces-
.ary to curtail the tremendous advantage the overhand
herver had, even when limited to only one serve. However,
children thirteen years old and under are permitted two
overhand serves as in lawn tennis. The rules committee was
guided in this mainly by the fact that paddle tennis is em-
ployed by many playgrotmd leaders in teaching children
rudiments of lawn tennis. .4

uestion: Are paddle-tennis court dimensions and rules
changed every year?
Answer: The 44' by 20' court has been standard for more
than twenty years. The underhand serve for adults was
finally officially adopted after years of public cxperimcnta-
tion.
Question: What is platform paddle tennis and how does it
differ from paddle tennis?
Answer: Platform paddle tennis was developed by chscn-
den S. Blanchard and his Scarsdale, New York, neighbor
James K. Cogswell. The game requires a wooden platform
60' by 30' surrounded by a twelve-foot mesh wire fence.
The platform and fence cost approximately three thousand
dollars to construct. The sponge rubber ball may be taken
off the hack and side wiring as in squash, provided it has
first struck inside the proper court. The court is 44' by 20',
with a service court twelve feet from net to service line.
The net is 3' 1” high at posts and 2'10" at center. One
:- vcrhand serve is permitted. If a hard smash bounds over
the twelve-foot fcncc a let is called. Since both platform
and our paddle tcnnis use the 44' by 20' dimensions, much
confusion has resulted on the part of architects and design-
crs of playground facilities. The platform game requires
backspace behind the baselines of only eight feet as the ball
can be played off the back wiring. In our game, which is
)Iaycd like lawn tennis, at least a fifteen-foot backspace is
equired. Insufficient backspace Spoils the game.

ANUARY 1959

 

Platform players have their own governing body, the
American Platform Tennis Association. Both games play
an increasingly important part in the Sporting activities of
our country. While platform tennis will continue to grow
in popularity, it is essentially better suited to private and
country-club than playground use.

Question: Does the United States Paddle Tennis Associa-
tion sell or manufacture paddle-tennis cquipment?
Answer: USPTA membership is made up of recreation
leaders and paddlc-tcnnis enthusiasts from all parts of the
United States and is not connected with any commercial
enterprise. The association is solely concerned with ex-
tending the popularity of paddlc tennis, standardizing di-
mensions and rules of play, organizing and conducting local
and national tournaments, and doing all it can to develop
the recreation features of the game.

Question: Why the dcadencd tennis ball?

Answer: The sponge rubber ball was unsatisfactory. It was
too lively when new, was difficult to control, and quickly
lost its shape and bounce. The dcadcned tennis ball has
been tried out for many years and is ideal. Most lawn-tennis
players accumulate enough used tennis balls after a few
weeks of play to provide themselves and their non-lawn-
tennis playing friends with sufficient .paddlc-tcnnis balls.
Question: Can paddle tennis be played on any flat surface?
Answer: Paddle tcnnis can be played indoors or outdoors,
on ccment, asphalt, composition, clay, wood, or grass.
Question: Why the “pulled taut” nct?

Answer: To minimize the great advantage held by the
player at the net. Even with the undcrhand-service rule,
there is no valid reason why the net should  lower at the
center (at which point the service passes over the net), and
higher at the sides. By pulling the net taut and 2' 7" (the
former height at posts was 2' 9”) the player at the baseline

has a chance to pass the net attacker down the sides. 3%

For June Graduates

June graduates were futiler looking
for work they were willing and able to
do or interested in learning to do.
Something had to be done. In the York
[Pennsylvania] Recreation Depart-
ment something was done—and suc-
cessfully.

Last summer twenty-three boys and
girls, most of them graduates, a few
seniors, registered with the Youth
Leader Corps set up and directed by
the department. Of these, nine were
placed in city playgrounds as assistant
Others were
available for cutting grass, gardening
help, baby sitting, help with planning
and directing picnic programs. There
was even a five-piece dance band re-
hearsing regularly, hoping for summer
work.

Every Monday afternoon, the youth
leaders were required to attend a de-
partment meeting. There they were

playground directors.

Six Hours of Training

Cameras and film are replacingizip
guns and switch-blade knives in the bor-
ough of Queens [New York], where
teen-agers from sixteen high schools re-
cently joined the Junior Inlluentials—
as distinguished from the junior delin-
quents. It all began when the Child

Service League, an organization, which

taught pl a y g r o u n d administration,
games, leadership, and crafts.

Cards were kept on each so that when
a call came in, thc director of the youth
leader program, Mrs. Elizabeth Frigm.
could see at a glance who was avail-
able and qualified for the job required.

Nine who showed leadership ability
were placcd on the city playgrounds
where they helped directors with games,
crafts, story reading, storing and check-
ing equipment and supplies, and giving
general hclp where needed.

At the rcquest of the many who want-
ed work but were without regular obs,
an employment bureau was set up in
the rccreation ollice.

Pay was moderate, ranging from
seventy-five cents to a dollar an hour,
and the young people did their chores
with thoroughness and enthusiasm.

Many of them began with the recrea-
tion department as junior leaders and
advanced with age and training to be-

Its budget couldn’t provide profes-

anyone in the organization who could
qualify as a photojournalist (RECREA-

TION, November, 1958, page 314). So

 

come youth leaders. This group formed
thc nucleus of the corps.

They were required to attend the
playground directors’ institute held in
May, in order to qualify for their spe-
cialized jobs. In addition to the play-
ground work, they were quite capable
of planning and carrying out picnic
programs. They were able to direct
games for adults and children, select
the prizes to bc awarded, call square
dances, conduct
dances.

The youngsters, blissfully unaware
of the intricacies of f stops and de-
rcloper formulas, adopted a plan con-
isting of four sessions each lasting only
an hour and a half for each of the three
roups.

This called for a radical departure
from customary teaching programs fol-
lowed by most photographic courses.
So the group was indoctrinated with a
series of thirty-nlinutc segments, each
aimed at highlights in the world of
photography.

Within the first hour of instruction,
this group was given a shooting assign-
mcnt. Using a
camera, which pcrnlittcd immedate re-
view of successes or failures, the teen-
agers were taught how not to place a
person against a distracting back-
ground, how not to use the harsh flash-
in-the-face technique, and how not to

permit the subject to look straight into
the lens.

Clubs

Monroe, Wisconsin, has two unusual
program features. The first is an auto
mechanics club for teen-agers, with no
hot-rodding or drag strips, and the sec-
ond is a teen-age disk-jockey club with
weekly radio programs.

At present we have eleven auto me-
chanie clubs with ninety members. Our
annual youth activity survey shows 132
youngsters interested in auto mechan-
ics. This information and suggestions
for a possible program were presented
to the garage owners, who reacted very
favorably to the idea. Each of those in-
tcrcsted presented the type of auto me-
chanic program he wanted to offer in
his shop, and provided at least one
lcader from within his shop stall. The
various programs were announced to
the students at a meeting, and they each
selected the programs they wanted, ex-
cept in two instances where straws were
drawn by two groups wanling the same
garage. Clubs range in size from six to
nineteen members, each club having its
own student leader, who handles any
formal meetings and acts as the club
represcntativc between weekly mectings.

Programs presented by the garages
ranged from technical training to fix-
ing up an old car and selling it. In six
months of operation some of the pro-
grams wcre found to be lacking in cer-
tain features, but in only one did at-

lendanee drop. Members in all groups
were told that poor attendance would
necessitate their expulsion from the
gronp, thus making room for a replace-
ment. (See September, 1958, RECREA-
TION Magazine, page 250.)

This program has been very success-

ful;

bers and schedules four persons a week

administrative work is done by club
mcmbers and the recreation depart-
ment, with the radio station providing

Dances

of Coed Teen Activities,“ edited by
Edythe and David DeMarehe, contains
the following suggestions for a dance.
This is only one of the many excellent
activities included.
Ha” Dance. Classes at school often find
it fun—and much more economical—
to have a Hall Dance, and it is an idcal
way to raise money. . . . it's done simply
by roping oil one of the school corri-
dors after classes arc over for the day,
and providing a several-piece orchestra
or good record player with a large
choice of records. The guests wear
their school clothes.

One way of controlling admittance is
through use of one of the classrooms
that has two doors, entering by one,
paying admission. and going out on the
“dance floor” through the other door.

No decorations are necessary, since
this is a money raiser. Refreshmcnts
can be bypassed. too. unless some of the

ICE RINKS

Make an Ice Applicator

n

ASMALL VERMONT community made a device to apply
a thin film of hot water to the surface of their ice skat-
ing rink in order to secure “perfect ice.” Another Vermont
community used the idea to construct a machine of its own
for the same purpose. The device is a barrel on a trailer,
with a length of pipe attached to the rear of the barrel. Holes
in this pipe let hot water drip onto a burlap sheet, which is
attached to the pipe and drags along the surface of the ice.
The principle behind all this is that, when hot water is
used in small amounts, it freezes faster than cold water.
Hot water also melts down the high bumps and obstructions
on the ice and fills in the small pit holes and cuts made by
flashing blades. This is the same principle as that of larger
ice machines. This type of equipment is used with high
success in hockey rinks and for ice-skating shows all over
the country. (It may also be used to apply liquid fertilizer
to large areas of lawn.) '

This simple piece of equipment may be made in a num-
ber of ways. The basic design and construction are given

so anyone can build it. Its construction need not be ex-
pensive or elaborate; in fact, the more simple, the less
trouble there will be with maintenance and repairs.

One community used a boat trailer as the vehicle for its
drum of hot water and plans next year to add a second drum
in tandem to cut the number of trips in half. The other
town made its trailer out of old automobile parts and elec-
trical wiring pipe. The machine should be made as light as

28

possible and yet cover the largest area for its weight. The
trailer should be able to be pulled along the ice by two men;
a wllifiletrec or drawbar is needed for this purpose. If pull-
ed behind any type of motor vehicle a trailer hitch will be
neccssary. A supply of hot water is needed close to the rink.

For the hot-water treatment, the desired temperature
should be below twenty degrees Fahrenheit, although it will
still work with temperatures as high as twenty-seven de-
grees—twenty-eight degrees, if the conditions are right.
Application is simple. Just fill the drum with hot water and
start drawing the machine over the ice in the same manner
as mowing a lawn. Make sure the path of the machine
overlaps a little on the adjacent path. Usually by the time
one coating has been applied to the entire rink, the surface
is ready for another coat.

Towns using this equipment say it gives them the best ice
surface they have ever had. Here are a few helpful hints
they have noted:

0 Use lightweight inexpensive materials.

0 Ask someone familiar with metals and welding to help
with its construction (a school industrial-arts instructor
may be the one—he may be able to have his students make
it as a class project).

0 Build the cradle for the drum to fit the trailer not vice
versa.

0 Balance the drum on the trailer so that it is evenly bal-
anced when the drawbar is at waist level.

0 Place a crossbar at the end of the drawbar to facilitate
pulling the machine; thereby making the operation less tiring.

gear which has adequate traction (ice-grippers, if not too
arge, do a good job).

o Wait until a coating is completely frozen before apply-
ing another.

o Do not leave water in the drum overnight.
0 Make any repairs immediately.

0 See that no one tampch with the machine unless

ateriafs Needed. Model A Ford front axle and wheels
with tires for trailer; 12' angle iron for cradle; 8' wiring
pipe for draw and crossbars; 6' steel strap to hold drum
on cradle, 6’-8' of 11/2” pipe (threaded) for water distri-
bution; 11/3" valve for water distribution control; 2 plugs
(threaded) for ends of distribution pipe; 12-16 shower
curtain hooks to attach burlap on distribution pipe; 1%"
T (threaded) to connect distribution pipe to valve; 55-gal-
lon drum to hold the hot water; 3” elbow to fill drum; five
or six burlap sacks to conduct water from distribution pipe
to ice; and 6' of 1%” by 1/3” steel stock to stabilize distri-
bution pipe.

Building Procedure. Prepare the 55-gallon drum by at-
taching the three-inch elbow to the corresponding hole in
the top of the drum. Then attach the 11/2” valve to the op-
posite end of the drum at the extreme bottom of the drum-
lead. This valve controls the flow of water from drum to
pipe distributing the water. Use a joint seal on all pipe
lanions. Connect the 11/2” pipe in equal lengths to the T so
that they form a straight length of pipe from six to eight
feet long. Plug the ends of these lengths of pipe with screw
caps. Drill %” holes every three to four inches in a straight
line along the entire length of pipe, including the T. Solder
the shower curtain hooks so that the straight part of the
hook is on the Opposite side of the pipe from the holes and
pointing slightly forty-five degrees away from side of the
pipe which has the opening of the T in it. Solder these
books every six inches so they will not interfere with the
holes on the bottom of the pipe. Connect the T to the valve.

Next build the cradle. The drum will be in this cradle to
keep it stable at all times. The cradle has to fit the trailer
axle. Weld lengths of angle iron together so that you form
a rectangle four inches shorter than the length of your
drum and four inches longer than the width of the drum.
Then weld six-inch lengths of angle iron to the inside of the
rectangle. These pieces should be bent to fit the curve of
the drum and then welded between each of corner posts so
that the drum fits snugly into the slings without rocking.
Two more pieces of the steel strap should then be bent and
placed over the drum to complete the circle of strap around
each end of the drum. The top straps can be attached by
bolts and wing nuts to facilitate removing the drum. Secure
the cradle to the trailer axle. Construct a V of angle iron
from the front corners of drum at the base. Weld a stand-
ard perpendicular to this point, to hold the drawbar eighteen
inches off the ground. Weld a three-foot crossbar to a four-
foot drawbar. Finish the ends of the crossbar so that no

J AHUAIIY 1959

rough edges remain. Weld the drawbar to the point of the
V so that it forms a Y. This should complete the construe-
tion, except for the burlap, which is hooked over the shower
curtain hooks and draped over the front of the distribution
pipe so that water from the pipe is conducted down the bur-
lap onto the surface of the ice. No gaps or spaces should
he allowed in draping the burlap as that would not provide
a uniform coat to the surface of the ice.

The accompanying diagrams illustrate the plan used in
Vermont, by the Waterbury Recreation Committee and the
Brattlehoro Recreation Department, in constructing this
helpfnl ice-coating equipment.

Fort Wayne, Indiana, uses a similar resurfacing machine
and recommends motorcycle rubber tires, 475 by 19, on a
straight axle, a seventy-five or one-hundred gallon drum—
although they have been using a fifty-gallon one—and a
quick-acting shutoff valve. Additional information can be
obtained by writing to Howard Von Gunten or Dave Cillie,
department of parks, Fort Wayne.

Timely Tips for Rink Managers

From Louis Owen, one of the country’s most astute rink
managers (California’s Berkeley Iceland), come a few time-
and money-saving tips for busy rink operators:

Rubber Kickboards. To avoid the unsightly, chewed-up ap-
pearance of the lower section of the rink barrier on the
inside near ice surface, some managers fasten a metal strip
all around the barrier, running about six inches up from the
ice surface. However, this metal protection tends to rust and
also has a tendency to extract heat from the air, so it causes
ice surface to melt directly underneath the strip. A far
better protective device is to use five- or six-inch rubber
belting and tack it on firmly. Seconds or surplus material,
even used belting, will do the trick nicely. This forms per-
feet protection; it is economical, lasts several seasons, gives
protection to wood surface, eliminates unsightly and dan-
gerous conditions sometimes seen when chewed bits of wood
and slivers become imbedded in ice surface.

F or skate shops. Have all your rental skate boots equipped
with extra lacehooks instead of eyelets; that is, continue the
hooks down about three more eyelets than usual. The sav-
ing in time and service will astonish you; also, customers
like the easy-on, easy-off method the extra hooks give.

Ice Cutting Tip. Smoothness and skateability of your ice
depend on the way it is prepared. Berkeley’s lccland uses
the Zamboni Ice-Resurfacing Machine and wouldn’t be with-
out it. if using regular planer remember that a good ‘cut’
is essential and that a good ‘cut' depends on a sharper planer
blade. Time and money are needed to keep your planing
blades in tiptop shape. Using a planer three. four. or five
times daily soon turns the edge of the blade, no matter how
careful you are. flare is a dandy time- and money-saver:
have cutting blades hard-chromed—at least have the actual
cutting edges hard-chromed. Sharpen blade first. then hard-
chrome it, then hone it: the result is a new sharper edge
that will last for months instead of days and is rust-resis-
tant tom—Work! Ice Skating Guide, published by National

IF Evassms, ILLINOIS, is known for
any one sport above all other, it is
swimming. Located as it is on the
shores of Lake Michigan, the commu-
nity recognizes that swimming is essen-
tial for self-preservation, especially in a
locale where boating and seaside recre-
ation are commonplace.

luvanston Township High School is
one of eight schools in Chicagofs im-
mediate suburbs participating in the
Suburban League sports schedule. The
member schools. above average scholas-
tically, are also above average in the
quality of their athletics. Football, bas-
ketball, track, baseball, swimming—
indced, all major sports—provide these
suburban schools with a comprehensive,
year-round competitive athletic pro-
gram teaching sportsmanship and pro-
viding the physical education impera-
tive for teen-agers at the same time.

The school rarcly misses a first division
place in all league sports.

Until recently, while other schools on
a par with Evanston’s enrollment of
3200 students were boasting one, even
two swimming pools, Evanston had
none. Despite this obvious handicap,
the high school was turning out one
championship team after the other,
teams that practiced and held meets at

the local YMCA.

Realizing the necessity for rectifying
this ohvious lack in high school facili-
ties, the board of education got busy
and drawings were begun in 1955. Con-
struction started in 1957, and by early
spring of 1958, the new uatatorium was
completed, at an approximate construc'
tion cost of $925,000. Evanston High
now has a swimming facility far su-
perior to that of most, or perhaps all,
communities in the country. The nata-
torium provides all the facilities neces-
sary for a school, and, indeed, for the
community.

above average? The answer is that here
was an example of a community that
knew what it wanted; one that cooper-
ated with the architects to achieve truly
exciting results. Basic plans included
everything necessary for the construc-
tion of any facility—swimming pool or
other; facilities were planned to imple-
ment a known program; excellent work-
manship and durable materials contri-
buted plus values. Added to these, and
imperative for swimming facilities, was
the incorporation of safety features in
both design and equipment. Beyond
these more commonplace basics, was
Evanton’s demand for an attractive
pool, that could be used by the entire
community, as well as the school, and a
pool suitable to a community stressing
not only swimming meets, swim shows,
and other spectator activities, hut also
social swimming and instruction for all
ages.

Actually, the swimming unit contains
two pools and is connected to other
building units by a glass-enclosed eor-
ridor. A practice pool, 30' by 60', com-
pletely shallow, with the depth varying
from 3’0” to 4’5”, is useful for prelim-
inary instruction. It also serves as a
warm-up pool during meets—a delight
to coaches. A continuous deck ties this
pool to the exhibition or main pool but
aluminum rolling doors may separate
pools when two independent activities
occur simultaneously. The doors re-
main open during swim meets, public
recreation swimming, and instruction
classes for youngsters of pre-high-
school age.

The exhibition pool is 75' by 45'—
slightly wider than the 42' standard.
This extra width is picked up by the two

outside lanes, to eliminate the handicap
under which swimmers drawing out-
side lanes usually compete. The depth
range is 3'6” to 12'8". Turquoise blue,
the basic color of the pool's lining, en-
riches the water’s natural color. Wide,
white-bordered black stripes mark the
lengthwise lanes. These are crossed, at
right angles, by similar white stripes of
narrower width indicating the lanes
running the width of the pool. The
total effect is that of an interesting
plaid-like pattern on the pool's bottom.

The natatorium is constructed pri-
marily of reinforced concrete founda-
tions and basement. The superstructure
is of steel and masonry. Lowest main-
tenance finish materials were used
throughout; ceramic tile, structural
glazed tile, and aluminum predominate.
Bright, cheerful colors were used, to
give a gay, happy feeling. The deck is
of yellow and tan nonslip ceramic tile;
side walls are warm light grey; doors
have yellow plastic facing, easy to clean
and fun to look at. The room is a far
cry from the old austere, cold, white
bathing pool.

This natatorium has no noisy rever-
berations. The entire ceiling, construct-
ed of corrugated and perforated enam-
eled aluminum, absorbs noise. So does
the face of the balcony railing made of
perforated Transite. A record player
is attached to thc public-address sys-
tem-a useful device for swim shows,
social swimming, and water ballet.
There are speakers in the ceilings of
both pool and locker rooms, with even
an underwater speaker for the exhibi-

The Fight

Goes On— s: as s

The New York State Puhlic \Vorks
Department is still trying to wrest four
hundred acres away from the state’s
Adirondack Forest Preserve, in order
to run the right of way for the North-
way, the toll-free expressway now being
built from Albany to Plattsbnrgh. The

tion pool. Lighting is incandescent with
high-level downlights. All lights are
accessible for relamping from truss
space above. Special ventilation in-
side truss spaces prevents condensa-
tion. Wall and ceiling ventilation as-
sure maximum humidity control. To
insure comfort for swimmers and spec-
tators alike, warmer air is circulated at
pool and deck level rather than in thc
halcony area.

Water in the pools is heated to ap-
proximately seventy-cight degrees.
Chlorine and soda ash are added in
measured amounts to maintain proper
residual chlorine and alkalinity levels.
The large pool has two surflex filters;
the small pool has one snrflex filter.
Water is completely circulated every
six hours. i

Balcony seating accommodates ap-
proximately one thousand persons. The
seating is U shaped, thereby concentrat-
ing seating around the shallow end of
the exhibition pool where all races be-
gin and end. An innovation is the
seorer’s balcony at the deep end. An
electric time clock and scoreboard
mounted above scorer’s balcony is a
wonderful substitute for shouting from
the deck.

Drinking fountains and spittoons are
built in. Of the three diving boards
provided, two are one meter and one is
three meter, which can be adjusted to
one meter when necessary.

Class-time supervision is facilitated
by two instructors’ offices, one for boys
and one for girls, located on opposite
sides of the exhibition pool. ‘Vhen the

 

legislatures with an intervening elec-
tion.

Unfortunately, a pr0posed amend-
ment slipped by the last session of the
state legislature, with only token resis-
tance from conservation people. flow-
ever, since then, conservation groups
have been mustcring forces and have
aroused considerable support for an al-
ternate route. At least a dozen groups,
including the state’s Federated Garden
Clubs, the Adirondack Mountain Club,
the State Forest Preserve Association,
and the State Conservation Forum, have
endorsed the alternate or Champlain
route. Two other organizations were

partition separating the two pools is
closed, instructors may still supervise
both pools through the polarized glass
walls of the offices. This polarization
takes the surface sheen off the water;
thus, all activity above or below the
surface may he watched at all times.

Two locker rooms, a boys’ and a
girls’, each have access to both pools.
Structural tile partitions of the showers
reach halfway to the ceiling. Showers
are thus observahlc from the instruct-
ors’ offices so horseplay may be stopped
hefore accidents occur. fnstructors are
also able to make sure that students take
the required shower before entering
the pool. Walls and floors of locker and
shower areas are of colorful ceramic
tile. The boys’ locker room has seven-
teen shower heads and 162 full-length
lockers. Girls’ locker room has sev-
enteen shower heads, 145 full-length
lockers and fourteen hair dryers. All
mirrors are full length.

The Evanston natatorium has been in
use now for almost a year. In addition
to regular school swimming activities,
a year-round community program is al-
ready in effect. There are swimming les-
sons and recreation swims for children
and adults alike. Girl Scouts, Boy
Scouts, lied Cross, clubs, and fraterni-
ties all use the pool. To raise funds for
their organizations, the Evanston PTA
used the pool for a style show, while the
Dad's Club prcsented a water circus.
The Evanston High School natatorium
is truly an example of swimming facili-
ties used and loved by school and com-
munity alike. #

even more forceful. The Appalachian
Mountain Club and the Schenectady
County Conservation Council have
voted opposition to allowing the North-
way on forest preserve land at all.

A nice distinction must he made
here: There is an imaginary blue line
encircling the forest preserve, which
both routes will touch, but the alternate
route does not touch upon any of the
state land within that blue line and thus
does not require an amendment. Only
public land within that line is subject to
the “forever wild” requirement. Advo-
cates of both routes have armed them-
selves with plausible, cogent rcasons.#

NOTES

Inventory of City-Owned Land

Royal Oak, Michigan (71,000), has completed an inven-
tory of all city-owned land to aid recreation planning and
other future development. Compiled by city employees, the
inventory is available in book form for ready reference.

The book is in three sections: city recreation and park
lands; city land for fire stations, pumping stations, and
other nonrecreation purposes; and areas used as planting
strips, boulevards, and parkways. All sites are cross-
indexed by number and subdivision for reference, and each
site is noted on four accompanying maps keyed to differ-
entiate between dedicated and nondedicated parcels.

A descriptive sheet is included for each park and recrea-
tion site, with data on site number, acreage, whether dedi-
cated or not, street location, legal description, recreation
equipment and facilities, appraised value and date of ap-
praisal, stage of development, long-range recommendations
for deveIOpment and by whom made, date of inventory,
and other reference information. The city already has
found it helpful in recreation planning, park development,
and property trades and negotiations—Public Manage-
ment, August, 1958.

Persistent Board Member

Thanks to the initiative and persistence of a former mem-
ber of the Honolulu (Hawaii) Board of Public Parks and
Recreation, the city has regained a lost park. During World
War II a Japanese Shinto mission transferred a small park
to the recreation division, which paid off the mortgage,
amounting to $2,478. The city then spent $22,000 improv-
ing the park. In 1952 the city board of supervisors deeded
the park back to the reorganized Shinto group for $2,478,
completely ignoring the investment made by the city on
the property. A taxpayer’s suit was thrown out of court by
the circuit judge.

In appealing the case, a former board member claimed
the transfer was illegal because it was “for a grossly inade-
quate consideration, being, in reality, an unauthorized gift
of public property,” and that the land could only be sold
at public auction. 11] supporting the appeal the Territorial
Supreme Court ruled the city had committed “constructive
fraud” in selling, for $2,478, preperty appraised at $46.9?7.
It, therefore, ordered the officials to nullify the deed and
refund the money to the mission.

Recommends Joint-Use

A state committee on health, physical education, and rec-
reation submitted the following recommendation to the
New Mexico State Board of Education:

“Providing instruction in the worthwhile use of leisure-
time activities during and after school is one of the prin-
cipal objectives of the public schools. This goal can be

32

realized most effectively by planning, constructing, and
operating the schools as neighborhood and community
centers, and by providing for the maximum utilization of
gymnasjums, auditoriums, workshops, lihraries, classrooms,
park areas, and play fields for after-school, year-round
activities, for all children and youth and community groups.
Therefore, we urge school superintendents, city and county
officials, to coordinate their efforts in acquiring and design-
ing facilities, and in formulating legal agreements for the

fullest use of such school-community centers for educa-
tional-reereational programs.”

Soviet City Planning

William S. Foster, editor of The American City, report-
ing on a visit to the Soviet Union by a group of United
States architects, commented on the handicaps owing to
lack of skilled craftsmen and equipment. He added, “De-
spite these difficulties, Soviet city planning shows a great
deal of thought, and seems based on the classic ‘garden
city’ concept. Each project is grouped to serve populations
varying from ten thousand to twenty-five thousand. Rough-
ly, twenty per cent of the land is occupied by buildings;
forty per cent is by landscaping; and another forty per cent
by parks'and similar facilities. Areas for schools are in ad-
dition to this land area. Each of the large projects is sepa-
rated by a park, and several would be grouped around a
central building of some sort, such as a stadium.”

Private Use of City Land

It is legally possible for the city to make a site on a
public park, acquired by the city either by purchase or
condemnation, available to private organizations for the
construction of a senior citizens’ service and recreation
center on certain terms and conditions, including execu-
tion of a lease for a term not to exceed twenty-five years,
provision that the use of the building shall be limited to
recreation activities and purposes, provision that the senior
citizens be entitled to primary use of the facility, subject
to the right of the public and citizens of the city to the use
thereof, provision that all uses of the facility be subject to
the control and administration of the city through its legis-
lative body, and that the lease agreement provide for ap-
priate rental—ALLEN CRIMES, city attorney, Modesto, Cali-

fronia, April 14, 1958. Western City, August, 1958.

Golf Negligence Decision

Freak Shot. A California case, Oahes vs. Chapman, early
this year, found a golfer not guilty of negligence in hitting
a ninety-degree “freak” shot, causing severe eye injury to
another player on a municipal golf course. In the plain-
tiff’s attempt to prove negligence, it was brought to light
that the defendant had suffered from infantile paralysis at
the age of two and had been left with certain crippling
effects. However, the court ruled that any warning would
have been superfluous, because neither party knew, or had
reason to believe, that the ball would go ninety degrees off
course, and there was no evidence of negligence. It was
indeed, a “freak” shot!

RECREATION

F___

 ammo

’1‘ One of the most important future
aspects of our profession—recreation
for the homebound ill and handicapped
—is finally gaining national consider-
tion. in 1 'ovember, Arthur S. Flemming,
secretary, U. S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, held a confer-
ence with individuals and organizations
directly interested in rehabilitation.
The meeting’s main emphasis was that
the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation
is sorely limited in its services to the
handicapped because it can work only
with vocational rehabilitation.

The majority of chronically ill pa-
tients cannot be vocationally rehabili-
tated, and, consequently, need much
help in finding a way to lead a full life.
To all of us this, of course, means
recreation.

it was suggested that, in order to
conduct research and give service to
this large homebound group, the oliice
changed its name to Oliice of Rehabilita-
tion, thus not limiting its endeavors. I
have constantly emphasized this point
as well as the fact that the twenty-nine
home-care programs and the dozens of
rehabilitation services and clinics in
our country do little or nothing about
bringing organized recreation to the
homehound through the use of commu-
nity agencies, organizations, and vol-
unteers under professional direction.
We are currently setting up two demon-
stration projects in community plan-
ning for the homebound. If you are in-
terested, write me for information.

’1‘ Our four pilot projects in New York
City introducing recreation to combin-
ed groups of nursing homes—housing
three hundred patients—are doing
splendidly. We have actually succeeded
in proving that, by combining hnancial
resources and jointly paying the salary
for professional personnel and basic
equipment, every nursing home can
have recreation at minimal cost.

in the city we estimate we can bring
these patients many recreation activi-
ties. conducted by volunteers under the
supervision of a professional leader, for
less than two dollars per patient per
month, judging by results of the last six
months. Our problem now is: How
much will it cost for adequate service
to smaller, more typical nursing homes?
We are currently publicizing our proj-
ects as much as possible, and our next

isxuaav 1959

 

Beatrice 11. Hill

step is to try and establish the legal
precedent that new nursing homes can-
not be licensed unless they provide rec-
reation, and that old ones must sUpply
some kind of recreation activity despite
Space limitations. Finally, is there any
reason why the private patient or the
welfare department should not share the
cost of recreation with the nursing-
bome owner?

’1‘ In a New Jersey town of five thous-
and, where we were asked to set up a
program of recreation for the ill and
handicapped, we are combining a
county hospital, a welfare home, and
two nursing homes into one project. We
are forming a council of recreation f0r
the ill and handicapped, composed of
the mayor, a member of the governing
body, the executive directors of the
local welfare, health, and charitable or-
ganizations, the administrators of the
hospital and the welfare home, and
owners of the two nursing homes. This
council will study the needs of the insti-
tutions and will then use this study to
approach local industries, as well as
state fund administrators to finance the
salaries of professional recreation per-
sonnel. The one or more professional
recreation workers will be attached to
the welfare department, as there is no
recreation department. The recreation
therapists’ main function will be to set
up programs, recruit, train and super-
vise volunteers to carry out a well-
rounded program of recreation: to the
institutionalized. Eventually, we hope
we can also work with the homebonnd.
The local high school is giving credit to
any of the students wishing to work in
this project as volunteers.

’1‘ ln your hospital work,are you think-
ing about the great importance of ob-
taining staff to work on a consultancy
basis with your discharged patients,
particularly those with chronic physical
illnesses, or mental patients? This staff
member should investigate the town or
area to which the patient will be return-
ing. and then find out what recreation
activities exist. in which he can par-
ticipate.

OUR EXPANDING POPULATION

The Exploding Metropolis, The Editors
of Fortune, Doubleday & Company,
Garden City, New York. Pp. I93.
$3.95. The Suburban Community, Wil-
liam M. Dobriner, Editor. G. P. Put-
nam's Sons, 210 Madison Avenue, New

York 16. Pp.4I6. $6.50.

These two volumes are among the
latest additions to the growingliterature
dealing with problems of our rapidly
CXpanding metropolitan regions. They
differ widely, however, in SCOpe and
make-up. The Expioding Metropolis is
issued “for people who like cities and a
critique of the plans of people who
don’t.” The book, which originally ap-
pcared as a series of articles in Fortune
magazine, deals with the tremendous
and largely chaotic growth of cities and
suburbs. It pays Special attention to
urban redevelopment programs and
calls for an immediate and drastic re-
evaluation, with a view tO serving more
effectively the diverse and complex re-
quirements Of our Citizens. Emphasis
is laid upon planning Cities for people
and the importance of recreation space
and methods Of acquiring it. The book
is readable and illustrated with pen and
ink sketches Of city streets, squares, and
buildings, with clear, explanatory Cap-

tions.

The Suburban Community, on the
other hand, is a “sourcebook of the
sociological patterns that shape the
lives of forty million Americans.” It
discusses the theory of sociology in the
suburbs and describes research related
to the social, political, and economic
pattern of suburban life. The chapters,
contributed by a long list Of individ-
uals, deal with the growth of the suburb,
its sociology, social organization, life
styles, problems, and perspectives. More
than one article deals with leisure in_t_he
suburbs, but it is significant that the
comprehensive index contains no refer-
ence to either parks or recreation.—
George Butler, director, NRA Research
Department.

stractionists, Imprcssionists, Expres-
