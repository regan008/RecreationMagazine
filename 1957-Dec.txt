For every sound reproduCtion
application in recreation halls,
gyms, auditoriums, or summer
camps, the Newcomb R-16CV
does the job better, yet weighs
less than 22 pounds. A separate
microphone and phonograph
volume control permits mixing
recorded music with the micro-
phone presentation. Variable
speed control allows variable
tempo and pitch (from any basic
speed setting). A quality heat
and humidity resistant high
fidelity ceramic pickup .is encased
in a professional-type tone arm.

’ Balanced-design amplifier with
inverse feedback in combination
with a fine ten-inch extended
range speaker give quality you'd
never expect at its price. Newcomb
is the "sound of quality since
1937”. . . recognized by leading

, school authorities from coast

_ coast to coast.

NEWCOMB VARIABLE SPEED

Exclusive Newcomb design gives
dependable centinuously variable
control at all 3 speeds.

Recreation Philosophy
Sirs: '

The editorial by Colonel Roland E.
Sliker in your October issue is of con-
siderable interest to us in the Air Ma-
teriel Command. We have been one of
the first commands to subscribe to the
philosOphy of a professional recreation
manager for the air base under our con-

trol, and we are actively selling this
philosophy to all of our commanders.

To further inform our commanders
and recreation personnel in the field,
we would like to reproduce Colonel
Sliker’s editorial in our own Military
Personnel Career Facts Bulletin. This
is our monthly publication devoted to
keeping our military personnel inform-
ed on all matters pertaining to an Air
Force career.

It will be appreciated very much if
you will permit us to reproduce Colonel
Sliker’s editorial in our next issue. We
are asking you for this authority since

we would like to cite your publication
as the source of our quotation.

For Our Senior Citizens

Sirs:

The article “Adapting Dancing for
Senior Citizens” by Cyrus 5. Crossman
in the October, 1957 issue inspires us
to write to you expressing our deep ap-
preciation for the outstanding work
RECREATION has been doing in stimulat-
ing the recreation movement for senior
citizens. During the past few years this
magazine has given desirable emphasis
to stimulating recreation directors to
serve this growing segment of our popu-
lation. We feel confident that much of

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

—The Editors.

the recent interest by local recreation
people in this field has been due in large
measure to the stimulus received from
your magazine.

Because this particular area of rec-
reation is developing so rapidly, there
is now an immediate need for (a) devel-
opment of standards for recreation cen-
ters for the elderly; (b) the provision
of model designs for the construction
of such centers; (c) development of
basic lists of equipment; (d) develop-
ment of closer liaison between the rec-
reation professionals and the adult edu-
cation people; and (e) training of rec-
reation personnel in dealing with human
beings in their later years of life.

York State Joint Legislative Com-

Use for “Prunings”

Sirs:

In the parks of Wilmington, we have
two very fine public rose gardens. It
has recently been decided that, when
these fine plants are pruned, the clip-
pings will be laid on the ground in
front of each plant and will then be
collected in such a way that various
small bundles of clippings will repre-
sent dillerent plants. These packages
will be distributed, gratis, through our
Negro garden club for their members
to plant in their yards or flower gardens.

I wrote to one of my friends in Cin-
cinnati with regard to this idea, and
here is a quote from his reply on the
subject: “Your idea of making ‘prun-
ings'J that would otherwise be wasted
available without cost is a ‘knockout.’
I wonder how many park commission-
ers have been thoughtful enough to put

@hriatmaa...1957

Robert E. Kresge

The world has moved on from the simplicity of the first
Christmas. There is no denying the fact that Christmas
now takes a beating from the world of commerce. The
steady din of Christmas music from store fronts and street
corners, the endless sending of cards and buying of gifts,
the emphasis on glitter and fancy wrappings—all of these,
and more, tend to make of Christmas a holiday with em-
phasis on things, even though its origin is spiritual.

And yet, Christmas manages to surmount this eXploitation
and its results each year. It is simply too great an event
to be diminished by little man. It always manages to make
man bigger, by causing him to think more about the wel-
fare of others. The more of this he does, the more of self
he loses and the better he feels. And so is born the Christ-
mas spirit, which is the opposite of selfishness.

The Christ Child, whose birthday this is, was born 1,961
years ago, in circumstances which never cease to touch our
hearts; but that was just the beginning! The life of truth
and grace that followed is the reason that Christmas is still
observed. It was the origin of Christianity. The “Christ-
mas Spirit’ is strangely similar to the life of Christ on earth!
It is only when we recall this fact that we realize the reality

of Christmas. l‘

Could it be that God chooses to ennoble us as we cele-
brate the birth of the infant Jesus? ' i

What comfort by Him do we win,
Who made Himself the price of sin,

,
t if"

To make us heirs of glory!

To see this Babe all innocence,
A Martyr born in our defence,

Can. man. forget the story?

—BEN Jonson (1573-1637)

Yes, Christmas is a time of good feeling, of kindness and
of love. It is the time for observing the ancient traditions
of the season and the message, “Peace on earth, good will to
men.” That is the beauty of Christmas. Let us do as Mary
did, and “ponder these things” in our hearts.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

} FEATURE STORIES on recreation and
related subjects are still appearing in
popular magazines. Two appeared in
The Saturday Evening Post in Septem-
ber. “They Befriend the Mentally 111,”
by Steven M. Spencer, in the Septem-
ber 5 issue, told what warm-hearted
volunteers from college campuses can
do for mental patients in hospitals;
while “lndependent at Sixty-Five,” by
Arnold Nicholson, in the September 21
issue, was about special housing pro-
jects for older folks in New York State.
Another, in Redbook in July, “The Most
Rewarding Night of Our Week” by Jean
Stewart with Arthur Gordon, tells a
similar story of a young couple volun-
teering with the mentally ill. -

} WHAT VOLUNTEERS CAN no for a pris-
on program is amply illustrated by the
Wide citizen support for a recreation
program in the new state prison in Wal-
pole, Massachusetts. This is reported
in Channels, a publication of the Na-
tional Publicity Council for Health and
Welfare Services. More than eighty per
cent of the prison population is engaged
in a hobby program led by business-
men, doctors, lawyers, and school teach-
ers, some of whom were among the
strongest opponents of the institution.

} UNITED STATES POPULATION is now
170,981,000. The total population,

including Armed Forces overseas, was
about 170,981,000 on June 1, 1957, ac-
cording to recent estimates by the Cen-
sus Bureau. This figure represcnts an

increase of 19,849,000, or 13.1 per cent,
since April 1, 1950, the date of the last
census, and a 3,047,000, or 1.8 per cent

348

7% @wSWKmH

increase over the estimate for June

1956.

} Formation of a new voluntary organ-
ization to stimulate international un-
derstanding through sponsorship of in-
ternational projects in rehabilitation
of the physically handicapped was an-
nounced recently. This is the world

Rehabilitation Fund, lnc., of which
Howard A. Rusk, M.D., who is well-
known to many recreation people, is
president. Its offices are at 400 East

34th Street, New York 16.

} STARTLING FIGURES from a recent
Gallup Poll indicate that forty-five mil-
lion Americans cannot swim—fourteen
million of these are men. Swimming in-
structors, where are you? Sampling a
cross-section of adults from coast to
coast, the American Institute of Public
Opinion discovered that seventy-seven
per cent (if the men and fifty-two per
cent of the women have had the opportu-
nity to learn. This leaves twenty-three
per cent of the men and forty-eight
per cent of the women still waiting for
someone to help them.

) THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A “NEW CON-
CEPT” in legislation governing thc rec-
reation of some 30,000,000 Americans
has been taken by the Outboard Boating
Club of America with announcement of
its new recommended Uniform Pleasure
Boating Act. The suggested act, in-
tended to serve as a guide for federal
and state lawmakers studying possible
enactment of new measures aHecting
boating, is the initial move in the com-
pilation of an Omnibus Boating Code
which will be offered as a broad master
plan for recommended legislative regu-
lation of the fast growing sport.

The existing federal boating law pro-
vides for a fine of $2,000 and/or a
jail term of one year for negligent or
careless operation of a motorboat. The
acknowledged harshness of present pen-
alties has resulted in all but the most
flagrant cases going unpunished. The
new proposal would strengthen marine
enforcement by addition of a less severe
but more acceptable penalty by allowing

the court to order a violator off th
water for up to two years.

The SECREATION CONGRESS STORY '

*—""'I-

    
   

To CREET the nation’s recreation lead-

ers as they gathered in Southern
California for the 39th National Recre-
ation Congress, Long Beach Haunted its
best weather—clear skies, dazzling sun
and blue ocean. The vastness of the
Pacific seemed to symbolize the wider

‘horizons to be achieved at the meetings
ahead. The tropical atmosphere was
further enhanced by palm trees, gay
flower gardens, and the trays of orchid
corsages brought from Hawaii by Ethel
Mori for the Congress banquet. (The
latter reminded us of the Seattle Con-
gress when Mrs. Manuel from Hono-
lulu presented leis—and kissed the male
guests in the process. Ah, these attrac-
tive Hawaiians!)

The beautiful weather held all week,
to everyone’s delight, for it was neces-
sary to get from hotel to hotel in the
fastest possible way—by scooter, skip,
or Pogo stick. Through necessity, ex-
hibits and large general meetings had
to be held in the Municipal Auditorium
by the sea, while other sessions were
in the hotels, recreation center, and a
high school—in as many different di-
rections. In spite of this, recreation
folks turned out by the hundreds—as
they always do. Attendance totalled
1,792 persons.

While casting a reflective eye over
Congress Week, the perspective of time
makes it obvious that this session will
be a long-remembered milestone in the
recreation field for two important rea-

sons. It was the first National Recrea-
tion Congress to be co-sponsored by a
number of recreation organizations;
notably, the California Recreation So-
ciety, Los Angeles County Park and
Recreation Department, Long Beach
Recreation Commission, American Rec-
reation Society and National Recrea-
tion Association—rather than by the
National Recreation Association alone,
as during the past fifty years. In spite
of so many fingers in the pie, however,
this one went off with a minimum of
confusion. This Congress will be re-
membered, too, because of the general
agreement, born out by the week’s pro-
gram, that the field of recreation has
reached a peak of importance never be-
fore realized—a result of the rapidly
increasing leisure in this era of auto-
mation.

Dr. Paul Douglass, author, govern-
ment consultant and old friend of rec-
reation, brought this out forcibly in his
notable address, “The Next Hundred
Years,” at the general session on Thurs-
day morning. He emphasized the need
for a realignment of national thinking
about recreation and its relation to our
culture. “The assimilation of leisure into
the folkways of tomorrow makes essen-
tial the reconstruction of the goals and
values of life,” he said.

This was just a few days before the
advent of Sputnik into our planet’s
skies, as Dr. Douglass was pointing
out the great good and great evil, at
the same time, of our twentieth cen-
tury. He spoke of the miracles which,
on the one hand, have released man

from drudgery and the fetters which
have shackled him to the earth, and, on
the other, have “unfolded a deepening
horror” and the possibility of untold
savagery. “The look forward to another
century has always been the occasion
for evaluation and forecast,” he stated
as he eXpressed the concern of all of us
for the kind of world in which our chil-
dren—and some of us—shall live in the
twenty-first century.

Program Gets Under Way

The activities of Congress Week were
led off by a grand opening of the more
than one hundred exhibits, commercial
and educational, on Monday morning,
with a ribbon-cutting ceremony con-
ducted by Long Beach’s Mayor Ray
Kealer, and William Frederickson, Jr.,
president of the California Recreation
Society and superintendent of the Los
Angeles City Department of Parks and
Recreation.

At the general session which immedi-
ately followed, Joseph Prendergast,
NRA executive director, officially open-
ed the 39th Congress in his capacity as
chairman of the Congress Committee
and called on all Congress participants
to lead a crusade to alert the nation to
save recreation lands threatened by
subdivisions, superhighways and park-
ing lots. The Reverend Robert (Bob)
Richards, renowned champion athlete,
was the principal session speaker and
paid stirring tribute to the character-
building values of recreation, using the
field of sports as an illustration be-
cause “this is a phase of recreation with

which I am most familiar.” (He has
been a member of three Olympic teams.)
“Give me a playground or a gymna-
sium,” he said, “and I will do more to
help boys and girls than I can from the
pulpit,” and he pointed out the won-
derful opportunity which recreation
leaders have to do this.

Present on the stage were members
of the National Congress Committee,
who were introduced individually by
Mr. Prendergast. Flags of the forty-
eight states and Canada formed a back-
ground for the speakers, and official
representatives of state governors were
seated in the audience. They and the
Canadian guests and foreign delegates
present were asked to stand for recog-
nition. The audience was seated ac-
cording to states. Dr. Frank M. Kepner,
pastor of the First Baptist Church in
Long Beach, pronounced the invocation.

Speakers at other general sessions in-
cluded Dr. W. Ballentine Henley, edu-
cator and civic leader, who spoke on
“Exploring New Recreational Fron-
tiers”; Dr. Vierling Kersey, active mem-
ber of the Los Angeles City Recrcation
and Parks Commission, who gave the
banquet address on “Citizens Offer
Leadership in American Recreation”;
and Dr. Harold W. Kennedy, the coun-
sel for the County of Los Angeles, who
addressed the closing session on “The
Philosophy of Recreation and Its Legal
Aspects.” Dr. Henley traced the social
and industrial developments which have
led to today’s increase of leisure and
emphasized the fact that more profes-
sional recreation leaders are needed
now and even more will be needed soon ;

350

 

while Dr. Kersey set the gay mood of
the banquet with his rollicking humor.

At the closing session, Dr. Kennedy
reminded delegates that the enjoyment
of recreation is legally the right of all
pe0ple. He further cited recreation as a
vital defense against communism.
“Happy people are likely to critically in-
spect alternative ways of life,” he said.
“As we face the uncertain tomorrow
against the tragic backdrop of the ap-
palling catastrophic possibilities of de-
struction in the atomic age, we need no
further arguments for the importance

of recreation.” ‘

In all phases of program for the week,
the follow-through on this emphasis was
the sharp challenge to workers to re-
cruit promising young people for ur-
gently needed leadership in this impor-
tant field and to enlist more lay under-
standing and support.

There were over one hundred sessions
at the Congress—which gives some
idea of the program’s especially wide
scope. For a few highlights of these
see “Congress Briefs,” page 354.

Spccial meetings of all sorts were
held, some as a part of the streamlined
Congress program and some added
thereto. The sessions on “Recreation
for the III and the Handicapped,” as set
up by the NRA Hospital Recreation
Consultation Service, madc up one very
effective section of the Congrcss.

Wives had a special room of their
own to use as headquarters and their
own program—although wives seemed
to be attending morc regular sessions
than ever before.

Another was the Armed Forces Sec-
tion of the ABS, which had its own con-
ferences, chaired by Lt. Colonel Don-
ald M. Kupfer, deputy chief of Person-
nel Services Division, Headquarters Air
Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base,
Colorado. Dorothy Clemens, staff serv-
ice club director for Fifteenth Air
Force, served as program chairman.

Workshops and Demonstrations

These again proved a p0pular type of
meeting, and a desire to add more of
them next year was expressed. They
included such sessions as:

Day Campng in (2 Recreation Setting.
This was an outdoor demonstration and

exhibit. Overnight a day camp appear-
ed on the lawn of the Municipal Audi-
torium, through the handwork of a spe-
cial Day Camp Committee and cooper-
ation of the Southern California Camp-
ing Association. Well-planned and in-
formally conducted, and chaired by
Esther G. Bristol, program advisor for
the Los Angeles Camp Fire Girls, this
ofiered much to stimulate interest, ideas
and to give information in this program
area. Outstanding day camp directors
from public and private camps were on
hand to explain, teach or advise. Sam-
ples of lashing, camper-made equip-
ment, nature crafts, r0pemaking, trail
making and types of outdoor cooking
equipment were among those display-
ed. Crafts demonstrations were given
and, in a sanded area, various outdoor
cooking recipes were carried out. using
different types of fires, ovens and im-
provised equipment. Delicious cookery
samples were fed to the delegates.

Bulletins on nature games, camping
standards, and recipes were available to
those interested.

Music. This meeting was presided over
by Mrs. Virginia Clark, director of
drama, music and rhythms for the Long
Beach Recreation Commission, and pre-
sented our old friend, Dr. Frederick
Hall——who could make even the furni-
ture want to sing. Dr. Hall, as you re-
memhcr, has lcd Congress demonstra-
tions in St. Louis and Denver and is di-
rector of the music division at South-
ern University, Baton Rouge, Louisi-
ana. The session included, of coursc,
demonstrations of his very effective
song leadership. “We have spent years
producing performers and not enough
time producing ‘conslnners,’ ” said Dr.
Hall. “We need more new ideas today
to help us revitalize rccreation through

excellent Bureau of Music in Los An-
geles, reinforced by members of his

music.”

youth choruses, then progrcssing to
adult choruses and community sings.
The bureau’s slogan is, “More music
for more people.” It uses school facili-
ties and most of its directors are school
music teachers.

Dr. Fletcher Hodges, Jr., curator of
Foster Memorial Hall, University of

RECREATION

Pittsburgh, told of an Opportunity to
obtain a beautiful eleven-page boOklet,
Songs of Stephen Foster, free of charge.
Write to him at the university, using
yoUr official letterhead and telling him
the number of c0pies you can use with
your choral groups. The booklet con-
tains words, tunes and accompaniments,

and information about each song.

Underwater Recreation, Scuba and Skin
Diving. This fascinating session was
conducted'by two co-chairmen, Lt. Don
St. Hill, chief diving officer of the Los
Angeles County Department of Parks
and Recreation, and Al Tillman, pro-
fessor of recreation at Los Angeles
State College. The Los Angeles depart-
ment leads the rest of the country in

this activity.*

Creative Dramatics. Mrs. Howard Brau-
cher of the National Recreation Associ-
ation presided, and a demonstration
was presented by Agnes Haaga, director
of creative dramatics at the University
of. Washington, with a group of twenty-
four Long Beach children from the
fourth, fifth and sixth grades. Miss

* A new book, The Science of Skin and
Scuba Diving, is reviewed on page 387.

  

   

Wanted: A Builder

As preparation for the session on
“How to be a Better Recreation
Board Member,” chairman Mrs.

Paul Gallagher of Omaha, board

member of the National Recreation

 

 

 

 

Association, asked professional rec-

 

reation directors in the Midwest to

 

give their opinions as to the quali-
ties most needed in board mem-

 

 

bers. To encourage freedom of
Speech she suggested that the Opin-
ions be unsigned. The following is

 

 

 

one of these opinions.

 

On every board there should be

a person with ideas to the future

a watchdog or financial wizard

a builder

a grouch

a leader‘of the board

an arbitrator

a listener

a person who wants to know why

a liberalist

a dreamer

a walking law library

a lover of children

a really, really cool cat to keep up
with the times

and, finally, someone to pick up the

check at the board dinners.

Haaga showed how 'this 'activity can
touch off a child’s imagination and pro'-
vide an outlet for social and emotional
experiences. The children learned that
c’ostume‘s, sets, make-up, props and lines
are not necessary for drama, that a
character must grow by feeling it from
the inside, and that actions can tell a
story better than words.

Dance Symposium. NRA’s Helen Daun-
cey, Katherine F. Barker Memorial Sec-
retary for Women and Girls, presided.
Leaders were: ballet, Maria Fielding,
supervising recreation specialist of the
San Diego Park and Recreation De-
partment, with six members of her
senior grOUp demonstrating; ballroom,
Mrs. Mae Mathers, activity director of
girls, women’s and co-recreational ac-
tivities for the Long Beach Recreation
Commission, with junior-high-school
boys and girls; folk dancing, Dr. J. Till-
man Hall, director of recreation at the
University of Southern California, with
his group of forty older and younger
dancers (these dancers know one hun-
dred and fifty dances, from many coun-
tries); modern dance, Dr. Lola Sad-
lo, recreation director-specialist of the
Los Angeles City Parks and Recreation
Department, with a group of fifth- and
sixth grade girls whom she had not seen
before; square dancing, Robert Van
Antwerp, district sUpervisor 0f the Long
Beach Recreation Commission, using
the audience as participants.

Among other workshops and demon-
strations were: “Rhythmical Expres-
sion for the Hospitalized,” chaired by
Dr. Edith L. Ball, assistant professor of
education at New York University, with
a demonstration by Helen M. Hocker,
assistant professor of physical educa-
tion and recreation at Washburn Uni-
versity and consultant of the Menninger
Foundation, Topeka, Kansas; “Crea-
tive Crafts,” with demonstrations pre-
sented by Mrs. Frances "Werschkul,
crafts director of the Bureau of Parks

and Public Recreation, Portland, Ore-
gon, and Frank A. Staples, NRA direc-

tor of arts and crafts (the Portland

an impressive list of consultants.

Exhibits

This year the exhibits included dis-
plays of both commercial and educa-
tional materials, thus offering execu-
tives and those leaders wise enough to
plan time for browsing a wealth of new
ideas. The hig room in the Municipal
Auditorium was gay and colorful, its
carnival air enhanced by the trying out
of equipment and the usual serving of
free soft drinks by our old friends,
Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, and Seven-Up

we hope you saw the prospectus for the
construction of a “playshore” area in
Montebello, California. This is to be
a new and unusual play area by the
sea. (More 'about these plans may ap-
pear in a future issue of RECREATION.)

Also, in the same section, did you
try to solve the mystery of the unknown
game? The recreation department in
Redondo Beach, California, was asking
for help. Recently, a local family
presented a game to Fred Tweedy, city
director of recreation, but no one knows
its origin or how to play it. According
to Don Watkins, recreation supervisor,
the game is very old. It is an octangular-
shaped board, having four players using
' “chesslike” men. Action takes place on
an inner circle studded with mother-of-
pearl discs about the size of a dime.

If you recognize the game, please let
them know.

TV and Radio

Radio and television appearances for

Congress delegates were arranged by
the Press Room, and there was quite a
bit of shuffling back and forth to Holly-
wood. On his coast-to-coast television
show, September 30, Lawrence Welk
saluted the Congress, and sixteen Long
Beach boys and girls who were taking
part in the Congress Dance Symposium
made two appearances on his program.
Mr. Prendergast appeared on the four-
teen-state TV program, “Panorama
Pacific,” as did Mrs. Frances Wersch-
kul, crafts director of the Portland Rec-
reation Department. Mrs. Werschkul
also appeared on the “Bill Gwyn” local
television program on KABC. Adah
Donohue, recreation supervisor of San-

ta Monica, appeared on the “Dee Par-
ker Show,” a popular KABC program.

Fred Tweedy, director of recreation, Retlondo

Mr. Prendergast was interviewed on
the Columbia Pacific Network (sixty-
seven radio stations) “Sunday News

Desk,” also on the local “Ruth Ashton
Show.” Ruth Ashton—“Los Angeles’
Answer to Jinx Falkenburg”—did one
show with Willard B. Stone, Congress
secretary, and one with Mrs. Donohue.
Dr. Douglass was interviewed by
Carroll Alcott on his CPN show; and
Reverend Richards was the guest on
Tom Harmon’s CPN sports program.
Coverage in the press included special
interviews and news releases.

Local Arrangements

The Local Arrangements Committee,
chaired by Walter L. Scott, director
of municipal and school recreation of
the Long Beach Recreation Commis-
sion, did an outstanding job; and we
picked up the comment, in San Fran-
cisco later, that this excellent coopera-
tion with visiting conferences is usual
in Long Beach. This year, ushers and
hostesses were provided under the di-
rection of Mrs. Everett M. Findlay,
president of the commission. The spe-
cial hosts who were present at all ses-
sions were provided by the California

Recreation Society and headed up by
Ernest B. Ehrke of Los Angeles. One

of them was always standing by at a
crucial moment. It was helpful, too,
to have the local staff members wearing
identifying amulets on a cord around
their necks so that they could be sorted
out from the crowd. Many thanks to
you, Long Beachers and CRS members.

Innovations

Among other things were the Daily
Iii-Lighter, a free news sheet replacing
the daily Reporter, and the substitution

Reercation” and the

of daily session summaries for a pro-
ceedings this year. Summaries could be
picked up at the Congress, and copies of
the five key speeches could be ordered
in advance, by registered delegates only,
for $1.25. A combination of summaries
and speeches could also be ordered in
advance, for $2.50. (These are now
available from the Association.)

A Hospitality Center for all delegates
was set up by the Long Beach Hospital-
ity Committee in Convention Hall and
on the south terrace of the Municipal
Auditorium. Food and beverages could
be purchased there. Games used by
Long Beach recreation leaders were on
display, also on the outdoor terrace.

Trips and Fun

Tours, special-interest events, and
entertainment might all be said to come
under one heading, because, no matter
how informative or advantageous, these
are also fun. The special-interest events,
of course, included the dinners, break-
fasts, luncheons which were held all
week, all over the place.

The tour of Long Beach park and
recreation facilities afforded delegates

a view of the city and an opportunity
to observe several of its outstanding rec-

Attractive clubhouse
buildings, unusual types of brightly

reation centers.

colored playground apparatus, non-
glare lighted tennis courts, multiple-use

play areas, and the new marina aroused
special interest. Extensive school rec-
reation areas and the exccptional in-
door and outdoor facilities at Long
Beach City College grcatly impressed
the visitors.

Two bus loads of delegates went on

the sightseeing tour of recreation facili-
ties in metropolitan Los Angelcs, on
Saturday, after the Congress was over.
This tour covered over one-hundred

miles and gave visitors an excellent op-
portunity to scc more of the area.
Among the many placcs visitcd, it is
difficult to pick out some that are more
noteworthy than others. However, a
few of the sights included the Los An-
geles Coliseum; Hollywood Bowl; Trav-
el Town, wherc coffee and doughnuts
were servcd through the courtesy of the
Rccreatiou Dircctors Association of the
Los Angeles Recreation and Parks De-

RECREATION

partment; and McCambridge Park in
Burbank. A stop for lunch was made in
Descanso Gardens at Montrose. In the
afternoon the itinerary included the
Rose Bowl, Brookside Park and the
Pasadena Recreation Department. San

Gabriel Mission was not skipped, nor
was the Los Angeles County Parks and
Recreation Department.

An outstanding feature of the tour
was the stop at Descanso Gardens, not

only because of lunch but also for the
beauty of the gardens. Hollywood Bowl,
of course, was of great interest; Mc-
Cambridge Park has a fine new recrea-
tion building and swimming pool. The
system of freeways was interesting to
see, and there were some glimpses of
the mountains. All were impressed with
the great distances.

Among purely social events, begin-
ning Wednesday, a round-up was held
for delegates at the Vessels’ Ranch, in
the evening. This is the home of the fa-
mous Western “quarter horse.” Festivi-
ties took place at the private racetrack
of Mr. Vessels, who offered hospitality
of his facilities to the Long Beach Rec-
reation Department for the occasion. A
wonderful roast beef dinner was served
in front of the ticket windows, a novel
experience for the racing fans present.
Afterwards, guests were invited to the
grandstands to observe the fine program
planned by the local committee. Bob
Van Antwerp acted as master of cere-
monies; and the entertainment included
band music by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Boys’ Band; a rope-twirling
exhibition, courtesy of the Los Angeles
Department of Recreation and Parks; a
thrilling precision drill by Long Beach’s
mounted police with their silver em-
bossed saddles and beautiful palominos.

“Bazaar of Seasonal Themes for the Ill and the Handicapped” was a
humming swap stp of party ideas and materials, with displays of
props and posters. Participants sat at appropriately decorated tables.

 

DECEMBER 1957

One disappointment was the non-ap-
pearance of the “quarter horse.” Mr.
Vessels breeds this small horse which,
as we understand, is the fastest quarter-
mile runner on any track. It was sched-

uled for exhibit, but still remains a
myth—to Eastern guests, at least. Un-
answered are such queries as Bill
Hay’s ** “Do we reckon, by simple
arithmetic, that two horses make eight
quarter-horses?”

A square-dance number on horse-
back was thrilling to watch and was
beautifully executed by the Buttons and

Bows Mounted Square Dance Associa-
tion, after which square dancing for all

was initiated with an exhibition by the
South Coast Square Dance Association.
This proved a colorful and exciting
windup for the evening, with what must
have been hundreds of dancers swing-
ing their partners under-the stars.

Ballroom dancing, with Bob Brun-
ner’s nineteen-piece orchestra, in the
Grand Ballroom of the Lafayette Hotel
after the Congress Banquet on Thurs-

day evening, was fun too-—-with every-
one dressed in their best finery. The
table decorations, done by the local rec-
reation department, were beautiful.

The Friday tour to fabulous Disney-

land was another high point of the
week. This offers four lands in one, all

radiating from the typical Main Street
of Early America, where one can listen
in on a “party line” or see Mabel Nor-
mand and Fatty Arbuckle in their silent
films at the local movie. There i are
many exhibits, shops and stores. The
four lands are: Tomorrowland, with a
rocket-ship trip to the moon; F antasy-

land, where you fly with Peter Pan over
moonlit London and visit Storybook-
land with its miniature homes of such
beloved characters as “Mr. Toad” and

“Three Little Pigs”; Frontierland,
which exhibits America’s pioneer past;

and Adventureland, where boats tour

the mysterious and savage jungles of
the world. Great care has been taken to
make each as authentic as possible.

Delegates had a ball! As tourists for
half a day, they tried them all. . . .

During the week, also, a few persons
managed to get to Marineland, although
no regular tour was arranged. Here they
made the acquaintance of “Bubbles,”
the trained whale with a personality.

According to reports, she is the only
whale in captivity. The porpoises, too,
won everyone’s heart with their smiling
antics—as they always do. Marineland,
incidentally, is said to be “the largest
of the three oceanaria in the world.” It
stands on a rugged cliff just outside of
Los Angeles, overlooking the Pacific.

Farewell

The closing general session of the
Congress was held on Friday morning,
and the luggage of most delegates was
packed by noon, before the Disneyland
trip. Sandwiched between rather hectic
activities, farewells were exchanged
with old and new friends in the recre-
ation field, and—suddenly—the fast
five (or six) days were over! Delegates,
armed with summaries of the meetings,
printed materials and pencilled notes,
departed, to settle down in planes, trains,
boats and cars, to sort out impressions,
new ideas, inspiration, know-how, and
memories—grist for that all-important
local report and future planning! 75‘!

ftlrninistrative Problems of Executives.
An engrossing session was held by the
executives, who divided attendance into
ten sub-groups, each with a previously
appointed chairman. For example, a
group led by Walter Cammack, super-
intendent of recreation in Whittier,
California, discussed the importance of
the annual report among the various
media utilized by a recreation depart-
ment‘. Members decided that it ranks
high because its purpose is to give the
public an account of stewardship. They
recommended that it contain: (1) prog-
ress of programs or plans (factual sta-
tistics); (2) information about per-
sonnel—fulI-time and part-time; (3)
report re present facilities; (4-) capital
improvements; (4-) finances—increase
of previous years, financial needs, anal-
ysis of sources, factual figures of ex-
penditures; (6) co-sponsorship, des-
criptive material, acknowledgement to
co-sponsoring organizations; (7) plans
for future expansion (very important) ;
and (8) achievements.

On the other hand, Martha Maitre,
superintendent of recreation in Mobile,
Alabama, chaired a sub-group discus-
sion on whether teen-agers should be
used more extensively as recreation
leaders. Mrs. Maitre’s group felt, gen-
erally, that teen-agers can make good
leaders, and that their employment is
one of the best recruiting devices a rec-
reation executive can support. (This
was considered a very important point.)
The youngsters should, however, _be as-
sistants to trained, adult leaders. A
teen-ager has limitations and should
not ever be hired to the exclusion of a
qualified adult.

These two t0pics merely indicate the
wide range of subjects at the session.

Industry Plans for Its Retiring Employ-
ees. A favorable trend, brought out in
this session, is that, with early retire-
ment and more leisure, industries are
now paying more attention to preparing
employees for this adjustment, many of
the companies starting as early as five
years in advance. Some are employing
retirement administrators or counselors.

It was agreed that retiring persons

should be encouraged, among other
things, to join community recreation ac-
tivities and to familiarize themselves

354

 

with all of the possibilities of their own
neighborhood or town.

Recreation’s Role with Youth in Can-
flict. This session was chaired by Philip
C. Green, director of the Division of
Juvenile Delinquency Service, U. S'. De-
partment -of Health, Education and

Welfare. Panel members were Sidney
Dwoskin 0f the probation department

of Los Angeles County and Sidney G.
Lutzin, director of community organi-
zation of the New York State Youth
Commission. The role of recreation in
juvenile delinquency prevention, con-
trol ‘and treatment was discussed in the
light of current facts: Children’s Bureau
Juvenile Court

1956. The FBI recently reported a sev-
enteen per cent increase in juvenile ar-
rests in 1956 over 1955—over forty per

cent of these wcre children under fifteen

statistics indicate a

years of age. Professional organizations
and agencies are taking a new look at
their total service to children, youth and
their families. The American public has
accepted the premise that recreation is
a delinquency preventative, although
recreation leaders have not devclopcrl
programs for this purpose. The recrea-
tion field therefore stands accused of
failure because it has not stemmed the
delinquency tide.

It was pointcd out that we must begin
to make this important by-product of
delinquency prevention an important
facet of our programs or we run thc
risk of losing community support for
the total program servicing the larger
percentage of population. We must rec-
ognize that recreation programs which
can serve the nceds of youth in conflict
must be concerned with the develop-

Recreation departments, whether co-

should seriously consider sending ouI
workers detached from a “facility” and
able to work with youngsters where-
ever they are——perhaps eventually draw-

the initial rejection of a group, or ever
continued hostility, without becoming
defensive. This is part of the “testing’
process by which group members de‘

When a relationship has been de‘

programs are continued only because
they have been in existence for years;
administrative body of the church often
relegates its recreation life to a minor
role; and need to remind leaders of the

Often objection to church recreation
stems from the feeling that the program

How’m l Doin’—-Tlte Importance of
Self-Evaluation. Chaired by Howard
Jeffrey, the American Recreation Soci-
ety’s new executive director, this ses-
sion discussed three questions:

1. What is self-evaluation? Observ-
ing one’s self is self-evaluation. As a
preliminary to observing one’s self it is
important to know human behavior and
the dynamics of cause and effect as they
relate to leisure. It is important to
know your community, the people, eco-
nomics, culture, and how to relate psy-
chology and sociology to your work.

2. Thc purpose of self-evaluation.
This is to help people to understand
themselves and to grow. It is a two-
way role. You must evaluate yourself
as a supervisor and as a supervisee. It
should be done with respect to the goals
of the employing organization.

3. What is done with self-evaluation
results? A study is made of the results
and a decision reached as to how to
improve for growth.

It is important to share evaluation
concepts of individuals with one an-
other, keeping aware of the need to be
constructive in discussion and that com-
munication can easily break down. Self-
evaluation tests are important for every
staff member, regularly, and this pro-
cedure can be applied to part-time staff
with success—THOMAS BELTON, Super-

State Legislation and Special Appropri-
ations and Projects. Sterling S. Winans,
director of recreation in Sacramento,
California, chaired this meeting. Before
the session, panel members had can-
vassed an assigned list of states for in-
formation regarding 1957 legislation,
whether passed or defeated, relating to
public recreation and park services
(state government, city, county or park
district). About forty states replied,
but indicated a need for some agency to
compile digests of legislation, as Cali-
fornia, Colorado, and Washington have

done. Almost every state had bills per-
taining to recreation. Defeat of some
measures was as significant as passage
of others. States with official recreation
agencies had more bills. Washington
in 1947 had only three, in 1957 fifty-
six, thirteen of which passed. California
had two hundred bills, not counting
those dealing with conservation.

Every state has some agency to ac-
quire and administer state parks, histor-
ical monuments. The process of ac-
quiring and developing lands for state
park and recreation purposes involves
such factors as: reluctance to take lands
by condemnation; development of way-
side rests with picnic facilities; regula-
tion of boating with measures for safety,
sanitary controls, registrations; and es-
tablishment of state park and recreation
boards. A considerable number of
states are considering measures to es-
tablish a state agency for development
of local recreation and park services.
In California a “Public Outdoor Rec-
reation Plan” is to be developed by a

committee of the executive officers of
eight state departments and agencies

for recommendation to the legislature.

A digest of legislation reported from
all states will be prepared, and copies

will be available on request from Mr.

Clinic for Publication Editors. This,

the first meeting of its kind at a Con-
gress, may prove to be the forerunner

of others. It was chaired by Dorothy
Donaldson, editor of RECREATION. Only

a few of the many‘items of concern to
the group could be discussed. Among
them were: that alert recreation admin-
istrators and staff personnel must be
aware of the tremendous importance of
professional publications as a tool for
stimulating interest and providing es-
sential information in the recreation
field on local, state or national level;
the importance of establishing the pur-
pose of a publication.

The purposes and objectives of de-
partmental publications should include
the providing of vital information re-
garding local city-wide events and ac-
tivities, new program ideas and public
relations values.

Design: All should have an especially
designed masthead, and complete iden-
tification in a prominent place. Careful
use of “white space” and an interesting
presentation without too much solid
copy are important.

Advertising: Many basic elements
govern the principles of advertising in
material published at the state level,
such as the following: (1) potential in-
cludes regional and state firms or local
firms serving several communities;
(2) do not overlook contributing or
gift advertising from industry, insur-
ance companies or individuals; (3)
don’t go into the advertising business
blindly—determine publication costs;
extent of advertising should support the
publication, and the circulation; (4)
establish basic size ads and establish the
price on a year’s contract commitment
and a higher rate for a single issue;
(5) establish a committee, if desirable,
under a business manager.

An information and rate sheet should
be printed, for proper clarification, for
prospective advertisers. 0f pertinent
importance is the need to clarify the ex-
tent to which the publication is read,
establish proof-of-readership. —- TEM-

School for Skiing

Go to ski school on a snowy slope, ae-
quire a winter tan, learn to take part in

the many aspects of this exciting out-
door sport! When you report to your
instructor, have your equipment ship-
shape and ready to go. Don’t start les-
sons with skis on the wrong feet, bind-
ings loose, no mittens, and so on. If
you do, you’ll soon hear about it!

Ski schools for local young people
are starting in the northern parts of
the country, from coast to coast, and
will be well under way by the end of

December. On Washington’s Mount
Rainier, a weekend school, held in Janu-
ary and February for young Taeomans,
is sponsored by the Metropolitan Park
Board and the Tacoma News Tribune.
Transportation is provided.

In Vermont and New Hampshire, ski-
ing is so popular that citizens feel it un-
fair that any child should grow up with-
out instruction. Therefore, the Ford
Sayre Ski Council was founded, with
funds to be used for ski instruction
for any school child from the first
through the eighth grade in Hanover

Skis are rented for one dollar per sea-

essential, and the techniques used with

Jumping, on the other hand, is the
thing in Lebanon, New Hampshire.’ A
local lad, at the age of sixteen, became
the first American born jumper to win
a Class A rating in the sport. Since then,
the town has developed several Olympic
contenders. Thus the whole state has
become enthusiastic, and a group of
business men provide facilities and in-
struction after school and on weekends.
Youngsters pile into the school bus for
the haul to the ski area, a few miles from
town, and learn to jump as soon as they
learn to ski.

Life-guards. Swimming guards were
given special ice-skating instruction
on rescue and safety, and were on duty
from 4 PM. to 10 PM. on weekdays and

from 10 AM. to 10 P.M. on Saturdays
and Sundays.

In addition, an ice-skating safety
demonstration was conducted by the
recreation department, with the cooper-
ation of the rescue squad and the police
department. The high school physical
education classes served as demonstrat-
ors. It included demonstrations of the
use of ordinary clothing and other
easily found materials in making a res-
cue. Items used were scarves, sweaters,
belts, jackets, and so on; a plank or a
long pole; lifebuoys with a long rope
(at least one hundred feet in length) ;
a rope with looped ends; a ladder; and
a tree branch.

Various methods of self-rescue were
covered, such as the hip-climp-out- and
roll method; the use of mittens sticking
to the ice; what to do if you find your-
self under water; what to do if it is
necessary to keep breaking the ice to
reach the shore line, when you have

Don’t Forget Snow Sculpture

Students at Dartmouth College began
to model in snow in 1920, and have been
at it ever since. Their snow sculpturing
has achieved world renown, and their
know-how should be "‘of great value to
anyone interested in this activity. A
detailed account of their techniques
was published in the November 1953
issue of RECREATION,** “The Art of
Snow Sculpture.” J. Band of the Dart-
mouth Outing Club, in writing us re-
cently, again emphasizes the best eHects
are not achieved with'the use of colored
snow. “Snow is snow, is snow”—— with

Of course, if your sliding hills serve

The playground is smack in the cen-

by residential streets. Each street has
a full complement of kids! There is a
small hill at one side, so small that it is
of interest only to the six-year-old set.
But what about those twelve-year-olds?
The answer is a special snow slide.

What is the Point of Sport?

Arnold Kaecll

Why should we look for a justification for sport? Why
insist on making it utilitarian and give it an end outside
itself? Because, doubtless, we live in a time that claims “that
every undertaking must be useful, and every man must let
himself be used”; and because we can neither imagine nor
accept the idea of sport as self-sufficient, owning no particu-
lar aim, and finding its true sense and justification pre-
cisely in its detachment fromimaterial things.

We can be glad that sport is good for health; that sport
can mold character; and that, through sport, this or that in-
dividual has formed lasting bonds of friendship in defiance
of frontiers and oceans. Even if there were no more to it
than joy in the rhythm of the runner’s gait, the jumper’s
illusion of freedom from earthly ties, the helter-skelter down
the ski-slopes, the sudden cool of a dive, or the passionate,
total absorption in a contest—if sport were nothing but aim-
less, useless play—we should still have no choice but to
defend it.

While we are engaged in sport we move in the blessed
realm of childhood; while we are engaged in sport the
dreams of youth are still alive within us. We give freely of
ourselves because we ask nothing in return; we are disinter-

ested because we do not ask if our acts are useful. When
we engage in sport wc are at play and it is only at play that
man is truly man. as Schiller has told us.

To many this play secms an activity of the body merely.
Thcy see the body in movement, the vigor of a stroke, the
swing of the gymnast’s arms and legs, but they do not see
what goes on inside. They do not see all. It is as if a man
should look at a picturc and see nothing but lines and colors,
or at a statuc and think only of the material of which it is
madc, or read a scorc and never hear thc music. Thc body,
and the feats it performs, are ends to thcm; whereas in true
sport the performance is not an end in itsclf—nor the body
either—~but the means of expression. Moving over the
ground, thrusting throngh the wave, gliding ovcr the snowy
slopcs, or wrestling with the rock face—thesc are expres-
sions of the joy of life itself, expressions of thc well-being
won from living close to nature. The body is but the means
of expression, the instrumcnt the soul rcquires to enable it
to measure the territory which has bccn granted to man.
and occupy it to the limit.

Only thus can we explain why “they which run in a race,
run _all, but one reccivcth the prize,” only thus understand
how records can go on forever being broken. . . . Sport is
the faithful imagc of the struggle of humanity towards pcr-
fcction; in sport soul and body togethcr strivc to accomplish
the age-old aspiration of mankind—“fastcr, hardcr, higher.”

There lies “the point” of sport, its whole importancc, itsl
truc meaning. lt necds no othcr justification. if ‘

A collection of not-so-well-known be-
liefs and ceremonies. Tell the stories
in your story hour or adapt some
of the ideas new to your program.

it Denmark—There is one custom in Denmark that is almost
entirely unique to that country: “Blowing in the Yule.” At
sunrise, while the people are at breakfast, the town band
climbs the many steep ladders to the top of the church tower

and plays four old hymns, one to each corner of the compass,
so that no one is forgotten. Those sitting in their homes al-
ways join in with the song as soon as they hear the first note.
As the fourth hymn ends, the deep voices of the big church

bells commence to boom and Yule is under way.

*Norway—In Norway they have a legend that on every
Christmas Eve the little Christ Child wanders all over the
world bearing on His shoulders a bundle of evergreens.
Those who would invite Him into their homes set a lighted
candle in the window to guide Him on his way. They be-
lieve He comes in the disguise of any wandering person who
knocks humbly at their door for sustenance, thus testing
their goodness. So they show hospitality to all visitors, be-
lieving that such aid is done as unto the Christ Child.

it Sweden—Here, the people prepare for the Christmas fes-
tival by a thorough housecleaning, in which everything in-
doors and out is made spotless. At all times in the year they
believe that “cleanliness is next to Godliness” and so, in
honor of this day, they prepare to celebrate it in a Godly
house. Wheat for the birds is placed on a pole in front of
each house. The horses, cows, cats and dogs are not for-
gotten, but are given an extra portion of the best for their
supper because, when. the Christ Child was born, His cradle

was in a manger.

$1? Germany—Every home in Germany has a Christmas tree,
and it is from the Germans that other countries have learned
to use it. “Knecht Rupert” delivers toys to the deserving
and a rod to the naughty from a branch which he carries.

.' I DECEMBER 1957

if? France—Iii’France at Christmas time it is the rule of the
family gatherings that all the quarrels of the year shall be
forgiven and forgotten before the family have their cele-
bration. While the feast is in progress, the older people
usually tell stories of the doings of those who, in the past,
have brought honor upon the family naine. After the supper
is over, noels are sung. .

On December 4, the Feast of St. Barbara, the women
plant St. Barbara’s grain. On Christmas day the plants are
placed in a bowl on the table when the great supper is

served, the growing sprouts being a symbol of the harvest
of the New Year that is soon beginning.

31‘? H olland—Christmas Day is celebrated by the Hollanders
with church rites and pleasant family visiting. St. Nich-

olas comes on December fifth. He tells the children whether
he thinks they have been good or bad during the year. He
then wishes them all a Happy New Year and scatters a

great shower of candies on a linen sheet spread out by the
door. After St. Nick leaves each child removes one of his

clean wooden shoes, places it on the window sill, arid fills it
with oats and hay or carrots for the good Saint’s horse.
In the morning the oats, hay and carrots are gone and the
shoes are found filled with gifts and candy.

*England—They play games, sing carols, feast on pud-
dings and mince pies in this country, but probably the old-
est custom, and one which we usually associate with them,
is the bringing in of the yule log. This is an emblem of the
true light that‘dawned on the world at the birth of Christ.
A yule candle sheds light on the festivities during the

evening.

3’»? I reland—Christmas Eve is the only time in the year when
Mass is said at night. It is observed in Roman Catholic
countries at midnight, because it is commonly believed that
Christ was born at about that hour. In Ireland, each family
leaves for the village church at about eleven o’clock. The
father leads the way with a lantern or torch. As the differ-
ent families come together they unite in singing carols.
Bells are also rung to announce the Nativity of Christ.

if Italy—~In Italy, instead of having a Christmas tree, a large
urn is used. It is filled with small gifts and an occasional
dummy package. When the children and adults draw from
this much fun results especially when the empty package
is drawn. Carol singing, the making of the Christmas man-
ger and the giving of Christmas plays are also popular.

ifrAmerica—Most of the ChriStmas customs in America
have come from Europe: our Christmas tree from Germany;
our Santa Claus from Holland; our Christmas stockings
from Belgium or France; Merry Christmas from England,
and also our Christmas cards, plum puddings and mince
pies. The one thing that is strictly native to this country is
the use of the poinsettia.

NRA Expansion

 

Langkammer

Tapplivr

As part of the expansion of the Na-
tional Recreation Association services,
two new district representatives are now
in action in the field. Richard “Wink”
Tapply, who has been a special Associa-
tion representative in New Hampshire
under special funds for that purpose,
will become a regular member of the
NRA field staff as of January 1, 1958.

In addition, David M. Langkammer,
superintendent of recreation in Altoona,
Pennsylvania, since 1948, has been ap-
pointed third full-time NRA district
representative for the Great Lakes Dis-
trict. Dave, as he was known to every-
one in Altoona, did an outstanding job
in that city; and a recent, very fine edi-
torial in the Altoona Mirror attests to
his accomplishments and p0pularity in
that community. It says, in part, “He
leaves behind a memory of success, one
of development. . . . He helped put this
city on the map in recreation and in
community enterprises.”

NRA Citations

At the annual National Recreation
Congress Banquet, Joe E. Brown, pro-
fessional comedian, member of the

Swimming Pool Awards

A series of annual competitions in
the swimming pool field has been ini-
tiated by Swimming Pool Age maga-
zine, endorsed by the National Swim-
ming Pool Institute. George Butler, di-
rector of the NRA Research Depart-
ment, will serve on the award panel in
the public relations field. The award
will go to the community, organization,
group or individual who has done the
best public relations job for their
pool(s) to increase attendance, build
community good will and increase, in
the eye of the community, the import-

ance of the pool to community life and
the value of swimming.

Milestone

The California Recreation Commis-
sion celebrated its tenth anniversary in
October. Over 150 state leaders from
the legislature, the California Depart-
ment of Natural Resources, Division of
Water Resources, Department of Fish
and Wildlife, Division of Park and
Beaches, Department of Education, pri-
vate agencies and public recreation and
park departments of the state gathered
to mark the occasion. An all-day pro-
gram was arranged with remarks from
key leaders in the recreation movement
in California. The program was cul-
minated by a banquet with the closing
address given by Mrs. Rollin Brown,
chairman of the commission and NRA
board member, on the subject “Cali-
fornia Looks Ahead."

The National Recreation Association
Board of Directors, through its district
representative, John J. Collier, prescnt-

ed a Special National Citation for the

outstanding contribution made to the
recreation movement by the California
Recreation Commission, its director”;

Sterling S. Winans, and his staff. \

Young Folks in Homes

sion, a large portion of Young Folks in
Homes, written by Jeanne Barnes for
the NRA. These bulletins were so help-
ful to child care institutions that they
have now been printed in an attractive
spiralbound booklet through funds
made available by the Federal Child
Welfare Services Fund. Leaders in
child-care institutions may obtain a

Uprooting Prejudice

The Workshop for Cultural Democ-
racy, an educational service organiza-
tion in the field of human relations, has
been developing techniques, materials,
and the kinds of emotionally satisfying
face-to-face experiences which help to
get at the roots of social prejudices.
Most significant among the techniques
developed by the workshOp, under the
leadership of Dr. Rachel Davis DuBois,
is group conversation. Under the guid-
ance of a skilled leader, participants of
a session share meaningful memories.
Wit, humor, songs, and, often, remarks
of deep significance come spontaneous-
ly; and a feeling of belonging together
comes over the group. The resultant
acceptance of self as well as of others
has been found to be healthful and helps
to produce a feeling of community.

The workshOp has trained hundreds

of professional and lay leaders and has
conducted projects in intercultural edu-
cation in numerous educational, social
and religious agencies. A manual for
leaders, Know Your Neighbors, may be
secured for $1.25 at the workshop’s
headquarters, 204 East 18th Street, New
York 3.

Tools of Learning

The Association for Childhood Edu-

cation International has just published
a revised copy of Equipment and Sup-
plies (General Service Bulletin N o. 39),
listing “tools of learning” that have
been tested and approved for pre-school,
school and home——and for the recrea-
tion program as well. The listing is so
organized that equipment and supplies
for any special type of program can be
found quickly; for example, a complete
listing of all the different supplies and
equipment for an intermediate group
of thirty youngsters. Should you need
to find out what types of climbing struc-
tures are available, the manufacturers
and the age-level of use, a separate
listing makes them simple to locate.
Listings for arts and craft supplies, mus-
ical instruments, records and furniture
are an excellent resource. The bulletin

is available for $1.25 from the associa-

tion at 1200 Fifteenth Street, N.W.,
Washington 5, D. C.

Recreation for Handicapped

Interesting work is being done in
California in recreation for the handi-
capped. Janet Pomeroy, founder and
director of the Recreation Center for
the Handicapped, Inc., San Francisco:
is spearheading a movement to acquaint
public recreation departments with their
opportunities and responsibilities to
these people—and some of the results
that can be obtained with them, by
using recreation leadership techniques
as against the “therapy” approach. “In
therapy, children perform activities up-
on prescription,” says Mrs. Pomeroy,
“and there is no free choice. It is al-

most like taking medicine to get bet-
ter.

“On the other hand, recreation is
participated in ‘for fun,’ and in the
process, the children become so absorb-
ed that they forget about their infirmi-
ties. I have seen them drop and forget

their crutches. Our results have been

amazing.”

A seven-day institute on “Recreation
for the Physically Handicapped,” held
for California recreation leaders under
the auspices of the Recreation Center
for the Handicapped, the Adult Educa-
tion Division of the San Francisco
School District, the San Francisco Rec-
reation Department, and the California
Recreation Commission last March, was
well attended. It included actual work
with the handicapped members of the
center, to stimulate the interest and add
to the “know-how” of recreation work-
ers, in this field. As a result of this in-
stitute, a number of recreation depart-
ments in that area have since set up
new and flourishing programs for the
handicapped.

this meeting are still available from

hacker Pool Building, Great Highway

“Grass. Roots”

Recreation

Charles H. Odegaard

“This county recreation plan appears to be

suitable for use by other states and counties.”
——C. E. Reed, NRA Field Department

T 0 THE WEST of the growing city of Milwaukee lies even

faster-growing Waukesha County. In 1950, this
county had 86,000 people engaged in business, industry and
farming over its 576 square miles of rolling green inter-
spersed with placid lakes. Then the rush started. Six short
years later small communities had mushroomed where corn-

fields once had been; cities with increased commerce and in-
dustrial developments had displaced the smaller villages.

A conservative estimate placed the population at 110,000,
or an increase of twenty-eight per cent. This made Wau-
kesha the fastest growing county in Wisconsin.

This population growth, which shows every indication
of increasing even more rapidly, is gathered into sixteen
townships, sixteen villages and three cities, the largest
having only 25,000 inhabitants. To add further to the
widespread clusters of population, there are ninety sepa-
rate public school districts outside of the three cities, plus
thirteen parochial schools.

To all of which you might say—so what? It is easy to
see where this affects taxes, transportation, zoning and the
like, but what effect does it have on recreation? Basically,

two things: first, with the exception of two cities and one ,

township, no municipal area has over five thousand popu-
lation, the average being around two thousand; second.
a great majoiity of this increased growth is the result of
migration from cities where there are existing recreation
programs and where a recreation director does the planning.

Put these two points together (small communities and
people who desire recreation‘opportunities but have al-
ways had them planned for them) and you have a real
problem. Many of these communities are not even large
enough for a full-time summer program, to say nothing
of a year-round program. Nevertheless, these people want
a year-round program just the same, and this is where the
problem arises.

To further add to this, we find that the county has over

ence had advance registration of 225. Charles

one hundred and fifteen churches, the majority of which
are extremely interested in recreation programs within
their churches. The rabbis, priests and ministers are won-
derful people, trained in their particular religion but not
to any degree in recreation. They, too, need help in operat-
ing a program.

One hundred and twenty industries, most of which are
too small to hire a recreation director but large enough
to need in-plant programs, are also searching for the way
to conduct activities for the benefit of their employees and
their families. So the need grows,_but what to do about it?

Many people decided that something should be done
about it. The research, study and legwork done by these
individuals and agencies is too great to go into here. How-
ever, their success was evident when, early in 1956. the
county board of supervisors authorized and directed the
agriculture committee to hire a county recreation agent
whose “sole duty shall be to coordinate recreation in Wau-
kesha County and to provide leadership training."

This broad statement has provided the latitude for doing
a great deal of work with the various county organizations.
Basically the role of the county recreation agent and that

of the National Recreation Association field representative
are very similar.

Information and Training Servicps
Resource. Schools and part-time recreation departments
ask for information on how to lay out a playground or
ahout the selection of equipment. We try to aid them in
the choice of materials and in locating sources. Or an
individual might seek information about camp sites—the
only limit to the questions is the limit of the ever-searching
mind.

Consultation. All types of agencies and groups have pre-.
scntcd us with their specific problems to be solved. Nat-
urally, we don’t have all the answers; but by talking with
these peeple and using educational techniques we are often
able to help them find solutions.

WorkshOps. By studying the various types of problems and
requests that are presented, we are able to determine some
of the needs. Based upon these needs, a works110p is held

lit-:CREtTlON

in an effort to reach many of these people at one time. It
might be through a skills workshop with instruction in a
specific area of interest, such as arts and crafts, or it may
be a techniques workslmp where leaders learn how best to
instruct their group or class.

Miscellaneous. Through meetings, radio talks, newspaper
articles and features, and TV appearances, our office is
continually broadcasting the message of recreation—the
need for it as a part of the process‘of living and the proper
standards necessary for evaluating leisure-time practices.

Though thc results are intangible, it is felt that this ap-
proach has been very effective.

.—

Coordination

As is to be expected, the coordination phase of the Wau-
I kesha County program is taking longer to put into prac-
tice. It will develop only as the various groups and activi-
ties are started in different areas. Some examples of how
this coordination might take place are:

Through Athletics: Setting up county-wide leagues when
the various municipalities develop baseball teams. These
leagues to be financed and operated completely by the
teams, with our aid in scheduling, promoting and general
administration.

Through Programing: Grouping together of four or five
neighboring communities so they can more efficiently and
economically operate their summer programs.

Through Other Activities: Holding cooperative training
institutes and jointly scheduling activities by way of pro-
gram planning.

In the brief year of the existence of the county agent’s
office, direct services have been given to officers and/ or
leaders in recreation departments, schools, PTA’s, Boy and
Girl Scouts, 4-H, churches, service clubs, industries, YMCA,
adult groups and other special interest groups.

As you can see, our program is not an activities pro-
gram, but, as is true with all extension work, a service pro-
gram. We have no money to operate activities per se but
only staff pcrsonnel to aid others in helping themselves.
We firmly believe that these communities and the people
therein will not only be better citizens by participating in
recreation but even the more so by planning and adminis-
tering it themselves.

This is not the easiest type of recreation program to
conduct. In my last job, as director of parks and recre-
ation in another Wisconsin community, I thought that
there was no limit to the scope of such a program. I still
feel that there is no limit; however, I believe, now, that it
is more difficult to stimulate others to desire the proper
program and then to train their leaders to operate it, but
it is also very satisfying and wider in scope. We all re-
alize, I am sure, that there is a place and a need for both
types of program—activity and service.

Many people would not like this type of a job because
rarely do you come in direct contact with program partici-
pants. However, this is more than compensated for by the

DECEMBER 1957

tremendous number of leaders with whom you come in con-
tact every week. In a sense, these people become your par-
ticipants, as they too are learning the tools of leisure time
—-only from a different view.

We have found that, though each agency or organization
has a philosophy of its own and a training program pecul-
iar to itself, there are also many ideas common to all. As
an example of "this, our office operated a one-day recre-
ation conference with six speakers covering the following
subjects: “Recreation—A Basic Essential Today,” “What
It Is and Where Found,” “Aids and Resources for Recre-
ation Development,“ “Recreation is Big Business,” “Special
Needs in Recreation,” “Puhlic Relations.” Area workshops
were held in the afternoon. More than two hundred and
fifty people participated in this conference—and are clam-
oring for more. All but about ten of these participants were
non-professionals.

As is to be expected, no program with such new ideas
of operation can be successful without excellent assistance
from many areas. There is, of course,’ the invaluable con-
sultation and advice given by the extension staff and the
agriculture committee in Waukesha County and the exten-
sion staff of the state university. These are available to
all agents. In addition to these wonderful people, there
are two special groups which need further explaining.

At the start of this program we carefully selected cer-
tain topflight qualified people who serve as a consultant
committee on recreation for our department. These men
represent certain local branches of government plus the
state university, state government and the National Rec-
reation Association; and they have done wonders in aid-
ing with nearly all program planning. Their keen minds
have saved many an error, as they have perceived the prob-
lems which would arise and have pre-planned optional
roads of travel.

And then there is the Citizens Recreation Council which,
naturally, is county-wide in membership, with all activity
areas being represented. The council as a unit is divided
into sub-committees concerned directly with the develop-
ment and promotion of such areas of interest as arts and
crafts, music, outdoor recreation, and the others with which
we are so familiar. These people are not only close to the
citizens; they are the citizens. At this time, none of us
are truly able to view the scope of what this council might
do. Our office shall aid it in any way possible for it is
truly the vehicle by which citizens plan their own recrea-
tion destiny.

Here, then, is a brief glimpse of a new avenue in recre-
ation——an avenue that drives right into the problems ex-
emplified in grass roots, an avenue that has tributaries yet
untraveled but which someday will be well worn.

Naturally, only time will give validity and stability to
such a program. However, if the amount and variety of
services already requested and rendered are indicative of
its need, it looks as though this is potentially a new era in
recreation! 79?

The place of the recreation

worker in the hospital set-up.

Joseph B. Wolfie, M.D.

T THE VERY OUTSET, let us dispel any notion concerning

lines of demarcation between preventive and thera-

peutic medicine, recreation and the humanities. They are
interdependent.

W e hear it often said, even by recreators: “If only we
had enough scientific proof, our profession would make

tremendous strides!” Let us take a moment to. analyze that.
All of us are strong for the accumulation of scientific data,
on any subject. Science is a discipline—a discipline of
thinking, of planning, of deduction. Therefore, the results
must come as disciplined conclusions.

To what extent, however, is the practice of medicine
scientific? Preventive medicine against infectious and con-
tagious diseases, the use of antibiotics in therapy— these
are definitely based on scientific observations. The same
prospects will hold true for recreation, as we go along.

At this stage, when recreation is serving more and more
as an important, universally applicable modality, let us not
make a fetish out of science, and shun empiricism.

The history of mankind from its earliest beginnings,
starting with the narrative of the Old Testament, if you
will, is replete with examples of practical appreciation of
methodologies aimed at health and fitness. There are the
stringent sanitation regulations laid down by Moses for the
ancient Hebrews.

True, recreation indulgences such as the rhythmic dance
were connected with emotional eXpressions of religious fer-
vor. Cleanliness of body was equated with purity of mind,
heart and soul.

Yet, how did the teachers and leaders of those ancient
people know these activities were beneficial? Surely not
through scientific investigation! Their knowledge and in-
sights were empirical. What they, and those who followed
them in succeeding generations, distilled from observation
and experience came later to be confirmed by evolving
scientific wisdom.

Prior to the turn of the century, the great cellular patholo-
gist, Rudolph Virchow, crystallized, in his own career, the
responsibility of medical science in the realm of the humani-

ties. The founder of cellular pathology, he contributed to
virtually every branch of medicine.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing but
medicine on a large scale,” Virchow declared. What the good
doctor was trying to tell us is that statesmen have the same
responsibility to the welfare of humanity that medical sci-
ence has, in its own sphere.

That medicine, again, is a social science, is evidenced in
the fact that, when his defenses are down, the average physi-
cian will admit that he practices, largely, empirical medicine
——-based on what he has observed, often contrary to what
would be indicated by laboratory findings.

In the past decade, after examining thousands of athletes
and subjecting patients in our hospital to recreation activi-
ties, we learned what we should have known long ago:
Abnormalities found on physical examination, X-ray, in
clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and through
other precision instruments—all of these must be inter-
preted in terms of the individual, particularly in relation to
his capacity for performance.

The implication is clear—and for me, sound and true. If
we reason honestly and competently from exPerience, we are
utilizing the best of know-how for the benefit of those we
seek to help, whether medically or educationally.

In the area of education and health, where recreation is
coming to be recognized more and more as a vital modality
in both preventive medicine and therapeutics, the non-MD—
you, the recreator—has an historic role to play.

The competent recreator is in a uniquely important posi-
tion to observe many things which the practicing physician
never gets to see. Such observations are very valuable and
need to be called to the attention of the medical profession
at large. The physician, the hospital, the private and public
health agency all need the recreator as a key member in the
multi-disciplined team.

The recreator in a hospital setting is in a strategic position
to observe that a certain typc of music tranquilizes the agi-
tated, While music of another kind counteracts depression.
He or she may note that on a night following a certain type
of movie, fewer patients will require restraint; that dancing
diminishes hostility; that a successfully played game pro-
duces niore self-confidence than any drug as yet available
on the market. It becomes the job of that recreator to record
such observations and disseminate the information where it
can be utilized to greatest therapeutic advantage.

The time must come soon when the non-MD, who is
trained, by academics and, more especially, by experience,
in fields vital to the realization of medicine’s own true aims,
should be liberated from the fear of overstepping profes-
sional bounds. They are professionals. Aware of their limi-
tations, the men and women skilled in the arts of recreation

are capable of making clinical observations that are on a
par with those produced by the best of physicians.

There is an area of diagnostic acumen and treatment
know-how which, under the supervision of medical author-
ity, can make the recreation therapist an invaluable member
of the broad team involving the cardiologist, the neuropsy-
chiatrist, the surgeon, and other specialists. At the same
time, the various Specialists in medicine must learn from
the recreator about the available modalities and their physi-
ologic and therapeutic effects. Our knowledge in this field
calls for a close and free exchange of experiences.

I now report to you on the application of a recreation
therapy program under good leadership in one of our hos-
pitals, as against another under our direction in which no
recreation therapy was employed.

In the institution with the recreation program, uneXpect-
edly rapid improvement was seen among those patients in
whom the overlay of tensions, anxieties, organ fixations and
repressions were prevalent. This observation convinced us
that in many of these instances the somatic disease from
which the patients were supposedly suffering accounted only
in part for their symptoms.

The lack of ability to perform daily tasks without undue
fatigue was found to be the result of an overcautious atti-
tude on the part of medical authorities toward needed physi-
cal exertion.

A distinct relationship seemed to exist among our patients
between the degree of functional disturbance and restriction
of physical activities. Limited mobility of joints, muscular
aches and pains, and a tendency to hopelessness were out-
standing symptoms which could not be accounted for by
organic disease even when present. With the diminution of
the individual’s total fitness, a greater degree of anxiety
and organ fixation became very apparent. This vicious cycle
results from the lack of appreciation that activities, recrea-
tional as well as others, are as essential as food and oxygen.

Prerequisites for a Department

of Recreation Therapy

1. Outdoor recreation activities are preferred if the hos-
pilal’s physical setup is suitable. Even in crowded city
quarters a splendid job can be done. An air-conditioned,
clean, indoor, recreation room can be superior to a dusty.

windy, and noisy outdoors.

2. Personnel must become thoroughly familiar with each
patient’s functional capacity. The recreation therapist must

understand the diagnosis and prognosis in every case” in
order to be able to recognize the symptoms of progression
and retrogression of the malady.

3. Graded walks are of great value.

DECEMBER 1957

4-. Space for playing medicine ball, croquet, quoits, horse—
shoe, dancing, and other activities should be provided.

5. Indoor facilities should be available for inclement
weather and for those patients not well enough to partake
in outdoor activities. Since indoor activities must be pro-
vided at least one-third of the year because of climatic
conditions, the facilities must be adequate.

6. Proper time allotment for recreation should be made
in the hospital schedule.

7. Nursing, medical and technical staffs from other de-
partments should come to understand that the recreation

department is as important to the individual in need of it .
as any other therapeutic procedure.

8. Periodic re-evaluation of the patient’s clinical progress

is essential and should be done jointly by the medical and
recreation staff.

9. If the patient fails to Show improvement, a re-evalua-
tion of the methods employed is imperative. This should
be done in the same manner as review of drug therapy in
patients who fail to show the expected progress.

10. The head of such a department should be a member

of the major staff and report the patient’s progress at regu-
lar staff conferences.

Remuneration for Recreation Services

It is quite apparent that it will take time until everybody
concerned comes to realize that recreation activities are an
effective form of therapeutics and prophylaxis. Many pa-
tients do not yet understand the medical value of properly

supervised recreation activities. Needless to say, a patient
with this type of attitude is not willing to pay for such services.

The various hospital insurance plans such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield are also unaware of the fact that an effec-
tive recreation program is not only humane but also eco-
nomically sound. It diminishes the number of days spent
in a hospital, reduces the need for expensive drugs, and pre-
vents frequent re-hospitalization. The moneys thus saved
would not only cover the expense of an outstanding recrea-
tion department, but would also mean a saving in man-
power. In addition, an important facet would be added to
preventive medicine, and invalidism would be reduced.

If moneys were available to compensate adequately for

recreation therapy, all hospitals would be able to provide
their patients with this needed advantage. Recreation per-

sonnel would be afforded the recognition they deserve, and
this, in turn, would assure growth of the profession.

Recreation, properly employed as an auxiliary thera-
peutic measure, will yet prove to be equally as important
as any of the so-called “miracle” drugs.

More importantly, “re-created” patients, helped by a
skilled team of therapists who respect and care for each

of them as a complete person, will symbolize the interre-
lated values of recreation, medicine and the humanities. ‘L

Christmas Tour for Golden-Agers

Robert A. Lee, superintendent of recreation in Iowa City,
Iowa, tells of a program his department and the local Ki-
wanis Club inaugurated four years ago—a program which
gives the senior citizens of the area a chance to see their
city’s holiday trim in comfort and sociability.

The recreation department and thc Kiwanis Club plan a
motor caravan for the local Golden-Age Club to take place
several days before Christmas. The program is organized
in the following manner: The recreation department com-
piles a list of the various homes that have been entered in
the annual Christmas decoration and lighting contest; a
route is planned to include as many of these decorated
homes and areas as possible; and the names and addresses of
those Golden-Age Club members who want to make the tour

are obtained. Then the Kiwanis Club takes over by supply-
ing the required number of cars and drivers needed to trans-
port these oldsters; and, at 6:00 P.M. on the day set aside
for the expedition, each driver is given the names and ad-
dresses of the four club members he will take on the trip.
The caravan of cars tours half the city in one direction,
viewing the elaborate and colorful displays, and then re-
turns to the starting point. Here the elderly sight-seers
pause for hot coffee and doughnuts; and, in keeping with
the spirit of the season, all join in singing Christmas carols.
Warmed by the hospitality of the food and caroling, the
tour continues on its way through the rest of the city. At

the end of a greatly enjoyed evening, the older folks are-
returned to their homes. 79?

tain qualities, according to the bulletins of teaching tech-
niques issued for_ volunteers or other possible leaders. If
you are to be the teacher of a beginners, group in any part
of the country, the following specific instructions which
are quoted from these should be of value to you:

Conducting Classes (General)

0 Check your pupils’ gear at the beginning of each lesson;
and be sure that boots are laced or tied, bindings sccure
no mittens are missing. Then organize your little group
into some semblance of order as you take them to the slope,
while there, and while returning. Learn each child’s name,
and use it!

0 While teaching one pupil, keep an eye on the others.
Some may be cold; but the main problem is the very young
who tend to wander off. Children must not leave thc class

without your permission.
0 When class is over, return all pupils to the disbanding

place. Collect stray poles, mitts, and so on. You arc re-
sponsible.

0 In case of accident, use your good judgment and act
promptly to help the child. If you must leave the slope,

be sure to turn your class over to another instructor first.
0 If a child has been hurt in your class, submit a brief
written report of the cause, injury and disposition of the
case as far as you know. .

o In severe weather, particularly, watch small fry for cold
feet and hands, frostbite on noses, cheeks and ears. ex-
treme fatigue, wet panties. Don’t risk health!

0 Should you be asked to drive children to a slope, be sure
to bring them back. Be sure that your car carries adequate
liability insurance.

Instruction Procedure

Choice of ground. Beginners often fear a long, continued
slope; choose a short, gcntle one with a level runout. What
is a suitable slope under one snow condition may be ab-
solutely wrong for your students under another. Pupils
should have their backs to the wind, bright sun or falling
snow, if possible.

Expiain the movement. Use clear, precise spcech!
Demonstrate—with comments. One good demonstration is
worth tcn thousand words.

Have each student carry out the movement. Let the wholc
class benefit from your corrcctions. Ordinarily, a position
half-way down the slope is best for running, side-slips and
turns.

Ciear the course! As each pupil completes his movcment.
see to it that he hustles back up the slope, but not in the
downhill path of the next pupil!

Some Requirements for Beginner Skiers

To be accomplished before a child graduates into. the
xt upward class:

eeve Mark: Red tape, sewed horizontally under the Ford
ayre Memorial (or similar) shoulder patch.
errain: Only well-packed, very gentle slopes with level

    
   

1. Put on, take off skis; carrying skis.
2. Walking on level.

3. Step-around turns on level (tails of skis remain on
he snow while tips move in an arc).

4. Falling.

5. Getting up after a fall (accomplished by getting skis
horizontally across the slope below the body, drawing knees
up under the chest and getting up).

6. Running straight (on gentle slope with good run-out).
Feet Hat on skis, one ski slightly advanced in good snow;
increase the lead on deep or heavy, wet snow; boots to—
gether (laterally) on soft or deep snow (somewhat apart on
hard-packed surfaces); use of inside edges, knock-kneed
position on hard snow and ice; arms free of the body, el-
bows slightly bent, hands gripping the poles firmly, hands

being just forward of the hips and below the belt; round- '

shouldered position.

7. Climbing: Sidestep; sidestep and forward (uphill tra-
verse); use of uphill edges to hold a grip on the slope;
stamp.

8. Step-around turns on slope. Poles must be firmly
planted downhill of skier’s body; poles, hands, wrists and
arms carrying almost all of the skier’s weight, particularly
while skis are pointing up or down the fall-line during the
turn.

9. Narrow snOWplow down the fall-line. This is not a
turn exercise, but the first element in controlling speed and
increasing stability. (The fall-line is an imaginary line
down the slope which, if a ball were released at the top of

the hill, would be followed down the slope by the ball.

Usually the most direct line down the hill, avoiding tra-
verses.) Feet flat on the skis, ankles turned neither ex-

tremely in nor out. Knees pressed somewhat forward, up—
per body in the normal position, hands low. Force skis
into a narrow V, heels out; hold the V down the slope.
Tips must not cross. Too much edging causes crossed tips;
too much speed, lack of edging, sitting back, involuntary
turning, not standing equally on both skis.

Snowplow variation. Start down with skis parallel, open
into narrow plow, let skis run together; repeat.

10. Turning. We must maintain both skis on the same

side of the trees which confront us; therefore we are
obliged to learn to turn.

Counter-Rotation: In skiing, one utilizes certain physical
forces to obtain emphasis, push, firmness, decision to the
skis. It is simple, relaxed twisting of the upper body and
arms in a direction counter to the direction one wishes to
turn.

DECEMBER 1957

Rotation: Having drawn back, wound up or counter-
rotated, the upper body and arms are now unwound,

smoothly, firmly, in the direction of the desired turn.
Clutching: At the moment when the rotating upper body

is perpendicular to the skis, all of the muscles of the trunk
of the body are compressed, contained, frozen, so that the
developed force of the unwinding upper body is imparted
to the legs, feet and skis. Allais calls this momentary tens-
ing of the trunk clutching.

In order to obtain force for turning, one counter-rotates;
to develop that obtained force for utilization, one rotates;
to utilize the developed force for turning, one clutches-—
at the moment when the rotating upper body is perpendicu-

lar to the line of the skis. Clutching carries the twist of

the Upper body to the legs, feet and skis, imparting that
twist to the skis in the desired direction.

11. Very narrow snOWplow position, with alternate quick
rotations. Weight equally on both skis; brief, firm rot-
tations, resulting in tiny linked skidded turns down the
fall-line. I

Variation (on good surfaces). Narrow snowplow linked
turns with rotation (as above), but more deliberately
timed, longer turns, making an effort to step directly on
the lower ski as each small skidded turn is executed.

l2. Snowplow single turn_ with rotation. Running down
the fall-line, with skis in narrow snOWplow position, ‘make
a long, separate turn. When the new direction has been
reached, rotation ceases. Attempt to maintain the normal
forward lean of the straight snOWplow; hands slightly for-
ward of the normal downhill running position, tips of poles
back. Avoid sitting back. Never lean into the hill—try to
maintain a position equally over both skis. Practice turns
each way.

13. Linked snOWplow turns with rotation. Hold the snow—
plow position from one turn to the next.

14. Advanced snowplow linked turns. After each snow—

plow turn, the skis are coax/(Ed to some parallel during each

small traverse. ,

Ski Manners

Help tramp the hill; fill and tramp your own bathtubs;
never ski too close to the other fellow; plan to stop some
distance away from him. Never run over your instructor’s
skis! Take your ttirn in class; then get out of the way, and
hustle up the slope out of the next skier’s way. Help the
other fellow—always if he is hurt.

Basic Waxing and Care of Skis

' Paraffin rubbed on thick for wet sticky snow; never for
dry snow. Get it on before the ski bottoms are wet; other-
wise it won’t go on.

' Children can wax their own skis, and carry their own
paraflin. If you don’t teach them, you’ll have to do it.

' Keep skis dry! Stand skis on tips to drain, tails against
the wall, don’t dry them behind the stove (too much heat).
' Check list before skiing: toe-irons, straps; cables adjusted
and in cable-guides; boots laced; both poles with skis. 72?

than putting on a red suit and false
whiskers. It is more than just distrib-
uting toys. Santa must symbolize the
spirit of good will, the spirit of giving.
He is the patron saint of children at
Christmas time.

The Wilmington, Delaware, Recrea-
tion Promotion and Service, Inc., recog-
nizes Santa’s importance in American
tradition. In order that Santa Claus
may not disappoint youngsters by his
appearance, manner, or actions, this de-
partment conducts a training course for
volunteer Santas (not for store or com-
mercial Santas). Anyone who wants
to be a Santa Claus, or has been one on
previous occasions and wants to im-

prove his techniques, may attend. The,

“school” is held one evening about two
weeks before Christmas, and it is free.

The department offers another fine
service: the nominal rental of top-qual-
ity Santa Claus suits, including cap,
wig, whiskers, jacket, trousers, belt,

leggings and an empty sack——~outfits
that originally cost $75.

What do these amateur and novice
St. Nicks learn? They learn something
about Santa’s background: the legend

of St. Nicholas, the American legend
of Santa Claus and The Night Before

Christmas. They learn what the well-
dressed Santa wears, how the costume
is worn, the make-up required, and the
properties he will need.

Costume: This consists of pants, coat
and cap with fur or white trimming,
white beard and wig, wide black belt,
black leather boots, boot tops, black
shoes and a pillow for padding. It must
be worn with an air of assurance and
poise. The beard and wig must fit
snugly; the cap must not fall off. The
pillow must be tied or pinned on
securely.

Make-Up: Santa will need spirit gum,
alcohol, white crepe hair for eyebrows,
rouge and natural color powder. He
may need white shoe polish and a brush,
tapes or pins for the pillow, a good
ruddy, but not beet-red, complexion,
rouged high on cheeks and nose. ’He
must not get make-up on his wig and
whiskers!

Properties: A big toy sack, sleigh bells,
snowshoes and a big book (for chil-
dren’s names).

The well-trained Santa
plans his visits well, knows the places
he is going and plots each visit from
beginning to end. He must know the
names of the children. If there are any

special messages, he must have all this
information in advance.

How Does He Enter?

Procedure :

“Lively and

quick,” with a little noise outside, such
as instructions to reindeer and a jingle
of bells. He enters with a generous,
jolly “Merry Christmas to All,” but he
should not be too boisterous. He should

be careful not to frighten the very little
children.

What Does Santa Say? He talks about

how busy he is, how hard everybody
has worked, how many visits he must
make. He laughs a lot, keeps up con-
versation and asks questions. If he can,
he may dance a little, tell a story, and
call the youngsters by name. He gives
the gifts, listens to the children’s re-
quests, letting them take their time. He

does not promise them things, but asks
what they’d like.

Leavetahing: He leaves as he entered,
with a “Merry Christmas to All,” and
a ingle of sleighbells.

Psychology: Santa must try to be the
person the child has imagined; and
does not stay long enough for the child
to be disillusioned. He must remem-
ber that the two- and three-year-olds
may be frightened, so he doesn’t take
their hands or touch them. If they cry,
he concentrates on others. The three-
to-fives are curious; and Santa asks
questions to keep them from doing so.
The six and sevens may try to show
Santa up, so he talks fast to this age
group.

Tips For Santos. Do not play to any-
body except those who believe. The
ones who do not believe will embar-
rass you and the others, so bypass them.
If there are any handicapped children
in party, be sure to know about them
so 'as not to embarrass them. if

THE NATURAL, innate characteristics which link recreation
education with liberal learning and general education
_ can be found in their common purpose—the realization of
free and abundant living!

Recreation, and hence, to a degree, the proper kind of
education preparatory to its development, is designed in-

herently to stimulate the imaginative and creative powers of
those it serves. Recreation, as a kind of living, is not con-

fined by timc, distance or cultures. Its human values are
unending. It is only without reason if life itself is without
meaning. It is not a specialty to serve the whims of the
frivolous, any more that it is primarily a social welfare
device to soften the blows upon the misfortunate.

Recreation is not so much what one does as it is an atti-
tude of mind which brings from an experience a feeling of
personal satisfaction and enjoyment. Its main goal is the
development and manifestation of personality at its fullest.
Recreation, being a way of living, is, in the first instance,
an end in its own right. The kind of recreation which con-
tributes to our being better persons may help keep us out of
trouble, but this is not its major purpose. It may help
sharpen the learning processes, but this is not its initial de-
sign. It may help tighten the spiritual bonds, encourage
higher codes of ethics and morals, help heal and rehabili-
tate the ill and disabled and even add to oui material
wealth, but these are intentions it sets and victories it
claims not uniquely and basically for itself. It can flourish
only with and through minds that are completely free and
capable of making a choice. Recreation which generates
intellectual, social and spiritual growth, rather than the
leisure behavior which leads to character disintegration, pre-
supposes an appreciation of those life values which make
our behavior decent and good, our actions responsible and
reasonable, and our motivations and accomplishments pro-
ductive and worthwhile.

Recreation is—or could be—a revitalizing element in the
process of education itself.

Recreation education, in its broadest and deepest sense,
has two functions to serve: to help all persons develop ap-
preciations, interests and skills which will enable them to
use their leisure in creative, wholesome and personally re-
warding ways, either with or without the use of society’s
organized facilities and services; and to professionally pre-
pare a limited number of persons competent in multiplying
worthwhile recreation opportunities for others. Both func-
tions lay a strong claim upon the resources of liberal learn-
ing because their missions are invested in factors and con-
ditions which represent living at its fullest.

Liberal and General Education

Liberal education in our colleges and universities is
concerned with discovering and disseminating knowledge.
Uppermost in the h0pes of liberal learning is the cultivation

of the mind and the intellect. Preparation for any field of
professional specialization, including the recreation profes-
sion, cannot take precedence over the one and only point of
departure for the learning process—cultivation of capacities

to think. To attempt to do otherwise is only to prevent the
individual from realizing his greatest potentials for living

and for giving and getting the best from his chosen profes-
sion.

There is also the matter of general education which ad-
mittedly, is interpreted in many ways. The various shades
of intent and understanding of it often depend upon the
status and importance attached to it. In this instance, gen-
eral education is considered to be the adjustment. of educa-
tion to the needs of the people, and a common ground for
cooperative action among people. Although general educa-
tion connotes the study of the humanities, languages, social
studies and natural sciences in such combinations as to give
the student a broad foundation for later specialization of a
vocational nature, a large part of its emphasis appears to be
upon social responsibility, people and their common needs.
It suggests experiences beyond the taking of traditional
courses. It places more emphasis upon behavior and per-
haps less upon given disciplines.

Rccreation Education and Liberal Education

Although recreation education has a dual role to per-
form, as interpreted and used here, it refers only to that

phase of higher academic preparation which prepares a
student for a professional career in the field of recreation.

It is not to be construed here, in any sense, as being a part
of general education and liberal learning even though it is
built upon a foundation of and often contributes to the ini-
plementation of both. Recreation education accepts com-
pletely the belief that liberal learning in itself increases thc
joy of living for people. Surely it makes for a better and
more compctent individual in a profession which involves
wide social, economic and ethical considerations. Recrea-
tion education recognizes that minds which are harnessed
too closely to a restricted area of knowledgc are minds which
are not likely to be free to explore, to discover and, hence.
diffuse learning. It agrees that the ability to think is the
primary prerequisite not only to the full devclopment of the
individual but also to professional competency in any ficld.
It encourages students to take part in a wide range of extra-

class activity—the kind of experiences which make of col-
lege existence itself a laboratory of living; and it acknowl-
edges the need for the student to develop and control his
motor facilities, to create and produce with his hands as well
as his mind, to communicate effectively, to know and enjoy
his natural environment and to help create richer living op-
portunities for others.

How, then, does recreation education differ from liberal
learning? Indeed, the similarities of these phases of edu-
cation are far greater than their differences. Recreation edu-
cation differs only in respect to the requisite of liberal edu-
cation that the student gain command over one discipline
(or subject), and even this difference diminishes depending
upon what one chooses to call a single discipline. If, for ex-
ample, history, rather than the several social sciences in-
cluding history, or philosophy, rather than several of the
humanities including philosophy, are considered as but one
discipline, it would be at this point that the two approaches
part company. Why, then, does recreation education choose
the several social sciences .or the several humanities rather
than the single disciplines within such vital areas of study?

Surely, the values derived from intensive study of a single
subject are obvious; but there is also much intellectual merit
in exposure to related subjects within a broad field because
of the resultant cross-fertilization of ideas and correlations.
This is especially true in recreation, wherein the resources of

the basic disciplines are drawn upon heavily. Most indi-
viduals have only the most limited impressions of what life

can really hold for them, and it is only as they are given
the chance to investigate more than one approach that they
can discover their greatest potentials.

The only other departure of recreation education from
liberal education is the inclusion in the curriculum of pro-
fessional courses, usually in amounts not exceeding a third
of the total number of hours required for graduation, courses
designed to give the student knowledge for helping others
toward more gracious, creative and satisfying living.

A well-planned curriculum in professional recreation prep-
aration is soundly based in the social sciences, the arts and
the humanities. It adds to these the theory and philosophy
of recreation and leisure, several skills in the more popular
types of recreation pursuits and the technical information
required to competently discover and serve the vast range
of people’s leisure needs and interests.

Recreation Education and General Education

The objectives of general education are desirable for all
members of society and necessary for all students, includ-
ing those preparing professionally for the field of recrea—

tion. No claim is-made that recreation education is, or could
be by any stretch of the imagination, a substitute for either

general education or liberal learning. Nevertheless, a sound
curriculum in recreation education provides the kinds of
learning experiences which help attain the objectives of
general education. Whythis is so might be better under-
stood by reflecting upon a few of the recreation education

aspects of the “Objectives of General Education,” as set forth

by the President’s Commission on Higher Education.* These
are enumerated here, but lack of space precludes detailed
comment.

1. To develop for the regulation of one’s personal and civic life
a code of behavior based on ethical principles consistent with demo-
cratic ideals.

2. To participate actively as an informed and reSponsible citizen in
solving the social, economic, and political problems of one’s commu-
nity, state and nation.

3. To recognize the interdependence of the different pe0ples of the
world and one’s personal responsibility for fostering international
understanding and peace.

4. To understand the common phenomenon in one’s physical en-
vironment, to apply habits of scientific thought to both personal and
civic problems, and to appreciate the implications of scientific dis-
coveries for human welfare.

5. To understand the ideas of others and to express one’s own
effectively.

6. To attain a satisfactory emotional and social adjustment.

7. To maintain and improve his own health and to cooperate actively
and intelligently in solving community health problems.

8. To understand and enjoy literature, art, music, and other cul-
tural activities as expressions of personal and social experience, and
to participate to some extent in some formal, creative activity.

9. To acquire the knowledge and attitudes basic to a satisfying
family life.

10. To choose a socially useful and personally satisfying vocation
that will permit one to use to the full his particular interests'and
abilities.

11. To acquire and use the skills and habits involved in critical
and constructive thinking.

Perhaps the most lastingly significant observation which
can and should be made about the close relation of liberal,
general and recreation education is that the last of these
complements and supplements the other two. Recreation
education is not a substitute for them. It does not Weaken
them. There is even good reason to believe that, as the new
leisure envelops us and recreation education goes beyond
the professional preparation of the student to the task of
helping all students make better and more satisfying use
of their leisure, it will help strengthen liberal and general
education—and then not only in terms of serving the educa-
tional needs of the future recreation profession but in help-
ing all students to learn the art of living wholesome, crea-
tive and recreative existences. If and when this happens, we
may make leisure contribute to the order and not the dis-
order of life, or at least help us gain the perspective we need
to pay more attention to human values than to material

things. 72?

NOTE

Cities of the Future

In an article entitled “Five Challenges in Today’s New
Urban Vilorld”1 Dr. Luther Gulick, president of the Insti-
tute of Public Administration, points out that within fifty
years the population of the United States is likely to reach
300,000,000. Of this added 132,000,000 people, from eighty
to ninety per cent will work and make their homes in and
around metropolitan areas. This development within the
short span of fifty years will have a staggering impact upon
municipal and other local governments, and the difficult
problems of today will seem minor ripples compared to the
tidal waves aready sweeping toward us.

Dr. Gulick asks the following thought-provoking question:
“Have you thought what it means in America to see the na-
tional productivity and income rise along with the popula-
tion? Might it not be better to make our cities of 2000
AD. truly adequate and beautiful than prematurely to
shorten the work week further? Make no mistake, this
decision could be made by the American people largely in
terms of taxation and finance.”

Developing Parks

The National Park Service has made public the recom-
mendations of a survey team which studied the organiza-
tion and operations of the National Capital Parks. In its
report the team stressed the-responsibility of the National
Capital Parks for developing and promoting a successful
system of parks for the nation’s capital. It pointed out that
NCP is essentially a metropolitan park system and, unlike
the other national parks and monuments, must be more
directly concerned with meeting the current recreation needs
of the District of Columbia metropolitan area as well as

providing an embellished setting for government buildings
and the preservation of park areas.

The team urged constant study and mutual recognition of
the division of responsibility between NCP and the district
recreation board. It declared that the recommended classi-
fication of parks would lead to clearer understanding of this
division of responsibility and would be an influence toward
more definite tenure by the recreation board which now uses
only such N CP lands for recreation as the N CP permits. “It
appears,” the report continues, “to be reasonable to expect
that, were all elements of recrcation of a public nature in
the District of Columbia to be administered by the district

376

recreation board, greater benefit to the people of the district
would result through force of public opinion.”

The establishment of five divisions in the office of the
superintendent was recommended, with delegation of a large
degree of authority and responsibility to the division heads.
Proposed divisions are: planning, design and construction;
park operations; park police; public use; and administra-
tive. Other recommendations suggest the adoption of a
classification system for the parks; a reappraisal of the
natuie and function of parkways; and the necessity of em-

ploying well qualified personnel in such fields as engineer-
ing, architecture, landscape architecture and horticulture.
Commenting on the extensive system of concessions and

special permits to private operators, the team recommended
that steps be taken now to prepare for complete liquidation
of private interest by the time present contracts expire.

Services in School Plant

In an article entitled “School Buildings—Quality Level
and Cost,”2 Charles D. Gibson, president of the National
Council on Schoolhouse Construction, comments as follows:

The quality level of the educational services that can be carried
on in a school plant is determined by space adequacy—of site, build-
ings and provisions for flexibility to insure long term functional use-
fulness. Proper location, size and shape of school sites controls to a
large degree educational programs and opportunities. . . . Conveni-

ence and adequacy of site largely control the success of supervised
recreational programs.

The educational program planned for a site should determine its
Size. More often than not, false cost analysis reverses the emphasis.

Program trends call for more area; school site sizes will continue to
be larger.

The educational program also determines the requirements of the
buildings to be placed on the site. . . . Time and competence are two
cost factors which must be applied to the price of documentation of
educational program needs. Far better educational space, at less cost,

often results from an intelligent, organized approach to program
space needs analysis.

Time and competence must be purchased in developing the master
plan of a school site if either educational scrviccs or dollar consider-
ations are to be taken seriously. . . . The sacrifice, loss and penalty
paid in educational serviccs for the lack of flexibility is immeasurable.

Speaking of the psychological importance of color, prop-
er acoustics and lighting, Dr. Gibson states that with im-
perfect organs of sight or poor seeing conditions or both,

one uses more than one-quarter of his total energy resourccs
for seeing.

Recreation Services and the Department
of Education

Continuous efforts have bcen made this year to eXpand
the recreation services of thc New Mexico Department of
Education in keeping with its major purpose of improving
the total fitness of all boys and girls in the state as a result
their daily educational-recreational experienccs. The domi-
nant ideas stressed by the division of health, physical edu-
cation and recreation in encouraging the dcvelopmcnt of

satisfactory, progressive and challenging local plans and
programs are:

1. Give top priority to spending whatever funds are avail-
able (earmarked taxes, general appropriations, donations)

2Schools for The New Needs. F. W. Dodgc Corp., 119 West 40th

for leadership, such as professional consultants, part-time
or full-time directors. Such persons should be selected
solely on their ability to perform specific duties, judged by
professional training and previous work experiences.

2. Initiate coordinated planning with schools, cities, coun-
ties joining hands in providing an area-wide blue print for
land acquisition, site planning, selection, design and layout
of park-recreation facilities (swimming, parks, gymnasiums,
picnic and camping areas, playfields, club rooms, museums,

workshops) and selection and placement of appropriate play
equipment.

3. Make sure at the outset of any programs that all exist-
ing school and community facilities have maximum use be-

fore embarking upon a construction program. The develop-
ment of the school as a neighborhood or community center,

referred to as the “lighted schoolhouse,” and the avoidance
of separately operated, duplicate structures or outdoor areas,
saves administrative, maintenance and leadership costs.
Special and additional facilities can and should be provided
after the point of maximum utilization has been reached.

4. An effective, satisfactory or balanced recreation pro-
gram includes all types of indoor and outdoor activities for
all ages throughout the year without over-emphasizing one
type of recreation, such as competitive athletics for boys to
the underdevelopment of other phases, such as crafts, hob-
bies, informal dramatics, camping, and so on.

5. Keep in mind when equipping play areas, especially for
small children, that inexpensive, attractive, functional and
safe items for play can be provided, locally, by school or
recreation personnel, parents and civic groups. The under-
lying factor is the imaginative use and conversion of avail-

able materials (trees, pipes, barrels, autos, tires) on a do-
it-yourself basis.

6. Obtain o§icial recognition for the field of recreation.
This means, in the case of cities and counties, the passage
of an ordinance, the creation of a board or a department,
the inclusion of a recreation item in the budget. From the
standpoint of the schools, it means a statement of board
policy, the formulation of a program, and the designation
by the superintendent of an individual responsible for the

supervision of the program or its coordination with city-
county oiiicials.

7. Maintain a representative citizens’ group, a council,
committee or association, including youth, that stimulates
thought and action in park-recreation programs and works
closely with the school superintendent, city council, park-
recreation commission, board of county commissioners, rec-

reation executives, and all local organizations concerned
with recreation.

8. Develop a long-range financial plan based upon the
fact that the schools and the community will have to regard

cigarette tax proceeds as a supplement to other sources of
income. The earmarked taxes will not be suflicient to depend

upon as the sole SUppOl'thl’ an adequate program.—GEORGIA

Midget Football Survey

The Michigan Recreation Associa-
tion has recently completed a survey of
midget football for boys eleven to thir-
teen years of age in the state of Michi-
gan. The two-part questionnaire cov-
ered (1) operation of existing pro-
grams and (2) opinion of recreation
and education authorities on the value
of the program.

Twelve cities of the twenty-three re-
plying to the first part reported that
they are operating midget football
leagues. Teams average six to a city,
although one city has 124 teams. All
use park and/or school facilities ex-
clusively. Eight cities use the regula-
tion 160’ x 360’ field; the other four
use areas ranging from 40’ x 60’ to
160' x 240’.

Of the thirty-two reSponses to the
second section of the survey, twenty-
three came from city recreation depart-
ments and nine from school authorities.
Seventeen respondents favored midget
football, thirteen were Opposed to such
a program in any form, and two ex-
pressed no opinion. Some of those who
opposed tackle-type football for this
age group reported that they are oper-
ating a successful touch football pro-
gram. Sixteen of those favoring the
program felt that competition should
be entirely on the local level; only onc
had no objection to state, regional or
national tournaments.

There was virtually unanimous
agreement that all games should be

played after school or on Saturdays,
and fifteen cities felt that professional
coaches should be employed. Twelve
cities indicated that the weight bracket
for the specified age group (eleven to
thirteen) should be eighty-five to one
hundred and ten pounds. Six cities
recommended using a field measuring
120’ x 240’; five, a regulation field,
and four suggested various sizes from
80’ x 180’ to 160’ x 240’. Thirteen
cities indicated that a complete uniform
should be worn, and nearly all the re-
spondents specified the substitution of
rubber gym shoes for regulation leath-
er football shoes.

The consensus seems to be that the
acceptability of midget football de-
pends largely on the Sponsorship, the
degree and type of supervision, and

the extent to which outside interests
gain control.

Frequency of Accidents

Many facts worthy of note by recrea-
tion workers are contained in Nature
and Frequency 0/ Accidents Among
Elementary School Children in New
York State,* which reports the conclu-
sions of a study by Gerald J . Hase. The
study covers ninety-two New York pub-
lic elementary schools, outside New
York City, during a seven-month peri-
od. It is confined to accidents occurring
in school buildings, or grounds during
school hours or in an activity super-
vised by school personnel before or
after hours, and having a follow-up
after first aid.

0f the 524 accidents reported, 64 per

of New York, Albany, N. Y., 1957.

cent occurred on the playground and in
the gymnasium, although these two
areas ranked only seventh and sixth re-
spectively, with regard to severity of
injury. Two or more pe0ple were in-
volved in 28 per cent of the accidents,
the majority of them caused by col-
lisions; either equipment or supply was
involved in 27 per cent. Of the 131 ac-
cidents attributable to the physical
plant, the greatest number resulted
from a slip on the floor or ground.

Wrestling, with two accidents in 532
exposures, is the only activity that
seems to be hazardous for this age
group. In the physical education class
instruction program, games had the

were reported for 1,819 exposures,
which probably reflects the Special pre-
cautions taken to safeguard children in

a swimming situation.

It appears that the use of all of the
playground apparatus except the giant
stride is relatively safe.‘ The develop-
mental apparatus, such as the climbing
structure, rings, hanging ladder and
hanging bar, had a lower accident rate
than recreation apparatus such as teeter,
slide, swing and merry-go-round. Fifth-
and sixth-grade pupils appear to be less
interested in playground apparatus
than pupils in the lower grades.

Schools with asphalt or dirt under
apparatus had the highest rate for all
types of accidents; those with sand,
lowest. Unorgauized noon-hour play
resulted in the highest accident rate.

Among the specific recommendations
made were the following:

During frec play periods, the num-
her of pupils in any one area should be
restricted and carefully supervised;
teachers should teach children how to
use equipment and supplies safely; all __
playground apparatus should have some 
resilient material such as sand under- '
neath it; all areas where noon-hour ac-
tivities are offered should be properly
supervised; the noon-hour program in
elementary schools should consist of di-
rected organized play or organized frce Q

play or both. 3’?"

U. 3. Air Force. Once in a very great while there is a rare

and unusual development that.‘cap {the imagination, en-

courages and inspires the progssiioi‘nr' One of these is now
taking place in the U. S. Air" orce.' It-was a thrilling and
exciting experience to hear Gilonel Roland E. Sliker, chief
of Air Force Personnel Services Division, explain to dele-
gates at the 39th National Recreation Congress the new con-
cept and policy governing recreation for Air Force per-
sonnel and their families. In proclaiming the underlying
trnluth,l Colonel Sfiker emphasized that Air Force personhel
and their families, as American citizens, needed, wanted,
and deserved the best recreation possible.

National Institute in Recreation Administration. The solid

The plan calls for a recreation department at"eve_ry:‘..w_
Force base of reasonable size with an experienced recrea-
tion manager in charge. The segmented recreation pieces
for the first time are to be coordinated, reinforced, ex-
panded and enriched under a professional recreation man-
ager. Existing positions will be strengthened and broad-
ened to give more professional meaning. The four major
commands have appointed recreation supervisors at the top
command levels who will service the respective bases and
help them establish recreation departments. Recreation in the
Air Force now becomes a career for trained leaders under
Federal Civil Service, with positions defined to relate to
community recreation systems, making possible the free flow
of recreation personnel from Air Force to other agencies and
vice versa. This new development will be welcomed by all
serious professional leaders for it strengthens and broadens
the foundation of the recreation profession.

Individuals now registered in our personnel services, and
those registering in the future, should indicate whether or
not they are interested in opportunities with the Air Force
as well as with other types of agencies. The variety of pro-
fessional recreation positions with the Air Force include:

regardless of age or position, needs to stop learning and

growing, present one of the most encouraging signs of the
times.

The second National Institute in Recreation Administra-
tion held at the 1957 Congress, like its predecessor in Phila-
delphia a year ago, filled its quota of one hundred execu-
tives and supervisors with applications placed on reserve.
lts theme, “Organizational Teamwork and Creative Lead-
ership,” was accented by the excellent Long Beach Recrea-
tion Department staff who dealt with the “Coordinated
School and Municipal Administrative Pattern,” special
phases of program, and the securing and financing of facili-
ties. A specialist from industry spoke on the selection and
training of supervisors, and the most creative developments
of four outstanding recreation agencies were presented by
their able executives.

The institute reached its climax with a lively brainstorm-
ing demonstration and a rapid-fire lecture with colored
slides on how to be creative by Dr. Paul Douglass.

The question has been asked: “How can the National
Recreation Association give so much for such a small insti—
tute fee?” The answer is found in the fact that no instruct-
ors, no lecturers and no committee members receive any
honorariums or expense money; and there is no rental fee,
since the host city provides, free of charge, the facility
which houses and gives privacy to the institute. The insti-
tute fee this year included: considerable printed material
prepared by the instructors, some of which was mailed for
advance study; a copy of The Annals; the special institute
tour; the institute luncheon and refreshments at the coffee

intendent of recreation.

break. Even the certificates were designed, individually let-
tered and provided by the Long Beach Recreation Depart-
ment without charge to the institute. The temptation is
strong to start mentioning names, including the very excel-
lent Institute Committee, but space would run out before
we could complete the list.

Suggestions are now being received (please send yours
promptly) for subjects, procedures and instructors for the
1958 Institute. Communities have a right to eXpect their
executives to develop in the broad range of functional abil-
ity in leadership strength and over-all comprehensiveness.
Executive development is pretty much an individual respon-
sibility. General Electric requires its executives to make
job specifications for their personal growth. Can we do less
than to suggest as much for community leaders and recre-
. ation executives? The 1957 Institute had quite a bit to
say about those executives and supervisors who spend most
of their time passing judgment on fellow workers, always
negating and killing ideas of others before they have a
chance to develop. As Dr. Douglass stated, “The greatest
modern assassin is the person who kills ideas before they are
born.” Executives who will remain safe from this crime
are the ones who continue to study, learn and grow, regard-
less of age or position. I

The Annals. This oHicial publication of the American Acad-
emy of Political and Social Science devoted its entire Sep-
tember issue to recreation, under the title, “Recreation in
the Age of Automation.” The 80,000-word volume, written
by twenty-seven different leaders, is a handy reference and
'surveys the field constructively. There are controversial
issues as might be expected in such a large volume and con-
sidering the scope and number of writers involved. Recre-
ation leaders might enhance the status and understanding
of recreation by getting local citizens’ groups and women’s
clubs to use this publication for next year’s study book.

Internships. The new NRA internship program, started this
past year, has enrolled twelve ‘trainees. Five have completed
the year’s program, received their certificates and are now
located in permanent positions. The others will finish dur-
ing the spring and summer of 1958. Intern vacancies exist
and these excellent opportunities will be available for June
graduates. Departments participating in the internship pro-
gram to date are Los Angeles County and Oakland, Cali-
fornia, Portland, Oregon, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Phila-

delphia in the community recreation field and the Indiana
and California Departments of Mental Health.

Personnel Standards in Community Recreation Leadership.
This revised and enlarged publication of sixty-one pages
should be in every recreation library. Recent requests for
information indicate that some have not secured copies.
This is the fifth and most comprehensive revision since the
report was first published in 1930. Job specifications and
personnel standards materials involve twenty-eight different

positions—a practical and handy reference for board mem-
bers, city officials, educators and recreation people.

Recruiting. The most encouraging news in this area is the
movement toward local state committees. Many of the state
recreation societies and associations have established state
recruiting committees and a few have worked out scholar-
ship programs. Some major projects are under considera-
tion and much more needs to be done. Recruiting for a pro-
fession is not something that can be turned over to one or
two agencies for aid. Insofar as recreation is concerned,
there must come a new and enlarged sense of responsibility
from the profession. We do not need clever techniques as
much as a deep concern for the needs of people.

The Association’s National Advisory Committee on Re-
cruitment, Training and Placement of Recreation Personnel
is concerned with all references in this article. Suggestions
for improving the personnel situation are welcome and may
be sent to me at the NRA Personnel Service Department
or to the new major division chairmen: Recruitment—Wil-
liam Lederer; In-Service Training—Al Cukierski; Under-
Graduate Education—Harlan Metcalf; Graduate Educa-
tion—John Hutchinson; Placement—Frank Evans.

Personnel Survey. The NRA Hospital Recreation Consul-
tant Service reports that the national study to determine the
role of recreation in nine thousand hospitals and institu-
tions is well under way. The report is expected to be avail-
able in the spring. Although not all are under recreation
titles, the early returns indicate that there may be five
thousand full-time and another five thousand part-time rec-
reation workers in this field. Like the new developments in
the Air Force, this is yet another indication of the growing
need and demand for more recreation personnel. 7’}?

Developments at Illinois

Dr. Charles K. Brightbill, professor

of recreation at the University of ll-
linois, writes of the establishment of a
department of recreation (it was for-
merly a recreation curriculum) at his
school. The department is a “primary
unit of education and administration”;
it is “established for the purpose of car-
rying on programs of instruction and
research in a particular field of knowl-
edge”; and it has “the fullest measure
of autonomy consistent with the main-

tenance of general college and univer-

sity educational policy. . . .”

Concurrently, the board of trustees
has changed the status of the school of
physical education to college of physi-
cal education, the title of its director
to dean, and established a department
of health and safety education. Both
new departments remain within the
college of physical education.

Indiana Enrollment

Professor Garrett G. Eppley of the
Indiana University School of Health,
Physical Education, and Recreation re-
ports the enrollment on both the under-
graduate and graduate levels shows a
substantial increase over last year, with
approximately sixty undergraduate ma-
jors and fifteen undergraduate minors.
Graduate majors total twenty-eight liv-
ing on the campus, five driving to the
campus for recreation classes offered
at night, and ten or more graduates in
recreation enrolled in the extension
centers. This makes a total of over
forty graduates enrolled in recreation
as well as a number of doctoral candi-

dates minoring in recreation.

Scholarships

0 The Michigan Recreation Associa-
tion is now giving six scholarships——

DECEMBER 1957

three for $200 and three for $100—to

juniors and seniors attending Michigan
colleges and universities who are ma-
joring or minoring in recreation. These
scholarships are currently being given
to students enrolled in Michigan State
University, Central Michigan College
and Eastern Michigan College.

0 The second recreation scholarship
given by the Evansville Community
Center was awarded to Susan Walton.
The $2,000 scholarship is made possi-
ble from the $1.00 year dues of teen-
age members of the center.

Selection of the winner is one of the
projects of the student council of the
center, and the winner is determined on
the basis of academic achievement,
leadership, and participation in extra-
curricular activities in high school as
well as in other youth agencies. During
the summer vacation periods Susan will
be employed at the community center
as a paid staff leader to gain practical
experience in recreation programs.
This is the second scholarship offered

by the center.

Wisconsin Registration Plan

On January 1, 1958 a professional
registration plan will be established for
all recreation leadership personnel in
Wisconsin. It is sponsored by the Wis-
consin Recreation Association and is
to be administered by a five-member
professional registration committee
headed by H. C. Hutchins, associate
professor of education and coordinator
of recreation curriculum at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin.

Fundamental Education

Nancy Ann Ferguson, a recreation
major from Oregon State College, is
currently in Mexico for nineteen months

of study and work under a special grant
by the U. S. State Department. She is
one of five Americans selected for the
program, which is conducted at the
Latin American Fundamental Educa-
tion Center at Patzcuro as a project of
the United Nations Educational, Scien-
tific, and Cultural Organization. Some
120 representatives from nineteen Latin

United

States delegation are participating.

American countries and the

The five Americans were selected
from the professional fields of recrea-
tion, health, homemaking, literacy, and
economics. Miss Ferguson, a recrea-
tion major, was recommended by the
National Recreation Association.

The first seven months of the assign-
ment are devoted to classwork at the
education center, followed by eight
months of work and observation in
rural villages of Mexico. The final four
months include study, research, and
completion of a thesis. Each participat-
ing country finances its own delegation.
The U. S. State Department grants
cover eXpenses plus a salary for the
nineteen months.

Internship Vacancies

0f the twelve enrollees under the
NRA Internship Program, five have
completed their work and received their
NRA certification of recognition and
the others are finishing their year’s
work; therefore, vacancies will be avail-
able in the summer and fall of 1958.
Prospective graduates interested in the

program should apply now to W. C.
Sutherland, NRA Personnel Service, 8

West 8th Street, New York City 11.

Summer Work Program

The success of the NRA Student Sum-

mer Work Program was led to the con-
sideration of a similar program for the
summer of 1958. Last summer ten ree-
reation students in training served on
Air Force bases as youth activities di-
rectors and leaders, working with mili-
tary and civilian personnel and their
families. Their salaries were paid by
the bases and transportation was pro-
vided by the Air Force. Both the stu-
dents and the Air Force found the pro-
gram a valuable and profitable experi-
ence. if?

A very successful Congress, co-spon-
sored by four organizations and the
National Recreation Association, was
held this year. The sessions pertaining
to rccreation for the ill and handi-
capped were numerous and well at-
tended, with attendance ranging from

fifty-five to two hundred and fifty-five
at each session. There were two work—
shops, one on group dynamics and one
on rhythmical expression, and a very
successful “Bazaar of Seasonal Themes
for the 111 and Handicapped,”* with
excellent displays, was an informal
swap shop of party ideas for this group.

The Hospital Section opened with Dr.
Edward Stainbrook, professor
chairman of the Department of Psychi-
atry at the University of Southern Cali-
fornia School of Medicine, discussing
“The Hospital—A Therapeutic Com-
munity.” He said it is essential to de-
velop a “conceptual framework” of a
hospital, with a scientific understanding
of what goes on within it. It is not just

and

an aggregate of individuals. He empha-
sized the importance of meaningful
communications, saying that how well
the therapeutic tasks which hold the
community together are accomplished
depends upon how well communica-
tions are developed between individual
staff members as a staff team.

Among other hospital meetings, sum-
maries of which are available from the
NRA were: “Hospital Recreation Vol-
unteer—My Training and Supervision,”
chaired by Lillian Summers, American
Red Cross hospital consultant; “Rec-
reation for the Mentally Retarded,”
chaired by Mrs. Frances Grove, super-
visor of recreation at Pacific State Hos-
pital, Pomona, California; “Recreation
for Nursing Homes and Homes for the

Aged,” chaired by Annabelle Story,

“Workshop on Group Process in Hos-

Rynearson, director of volunteer activi-
ties at the Veterans Hospital, Sepulveda,
California, which had three sessions.
The session on “Neurological Involve-
ments for All Ages” was chaired by Bir-
ger J. Rudquist, chief of special service,
Veterans Administration Hospital, Palo

Alto, Californiaaand addressed by Dr.

rector of California Rehabilitation Cen-
ter and clinical professor of physical
medicine at the University of Southern

speaker used slides to show a compre-
hensive study of the structure of the
nervous system. He talk involved the
structural arrangement 'of the neurolog-
ical system and its abnormalities.

The Veterans Administration Work-
shops were well attcnded. Just for em-

Hospitals was “New Horizons for Hos-
pital Recreation.” (If readers of “Hos-

One of the best speeches ever given
in my opinion, has now been published
in pamphlet form and is ready for dis-
tribution, through our organization or
the University of North Carolina. The
speech, by Dr. Joseph B. Wolfie, medi-
cal director of Valley Forge Heart In-
stitute and Hospital, Pennsylvania, is
entitled Recreation, Medicine and the
Humanities; and it is an entirely new
slant on recreation for the ill and handi-
capped. A condensation of this appears

REATION.

New York City is now considering
the position of a recreation director to
coordinate and supervise the thirty-two
municipal hospitals within its depart-
ment of hOSpitals. Let’s hope that the
budget department will make this pos-
sibility become a reality. If this hap-
pens, New York City will have the first
city-wide hospital recreation director
in the country.

with batteries is only five pounds! The megaphone has a
maximum power output of 31/2 watts, resulting in an oper-
ating range of more than a quarter-mile under normal noise
conditions, with exceptional voice quality. It is completely
self-contained, with speaker, amplifier, batteries and micro-
phone in one sturdy weather-resistant unit, with a pistol
grip handle and trigger control. Ideal for athletic contests,
maritime and industrial use, or any place where distance
and/or background noise hinder voice power or intelligi-

bility. Pye Corporation of America, Telecommunications

O A new drink vending machine now on the market de-
livers a cool cup of either plain milk or flavored milk. The
machine has an automatic coin changer; drinks sell for
ten or fifteen cents,“ and size of drink can be adjusted from
six to nine ounces. The milk is dispensed from five gallon
cans which are sealed by the dairy at the time the dispens-
ing valve is placed on the can. In the machine, the milk is
held at a safe low temperature at all times, and has an
automatic switch control which prevents sale of milk if, for
any reason, the temperature goes above the safety level.

chester, New Hampshire.

RECREATION

 

Laughter Is a Wonderful Thing

Joe E. Brown, as told to Ralph Han-
cock. A. S. Barnes, 232 Madison Ave-
nue, New York 16. Pp. 312. $4.95

After Joe E. Brown’s hilarious talk
at the 39th National Recreation Con-
gress in Long Beach (and his “casual”
reference to his book), we feel our
readers, and especially the delegates,
will be interested in hearing more about
it. Although it was published in 1956,
there are many who have not seen it.

Joe E. Brown fits easily and well into
the recreation picture, for, in addition
to being a memher of the Los Angeles
Recreation Commission and a national

sponsor of the National Recreation As-
sociation, he is a man of laughter. He

loves it, and he inspires it -— good-
natured, rollicking, and even affection-
ate, laughter. This book, his autobi-
ography, is the tender story of a father
and of his family. As you read it, you
will laugh some, but more often you’ll
be serious; and you will know him so
much better—this humanitarian and
beloved comedian!

New Understandings of Leadership

Murray (3. Ross and Charles E. Hen-
dry. Association Press, 291 Broad-
way, New York 7. Pp. 158 $3.50.

This book covers a wide range of ma-
tcrial and through its many references
and bibliographies will call the reader’s
attention to many important publica-
tions on leadership. In fact, it is a sum-
mary of recent thinking and research
on the nature and meaning of leader-
ship. The authors have reviewed a
large number of studies and have drawn
on many sources for their information.

The book is organized into three
parts. Part One deals with theories of
and clarifies many of the new concepts
of leadership; Part Two deals with the
requirements of leadership in terms of
personality, special qualities, and skill;
Part Three discusses the leader’s role
and the development of a leadership
program.

The authors point out a fact all too
frcquently overlooked-that a leader-

I DECEMBER 1957

PUBLICATIONS

Covering the Leisure-time Field

ship development program is not only
complex and time-consuming, but it
costs money. We are accustomed to the
fact that more tangible items, such as a
building, require much preparation and
the skills of architects, engineers and
construction workers, all of which adds
up to a considerable sum. However, this
same acceptance of cost is not readily
understood when it comes to the less
tangible matter of training and develop-
ing leaders. Perhaps the more we learn
about leadership and understand it, the
more we will be able and willing to
invest time and money wisely in the
staff development and leadership as-
pects of the job. Apparently, it is this
lack of understanding of leadership that
is responsible for so many ineffective
leadership training programs. We rec-
ommend this book to all those who may
have jurisdiction over others as another
helpful aid to the understanding of the
leadership phenomenon.—W. C. Suther-
land, NRA Recreation Personnel

Service.

101 Money Making Ideas for Clubs

Nellie Zetta Thompson. Public Af-
fairs Press, 419 New Jersey Avenue,
5.15., Washington, D.C. Pp. 50. Paper,
$1.00.

Scores of ways whereby your organi-
zation can raise money for worthy
causes are spelled out in this book by
Dr. Nellie Z. Thompson which is just
off the/press. It not only specifies proj-
ects with concrete details, but it also
discusses plans, problems and policies.
The interests and needs of practically
every type of group are taken into con-
sideration.

The Science of Skin and Scuba
Diving: Adventurng with Safety

Under Water

Developed by Conference for Na-
tional Co-Operation in Aquatics. As-

sociation Press, 291 Broadway, New
York 7. Pp. 306. $3.95.

Here is authoritative information for
the people who are interested 'in know-

ing about adventuring with safety un-
der water. Developed by the Confer-
ence for National Co-Operation in
Aquatics, in which the National Recre»
ation Association is a memher, this vol-
ume was prepared by outstanding au—
thorities, including Army and Navy ex-
perts, medical specialists and experi-
enced divers and trainers from all parts
of the country. It is the first standard
guide on skin and scuba (self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus) div-
ing and its purpose is to insure safe and
scientific diving as a hobby, sport or
vocation.

Among the subjects treated are the
medical aspects of diving, gases used
for scuba, types of apparatus, currents,
visibility and marine life, first aid for
diving accidents, scuba training tech-
niques and club organization.

This book is required reading for all
who are interested in this rapidly grow-

ing sport—George D: Butler, NRA

Research Department.

Seven Steps
to Creative Children’s Dramaties *

Pamela Prince Walker. Hill and
Wang, 104 Fifth Avenue, New York
11. Pp. 150. $3.00.

Our readers may remember the arti-
cle by Pamela Walker, “Lively Ideas
for the Summer Play,” in the April 1957
issue of RECREATION. As that article——
and this book—indicates, Mrs. Walker
does not write from any ivory tower.
She is well-trained in drama and has
worked in this field a number of years.

This book was written while she was
drama and dance director for the rec-
reation department in Charlottesville,
Virginia. It makes delightful reading
hecause the author remembers and
knows what goes on inside a child’s
mind. She eXplains in simple, informal
style the techniques of awakening in-
terest of his senses, of expressing him-
self through movement, and of develop-
ing a better understanding of himself
and the world around him. Teachers,
recreation readers and anyone inter-
ested in children’s drama will be de-
lighted with this book.

We read it with great interest while it
was in manuscript form, and asked
Grace Stanistreet, well-known specialist
in creative dramatics, and NBA special-
ist Grace Walker to evaluate it before
we recommended it to a publisher. Their
response was complete agreement as to
the soundness and the value of this
book. It is made even more valuable by
the inclusion of three original dramatiz-
ations for children—plays that can be
put into immediate use.-—— Virginia
M nssehnan, NRA Program Service. W

CHILDREN’S BOOKS

Christmas belongs to the children;
_and what better time of year to give
them books—the keys to learning, ad-
venture, make-believe?

How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Dr.
Seuss. Random House, 457 Madison
Avenue, New York 22. Unpaged. $2.50.

Another delightfully imaginative
book for the very young, about the
Who’s of Whoville, by the well-known
children’s author, Dr. Seuss. The
Grinch, who hated Christmas, tried to
stop it-——but he found he couldn’t! At-
traetively illustrated in red, and black
and white.

Praying Mantis, Harriet E. Huntington.
Doubleday 81 Company, Garden City,
New York. Pp. 4-4. $2.00.

A boy around eight or nine who is
fascinated with the wonders of nature
would love this. It would also be a
worthwhile addition to any nature li-
brary. Every other page carries a beau-
tifuI photograph of this insect that
is so much like an animal.

The Bird Watchers, Marjory Bartlett
Sanger. E. P. Dutton.& Company, 300
Fourth Avenue, New York 10. Pp. 164.
$2.75.

Older children will like this absorb-
ing story based on a love of birds, which

grew out of the installation of a bird
feeder at Christmas time. The author,
Mrs. Sanger, does editorial work for
the Massachusetts Audubon Society.

Dear Garbage Man, Gene Zion (pictures
by Margaret Bloy Graham). Harper &

Brothers, 49 East 33rd Street, New York
16. Unpaged. $2.00.

This is one of those juvenile books
with equal appeal for the adults who
are still young in “heart. Stan, the new
garbage man, has all sorts of funny
adventures when he tries to save dis-
carded objects from his truck’s chewer-
upper. His saving spree reaches a logi-
cal and inevitable climax. The many
bright, detail-filled sketches by Mar-
garet Bloy Graham provide half of the
story and endless amusement.

Paper, said to have been invented in
China back in 105 A.D., has been used

388

in decoration and design throughout
the centuries. Many who have been in
China, Japan or Korea remember the
amazing paper folding that even small
children there do so easily. Many who
have visited Poland, Mexico, and the
Scandinavian countries remember the
intricate and beautiful paper cutting
and folding of those countries.

As an art medium, paper is light and
springy. It can assume only very sim-
ple f orms—cones, cylinders, box shapes,
and curved scored shapes. It is two
dimensional; but, even with these limi-
tations, more and more artists are find-
ing it a most exciting art form and
a most popular medium for displays
and promotion work. Craft leaders have
discovered again that it is a medium
through which children can express
their best creative and imaginative
power.

Here are three books, listed in the
order of the simplicity of their projects
and teaching techniques. The first is
primarily for use with elementary
school children. Its projects are cIever,
original, simple, and full of imagina-
tion. Any teacher or craft leader could
use it as a starting point, from which
children will take over with pleasure.

The second presents a combination of
simple paper cutting and paper sculp-
ture, leading into free space designs.
This book, too, can be used by leaders
fairly ineXperienced in this medium.

Both books are well illustrated with
photographs and include many direc-
tions showing the necessary steps.

The third book is something else

again. It is one of the “Studio How-
To-Do-It” series, and its author is an

artist, outstanding in England for his
imaginative and novel paper sculpture,
sought after by stores, manufacturers
and decorators. It deals with profes-
sional paper sculpture, and would be
extremely valuable to college or other
art classes seriously interested in this
area of art work.

It is fascinating to read; the pho-
t0graphy is superb. The section on the
outstanding paper sculptors, their styles
and photographs of their work is fas-
cinating. Anyone can enjoy this book,
but only a trained artist could make
use of the instructional material in it.

EDITOR’S NOTE: In considering do-
ing more in paper work, don’t forget
How To M ake Shapes In Space by Toni
Hughes, reviewed in RECREATIO'N,

The Seventeen Book of
Young Living

Enid A. Haupt. David McKay Cam-
pany, Inc., 55 Fifth Avenue, New Yark
3. Pp. 237. $4.95.

This book does not fit into the usual
pattern of books reviewed here, but we
felt that it was too good not to call
to the attention of our readers. It
is written specifically for young pe0ple
—but anyone working with young
people will find it very revealing, and
useful in understanding and helping
that difficult-to-work-with group.

It is written with wit, informality,
realism and sympathy. Its contents will
be the answer to many teen-agers find-
ing the growing-up process full of prob-
lems.

Recreation leaders will be particular-
1y interested in those chapters dealing
with parties for girls, mixed parties,
getting along with adults, manners, and
an entire section on entertaining. Lead-
crs can also use this book as a basis for-I
special charin or better-grooming:
classes. 3"

And, finally, any leader with a teen-
age daughter or niece or friend will find
it an excellent gift idea for Christmas, a
birthday, or any other occasion.
