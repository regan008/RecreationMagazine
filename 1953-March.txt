N0. 2 in the Games Series, 
D D SINGING GAMES is just off the press!

- \Vondering what to do with a group of hve-to-sevens? Here’s
the answer! Singing games that will keep them happy for hours
and bring them back for more. The summer playground leader,
the camp counselor, the volunteer leader will find that this collec-
tion bridges the gap between the safe harbor of the sand box and
the faster tempo and competitive spirit of the active play area.

Music and aetion, as well as the words, are given for each game.

Some are old favorites, others will be less familiar to mOSt leaders;
all have been carefully chosen for their appeal to the small child.
Outdoors or indoors, in the home, recreation center or play area,
in fair weather or when it rains, wherever the iust-started-to-
schoolers are gathered, these games will be played—and played

again.

%AN’S CLIMB
from the mud
up the rugged slope
of civilization is the
story of a struggle
for self-expression.
It is the record of a
never-ending fight
to discover
and more creative talent within him
and to release its power. Intrinsic to
this progress has been the constantly
tighter clutching of the doctrine of the
personal dignity and individuality of
the human being.

The degree to which self-discovery
and self-expression have develOped in
the time dedicated to survival, as dis-
tinguished from the time available for
pursuit of personal desires, has varied
with the rung of the ladder to which
man has advanced as well as with his
material and spiritual achievements,
the relative amounts of required work-
ing and resultant self-choosing time,
and the limitations set by economic,
sociological and political factors.

Those pursuits which the individual
chooses in his earned leisure, with the
primary motivation the gratification in
the doing, are called recreation. It is
thus apparent that it is not the what
but the why, when and how that iden-
tify recreation. {For recreation is not a
matter of the motions but of the emo-
tions. The activities (physical, men-
tal, emotional, spiritual, social) are
but the tools of the trade, the outlets
of creativity. They provide the satis-
factions of the desire for self-expres-
sion, the longing for recognition and
belonging, the appetite for compcti-
tion, the hunger for adventure—hun-
gers as real as those for food and sex
and sccurity, hungers for which grati-

fication, sometimes to an alarming de-
gree, is denied in working hours and
by regimented experience, hungers
which must be satisfied to insure per-
sonality and character growth, social
adjustment and balanced living.

Recreation is an end unto itself in
that it is indulged in for its own sake,
not primarily for its dividends in spe-
cified kinds and amounts. Although
recreation pays off, sometimes hand-
somely, in numerous valuable curren-
cies, the paycheck of satisfaction in
the doing provides its motivation and
form of compensation.

Recreation is a universal need, a
rightful expectation in a democratic
society. It is part and parcel of demo-
cratic living. It is of the essence of
the American way of life.

And in the present-day high-speed
society dominated by the magic of ma-
chines and the miracles of science—an
era of mechanization, specialization,
standardization, urbanization and ma-
terialism in which the symbols gener-
ally worshipped are the dollar, fire-
power, horse-power, miles per hour
and revolutions per minute—each turn
of the clock accentuates the reSponsi-
bility of society to prepare its citizens
from the cradle on for the arts of
leisure.

For, with all their blessings, ma-
chines frightening civilization
with their manufacture of a plethora of
leisure hours which the people are ill-
prepared to accept. Rich in recreation
time, poverty-stricken in recreation at-
titudes, aptitudes, skills and habits, so-
ciety must mobilize for war against
the evils of its materialism and mech-
anization. This it must do by prepar-

are

ing its members to live, by providing
more adequate recreation opportunities

through its public and voluntary agen-
cies and social institutions, and by giv-
ing wise direction and applying dis-
creet control to its profit-motive com-
mercialized recreation, a strong and
necessary ally.

The right to choose one’s pursuits
in one’s own free time is democracy’s
Fifth Freedom.

Recreation’s purpose is not to kill
time but rather to make time live; not
to help the individual serve time but
to make time serve him; not to en-
courage people to hide from themselves
but to help them find themselves.

Recreation may be basking in the
splash from a sunset or capturing its
color and mood on canvas.

It may be that well-executed putt
and the volunteered praise of a friend-
ly competitor.‘

It may be scaling a peak and in
breathless triumph surveying the
stretching spaces and enjoying one’s
insignificance.

It may be the drawing of a bow
across the violin strings or surrender to
a moving symphony.

It may be strolling through the
woods and noting the Dolichonyx or-
yzivorus or just startling the bobolink,
or surprising that “little bird with a
dozen bright colors.”

It may be the dance step or finding
and polishing pretty rocks, reading a
book or conversing with a friend.

It may be picnicking—the mothers
spreading the contents of the baskets
to the shouting laughter of playing
youngsters and the bragging by the
men.

But never is it measured by what the
participant does to or with the object
or situation. Instead, recreation is
concerned with what the doing does to
the doer.

For recreation is an important seg-
ment of the living process. By their
recreation peoples’ lives and personal-
ities are shaped, communities take on
complexion, nations develop cultures.
Recreation takes its place with work,
religion and education as the living
areas which add up to life.

in bookstores throughout the country
in April, under the title Your Rand

travel and vacation information on all
parts Of the country, copiously illus-
trated and including helpful, upto-

when playing in unauthorized play
spaces are discussed in detail in a new
bulletin recently published by the Na-
tional Safety Council. Among hazard-
ous areas are Open pits, excavations,
abandoned mines, construction work
and industrial property, empty houses,
railroad property, dumps and junk
yards. According to the bulletin,
teachers, educators, playground and
municipal authorities—as well as pa-
rents—have serious responsibilities “to
provide and maintain attractive and
adequate places for recreation.”

) LETTERS ARE Now Gonzo OUT from
the National Recreation Association to
a number of leaders and recreation
workers, suggested by field representa-
tives of the association as having a
deep concern for, and a special com-
petence in, the recreation program
field—as a first step in the formation
of a national advisory committee on
recreation program and activities.
This is a part of the association’s ex-
pansion of services and its establish-
ment Of closer working relationships
with the recreation leaders in its vari-
nus districts.

y A REPORT To TIIE CALII‘oasu LEOIS-
LATURE, presented by State Director of
Natural Resources, Warren T. Ilannum
and State Director of Public Works,
Frank B. Durkee, proposed a system
of roadside parks, or wayside areas,
for the motoring public. The Division
of Highways. while reconnnending that
an agency ,with park experience handle
the job. emphasizes that location: and

Highways approval, to insure integra-
tion with long-range highway planning
and the free and safe movement Of
traflic. The plan followed in some
states of building a large number of
small roadside rests, or parking turn-
outs, with one to three piCnic tables
and a trash container, is analyzed in
the report but -is opposed on the
grounds of safety and economy Of
maintenance. It is considered prefer-
able to build a smaller number of
strategically located installations with
complete facilities for off-highway
parking, four to eight tables, sanita-
tion, water supply and perhaps fire-
places.

Important Notice

This issue of RECREATION carries
our annual index. which completes
Volume XLVl. Hereafter, however,
the annual index will appear in the
December issue of the magazine—-
thus terminating cach calendar year.
In order to accomplish this change
of publication date, each issue of
RECREATIOS for the remainder of
1953 will be designated as belong-
ing to Volume XLVl (A), and V0 -
ume VLVll will start with the Janu-
ary 1954- issue. This means that
Volume XLVI (A) will he a sup-
plementary volume of seven issues
rather than the usual ten. We hope
that this will be clear to those of
you who are having your year’s
issues bound for your professional
library and purposes of easier refer-
ence. If there are any questions
regarding this, please do not hesi-
tate to write us about them.

Ski Tow Safety

Sirs:

I read with interest Mr. Sieker’s let-
ter in the December issue of the REC-
REATION magazine discussing safety de-
vices which should be attached to all
ski tows.

I don’t know how I neglected to
mention this in my article, but we very
definitely have a safety, which auto—
matically comes with our ski tow, of
the gate variety. We use our tow at
the bottom of the hill, therefore, do
not need the gate; but at the top of the
hill our pulley is thirty feet in the air,
and twenty feet beyond where they get
off.

Besides, the motor is geared so that,
if any obstructions stop the rope for a
second, the motor will automatically
shut off. Therefore, I feel that we have
definitely covered all necessary safety
angles with our tow.

I was glad to see that Mr. Sieker
brought this important item to the
readers’ attention, as it is a very nec-
essary part of operation.

For Framing

Sirs:
We are interested in securing some
pictures that would be suitable for

office. The very attractive covers of
RECREATION magazine would be excel-
lent if we could obtain from you: (I)
permission to use the pictures in this
manner, and ( 2) cuts of certain cover
pictures so that we might have them
made larger.

Since the covers are so attractive, it
might be that National Recreation As-
sociation has already had large prints
made of these that would be suitable
for framing.

Maori vs Lum mi

Sirs:

It was a pleasant surprise, indeed,
to find Miss Cassell’s description of
the "Maori Stick Came” in RECREA-

TION magazine for January, 1953. For
many years recreation leaders of the
Pacific Northwest have been enjoying
and teaching essentially the same
game, calling it “Lummi Sticks” after
the Lummi Indian tribe of Puget
Sound. They were reputed to have
played it as a gambling game using
deer bones or elaborately carved sticks
which they manipulated with great

skill.

Whether the game is of Lummi or
Maori origin is secondary to the fact
that it is a wonderful socializer for
people of all ages and learning the
game usually is a hilarious experience
for all the participants.

One variationpwe have. used with
success is the playing of the game in
foursomes (we call it doubles). One
set of partners sits at right angles to
the other as in a card game. The first
twosome begins the game and the song
while the second set starts its rhyth-
mic pattern two beats later. All four
players sing in unison. This results in
a continual pattern of sticks being
thrown across the “no hand’s land” in
the center of the square and requires
previous practice in pairs or “singles.”

The variations of routines and
rhythmic patterns are many and the
participant’s ingenuity and coordina-
tion are challenged in playing it.

Many thanks for giving us more
background on “Maori Sticks” and the
additional words and music.

rector, Santa Rosa, California.

as anything we put up is used con-
stantly. We ust put up a swing in our
back yard and at least fifty children
use it every day, so you see that it
must really be something sturdy. Gau-
hati is a town of about 80,000 and
there is not one other swing in it and
absolutely no play equipment for chil-
dren, or a park area for them to play
in. We go home on our furlough in
April and so have decided to wait un-
til we come back to try to set a play-
ground up here. We hope to get di-
rections for putting up park play
equipment while we are home.

I wish that we had known of the
visiting recreation people (Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas E. Rivers) so that we
could have asked them to come here.
Gauhati is a two hour plane ride from
Calcutta and perhaps they would have
found it possible to make us a visit.

Profcssional Rcsponsihility

Sirs:

ln speaking of a really professional
attitude in the recreation field, which
would naturally result in each worker
assuming personal and individual re-
sponsibility for thc growth of his pro-
fession, I would likc to say, among
other things, that I feel that too few
of us subscribe to RECREATION. l sus-
pcct that your circulation is negligible
with respect to what it really should
be; and I think every recreation work-
cr should have easy access to, or sub-
scribe to, your magazine. I find that
almost none of our field workers do
subscribe to RECREATION. All of this
led me to openly so comment to our
superintendent, saying that I would
bet money that there are not ovcr twen-
t ° persons in our department who read
t is fine magazine and that the num-
ber of individuals in our department
who subscribe for it could probabl be
counted on the fingers of two hantfi.

Further, I felt that we should be
ashamed of the fact that so many of us

call ourselves professional workers
when wc don’t even read or subscribe
to the one magazine which is our me-
dium of expression. I stated that I
would bet that the national circulation
of RECREATION is much lower than
most of us would assume; and that it’s
about time we gave the magazine a
boost by encouraging and stimulating
a healthy eagerness to read it.

And of course our superintendent,
William Frederickson, Jr., called my
bluff by asking me if I would like to
speak before the next meeting of our
city-wide staff of recreation directors—
in behalf of RECREATION? Would I do
a “pitch-talk” for the purpose of stim-
ulating a more active interest in the
magazine? And of course I agrced
wholeheartedly to do so—in fact I am
looking forward to the opportunity.

ERNEST B. EHRKE, Recreation Direc-

tor, Harbor District, Los Angeles.

0 Mr. Ehrke has said, in a later letter,
that informal discussions of this sub-
ject with recreation workers have elic-
ited variations of the following answers
as to reasons why the worker does not
subscribe to RECREATION: (1) “I have
never been asked;” (2) “I cannot af-
ford it;” (3) “The magazine is'gearcd
for the top-fiight administrator, rather
than for us who work in the field.”

In answer, we would like to say: (1)
Please extend our invitation to sub-
scribe to all members of your depart-
ment.’ Mr. Ehrke answers the other
two points as follows: (2) “Can you
afford not to subscribe, if you are will-
ing to assume responsibility for your
own professional growth;” (3) “Let
us raise our sights, and our standards,
so that wc can consider ourselves as
professionals every bit as much as the
superintcndent or supervisor. This
publication should be regarded as ‘our’
magazine, and if there is something
we would like editorially, we can sure-
ly write a letter and so request articles
of that nature. Or better still—why not
write an article along the lines you
have in mind and submit it to RECRE-
ATION yourself? Anyone can criticize,
but thc professional person realizes
that he helps himself if he hclps others.
Let’s all pitch in, thereby incrcasing
circulation, therchy increasing adver-
tising appeal, and thus in turn creating
more funds for RECREATION magazine
to work with.”

We would likc to add that RECREA-
710x carries one whole section for pro-
gram leaders. Sec any issue of the
magazine—Ed.

Consideration

It is not often possible for the editor
to come to an immediate decision re-
garding the use of a manuscript. Many
things must be taken into consideration
when we are concerned with the pres-
entation of a well-balanced issue—
timeliness, specific plans for future is-
sues and the total program. A play-
ground article, for instance, if submit-
ted in the fall or winter, when more
seasonal interests are paramount, may
be more effective if held until spring,
when thoughts are turning to the ap-
proaching playground season.

Remuneration

Recreation, as the monthly publica-
tion of a non-profit, service organiza-
tion, cannot pay for the material it
publishes. It must depend for free con-
tributions upon the leaders who wish
to share their experience with others
in the field, and upon friends of the
recreation movement. It should be ap-
parent that this fact imposes limita-
tions upon the solicitation of materials,
and it is why we do not publish more
articles on certain subjects. We do,
however, try to meet the needs of rec-
reation leaders for materials to help
them to better carry out their respon-
sibilities, to grow professionally, to
keep up-to-date on news and trends,
methods and techniques, new program
ideas—and we strive to give them am-
munition to help them to interpret the
needs for recreation to local citizens
and lay groups.

As the May, 1952, issue of Social
Education state so well, “The best an-
tidote for what a reader considers lack
of balance in the magazine is for that
reader himself to write or to encourage
the writing of what he feels is more
appropriate material. That, and letters
to the editor!”

ADULT RECREATION

ADULT RECREATION CLUBS are the backbone of the play-

ground and recreation movement in Decatur, Illinois.
They provide the grass roots function that we hear so much
about but so seldom see. They are made up of people of
all walks of lifehrailroad workers, foundrymen, industrial
workers of all kinds, school teachers, lawyers, clerks, insur-
ance men and even those who are retired. The first club
was organized in 1935 as a community club in a heavily
populated district with a small park. The area needed to be
developed and it was felt that such a club could be of vital
importance. Two cities where similar organizations ex-
isted were studied and their good features used in setting
up the first elub.

lts objects were “to cooperate with the recreation board
and the park board in encouraging neighborhood unity
for the purposes of obtaining, for that community, oppor-
tunities for wholesome recreation throughout the year; to
promote neighborliness and sociability; and to make a
united effort toward the advancement of the playground
and recreation movement in Decatur.” More directly the
purpose of the club was to arouse community interest
enough so that it would be a source of help to the recrea-
tion movement. Tax supported recreation had been voted
down twice by Decatur. Recreation had been conducted
only on a piecemeal basis. Money to run the recreation
program had been secured from tag days, schools, the city
government (very small amounts), the Community Chest,
private individuals, industries, lodgcsgfiremen’s associa-
tions and others. The tax question was to be proposed
again and the organization of adult recreation clubs could
help focus attention upon the need for recreation. The
clubs could help best by being interested, by having a
challenge before them. It was much easier for them to
see the needs of their own immediate neighborhood than
to see the needs of the entire city. Thus the first club was
born. Its immediate projects included raising money for
lloodlights for the ball diamond.

Othcr clubs followed and with the help of all of them,
plus Wl’A money for a demonstration program. the first
tax for recreation in Decatur was voted in 1936. Actu-
ally the clubs have been more useful since the program was

tax supported than they were in getting it passed. Their
number has varied from five to eleven. Over a period of
years some, for reasons beyond their control, have had to
cease functioning. Some have disbanded because their
playground was on private property which was eventually
used for building purposes. Others have closed because
larger parks were built in adjoining neighborhoods and
interest was focused in those directions. New clubs have
been organized to take care of new parks so that at pres-
ent there are eight active elubs. They are operating under
the same objectives that were set down in 1935, although
the methods‘ and techniques used in attaining these ob-
jectives have changed. It is interesting to note that all
clubs have agreed upon a standard set of by-laws which
have the approval of the recreation and park boards.

Membership is open to any person over eighteen years
of age who resides in the neighborhood and is actively in-
terested in the objectives of the organization. No dues are
permitted. The park and recreation boards have always
insisted that membership be free and open to all. Partisan
politics, religion or labor questions are not discussed. The
sole joh of the clubs is to improve the recreation facilities
and programs. The latter includes all that goes with a
good recreation program—sociability, neighborhood unity,
helpfulness to others and so on. Each elub elects officers.
and no member can hold .ofliee for more than two years
in succession. This prevents the same people from run-
ning the clubs year after year, and forces them to contin-
ually search for new members. Monthly meetings are held,
at which time financial reports are given, new members are
welcomed and projects for the playground are discussed.
Board members or staff workers from both the park and
recreation boards are welcome at these meetings, which
usually take the form of a “pot luck” meal. This, again,
makes for friendliness and sociability.

liaeh club is given permission to operate a concession
stand in their park in order to make money for projects.
All rules of the city health department must be observed,
as well as all pnrk ordinances. Advertising in the parks is
forbidden. Clubs are not permitted to sell tobacco or
alcoholic beverages. or to peddle their goods to bleacher-
ites, all sales being made at the concessions. Parents may
buy their children refreshments if they wish but they

needn’t be bothered by having someone hawking his wares
in front of them, or by the possibility of a bottle being
thrown from the crowd at the umpire. Again by park
board rule no one is allowed to be paid for working in the
concession stands. This places considerable responsibility
on the members of the clubs as they operate their stands
five to seven nights a week. They work hard to get enough
members so that no one has to work more than one eve-
ning a week. Usually two couples will agree to work one
night a week; and if anyone of them cannot work, it is
their responsibility to get a replacement. As a final word
on concession stands, it is required that all clubs turn in
financial reports to the park and recreation boards imme-
diately after their annual meeting in September.

In order to obtain permission to operate a concession
stand, the clubs agree that all money made must go back
into the park, either in program or facilities. All projects
must be approved by the park and recreation boards. Rec-
reation activities that clubs have paid for, or assisted
with, include movies, dances, picnics, crafts, parents’ night,
ball games, play days and tot lots. They never pay lead-
ership costs as this is a responsibility of the recreation
board. However, they join hands with the recreation board
and supply money for the rental of movies———about fifty-
l'ive dollars per season for each club—and extra supplies
for the craft program. They secure musicians for dances
and provide transportation for intra-city events. Thcy as-
sist (never financially) in securing outstanding ball teams
for their parks. They have picnics in the summer and
parties in the winter for their neighborhood youngsters
and adults, and do many other things to help the recrea-
tion leader.

While all such help has been important, the big boost to
the recreation movement has come from money invested
in facilities and equipment. Over $80,000 has been put
into permanent playground facilities and equipment since
the clubs were organized. Some of the things they have
paid for include floodlights, swings, slides, climbing appa-
ratus, basket and volley ball equipment, cyclone fencing for
backstops and safety fences along base lines, bleachers,
circle ball courts, storage buildings, tot lot fencing and
equipment, roller skating areas, scoreboards, public ad-
dress systems, iireplaccs, blacktop under basketball goals

MARCH 1953

and around concession stands, dust settlers for the ball
diamonds, concession stands, spray pools and bicycle racks.

The procedure followed when a club undertakes a proj-
ect is first to get in touch with the superintendent of rec-
reation. He knows the park board policies and can help
the clubs, particularly if they are asking for some facility
that will be hazardous, a nuisance or too costly. He knows
pretty well what each park needs to make it a better recre-
ation area and many times is asked for suggestions. He
tours the parks several times annually with the park super-
intendent, and they are in agreement as to what each park
needs. Each club is encouraged to plan projects five years
in advance and to follow the plan as closely as possible.
After preliminary meetings and numerous phone calls, the
clubs present their requests in writing to the park board.

The two superintendents many times visit the parks with
special committees from the adult recreation clubs to dis-
cuss the projects, such as the location of a tot lot or a
spray pool. The park board agrees to furnish the labor
for installation of new equipment if the club pays for ma-
terials. Therefore, if the park board approves the written
request, the go ahead signal to the park superintendent is
given. The park superintendent orders the materials that
are needed and bills the clubs for them. Clubs are asked
to submit their projects in the fall of the year so that the
park board can order all materials and get work started.
Many times such articles as tot lot tables, bicycle racks
and spray pool pipe can be assembled during the slack
winter months and be ready for installation when the sum-
mer season gets under way. Projects are undertaken in
the order in which the park board receives them, thereby
getting away from the question as to who comes first.
Most projects can be completed before the summer season.
Each year the clubs will average spending from $3,500 to
$4,500 on much needed improvements. Small clubs will do
well to clear $300 in one season while large ones will clear
as much as $800 or $900. Sometimes a club will save its
money for one or two years in order to complete a particu-
lar project. This is discouraged as much as possible, how-
ever, as clubs seem to get into arguments as to how to
spend their money when the balance gets too large.

The Adult Recreation Council is an outgrowth of the
adult recreation clubs. After seven or eight years, it was
found that the clubs were changing their by-laws to suit
themselves. Some clubs were antagonistic toward the park
or recreation board and sometimes both. Club members
expressed dissatisfaction over not knowing the “what and
why” of policies that were set up by the two boards. In
short, a clearing house was needed, a place where'adull
club members, park board members and recreation board

579

members could get together and discuss their problems.

As a result the Adult Recreation Council was organized.
The objectives set up are the same as those of the adult
recreation clubs except for one which is similar but more
definite. It is “to strive for the best of recreational facili-
ties and leadership for Decatur and cooperation with every
adult recreation club, the Decatur Park District Board and
the Playground and Recreation Board of Decatur.” This
pin pointed the problem—the lack of wholehearted coop-
eration on the part of all three groups coneerned. Actually
the desire to cooperate was present but lack of knowledge
of what the problems were made it difficult to work to-
gether successfully.

The council consists of two delegates and the president
from each adult club (the two delegates to be appointed
annually by the incoming president of each club). All
clubs are entitled to three voting delegates. In addition,
one member of the park board and one from the recreation
board are members. The recreation chairman of the PTA
Council is a member as well as the superintendent of parks
and the superintendent of recreation; the officers are presi-
dent, vice-president, secretary and treasurer. The execu-
tive committee is composed of the officers of the council,
one member of the park board, the superintendent of
parks, one member of the recreation board and the super-
intendent of recreation.

The council meets four times a year, in February, May,
September and November. New officers are elected in No-
vember. Meetings consist of discussion of policies, pro-
grams and projects of the clubs and the park and recrea~
tion boards. They present an opportunity for adult club
members to question any policy that they don’t approve of
or don’t understand. Short sessions are set aside to train
new officers of the clubs in order that they may more fully
understand their duties and responsibilities. Many times,
misunderstandings are avoided or straightened out because
of such gatherings. Adult club members find out that their
park board member is trying to help them and that the
recreation board member is thinking of their welfare and
their interests. Likewise board and staff workers get to
know adult club members and their problems. Quite often
members of one club answer the problems of another.
Once in awhile speakers are brought in, but not often.
The judge of the county court, a former playground leader,
and the president of the recreation board have spoken to
the council. Recreational movies are occasionally shown.
The best work of the council is done when refreshments
are served after the official business of the evening has
been transacted. This is the time when people get ae-
quainted and can really talk over their problems in a
friendly atmosphere. The eight adult clubs and the rec-
reation staff take turns at being host to the council mem-
bers.

Advantages of having such clubs are many. They en-
courage neighborhood unity as they bring together pe0ple
with a common interest, promote neighborliness. New
people in the neighborhood are made welcome. The clubs
have helped recreation develop much faster than it could
have without this community interest and, by working with

580

the park and recreation boards, have resulted in a united
movement for more and better recreation in Decatur. They
live up to their objectives very well; and, they work so
hard for improvements in their parks that they are bound
to take pride in their accomplishments. It is really and
truly a grass roots program. Members are constantly look-
ing for ways and means to improve their areas and their
programs. They want the best for their children.

Parents spend many hours at the park with their chil-
dren. For one thing they know where their children are.
The children are playing in the park while Mother and Dad
are working in the stand or watching the ball game or the
movies. Parents often play such games as horseshoes or
softball with their children; or at other times, simply visit
with them. This is a fine example of family recreation.

The members of the clubs take a tremendous interest in
the community in which they live. They not only take
great interest in their neighborhood recreation, but also
the recreation of the entire city. The Adult Recreation
Council helps bring this feeling about by keeping its mem-
bers informed about city-wide recreation.

The recreation board, park board and their professional
workers have a feeling of confidence when they know that
they are not working alone in their efforts to do a good
job.
‘The clubs help focus public attention on the work that
is being done or on the work that needs to be done. With
the publicity that they receive, the public gets a good pic-
ture of what is going on in recreation. Budget cuts would
be difficult indeed, with so much neighborhood interest.
With an average of fifty members in each club, it means
that an organization of over four hundred people is vitally
interested in what happens to the recreation movement in
the city. Their voices will do much more good for recrea-
tion than that of the paid staff workers.

The clubs are a source of help to the playground lead-
er and the administrative staff. Having someone to go to
for assistance is very encouraging. A compliment from a
citizen and a tax payer accomplishes wonders. Knowing
that someone in the vicinity is interested in the program
spurs the leaders to greater efforts and achievements. They
aren’t hurt by having someone “look over their shoulder”
once in a while. Money is made available to them for
things that the recreation department cannot furnish. The
support of the clubs gives them a feeling of confidence.

The community comes in for its share of benefits. Good
citizcns make good neighborhoods and good neighbor-
hoods make good communities. The community needs to
be proud of its assets. Decatur has much to be proud of,
but at the top of the list is its park and recreation program.
The adult recrcation clubs are the backbone of the recrea-
tion prograni.

Professor Rizzuto’s

BASEBALL ACADEMY

Lawrence Lader

They were some of the toughest kids in
New York. They came from the tenements of
Harlem, Brooklyn and the East Bronx, from
street-corner gangs, from broken homes. Most
of them were in danger of becoming serious cases of de-
linquency. But instead of running wild on the streets dur-
ing fall and winter afternoons, the last two years they have
flocked to a new kind of school—started by Professor Phil
Rizzuto of the American Baseball Academy.

At Rizzuto’s school twenty-four hundred boys from thir-
teen to eighteen, divided between the New York and Brook-
lyn branches, do nothing but learn baseball. Each boy gets
five one-hour lessons in pitching, catching, batting, first
base, infield and outfield play, thirty lessons in all. The
faculty is every fan’s dream. Headed by Rizzuto, one of
the 'great short-stops of all time, it includes such stars as

Gene Woodling and Gil McDougald of the Yankees, Gil
Hodges and Ralph Branca of the Dodgers, Sid Gordon of
the Braves, and Saul Rogovin of the White Sox. The whole
school is free; for the American Baseball Academy is a
non-profit philanthropic institution which not only keeps
thousands of boys out of street-corner gangs and pool
rooms, but also provides its pupils, regardless of race,
creed or color, with a practical workshop in democracy.

“An extraordinary school!” New York District Attor-
ney Frank Hogan exclaimed at the opening day ceremo-
nies. “The teachers are heroes to the pupils. The boys
come early, batter at the door to get in, and stay as long
as permitted.”

The classrooms are thc two huge armories of New York’s
165th Infantry and Brooklyn’s II Corps Artillery. Classes
are held each afternoon at 3:30 and 4:30, starting in No-
vember and running for twelve weeks. Many pupils travel
over an hour to get there. Carfare means so much that
they often walk miles to save a dime.

Walk into the huge, block-long New York armory any
aftcrnoon and you see six courses going on simultane-
ously. At one end of the floor, Woodling’s class works at
the batting “tee.” In another corner a semi-circle of boys

0 Baseball clinics of this
kind are conducted each
year by an increasing num-
ber of rccreation depart-
ments throughout the
country. They are a means

of bringing local boys to-
gether for practical lessons
in good sportsmanship and
democracy, as well as for
training in the game of
their choice.

 

watches McDougald demonstrate the pivot at second base.
Classes under Ralph Branca, Sal Yvars and Gene Her-
manski are scattered in other corners of the armory.

Dick Kryhoski of the St. Louis Browns has his first base
pupils making the double-play throw to second, then hus-
tling back to the bag. “Come on, big man,” he shouts to
little thirteen-year-old Frankie Lefiernan. “Don’t waste all
that motion.” He stops the play and calls the class around
him. “You boys are doing the same thing I did when I
started. When the ball’s hit to first and you’re fielding it
for the double, don’t take those little steps getting the ball
off. Just pivot on your right foot, swing your left foot
toward second, and throw.”

Kryhoski sends the ball to Leffernan again, and the kid
scoops it and throws in one easy motion. “Now you’re
getting it!” Kryhoski shouts.

At the batting “tee” sixteen-year-old Raymond Bur-
roughs takes a hard swing at the ball, which is suspended
from a pulley, and misses. “Keep that left foot in place and
swing easily,” Woodling instructs. “Don’t try to murder
it.” The kid takes his cut again and hits the ball squarely.
“Now you’re swinging easy,” Woodling says. “Watch the
way Johnny Mize does it. He doesn’t have to swing hard
to get it out of the park. It’s good to have a model. I
learned a lot from Mize.”

In another corner of the armory the catching class under
Sal Yvars of the Giants is throwing out runners stealing
second. “Wait a minute,” Yvars shouts to a chunky, dark-
haired youngster making his fourth throw. “You’re all
doing the same thing, wasting motion. You get up from
your crouch and take a couple of lunging steps forward.
It’s got to be done in one simple motion. Just move your
left foot over in line with second base and get your throw
off with a snap of the wrist. Don’t rush it. It’s all in the
wrist.”

The boys try it again. “Much better!” Yvars shouts.
“You keep on improving like that and in a couple of years
you’ll be giving me passes to the Polo Grounds.”

There are hundreds of boys on the floor, but the armory
is quiet, each pupil awed by the'privilege of working
shoulder to shoulder with baseball stars'he had previously
only been able to idolize from afar. When the Baseball

581

Academy decided to accept whole gangs, trouble was ex-
pected. But there has not been one fight in two years, not
even shoving for a place in line.

i This adulation of its major league stars is what makes
.the Baseball Academy such a strong force in combatting
j uvcnile delinquency. A leader of one of the toughest East
Bronx gangs applied for admission last year through his
local community center. “But you’ll just break windows
and raise hell like you do here,” said the center’s skeptical
'director.

“Naw,” said the kid. “If me mother says ‘shut up,’
maybe 1 don’t. If you tell me ‘shut up,’ maybe I don’t.
But when Phil Rizzuto says ‘shut up,’ I shut up.”

“Kids like that look up to baseball players,” Rizzuto
said recently. “It’s very flattering but it’s also a respon-
sibility. We major leaguers can help a lot of boys do right
instead of wrong.”

This is the real challenge before the Baseball Academy—
how to direct such adulation toward constructive ends.
One step is to insist that the boys maintain passing marks
at high school and junior high school. Dick Kryhoski of
the St. Louis Browns, for instance, makes a regular prac-
ticc of checking his boys’ marks every few weeks. “Every
big leagucr knows he has to have something to back him
up,” Kryhoski told his class recently. “I’m studying for a
college degree now. If you get those A's and B’s at school,
you can do it too.”

One of Rizzuto’s pupils last year, a seventeen-year-old
youngster from Harlem, was cutting high school contin-
uously. “He wasn’t a dumb kid,” Rizzuto said. “There
was something worrying him. Finally he told me his par-
ents were so poor he had to go to school in dungarces. Ile
wanted to quit and go to work. I told him how tough
things were in my youth. Even when my father was on
relief in the depression, he made me stick out high school.
Gradually I got the kid to work at his gradcs. They got
better, and he graduated. He was a pretty good ball player
so I got a Yankee scout to look him over. They never
signed him, but that little attention did wonders for his
scchonlidcnce. Now he's got a job and is doing fine.”

Leonard Panessa, a sixtcen-ycar-old student at Machine
and Metals School, was getting forty's last year until Gcne
Woodling took an interest in his case. “Gene really
straightened me out,” said Pancssa who returned to the
Baseball Academy again this year. “Ilc made me see that
when you try to get out of work, you only make things
harder for yourself. Now I’m specializing at cabinet-mak-
ing in school. 1 still want to be a ball player but l'tn go-
ing to graduate first.”

The Baseball Academy can get results like these because
its instructors have been picked not just for their rcputa-
tions on the diamond but their ability to handle boys.
Many of them came from poor families and faced the
same problems in their youth. Rizzuto grew up in Brook-
lyn and sold papers during oil-hours from school while his
mother took in sewing. llc used ~his first check from
professional baseball to buy food that went on the family
table that night. Ralph Branca was one of seventeen chil-
(Iron in a family struggling to keep its head above water.

The Baseball Academy was launched by Rizzuto almost
accidentally. Dining with Malcolm Child, author of many
baseball books, at the height of the juvenile delinquency
and narcotics investigations, he complained that there was
so little :1 man like him could do to keep kids from going
wrong. “Why not teach them baseball?” Child suggested.
“Your name alone could take plenty of kids off the streets.”

liizzuto saw the possibilities—not just himself but a
whole staff of baseball stars for the faculty. He spoke to
other ball players. They were enthusiastic. Child, an ex-
perienced organizer, drew up the plan for the Academy
and sent it to Bernard Baruch. Baruch not only liked it
but spoke to other prominent New Yorkers to enlist their
support. Today, many of these men head the Academy's
board of directors. The chairman is John J. Bergen of
Child’s and Louis Sherry, Incorporated; the treasurer, Jack
1. Straus of Macy’s. The directors and sponsors include
Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, James A. Farley, Eddie Can-
tor, Ncwbold Morris, Bernard Gimbcl, Ward Melville of
Thom McAn and Herbert Barchoff of Eastern Brass and
Copper Company.

The Baseball Acadcmy operates on a budget of $15,000.
Its only paid executive is Child who is in full charge of
the school. Last season Rizzuto taught classes every day.
llandicappcd by an ulcer this season, he teaches only oc-
casionally but works on curriculum problems with the stall.
The twclve major league instructors are paid a small week-
ly salary only because the Academy's directors felt they
should be compensated in part for the more lucrative win-
ter jobs they have had to sacrifice. The annorics are lent
free by the National ,Guard. Bats and gloves are donated
by their manufacturers.

Detcrmincd that the Baseball Academy’s classcs should
be filled by boys who needed help most, llizznto and Child
set up a cooperative plan with 102 welfare agencies and

-selllcmcnt houses, including the Young Men's Christian

and llebrcw Associations, Catholic Youth Organization,

Neighborhood House. Boys can apply to the Academy
only through one of these organizations. With each appli-
cation the organization writes a detailed memorandum of
the boy’s special problems at home, school or in the fields
of behavior, personal relations or delinquency. This en-
ables the Academy to pinpoint its help.

Cases sent by the agencies range from the most undis-
ciplined boys on the verge of real trouble to those suffer-
ing from serious inferiority and deprivation. Of one thir-
teen-year-old kid with six brothers and sisters, and an un-
employed father who had left the house, the agency wrote:
“This is a shy child who needs to gain confidence and
have help in growing up.”

At the other extreme, the Stuyvesant Community Center
noted on the records of another youngster from a broken
marriage and a family crowded into a cold water flat: “He
is sneaky and foxy, needs to be constantly watched.”

The Academy knows that its major league instructors
must spend nearly all their time teaching baseball. To
handle such social and psychological problems, therefore,
it has hired a staff of social service experts. Four social
workers are on the classroom floor each day at both the
Manhattan and Brooklyn armories. But words like “social
work” are never mentioned. This special staff, known to
thc boys as “counselors,” tackles its problems quictly and
unobtrusively.

At the Brooklyn armory recently, case workcr A. C.
Sterling noticed one boy standing at the fringe of his
class, afraid to take his place in line for batting instruc-
tion. Checking the records, Sterling found the boy came
from an orphan asylum, was marked as withdrawn, insc-
curc and necding scrious attention.

“The youngster seemed more interested in Gil Hodges
than the instruction itself,” Sterling said. “Later when
Gil ran out of halls, I asked the kid if hc could lend his to
thc class for a while. He ran over and gave it to Gil with
a big smilc. Just being able to do a favor for his hero
did that boy good. Later Gil told him that becausc he was
so conscicntious he had been selected to come early each
day to take charge' of the bats. That boy was so happy

MARCH 1953

you’d think Gil had just made him first baseman of the
Dodgers.”

One of the most difficult cases last -year was an over-
weight, flabby kid. He ran and threw like a girl and never
mixed with the others. The case worker got in touch with
his mother and found that the family lived in a tough
Lower East Side district. To shield him, the mother had
kept him at home, made him ahnost afraid of contact with
the world. The case worker spent many sessions talking
with her, making her realize how important it was for her
son to be accepted by his friends and mix in neighborhood
activities.

In addition, Sid Gordon, whom the kid especially ad-
mired, got the youngster to understand that although he
might never become an expert ball player, he could chan-
nel his interests to other fields. Soon he was organizing a
ball team in his own neighborhood with the backing of lo-
cal merchants. He began to write Sports for the school
paper and became its star reporter. At the end of last sea-
son’s classes he was awarded the tr0phy for “the most im-
proved boy of the year.” '

But the real proof of whether the Baseball Academy has
helped “boys do right instead of wrong,” as Rizzuto ex-
pressed it, comes after they have finished the course. What
happens to them then? “Last year we sent a particularly
difficult group of boys,” said Miss May Mathews of Hartley
House. “They were trouble-makers at high school and run-
ning wild in the neighborhood. The Academy seemed to
tone them down. But that summer when a hotel man
asked me to send up some boys for a few months to work
as caddies, I told him I couldn’t recommend them without
reservations. He took them anyway, and the boys made

good. Not once all summer did they cause the slightest
trouble.”

The Baseball Academy may soon be helping thousands
of other boys stay out of trouble in congested, tenement-
ridden cities all over the country. The Boston Post has
already come out in favor of a school there. Chicago and
Elizabeth, New Jersey, are investigating the possibilities of
establishing branches. “Why shouldn’t every city have a
school like this?” Bernard Baruch asked recently. “When
you can do such wholesome things at so little expense?”

Most of the boys at the Academy have their own dream
of going on to the major leagues. Two of the boys are
already 011 their way. Last year'Teddy Brown, who had
only played softball until he came to the Academy, was
signed by Sunbury, a Class B team of the New York Giants.
This year another Academy boy was signcd by Oshkosh,
a Giant Class D team. Their fame has already spread
through the sandlots of the city—practical proof to every
pupil that hard work at the Baseball Academy gets results.

For the youngest pupils, who have to wait to reach this
magic circle, the Baseball Academy has its Special rewards.
“Yuh’d always get cheated playing baseball in the park,”
twelve-year-old Ronnie Sparaco said recently. “The older
boys would bat twice. Yuh couldn’t do anything about it
because they’d sock yuh. But next summer it’ll be differ-

ent. Wait’ll they find out that Phil Rizzuto’s been coach-
ing me.”

From a talk by Bernard I. Kahn, Commander, MC, USN,
presented at the 34th National Recreation Congress.

To BEST understand how to use ree-

reation as a therapeutic tool for
the mentally ill or emotionally dis-
turbed, it is essential to understand
how normal people use recreation for
emotional enrichment. Once knowing
this, we should apply the same prin-
eiples to those we seek to help. In
short, recreation should be an index
of exercise tolerance, commensurate
with age and maturity, a concept of
imagination; freedom to use ideas and
images, all of which are unfettered by
the immediate data of living. This
brings us precisely to the question,
“What is recreation?”

Recreation is the application of en-
ergy to meaningful activity in one’s
leisure time. Flugel,1 Erikson,’ Wald-
er,’ and others, point out that the use
of leisure to enhance well-being is a
desirable social aim. It is recognized
that the individual ability to handle
and tolerate meaningful activities,
other than the particular work which
brings one economic and social sup-
port, might well be considered as an
index of an individual's cultural at-
tainmcnt.

Recreation for

Neuropsyehiatrie

Patients

By Bernard I. Kahn, Janet Reese, Maryles Nahl

Erikson states further that play is
that activity which the individual does
not have to do; and from a scientifie
point of view, recreation should be
play. At the same time, it should be
a means of using reality. From a ther-
apeutic View in an institutional set-
ting, recreation may be defined as a
pleasurable flight from the immediate
realities of tension-inspired situations
or conflicts. Therefore, to adequately
understand recreation as a treatment
tool, it is essential to understand the
nature and scope of psychiatric prob-
lcms as we see them within one frame
of reference.

The human organism from the mo-
ment of birth until the moment of
death is under a state of tension. The
individual reacts to this tension by
massive or at least partial withdrawal
from undesirable situations. lie re-
acts to conflicts by an emphasis on de-
pendency needs or he may react by
aggressive action in an cflort to con-
qucr the conflict-inspiring situation, or
he might withdraw completely. llis rc-
sponsc might be naive, ridiculous, or
utterly inappropriate -— c.g., running
from school for fear of being consid-
ered exhibitionistie, asking for help in
making a decision over the choice of
a necktie, or swearing vigorously at a
faulty engine. The ability to use one’s
tensions in any of these three aspects

of behaviors is indicative of one’s lua-
turity. A child expresses its need for
food by crying; this is normal depen-
dency, but a thirty-year-old adult who
needs his mother to select his next date
is expressing an immature dependency
need.

If we, as normal human beings are
to derive satisfaction from recreation,
it must furnish the same aspects, in
fun and pleasure, that we find in liv-
ing.‘ We all have constant, certain,
numerous, unswerving, aggressive
needs. Some of these are realistic and
some are not. The childish motorist
who, to satisfy his need to dominate,
dashes out ahead of trailic, is neither
realistic nor mature. Recreation then
must provide a form of socially ac-
ceptable aggressiveness. The depen-
dcncy needs of people are of tremen-
dous import and recreation must con-
tain certain forms of socially accept-
able dependency needs. Because we all
should have a bi-sexual orientation,
recreation should furnish patterns of
socially acceptable erotic responses.

It should be pointed out that not
one of us has now, nor will ever at-
tain or accomplish all the ego-ideals
we once set for ourselves as children.
We have all done things of which we

feel ashamed and wish we could relive
many areas of our lives. For this rea-
son, we all possess more or less feel-
ings of guilt which gnaw mercilessly
and needlessly at our personalities; so,
f recreation must then be an escape from
guilt. Because mankind has within
him the matrix of numerous animal
attributes, instincts which, as an adult,
he might think are repugnant, there is
always present the thin edge of fear
that we might lose control of ourselves;
in which case the irnpulses and hostile
instincts might be acted out in our im-
mediate society. Therefore, recreation
‘ should provide an opportunity for
modified release of self-control. Be-
cause of all these human attributes,
recreation must be such that it will en-
hance the self-esteem; and the activity
must be so acceptable to the individ-
ual and his group that, irrespective of
the limits, there should be no fear of
reprisal for the pleasure which follows
the relief of tension. This is why foot-
ball played in the mud is considerably
more acceptable in youth and adoles-
cence than all the glittering uniforms
the players would be able to wear if
the contest were woven around tiddly-
winks.

Therapy, irrespective of its type, that
is aimed at the disease, rather than at
the person, is invariably doomed to
failurc. In terms of using the tools of
recreation for therapy, we tend to fo-
cus on the release of tensions woven
about the patient’s problems, relative
to his maturity level. The principal
problems which afflict our patient stem
from his inability to handle emotional
maturity with satisfaction. Rather
than face reality with its normal, hu-
man limitations, he tends to retreat to
a more primitive type of emotional ex-
istence to recapture, at least in fan-
tasy, a world in which he can do and
say and feel things that once gave sat-
isfaction. This might be a partial re-
trcat to an adolescent stage, or a com-
plete retreat—to the level of a gurgling
infant.

To be effective, recreation should
then be permissive; it should enhance
creativity, by an atmosphere in which
interpersonal relationships are stressed
as a desirable goal in mental health;
it should give status without demean-
ing another’s dignity.

MARCH 1953

Recreation coordinators should be
able to provide the patient with an
awareness of himself as an individual
in society. Recreation should be de-
signed to make the patient subtly aware
that his status needs may be excessive,
or his dependency needs too painful.
Consequently, to be successful, the rec-
reational program cannot be tossed
into a ward. Careful orientation
around the diversity of cultural levels,
attitudes and values must be thor-
oughly recognized. The therapist must
possess sufficient maturity and mobil-
ity to sense the prompt changes in
mood and fugue of the patients, recog-
nize the mercurial changes in tempo
and beat, and with unity of purpose,
bring them to a harmonious whole
with only the subtlest hint that the
alteration was scientifically designed.

Recreation institutional set-
ting, such as a naval hospital, must be
grossly designed about the manifold
cultures from which our patients come.
Naval personnel represent every edu-
cational, economic and social level in
our nation. These officers and men,
therefore, are subject to the reactions,

in an

fears, worries, tensions, aggressions
and dependency needs that from time
to time afflict all humanity; and when
their reactions to these become so
great that they can no longer function
within our society, they become pa-
tients and are subsequently transferred
to the psychiatric service of a naval
hospital. Here they meet and work
with recreation coordinators who use
their skill to help them to integrate
their needs, attitudes and values to
those of American society. Psychiatric

 

patients are people who distort normal
human values attached to thoughts,
feelings, actions, cultural attainments,
and erotic needs. Again, we reiterate
that, in order to be successful, it is im-
perative that we treat the patient, not
the disease.

Within this frame, let us turn now
to the way recreation is used thera-
peutically in our institution: First of

all, we attempt to weave treatment
about the basic personality of the pa-
tient. This implies a knowledge of the
patient’s emotional maturity. Matur-
ity implies one’s ability to see himself
as an individual with respect to past
and present interpersonal relation-
ships. To reach maturity implies emo-
tional growth. We all recognize there
is considerable difference between the
strenuous competition of two wrestling
youngsters and the thoughtful discus-
sions of middle-aged men; and we ap-
preciate, too, the difference between
the varied goals of an adolescent and
those of a child.

Patients are admitted to a hospital
because, in many instances, they are
unable to stand the threat of maturity.
Because recreational activities are wo-
ven around emotional growth, it is im-
portant that we understand the stages
of maturity. There are successive
stages of development which John C.
Whitehorn so beautifully brings out in
his clinical personality studies, and we
try to use this guide in the hospital
here as an index of the activities best
suited for the patients. Once the na-
ture and scope of emotional growth is
clearly understood, it is possible to
manipulate maturity goals more rapid-
ly and with greater effectiveness
through adequate recreation. The
stages of emotional growth are in-
fancy, childhood, youth and adoles-
cence, each of these stages possessing
patterns of emotional deve10pment.
These are clearly evident to the dis-
cerning mature adult, the finished
product.

Infancy is characterized by great
oral needs. Infants are demanding; in-
tolerant to frustration, they throw
things and beg for recognition from
others. Their affectionate demands, as
we know, are tremendous. They are
quick to perceive visual and auditory
responses in others. A frown of an-
noyance can provoke tears.

A twenty-year-old male, who has re-
treated to this phase of deve10pment,
is treated as an infant. We try to give
him a great deal of solicitous atten-
tion. He is encouraged to look at pic-
ture books. We try to create a feeling
of permissiveness in ward situations
where he can throw things, if he so de-
sires. He is reached through his oral

J

needs; and the warmth of a maternal
atmosphere is recaptured by ward
waffle and candy parties. He is per-
mitted to externalize his destructive
tensions to a limited degree, by ex-
ploding paper bags, balloon-blowing
contests, and cloth-tearing as part of
simple activities.

The childish stage of emotional de-
velopment is the “why” stage familiar
to every parent. The normal child is
filled with tremendous curiosity about
his world. To him, this world is an
oyster which awaits his opening so that
he may swallow with delight. A
healthy, happy child has a great deal
of aggression. Yet, from time to time,
he quickly withdraws from unfamiliar
situations. Possessing no strong sex-
ual differentiation, it is sufficient that
the world is brilliant and colorful, cre-
ated solely to satisfy his own omnip-
otent pleasures.

Patients in this stage are exposed to
crayon coloring games and similar
means of identifying themselves with
others in situations comparable to
those experienced in childhood. As
children, they enjoyed frightening
themselves and others with grisly tales
and fearsome masks. On our wards
they make their own masks. Simple
contests, where games are based upon
their own limited awareness of thcm-
selves with respect to others, are eu-
couraged by small prizes. Because at
this stage victory is more important
than the game, the child’s prestige
needs are voracious. Motor games like
ping-pong and horseshoes are impor-
tant. Group singing, too, at this stage,
reeaptures the warmth and comfort of
a family situation. Birthdays are cele-
brated with ward parties.

The youth stage is assertive, demon-
strative, athletic. possessing strong
identification -- llopalong Cassidy
eompctes with Buck Rogers and Joe
l’alooka. Youth rccognizcs itsclf as
possessing sex but actually denies the
aims of hctcrosexuality. Recreation at
this stage is focused on the patients
who plan and lead others to participate
in games. Mechanical devices such as
record-making machincs are impor-
tant. and the normal youth begins to
apply himself to more and more com-
plcx activities. liobbics become im-
portantu-stamp-collecting and model-

586

building take on high emotional val-
ues. Youth, too, desires to know the
limits of the world, to understand or-
derly livin". Men in this particular
stage of development have ward rules
which are strict and relatively relent-
less. Social activities take on more
and more meaning. Youth sees itself
as a dramatic poseur; thus, our pa-
tients are offered dramatic activities—
they become a part of rhythm bands
and participate in ward plays. Coop-
erative enterprise develops at this stage
of living; and patients are encouraged
to form themselves into games with
teammates. Because the child tests the
rules, and at the same time tests his
own assertiveness in horse-play, these
contests of skill take on an ever in-
creasing importance. Youth also be-
gins to see itself for the first time as
part of a greater world. The good par-
ent takes his children on outings—pic-
nics, visits to various industrial plants
and museums. We attempt to repro-
duce this same relationship. Our pa-
tients are taken on picnics, barbecues,
and tours of industries, thus drawing

 

their interests from themselves to an

outside world so they can see the
meaning of functional living in our so-
ciety. It is at this stage that occupa-
tional therapy is most effective.

The the next
stage, demands tremendous indepen-
dence; possessing strong drives to
break from parental influence, he ar-
gucs for rights and privileges that are
at times frightening to parents. The
healthy adolescent varies from an
angry atheism to a lofty humanistic
idcalism. At the same time, there is a
frightening heterosexual orientation.
emphasize mercurial

normal adolescent,

appearing to
changes in mood.

Love appears for the first time as
an idcalistic theme menacing the ad
olescent dcvelopmeut, and hashfully he
turns to hooks on poetry and ruminates
over his hwn cherished one. The nor-

mal adolescent is highly antagonistic
to prohibitions; he vehemently de-
nounces parental value-s; defiantly de-
ruands the world heed his protests.
When he reluctantly recognizes the
world will not alter centuries of man-
ner and conduct to please him, he be-
comcs impatiently hostile. He hates
others with vigor and venom, for he
feels deprived of his rights.

The recreation with this
stage are really tested, for the patients
must be treated with tolerance toward
their assertiveness; they must be ac-
cepted for their mercurial
changes; they must be given greater
permissivencss for their independent
needs and at the same time be given
support and understanding if they fail
to adapt. Entertainment must be so-
cially appealing and games must have
a cooperative enterprise and strong
competitive spirit. Play in the game
isvnow more important than victory
itself—volley ball more acceptable than
ping-pong. Red Cross hostess parties
at this time are essential. Such wo-
men must be sufficiently mature to be
able to impart an air of uncalculated
spontaneity that is such an aspect of
the asexual seduction of adolescence.
lt is imperative that the patient see
himself for the first time as a member
of one sex to be oriented to that of an-
other without shame or guilt. Folk-
dancing and group singing. then. take
on a new significance. The presence of

workers

value

young women at parties also adds vig-
orous meaning to the heated arguments
about goals concerning the opposite
sex that are such a part of adolescence.
For the opposite sex must be able to
give approval, to give self-esteem.
which is infinitely more important than
is rccognizcd in our present high
schools. However. when hostility is
easier to bear. and antagonism to au-
thority more welcome than being tol-
erated by others. the patient comes to
hatc. Because hc hates society. it is
only natural for him to assume that
socicty hates him. At this stage. our
prineipal goal is to enable this patient
to recognize that he no longcr need see
himself as a hated member of society.
and to recognize. too. that there is no
nccd to hate others—if he is to accept
the rcsponsihility that accompanies
maturity without fear or venom.

Rscamrxon

In a happy childhood, there are no
antagonisms to one’s self for being
alive, nor is there hatred for others.
The child is delighted at his own feel-
ings of omnipotence and the warmth
he gets from making friends and re-
ceiving friendship and affection from
others. Unless they are carefully in-
doctrinated by parents, educators or
other frightened people, Negro and
white, Jewish and Gentile, Catholic
and Protestant children can play to-
gether with no awareness of difference
nor feeling of enmity. One of the
themes we attempt to inculcate is that
recreation can teach that the unreason-
ing enmity between adults is pathetic
and unnecessary. Progression to emo-
tional maturity carries with it the
knowledge that blame is futile and that
the dull rage in the pathologically hos-
tile individual is really a mask for a
quaking fear of failure. The mature
kindividual recognizes one desire above
all, that we accept pe0ple as they are—
even in a psychiatric institution.

One social activity that is almost uni-
versal to all mankind is that of music.

Music was man’s first interpersonal re-
lationship. The first sound we really
listened to was music, the soaring lilt
of a mother’s song. The serenade is
the wooing of adolescence. Group
singing captures the mood of earlier
and more pleasant years for our pa-
tients. Transposed and translated we
thus use this method of eXpression to
bring about healthy growth in those
who have retreated or have been ar-
rested in their developing maturity.

‘.The goal of therapy is maturity. We

try to work with our patient so that he
comes to learn that he can become an
adult, with mature goals; and that,
whether he be a ditch-digger or a sales-
man, there is no longer need to punish
himself by feeling a deSperate desire
for approbation, approval or accept-
ance. Nor does he need to rely on men-
dacious maneuvers to gain respect be-
cause he has not lived up to the goals
which he set for himself in earlier

years.
We seek to teach these men that the

geography of themselves is infinitely
more important than an impossible at-

tainment of goals based upon a cloy-
ing hunger for the respect they feel
they would receive if such goals had
been attained. A man can see himself
as a human being who has needs,
whose wishes to be admired and re-
spected do not have their origin in
some pseudo-lofty concept of accom-
plishment that has no real meaning.
They should stem from his own recog-
nition of himself as a human being.
Therefore, it is imperative that the rec-
reation worker rec0gnize that what
really counts for effective results is
that the patient be recognized for what
he is, so that in the worker there can-
not be the slightest hint of detectable
snobbery; there can be no thin shellac
of stupid or pseudo-s0phistication.
The concept of working with the pa-
tient and not for him is the aphorism
that makes for effective therapy. Goals
should be comparable to that which
the good parent tries to give his child
when he says, “We have tried to guide
and counsel you so that you can find
your goals. We have not worked for

you to find ours.”

A Novel Show Wagon

as RECREATION COMMISSION in Concord, North Carolina

has developed a show wagon which is unique. Exten-
sive inquiry convinces us that our separate unit, built on a
special ehassis and small enough to be used in almost any
situation as well as adaptable to the largest demands, is
different from anything existing today.

The city recreation commission was established in 1947,
and by mid-1951 was ready—with a large majority of
Concord citizens—to launch a full-time year-round pro-
gram. With the completion of its new quarter-million dol-
lar eenter they were in a splendid position to render real
service in public recreation, especially in the realm of in-
door activities. Soon, however, it became apparent that
indoor facilities alone were not sufficient. The crying need,
now, was for outdoor play areas which would be adequate
to serve the recreational interests of young and old of the
various neighborhoods.

Concord, like many of her sister cities, developed with-
out planning for parks, playgrounds and open play spaces.
Today, as a result, the city owns little. or no land suitable
for these purposes within the present municipal boun-
daries; consequently, the recreation commission realized
that it would have to seek unusual and drastic means to
provide the people of this far flung community with rec-
reational facilities. From this realization came the policy
and determination to use every means available in order to
develop neighborhood programs. The response to this de-
cision was quick and gratifying. Within a short time the
Locke Cotton Mill and the local Public Housing Authority
provided several cxcellent playgrounds in their neighbor-
hoods. These additions to the eity's over-all recreation fa-
cilities were, of course, a great blessing but the problem
remained-nto a grcat extent because there were so many
other neighborhoods without any play space available
whatsoever. At this stage, the recreation commission de.
cided to experiment with the show wagon idea. Of course
this idea was not new and certainly was not an invention
nor a monopoly of Concord's. However, it is not very

common and reports have it that there are not more than
eight or ten of these units in the entire United States.

Already we have had numerous inquiries about size,
eonstruction, costs, over-all use, and so on. Ours is the
experience of only one community, however, and we are
aware that there must be eountless ways of presenting this
type of program and constructing units such as these.

Nevertheless, we are sure of several important things.
Our show wagon has proved to be one of the finest public
relations and publicity mediums that we have ever experi-
enced. The very fact that it visited every neighborhood
and eould operate in streets, lawns, driveways, playgrounds
or ahnost anywhere gave us an opportunity to bring rec-
reation literally to the door steps and the back yards of our
people. We also know that this novel wagon with its gay
decorations appealed to pe0ple’s imaginations and at-
tracted them by the thousands during the course of the
summer; and for the first time, our dramatics rivaled our
athletic program in publicity and general interest. Neigh-
borhoods, which before had felt neglected and far removed
from the recreation eenter, now became a part of recrea-
tion and identified themselves with the program.

We are convinced that the small cost, which did not
greatly exceed eight hundred dollars, was one of the
finest investments that we have ever made. Certainly it
yielded one of the greatest returns in our experience. In
fact, we are so sold on this idea of “recreation on wheels”
that we are planning to eonstruct and operate a prairie
schooner type of covered wagon, as a eraft wagon for next
summer. With a simple adjustment this ean become a
“ehuck” wagon, to use as the central unit for our new
hosteling and travelling eamp program. We hope that the
following information will stimulate you into taking a
thrilling adventure along one of recreation’s new horizons.

The Production of Show anon Progrnms

1. Publicin
The Press. Newspaper publicity is most helpful. Usu-

ally the show wagon announcements appeared along with
the daily playground programs. When something special

RECREATION

was being featured, the Concord Tribune treated it as
news, with a special article about it. On several occasions
the local paper, and nearby community dailies, ran fea-
ture stories and pictures. In the larger cities there would
perhaps be morning dailies which would offer the best
medium of advertising for the show wagon evening pro-
gram.

Radio. Station WEGO in Concord was most cooperative.
We nearly always could depend upon it for either spot an-
nouncements or special mention. The dramatics depart-
ment also conducted a bi-weekly radio workshOp, and often
used this time to further advertise the show wagon.

Playground and Park Bulletin Boards. We coordinated
our show wagon program, to a very great extent, with all
of our playground activities. All shows were announced
through the medium of posters or fiyers on the playground
bulletin boards. Playground leaders announced the pro-

grams at all their gatherings, especially when the show
wagon was due in their vicinity.

2. Location of Show Wagon,

The Concord show wagon was especially designed as an
independent trailcr unit, not to exceed fourteen feet in
length, so that it could be used almost anywherc. Because
most of our neighborhoods are well built up, with few
opcn areas and almost entirely lacking in playgrounds, it
was nccessary to have a vehicle which could be parked in
narrow streets, on lawns, small vacant lots and even in
backyards. Of course, it goes without saying that if the
wagon was adaptable to these situations it could quite
easily fit into larger playground and park areas. When-
cver possible the wagon was parked at the foot of an in-
cline in the street or the lawn. This natural slope provided
an ideal surface on which to set the approximately one
hundred chairs which were carried with the wagon.

The chairs were arranged in ten rows in front of the

MARCH 1953

stage after it had been folded out from the wagon and
readied for the performance. These were seldom adequate
for the crowds that gathered but served as a stationary
core for the audience, with the overflow going to the sides
and the rear. Every effort was made to encourage young-
sters to leave the chairs for the adults and eSpecially the
older pe0ple. A roped-off area around the wagon and its
stage protected the amplifying equipment and other elec-
trical devices used in production. Much of this equipment
was kept either in the back of the jeep which tows the
wagon, or in the volunteer technician’s station wagon.

3. Lights

Electricity for the show wagon is furnished free of
charge by Concord’s light and water department. In the
early stages of show wagon planning, seven neighborhood
areas had been selected as sites for performances. This in-
formation was given to the light and water department and
they proceeded to extend wires from the electric lines down
the poles nearest to the show wagon sites. After this was
done it was a simple thing for the show wagon line to be
connected.

The show wagon lighting is very simple and consists
primarily of footlights made up of a battery of twelve col-
ored lights booked in three series and worked indepen-
dently of each other. These are seventy-five watts. Over-
head there are two one hundred and fifty-watt spotlights
mounted on long flexible arms which can slide back into
the roof of the wagon so as to be out of the way for travel-
ing. Reinforcing these extended spotlights are two one
hundred and fifty-watt white Hoodlights which are mounted
in two light weight aluminum shields with adjustable
clamps. The clamps enable these floodlights to be attached
to various parts of the show wagon so that the light can be
used to the greatest advantage wherever needed. There are
also two small fifty-watt lights over the rear doors, and
on the center rear of the stage several floor sockets which
cnable still further lighting on the stage when necessary.

 

Stage folds out from the front and is ready for use. Chairs
are arranged in ten rows, and serve as core for audience.

The switches which control all of this are found in a panel
on the lower front rear of the wagon, readily accessible
to the stagc technician and yet almost completely removed
from the sight of the audience.

We run off of one hundred and ten-volt a.c. and find that
wc must be very careful not to set up too far from the
source of our electrical supply. Any connection in excess
of fifty feet will cause a voltage drop and subsequent loss

589

of sound and light. Therefore it is imperative to keep the
wagon close to the original connection.

4. Sound

Not having a special sound truck, we have had to rely
Upon several of our public address systems. As can be ex-
pected, there were times when none of these were as satis-
factory as they might be. Our best results were achieved
by placing one large horn on the t0p of the show wagon.
Actually, for perfection, several different types of mikes
should be used, and in the case of a dramatic production
at least two mikes should be used on the stage. A ceiling
mike for all purposes would be better than the standard
pedestal inike becausc of the necessity of moving the mike
back and forth to meet the various requirements of differ-
ent acts. In any case the average sound system, properly
conditioned and operated, will satisfactorily serve the
usual neighborhood, crowd. It is only when the crowd
exceeds four or five hundred, and is spread out over a
larger area, that special attention should be given to the
production of better sound.

5. Pre-Show Time

We find that despite good publicity it is necessary to
play rccords to attract people, and to entertain the waiting
audiencc before show time. Good marches, popular num-
bers, circus music tend to reduce audience restlessness.
Experience has shown us that every effort must be made to
have the wagon set up and ready to go at least half an hour
before show time. This leeway may not be enough during
the first sevcral performances, and we cannot emphasize
its importance too strongly. Until the show wagon crew
bccomes experienced and adcpt in setting up the “Big
Top” there will be many delays, hitches and failures which

will consume time and unless allowed for will hinder the
show.

6. Location of Shows and Auditions

Before the season began, seven locations in seven dif-
ferent neighborhoods were selected. In almost every case
these were not close to existing playground facilities. Au-
ditions were held by the dramatic department on the play-
grounds, or in the neighborhood schools which are used as
dramatic centers during the summer. f’ersonncl were re-
cruited and tested in this manner and eventually organ-
izcd into four separate shows.

When streets were used as locations, production permis-
sion was always securcd from the police department, and
the streets were barricaded at each end. The barricades
carried an explanatory sign; and flares were used on
either side as a safety precaution. Needless to say there
was not one traffic accident, nor any other mishap, in con-
nection with the show wagon performances.

7. Scheduler! Performances

Each show ran for two weeks in which time all seven
of the areas were covered unless inclement weather caused

a cancellation. While one show was in progress the next
was being worked on by the dramatics dcpartntent during

the afternoons. In this manner One followed another with-
out any break in the program.

590

8. Special Shows and Performances

The popularity of the show wagon developed to such an
extent that several special shows had to be held in other
sections of the city. Likewise, the show wagon paid visits
to several of our playgrounds as part of their special ac-
tivities. On several occasions the stage served as a plat-
form for orchestras, Special ceremonies and other public
affairs. Since summer, the show wagon has been in at
least one community parade and probably will be in others
as well as see possible use as an advertising medium for
Little Theatre productions.

9. Season’s Finale

This year the summer recreation program finale, or
round-up, had a circus theme and the show wagon served
as the center “ring” for the Concord Community Circus.
The wagon fitted beautifully into this situation and served
as a foundation upon which the entire three-ring circus
was developed. Much of the talent uncovered by the show
wagon activities during the summer took part. Over five
thousand people witnessed the pageant and more than a
dozen community organizations entered booths on the
circus midway.

As this was our first experience with show wagon work
we realize that we don’t know all the answers and have
much to learn. To date we have held four different typcs
of shows: a musical variety show with “A Vacation Across
the Nation” as the theme; a one-act comedy; puppet show;
playground talent show.

There are a number of other forms of entertainment
which would fit in very well with the wagon. We hope to
use it in another season for a series of street dances cou-
pled with outdoor movies. Our Little Theatre is hoping to
use it at least once for an outdoor production during the
coming summer. Several local private dancing schools are
also contemplating borrowing it for outdoor entcrtainmcnts
in the neighborhoods in which they are located. Of course
this is only scratching the surface, and as time goes along
we are sure there will be many more uses and adaptions
available.

Madison, Wisconsin

( HE STAGECOACH, or travel theatre, is used as part of the
ll summer playground program in Madison. A jeep truck
carries a cast of from twelve to fifteen boys and girls and
furnishes the power to pull the Stagecoach to the various
playgrounds where plays are put on.

It was built in one of the high school machine shops
from a farm wagon, with a flat bed seven by fourteen feet,
equipped with a trailer hitch and mounted on automobile
tires. When it is opened up it makes a stage approximately
fourteen feet square.

The work was done by teachers and boys enrolled in the
machine sh0p class. The wagon itself cost about $350 and
approximately $1,000 was used for supplies and equipment
to complete the job. The only other cost is thc salary of
a man to drive the truck and take charge of setting it up
and taking it down at each performance. The directors of
the playgrounds assist with this operation after it arrives
at the playground; and it takes about ten minutes to put
it up and the same amount of time to take it down.

The boys and girls who make up the cast are of junior
and senior ages and are part of another summer program,
namely, Summer Youth Theatre. There is a director in

charge, and the Stagecoach and its activities are part of
this summer theatre.

Omaha, Nebraska

A mobile stage unit for the presentation of outdoor tal-
ent shows was presented to the children of Omaha by thc
World-Herald Good Fellows Charities, Incorporated. The
interest of the W arid-Herald was aroused by the “Play-
ground Follies” which were put on at the end of cach play-
ground season with a cast composed of the best talent se-
lected from each. Formerly these shows were put on with
just a platform, lights and a public address system. They
werc so popular that the paper readily saw the need for

MARCH 1953

such a vehicle and also recognized the good will that could
be created by such a gift to the children. The name, Show
Wagon, was selected through a contest; and the vehicle
was turned over to the park and recreation department
which agreed to maintain and operate it.

The Show Wagon, which cost in excess of $4,000, is
complete in every detail. It is arranged so that one side of
what would normally be a van, fifteen feet long and seven
feet wide, drops down and becomes a part of the stage.
The wagon is mounted on a four-wheel trailer unit which
can be fastened to the back of an ordinary truck and
moved from playground to playground. It is equipped with
its own sound system, a piano and a 5,000 watt generator
for use when regular power is not available. There are
electrical outlets at strategic locations in the walls and
floor for foot lights. The unit is available to community
organizations who book it for specific dates.

Norfolk, Virginia

A Traveling Marionette Show, which presented half-hour
performances, was one of Norfolk’s most popular summer
playground attractions last year. A maintenance truck was
used to transport the equipment, which included the stage,
organ, and portable address system, and also served as the
base for the stage during the show.

The stage was designed by the arts and crafts supervisor
and constructed from a portion of an old ping pong table
with folding legs. The colorful lime backdrOp and rose
draw-curtains were made of monk’s cloth. Scrap materials
mostly were used for the marionettes and scenery which
were made during the winter at one of the community
centers.

The show was well-received by the many audiences who
sat on the ground under shade trees during the perform-
ances; and it served as an inspiration to other centers
which are now planning their own traveling puppet shows.

ACROSS -T HE - BORDER

Sixes THE revival of popular interest

in square dancing, many large fes-
tivals and jamborees have been held in
cities throughout the United States.
Houston, St. Louis, Omaha, Chicago,
and a number of California cities,
~ have all been host to spectacular
events—with dozens of star callers and
hundreds of participating clubs and
groups.

This surge of square dance enthusi-
asm has not been limited to the
United States, however. Following the
visit of then-Princess Elizabeth to this
country, and the many published pho-
tographs of her square dancing, there
has been a definite square dance craze
in Great Britain. For a number of
years, American occupation forces in
Japan have been square dancing, with
the result that many Japanese are now
swinging their partners and doing the
do-si-do! Down under, New Zealand-
ers have caught on too.

To the north, in the provinces of
western Canada, there has been a com-
parable amount of sqnare dance aetiv-
ity, probably influenced by the enthu-
siasm in Washington and Oregon. But,
strangely, there has been very little
outward display of interest in this
form of recreation in eastern Canada.
particularly in the p0pulous Quebec
Province. While a number of groups
have existed there for years, most of
these have danced to records and in
small numbers. Little eo-edueational

none at all in the French, according to
J. C. Lang, director of physical edu-
for boys in the Protestant
schools of that city.

So, in June, 1951, when Dr. Stew-
art Davidson returned to Montreal
from Teachers College, Columbia Uni-
versity, where he had obtained his doc-
tor’s degree in the field of physical
education, he found considerable curi-
osity about square dancing in the

These classes, sponsored by the Great
er Montreal Branch of the Canadian
Association for Health, Physical Edu-
cation and Recreation, were held in
the Montreal schools, and were ex-
tremely well attended.

Emphasizing group learning tech-
niques, he found tremendous interest
displayed by teachers and recreation
leaders. And, when the series came to
a close, everyone was saying, "Let‘s
run a festival!”

Organizing To Do The Job

As they have for many groups that
have tackled the same assignment in
the United States, a number of vital
questions immediately presented them-
selves to the Canadians:

Should the event be by invitation, or
open to the public?

What size attendance may reason-

Shall participation be the keynote,

A group of physical educators and
recreation leaders handed to-
gether to solve these problems. Dr.
J. B. Kirkpatrick and Miss Winona

ous recreation organizations that were
represented on the planning committee
cooperated in the advance ticket sale.
Both local and national radio stations
agreed to record the festival on tape, and
then to re-broadcast it. Throughout,
Montreal newspapers carried articles
and releases prepared by the publicity
committee, including pictures and fea-
ture articles prepared by staff writers
assigned to the festival and workshop.
The possibilities of television and film-
ing were also explored, but technical
difficulties prevented them from being
carried out.

At the same time, when Flying Of-
ficer Frank Lynch, active in Canadian
armed forces recreation and a class-
mate of Stewart Davidson’s, heard of
the festival, he determined to make use
of it. Plans were quickly laid to fly in
uniformed men and women from out-
lying posts to attend both the festival
and the leaders’ workshop. Their pur-
pose? To gather new materials and
ideas, in the area of square dancing,
which they might use as a supplement
to the athletic programs already estab-
lished for all ranks at their stations.

Setting Up The Program

Meanwhile, the planning committee
found that a number of square dance
groups, which had been meeting for
years, knew little about other such
clubs in the vicinity. Many of them
expressed astonishment: “Why we
thought we were the only ones square
dancing in Montreal!”

Under the direction of J. G. Lang,
who was to serve as master of cere-
monies for the evening program, a
number of these groups prepared dem-
onstrations. They included one young
French folk dance group, led by Si-
moue Voyer. Lang also arranged to
have a number of the local callers on
the program, and for a band to play
through the evening, featuring Jean
Corrigan, champion French Canadian
fiddler. In addition, the author of this
article was flown up from New York,
to act as featured guest caller at the
festival and to conduct the leaders’
workshOp the next morning.

Bob Wilkinson and Howard Ryan,
faculty members of the McGill School
of Physical Education, were placed in
charge of facilities. Certain problems

MARCH 1953

arose here. The question of concession
rights was not fully explored by the
committee, resulting in loss of revenue
from refreshments. Exemption from
the amusement tax was not applied
for early enough, resulting in another
loss. There was disagreement among
committee members concerning the
displays that were to be put up, as well
as other responsibilities. But, by and
large, they worked together extremely
well through the weeks preceding the
festival.

The Big Event

Friday, November 14, turned out to
be a dark and rainy day—a gloomy
on1en! Committee members gathered
early in the Sir Arthur Currie Me-
morial Gymnasium at McCill. The
huge hall, vaster than most armories
and with an excellent floor for danc-
ing, had been gaily decorated. The
bandstand was garlanded and bedecked
with corn shucks, pumpkins and cos-
tumed dummies as ornaments. A huge
painted sign with details of the pro-
gram towered over the stand. Acous-
tics, arranged by the local radio sta-
tion’s technician, were fine. At one
end of the floor, empty rows of bleach-
ers waited.

Eight o’clock, the announced begin-
ning time, came and went! Only a
few people were scattered about the
sides of the hall. How many would
attend? Many people had worked
long and hard on this event, the first of
its kind in eastern Canada’s recreation
history. For it to prove a dud—a
flop—would be heartbreaking.

Then the dancers began to swarm
in; some of them dressed in their Sun-
day best, others in plaid shirts and
dungarees. They came in couples, sets
and clubs. Most were English speak-
ing, but there were a number of French
Canadians too. And, as the callers
strutted their stuff, as the demonstra-
tion groups performed, they kept com-
ing. Newspaper and magazine writers
scurried around, taking notes. Photo-
graphers and radio technicians clogged
the steps to the bandstand . . . .

At the high point of the evening,
the attendance was estimated at be-
tween 1,200 and 1,400, far exceeding
all expectations!

From a dancing point of view, the

program proved not too different from
what might be seen south of the bor-
der. Most of the dances were fairly
simple; many were like traditional
New England and Midwestern figures.
The majority were called, patter-style,
rather than sung. The style of the
dancers was not highly polished; most
of them skipped throughout the eve-
ning and swung wildly. No folk dances
or mixers were presented, except those
taught by the author. Interestingly
enough, three of the younger callers
presented dances similar to those from
the American Southwest, both in call-
ing style and the pattern of the move-
ments. With the exception of one
caller, who had visited the United
States recently, they had learned this
material from books and records.

Next morning over 150 school teach-
ers, recreation workers and callers at-
tended the leaders’ workshop. On the
crest of enthusiasm engendered by the
success of the festival, they voted unan-
imously to form a Square Dance As-
sociation, to carry on the work that
had been begun and help spread square
dancing throughout Quebec Province
and beyond.

Summing Up

In reviewing the week-end, Dr. Da-
vidson, who is at present Director of
Physical Education at Strathcona
Academy, Outremont, Quebec, says:

“I feel that our strength lay in the
excellent publicity we received, at no
cost, . . . The weaknesses lay in the
acceptance of responsibilities by indi-
viduals who were already overbur-
dened with work and were unable to
fulfill the additional tasks imposed by
the festival. . . .”

He adds, “As a whole, though, the
experience was a tremendous one for
us. The radio station, for instance, re-
ceived so many favorable comments
about their broadcast of the festival
that they want to air a regular square
dance program weekly. Many people
came in from distant communities to
find out how to build square dancing
in their areas; other people are eager
to know about future callers’ courses.
The schools are planning to introduce
much more of it on a co-educational
basis. Square dancing is on its way
in Eastern Canada!”

Recreation leaders who believe in
the fellowship values at one time in-
herent in the folk and square dance
are deeply concerned with the present
situation. The latest expressions of
this concern may be found in such ar-
ticles as Ed Durlaeher’s “Quo Vadis,”
reprinted in The Midwest Dancer for
September 1952, in surveys like Don
Armstrong’s “Let’s Pause for Refresh-
ment,” in American Squares for Oc-

Pappy Shaw’s “Let’s relax and dance
for fun and not for the Joneses.” Dur-
laeher points out how the craze for in-
tricacy—thc rash of twistcrs and mazes

dance. Armstrong notes with alarm
the lack of mixers which he says, in a
previous article,” seems prevalent in
the western states.

Don Armstrong and others, are signs
of the snob times. The inevitable ra-

tionalizations have come up to explain
away the trend, and they would be
amusing were it not for their deadly
effect on sociability.

Two stock arguments against mixers
were repeated in effect in a letter in
American Squares for November 1952:
(1) We stay by ourselves for protec-
tion; (2) We don’t want to get stuck
with somebody all evening. Now,
there may be occasional situations
where these reasons are genuine, and
we are granting the sincerity of the
letter writer, but in the overwhelming
majority of cases these excuses are
merely rationalizations for snobbish-
ncss. Let us briefly examine them.

Regarding the “protection” refrain,
if a dance is rough, there is no protec-
tion staying in one’s own set. One will
get jostled, stepped on, or kicked by
dancers in one’s own or adjacent sets.
More, the horscplay will send other
dancers eareening into one another’s
sets. The immediate solution is to go
home and not come back again.

It is, however, in the square dance
clubs, where all are supposed to be
friends and skilled dancers, that the
most extreme cxclusiveness is prac-
ticcd. In some clubs, dancers not only
stay in their original sets, but dance
on the same spot on the floor, and not
one mixer is danced all evening.

The “get stuck” argument has even
less ground to stand on. In the first
place, no mixer lasts all night, but
usually only a few minutes. One
changes partners continually in a
mixer.

It is a great pleasure, of course, for

SQUARE DANCING

a skilled dancer to dance with another
skilled dancer, especially a good
friend, or in a set of skilled dancers.
It is also a great pleasure to share
onc’s skills with those less skilled—to
help others acquire these skills and en-
joy them too. Pleasure, then, is
spread. More and more people share
the joy of life to be found in the folk
and square dance. It is a form of so-
cial generosity to mix with others, and
to help them get the exhilarating lift
out of the folk dance that we have
learned to get. On the other hand, it is
sheer selfishness to stay with one part-
ner or in one set.

Dancing that is shared in a helpful
manner becomes a good-neighbor ac-
tivity, a mutual enjoyment of fun, and
the folk dance is carried on, as it
should be, as a recreational means to
a fellowship end. That is its original
and true function. Sociability comes
first, then dancing skill. The very word
[0”: means “of the people.”

Ideally, to be sure, sociability and
skill go together. Skilled dancers in a
balanced program have both. Theirs is
the joy of a shared art, a truly folk
art. And by giving of their skill to
others, the level of dancing is raised
for all in a sociable manner. Even
granting the protection argument for
a moment, dancers would protect them-
selves by teaching others.

It seems that a balanced program
would he fifty per cent mixers. One
dances with his partner, and in his set
if he wishes, half the time, and with
others half the time. Of course, indi-
viduals and sets may mix more often

if they want, in the scheduled or di-
rected program. In this way one en-
joys himself with his neighbors, makes
new friends, discovers compatible part-
ners.

For to be “out of the world,” to be
“in the groove,” as our jazz devotees
would say, is a glorious release for
troubled and untroubled souls. The re-
lease is happiest when it is shared.
The folk and square dance is a most
exhilarating means to this social re-
lease. It is a gladsome example of that
great humanitarian principle—one
finds himself by losing himself.

While the snobbery and intricacy
now evident in the American folk and
square dance are symptoms of a
shoddy, competitive commercialism
that plagues this day and age, square
dance callers—and from now on I am
referring mainly to so-called western
callers—must bear a substantial sharc
of the responsibility for it. Too many
string along with the tide, making ex-
cuses that they must keep up with the
timcs, that they will lose their crowds
if they buck the trend, that they must
give the public what it wants, and so
on. This is the language of advertising
promoters, not recreation leaders.
Thus callers, who fancy themselves
recreation leaders, by their own un-
witting admission, are ruining social
recreation.

An interesting rationalization used
by callers is that mixers are too much
extra work. Calling squares, they say,
is in itself plenty for a night’s stand.
This excuse is absurd, for mixers by
their very nature are relaxing for both

MARCH 1953

dancers and leader. If callers choose
to shirk their social duties, they should
quit the business.

By following the frantic fads of the
day, callers and dance instructors aid
and abet them. Worse, they become a
means of instigating them.

The trend is so insidious that in
some quarters it is taken for granted.
Callers pooh-pooh the cries of critics
as alarmist or exaggerated, and at the
same time cannot see what is happen-
ing under their own noses. Like the
case of the caller who spent a discus-
sion period preaching simplicity and
then proceeded to teach complicated
square dance figures usable only for
exhibition sets.

to note that the merry old mixer, the
Circle Two-Step or Paul Jones, prob-
ably the best get-acquainted mixer of
all, is treated with blasé scorn in the
urban areas of the West. But not so in

western hash calls, that the frantic
changes allow no time for becoming
acquainted.

Now we can understand the why of
the tremendous turnover in the mem-
bership of square dance clubs that Don
Armstrong writes about. We can un-

Wan: THE PEOPLE of a commu-
nity, of a state, of a nation, or
of many nations meet together in one
place to celebrate with their own na-
tive songs and dances in the spirit of
pride and enjoyment, we have all the
good makings of a folk festival. In in-
formal ways, they can be said to occur
in the lifc of every town—those times
when you and your neighbors get to-
gcther for an evening of singing the
old songs, dancing the old dances. But
usually these “community sings” and
“socials” are alike, one with the other,
in that the same favoritcs make up the
cvcning. lt is when you sing or play
the music (almost always unwritten,
having been handed down generation
to generation) and perform the dances
that are native to your community, or
have been brought into it. that a true
festival is begun.

Why a Community Festival?

From the number of reasons why it
is worth while for a community to hold
a festival, perhaps the best is that it
fosters a new respect in the town,
neighbor for neighbor. A fair may
show the rest of the eounty what ex-
cellent farmers live therc. A commer-
cial exhibition may show how keen
and forward are the businessmen. But
a folk festival brings all together. lt
is the expression of a community—-
expression of the people through song
and dance and what we shall call plain
native spirit. Nothing reaches more
directly to the roots of a people than
their songs, music, dances, legends and
art of all kinds.

Planning the Folk Festival

Let us say that the idea of a folk
festival has been suggested in your
community, discussed, accepted. You
are ready to go ahead with your plans.
It is, of course, to be an important
event and it is to be particularly your
community’s own.

At the outset it is far preferable to
start in a small way with a few dances
and songs rather than to reach for the
moon. You might be limited in your
selection of talent. Plan a festival so
it will reflect plainly the spirit of your
own townspeople, their lives, cultures
and traditions.

SELECTING A CHAIRMAN AND COM-
MITTEE—There is no need to form a
large, cumbersome organization for
the presentation of a community festi-
val; but it does need leadership. A
requisite for a successful festival is the
proper choice of a general chairman.

He should understand the eommw
nity. Since the chairman is to be the
guiding Spirit of this and future fcs-
tivals, he should also he familiar with
the purpose of such festivals. The gen-
eral chairman will have the responsi-
bility of staging the presentation, seek-
ing and selecting the participants, ar-
ranging and supervising all details. lt
goes almost without saying that he
must have the respect of tch commu-
nity. Necessary, too, is the ability to
bring many typcs of people together—
and to keep them tOgethcr in harmony.
The chairman is the leader; but it’s a
job for a diplomat, not for a high-
pressure dictator who engenders ill-
feeling in a project meant to create
good will among all.

if the program is an amhitions one,
the chairman can appoint separate
leaders or committees. lndividuals or

 

committees can be selected to look
after business and program details.
Others may be made responsible for
auditorium arrangements, ticket sale
and publicity. Each division of the
program can be put in charge of one
person best acquainted with the par-
ticular typc of folk expression repre-
sented: a person who is active in
square dancing would be the proper
one to interest other dancers, a fiddler
to enlist other fiddlers, and so on.

It should be the business of the gen-
eral chairman to coordinate the efforts
of all. To do this, meetings of the
leaders are necessary. The number of
meetings depends upon the special
problems found in your community. A
good plan is to have at least one gen-
eral meeting held early so that each
divisional leader will get the general
picture, and another one just before
the festival for final instructions.

THE BUDGET AND SPoxsoas—One of
the reasons that the community festival
is a logical activity is because it can
be both recreational and inexpensive.
lndccd most small festivals are held
with little or no expense. If the audi-
toriuln or open-air theater is made free
to the festival, and no admission is
charged, no tickets or programs print-
ed, there is no reason for great ex-
pensc, sinee these are the only large
items to be taken into consideration.
Participants should not be paid. Those
who play a part should do so with a
feeling that they are making a contri-
bution which is of value to them.

lf your festival is to involve expense,
the chairman makes out a budget. The
next step is to get some responsible
individual or group to guarantee such
a budget heforc plans are begun. lt
should be understood beforehand ex-

RECREATtON

actly what financial arrangements are
necessary. When a sponsor guarantees
funds and expects to be repaid after
the ticket sale, every effort is then
necessary to see that repayment is
made.

It is suggested that wherever pos-
sible responsible sponsorship be se-
cured, even when there is little or no
expense connected with the festival. A
sponsoring committee might be ob»
tained from educational institutions,
civic organizations, newspapers, busi—
ness groups or local chamber of com-
merce. Another suggestion is to add
as well a citizens’ sponsoring commit-
tee.

THE PLACE AND THE TIME-*Spring
has always been a natural festival time.
The date you choose, however, might
be one which is already established as
a time of importance in your area.
This might be during the harvest sea-
son; it might be the date of the found-
ing of the town. Fourth of July,
Thanksgiving, or any national or local
holiday celebration could well be your
festival time.

Most towns and village festivals are
contained in one performance an hour
or more in length. Larger city and
community performances (usually
after several years of development)
often are spaced over two, three or
more days, with programs given in the
afternoon and evening.

TICKETS—Many of the community
festivals are given without charge. If
possible, they should be.

When it is necessary to make a
charge because of expenses involved,
the price of the admission should be
nominal. After all, money-making is
not the objective of a folk festival—nor
should it be.

If there is a ticket sale, it should be
started several weeks before the festi-
val date. When a considerable number
of tickets are to be sold, a ticket com-
mittee may be appointed to include a
representative of each group in the
program.

PUBLICITY—A folk festival is worth
telling people about. The more ambi-
tious program may have a publicity di-
rector appointed to do most of the

telling. Such a director would make
available to the press all details of in-
terest concerning the festival, its pro-

MARCH 1953

gram and participants. He may be
called upon to explain the significance
back of each individual presentation as
well as how each single part of the
program fits into the folk story of the
community.

For practical help in preparing news-
stories, your local newspaper editor
is the best person to consult. The first
publicity release prepared for a large
community festival is usually general
in tone, stressing the objectives and
scope of the program. “Follow” stor-
ies may then deal with the individual
groups, including background history.
Such stories can be prepared not only
with the idea of drawing an audience,
but of explaining and interpreting the
festival, and to help find those who
might have a contribution to make to
the program.

Such stories go to the leading news-
papers, but don’t overlook smaller pub-
lications, especially those of different
language groups if they happen to ex-
ist in your community. It is often
practical for the publicity director to
have a committee made up of a person
from each division of the program.
The leaders in the separate divisions
have the contacts necessary to reach
their own people directly.

In addition to newspaper releases,
consideration may be given to radio
programs and talks before civic and
educational groups of all kinds. Stores
may cooperate by special window dis-
plays. All such activities are under
the supervision of the publicity direc-
tor.

ABOUT THE LAW—If there is a pub-
lic ticket sale, remember to check with
your local authorities on the tax laws—
the Collector of Internal Revenue on
the federal admissions tax and local of-
ficials as to other such taxes as may be
imposed. If your festival is to be pre-
sentcd in a hall or theater, it may be
necessary to get special entertainment
permits or to meet other legal con-
siderations under your local laws.
It is best to have someone investigate
early and thus save a possible head-
ache at the last minute—such as having
the fire marshal declare you have dis-
regarded the maximum seating ca-
pacity of a certain auditorium.

USIIERS—Again if your planned fes-
tival is to be a sizeable one with a

large audience, a member of the com-
mittee should be given the responsi-
bility of arranging the seating so that
there will be a minimum of confusion
when the audience arrives. In audi-
oriums with. established seating ar-
rangements and a regular staff of ush-
ers, this is a passing matter. Where
special seating arrangements are made,
as at an outdoor festival, this becomes
quite another matter. Seats and rows
should be clearly marked, and ushers
who understand the arrangement
should be detailed to guide the audi-
ence.

PROGRAM NOTES—A worthy sou-
venir of a memorable festival is the
printed program. If possible, notes
should be prepared as an explanatory
background to the music, songs, dances
and other presentations.

Building a Program

As pointed out earlier, the customs,
talent and folklore of your community
are to give your festival a character
of its own. No one comprehensive
sample program will serve for any one
locality, since the character of the tal-
ent will be different in each commu-
nity.

To build a program, study the types
of folk representation and find out
about the talent available in your sur-
roundings. Then you are ready to ar-
range to have such individuals and
groups prepared for the festival date.

TALENT HUNT—In smaller commu-
nities where nearly everyone knews his
neighbor, you will be able to plan' a
program without searching very far,
for your festival probably is to be an
economical one of very informal na-
ture. In larger towns and cities, a tal-
ent hunt poseS‘more of a problem. Be-
come familiar with all the groups in
your area which might be represented.
Walk and talk festival. Go to the edi-
tors of newspapers, to oldsters in the
community whose memories may put
you on the track of valuable festival
material. Schools, too, should be in-
cluded in the search for talent. News-
paper publicity may also aid in locat-
ing individuals and groups who should
be represented.

Do make it a point that, wherever
there are different types of grouPs
available, all are given the opportunity

597

to take part.

FOLK MUSIC—The general plan puts
folk music into two divisions:

l. The rendering of original folk
music performed by individuals or by
a group, vocal or instrumental or ac-
companied, to include the songs and
music of the Indians, early settlers and
later arrivals, as well as the fascinating
lore found in sea chanteys, river,
canal, lumberjack, mining and cow-
boy songs, Negro spirituals and work
songs. In these presentations, appro-
priate instruments such as the fiddle,
duleimer, banjo, guitar, harmonica and
aecordion should be used.

2. The presentation of arranged
compositions—choral or instrumental
—based on original folk music but
which are adaptions or departures
from the original form.

FOLK DANCES—Folk dancing is one
of the most popular, colorful and in-
teresting phases of a festival, giving it
action and vitality. The general plan
also creates two divisions here:

1. Characteristic dances which have
been handed down in their traditional
forms. Again the accent should be on
authenticity. Among the forms includ-
ed are Indian dances, square dances,
singing games, English, Scottish, Irish,
Spanish-American, French and other
dances performed in early days. And
we have the Russian, Italian, Czecho-
slovakian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Chi-
nese, Filipino and other dances more
recent to America.

2. The presentation of dances devel-
oped from the above basic forms.

FOLK PLAYS—Traditional folk plays
or those recently written, utilizing folk
materials, may be presented when it is
possible to fit them into the program.
If such a play is available—short in
form and common to your locality—it
would be interesting to include it, as
this is rather a rare festival event in
most communities.

Ornea FEATURES—Two other fea-
tures appropriate to a program are
handicraft exhibits and the recounting
of local legends, folk tales and super-

stitions.

The handicra/t exhibit displays craft
creations of the groups represented on
the festival program or found in the
community. This includes sculpture,
wood and metal work, woven blankets,

$98

quilts, rugs, bead-work, pottery, wood-
carving, paintings dealing with folk
themes, and other arts and crafts of
the folk. This is arranged as a sepa-
rate part of the festival, the display
adding much to the “atmosphere” of
the stage presentations. Demonstra-
tions of weaving, spinning, pottery-
making and other creative efforts also
may be included.

The legends, [elk tales and supersti-
tions are something “different” when
part of a program and, like folk plays,
should be common to your locality.

Know your community—learn about

it—and then build your program.

Presentation

GROUP REHEARSALS — After the
chairman knows what is to be included
on the program, attention can be given
to the actual presentation. If the pro-
gram includes a variety of groups, now
is the time to plan their efforts so that
there will not be too many songs to-
gether, or too many dances following
each other. The longer the program,
the greater the need for attention to
variety. Consider your audience and
prepare for them by planning as
smooth-running a festival as you can.

Timing is another important consid-
cration when the program is to extend
for an hour or more. It is hard for
some groups to realize that if the pro-
grams are continued all through the
afternoon or evening, the audience
grows tired. If your program is to run
more than an hour, a definite time lim-
it should be given to each group or
individual early so that the various
parts of the program can be fitted eor-
rectly within the performance sched-
ule. This is difficult to do unless all
groups eooperate by rehearsing to the
time allotted in advance. If one or
two participating groups take too much
time, the whole program is thrown out
of balance.

COSTUMES—In presentations where
special costumes are used, leaders
should see that they are either originals
or faithful reproductions.

SCENERY—Little scenery is neces-
sary. A single background of a neu-
tral nature will suffice. It is not cus-
tornary to mount folk festivals with
elaborate stage sets or to present each
folk group with a special effect. The

stage is most simply planned so as to
present, through one setting, a sur-
rounding which will complement all
types of groups.

DRESS REIIEARSAL—If possible, a
full dress rehearsal of the festival pro-
gram should be held shortly before the
actual performance. This will give the
director a golden opportunity to
smooth the timing of all the various
groups, to acquaint all the participants
at first hand with their part in the pro-
ceedings and with the stage arrange-
ments.

0N STAGE—When perhaps a dozen
or more groups participate, a smooth-
er presentation is assured if a stage
manager is behind the scenes with a
production schedule in hand to see
that the proper group takes the stage
at the proper time—~and with the right
properties.

In many festivals, one group follows
another to the stage platform or floor
where the performances are to be
given. Another method is to have all
the participants brought together and
seated on the stage before the program
begins. They are seated on chairs in
rows arranged on “riser” strips so that
a background of festival folk is on
view during the whole program. Un-
less there is a space limitation, this
latter method seems to offer the best
plan. Time is saved because partici-
pants are near the place where they are
to perform and each one does not have
to make a separate entrance. In this
way, all participants are a part of the
program all during the performances,
which adds both color and order.

THE FESTIVAL IS Obi—Your audi-
enee is seated. 0n the stage, or wait-
ing in the wings off the platform, your
folk musicians, singers and dancers are
ready. Backstage assistants stand by
their jobs. This is a moment for which
many people have been working dur-
ing weeks of time. Yet this moment is
not a tense one, as it is before the cur-
tain goes up on a new play. For this
is a festive occasion. It is a moment
for the people to make merry, to dance

and sing their songs as their fathers
did and their forefathers before them.

Here in our free country is again be-
ing played our part as preservers and
guardians of the traditional heritagcs
of many lands.

RECREATION

The outdoor stage depicts an
authentic Arabian castle with
its domed roofs and minarets.

A Spring Festival
The Caliph, in all his Splendor,

looked out over the crowd milling be-
fore him. This is where he belonged.
These were his pe0ple. He thought of
the great desert with her heat and sand
dunes; her date trees with their tall
pillar-like trunks, t0pped with graceful
fronds which brought forth such names
as Mecca, Caleb and the Garden of
Allah. It seemed to the settlers and
visitors that some magic carpet had
whisked them half-way around the
world into a bit of oriental East, for
this was not Arabia, but the little des-
ert town of lndio, California.

His thoughts flashed back to the be-
ginning of date culture in America,
nearly fifty years ago, when the De-
partment of Agriculture imported trees
from North Africa, Persia and Arabia.
Since it was ideally suited, an experi-
mental station and date garden was es-
tablished in Mecca. The dates thrived
and the first festival was held in 1922.
Today there are several thousand acres
in dates, and Choachella Valley has
become the date raising center of
America.

The crowd before the Caliph was
swelling. Men, women and children
dressed in Arabian costumes of blue,
yellow, red, green and gold mingled
with those in regular attire. Many had
taken their seats—entire families from
the baby in arms to grandmother and
cven great-grandfather. Some pushed
through carrying handfuls of pungent
smelling hot dogs. The barkers from
the booths along the midway called
out thcir wares, pigs squealed and
cows mooed from their headquarters
whcre they were bedded for the night,
because this was the Riverside County
Fair and Date Festival.

Thousands of people waited for thc
Arabian Nights Pageant to begin,

jammed the seats and overflowed onto
the lawn. The fabulous outdoor stage
depicted an authentic Arabian castle
and the street before it. According to
Moslem tradition, the minarets denote
the portion occupied by the Caliph,
while the domed roof identifies the
servants quarters. Flanking the stage
was a realistic Arabian market scene.

The pageant was an outgrowth of
something that had been trying to ex-
press itself since the valley was first
settled and the date trees planted. The
Caliph recalled the first pageant held
in 1948—of how they worked to
arouse interest through an extensive
publicity program. Each issue of the
newspapers carried write-ups on activi-
ties of the various committees and their
needs. Talks were made before clubs
and other gatherings. Personal ap-
peals were made in the high school for
boys and girls to come to the tryouts.
It was advertised extensively that here
was an excellent Opportunity to receive
expert instruction from the talented
dance director. The idea finally took

hold and it has become something for
the high school students, as well as
older people, to vie for.

Every year, stories are written on
some tale of the “One Hundred and
One Nights” and submitted to the lo-
cal pageant committee in August. Each
one must have a Caliph, a genie and
a magic lamp. These are the basic ele-
ments around which the story must be
built—a simple story where right al-
ways prevails. With beautiful costum-
ing and exotic lighting they weave a
spell that takes everyone back to the
days when he dreamed of being a
prince and rescuing the lady of his
heart. That is where the fascination of
this pageant lies. It is the reason why
many pe0ple find themselves weeping
and cannot tell why.

The story chosen by the committee
is broken into scenes, the pantomime
worked out, and suitable music written
and selected by the dance and music
directors. The cast, soloist and dancers
are chosen from the tryouts that take
place in October. The dance rehearsals

599

begin in November. Combined re-
hearsals are commenced some lime late
in January and the pageant is present-
ed in February.

The costumes are designed by local
artists and are made in the sewing
rooms at the rear of the stage and
dressing rooms. The material is pur-
chased through local stores and seam-
stresses make them according to the de-
signs.

A few weeks before the perform-
ance, Queen Scheherazade is chosen
from contestants in the eleven high
schools in Riverside County High
School District. The winners are sent
to lndio and, on the first day of the
fair, competent judges from outside
the area choose the queen. The others
are members of her court. They reign
over the fair and have a small part
in the pageant each night, which
brings out the pe0ple from the com-
munities they represent.

The Caliph thought of the job of
putting on the pageant. The greatest
problem had been to find the general
chairman. He or she must be capable,
dependable and full of understanding

 

The simple story must always include
a beautiful princess who will be rescued.

One who will rec-
ognize what working under tension
means and will control, but at the same
time make allowance for, human differ-

for his fellowman.

ences. This is no easy matter since
there are over one hundred members
in the cast. He remembered, for only
an instant, some of the other prob-
lcms—of the time the organist, who
had rehearsed for all the special num-
bers, was suddenly taken ill three hours
before dress rehearsal, and of the time
that the flash powder, to be used for the
appearance of the genie, failed to work,

A Trip to Mexico

and many other memorable quirks.

He smiled now when he thought of
the hours of rehearsal and how, as each
pageant came to an end, the cast re-
alized they had had fun and delightful
association. They would miss it!

But this is the present. The pageant
is about to begin. The Caliph turned
to look at the cast assembled, waiting
for the curtain. The transformation
from everyday people is little short of
miraculous. The awkward teen-age
boys in levis, the meat cutter at the
local market, the optometrist, the
rancher who raises carrots, a judge of
Mecca Township, the owner of an in-
surance agency and the secretary of
the chamber of commerce, who is the
lordly Caliph himself—all trans-
formed after days of rehearsal into
characters of the East.

Nowhere can you find a better ex-
ample of community Spirit. Here,
ranchers and their business
men and women, service station opera-
tors, school teachers, boys and girls,
young and old alike, labor in love to
make possible this community project,
the Arabian Nights Pageant.

A PARTY given at Oregon State College, Corvallis, for 150 members of Associated W'onten Students.

Passport to Mexico: As each guest
arrived she was given a name tag
(eight different colored tags were
used) and a passport slip which had
to he autographed by specified types
of people before she could go into the
next large room for a “tour through
Mexieo.” Autographs required,were of
an East coast member of the group, of
the shortest person in the room, of a
new A.W.S. oflicer, of a blond, of
someone who had already been to Mex-
ico, and so on for fifteen items.

Bean Guess: Two jars of beans were
on display. There was a place on the
passport for recording guesses; and a
prize was presented during refreshment
time (can of baked beans) for guest
who guessed nearest to the, correct
number of beans.

Crossing The Border: Leaving their
passports behind to be checked and
filed, the guests went into an adjoining
room where they formed a large single

600

circle for several rounds of “Ack la,”
a German folk dance.

Games in Various Cities (progres-
sive games): Eight tour leaders, wear-
ing arm-bands corresponding to the
colors of the name tags, led their
groups in “choo-choo” formation to
their proper cities (designated by col-
ored signs posted on the walls such as
Mexico, City, and so forth). Here they
were met by the “city mayor” and in-
troductions were performed, after
which the tour leader and mayors
taught the groups their assigned
games. Groups rotated to the next city
every five and a half minutes. Games
were:

1. Travel to Cuatamala and Bass.

2. Pass the Shoe and Three-Deep.

3. Does She Cackle? and Poor Pussy.

4. Balloon Relay and Raisin and
Toothpick Relay.

5. Nose Bag Dramaties.

6. Travel to Duluth and The Prince 0/

Wales.

8. Stunts. Partners’ wrists were tied
together with string which they

tried to get off without untying,
and “Kerchief Knot-tie.”

La Raspa: All players rejoined in a
circle and danced “La Raspa,” a Mex-
ican folk dance, for four minutes.

Break The Pinata: Winners of the

passport autographing game were
blindfolded and given first chances to
break the pinata.

'Re/resltments: Guests returned to
first room where cheese bits and coffee
or fruit-ade were served.

THEATRICAL TECHNIQUES are playing

properly conceived, produced and pre-

in sociological and economic benefits

now working together toward a com-
mon objective. Such experiences af-
ford an opportunity for these individ-
uals and groups to understand and ap-
preciate each other’s point of view and
obviously tend to build for a better,
more integrated community life.
Detroit’s Automotive Golden Jubilee
in 19416 serves as a fine example. This
celebration, largely financed by the
community-minded automotive indus-
try, marked the sesquicentennial of
Detroit and the 50th anniversary of
the automobile. From the civic stand-
point Detroit had been the scene of
much racial unrest, anti-Negro riots
which shocked the nation and the city’s
administration. As a prime objective
the committees concerned with the

celebration determined to combat this
deplorable condition. As a device they
chose to produce a huge historic spec-
tacle especially written for the occa-
sion and entitled “Song of Our City.”
Some nine hundred local actors, sing-
ers and dancers participated in three
jam-packed performances in Detroit’s
Olympia Arena, where close to sixty
thousand persons saw and heard the
story of their own community and the
people who built it. Detroit’s history
was related not alone in terms of great
men and stirring events, but more par-
ticularly, the day to day contributions
of the many and varied nationality and
racial groups which together built the
community. For the first time in the
history of the city, white and Negro
choirs sang together. Because of the
war, the splendid voices of Detroit’s
German singing societies had not been
heard in public for several years, but
in “Song of Our City” these Americans
of German extraction once more re-
joined the community and, incidental-
ly, were greeted by an ovation. Ham-
tramck, a suburb of Detroit, with per-
haps the largest Polish population in
the United States, had been the scene
of bitter disputes between Polish fac-
tions. “Song of Our City” persuaded
these groups to get together and their
differences were soon forgotten .in a
brilliant swirl of boots and elaborately

embroidered skirts as in a single unit
they presented a series of robust and
delightful folk dances. The United
Automobile Workers Union and the
glee clubs of many individual indus-
tries participated and there were scores
of instances of individuals and com-
munity organizations, normally with
little or no contact among each other,
working in happy, creative harmony.

A week later, as the culmination of
Detroit’s Automotive Golden Jubilee,
massed choirs from the city’s churches
and temples, totalling some five thou-
sand voices, assembled in Briggs Sta-
dium for a special Sunday service and
concert. The star soloist was Lauritz
Melchior and the great Negro choral
groups were featured. An audience of
fifty-eight thousand heard speaker of
the day, Trygve Lie, then Secretary
General of United Nations, who de-
clarcd in essence that events of this
nature produce united communities
and inevitably united communities
must result in united nations. Thus
those who participated and those who
witnessed were, through essentially
theatrical techniques, motivated to act
for the mutual henth of all.

In Pennsylvania, Reading’s year-
long Bicentennial in 1948 is another
case in point. Predominately a rather
drab industrial city, Reading was
founded a little more than two cen-
turics ago by the two sons of William
Penn, Thomas and Richard. lts Quaker

especially featured.

origin, the coming of the Mennonites,
Amish, Dunkards and Moravians, the
Pennsylvania Germans or “Dutch” as
they are popularly miscalled, gave
early Reading a particularly rich her-
itage in folklore and folk arts which
were preserved only in the local his-
toric society, a handful of private col-
lections and between the covers of
books, or debased and commercialized
in the form of badly designed, mass
produced souvenirs. Those in charge
of the celebration, while paying ap-
propriate attention to the community’s
contemporary industrial enterprise, dc-
termined to revive the picturesque
customs and crafts throughout the Bi-
centennial year. Pageants, parades,
street decorations, special events, win-
dow displays, exhibits and even pri-
vate social functions all reflected the
colorful traditions of the community.
A further note of contemporary inter-
national significance was added by the
arrival of the Lord Mayor of Read-
ing, England and his bewigged Town
Council, who as special guests of the
Bicentennial Committee convened in
joint session with the Mayor and City
Council of Reading, Pennsylvania.
Here again a united community worked
together to create a renaissance of
their best traditions and, as a natural
by-product, achieve national publicity
and all the attendant benefits.

In 1949, Winston-Salem, North Car-

olina, celebrated the 100th anniver-

sary of the birth of Forsyth County.
The community produced a historic
spectacle entitled “A Lantern in the
Pines” which, in terms of drama, mu-
sic and dance, related the story of the
development of that area. Film star
Kathryn Grayson, a local girl who
made good, was induced to return as
the leading lady, but of far greater
importance was the participation of
more than six hundred local citizens.
Working together on a voluntary ba-
sis, the cast included several organ-
ized choral groups, the city’s depart-
ment of recreation teen-age and adult
square dance groups, massed bands
from the VFW, American Legion and
five high schools. Little theatre mem-
bers and several Negro actors served
as principals. Here again a happy
precedent was established when the
Negro school band appeared with the
others for the first time in the history
of this southern tobacco capital. It is
of significance to note that, on the
evening of the presentation, Winston-
Salem’s Bowman Gray Stadium drew
a capacity crowd of twelve thousand,
more than four times as many people
as Bob Hope played to in the same
arena two weeks earlier.

Among other outstanding events of

this type are Detroit’s year-long Birth-
day Festival, 1951; The Maine Event,

1952; North Carolina’s “The Lost Col-
ony”—a pageant drama produced an-
nually; and many others.

an opportunity for rhythmic response.
A wide choice of material is avail-
able; however, the most popular
themes are familiar fairy tales, Mother
Goose stories, or historical events.
After the choice of pageant is made,
committees should be set up by the di-
rector with designated groups respon-

eanL

sible for costumes, properties, stage
sets, music, lighting, make-up, and so
on. It is important to have detailed
work and cue sheets for all committees
and frequent meetings so that each one
is familiar with the pageant as a whole.
The costume committee should design
appropriate costumes and preparc sam-
ples, if possible; but the bulk of cos-
tumes should be made by children on
each playground with the help of rec-
reation leaders, parents, or other inter-
ested volunteers. Stage sets and props
should be the responsibility of the
handcraft supervisor and committee.
Again many of the small props and
decorations can be made with the help
of playground participants. Meetings
with the director of the orchestra or
accompanist are necessary to outline

and;_scenes. Details on any special
make-up should be cleared with the
make-up director.

Use special interest groups in your
pageant and give assignments to indi-
vidual stafrr members for the responsi-
bility of games, dances, songs or any
other activities to be included. Through
the daily story hour, skits and panto-
mimes produced on individual play-
grounds, and the daily dance sessions,
much interest and talent can be stimu-
lated for the event. Every child who
is interested should be given an op-
portunity to “be in the big show.” In
working with children whose voices are
not strong, pantomime should be done
to correlate with a narrative read by
an adult or child with a good voice.

A central meeting place for re-
hearsals is necessary and the narrator
should be in attendance. After being
told the story of the pageant and just
where their group will fit in, each unit
can be rehearsed separately, but one
dress rehearsal with all the groups
should be planned. Arrangements for
transportation should be made both
for the dress rehearsal and the per-
formance; and a recreation leader
should accompany each group. Each
leader should have a carefully planned
work sheet with direct, clear, instruc-

 

a
‘

tions giving the time and place for the
dress rehearsal and pageant; instruc-
tions on the place and the order in
which the group should be awaiting the
entrance call; and which entrance and
exit they should use.

On the night of the pageant the
groups should arrive in costume and
each recreation leader should be re-
sponsible for the make-up of his group.
Dressing room facilities and make-up
rooms should be made available for
the main characters, if possible. It is
most important to have assistants who
are thoroughly familiar with the pag-
eant to man the entrances and exits to
keep them clear, and to see that the
groups and main characters are in
their proper places and ready .to make
their entrance at the preper time. If
possible, reserve a place in the audi-
ence where groups who have finished
their parts can go to watch the re-
mainder of the performance.

It is possible to include as many as
three hundred children in a pageant
of this kind if the director, committees,
and activity supervisors plan, co-ordi-
nate, and work together.

One thing to keep in mind is that
your performance must be well done,
No one is happy about a slipshod per-
formance—least of all the participants.

Community Drama Marohes [In

The drama section of the community recreation program is an important one.

 

 

Not only does it give satisfaction to all those would be aetors, provide fun and
excitement—and, for large groups—a means of creative expression, cooperative
activity and adventure, but it can be one of the best means of advertising, and
promoting interest in the recreation department. Furthermore, well chosen
dramatic material can go far toward building positive community attitudes. It
follows, therefore, that this part of the program calls for a clcar-eyed and fear-

less planner!

WE POOL OUR EFFORTS

IN MANY COMMUNITIES in our country
the citizens are aware that whole-
sontc recreation for children builds
strength for living. In these communi-
ties the closing of the school day and
of the school year heralds the opening
of doors to many opportunities for
children of all ages. The citizens in
these communities have joined forces
and pooled resources to meet the rec-
rcation needs of children. Community'-
wide planning has made possible a
continuous year-round program of
leisure time activities for all.

In 19-16 a city-wide recreation pro-
gram was put in operation in Ham-
mond, Indiana, under a newly organ-
ized plan. In the past, some recreation
had been offered but there was much
to be desired in the way of a thorOUgh-
ly coordinalcd program utilizing all
school and park facilities. Little had
been done to bring into the total pic-
ture many other organized groups and
agencies which operated more or less
as individual units. Formation of the
recreation commission set in motion
what today offers llammond children
a wide range of recreational Opportu-
nity.

signed for small children. This pro-
gram is carried on at fiftcen school
sites which afford close proximity to
the home front which the smaller chil-
dren come. Teachers from the regular
school staff are employed and carry on
activities in games, arts, crafts, dra-

to learn through voluntary participa-
tion, because they want to learn. This
program continues for six weeks, from
nine to twelve noon each day, and is
supervised by one of our elementary
school principals.

interesting things. Attendance is en-

is made to provide materials for the

program for children it has proved to
be excellent in-service training for
teachers. It stimulates that invaluable

reaction of parents. Their whole-
hearted support and cooperation indi-
cates that they believe the recreation
school meets a real community need.

The Park Program for
Oldcr Cllildrcn

The program in the parks is one of
similar variety for older children. Cro-
quct, horseshoes, ping-pong, little the-
ater, crafts, and athlctics are some of
the activities sponsored. There is a
complete baseball pr0gram for boys in
the eight to twelve and thirteen to six-
teen age groups. Leagues are formed
and the several service clubs help li-
nance and support the small boys’
basehall program. The Legion Posts
aid the teen-age group. The program
is so organized that high school boys
are able to continue playing baseball
after the school season closes in June.

lntcrested parents usually manage
the small boys’ baseball teams, thus
adding tremendous interest and.sup-
port to the total program. The num-
ber of adults who come out to watch
the boys play causes one to wonder
whether the boys or their fathers are
more cnthusiastic about the leagues.

The park program operates from
noon to 8:00 P.M. Most of the sum-
mertime activity leaders are selected
from among the teachers, coaches, and
college students. The director is given
authority to select his personnel on the
basis of merit. The recreation commis-
sion passed a resolution that the rec-
reation program is to be free of poli-

tics. Heads of other governmental
units in the city have given line c00p-

eration in this.

Other Centers Includcd in
Program

The nucleus of the total program
centers about the Civic Center, a large
community building with a big gym-
nasium, swimming pool, several game
and hobby rooms, and the recreation
department offices. Here the depart-
ment cooperates with many community
grouPs in helping promote such activi-
ties as industrial and church league
basketball, instrumental music and
choral groups, high school basketball
games and tournaments, school music
festivals, school safety patrol parties,
hobhy clubs, instruction in arts and
crafts, square dancing, social dancing,
teen-age “soc-hops,” and other youth
and adult activities.

An excellent swimming program is
offered in the Civic Center for all age
groups. Swimming instruction is given
by an American Red Cross trained in-
structor. Plans are in process to con-
struct three additional pools, in other
parts of the city, which will allow ex-
pansion of the swimming program.

School gymnasiums throughout the
city are scheduled by the recreation
director for various local community
activities through the winter months.
Many of these activities are similar to
those held at the Civic Center. For
example, in one particular school the
recreation department and the Opti-

mist Club carry on an excellent ac-
tivity program for boys. This is su-
pervised by two teachers in that school
who know the b0ys. A great variety of
wholesome activities are provided. The
principal cooperates by coordinating
his school’s intramural program with
these activities. At the same school,
a PTA Sponsors an activity called the
“Stugen” for junior high students, in
which boys and girls hold square
dances and other fun activities. A
similar program is conducted in an-
other outlying school area with the
support of interested parents.

Hammond Fresh Air Camp

One very fine project that ties in
with the over-all set up is the Ham-
mond Fresh Air Camp. This project
gives special attention to those chil-
dren from homes with decidedly lim-
ited means. We might say underprivi-
leged children, but that phrase has a
broad connotation and often may ap-
ply to children from homes with
means. Children are selected from the
public and parochial schools by the
nurses, principals, teachers, and the
child welfare department. These chil-
dren are given a two-week outing at
Camp Okalona on a lake in a beauti-
fully wooded area in northern Indiana.
There they are given good food and
many experiences in working and play-
ing together. They are taught self-re-
liance and responsibility in caring for
their own cabins and mess halls. They

,are given opportunity for a well-super-

vised program of games, swimming,
boating, arts, crafts, and music. Em-
phasis is placed upon spiritual values,
in non-sectarian activities. This pro-
gram is‘financed by the Community
Chest. Facilities and trained personnel
are provided by the Brooks House of
Christian Service which conducts its
own summer-long camping program

607

simultaneously.

The children are selected before the
school year ends. Before the camping
period begins a staff member of the
school attendance and child welfare
department visits every home and ac-
quaints parents and children with the
purpose of the camping project and
discusses what things each child should
take to camp. Its excellent school pub-
lic relations value carries over into the
regular school year, shaping whole-
some attitudes toward school and
school attendance. It’s a wonderful ex-
perience to see these children as they
return from camp with rosy cheeks,
filled out hodies, and the sparkle of
health in their eyes.

Other Cooperating Groups

One of the finest organizations in the
city is the Brooks House of Christian
Service. Located in a community rep-
resenting many nationalities, creeds,
and races, it offers an excellent pro-
gram of informal education and recre-
ational activities. Opportunities in a
variety of hobby clubs for all ages and
all types of athletics are offered. Ser-
vices to individuals in the form of
counseling, library reading, and game
room activities are available. A nursery
school is conducted to help working
mothers. A community service, based
on the town hall principle, provides
many groups with the privilege of
holding meetings and discussing cur-
rent topics in a true democratic spirit.
Religious activities are conducted for
all who wish to participate. Brooks
House conducts its own summer camp
which is staffed with trained personnel
and in which the children earn their
way. Perhaps the finest part of this
total program is that all is achieved
through volunteer participation. City
authorities praise it highly, for delin-
quent conduct is at a minimum in the
community.

Recreational facilities are also made
available to the Boy Scouts and Girl
Scouts. Many of these groups hold
their meetings in the several schools
and the Civic Center. Through the co-
operation of the recreation department,
the Girl Scout organization has been
given rooms in the Civic Center as
headquarters with access to recreation
facilities there. Iioth of these organi-

608

zations conduct their separate summer
camps for a summer program. Also,
day camping experiences are provided
in the Hammond parks for the Cub
Scouts and Brownies.

In addition to the varied program
available through the recreation de-
partment, and other agencies already
mentioned, many of the forty-five
churches in the city provide recrea-
tional opportunities for their young
people. Game rooms, social groups, va-
cation schools, and similar programs
are.carried on.

How It Began

To develop this project necessitated
much effort in planning, organizing,
and cooperating. In April of 1942 the
PTA Council called a meeting of all
local PTA presidents and school prin-
cipals for the purpose of encouraging
a thorough recreation program for this
city of ninety thousand population.
The nation was mobilizing for a sec-
ond world war and there was great
concern for the educational and recre-
ational opportunities for our children
and youth.

History has taught us that during
and following a war there has always
been an increase in delinquent con-
duct. We were anxious to offer young-
sters opportunity for wholesome activ-
ity to counteract this tendency. How-
ever, a good recreation program is in
reality much more than prevention of
delinquency. It is an educational pro-
gram and part of wholesome commu-
nity living. No community can evade
caring for its young pe0ple and still
make progress.

To establish a city-wide recreation
program demands complete coopera-
tion of all community groups, profes-
sional and lay. In this case a commit-
tee was formed by the PTA Council
and the school principals to contact
the mayor. The mayor in turn ap-
pointed a committee which gave rep-
resentative support from lahor, schools,
churches, service cluhs, merchants, and
industrial groups. The local chamber
of commerce lent support to the proj-
ect. This organization became known
as the Central Committee on Recrea-
tion.

The first step was the gathering of
information from olher cities on the

organization of a recreation program.
Many valuable suggestions and ideas
were gleaned from visits to, and lit-
erature from, such cities as Decatur,
Illinois, Madison and Milwaukee, Wis-
consin, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and
other Midwest cities. Only those ideas
which lent themselves best to our local
situation were considered. It was
agreed that all facilities should be util-
ized, which meant that school and park
facilities should be put to use in a co-
ordinated plan. This resulted in so-
liciting the cooperation of the park
board, school board, and the city coun-
cil. In 1945 the state legislature passed
a law permitting the school board to
levy a two- to ten-cent tax to join with
other governmental units in providing
more recreational facilities. This leg-
islation was timely and removed the
question of any legal barrier.

From this background, a governing
board—a city recreation commission—
of five members was formed. A mem-
ber of the school board, a member of
the park board, a member of the city
council, and two lay members make
up the present five-member commis-
sion. This commission functions in an
advisory and policy making eapacity.

The first important duty of the com-
mission was to select a competent rec-
reation director. We were careful to
select a person who was trained for
and experienced in recreation work
both in schools and in parks. The di-
rector is employed and paid jointly by
the park board and school board, each
of whom levy a tax and appropriate
money to support the recreation pro-
gram. By well-planned and careful ex-
penditure these appropriations provide
an excellent program.

The quality of any recreation pro-
gram is in direct proportion to the
quality of leadership and personnel re-
sponsible. In this respect Ilammond
has been fortunate. The complete co-
operation of our superintendent of
schools has made an invaluable con-
tribution to the success of our pro-
gram. Men with a sincere civic spirit
serving on the two boards have given
stability to the project and encouraged
public confidence.

Independence Hall, Philadelphia, where
the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of United States were born.

PHILADELPHIA, where some interesting words about the
pursuit of happiness were written 177 years ago, is
preparing to hear some more interesting words about the
pursuit of happiness when the 35th National Recreation
Congress convenes there September 28.

Suggestions for the Philadelphia Congress began com-
ing in almost as soon as the Seattle Congress closed. Ad-
visory committees are being formed, topics are being stud-
ied and ideas are being sought wherever they may be
found.

A questionnaire was sent to all delegates to the Seattle
Congress and the reSponse has been exceptionally good.
The comments of the delegates at Seattle will prove help-
ful in working out the final program plans for Philadelphia.

The Recreation Congress Committee will welcome sug-
gestions from all who will send them to T. E. Rivers, Sec-
retary, Recreation Congress Committee, 315 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 10, New York. The Committee is eSpecial-
ly anxious to know what topics should be included on the
Philadelphia program, the names of outstanding Speakers
who should be invited to address the Congress, and the
names of recreation leaders in public and private agencies
who can make contributions to the sec-
tion meetings. Ideas with reference to
special program features are always
welcome. The Congress is by nature a
thoroughly cooperative venture and ev-
ery effort is made to try to make it thc
kind of meeting which will be of real
and lasting value to all who attend.

.. .. and the pursuit

of Happiness”

Of unusual interest to the Recreation Congress Commit-
tee was the reSponse to that part of the questionnaire which
dealt with expenses at the Congress. The Committee has
studied the matter of expenses a number of times, most re-
cently in 1947 and before that in 1940. In 1940, 61 per
cent of those who answered the question reported that at
least some of the expenses relative to attending the Con-
gress were paid by the department or agency sending the
delegate and 34 per cent reported reimbursement of all
expenses.

In 1947, 78 per cent reported reimbursement in whole
or in part for expenses of executives, 30 per cent for ex-
penses of other members of the staff, and almost 27 per
cent for expenses of board members.

In 1952, 85 per cent reported some reimbursement, with
53 per cent reporting 100 per cent. Almost 77 per cent of
the delegates answering the question reported receiving
more than half of their expenses and 66 per cent reported
receiving three-fourths or more.

In an earlier study of this question, several ways were
listed for handling costs of attending the congresses when
the agency or department did not include such an item in
the budget or when the amount included was not sufiicient.
Among these were: getting assistance from interested citi-
zens, drawing on special funds, putting on a benefit pro-
gram of some kind and using the proceeds for this purpose.

In some cities the professional workers themselves have
financed one or more representatives’ attendance.

Make a. note now of the dates—September 28—October
2, 1953—and begin making plans to attend! Plan to bring
one or more members of your board. And remember, too,
that wives are always welcome.

Each summer, youngsters—like lhesc wailing for lhc Camp
Dearborn, Michigan, bus—spend happy hours at day camp.

71‘: RECENT years there has been a definite trend toward

increased summer programming in Jewish community
centers. There have been more activities organized and a
greater attempt made to serve all age, groups. Obviously,
this is a very desirable development since the community
center is primarily a leisure-time agency and should offer
maximum program when the membership is most free to
participate.

Determine Program Emphasis

Along with this trend there has been an almost auto-
matic tendency to label every summer program provided
for children a Day Camp. This has led to considerable
eonfusion and misinterpretation, both for the membership
and for the functioning of the professional workers. In
order to develop a more orderly and consistent framework
for summer programming, serious consideration should [)0
given to defining the various types of programs which may
be olTered and to setting limitations upon the use of titles
related to these programs.

The title of an activity does not necessarily indicate the
quality of the experience or its value to the participants.
Almost every activity in the center can and should he op-
cratcd on the basis of sound educational and group work
procedures. Most activities lend themselves to creative ex-
pression luy the children involved. In every instance, it is
important that the leaders be trained and able to under-
stand the psychology of children and to work with them
in an informal and eonstructivc manner. The following are
the suggested titles and definitions for summer activities
which might be used in community centers.

The Summer Center

The Summer Center program may consist of a variety
of groups, primarily the individual interest type such as
crafts, dramatics, dancing, games, swimming, and so on.
Such groups are operated independently of each other
with no attempt to organize an over-all or integrated pat-
tern or framework for the activities. Children may enroll
in any number of groups depending upon the number of
activities available and the amount of time the child de-
votes to the program.

Such activities may be scheduled in a variety of ways.
They may be concentrated in morning periods or in after-
noon sessions. Some activities may be offered daily; others
once, twice or three times a week. The summer center pro-
gram may take advantage of facilities and leadership under
whatever conditions they may be available. It docs not
necessarily require the employment of leaders on a full-
time basis throughout thc summer.

Summer Play Clubs
The Summer Pfay Ciubs or Summer Fun Ciubs program

consists of groups organized into clubs which are based
upon age or interest groupings. These groups may possess
some of the usual elements of clubs in that they may elect
ofhccrs and committees to help plan their program. The
activities of the groups within this type of program may
be restricted to special interest activities such as dramat-
ics, photography, newspaper, crafts; or the clubs may
wish to develop a broader variety of activities similar to
that carried on during the rest of the program year. Hope-
fully, the program will takc advantage of the weather and
try to include as many outdoor activities as possible, dc-
pcnding upon available time and facilities. llcrc, too, there
is generally no integrated organization for the groups; but
it may be possible to develop a club council which can
plan and sponsor inter-group activities such as outings,
festival celebrations, and so on.

The play club program is flexible in the use of time,
facilities and leadership. Some cluhs may meet daily,
some on the basis of other schedules. The organization:
into clubs can provide a basis for the socialization of the
children and may afford club experience for those not
available for center activities dnring the winter season.

Considerations for All Community Center Leaders Who Plan Ahead

Summer Hobby Town

A Summer Hobby Town or Summer Play Town pro-
gram may consist of a variety of interest groups and club
groups tied together by a simple governing structure which
is patterned after the form of government in the particular
city. The children elect representatives from each of their
groups to form a City Council. .They may also elect a
mayor or a city manager and whatever other officials are
required to provide a framework for the program. The
functions of these officials would be to help develop inter-
group activities and to assist with the over-all develOpment
of the pr0gram. The summer hobby town program pro-
vides a valuable experience in democratic self-government
and community participation. Such a program also pos-
sesses considerable flexibility in the variety of activities
and the time schedule.

Summer Play Schools

The general pattern of organization of a Summer Play
School might parallel the philosophy and approach de-

scribed by Mrs. Adele S. Mossler, director of the Play

Schools Association:

The philosophy for the play school, which has been developed
especially for children of school age, is evolved from the field of edu-
cation with its concepts of experiential learning; from group work
with its emphasis on group dynamics; from recreation with its em-
phasis on fun, the use of outdoor and special interests; and from the
mental health field with its concept of the importance of play in the
emotional growth of the child.

The summer play school is an organized group program carried
on all day, five days a week. . . . Centers appropriate for this type
of activity require both indoor and outdoor space. The framework
includes intake interviews with parents, medical reviews, continuity
of regular attendance, assignment of each child to the same group
(according to his age and emotional development), to the same home
room, and to the same leader, facilities, equipment and play materials
especially designed for these age levels.

Among the basic essentials arc indoor and outdoor play, alternat-
ing quiet and active periods, scheduled routines of lunch, rest, show-
ers and snacks, the selection of leaders whose qualifications meet
specified standards, and the writing of individual and group records.
Play schools work closely with the home through parent participation
in the program, individual counselling and group discussion.

Summer Day Camps

Unlike the approaches to summer programming for chil-
dren mentioned above, the Summer Day Camp is an organ-
ized group program conducted in a natural outdoor set-

MARCH 1953

ting. In the summer day camp, which is limited mainly to
daytime hours, the campers are organized into groups com-
parable to the living groups in the resident camp; but
they return to their homes at the end of each day’s pro-
gram. In order to be most effective, a day camp requires
considerable organization. It also requires continuity of
attendance by the children, and most important, by the
counselors. The general program parallels that of the resi-
dent camp with emphasis upon:
l—Cooperative planning of the daily program by camp-
ers and staff.
2—Activities related to the natural outdoors, such as na-
ture lore, hiking, eXploration, Woodcraft, campcraft,
and so on.

Thc site for such programs would of necessity be rural
camp sites within a short travel distance, farms, or state,
county or municipal parks which have sufficient area and
natural resources to make possible a variety of outdoor
activities. Centers have long recognized that such sites
are most desirable for their programs. Chicago, Perth
Amboy and the Irene Kaufmann Settlement of Pittsburgh
use the facilities of state or county parks. In many com-
munities such as Charleston, Detroit, Rochester, Passaic
and Worcester, the centers have been successful in renting
or using suitable camp sites on the outskirts of the com-
munity as a basis for enriching their day camp programs.
In recent years, many Jewish community centers have pur-
chased suitable out-of—town property for their own day
camps.

In a day camp program there is considerable Opportu-
nity for the inclusion of additional program elements, such
as arts and crafts, music, folk dancing, stories and others.
However, no such program can legitimately be called
camping unless it is based to a considerable degree upon
activities related to nature, for which outdoor living is
essential.

With the understanding that it is possible to conduct
varicd types of summer programs simultaneously for dif-
ferent age groups, community centers ought to reconsider
the basic form, content and facilities for each program
and attempt to revise the descriptive titles to make them
conform more closely with the desired program approach.

A talk presented at 34th National
Recreation Congress in Seattle,
September, 1952.

[N leW of the impact of inflation
upon our economy and the reduc-
tion in the purchasing power of the
dollar, municipalities across the nation
are experiencing difficulty in obtaining
necessary funds to carry on their gov-
ernmental functions. They therefore
find it necessary constantly to search
for additional sources of revenue. The
influence of these factors, with the at-
tendant mounting costs of operation
and maintenance, also are being keen-
ly felt in the conduct of municipal
recreation programs. Recreation sys-
tems for the nation as a whole are in-
adequately financed. During 1951, lo-
cal tax support continued to be spotty.
Some cities showed stronger support
than others, and within this range
there were many variations. Although
a majority showed budget increases,
with some exceptions they were suf-
fieient only to meet increased salaries
and operational costs, and did not per-
mit significant increases in services.

Recreation, A Governmental
Function

Significant progress has becn made
throughout the country in creating a
general climate of thinking, both in
official circles and among voters, which
is now recognizing—to an ever in-
creasing extent—thc importance of
recreation in contemporary society and
that recreation constitutes an essential
governmental junction. Nevertheless, as
we view thc eurrcnt national scene, it
is apparent that much remains to be
done to impress Upon officials and leg-
islativc bodies on all levels of govern-
ment, as wcll as upon votcrs generally,
the great contribution that recrcation
is in a position to make in terms of
both short and long range objectives,
if it is truly supported adequately

financially as an essential governmen-
tal function; and it is also clear that
this function may no longer be re-
served for private philanthropy alone.
About ninety per cent of the funds for
recreation and park services now come
from public funds; six per cent, from
fees and charges; and about four per
cent from private funds.

Available Sonrces May Vary

It is rccognizcd that a number of
rather novel sources of revenue for
recreation exist in some municipalities
of the United States, ranging from thc
sale of oranges from trees in the park
system at Winter Haven, Florida, to
the allocation of proceeds from park-

into account to improve the revenue
picture for recreation:

l. The assessed valuation of real
and personal property in many mu-
nicipalities is much too low, and there-
fore the property tax is not yielding
the revenue that it should. For exam-
ple, in the state of Washington, the
assessed valuation of such property is
required to be “fifty per cent of its
true and fair value,” but the ratio of
the assessed valuation to true and fair
value is only slightly over sixteen per
cent and is not uniform in the various
counties of the state. A comparable
situation cxists in many cities and
counties of the United States. Asses-
sors’ offices need to be staffed ade-

Where To Get More

ing meters, over and above the main-
tenancc cost, to recreation at Moores-
ville and Selby, North Carolina, and
Bellows Falls, Vermont; a municipal
payroll tax in Toledo, Ohio; a one-
half-cent retail sales tax for recreation
purposes at Oceanside, California; and
a number of others. However, certain
taxes and sources of revenue for ree-
reation that are available in cities in
some states may not be available in
cities in other states because of pro-
visions of the state constitution, by
reason of the preemption of certain
areas or fields by the state, at least un-
til such time as the state legislature
may be induced to vacate such areas,
or bwause of judicial decisions in a
given state or the background of a
given state or thc local situation.
Therefore, it may not be feasible to at-
tempt to rely upon certain sources of
revenuc that may cxist in other cities
in the country.

flow To Obtain More Revenue

Without attempting to partieularize
the various sources of revenue for rec-
reation. which may or may not be
available in many cities and towns.
there are some considerations of more
general application that may be taken

quately with qualified appointive,
rather than elective, assessors who will
make a scientific appraisal of property
on a professional basis. The issuance
of manuals, by state tax commissions,
containing standards to guide asses-
sors in the discharge of their rcsPon-
sibilitics would be of material assist-
ance in developing greater uniformity.

2. An effort should be made to have
the federal government coinplctely
withdraw from the admissions tax field
so that state and local governments
may be able to look to admission taxes
as a source of revenue for recreation
programs. It is recognized that, by
virtue of a recent act of Congress,
namely, the Federal Revenue Act of
1951 (26 U.S.C.A. [1951 Pocket
Supp.] Sec. 1701), swimming pools,
bathing beaches, skating rinks, or oth-
er places providing facilities for phy-
sical exercise operated by a state or a
political subdivision thereof, if the
proceeds therefrom innre exclusively
to the benefit of the state of political
subdivisions, are exempt from the fed-
cral admissions tax, but federal ad-
inission taxes are still imposed in a
number of areas that might better be
reserved for state and local govern-
ment.

3. A substantial number of cities in
the United States today have con-
cluded that all municipal utilities
should be operated on a service
charge basis and accordingly have
sewer service charges and garbage col-
lection charges, thereby releasing
money in the general fund formerly
allocated for these services for other
purposes. If this were done in cities
in which sewer and garbage collection
charges are not being made, perhaps
more funds could be allocated to rec-
reation. Each city or town must de-
cide for itself whether it desires to
have sewer and garbage collection
charges.

4. Business and occupation taxes

many of the special districts, and their
transfer to the legislative body of the
county or city, would be more com-
patible with sound public administra-
tion. At the present time there are
thirty-four different types of special
districts in the state of Washington,
and something in excess of sixteen
hundred special districts. In view of
the restriction on ceiling on the num-
ber of mills for which taxes may be
levied on real property, and since most
of the mills are earmarked for cer-
tain purposes, the number of floating
mills to pro-rate among the special
districts is limited and the amount that
can be allocated to each is frequently
uncertain. In urban areas of the state,

reational or playground facilities or
structures, as well as for the improve-
ment of particular drives, parkways, or

boulevards. (Revised Code of Wash-
ington 35.43.040 and 35.43.110.)

7. Fees and charges for the use of
recreational facilities should be re-
viewed from time to time (1) to de-
termine whether fees should be in-
creased because of higher maintenance
and operation costs; (2) to determine
whether a fee is tending to reduce or
restrict, unduly, participation in an ac-
tivity; (3) what recreation facilities
should be free to children under a cer-
tain age; and (4) what facilities
should be free to all.

8. Further federal legislation. should

Money For More Recreation Service

on gross receipts of business are be-
ing utilized by municipalities to an
ever increasing extent to obtain addi-
tional revenue, particularly with ref-
crence to utilities, such as light and
power, gas, and telephone companies,
but such taxes on utilities may be
passcd on to the rate payers.

5. Anothcr source of revenue for
recreation is possible through the em
actment of enabling legislation pro-
viding for the creation of park and
recreation districts to include unincor-
porated areas and the whole or any
portion of any city, exclusive of metro-
politan park districts, if the legislative
body of the city consents thereto. A
bill (S. B. No. 252) was introduced
for this purpose at the 1951 regular
session of the Washington State Leg-
islature; it passed the Senate, but died
in the House. The multiplication of
taxing districts has been viewed with
strong disfavor in many quarters be-
cause of the overlapping of taxing jur-
isdictions, the resulting lack of central
analysis of need and priority of over-
all needs of a community, the need for
coordination in tax structure, and the
desirability of keeping the number of
elcctions to a minimum. It therefore
has been urged that the abolition of

MARCH 1953

the forty mills is allocated as follows:
fifteen mills to cities, ten mills to coun-
ties, twelve mills to school districts,
two mills to the state, leaving only one
floating mill, while in rural areas the
forty mills is allocated as follows: ten
mills to counties, twelve mills to school
districts, two mills to the state and ten
mills for road districts, leaving six
floating mills. Pcrhaps, however, a
case can be made for park and recrea-
tion districts because of the varying

be enacted to make adequate provi-
sion for payments in lieu of taxes by
reason of the acquisition of property
by the federal government within the
corporate limits of cities and towns,
thereby placing such property in a tax
exempt status. True, some federal leg-
islation provides for some payments
in lieu of taxes, but much more ade-
quate provision is needed therefor
than exists at the present time.

9. In addition to current appropria-

Dr. Ernest H. Campbell

needs of unincorporated areas, if they
were financed by special levies at pe-
riodic intervals as distinguished from
participating in the pro-rating of the
floating millage that is' not earmarked.

6. Local Improvement District leg-
islation should bc reviewed to deter-
mine if it should be amended to pro-
vide for park and recreation improve-
ments on the basis of special benefits
to certain areas in both incorporated
and unincorporated areas. For exam-
ple, in the state of Washington, the
L.I.D. statutes provide for special as-
sessments to finance field houses, gym-
nasiums, swimming pools, or other rec-

tions, in borrowing, general obligation
bonds continue to be of real impor-
tance; the amount thereof, however,
that can be issued is restricted by debt
limits and sometimes by the nccessity
of securing referendum approval, and
often a certain prescribed number of
votes must be cast and a certain per-
centage of votes thereon must be fa-
vorable. Because these bonds are sup-
ported by general taxes, they com-
mand the most favorable interest rates.
It is gratifying to note that there have
been a number of substantial general
obligation bond issues for capital im-
provements for recreational facilities

613

in American cities during the past
year. To circumvent the restrictions
on general obligation bonds, revenue
bonds are being used to finance recre-
ational facilities that are self-support-
ing, but enabling legislation usually is
necessary to make revenue bonds
available for recreation. Usually there
is no statutory limitation on the
amount of revenue bonds that can be
issued. The only practical limitation
is determined by economic feasibility.
This type of issue commands an inter-
est rate slightly less favorable than
general obligation bonds, but consid-
erably better than L.l.D. bonds. It is
interesting to note that the first reve-
nue bond issued by any city in the
United States was issued by the city
of Spokane to finance a municipal
water system.

Another device that is employed to
avoid the restrictions on general obli-
gation bonds is a lease with an option
to purchase, but generally the interest
charges thereunder are greater than on
general obligation bonds.

10. Annual excess levies also may
be voted by cities and counties, but
usually a certain number of votes must
be cast and a certain percentage of
votes thereon must be favorable in
order for excess levies to be approved
(RCW 81.52.052). It is suggested
that the legislation of some states, in-
cluding the state of Washington, re-
garding the number of votes that must
be cast at such an election should be
relaxed. For example, the word “state”
could be deleted by amending Wash-
ington’s forty-mill statute so that the
requirement that at least forty per cent
of the voters must vote at an election
for excess levies who participated at
the last “general election” would ap-
ply to the number of persons voting at
a municipal election rather than at a
“general state election,” thereby mak-
ing the approval of annual excess lev-
ics much less difficult.

ll. Cumulative reserve funds may
be established for park and recreation
capital improvements by having a cer-
tain amount provided for in the bud-
get each year as long as a cumulative
reserve fund is desired.

In order to avoid being vulnerable

for not having sound administration in
utilizing public funds for recreation,

614

possible economies that may be ef-
fected through improved, sound, long
range recreation planning and full co-
ordination of all community recreation
forces are also essential. Thus in the
interest of efficient and economical op-
eration of recreation programs, consid-
eration should be given to having
schools, parks, and other agencies hav-
ing recreation facilities work together,
to avoid duplication of facilities and
unnecessary expenditures. During the
past year, closer cooperation has been
evident between city and school au-
thorities gnd between cities and coun-
ties.

A number of corporations have been
incorporated, under the laws relating
to charitable, non-profit corporations,
to receive gifts, subscriptions, and be-
quests for recreational purposes; and,
assuming such foundations do not at-
tempt to dictate policy in a manner
incompatible with the public interest,
they frequently can be of material as-
sistance to state and local governments
in financing recreation programs.

Selling the Recreation Program to
Public Officials and to Voters

In order to finance municipal rec-
reation programs adequately, the fi-
nancial needs in recreation must be in-
terpreted and pointed up effectively
and realistically to public officials, mu-
nicipal legislative bodies, and the
voters; and the funds appr0priated or
allocated for this purpose must be
wisely administered. Citizens should
be induced to cooperate with profes-
sional recreation personnel in present-
ing the program to the city legislative
body and to the public generally. It
is important to stress that not only
funds for equipment and necessary
capital improvements are needed, but
also funds for the necessary trained
personnel are eSsential to provide the
requisite leadership for a sound and
well-administered program.

The contributions that recreation is
in a position to make to society, if it
is adequately financed, should be em-
phasized in requesting funds from leg-
islalive bodies and from the voters in
order to obtain the requisite funds for
recreation that will meet the needs of
a community; and both the legislative
bodies of cities and the voters should

be alerted to the fact that the expendi-
ture made for recreation results in
great savings to the community. The
funds allocated to recreation are small
when viewed against the contribution
recreation is in a position to make in
effecting great savings to society, and
in enabling citizens generally to live
more healthful, happy, constructive,
and useful lives.

These constitute some of the major
considerations in the municipal fi-
nance picture today, especially with re-
spect to obtaining more money for
more recreation service.

New Charcoal Grill

"-

 

Some of Tennessee’s state parks are
experimenting with new charcoal fire
grills which, it is expected, will save tre-
mendously on the number of the work
hours formerly required to provide
wood for the outdoor fireplaces. Char-
coal for use in the grills is packaged in
three-pound sacks and sold to the pub-
lie at reasonable prices in the parks.

An announcement about this new
type grill in the October, 1952, Parks
and Recreation Newsletter of the Ten-
nessee Department of Conservation, Di-
vision of State Parks, aroused much
comment and many requests for fur-
ther information from agencies both
throughout and outside the state. The
grill, pictured above. was designed by
Mario R. Scta, State Park Planner of
the division. Of all steel construction,
the top is fifteen by twelve inches and
is mounted on a pedestal thirty-six in-
ches high.

Detailed specifications for construc-
tion of the grill may be obtained by
writing to the Director of the Tennessee
Division of State Parks, Nashville.

Take Advantage of National Music Week

% magma/aha N

Gertrude Borchard

Every recreation department operating or planning a
musical activity can use the occasion of National Music
Week to promote that activity. This would include dance
groups, too, for Music Week programs are not limited to
the art of sound alone.

Dates of the observance this year are May 3-10; the
keynote is “Enrich Your Life With Music.” A secondary
keynote, which has been used since the inception of the
synchronized observance in 1924, is “Foster American
Music.”

Recreation workers in so many places are now putting
into practical application the enrichment of life through
music, among children, young people and adults, that it
would surely seem that the public should get the story—
should realize that music making and profitable listening
are a wholesome, apprOpriate and socially valuable com-
ponent of a balanced, well adapted recreation prOgram.

The ways of taking advantage of Music Week are too
numerous to list, but here are a few recommended by the
National Recreation Association. (The association is one
of thirty-two national organizations sponsoring National
Music Week and has been giving the National Music Week
Committee special facilities for its work, including office
space, since 1943.)

(1) Present your best musical group in a concert, radio or tele-
vision program. See that there is also a talk on the need Of the
work and press publicity for its future plans. If program cannot
be carried by your group alone, COOperate with others in a com-
munity night program.

(2) Obtain a mayor’s proclamation, or join with others in doing
so. The document should incorporate a reference tO the advance-
ment Of music in recreation.

(3) Get one or more newspapers tO run a page Spread the open-
ing Sunday Of Music Week, illustrated with pictures Of recreation
music groups, alone or among other groups.

(4) Announce your summer musical Opportunities for children.
The dual purpose here might be to enlarge participation for this
year and tO pave the way for use Of the groups in the Music Week
celebration next year.

(5) See if one Of the city's leading musical organizations would
be willing to organize a Music Week benefit concert, with proceeds
to go tO recreational music activities.

Other ideas will be found in the 1953 Letter of Suggestions of the
National Music Week Committee. This may be obtained by sending

a three cent stamp tO the committee at 315 Fourth Avenue, New
York 10, New York.

Music in the recreation program today ranges, on the
vocal side, all the way from untrained, group singing to
the artistically acceptable glee club and mixed chorus, and
on the instrumental side, from the rhythm band and the

ukulele group to the symphonic orchestra and band. This
adaptability to needs and conditions can be made to serve
well in planning for Music Week. Thus, a harmonica band
can be used as take-off point in a campaign for a fretted
instrument group, or even a children’s orchestra; a barber
shop quartet may be used to promote a male chorus, and
so on.

In communities in which a citizens’ Music Week Com-
mittee is functioning, the recreation department should be
included in the membership, or should aim for inclusion
in the near future. Better provision for musical facilities
in the department should become an objective of the com-
mittee.

Where there is no central committee, but participation
has been announced by one or more prominent musical,

'civic, religious or youth organization, an effort might be

made to have the program so arranged that attention shall
be called to the place of music in recreation.

Certainly the national observance is a time to enlist in
the cause the aid of radio, television and newspaper. Sing-
ing, playing and dancing by, say, a club of young adults
will be a strong TV attraction in the region, regardless of
technical perfection. A radio series will provide more 0p-
portunities, if less visual appeal. Newspapers can help not
only with editorials and pictures, as suggested above, but
also with articles on the progress of music and the plans
for Music Week participation.

The United States defense forces are utilizing the Music
Week observance to acquaint the country more generally
with the importance placed upon music in the work and
leisure of servicemen. This year the national committee
is recommending that all communities near training camps,
air and naval bases, provide special Opportunities in music
for servicemen and women. Appearances on programs,
and free or nominal priced tickets to the Observances, are
among the suggestions. Similar Opportunities should be
offered servicemen who are home on leave.

In addition to its Letter of Suggestions the national
committee has available a number of publications, most
of which are useful for year-round work as well as for
Music Week. Some of these, issued by the National Rec-
reation Association, are: Music Week and the Recreation
Department (reprint from this magazine, $.15) ; Songs for
Informal Singing, $.15; Roads to Music Appreciation,
$.35; Starting and Developing a Rhythm Band, $.35;
Stephen Foster Program, $.20; Bibliography for Music
Leaders in Camps and Playgrounds, $.15; Directing an
Olde Folkes Concert, $.15. Two publications helpful in se-
lecting compositions by Americans are: America in Amer-
ican Music, $.15, and American Music for Music Week,

Report of Sub-Committee of National Advisory Committee on Recruitment,
Training and Placement of Recreation Personnel

 

IS YOUR in-scrvice training program
adequate? if every employee has
rcachcd his maximum of eiliciency,
and if your department and program
has the fullcst active support of the en-
tire community, including the various
news media, the relatcd governmental
officials, private agencies, commercial
interests, the so-called taXpayers, em-
ployees of your department and what
remains of the general public, you can
sit back for a few minutes and feel
satisfied with it.

ln-service training is receiving a
tremendous amount of attention on
the part of industry, the military,
health and welfare agencies, govern-
ment and cducation. New techniques
of in-service training are being devised
almost every day. in the rapidly
growing area of use of audio-visual
materials, new techniques of interpre-
tation and prcscntation are being dis-
covered constantly. A large portion of
these techniques are being ntilizcd in
in-service training programs.

Some of the objectivcs of an in-scr-
vice training program are to:

l. Develop a professional attitude
on the part of all employees—a fceling
that they belong to an organization to
which thcy can point with pride.

2. lmprovc employee relations.

3. lmprovc good relations with the

provement on the part of employees.

5. Improve the personal develop-
ment of the individual staff member.

6. Properly orient the recreation
employee to his position.

7. improve job skills.

8. Lower Operating costs.

9. Reduce accidents.

10. Reducc turnover.

11. Prepare employees for advance-
ment.

12. Give the employees specific help
in solving the problems that are con-
stantly confronting them.

13. Develop a familiarin with the
history, scope, ohjectivcs, policies.
regulations and ordinances of the dc-
partment.

14. Familiarize employccs with the
place and importance of recreation in
the community.

15. Raise the professional status of
the department.

Early this year, at about the same
time that the National Recrcation As-
sociation establishcd a National Ad-
visory Committee on Recruitment,
Training and Placcmcnt of Recreation
Personnel, with Dr. Paul Douglass as
chairman, the American Institute of
Park Exccutives appointed a commit-

chairman. This committee held a two-
day workshop in Detroit last June and
prepared a preliminary brochure on i11-
service training which is being dis-
tributed to thc membership of that or-
ganization. Representatives of these
two national committees on in-service
training will meet during the winter to
prepare a manual on the subject. At
a meeting of the Sub-Committee on
ln-Service Training of the National
Recreation Association, held in Seattle
during the National Recreation Con-
gress, concurrcnce was givcn to the
following recommendations presented
by thc committee of thc American In-
stitute of Park Executives:

1. That in-scrvice training he made
an integral part of all park and recre-
ation programs.

2. That in-service training sessions.

working hours.

3. That encouragement be given to
supervisory and professional employ-
ees to further their training through
short courses, night classes, institutes,
and correspondence courses.

4. That cmployecs in various classi-
fications he givcn an opportunity to
attend institutcs. confcrcnces, and oth-
er types of mcctings of a training and
educational nature.

5. That recognition. in the form of

ample, the receptionist or secretary
who often serves in that capacity. Does
she know how to answer the telephone
properly? Does she know what to do
when a request is made for informa-
tion? Does she know how to receive
a caller? Is her office neat and at-

There are many I other resourees
available which can be utilized effec-

coming manual on in-service training
will bring these to your attention. All
recreation departments are invited to

Surfaces for Multiple-Use

THE SUITABILITY of existing multiple-use areas for vari-

ous recreation activities was the subject of a question-
naire sent to park and recreation authorities in December;
1951, by the National Committee on Surfacing Recreation
Areas. Of some 250 questionnaires returned, 175 provided
ratings on concrete or bituminous areas or both. A total
of 220 paved multiple-use areas were rated, of which 92
wcre concrete and 128 were asphalt or other bituminous
surfaces.

Authorities rated their multiple-use areas according to
the degree to which they had proved excellent, satisfactory,
fair or poor for each of twelve recreation activities. A to-
tal of 1,413 activity-surface ratings were submitted. The
replies did not afford sufficient basis for the committee
to develop recommendations for surfaces for a multiple-
use area. The information in this article represents an ac-
counting to all who cooperated or are interested, and is
in no sense a committee report on the subject.

Sumlnnry of Ratings

The 1,413 activity-surface ratings are summarized by
surface and type of activity in the accompanying Table I.

This reveals that 537 ratings were submitted for concrete
multiple-use areas, or an average of six per area, as com-
pared with 876 asphalt area ratings, or an average of seven
each.

Analysis of the cases where multiple-use areas were rated
“excellent” reveals that concrete far outranks asphalt in
the percentage of cases receiving this rating. Concrete
areas, for example, are rated “excellent” for roller skating
and shullleboard by a majority of the authorities report-
ing; asphalt failed to receive a comparable percentage of
top ratings for any activity, although nearly half of the
ratings for volley ball and basketball are “excellent.”

The extent to which concrete and asphalt areas received
“excellent” ratings was determined for each activity. Be-
cause different individuals have different rating standards,
and since some surfaces may have been rated “satisfac-
tory” that another individual would have rated “excellent,”
all “excellent” and “satisfactory” ratings have also been
combined for each activity. The results appear in Table
II. Thc combined ratings undoubtedly give a fairer pic-
ture of the opinion which park and recreation authorities
hold than do the “excellent” ratings alone. The percent-

Comments on Concrete and Asphalt Surfaces

The reasons for the various ratings and also a brief ap-
praisal of the various surfaces from the standpoint of their
suitability for a multiple-use area were reported by many
authorities. In studying the questionnaire replies, it is im-
portant to remember that many varieties of concrete and
bituminous surfaces are found in localities. The specifica-
tions used and the nature of the playing surfaces, which
vary widely, esPecially for bituminous areas, determine to
a large degree the suitability of the areas for particular
types of recreation activities. The replies indicate clearly
that some of the surfaces were rated as “unsatisfactory”
not because of the type of material of which they were
constructed, but because of difficulties in their construction
or in the specifications used. A number of comments are
summarized as follows.

Concrete

Several authorities expressed a general preference for
c0ncrete areas, and satisfaction in their use; for example:

Arizona: “Works best.”

Florida: “Can’t be beat.” “No better surface has been
found.”

California: “The best we know.” “This area has more
participation of a free-play nature than any other.”

North Carolina: “The best answer we have found.”
“The most satisfactory surface we have found.”

Minnesota: “Excellent for many activities.”

Texas: “Prefer it (brush finish) to all other types.”
“We find ours most excellent.”

Among the reasons for rating concrete areas highly,

were the following qualities:
Sure footing

Lines painted easily

Accurate bounce

Long life

Good under lights

Drains and dries rapidly
Permits fast play

Usable in all weather
Players like it

Easily cleaned

Little or no maintenance

Can use anyFtype shoes
Not injured in hot weather
Can get type of finish desired

A number of authorities expressed dissatisfaction with
concrete areas; in some cases merely stating that they are
not favored, and in other cases listing reasons why they do
not like concrete for multiple-use areas. Relatively few
authorities, however, indicated a general dissatisfaction
with them. Among the reasons listed as disadvantages were

the following:

High initial cost Wear on shoes and clothing

Lack of resiliency TendenCy to chip and crack
Hardness on feet Abrasive on personal contact
Interference caused by expansion joints

Following are a number of comments on the suitability
of concrete surfaces for specific activities:

BasketbalL—Most comments were favorable.

Handball—Practically all comments were favorable.

Ice Skating—Advantages cited were that the surface
holds water in case of a thawing and it can be frozen
quickly. On the other hand, caulking is a problem and one
or two claim the surface retains too much heat.

Low-Organized Games—Most comments were favorable,
but some believe the surface is not suitable for the play of

619

young children.

Roller Skating—Most comments were favorable, but it
was reported too slick after being used for dancing; that
lines are erased; and that expansion joints interfere.

Shuhleboard—Very favorable comments, but broom fin-
ish is stated to be too rough.

Social and Square Dancing—Most comments favorable,
but some claim the surface tires feet and calf muscles in
social dancing.

Softball—No favorable comments.

Tennis—Majority of comments favorable, but one claims
court accumulates heat.

Touch Football—No favorable comments.

Asphalt

A few general comments on asphalt surfaces are:

New York: “Adaptable to 90 per cent of activity.” “Ex-
cellent.”

California: “Has been highly satisfactory.” “Best and
most widely-used surface.” “Excellent results."

Illinois: “Has proven the best surfacingmaterial.”

Maryland: “Very desirable and successful.”

Massachusetts: “Best found to date.”

Factors resulting in favorable ratings were:

Easy maintenance Courts marked readily

Low initial cost No glare
Good ball bounce Free from dust
Easy on feet and legs Dries fast

Any shoes can be used
Cracks filled easily
All-weather surface
Good footing

Stands up well
llard. clean surface
Popular among players
Facilitates supervision
There are few gcneral adverse comments, although as-
phalt was often pointed out as unsuitable for specific ac-
tivities. A frequent criticism was that it gets soft in hot
weather and is damaged by high-heeled shoes or childrcn’s

play. The major unsatisfactory factors are:

llard on shoes
Marked by heels when soft

llard on balls

The following are comments on the use of asphalt for
specific activities:

Basketball—Very favorable. “Practically equal to indoor
facilities.”

Handball—Generally favorable, but same comment that
ball is not alive and reacts more slowly than on concrete.

Ice Skating—Frequently rated “good” because it holds
water if surface is sealed, but the ice tends to melt too rap-
idly—althongh this can be rctarded by application of a
sand base.

Low-Organized Carries—Many favorable comments, but
several report on injuries, bruises and burns, and some do
not approve for small childrcn’s use.

Roller Skating—Many unfavorable comments. Slower
than concrete. Friction on whecls, and skates cut thc sur-
face in summer.

Shufleboarrl—Many unfavorable comments, but somc
say satisfactory if waxed.

Social Dancing—Hard on shoes and less favorably re-
ported than concrete. Satisfactory if waxed.

Lines wear off
Surface softens in hot weather
Falls result in abrasions

620

Softball—Majority comments unfavorable; surface is
hard on bats, makes game too fast, presents hazard in
sliding, balls roll too far.

Square Dancing—Better than for social dancing, but
many unfavorable comments due to traction and wear on
shoes.

Tennis—Generally favorable and players like it, but sur-
face blackens balls and tends to slow them, especially in
hot weather.

Touch Football-*Definitely unfavorable.

Volley Ball—Almost universally favorable.

Concrete versus Asphalt

A few specific comments were made with reference to
the relative satisfaction on asphalt and concrete courts. A
few follow:

Arizona: “Can use concrete for more things than as-
phalt.”

Iowa: “Prefer asphalt to concrete for all uses except
ice skating.”

Indiana: “Concrete better than asphalt.”

Washington and Maryland: “Asphalt more resilient
than concrete.”

California: “\Vhere ground shifts, asphalt rolls or raiscs
but does not crack like ccmcnt.”

Colorado: “Concrete in this climate gives better contin-
uous use and needs no attention.”

Michigan and New York: “Concrete more desirable for
most activities but original cost much highcr."

Michigan: “Does not chip and crack as concrete does
and is easier on eyes.”

Wisconsin: “Concrete and asphalt too hard for multiple
use.”

Others commented that asphalt is as good as concrete,
but requires more maintcnance; that lines do not show up
as well on asphalt as on concrcte, and that concretc is not
as good as asphalt for tennis.

The majority of the authorities submitting information
did not identify the specific type of concrete or asphalt
surface although it was requcsted that this be done. Fail-
ure to do so minimized the value of the reports and made
it impossible to compare fairly the relative merits of the
different types of concrete or asphalt surfaces.

The relative eflcctivencss of the two surfaces for various
purposes is stated in a lettcr from California as follows:

“We believe this type of installation should be classified
in two groupings: lligh velocity-dcflcction and low vc-
locity-deflcction—the former covering such activities as
tennis and handball, the latter basketball and volley ball.

“In the high velocity-dcflcction group there is, in our
opinion, no substitute for cement concrete with rotary
finish and impregnated color. The specifications for this
type of installation are often too loose, particularly where
large area slabs are involved. The tightening of spccifica-
tions, from establishing stibgradc through aggregate, rein-
forcement, pour and finish, has been most clfcctive.

“In the low velocity-deflection group, the use of asphalo
tic concrete, either hot or cold lay, has proved adequate
and durable over long periods (tcn years and more. using

RECREATION

hot lay, in our case) at low installation and maintenance
cost. The formula and thickness are secondary to com-
paction of subgrade, a common failing being to accept
virgin soil as an adequate base. Oxidation is, of course,
the worst enemy of asphaltic concrete and to our knowl-
edge no effective curative has been developed.”

Summary By Regions

A summary of the ratings was made according to geo-
graphical regions in order to determine to what extent, if
any, the various types of surfaces had proved satisfactory
in different parts of the country. Table III summarizes the
ratings according to five sections of the United States.

Judged by the number of replies, aSphalt is much more
widely used than concrete for multiple-use areas in the
Northeast; somewhat more widely used in the Southwest,
Midwest and Northwest. Concrete is somewhat more wide-
ly used in theOSouth.

In each of the five regions, concrete received a higher
percentage of favorable (excellent and satisfactory) ratings.

The highest percentage of favorable ratings for concrete
was in the Northeast (93 per cent), where only six areas
were rated; the lowest (77 per cent) was in the South.
The highest percentage of favorable ratings for asphalt
was in the Northwest (80 per cent); thc lowest (55 per
cent) in the Southwest.

In the South and Southwest, a majority of the asphalt
areas were reported as unsatisfactory for roller skating,
shuIHeboard, social dancing and square dancing. This was
not the case in the Northeast and Northwest or, except for
shuIHeboard and social dancing, in the Midwest.

Excellent ratings on concrete for roller skating, shufile-
board, social dancing and square dancing excecded the
sum of the other three ratings in the South. This was not
true of the Midwest, Southwest and Northwest ratings.

Summary of Findings

Observations with respect to the frequency of use and
thc suitability of paved areas for various kinds of recrea-
tion activity as revealed by the study are as follows:

I. Asphalt is used more widely and generally than con-
crcte for multiple-use areas, judged by the number of areas
on which reports were submitted. For example, asphalt
areas wcre rated more than twice as often as concrete for

MARCH 1953

 

basketball and low-organized games and nearly twice as
often for volley ball.

2. Of all the ratings on concrete areas, 73 per cent were
“excellent” or “satisfactory.” On asphalt areas, 60 per
cent were “excellent” or “satisfactory.”

3. At least 75 per cent of the ratings on both concrete
and asphalt areas were “excellent” or “satisfactory” for
basketball, handball, tennis and volley ball; on concrete
areas alone, for shuffleboard, roller skating, square danc-
ing and ice skating; on asphalt areas only, for low-organ-
ized games.

4. Judged by the percentage of combined “excellent”
and “satisfactory” ratings, asphalt was rated higher for
five activities, volley ball, basketball, low-organized games,
touch football, softball; concrete higher for other seven.

5. Concrete areas did not receive a single “excellent”
rating for softball and touch football; they did not receive
a single “poor” rating for handball and tennis.

6. More than half the concrete areas received an “ex-
cellent” rating for roller skating and shufiieboard. Asphalt
areas did not receive a 50 per cent “excellent” rating in
the case of any activity.

7. Basketball and volley ball, the most frequently re-
ported activities, are played extensively and satisfactorily
on multiple-use areas, with a slight preference for asphalt.

8. Roller skating and shufileboard, the most frequently
reported activities on concrete areas, are carried on satis-
factorily on concrete, but not on asphalt.

9. Ice skating, not too frequently reported, is generally
successful on concrete. Not so on 50 per cent of the as-
phalt areas.

10. Paved areas are generally satisfactory for low-organ-
ized games, but asphalt more so than concrete.

11. Social dancing and square dancing, frequently re-
ported, are more satisfactory on concrete than on asphalt.
Concrete is somewhat more highly rated for square danc-
ing than for social dancing. A majority report asphalt
“satisfactory” for square dancing, but not for social danc-
ing.

12. Tennis is generally successful on both concretc and
asphalt, although more cities report asphalt “unsatisfac-
tory” for tennis than concrete.

13. Concrete areas were seldom rated for softball and
touch football and most of these received a “poor” rating.
Many rated asphalt areas for these two activities and a ma-
jority of the ratings were likewise “poor,” although soft-
ball is played on it with satisfaction in several cities.

An obvious conclusion from the information summarized
above is that no one type of surface has proved highly
satisfactory for all forms of recreation activity. A c0m-
munity deciding to build a multiple-use area will do well
to determine the activities for which the area will be used
and to select the type of surface that will be most suitable
for the activities to be carried on most frequently and for
the largest number of peOple. It may well prove desirable
to construct more than one type of multiple-use area if the
variety of desired activities is such as to require various
types of surfaces.

People

 

The National Recreation Association feels keenly the
recent loss of two very good friends, Edwin C. May and J.
Thompson Brown, and gratefully acknowledges the part
that they have played in helping to build the Association to
its present position of influence in America, and in their
foresight in helping to provide for its future.

Edwin C. May, whose brother, Walter May, served on
the board of directors for many years, made yearly con-
tributions to the Association for forty years and left a
bequest of $3,000. For two generations many other mem-
bers of the May family have been contributing.

J. Thompson Brown, a director of the E. I. duPont
de Nemours Company Finance Committee and a former
vice-president of the company, was deeply interested in the
work of the Association. He began to contribute to it in
1923 and continued to do so yearly for thirty years. Ap-
proximately twenty years ago, Mrs. Brown also became
interested and began to contribute and to help raise money
for the Association. She was elected as an Honorary
Member. Mr. and Mrs. Brown together have been the
means of helping to interest a great many people in the
work of the NRA.

The Association has been most fortunate, through the
years, in the generous and continuous interest and support
of outstanding men, such as these, who have believed in
the purposes, the spirit, and the effectiveness of the Asso-

There‘are two good reasons why your recreation

'l. The people who participate
in and benefit from your recrea-
tion program will welcome this
addition to the refreshment serv-
ice you now have. Ice cream
not only makes rest periods more
enloyable, but provides basic
food requirements which most
vended products lock.

2. Profit possibilities, too, are
inherent wherever Doiry-Vend
machines are placed. And what
recreation program would not
benefit by additional revenue?

ciation in the growing field of recreation.

Alexander Isabel, the superintendent of recreation for
the city of Amsterdam, New York, recently died of a
heart attack. He was appointed acting superintendent in
1944 and received his permanent appointment in 1947. In
1950 he received an award for “Outstanding Service to the
Youth of Amsterdam”—the third award of its kind to be

given in a fifteen-year period—from the fraternal Order
of Eagles.

Mr. Isabel also served as athletic director for St. Mary’s
Institute in Amsterdam and as up-state New York scout
for the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team.

Bert and Stella Swenson, of Stockton, California,
were recently honored when Swenson Park, the newly
opened city public park and golf course, was named. The
Swensons have been leaders in civic betterment since they
came to Stockton more than thirty years ago. Through

their interest and efforts, the growth of numerous youth
and welfare activities has been accomplished.

e The following chairmen of the Pre-Workshop Com-
mittees for the Second National Workshop on Recreation,
sponsored and financed by The Athletic Institute of
Chicago, are announced: Music—Dr. Max Kaplan, Uni-
versity of Illinois; Arts and Crafts—Frank Staples, Na-
tional Recreation Association; Sports and Games——Vern
Herlund, Chicago Park District; Hobbies—John Sher-
lacker, West Virginia University; Drama—Sybl Baker,

Tips on Care of Floors

0 Know the composition of the floor
and use a cleaning compound which is
suited to it. A cleaner which works
well on a wooden floor may contain
chemicals which are harmful to lino-
leum, terrazo, or other types of floors.
0 Large amounts of water should
never be left for a long period of time
on any floor; and all types of surfaces

should be dried as quickly and thor-
oughly as possible.

0 Floors should always be swept or
dry mopped to pick up all loose dirt
and grit before wet mopping. This is
time and labor saving in the long run
as it makes the mopping easier and
cuts down on the number of times the
mop water needs to be changed.

0 Use of a “tote-tray”-———a flat wooden
or metal box or tray with a sturdy
handle over the top—to carry various
special cleaning compounds, basic tools
and repair materials on daily cleaning
rounds will save many steps and sim-
plify keeping up with minor repairs.
Sandpaper, steel wool, and a putty
knife, to be used to remove wads of
chewing gum and other sticky sub-
stances and to smooth rough spots in
the floor before mopping, are essential
tote-tray items. ,

0 To avoid unnecessary marring and
marking of floors which have been
freshly wet mopped, do not slide or
replace furniture on them until they
are thoroughly dry.

A new handbook, prepared by the
Charlotte, North Carolina, Park and
Recreation Commission for the infor-
mation and guidance of their commu-
nity center staff workers, is the source

624

of the two following excerpts on care
of equipment and janitorial duties
which may prove helpful to other cen-
ter directors in setting up policies on
these phases of community center
housekeeping.

Care of Equipment

The care of equipment is the respon-
sibility of the community center staff
through enforcement of building rules
and through a maintenance and care
program of their own. Here are some
tips on equipment care:

Instruct the janitor to periodically
clcan balls.

Allow only those persons who have
been carefully instructed to operate the
public address system.

Do not permit persons to sit on
tables or on the arms of chairs.

Have arts and crafts classes repair
ping pong nets, paddles, badminton
nets, and so on.

Explain to each individual that he
is responsible for the equipment he
uses.

Explain the care of equipment to
participants.

Keep the piano locked, let only qual-
ified persons play it.

Turn in all broken and unusable
equipment to the maintenance shOp
immediately. Turn in seasonal equip-
ment when it is not needed.

Birthday News

0 Coinciding with their forty-first an-
niversary (March 12), the Girl Scouts
of the United States of America an-
nounce a new prohciency award, “My
Government.” Requirements for earn-
ing the badge include the study of our
basic American documents; the me-
chanics of registration, primaries,
local and national balloting; issues of
the coming elections; public services
and their tax support; the duties and
obligations of citizens; comparison of
our democratic election procedures
with the practices of a Girl Scout troop
government. The basic outline of the
requirements was prepared by a volun-
teer group of League of Women
Voters, in cooperation with educators
and representatives of national organi-
zations and government departments.
Earning the “My Government” badge
will constitute a post-graduate course
in the “Community Life” field of the
Girl Scout program.

0To mark the anniversary of their
organization’s founding, the Camp Fire
Girls annually select a national service
project for the coming year. The 1953
project will be “Down to Earth,” to be
announced during their forty-third
“birthday” week, March 15 to 21. The
more than 370,000 members of the
organization will discover through
“Down to Earth" explorations how the
soil affects their health, wealth and
happiness and how man’s progress
toward better living depends upon the
land and what grows on it and in it.

ing to recordings and piano composi-
tions, using rhythmic instruments—
gongs, symbals, bells, drums, and so
on. The children then express how
they hear and feel through finger paint-
ings, line and free form drawings. A
few notes are learned at a time and
used in song and on instruments, and
the youngsters are then encouraged to
make their own music. Two Saturday-
morning classes are conducted in the
recreation center where the children
may later take part in classes, especially
planned for their age group, in pot-
tery, painting and design, dramatics
and modern dance.

Drama “Fest ival"

The first three months of the year are
busy ones for the amateur drama
groups in the thirteen regions into
which Canada is divided for the pur-
poses of their Dominion Drama Festi-
val.“ They compete in the final re-

gional drama festivals, the last of

which will be held this year in New-
foundland from March 26 to 28. From
May 4- to 9, the best productions chosen
from each region will be presented in
the final annual festival at Victoria.

The adjudicator for the 1952 finals

is Mr. John Allen, actor-author-pro-
ducer, Chairman of the International
Theatre Institute Conference on Youth
and the Theatre, UNESCO, presently
on leave from the British Broadcasting
Company. Executives of the Dominion
Drama Festival feel that Mr. Allen’s
advice and help will be most valuable,
in connection with the increasing num-
ber of children’s theatre companies
which are now producing in Canada,
inasmuch as be was for several years
the administrator-producer for a chil-
dren’s theatre presenting twelve pro-
ductions and two hundred and fifty
performances yearly.

Mr. Richard MacDonald, the Festi-
val's executive secretary-treasurer, re-
ported in the January issue of Domin-
ion Drama Festival News Letter, that
his recently completed tour of Canada
had discovered plans for many new
drama leagues, better attendance
and organization of meetings of exist-
ing groups, more serious thought being
given to the selection of plays. He also
reported an increased interest in the
theatre, particularly on the part of
business men as to the place drama
should hold in national and community
growth. He suggested that the latter
development may have resulted from
the generous cooperation with the ch-
tival of Calvert Distillers, Limited,
whose provision of an annual contribu-
tion of 315.000 towards the operation
of the Festival was announced in de-
tail in July, 1952. A Calvert regional
trophy and cash award of $100 will be
given to the winning group in each of
the thirteen regional festivals. and a
trophy and 31.000 in cash will be
awarded to the group presenting the
best full-length play at the final festi-
val. The company's representatives
have been most cooperative and help-
ful to the individual drama leagues
throughout Canada.

Town and Gown Cooperation

Students in the Community Reerea-
tion course at Elmira College (New
York) have obtained, for several
years, valuable experience in leader-
ship, through field work provided by
the department of recreation in Elmira.
They serve as assistants from six to
nine o’clock, Monday through Thurs-
day evenings, in the city school build-
ings, where recreation is provided for
children, five years old and over. Other
students, under Student Fellowship,
serve as volunteer teachers at the neigh-
borhood settlement house.

Folk Activities on a Campns

Folklore enthusiasts on the campus
of Springneld College have been pre-
sented with an opportunity to share
ideas on, and participate in, folk dances,
music and games, through the good
offices of the Circle and Square Com-
mittee. This student-led group, spon-
sored by the Recreation and Youth
Leadership Division, formerly limited
its program to providing square dances
for the campus community. Recently,
however, they have widened the scope
of their activities to include folk reere-
ation. The result is a weekly workshop

MARCH 1953

—a “laboratory”—-—in which leadership
techniques may be practiced and reper-
tories enlarged. The group plans to
continue operation of campus dances,
present a folk festival and to cooperate
with various ethnic groups in local ac-

tivities. Membership invitations have_

been extended to the entire campus, and
members of the physical education staff
of the Springfield public schools have
also been invited to take part in and
use the workshop as a resource for their

in-serviee training program. .

Line Marker

Ryan Manufacturing Company,
known to the recreation industry for
many years as makers of fine line
marking equipment, has recently an-
nounced their new line of four wheel
visual line markers.

The “New Olympic” is made of
galvanized steel hopper construction
with four aluminum alloy wheels for
lighter weight and ease in handling.
The total weight of the marker is only
42 pounds and it has a capacity of 100
pounds of any line marking substance
including talc, gypsum, marble dust,
lime, chalk, and so on. For informa-
tion write directly to Ryan Manufac-
turing Company “B”, 3463 Motor Ave-
nue, Los Angeles 34, California.

Zip Clip

Zip Clip is a drive-in metal clip
which enables anyone to put up
shelves, partitions, and so on, in a
jiffy with no other tool than a ham-
mer. It is driven in like a nail, and
forms a rigid slotted support without
the use of nails or screws.

 

1Made of 22 gauge heat-treated hard-
cned steel, Zip Clips arc in the form
of channel pieces, 13,3; inches in length,
5/ l6 inch deep and 5,46 inch wide.
Extending from the back are four
sharp prongs which, when the unit is

632

pounded in, provide a support for
shelves or partitions. The channels are
designed to take up to quarter-inch

plywood, regular wood, masonite,
glass, cardboard, sheet metal, and so
on; however, shelves of material too
thick to fit into the channels may be
supported by resting it on t0p of the
clips. To install a shelf, all that is
necessary is to pound a few Zip Clips
into the vertical sides where the shelves
are to extend across, slip the shelving
into or on top of the channels and the
shelf is up. They can also be used as
supports for drawer dividers, bin divi-
ders and pigeon holes in stock rooms,
tool and supply compartments for hob-
by shOps, and so forth.

Zip Clips are sold in stores, six for
3.25, or availahle postpaid, twenty-
four for $1.00, from the manufacturer,

Fleekel Glaze

Fleckel, a new glaze with tiny specks
of color in it, has just been announced
by the Pemco Corporation. It is a
clear gloss glaze with a choice of pink,
blue, blue-green, brown or black specks
which come out in firing as tiny, in-
dividual flecks of color; or when fired
slightly higher, the specks in the glaze
will flow or “feather.” This means
that two effects are possible with each
color.

Fleekel provides a multitude of deco-
rative possibilities for craft pottcrs.
The colors can he combined for spatter-
dash patterns or hoth the clear specks
and the feathery effects can he used
on a single piece by an extra firing.
It can be used over a white or colored
body or it can be applied over under-
glazc colors. it can be combined with
other glazes as an artistic border, band
or medallion and used on figurines as
a quick and easy method of providing
patterned areas for dresses, hats, and

so on. This new glaze is supplied in
liquid form, packed in four-ounce jars
which cost 3.85 each. It is made up in
two series; one for clay hodies that
mature at conc 010 and one for those
that are regularly fired to cone 06.
Distribution will be through regular
Pemco dealers. For further informa-
tion write to the Pcmco Corporation,
Pottery Arts Division, 5601 Eastern
Avenue, Baltimore 24, Maryland.

Trix-Swing Batting Instrueto r

Several recreation departments have
been using, with success, the Tru-
Swing baseball batting instructor or
tee, a device which simplifies the teach-
ing of batting fundamentals and speeds
up the game for eight-to-tcn-year-olds.
In ordinary baseball, with this age
group, much of the playing time is
wasted in waiting for a young pitcher
to get a ball into the strike zone. Tru-
Swing eliminates this wasted time and,
as a result, youngsters get more fun
out of the game. Use of this batting
tee also teaches the batters to hit
properly, keeping their eyes on the
ball and hitting only good pitches by
keeping a level swing.

The base of the Tru-Swing is a regu-
lation home plate, made of rubber and
weighing 14 pounds, with ten holes in
which one of the flexible uprights may
be inserted to simulate any given pitch.
There are four uprights of different
lengths with each tee and these, with
the various positions of the holes in
the base, permit the ball to be placed
as an inside, outside, or right-down-
the-alley pitch at four different heights
between knee and shoulder. The ball
used is a regulation hardball; and it
is placed on the t0p of the selected
upright.

In the picture, one of the tees is

 

shown in use during a game at War-
ren, Ohio.

Detailed information about the Trn-
Swing batting instructor may be ob-
taincd hy writing to Tru-Swing, Post
Office Box 623, Warren, Ohio.

Masters Theses in Health,
Physical Education and Recreation

Thomas K. Cureton. American Asso-
ciation for Health, Physical Educa-
tion and Recreation, Washington,

Dc. Pp. 292. $3.00.

The purpose of this book is to serve
as a convenient index for writers and
research workers in education, recrea-
tion and related fields. It lists and
elassifies 3,878 masters theses and is
complete through the year 1916. The
list includes some theses completed in
other academic departments on a tepic
in physical education, health or recrea-
tion which was sponsored or advised
by a member of the physical education
staff.

The topics are classified in the same
manner as was the index of doctorate
theses prepared by Dr. Cureton and
published in the Research Quarterly
for March, 19-19. Theses are classified
according to topics, the principal em-
phasis in research method, and the
institution in which they were sub-
mitted.

The summary of the fields covered
indicated 2,265 theses under the gen-
eral heading. “Health, Physical Educa-
tion and Recreation,” as compared
with only four in the field of recrea-
tion. The individual theses are classi-
fied by number under a variety of
topics such as “Recreational Time,”
“Playground Facilities,” “Recreational
Facilities,” “Organization of Play-
ground Programs,” “lntercst Prefer-
ences,” and so on. Although a ma-
jority of the topics listed are not di-
rectly related to recreation, the volume
indicates the nature and extent of the
masters theses that have been prepared
in recreation and related fields.

Community Uses of Public
School Facilities

HaroldH. Punke. King’s Crown Press,
Columbia University, New York. Pp.
243. $3.75.

Recent decades have seen a marked
extension in the use of public school
facilities by community groups. Mr.
Punke has rendered a valuable service
by his analysis of judicial opinions re-
garding community uses of sehool fa-
cilities. llis book represents a study of
238 eases on the subject which have
come before the nation’s higher state
and federal eourts.

Cases have been grouped for anal-
ysis under several headings, such as
“Uses for Which School Authorities
May Acquire Facilities,” “Religious
and Parochial Uses,” “Cultural and
Entertainment Uses,” and others.

lu summarizing the uses for which
school authorities may acquire facili-
ties, Mr. l’unke states, “Land for play-
grounds and athletic fields may be ac-
quired by school boards, under their
general authority to maintain schools,

although there may be dispute regard-
ing the amount of land which may be
acquired for the purpose.” Many cases
cited relate to such questions as the
location of a playground, the purchase
of bleachers for a high school athletic
field. or the provision of a stadium.

The use of school facilities for com-
mereial profit-making purposes consti-
tutes a type of community use on which
courts are divided. Wide variation is
also noted in the decisions relating to
the cultural and entertainment uses of
school facilities. “This range and de-
viation are particularly significant in
revealing judicial attitudes on general
community uses of school facilities.”

Of special interest to recreation
workers is the chapter entitled “Tort
Liability of School Districts in Connec-
tion with Community Uses of School
Facilities.” The materials in this chap-
ter show that, for the United States as
a whole, there has been a gradual shift
from governmental immunity in tort.
Non-school cases seem to reflect this
shift more clearly than school cases.
To some extent this shift has taken
place through judicial reasoning. In
the epinion of the author, “ln several
respects a change in legal framework
to provide generally for tort liability
of school districts for injuries resulting
from employee negligence might be im-
portant in extending community uses
of school facilities. An important type
of community use of such facilities re-
lates to playground and recreational ac-
tivity." Suggestions are offered as to
safeguards which might minimize in-
juries to persons using school proper-
t'. One of the conclusions reached is
that ordinarily where school districts
are liable in tort for injuries sustained
by pupils they are also liable to adults
injured whcn legitimately on the prem-
ises for some authorized community
use.

The concluding chapter presents
opinions with reference to the social
implications growing out of the com-
munity use of school facilities. The
importance of tlicir use by the com-
munity is felt to be especially great in

RECREATION

rural areas.

The wide-spread authorization for
the use of school property for a recre-
ation program under the auspices of
a public recreation department and the
general approval of such use by the
public are implied by the fact that no
case was cited in the volume relating
to such use of schools for a community
recreation program.—George D. But-
ler, Research Department, National
Recreation Association.

Kites
H. Waller Fowler, Jr. A. S. Barnes

and Company, New York 16. Pp.
95. $1.75.

Subtitled a “practical guide to kite
making and flying,” this latest addition
to the Barnes Sports Library is the
kind of easy-to-understand resource
material all recreation departments
should have. Professional and volun-
- teer leaders working with older ele-
mentary-school-age children will find
a wealth of information in this volume
to help them conduct kite activities.

Mr. Waller is obviously a man who
enjoys his kite flying. He wants others
to have fun also. Most of the book is
concerned with how-to-do-it explana-
tions, but the introductory pages give
enough of the history of kite flying to
add some real zest to making and fly-
ing even a basic three-sticker. With a
little imagination a ten-year old might
consider himself Ben Franklin bring-
ing electricity out of the sky. Or he
might be hoisting a fellow soldier a
hundred feet off the ground to see
what was going on behind enemy lines
——-a use to which Mr. Waller tells us
kites were once put.

For the small-fry interested in air-
planes, kite making and kite flying can
make him conversant with the lingo of
pilots. Mr. Waller starts his brief
chapter on theories of kite flying with
the statement that “both airplane and
kite stay aloft because of the move-
ment of air against or across or around
a nearly plane surface. The kite is
really an anchored airplane. . . .”

Even the recreation leader who is all
thumbs will find the chapters on kite
construction simple to follow. And if
the interest in kites progresses as it
should, by the end of April—the close
of the kite season—the kite maker may
be going in for the box kites, tetra-
hedral, combination and novelty kites
described by Mr. Waller.

A valuable final chapter in the hook
has special intercst for recrcation lead-
crs. Common classifications are given
for kitc contests; and simple direc-
tions for organizing and administering
kite contests are spcllcd out. Since kite
flying requires the kind of open space

lVfARCII 1953

that is found only in public parks and
recreation areas in most cities, kite
flying really should come under the
special interest and promotion of the
municipal recreation and park agency.

There are a number of other things
which could be said about this book,
but time doesn’t permit—we’re on our
way to buy some kite making materi-
als.—David I. DuBois, Research De-
partment, National Recreation Associ-
ation.

Photography Afield

Ormal I. Sprungman. The Stackpole
Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Pp. 449. $7.50.

In the preface to this beautiful book
Mr. Sprungman, camera editor of
Sports A field since 1934, says: “Pho-
tography is a great and wonderful
hobby. As a companion to hunting and
fishing and outdoor life. . . . it can
capture momentarily, and without
bloodshed, the little creatures that race
over the land, live in trees, swim the
lakes and trace their patterns across
the sky.” His chapters, in which he
proves this assertion, convey the zest
and thrill of such an activity. In addi-
tion, they present detailed information
on the hows and whys of the planning
and the taking of a good photograph;
and they range from a discussion of
the sportsman’s camera to movie tak-
ing and presentation. They also in-
clude such intriguing t0pics as “Un-
expected Camera Thrills,” “Compos-
ing the Scene,” “Camera Gunning,”
“Bird Photography,” “Filming Big
Game,” “Filming at Night,” “Camera
Pot Shots,” “Color Work,” “Dark-
rooms Afield,” “Travelogs,” “Close-
up Story Telling,” “Movie Tricks,”
and many others. In fact the author
seems to have covered every aspect of
the subject; and he has liberally illus-
trated the publication with his own
stunning photographs, some of which
are in color. We suggest that all cam-
era fans, or would-be fans, make their
way to the nearest hookshop and look
this over for themselves.

Mr. Sprungman’s stills have ap-
peared in many magazines of national
circulation, including Life; and he
served in the navy as photographic of-
ficer. His photograph of a groundhog
was used as the cover picture for the

last issue of RECREATION—February
1953.

Ono-Pot Cookery

Eidola Jean Bourgaize. Association

Press, New York. Pp. 126. $2.50.

It will not be long before campfires
are once more aglow, and the aroma
of good things to eat will lure campers
down the trail of outdoor cookery——

from the mountains of Maine to the
coast of California. This book on the
subject, therefore, is an appetizing
foretaste of things to come. It goes
into detail, first of all, about the build-
ing of good cooking fires and how to
divide the cook-out jobs, and there-‘
after presents a collection of delicious
and well-tried recipes gathered from
all corners of the country. These are
not of fancy dishes, but of the simply
prepared, inexpensive, tasty fare which
goes so well with a campfire especially
when well-spiced with hunger and with
laughter. Just published!

Summer Magic

Kenneth B. and Susan H. Webb. As-

sociation Press, New York. Pp.

Anyone interested in camping, from
whatever viewpoint, will find this ex-
cellent pre-season reading as well as
useful for reference later. It deals with
the values obtained from and offered
by the well-planned camp program—
and with the building up of those
precious and enduring memories of the
campfire or of other enchanted mo-
ments.

Parents like to weigh the benefits of
a summer camp very carefully, before
sending their offSpring out of reach of
their own supervision. This book will
not only help them to do this, but will
give them ideas as to how to discrimi-
nate among good camps when looking
for particular values.

It can be especially helpful to coun-
selors, too, in reaching an understand-
ing of their own responsibilities and
in using resourcefulness in the plan-
ning of their programs.

The experiences of two camp direc-
tors are given in running narrative
form—as are the points of view of two
parents. The book makes for interest-
ing as well as informative reading.
Don’t hesitate to add it to your camp-
ing library.
