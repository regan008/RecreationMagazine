The
Philosophy of Recreation

Harold W. Kennedy

From address prepared for the Seventh
California Recreation Conference, 1955.

ECREATION is not, and cannot be expected to be, a pana-

cea for all the antisocial forces of an unplanned society.

At its rudimentary worse it can relieve the boredom of aim-

less leisure hours. At its finest it can illuminate the life of

the individual with cultural electricity and solidify the com-
munity with the feeling of belonging.

Our philosophy has incubated over the centuries. Indi-
vidual recreation is as old as man himself. The drawings of
mastodons and sabre-tooth tigers found in ancient caves
bear evidence to the fact that “adult recreation” was known
during the dim infancy of civilization.

We do not know when community recreation began, but
there is no doubt it existed in primitive society. The fact
that original organized sports are found in present-day sav—
age tribes indicates that this is true. We also know, of course,
that the Athenians had developed and stylized competitive
sports long before the birth of Christ.

In our complex modern society, the state and local govern-
ment agencies have been called upon to a greater extent to
fill the recreation needs of the peOple. The school, church,
and home, which formerly carried almost the entire load,
still carrry a large bulk of it.

Basically Recreation is a Human Need

Some writers have described recreation as a “social
force.” Others have called it a “government responsibility.”
Actually, of course, it is a basic need, a universal hunger.
Among all peoples, and in all stages of history, man has
found outlets for self-expression and personal development
in forms of recreation of striking similarity. As Joseph Lee
put it, “The muses that have whispered to us are the same.”
We cannot analyze human needs in the same manner in
which we can chemically analyze the human body. Never—
theless we know that the individual deprived during working
hours of ability to create, to feel a sense of belonging to a
group, to exercise his whole mind, soul, and body as one
organism to release his combativeness—that individual is
starved for recreation.

The chief objective of recreation is the happiness and
contentment of the individual. All other purposes are by-
products, valuable to be sure, but secondary to the one
basic function. This has not always been recognized. The
gloomy philosophers of the Victorians and the “joy-is-sin”
prejudice still have not been entirely shaken off. The true

mittee on Children and Youth.

philosophy of recreation requires a realization that joy of
living is an entire and legitimate facet of life itself.

Recreation Brings Satisfaction in Achievement and Health

One of the unfortunate products of technological society
is the unbalanced growth of the individual. Forced to spe-
cialize for efficiency, the worker loses the satisfaction that
the artisan finds in his finished product. He loses manual
and mental skills. Proper recreation will restore these skills
and revitalize the forces of creativeness and culture. Ac-
cording to Dr. Austin Fox Riggs, “The function of play is
to balance life in relation to work, to afford a refreshing
contrast to responsibility and routine, to keep alive that
spirit of adventure and that sense of proportion which pre-
vents taking oneself and one’s job too seriously, and thus to
avert the premature death of youth, and not infrequently the
premature death of the man himself.”1
' It is almost axiomatic that recreation is essential to physi-
cal fitness and sound development. The wholesomeness of
man derives its nourishment from a balanced exercise of all
the parts of the total being—the mind, the muscles, the
emotions and the spirit.

“While the worth of recreation as an aid in restoration of
health and soundness is receiving increasing endorsement
from the medical profession, its paramount value derives
from its dual contribution, subtle and immeasurable, to
euphoria, and as a preventive of nervous disorders. Release
from strain, translation from self-concern to absorbing in-
terest, and the concurrent discovery of the friend you can
be to yourself, by rest, play, or doing something you really
want to do—such is the insurance recreation writes against
the mill-run miseries and ills of too much self.”2

Recreation Develops Education and Skill

Interest in any type of activity is heightened as skills are
improved. It is impossible to read, paint, or play a musical
instrument without absorbing some of the culture of litera-
ture, art, or music. One cannot hunt, fish, or hike without
unconsciously developing into an amateur naturalist.

According to L. P. Jacksa recreation is not pleasurable
unless educational. “Man, the worker, and man, the player,
are not two men, but one. Not two halves of one man either,
but one viewed in different aspects; so that if you train him
for his work by one method and his play by another, you
will find that you are not training him at all but dividing him
against himself.”

Somewhat paradoxically, though play involves education,

RECREATION

much of our population must be educated in how to play and
relax. Students of geriatrics find that in our mature citizens,
the talents, skills, and enthusiasm for recreation activities
have been lost. Here the professional in recreation can
observe both his failure and his opportunity—the oppor-
tunity to inculcate into youth skills in hobbies and games
which will remain through life, and to assist older people to
rediscover lost pleasures, and to discover new ones.

Recreation Brings Social Values

It is a truism that happy, creative, cultured individuals
will make up a society with the same attributes. Aside from

devil’s workshop” philosophy.

G. Ott Romney, in 0}} the 1 ob Living, characterized this
approach as follows: “When an individual caught tempta-
tion to naughtiness casting covetous eyes at him,‘the in-
tended victim was advised to immerse himself in some busy-
ness which presumably brought him pleasure as well as
safety, such as making furniture or working on a stamp col-
lection or painting a picture.”

It is true that while stringing beads it is difficult for a
child to engage in juvenile mischief, for instance, but the
same effect could be provided by locking him in a secure
closet or stunning him with a blunt instrument. Merely keep-
ing busy is not “recreation” and calling it such obscures the

real values of recreation in its true sense.
The positive approach is more emotion than motion, more
whetting the appetite than force-feeding. In short, this phi-

losophy of joy for the sake of oy recognizes that happiness
and contentment create a finer person.

The social values then follow naturally. Juvenile delin-
quency, crime, mental illness, alcoholism are but a few of
the evils which can be alleviated.

The professional in recreation will do himself and his
cause the greatest service by now and again lifting his head
from his tasks and snifling the heady and rarefied atmosphere
of the true philosophy of recreation. He can truly say to him-
self, “My ob is bringing happiness and light to mankind.
Than this, there can be no more noble profession.”

Reference has been made to the importance of the normal
needs of people for balanced living, relaxation, and recrea-
tion activity. As we face the uncertain tomorrow against
the tragic backdrop of the appalling catastrophic possibil-
ities of destruction in the atomic age, we need no further
arguments for the importance of recreation. While yearning
devotedly for peace, by national necessity we must prepare
for war. While wanting to understand and not be misunder-
stood by the political leaders of the Soviet Union and the
Chinese Communists, we are mindful of the deterioration
that their propaganda, their devices, their techniques, their
trickery has brought in the minds of men. So, you see, in
such an atmosphere your day-to-day work in the field of rec-
reation assumes an increasing importance. However, we
must be hopeful for the future. I

A Living Dynamic Being
Sirs: ' I

It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity
of commenting on Mr. Mowrer’s article
“Recreation—For What?’f in the De-
cember issue of RECREATION.

This question of heredity versus en-
vironment is age-old and certainly we
have no solution to it at this time. Sim-
plified, we might say heredity is the
gift of potential and that environment
consists of those factors which influence
the success or failure of an individual
to reach this potential. Our American
civilization is created to develop ways
and means of reaching this potential.

Again, simply stated, recreation seeks
the constructive use of leisure time. By
constructive use, we mean seeking an
individual’s fullest development within
the limits of his potential. This is also
the objective of the home, church,
school, and other social forces in
society.

If all these forces succeed, we can ex-
pect to find a well-integrated individual.
Would he be any less a genius because
of his education, or less a leader be-
cause his heredity potential was virtu-
ally reached through the efforts of so-
ciety’s social forces? We believe man’s
greatness depends upon developing his
gifts and abilities to the greatest level.

Man’s integration into society does
not negate his change of individual
development. Rather, it is fostered
through excellent education, personality
and character development, improved
health, a happy home life, and high
spiritual and moral values.

Well-integrated persons in our soci-
ety are not free from frustrations. Life
is full of frustrations, large and small.
The frustration of boredom is certainly
not a result of recreation. Recreation
seeks the elimination of boredom by
giving new outlets to restless and non«
integrated individuals. It seeks to de-
velop creativity, to encourage activity
rather than passivity.

Mass activity is just one facet of rec-
reation. Individual and group activities

5|

——The Editors.

are certainly equally important. An in-
dividual’s potential greatness will flower
in that kind of activity most appealing
to him as he sinks his roots and de-
velops strong limbs on the tree of life.

“Civilized boredom” is the result if
society fails in any respect. Organized
recreation is dedicated to the cause that
man shall not be lonely and bored, but
a living, dynamic being; for from such
has America become great.

ent of Recreation, Washington, D. C.

Personnel Practices

Sirs:

I believe that Mr. Sutherland’s article
in this issue represents an excellent
summary statement of the desirable
s00pe and content of a well—rounded
personnel program for employees of a
recreation organization. Certainly it
should provide some excellent guidance
for any recreation administrator who
wants to take stock of his existing per-
sonnel practices and improve them
Where necessary.'

One major problem, which he may
have intentionally avoided in the pres-
ent discussion, is to find practical an-
swers to the question: “How can the
head of a recreation organization find
the time and the know-how to set up
and operate a good personnel pro-
gram ?” There are at least three kinds
of administrative settings which need
to be considered in finding answers to
this tough question. They are: (a) the
public recreation agency which operates
within the framework of a formally es-
tablished civil service program, and
which must deal with officials of the
central personnel agency; (5) the public
recreation agency which is entirely out-
side the scope of any formally estab-
lished civil service programs, and which
is therefore presumably free to “write
its own ticket”; and (c) the recreation
agency which is essentially private in
character and is definitely not public
In nature.

In each of these three groupings, of
course, there will be large, medium
size, and small organizations. It is rea-
sonably safe to assume that the great
majority of the large ones which are
public in character are within the frame-
work of some formally established civil
service system. The essential problem
for this type of an organization is to
set up some internal personnel machin-
ery for working jointly with the staff of
the civil service agency and carrying on
certain kinds of personnel activities
pretty much on an internal basis. The
specific point I have in mind is this:
In such a case, one of the best first steps
which top management can take in the
direction of improving its personnel
practices is to designate some one per-
son in the administration setup to be re-
sponsible for personnel matters. If the
organization is big enOUgh to warrant
making this a full-time job, then it
should be full-time. If it is not regarded
as a full-time job, it still can be made a
part-time assignment for'the assistant or
chief deputy to the head of the organi-
zation. In other words, I believe that it
is essential to recognize personnel ad-
ministration as an important major
aspect of over-all administration, and
to assign specific responsibility for car-
rying out the day-to—day aspects of the
personnel job.

The “type (1))” cases—~—the public
recreation agencies outside the frame-
work of a formal civil service system—
pose a more difficult problem. This is
particularly true in smaller cities, which
on the average have fewer service-wide
civil service systems. Also, since the
total size of the recreation department
is somewhat smaller, it is up to the head
of the agency to be his own personnel
man along with his hundred-and-one
other responsibilities. It is this type of
individual, I assume, that Mr. Suther-
land has primarily in mind in beaming
his suggestions. More specifically, as
I see it, the problem becomes one of an-
swering the question: “How do you
develop and administer a practical per-
sonnel program for a recreation depart-
ment having less than twenty-five em-

ployees?” Even for an organization of
that size, it is possible to have some
type of semi-formalized job classifica-
tion plan with a set of standard pay
ranges attached to each job. It is also
desirable to have a written policy state-
ment on various basic subjects like
leave policies, handling of grievances,
promotional policies, and so on. Fur-
thermore, it is very desirable to set up
a workable system of personnel records.
I certainly do not want to over-empha-
size the need for adequate records, but
it is very diflicult to carry on a person-
nel program with no personnel records

RECREATIle

whatsoever. I believe it is desirable to
mention them specifically.

I do think, however, that it would be
desirable to indicate Whether this is in-
tended as a general “across-the-board”
treatment of the personnel problem, or
whether it is aimed essentially at the
smaller recreation organization that is
either inside or outside the framework
of a civil service system.

Slrs:

I have thoroughly reviewed the arti-
cle “How Are You Doing on Person-
nel Administration?” and frankly feel
that it includes the essential factors per-
taining to personnel problems that
many recreation administrators are
facing today. The article will provide
an excellent opportunity for adminis-
trators, whether they be in the recrea-
tion or personnel field, to make a com-
prehensive review of their procedures,
policies, and practices, with a view to-
ward self-improvement and making
adequate and proper plans for future
established objectives and procedures.

Too often we do not carefully evaluate,

our own working methods.

In relationships with personnel de-
partments, I have found it essential to
have clear-cut concepts pertaining to
the qualifications of the prospective em-
ployee in relation to his or her respon-
sibilities in the position. Furthermore,

after employment, it is essential that
the employee be aware of his duties,
responsibilities, and the personnel bene-
fits as established by the personnel de-
partment. Lately we have followed a
policy of preparing mimeograph mate-
rial relating to the vacancy which in-
cludes: position, salary, education, ex-
perience, age limit, qualifications, job
duties, and general information pertain-
ing to the position and the community.

This material is distributed either by
our department with the approval of
the personnel department, or by the per-
sonnel department, to the National Rec-
reation Association and the various uni-
versities throughout the southern and
eastern areas of the country. We have
found that this greatly aids us in our
recruitment procedure and tends to at-

tract applicants who actually qualify for»

the position.

Comments on Mr. Sutherland’s arti-
cle:

Selection: Provide an opportunity for
the applicant to ask questions pertain-
ing to the position, the agency, and the
community, and leave him with a favor-
able impression. This will more readily
emphasize the two-way communications
in. the personal interview.

Training: The systematic evaluation of
an in-service training program in rela-
tion to the job duties cannot be over-
emphasized.

Extra Bene'nts: Suitable job injury ben-
efits over and above workman’s com-
pensation should be encouraged.

Additional Considerations: A very im-
portant additional item might include
“Periodical evaluation of employee’s
work.” Only in effective formal or
informal procedure can an employee
improve his quality of work to the satis-
faction of the employer. The self-ap-
praisal forms, such as prepared by the
National Recreation Association Per-
sonnel Service, could be utilized to a
great advantage, serving as a guide, as
judgments are subjective in nature.

I certainly wish to take this oppor-
tunity to congratulate Mr. Sutherland
and his staff for the excellent strides
that have been made in recent years in
the field of placement and training of
recreation personnel. The article is ust
one instance of the contributions that
are being made by the Association.

T. E. Rivers

There isn’t time to prepare a full report for this issue of
RECREATION on the one hundred packed, inspiring, and I
hope helpful, days which Mrs. Rivers and I spent as am-
bassadors of recreation, in the name of all recreation work-
ers and friends in the United States, to the leaders and
peoples of twenty-two European and Middle East countries.
A brief report must serve for the time being. .

The purposes of the trip were, I believe, generally ac-
complished: interchange of recreation information, promo-
tion of the International Recreation Congress, helping to
implement the Cooperative Community Exchange Project,
urging formation of national recreation associations in the
several countries, and the possible federation of these na-
tional units into an International Recreation Association.
From ragged children in Arab refugee camps to royalty we
proclaimed the “chance to play” as the right of a child and
a source of enduring satisfaction for youths and adults. The
response and cooperation which we received in carrying
out specific objectives were beyond our expectations.

Scandinavia’s interest in and provision for certain aspects
of recreation are phenomenal. Sven Salén, Sweden’s great
industrialist, will be on our International Advisory Com-
mittee. In Finland, land of sports and week-end gardners,
Urho Saariaho, member of Parliament, came to our plane
and thanked us again for coming to his country.

In Germany, from 10:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M., some sixty
leaders brought together by the Ministry of Education from
all over West Germany faced frankly how our ideas and
plans might help in the rebuilding of Germany. George von
Opel, German industrialist and sportsman, is to be our com-
mitteeman from Germany.

In England, where we had a glorious week as guests of
the National Playing Fields Association, the climax was our
reception at Buckingham Palace. Accompanied by Admiral
Norman, we were received by His Royal Highness, the Duke
of Edinburgh, who has given active leadership to the rec-
reation movement in England.

The chairman of our dinner meeting in Holland said:

often get. We like this one. You can count on our coopera-
tion.”

In Yugoslavia—a new nation struggling with many prob-
lems, economic, political and social, wavering between the
East and the West—we found a real hunger for international
contacts and a deep desire to learn all that would help in
their work for children.

In France, in accord with the historic pattern, the recrea-
tion program follows many lines, political, religious, eco-
nomic, and ideological; but the volume of recreation is tre-
mendous—fifteen thousand amateur groups, for instance,
performing fifty thousand plays a year. At a memorable
luncheon in the shadow of Sacre Coeur on Montmartre, we
recognized the contribution of the National Council of
Youth, the League of French Teaching, and the work of the
French Government. Deep appreciation was expressed for
our presence and for bringing together these great forces
for recreation in France.

In little Belgium we were told that when two Belgians

meet they form an organization. We saw iiles of twenty-two
thousand private associations of all kinds of purposes but
all more or less recreational.

On the balcony of the Capitol in Rome, Mayor Rebec-
chini pointed out the historic spots of ancient Rome below,
told of his plans for recreation in modern Rome, and ex-
pressed the hope that his reelection might make it possible
for him to attend the Philadelphia Congress.

General Katsotas, mayor of Athens, Speaking earnestly
said: “Pe0ple who spend their time and energy and tech-
nical knowledge getting the people of the world working
together on this problem make me closer to them. I know
your work is important. I will back your ideas in Greece.”

At an audience in Istanbul with His All Holiness Athena-
goras, Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church, we pre-
sented a copy of Howard Braucher’s Treasury of Living.
He opened it, read aloud a few lines from “America Has
a Song,” then said, “That is beautiful. This is the real Amer-
ica. She does have a head and abundant resources, but oh,
her real greatness is her heart and her song. God bless you
and God bless America. I shall treasure this book. It will

continually remind me of the soul of the American people.

May your leadership continue to bring the nations of the
world closer together. I know recreation will help.”

Refik Koralton, chairman of the National Assembly in
Turkey, said, as we parted: “We will ponder what you have
told us. Thank you for coming to Turkey.”

In Teheran, our farthest point east, as guests of Iran we
were privileged to share in the forwarding of a national
recreation movement under the chairmanship of Prime
Minister Hussein Ala. In an audience with His Majesty the
Shah in the Jade Marble Palace, that perfect example of
Persian art and architecture, he thanked us for our help to
Iran and spoke with personal knowledge of the deve10pments
under way and with conviction of what recreation could do
for the youth of Iran. Later that same afternoon, Mr. Ala
barely escaped an assassin’s bullet.

Fired by the hot stream of liquid gold that flows from
newly discovered oil, Baghdad in Iraq is a cauldron in which
ancient cultures are being streamlined for twentieth century
living. The youthful eyes of His Majesty the King gleamed
as we outlined our hopes for recreation in Iraq. He expressed
his hearty approval of what we were doing and gave his
assurance of Iraq’s cooperation in the international recre-
ation movement.

For five days in Jordan we experienced superb Arab hos-
pitality on all social levels from villages to the royal palace.
We had our eyes opened to one of the most valiant struggles
for social welfare we have ever seen. His Majesty King
Hussein Ibn Talal greeted us with outstretched hand. “You
are welcome. Jordan is your country while you are here.
I have heard about your mission. Let me know if there is
anything we can do. Our resources are small but we have
an asset in our people, and we want to be counted among
the nations working for the people’s welfare.”

I still glow when I think of what we saw and felt in Egypt.
In that ancient land of the Pharaohs a revolution is in prog-
ress which is kin to a religious revival. It was a stirring
experience to work with those young men and women so
conscious of their role as nation builders and so clear that,
this time, the people’s welfare is the goal and that recreation
is one of the essentials.

To our friends here and there and everywhere our heart-
felt thanks! Your support, your cooperation, your readi-
ness to look ahead and work in unity give promise of build-
ing another great instrument for enriching the human

spirit. I

 

MAKE A WISE INVESTMENT

In times like these, invest in boys and girls. Men talk about buying
stock at the bottom. When you invest in a boy or girl, you are always
buying at the bottom. You are sure that the youngster is growing up,
and there is no telling how far.

I invite every man and woman in the world to take a Hyer in
Childhood Preferred. I predict a great future for this security. It
has investment merit combined with the most exciting speculative
possibilities.

) NEW YEARBOOK UNDER WAY: A com-
prehensive inventory of our country’s
public park and recreation resources is
being undertaken by the National Rec-
reation Association. Unlike its previous
yearbook studies, the present survey in-
cludes state and federal park and recre-
ation services, as well as those of local
and county agencies. The question-
naires which have been mailed to local
and county authorities were pfepared
after consultation with a large number
of leaders in the recreation and park
fields. The cooperation of every indi-
vidual or agency responsible for public
park and recreation service is essential
in order that the fiftieth anniversary
yearbook may present a complete and
accurate picture of the present status of
the movement. Early return of the com-
pleted questionnaires is therefore ur-
gently requested.

) BOATING WAS HAILED AS A FAMILY
SPORT at the recent Motor Boat Show in
New York City. Exhibits included not
only power boats, but sailing boats as
well. Many firms are producing sturdy,
lightweight trailers which can be hitch-
ed behind the family car to carry the
craft from one lake to another. Accord-
ing to the New York Times, the num-
ber of Americans engaging in boating
soared from 20,000,000 to an estimated
30,000,000 in the last year, making it
an important contender as the world’s
most booming Sport. (See “The Mod-
ern Marina,” page 80.)

} PRIVATE SWIMMING POOLS are now
common, particularly in regions of
moderate climate. Dr. Harry A. Bliss,
of the University of California at Los

“Angeles’ School of Public Health, there-

fore asks the question, “Is the mush-
rooming of these pools throughout the
nation posing a public health prob-
lem?” The public pool water, usually
controlled from a public health stand-
point, is bacteriologically equivalent to
drinking water, but there is no means of
controlling sanitation in private pools.
Dr. Bliss suggests that the only answer
is through construction regulations and
the education of owners. Could not
public recreation departments institute
public education projects?

Grass-Roots Theatre—U. S. A.

Everyone is getting into the act in community playhouses.

 

IN 1952, a new furnace was needed by growing tree of American culture.

a church in Hyde Park, Vermont
(pop. 1291). The minister suggested
that the money be raised by putting on
an operetta, and added, “This will bring
everybody together in one big, con-
certed effort.” There were hardly
enough pe0ple to staff a performance,
let alone to provide an audience. But
rural tradition holds in Vermont—if a
family home burns or a barn needs
raising, the neighbors rally round: The
Hyde Park church needed a furnace; so
the neighbors—in this instance, three
other towns in the county—rallied to
the cause.

The show played for three nights to

capacity audiences drawn from the sur-

rounding countryside. The church got
its furnace, but the story didn’t end
there. The grOUp went on to found the
Lamoille County Players, and has since
produced many plays. They rehearse
and perform in the long-empty Hyde
Park Opera House, which the village
gives them for a dollar a year.

The Lamoille County group is by no
means unique. In towns and villages
from California to Florida, from Maine
to the Rio Grande, similar community
theatres have made their appearance,
adding a lustily blooming branch to the

FEBRUARY 1956

It all started in the early 1920’s when
theatre enthusiasts, professional and
amateur, organized the “little theatre”
movement to bring good drama to areas
far removed from Broadway. Some of
the resulting groups, such as the Pasa-
dena and Dallas playhouses, have since
become nationally famous, both for
their excellent productions and as try-
out stages for aspiring actors. But,
meanwhile, and especially since World
War II, the movement has expanded to
include grass-roots, doI-it~yourself the-
atre groups.

No longer is Broadway the only voice
of the American theatre. Last season,
from October 1954 to April 1955, New
York City’s thirty-two legitimate thea-
tres produced only seventy plays and
musicals. During the same period, in
contrast, an estimated 6,000 produc-
tions were put on by some 2,000 com-
munity theatres, including both the
semi-professional little theatres and the
lesser-known but equally active ama-
teur groups. In California, alone, there
are 147 community theatres; 60 in
Washington, D. C., and vicinity; 106
in New Jersey; and 40 in Westchester
County, New York, only an hour’s ride
from Broadway. .

All over the United States people
have discovered the thrill of a live show,
the joy of active participation and the
mysterious, vibrating empathy between
actor and audience which cannot be
achieved by the movies or TV screen.
In a community theatre the actors are

A community theatre is a strictly non-
commercial undertaking of enthusiastic
people who have found in it a refresh-
ing new experience, an Opportunity to
create intelligently and cooperatively.
Whoever takes part in it soon finds him-
self under the Spell of its law of compen-
sation: what he gives in time and effdrt
comes back many times in pleasure, new
friends, and added interest in life.

The great variety of skills needed is
one of the community theatre’s greatest
appeals. I found it all strikingly summed
up in the bulletin issued by one of them:
“If you like to hammer, saw, paint, use
a typewriter, tile a floor, sell subscrip-
tions, read scripts, turn up hems, fuss
with a wiring system, handle a make-up
kit, if you have a station wagon, design
and build scenery, like to act and, alto-
gether, are a little crazy, come right
over—we have a job for you.” As many
as two hundred persons may contribute
to a community production. In five
years at the Alley Theatre in Houston,
Texas, 4,200 people participated in
thirty-seven plays.

In a community theatre, especially,
“the play’s the thing”; and there’s prac-
tically an inexhaustible supply and vari-
ety to choose from. One publisher,

great variety of skills needed is part of the community theatre’s appeal.

Samuel French in New York, offers
5,000 plays with casts ranging from
two actors (such as the Broadway hit,
The Fourposter) to thirty or more.
Community players ordinarily like to
have fairly large casts so as to give as
many persons as possible a chance to
share the limelight.

Mister Roberts, with a cast of nine-
teen men and one woman, has been a
recent favorite. During World War II,
Clare Booth’s The Women, featuring
thirty-five women and no men, was, by
necessity, much in demand. Such out-
standing American playwrights as Eu-
gene O’\eill, Thornton Wilder, and
Tennessee Williams are high up on the
lists of community theatres whose am-

use of a play, theatre groups pay an
average royalty of $50 for the first per-
formance and $25 for each repeat. This
may not sound like much revenue for
playwrights, but it adds up. The popu-
lar comedy, You Can’t Take It With
You, has earned about $250,000 in

royalties from community productions.

After the play has been chosen comes
the casting. In hundreds of newspapers
across the country, notices like this can
be found: “You can’t act? How do you
know? Come to a tryout and find out!
Tryouts for Eugene O’Neill’s comedy

we can’t afford the horses.”

Community actors soon learn to

take everything in their stride, even the unexpected, shattering crises.

Ah, Wilderness! Friday night from 8 to
9:30 at the Little Theatre. Needed:
three men, two women in their forties;
two men in their late twenties; two men,
two women about twenty; a boy and
two girls fifteen to eighteen.”

Tryouts are open to anyone. No ex-
perience is needed, and people turn up
in amazing numbers. Frequently new-
comers in town find the theatre group '
a means of getting acquainted.

At Lake Charles, Louisiana, Rosa
Hart, who converted a former stable
into one of the nation’s most active com-
munity theatres (and has been its di-
rector since its inception eight years
ago), tries to cast neighbors in their
real-life roles. When she needs a mail
carrier she gets her own postman, com-
plete with uniform and mailbag. When
she needs a judge she gets a real one
from the courthouse. All of Lake
Charles’ 41,000 people are potential ac-
tors and the town loves it.

Community actors learn to take every-
thing in stride. In one production of
the Kalamazoo (Michigan) Civic The-
atre, a well-known physician played the
part of an American Indian. One day,
ten minutes after the curtain had rung
down on the matinee, Chief Sitting Bull,
in full make-up, answered an emergenCy
call at the Kalamazoo hospital, delivered
a baby girl to a somewhat startled moth-
er, and was back onstage at the play-
house for the evening show.

There are always crises to test an
amateur actor’s skill at improvisation.
One man I know was supposed to open
a safe onstage but it wouldn’t open.
While the watchers backstage tore their
hair, the actor calmly turned to the
audience and asked: “Is there a lock-
smith in the house?” As the laugh sub-
sided the gracious gods of the theatre
rewarded him: the safe door miracu-
lously sprang open, the show went on.

The ambitious program of the Spar-
tanburg (South Carolina) Little Thea-
tre illustrates what can be done. It pro-
duces four plays a season in a theatre
seating about five hundred, usually in-‘
cluding a comedy or two, a serious play
or a suspense drama, and perhaps a mu-
sical in which the players cooperate
with the loCal symphony orchestra and
glee club. Rehearsals and technical pre-
parations for each production require

RECREATION

six nights a week for at least a month.
Each show runs for four nights, to ac-
commodate the 1,500 subscribers.

Even a smash hit cannot be exploited
beyond that: after live weeks of theatre
work members have to heed the cry of
temporarily deserted spouses and chil-
dren. There may be other compelling
reasons: after a successful run of Mister
Roberts, one midwestern community
theatre announced that “in spite of
numerous requests the run cannot be
extended because our leading man can-
not postpone his business trip to Chi-
cago any longer.”

Spartanburg subscribers pay $5 for
a season ticket—$1.25 for each of the
four shows. (Some theatres charge less
than a dollar per show, if one buys a
season’s subscription.) The $7,500 paid
by the subscribers almost balances the
budget. What additional money is need-
ed comes from patron memberships.
Major expenses last season: $1,075 for
royalties, $3,000 for the director and
two scenic designers—the only paid
members of the staff. Since no profit

is made, community theatres have been
relieved of the twenty per cent federal
amusement tax.

With ingenuity and determination,
community theatre people have created
for themselves an amazing variety of
playhouses. The group in Raleigh,
North Carolina, transformed an old
state-fair race track into a drama center
with money, material, and work con-
tributed by three hundred patrons and
thirty civic organizations. The Gold
Coast Company of Monterey, Cali-
fornia, plays in a 105-year-old saloon.

A When the home of the Antioch Players

of Yellow Springs, Ohio—an old opera

house—was closed by the fire inspector,

they found an abandoned foundry that
had a wide-open, unobstructed span and
a huge overhead crane. Boldly they de-
cided to make the foundry a really “flex-

ible” theatre. '
Neither a stage nor seats were built
into the hall. The 315 seats are mounted
on twenty-one sections. The stage is
made up of platforms measuring six by
eight feet. Seat sections and stage plat-

    

 

forms can be moved freely by crane and
can be placed either on the floor or on
scaffolding which permits the stage
floor and the seats to be at any height
the director wishes. Thus all types of
staging can be created by simply mov-
ing seats and stage platforms: the tra-
ditional proscenium, the Elizabethan
stage, the theatre-in-the-round, or the
vast space of the old spectacle play.
With the crane a four-man crew can
make any desired shift in four hours.
The community theatre has taken
roots in American soil. A vigorous
cultural do-it-yourself movement, it
aims not at material gain but at creative
expression for thousands of pe0ple, at
friendship and c00peration, at a genu-
ine community 'spirit and a richer life.
Nothing could more fully express the
spirit behind all this thriving activity
than the thought that was expressed by
Dr. William E. Upjohn when he pre-
sented the city of Kalamazoo with its
beautiful civic theatre. “This place,”

he Said: “should be dedicated to the
happy use of leisure.” I

Firming the Foundations

From an address delivered at the
Northwest District Recreation Confer-

ence, Boise, Idaho, April, 1955.

LETTER was recently received by

the chairman of this meeting, ex-
plaining why its emphasis was placed
on recreation for the grade-school child.
I am interested in the mild implication
that this topic needed any explanation
or justification, or that it might not be
of vital interest. . '

Since when does any organization,
or department, or business or industry
have to justify, or explain, or apologize
for making better plans for the bulk of
its consumers? Ask a hundred people
in any community, “What is recrea-
tion?” and ninety-eight will answer,
“Playgrounds.” Ask them, “What are
playgrounds for?” and they’ll say, “For
the school kids.”

We in the recreation profession have
worked for years to broaden this con-
cept. We have worked so hard and so
long that there is real danger in our
having forgotten our early original ob-
jective—playgrounds and recreation
programs for children. There is danger
that in adding new floors to the grow-
ing skyscraper of recreation our orig—
inal foundations may not be strong
enough to sustain them. We built well
in those early days, but no foundations
last forever, and any good building
needs frequent and thorough inspection.
Firming the foundations of recreation
is highly important today. It is also
highly needed. One of the first things
a small child learns as he plays with
his blocks is that there comes a time
when one more block added to the pile
makes the whole pile tumble.

From a simple program of sandboxcs
for children, we have become Big Busi-
ness. Magazines like Fortune, Life,

MISS MUSSELMAN is head of the Nation-
al Recreation Association Pro gram
Service and is secretary to the new NRA

reation Programs and Activities.

Business Week, Time, and the Saturday
Evening Post carry stories about the
eXpanding leisure-time market and what
it means to our economy.

From the contributions of a few
wealthy philanthropists, our movement
has expanded into a vast tax-supported
network costing over $269,000,000.
Our nation is studded with parks, play-
grounds, athletic fields, golf courses,

'beaches, other outdoor and indoor rec-

reation areas and facilities ——-— which
have grown from a simple little sand-
pile in Boston.

Let’s give a thought to the increase
in the range of public recreation pro-
grams. From that early sandbox pro-
gram for small children, our recreation
programs now are aimed for every age-
level and for almost every situation. At
conferences, we divide into groups on
separate floors of that recreation struc-
ture—the pre-school floor, the hospital
floor, the old-age floor, the industrial
floor, the handicapped floor, the girls”
and women’s floor, the sports Hoor, the
specialty floors for music, drama, arts,
crafts, and dancing, the rural Hoor, the
college-training floor, the teen-age floor
——and all the many other floors and sub-
fioors that for one reason or another
we have added so rapidly and so dra-
matically.

We haven’t met so often lately down
in the cellar—down among the founda-
tions. And yet the strength of each of
those new floors depends, and will de-
pend, upon how strong the foundation
is——-how well we succeed in our recre-
ation program for grade-school-age
children.

Just so we don’t forget that our play-
grounds and their programs represent
the bulk of our work, let’s look at the
record, as Al Smith used to say. The
1955 figurcs aren’t in yet, so the latest
figures arc for 1950, but jive years ago
there wcre 14,747 outdoor playgrounds
——morc than all the softball diamonds,
the tennis courts, the wading and swim—
ming pools, the baseball diamonds, ath-

lctic fields, handball courts and picnic

areas, day camps and indoor centers.

The total number of leaders employed
was 58,029. How many of these were
full-time, year-round leaders ? Only
6,784. Most of those other 51,000 work-
ers were playground leaders, employed
for the summer only! And part of that
huge army of 52,982 volunteer leaders
helped on the playground.

One of the nice things about growing
older is that we lose our need for con-
formity. Twenty years ago I’d have
been afraid to get up here and say that
the weakest part of our programs is the
one we ought to be strongest in—our
original, foundation-making program
for elementary-school-age children. On
the other hand, twenty years ago I
wouldn’t have seen eno ugh, heard
enough, read enough, and th ought
enough to see our prOgrams objectively
in terms of what they are and what they
could be.

Recently, I visited my own home-
town. My very first job was as play-
ground leader in the first summer play-
ground program the town had ever had,
The town has grown considerably since
then. It has a swimming pool now, a
teen-age center, a nature museum in the
park, and.several more playgrounds. It
conducts many specialized activities I
never had as a child——-but the play-
grounds are not one bit better, in lay-
out, design, size, facilities or program.
In fact, some of the new ones aren’t as
good, because they are hot and dusty,
without enough shade. In other words,
recreation there has grown and ex-
panded—but in side shoots, not the
main stem.

Could it be that we for too long neg—
lected the other community groups like
older adults and teen-agers, and so we
have had to swing so far in their direc-
tion lately that we are almost out of
sight of the 'school children? Actually,
these other groups are, in the real mean-
ing of the word, minority groups! In
most communities, the grade-school
population outnumbers the teen, or
adult, or older adult population. It has

RECREATION

the majority, but often gets the least as
far as thought is concerned. I think it
is because we’ve accepted it so thor-
oughly that we don’t argue and discuss
it any more—and so we lose the chance
to experiment, try new ideas, learn new
techniques, such as we’re doing in hos-
pital recreation, older adult programs,
service club programs, and so on.

We have got by with this lack of pro-
gress because our communities, too,
have accepted recreation for grade-
schoolers as important, have become
used to seeing playgrounds, and don’t
question these programs as they do the
newer ones. And so we are not chal-
lenged to prove our work, and therefore
become static in it.

If the same thing happened in one of
our new “showcase programs,” we’d
soon hear about it. But with the grade-
schoolers, we’re working with a group
that will accept anything, try anything,
do anything, if given the slightest
chance! Play is the most important ele-
ment in their lives. If we don’t provide
the best, they accept what we do pro-
vide. If we don’t provide anything,
they go ahead and play just the same——
in the backyard, the street—wherever
they find each other. John Dewey was
aware of this characteristic when he
said, “The two dominant impulses of
youth are toward activity and toward
some kind of collective association.”

From what these youngsters learn
about body skills will come the athletes
of high school and college. Do we do
much in teaching how to catch a ball,
how to jump, slide, fall? No, mostly we
just let them jump, or hop, or fall—-

Children are bulk of our consumers. Five
years ago there were 14,747 playgrounds.

 

and the ones with natural skills get mosr
of our attention, not the ones who need
to learn the skills. And a large and
alarming bulk of our young men are
found to be physically unfit.

From these youngsters who learn—
or don’t learn —— about winning and
losing, will come the high school groups
that riot over a basketball game, who
tear down the goal posts at the football
game, who as adults will riot over a
hockey game by professionals and
throw bottles at the umpire at big league
baseball games. From what they learn
about nature will come their interest in
camping, in hunting, in conservation.

If they get the feel of clay, metal,
wood, leather; if they get the feel of a
hammer, saw, paintbrush, drill; if they
learn to look at things, and wonder, and
hnd out — as teen-agers and adults
they’ll flock to you for more.

Because they come, because they
laugh and play, we sit back and feel
good. If we sat back and really did some
good, stiff, analytical thinking, we’d be
shocked! I think we’d find that the pro-
grams we’re conducting today are pretty
much the same as the ones we conducted
twenty-five years ago—_—and life today
is very different. Progress has been
made in terms of equipment and what

"we know about design and layout of

facilities. Our new schools are a far
cry from the conventional, formal class-
rooms of twenty-five years ago. Our
standards of training are higher, but
our standards of program aren’t much
better. In other words, a big and im-
portant part of our public recreation

program is still in the horse and buggy

age, when it should be jet-propelled.

By and large, the after-school and
the summer playground programs
throughout this country are not good I
There are exceptions to this, but just
take a walk around the playgrounds in
your own community! How many are
really inviting-looking? Read your an-
nual report as though you’d never heard
of it before! Watch your leaders as
though you’d never seen them before.
Look at your newspaper releases as
though you’d never read them before.
Watch your amateur shows, listen to
your community singing, talk to a
stranger on the street. You’ll find, in
many, many cases, that what are opti-
mistically called playgrounds are hot,
dusty, poorly-planned, poorly-located,
poorly-equipped areas, with very little
in the way of beauty. The equipment
(what there is of it) is poorly located.
It probably needs painting. The slide
gets so hot in the summer that the kids
can’t use it. The toilets, if there are any,
are badly located. The water fountain,
if there is one, is too high, or it is mud-
dy around it, or it is cracked. There’s
no fence around the area, or else the
fence is broken. There is no sign, no
flag, no bulletin board, no shelter house,
no storage space for equipment.

To such areas, when school is out in
the summer, we assign playground
leaders. We try to assign at least two
—-—a man and a woman—to each. And
we say, “Conduct a rich, well-rounded
program. It should include all sorts of
games and sports, special events, story-
telling, music, dramatics, dancing, arts
and crafts. Plan for the adults, too—

The story hour. Note the children’s faces. We ask our playground leaders

 

to “conduct a rich, well-rounded program,” give youngstch “full value.”

neighborhood and family nights. Plan
square dancing, trips, nature programs.
Organize leagues, conduct tourna-
ments.” And in our reports we say
three thousand children attended the
playgrounds this summer, at a cost of
one quarter of a cent per child.

Whom are we trying to fool? There
isn’t one person among us who doesn’t
know that it is completely and utterly
impossible to conduct any sort of art
or craft groups without the proper tools
and equipment, without adequate sup-
plies, without a place to 'store, a place
to sit, and something to work on! And
there isn’t a person here who doesn’t
know that the craft program should em-
phasize originality and self-expression,
that is should teach new skills, and lead
on to other skills and interests; and we
know that making a hundred identical
molds, or cutting fifty black cats out
of orange crates, using a ready-made
stencil, is doing nothing for the child
except keeping him busy learning bad
work habits and developing poor taste.
Yet how many playgrounds have really
good craft instruction or are providing
adequate SUpplies?

The same holds true with other activi-
ties. So it goes. The playgrounds and
the summer program take up a big slice
of the‘recreation budget —— but the
youngsters don’t get full value.

Why is it? It’s easy to say “lack of
adequate budgets,” but budgets, as a
whole, are larger than they’ve ever
been. It’s easy to say, “lack of adequate
leadership,” but there are more leaders,
their salaries are higher, and their train-
ing better than ever before. These are

all factors, of course, but not the pri-
mary reason.

The primary fault is complacency.
We take playgrounds, and programs for
elementary school children, for granted.
There’s an interesting statement that
“every man is a prisoner of the age he
lives in,” and, as prisoners in ours,
we’ve been content to accept certain

concepts in recreation that now need
study and revision.

We need to go down into the cellars
of our profession, and into the cellars
of our programs, and firm those foun-
dations. We need courage to see with
eyes that are not blinded by habit or
complacency or fear. We need to ques-

61-

tion our work. We need to look beyond
the casual successes, the special events
that succeeded, the sports events that
made the front page, the human interest
story that made the town smile. Those
are important, but they’re not the foun-
dation. In fact, they can be masks that
hide the fact that there isn’t much of a
program!

We need to eXperiment. When should
a playground be open? Should they all
be open at the same time? Would Green
Street Playground be better if it were
limited to teen-agers? Should Worth
Street Playground take only youngsters
up to ten years old? How successful
would an all-girl program on Wednes-
day be? Could this playground be
turned over to the PTA to operate?
Could that playground specialize in
creative dramatic and rhythmic activi-
ties? Should arts and crafts go indoors
at a central location? What percentage
of the elementary-school-age children
register in the playgrounds? What hap-
pens to the others? Should leaders train
parents and encourage backyard play?
Why are so many youngsters so easily
tired, physically unfit? Are we neg-
lecting the big-muscle activities? Would
older leaders work out better on a cer-
tain playground? Is it more effective
for leaders to come to the children or
for children to go to leaders in special-
ized activities? Wh at do the play-
grounds offer that is really adventur-
ous? Is it better to have one or two well-
equipped playgrounds with a number of
leaders, a more concentrated program,
open a longer period each day, or more

playgrounds with shorter, less concen-
trated programs?

These may sound unimportant. Yet
what are the answers?

More important than such factual ex-
periments is a need for real effort to
learn what might be called “applied
recreation”—to find out and under-
stand how to select and use games and
other recreation activities best suited
for the wholesome growth of the child,
as an individual and as a member of
society. We need to learn to analyze
the values that are hidden in every ac-
tivity, so that we can fit the activity to
the child, not the child to the activity.

We all know that no one man and one
woman placed on a playground, given

a moderate amount of pre-service and
in-service training, moderately super-
vised, are going to be able to accom-
plish very much with a large playground
population. And right there is one place
where we fail.

We are eXpecting the humanly im-
possible. Very few summer playground
leaders are trained and equipped with
the necessary skills to be all things to
all youngsters. Each leader is going to
gravitate to the activities he or she
knows and likes best. A leader is not
likely to try storytelling, or story dra-
matization if he or she has never tried
it and knows nothing about it except
from books. The same goes for dancing
of all kinds, for art, for crafts, for mu-
sic. And sending a specialist in once a
week for an hour or two is helpful, but
just scratches the surface.

I think we forget sometimes thatgiwe
don’t have to do all the work! Some-
times it’s wiser to provide the oppor-
tunity to the wonderful people willing
to help, who are available in every com-
munity. They have to be found, trained
in general procedure, given specific
jobs at specific times. They work best
when they are bound together in some
sort of organization —Volunteer Par-
ents, Volunteers Unlimited, Leaders Bu-
reau, and so on.

We must recognize and anticipate
change —— new habits, customs, tradi-
tions and tastesHand be ready to meet
it. Manufacturers of breakfast foods,
of clothes, of cars, keep a very keen ear
open for new trends, new fads, new in-
terests, and base their advertising ap-
peals upon them. They watch what peo-
ple wear, where they go, what they do.
A move to a suburb to them may mean
a new station wagon, or a gasoline lawn-
mower, or a washing machine. To us,
it should mean a new playground, a new
school, a new child population that will
need a new program.

We must see that the values of yester- 7
day are not discarded; but we must also i i
see that its mistakes are nbt perpetu-
ated.

And always, in making sure that chil-
dren get our finest efforts, we must keep
in our hearts Carl Sandburg’s words:

There is only one child in the world,
And the child’s name is ALL children.
There is only one Maker in the world,
And His children cover the world,

And they are named All God’s Children.

CHILDREN are children wherever they

are—and they always love a circus,
even in South America! A youngster-
sponsored, youngster-performed circus
in the Caracas, Venezuela, YMCA has,
therefore, been a great success for the
third consecutive year. The money
raised in 1954 went toward the building
of a new kitchen at the camp which is
used by all groups participating. The
two previous circuses made possible the
construction of the camp water system
and two eight-bunk cabins.

Fourteen different groups from six
different sections of the city provided
the performers. Some of the youngsters
came from the “Y” program in three
parts of the city where the average fam-
ily income for seven‘ peOple is less than
eighty dollars per month, and the “Y”
members pay nothing or about fifteen
cents per month. Other participants
came from families whose comparative
classification would be “rich.”

Many languages were spoken. In ad-
dition to Spanish, there could be heard
English, Italian, French, German, Portu-
guese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Hun-
garian, and Romanian.

At two-thirty in the afternoon, the
gates were opened for admission to the
sideshows and skill games. There were

the performers had the fourth side so
that they, too, could see the acts.
Almost on the dot of 3:45 P.M., the

Junior Hi-Y and Junior Tri-Hi-Y.

Almost two hundred different young—

it a circus which had good publicity

Emergency
Measures

The Floods Came . . .

Devastating scenes of ruin in Waterbury, Connecticut, as
well as other towns in the hard-hit Naugatuck River Valley
last August 19, were widely circulated by press, movies, and
TV following the sudden, catastrophiqgood which struck on
that date. Mi

The group work and recreation agencies in Waterbury
were presented, within days after the Hood, with the unex-
pected project of speedily setting up a recreation center,
almost in the midst of the ruined area, so that confused and
dislocated youngsters could be taken care of for long hours
of the day. Many of these youngsters had, in the days im-
mediately following the Hood, been of great help to those
who were frantically trying to bring order to the area. As
the days passed, and adults arrived from other parts to take
over and organize relief work for the bereaved and afflicted,
the young people were no longer needed.

The idea for the center was first suggested at a meeting
on coordination of Hood services held by the'Waterbury
Community Council on August 26. At that time, a member
of the Red Cross Division of Disaster Services said that
community agencies could be of assistance by providing a
planned program of recreation for children and teen-agers
in the evacuation area, a section of Waterbury known as
Brooklyn. Irene A. Walker, executive director of the local
YWCA, took charge of the program. On her committee were
representatives of all group work and recreation agencies
in town, as well as of the park and the school departments.

In the Brooklyn section was a former public grammar
school, Begnal School, which had served the community in
many ways since it was abandoned in the 1930’s. Most re-
cently, the Waterbury Branch of the University of Con-
necticut had been using it, but was slated to move its branch
to a new location. Miss Walker got in touch with university
authorities, requesting that Begnal School he made avail-
able. They were quick to see the need and Speedin began
vacating the building.

On September 6, the committee moved its equipment into
the Begnal School and the hastily-organized center was
ready for business on the following day. Leadership was
provided by the local agencies; and volunteers from the
Parent-Teacher association supervised registration and
other activities. Equipment was obtained from a great vari-
ety of places: the park department gave tables; the school
department gave chairs; members of the Congregational
Church in nearby Middlebury contributed games and toys;
the New Britain YWCA helped out with a supply of card
tables, table tennis equipment, records, and games.

More than three hundred and fifty boys and girls took ad-
vantage of the program, becoming regular patrons of the
center during the weeks it was open. They had a fine time

at their temporary center; but, with the coming of cold
weather, heating the school became an expense which the

committee could not bear. Also, the group work and rec-
reation agencies needed their staffs back to work full time in

their home buildings. So the center closed its doors at the
end of a month.

But the story does not end there. The mothers of the area
got together to plead with the agencies to set up a permanent
center for the young people. Early‘ steps have already been
taken in this direction and, even without a formal set-up,
teen-age programs, dancing instructions, and limited activi-
ties for all age groups are being held in the Brooklyn section.

Needless to say, both municipal and private funds in Wa-
terbury have suffered much from the liood damage. For
that reason, enthusiasm has to be tempered with restraint
when it comes to offering recreation services. However,
community council representatives feel that the success and
know-how gained at the Begnal School emergency recrea-
tion center during the disaster period can be used as a strong
foundation for building toward their goal.—-—MARY O. LEON-
HARD, newspaperwoman working for the Waterbury Re-
publican and the Waterbury American and one of the vol-
unteer workers at the emergency recreation center.

After a Hurricane . . .

Last year, when Hurricane Edna unleashed her vicious
assault on the Eastern seacoast she saved some of her worst
violence for the potato country of northern Maine. Flood
and wind damage in Presque Isle resulted in about $10,000
damage to the community’s major playground area. High
winds and driving rains played havoc with the tennis court,
softball and baseball diamond, swimming pool, brook, bas-
ketball court, and the bathhouse. People slept and ate at the
community recreation center. ‘

The Community Association, the sponsoring agency for
the recreation program, immediately organized an “Opera-
tion Fix-Up” for the following weekend. Contributions of
labor, equipment, materials, and money were requested. “If
you can’t help shovel out, please shell out!” was the motto
of the project.

No exact count was kept of the business leaders, truck
drivers, insurance men, service station operators, and others
from all walks of life who pitched in to repair the havoc.
Food provided by merchants and civic groups to feed the
volunteers included twenty pounds of hamburger, dozens
of rolls and doughnuts, and gallons of coffee.

Equipment and men from the Presque Isle Air Force
Base gave a big assist to the community effort. The equip-
ment was made available through Colonel Frank  O’Con-
nor, commanding officer at the base, and the airmen volun-

teered their services during their off-duty hours. WH-

FEBRUARY 1956

 

A Success ul
WHEELING MST

Larry Callen

ORK, MUSIC and fun are the ingredients which provide
w rhythm on wheels for an immensely successful roller
skating program at a suburban New Orleans playground.
From the mere germ of an idea in the summer of 1954 and
a handful of interested youngsters, it has grown to a present
enrollment of oVer one hundred. So great has been the re-
sponse that membership in the classes has exceeded the
facilities available.

It was about a year and a half ago Mrs. Walter Post, a non-
professional skating enthusiast, volunteered her services to
Dave Scheuermann, director of recreation for Jefferson
Community Center and Playground District No. 5. A class
in fundamental skating was organized and held on the out-
door asphalt basketball courts. Thirty-live enthusiastic boys
and girls made up that first group, meeting once each week
from 6 to 7 P.M., for instruction by Mrs. Post, her husband,
and their teen-age daughter, Betty. Students practiced to
the tune of recorded waltzes broadcasted over the play-
ground PA. system. Records were bought second-hand;
and, thus far, this has proved to be the only expense incurred.

In addition to classes, the group sponsored outdoor skat-
ing parties once each month, extending invitations to skaters
of all ages—and mom and dad were often seen skating in
time with the music, hand in hand with son and daughter.

By September the enrollment had increased to sixty-five,

and classes were transferred to the paved tennis courts.
Students had been showing such rapid progress that a gala
skating show was planned, and two months later the “Wheels
Follies of 1954” was presented with some nine hundred
spectators sitting in the bleachers on a brisk November
evening.

With the assistance of many other adult volunteers, cos-
tumes were made and scenery built at the community center.
Colored lights, spotlights, and a fine program made the
show a big-time production. Acting as mistress of cere-
monies Mrs. Scheuermann, wife of the recreation director,
also outfitted with skates and colorful costume, announced
each act with an appropriate ingle.

The first number, “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” a
pantomime set to music, was followed by the “March of the
Toys,” presented by the youngest skaters, the three- to
seven-year-olds. Then, as the music slowed and softened in
tempo, an eight-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy glided
out on the huge concrete “stage” in waltz time.

The music was varied. A Hawaiian dance was performed
by some of the older girls, a Dutch number by eight- and ten-
year-old girls. Shifting to a Latin beat, Betty Post, daughter
of the instructors, offered a rhumba; then the music moved
back to waltz time and a young teen-age couple gracefully
performed the “Skater’s Waltz.” A comedy act by two local
boys, and a spotlight appearance by a top flight performer
from neighboring New Orleans, rounded out the program.
Following the show, deserving students were presented with
perfect attendance pins in the shape of a tiny skate.

Only a week after the review, registration was opened for
a new class, and 104 potential skaters, ranging in age from
twenty months to twenty years, responded.

The boys and girls were shortly working on steps to be
used in “Wheels Follies of 1955,” for October presentation.
With this sort of advance preparation, the success of the
second edition was inevitable.

Now, on two afternoons each week, two of the paved tennis
courts are turned into a roller skating rink. On one after-
noon advanced students are instructed by Mr. and Mrs.
Post; and on the other, beginners receive fundamental in-
struction with the help of the advanced, teen-age volunteers.

Colorful costumes now add to the brightness of the ses-
sions, with the girls dressed in short red skirts, blue tights,
and white blouses, the colors of the playground. All cos-
tumes are provided by the children themselves. Each child
is taught skating fundamentals, consisting of inside and
outside edges, and three turns. After mastering these, he is
put into the advanced group and taught free style skating.

Recently a skating club, The Wheeling Post, was organ-
ized. It consists of a division for skaters and one for parents
interested in obtaining funds to secure a regular skating
rink for the playground}

It took only an interest in skating, a smooth skating area,

and some second-hand records to put rhythm on wheels at
the Jefferson playground. I

RECREATION

 

 

THE ABOVE name was chosen for the
club when, in October, 1953, Mrs.
Betty Evans Griswold * organized a pre-
teen-age activity for boys and girls be-
tween the ages of ten and twelve years.
Through the Santa Monica Recreation
Department, she obtained the free fa-
cilities in one of the department’s build-
ings~—f0r each second and fourth Fri-
day, from 7:00 P.M. to 8:45 P.M.

A short announcement in a local pa-
per explained the proposed program
and its objectives; namely, to present
a wholesome introduction to social
grooming and adjustment for the pre-
adolescent in a fun-while-learning ex-
perience. It stressed that parent coop-
eration was necessary and urged all
parents to attend a committee meeting

to work out the details of the program.

The activity was offered to any and
all children in this age-bracket, the only
requirements being a call from the par-
ent to register the youngster and the
payment of a small fee at the time, of
attendance. The fees are used to defray
costs of refreshments, decorations,
prizes, an occasional orchestra, the
dance instructor, membership cards,
and so on. The dance instructor em-
ployed was selected not only for his ex-
cellent ability to teach dancing, but
principally because he was able to im-
part social etiquette equally well.

An overwhelming attendance of one
hundred and twelve youngsters on Open-
ing night necessitated the formation of
a second group, which meets on the
first and third Fridays of the month. As
of January 1, 1955, a capacity enroll-
ment of the combined groups included
approximately two hundred children,
and an ever-growing waiting list. Since
its inception, Guys and Dolls has en-
rolled approximately five hundred boys.
Whenever a child drops out, one on the

for such an activity. She conducts it as a vol-

rector of recreation—during her off-duty time.

waiting list may join. However, if a
boy leaves the group, he must be re-
placed by a boy, as it is essential that
the boys and girls be even in number.

Boys are required to wear coats and
ties; the girls, their “prettiest.” Correct
behavior attitudes and social customs
are introduced to them painlessly. As
each new group is started, they are re-
lieved of self-consciousness by pre-party
activities, such as group games or mix-
ers, before the dancing begins.

During the dancing period, we in-
troduce a change in pace to eliminate
any tenseness, with sudden suggestions
such as: “All the brown-eyed boys
choose blue-eyed girls,” or, “Boys with
brown shoes dance with girls wearing
white socks.”
“Boys with ties choose partners with
flat heels.” At the conclusion of each
dance number, the boys are reminded
to thank their partners for the dance
and escort them to seats. When tagged,
during a tag dance, by someone not of
their choosing, the children are in-
structed to accept graciously. The grand
march lines them up for the refreshment
table, which permits the boy to serve

To those remaining,

his partner.

After attending three times, young-
sters are given a membership card,
which they are requested to bring with
them when attending a club activity.
The card has spaces for name, address,
phone number, and a parent’s signature.
This not only serves as an identification
card and gives them.a sense of belong-
ing, but serves to keep any trouble-
makers in tow. They are remindedthat
it will be no trouble at all to relieve
them of their membership card and to
give it to one of the many children wait-
ing to be enrolled. This occurrence has
been so infrequent as to scarcely merit
notice—as the atmosphere, decorations,
proper dress, good organization of the
program, and the “fun” involved pre-
sent reason enough for conducting

themselves properly.

 

At each meeting, two parents station
themselves on either side of the entrance
and accept the small fee as the Guys and
Dolls file in. All intake and outgo of
monies is recorded, as well as the at-
tendance. We require one parent to be
present for every ten children.

The surplus in the treasury is utilized
during festive times of the year, or on
special-event days. At Halloween, the
costumed youngsters are given a num-
her as they enter, and door prizes are
awarded. At Christmas time, instead of
our usual pop and cookie refreshments,
we have fancy punch and Santa Claus
cookies or ornate cup cakes, as well as.
two spectacular Christmas trees and an
appropriate gift for each child. A ten-
piece band is also provided several
times a year.

Words of praise for this activity and
for the children’s progress in social ad-
justment and improvement have poured
in. Spectators are always in evidence
outside of the glassed-in areas of the
building, watching with approval and
appreciation. The following comments
are typical:

0 “This activity gives proper training in so-
cial behavior to these pre-adolescents so they
can accept responsibility of_ teen-age years and
carry on successfully to adulthood.”

o “The self confidence and poise this program
has glven to my youngsters is amazing.”

0 Teachers have called to say, “The children
in my class who belong to Guys and Dolls

have improved tremendously in school be-
havior.”

By request of the mothers and club
members, the program has gone on
without interruption all during the sum-
mer months for the past two years. As
an extra-curricular activity, a wienie
roast, with games and prizes, has been
included. Last summer, an extra activi-
ty for the group was offered at the mu-
nicipal swimming pool and, with the
help of the recreation department,
swimming races were conducted.

In addition to learning dances, these
little “Guys and Dolls” have acquired
social ease, manners and poise that
would befit any model teen-ager. l

First American Youth Hostel
Northfield, Massachusetts

American Youth Hostels held its
twenty-first birthday celebration in De-
cember.in New York. It was a gala oc-
casion with youth hostel councils from
many parts of the country represented,
and three days of informal reunions of
houseparents, youth hostel committee
members, local council representatives,
national board and national council
members, former trip members and
leaders, and hostel members at large,
as well as representatives of schools,
camps, church groups, settlement
houses, and other youth-serving organi-
zations.

Justine J. Cline, executive director
of AYH, reported that the membership
increased nine per cent in 1954 and
eleven per cent in 1955. He said one
of the most significant developments in
the organization at this time is the move
to secure AYH-owned hostels in key 10-
cations in the United States. This devia-
tion from the pattern of the past, which
involved locating hostels on property
OWned by individuals and other organi-
zations, was necessary in order to make
permanent certain key hostels and to
avoid the discontinuance of hostels for

70

such reasons as change of ownership
and illness or death of houseparents.
The organization is now working on a
five-year plan to develop more hostels,
councils, and hostel groups throughout
the country.

Girl Scout Week

“This is Our Town”—emphasizing
the local history, traditions, customs, in-
terests, and contributions to the Ameri-

Girl Scout Week, March 11-17. March
12 is the anniversary of the day in 1912
when Juliette Gordon Low called to-
gether the little group of girls who voted
to set up a Girl Guide unit—the birth
of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. In most
communities, Girl Scout Week is cele-
brated in day-by-day Observances de-
signed to dramatize the interests, ob-
jectives, and achievements of Girl

Scouting.

Camp Fire Girls Week

Camp Fire Girls will celebrate the
forty-sixth anniversary of that organi-
zation during the week of March 11-18.
The slogan for the 1956 National Birth-
day Project is “Plant Seeds . . . Reap
Friendship!” In keeping with this and
with their motto “Give Service,” Camp
Fire Girls will send packets of seeds to
several countries in the Far East.

IN MEMORIAM
Mrs. Willoughby Rodman

Mrs. Willoughby Rodman, revered
as the “Mother of Los Angeles play-
grounds,” died in December at the age
of eighty-eight.

A lifelong leader in the public recrea-
tion movement, Mrs. Rodman worked
tirelessly for the establishment of play-
grounds in Los Angeles. She carried
her message to civic organizations, and
her campaign was crowned with suc-
cess in 1904- when Los Angeles became
the first city in the United States to es-
tablish a separate municipal recreation
department.

Mrs. Rodman was appointed the play-
ground and recreation commission’s
first president in 1904-,presided over the
group until 1912, and was a member
of the commission until 1923. Her in-
terest in civic affairs was undiminished
by her retirement from the commission,
and her wise counsel has been available
through the years to scores of recrea-t
tion leaders from every part of the
world.

Natural materials collected by “desert wanderers” be-
come lovely objects. A craft director escorts each group.

Basic Planning

Purpose: To provide a creative activity that does not nec-
essarily end with the completion of the initial program. On
the desert field trips, the men derive hours of constructive
pleasure for themselves and others by gathering natural
materials from the surrounding area, bringing them back
to the post craft shep, and transforming them into beautiful
and useful objects.

Preparation: The space required for such a program is
any area where specific natural materials may be found.
The time involved includes a full day from 8:00 AM. to
6:00 RM.

Materials needed are pick and rock-axes, shovels, saws,
rope, chain, plenty of food and water, extra gas, first aid
kit, mineral light, vehicle tool kit, and spare tires.

The funds necessary for a simple but hearty lunch come
from the service club regular monthly budget for food and
refreshments. The lunch is prepared and packed by the
directors, and the club provides containers of coffee and
cooled fruit uice. The trip participants take their own can-
teens filled with water.

Transportation is obtained from the post motor pool
through an official request. The amount of transportation
needed is determined by the number who sign up in advance
for the proposed trip.

Enlisted and civilian “veteran desert wanderers” assist
the service club and craft directors in planning the trip, and
also act as guides.

Cooperation between the post and the civilian community
is necessary for a successful program. The local gem and
mineral society suggests areas where raw materials can be
found in bountiful supply and also distributes interesting
brochures concerning “Pebble Pup” activities in the area.
Standing invitations to join the society field trips and to
attend meetings are extended to post personnel. In turn,
society members are invited to join in the post trips.

Publicity: Posters announcing the field trip are placed
in the service club, mess hall, and headquarters buildings.
information about the activities appears in the service club
column in the post paper. Verbal invitations are extended

service club and post craft shop tend to draw interest when
the men see what they can do with the raw materials gath-
ered on the trip.

Entertainment: Occasionally someone may tuck a bar-
monica in his pocket and bring it out during a break to en-
tertain the group with a tune. On some expeditions music-
ally-talented members bring guitars, fiddles, ukeleles, or
other instruments of this type. It’s always fun for the group
to sing as they ride through the desert to their destination.

Execution of Program

On all trips a reliable enlisted man acts as guide. He also
sees that the vehicles are properly equipped for desert travel.
One club director or the crafts director—or both—accomu
panics the group. The field trip has always gone smoothly,
with perfect 000peration from all concerned. Participation
by enlisted personnel indicates that this outdoor type of
program is well suited as a special group activity for men
and women in their off-duty hours. Civilians stand ready

to give excellent suggestions on new areas for trips and
occasionally oin a planned expedition.

Evaluation

In Relation to Purpose: Field trips encourage the men
to gather their own natural resources. Their own special
projects in the craft shop bring them hours of pleasure as
they transform the raw materials into objects they can use
and enjoy.

Reaction of Enlisted Men and Women: Those who go on

these trips are enthusiastic and delighted with their dis-
covery of the beauty of the desert.

Attendance: As few as five or six and as many as thirty
to forty have participated in the trips.

Recommendations

The club directors urge outdoor field trips in all areas,
for the natural craft materials which can be found, because
they encourage creative craftwork, and they give the men
an opportunity to appreciate their surroundings. W

Tumbling is a hne outlet for youngsters’ needs for strenu-
ous activity. It develops physical skills, emphasizes timing,
balance, and muscular coordination, requires teamwork—
and inevitably devel0ps an increasing amount of self-disci-
pline and self-confidence.

It is fun for both boys and girls, can be co-recreational,
and interests the non-athletic as well as the athletic. It is
capable of progression and can be used in building up co-
ordinated programs of circuses, demonstrations, shows,
pageants, festivals, and carnivals. If it’s not on your pro-
gram, you’re omitting an. excellent activity for a wide age-
range.

THE TEACHING of tumbling was started in self defense!

N ow the tumbling program set up by Bill Long is used
as a model for new recreation workers in Louisville, Ken-
tucky.

At present, director of municipal athletics in Louisville,
Mr. Long began work as assistant in a small recreation
center which had no gym. Surrounded by children explod-
ing with energy, he set up mats in the center’s game room
and began to teach what he calls “tame tumbling or safety
stunts.”

He had no special tumbling background when he started
the program, although he had been on the track and fencing
teams while a student at the University of Louisville. He
obtained much of his information from the city’s recreation
library.

“At first I was just a couple of steps ahead of the kids,”
he says, “but I remembered to stress fun and safety.”

As he continued teaching, he became more proficient in
the activity, adding features and testing ideas. He stressed
safety so well that the only injury over a three-year period
was to an overanxious boy who skidded down the mat and
skinned his nose. .

OBicials were so impressed with the way in which the
class was organized that Mr. Long was asked to write down
his experiences in beginning tumbling for possible use by
new directors. Even today he makes no claims as a tumbling
expert, but he has had a chance to work out a safe, fun-

"TUMBLIN G”?

John Meehan

laden tumbling program for the eight-to-twelve-year-old set.
The program he designed is not meant to teach tumbling as
an art, but rather “to give 'maximum enjoyment to the chil-
dren and to boost a child’s confidence by means of individual
achievement.”

The outline of general instructions for this program
stresses the need for absolute control during actual instruc-
tion. The tight rein of the teaching period is varied by hav-
ing a free play period during each class.

Before any class can be held the children must become
interested in it. This was stimulated by getting out the mats
one day when the center was crowded and starting a game
of “follow the leader.” After using the most basic stunts in
his role as “leader,” he asked the children if they would like
to learn more about these tricks.

Theochildren responded enthusiastically, so a class was
scheduled for the following week and they were reminded
during the interval which followed,-before the meeting date.
He feels that it is incorrect to expect children of this age to
remember a new activity from week to week.

The few special rules set down for the class were that all
children must either wear socks or gym shoes—no child was
allowed to tumble barefooted—and both boys and girls were
encouraged to wear “blue eans” and asked not to eat within
a couple of hours before classtime, nor to drink water im-
mediately before or during class.

The Program Class by Class

FIRST SESSION

Thirty minutes: Instruction in form of executing forward
and backward rolls. '

Thirty minutes: Free play.

The gradual introdution of a new activity will build last-
ing interest. Throughout the program, new activities are
mixed with more familiar stunts.

SECOND SESSION

Thirty minutes: Repeat demonstration of rolls. Repeat
until each child in the class can do them reasonably well.

Fifteen minutes: Begin work on the headstand. Children
react well to this stunt because it gives them a chance to
show off. '

Fifteen minutes: Free play.

The three exercises learned were stressed in the first two
classes, because they are the foundation for any advanced

75

work. It is best to take extra time in mastering these three
exercises if it is necessary.

THIRD SESSION

Omit time intervals. Size of class will determine how long
it is necessary to work on the different exercises.

Repeat: Forward roll, backward roll, headstand.

Introduce: Cartwheel.

If class is large, announce that there will be an examina-
tion the following week to form beginner and advance
classes.

FOURTH SESSION

Four points for each exercise; four exercises. Forward
roll and backward roll: one point for approach, one point
for execution, one point for follow through or “come out,”
one point for proper exit from mat. Headstand and cart-
wheel: grade only on execution. '

Using this standard, every child will receive some points;
there will be no “Bunkers.” Students with very low grades
are put into the beginner’s section, but it is stressed that
they still have a chance to get into advanced group.

FIFTH SESSION

Beginners: Meet one hour. Practice form of first four
stunts. Vary with some free play.

Advanced: Meet for forty-five minutes. Introduced to
team exercises like pyramid, shuttle-roll and dive-over.

After class children are told that they may put on a tum-
bling Show if they desire. This suggestion always brings an
enthusiastic agreement from the children.

SIXTH SESSION

Beginners: Choose some of the more accomplished chil-
dren to be in show with advanced group. Help others work
on basic exercises, stressing to them that they can advance
after more practice.

Advanced: Repeat all exercises of past weeks. Outline
tumbling Show and have class run through exercises as they
will be used. Also pick several clowns. This is an excellent
way to use some of your poorer tumblers. The clown obs
are always popular and children will not be unhappy when

 

selected for this spot.
It is advisable to schedule one or two practice sess10n:

for the show during the coming week.

SEVENTH SESSION
Dress Rehearsal: Girls and boys wear blue jeans, whit:

shirts of any kind, and dark socks or gym shoes. Stres
correct form as you have children run through Show abou
three times. (Mr. Long found it gave the children a “bi;
league” feeling when he used a stopwatch.) Stress need 0
absolute quiet backstage, and be generous with the praisl
to build self confidence.

Have set of directions and order.of acts typed and postec
in several places backstage before the show.
EIGHTH SESSION

First Tumbling Show:

Each tumbler does two forward rolls across stage.
Each tumbler does two backward rolls.
Each tumbler does a headstand.
Cldwns appear, do silly stunts.
Cartwheels done by five.best tumblers only.
Team dive through pyramid.
Dive over one, two people.
Clown does fake dive over entire class.
9. Double pyramid. All on stage for curtain.
NINTH SESSION

Class attendance will rise after Show.

Beginners: Start to learn stunts that were executed in th
show by advanced group.

Advanced: Begin more diflicult stunts as team heat
stands, shuttle-roll dives, dive through headstand, and trip]
jump roll.

Program from this point on depends on needs of you
group. Leader must decide when to hold a new exam c
show. To maintain interest of advanced students, team ac
tivities should be stressed.

he is allowed to add his brand to the class corral. That’s

RECREATIO

" Growth of a Baseball Association

A successful plan for the
promotion of baseball.

WHAT an organization can do to stim-
ulate interest in a sport activity is
illustrated by the development of the
Union County (New Jersey) Baseball
Association. The U.C.B.A. has success-
fully adhered to its objective: to pro-
mote baseball on youth and adult levels.
The idea of a baseball association was
first originated in 1941. After a com-
mittee of baseball-minded “people had
conducted “Hot Stove League Dinners”
from 1937-1941, to stimulate the great
national pastime and honor the league
champions and outstanding players of
the county, they felt there was a need
for a baseball organization to actually
promote many activities for the better-
ment of the game. They little dreamed
that the baseball association would
grow into the operational unit that it is
today.
‘ During the first year, the association,
aside from running the annual dinners,
conducted a baseball school for boys, a
rules interpretation clinic, and an “old
timers” game. It was now destined to
expand. In 1945 it inaugurated one of
its biggest projects, the Youth Baseball
Leagues, with the aid of sponsors from
civic and service clubs. From an eight-
team league in 1945 it has grown into a
forty-three-team program of live leagues
of boys from nine to sixteen, which is
operated with paid, competent super-
visors, umpires, and score-keepers. The
Union County Park Commission as;
sumes the financial responsibility of
leadership. From 1945 to 1955 there
has been a total of 339 teams consisting
of 5,476 players with a grand total of
1,884 games being played.

Hall of Fame

In 1952 the association embarked on
another fine project, the Union County
Hall of Fame. This program has met
with p0pular approval. A Hall of Fame
Committee each year selects ten candi-

dates to be voted upon by fifty peOple
who represent the background of base-
ball in the county for the last thirty-five
years. The two candidates receiving the
highest number of votes each year, pro-
viding they receive twenty-five per cent
of the total first place votes cast are
elected. A candidate’s selection is based
on his contributions, achievements, lead-
ership, sportsmanship, services in re-
gard to organizing leagues, conducting
tournaments, baseball instruction, clin-
ics, and promotion of the game. The
candidate must live or be employed in
Union County.

The thirteen baseball men who were
the honored guests at the annual Hot
Stove Baseball Dinners were voted into
the Hall of Fame as the “originals.” To
date there are twenty-three members.
The outstanding feature of the Hall of
Fame is that it is local in character.
Players who played sandlot ball with
club and industrial teams over a span
of years have an opportunity to be
honored. A few former major league
players are shrine members but they
played considerable baseball in their
home county. '

Those elected reveal that it is one of
the finest tributes that they have ever
received. They are deeply touched that
an organization has remembered their
diamond achievements and has selected
them to be honored by placing their
name on a permanent Hallnof Fame
plaque, compiling their record in a
book, and presenting them with a plastic
enclosed certificate of their membership.

Letters received from some read as
follows: “I am thrilled—I just cannot
explain how happy this makes me feel
and I will cherish the plaque for the

rest of my life.” Another: “I will re- '

member this forever. I am now retired

George T. Cron

from business and have a lot of time to
look back to my playing days.”

The Veteran’s Memorial Trophy

In 1954 the association established
a new award, The Veterans Memorial
Trophy, in honor of the players in the
Union County League who lost their
lives in the service of their country. It
goes to the outstanding rookie in the
first year of organized ball. The idea
is to give encouragement to a young
player trying to make the majors.

In addition to the above, the associa-
tion provides approximately Iifteen tro-
phies to outstanding players and teams
in the county at its annual Hot Stove
Dinner. About four to five hundred
baseball players, fans, umpires attend
the dinners. Baseball stars who have at-
tended are : Joe McCarthy, “Hank”
Borowy, “Mule” Haas, Fresco Thomp-
son, Chuck Dressen, Joe DiMaggio, Phil
Rizzuto, Frank O’Rourke, Eddie Mad-
jeski, Frank Bruggy, Gene Hermanski,

burn, Monte Irvin, Frank Shaughnessy,
Gil MacDougald, Al Mamaux, Ray Ken-
nedy, Paul Kritchell, Earl Harper, Bill
Brandt, and Joe Collins.

* * ‘I

Aside from the paid supervision of
the youth leagues, the other projects of
the association are conducted with vol-
unteers from the association. The youth
and adult leagues in Union County are
having outstanding seasons and, in all
probability, it can be traced to the ac-
tivities of the U.C.B.A.

Similar associations in the counties
of the nation could keep baseball in the
limelight as the greatest national pas-
time, and introduce the “Hall of Fame”
to keep coals Haming in the hot stove.-

Recreation in Industry

What’s For Lunch at Your Plant?

Do people just “hang around” during lunchtime, or have

you extended your recreation program to include facil-

ities for the midday break? Here’s what some firms do.

OU’RE a recreation director with a
Y sports and recreation program that’s
humming. Day and night shift workers
are involved in one activity or another
after work or before work. You have
leagues galore, clubs, exhibits, dances,
shows. You’ve done a solid job and
you’re justifiably proud of it.

But comes lunchtime and you see
large groups of employees “just hang-
ing around” with nothing much to do.
Some, who like to play cards and have
managed to get hold of a deck, are
playing their favorite game. Others
standbehind them and kibitz. But most
of the people are doing nothing.

Because you’re the kind of person
who takes a professional pride in doing
your job as well as humanly possible,
you are bothered. What can you do to
provide activities for pe0ple who may
have anywhere from half an hour to an
hour for lunch? How can you round out
your otherwise excellent program?

You Have Company

You are not alone in your concern
with this problem. It is one which has
plagued—and been solved by—others
in your position. The problem has, in
fact, been a source of enough concern
to General Motors for a number of bul-
letins to be sent to the various GM
plants discussing it and offering sug-
gestions for activities.

“A well-planned recreation pro-
gram,” one bulletin notes, “should offer
full recreational opportunities whenever
the employee is not working. Whether

he takes advantage of those opportuni-
ties is not the primary responsibility of
the director. He is the provider. If an
activity clicks with the employees, it
stays in the program; if it fails to ap-
peal, the activity may be dropped, but,
at least, the director has tried.”

It goes on to suggest a number of

ing will get play.”

Informality should be the general
rule observed by the recreation direc-
tor in planning lunch-period activities,
“Very little should be done in the way
of scheduling.”

Movies and perhaps home-talent en-
tertainment are a possibility for the
lunchroom, adds the bulletin.

Often, the GM directors are advised,
the informal play provided for lunch
periods leads to requests for the forma-
tion of league play. And since this cuts
down the number of players and in-
creases the number of spectators, the
director will have to weigh this ques-
tion carefully when it arises.

A final note to the GM directors is
the suggestion that when participation
in a particular lunchtime activity tapers
off, the facilities for it should be with-
drawn, at least temporarily, and an in-
teresting substitute provided.

GM is by no means the only company
which has tackled ——- and solved -—— the

.lunch period recreation problem. And

the activities which are being made
available are unusually varied.

Becoming a Trend

Other major automobile manufactur-
ers have recognized the problems—~and
the opportunities —-.- presented by the
lunchtime hiatus in employee recreation

activity. Big aircraft manufacturers'

have similarly done something about it.
Cards appear to be the most popular

of the mealtime activities, at least by,
volume, since there are adherents of

rummy, bridge, euchre, blackjack,

many others as there are known card
games. Dartball is another popular
game, widely used because no great
space is required to play it and because
many games can be in progress simul-
taneously in various parts of a plant.

In some plants, the aisles are utilized
for setting up quoits games. Notable
in this respect is the National Cash
Register Company in Dayton, Ohio,
whose recreation director, J. E. Ernst,
reports that 1,200 to 1,500 employees
each day use the one hundred quoits
courts scattered throughout the plant.

In order to solve the problem of set-
ting up these courts, National Cash Reg-
ister devised removable pegs which can
be inserted'into (and removed from)
the floor plates which hold them in a
matter of seconds. The floor plates,
made of three-inch square steel, are
welded to a hollow tube which goes
down into the floor and which holds the
peg. Nails are used to define the forty-
inch circle around each of the two pegs
used in the game. Pegs are set thirty
feet apart. Second-grade lawnmower
tires serve as pitching rings. Material
used for each quoits court costs only
about two dollars.

National Cash Register is one of the
companies where dartball has become a
popular lunchtime activity. Ernst re-
ports that ten different teams «are cur-
rently playing in organized leagues, and
that it is not uncommon to see a dart-
ball team accompanied by a sizable
rooting section as it goes to another de-

partment for that day’s game. League
play is confined to three days a week
with the other two days devoted to de-
partmental play. There are about fifty
dartball boards located throughout the
factory.

Shuffleboard is another game which
requires a substantial playing area for
which aisles can be utilized. One com-
pany which has successfully tackled this
problem is North American Aviation,

"Inc., at Los Angeles, California. Here,

as at National Cash Register, aisle space
has been utilized for courts.

At Eastman Kodak Company in
Rochester, New York, the company’s

~ gym is utilized for shufHeboard, and the

sport has became so popular that an
active “Noon-Hour Shuffleboard

fourteen two-man teams in competition.

a scoring diagram at each end. Stand-
ard sets of equipment include four cues,

discs, six inches in diameter.

But with an eye to situations in which
space is more limited, one company, the
Dimco-Gray Company of Dayton, Ohio,
has devised a special set only two-thirds
regulation size which requires a court
only thirty feet long.

Other plants have provided facilities
for table tennis, which demands a sub-
stantial amount of space and requires
the setting up of a table and net.

Some firms provide a library of books
for those who prefer their recreation to
be quiet and restful, and a great many
offer chess and checkers.

At least one company, the Republic
Aviation Corporation at F armingdale,
New York, has undertaken the ambi-
tious ob of organizing a large band of
employees who give lunchtime concerts
for their fellow aircraft workers; and
several other companies offer movies,
often full-length films presented serially
over several lunch periods, sometimes
augmented with short subjects to round
out a full program.

What has been done by so many firms
to beat the lunchtime lag in recreation
activities, can be done by all of them, to
one degree or another. It takes only the
same kind of creative thinking that
characterizes the good organizer of
after-work programs to provide facili-
ties for the midday break which will in-
volve all who want to participate. I

The Modern Marina

DATING is the most important recreation today, dollar-
B wise, in the United States. Americans spend more
money on boating than on baseball, fishing, golf, or any
other single recreation. Today there is one boat for every
thirty—two persons in the United States. About five million
craft of various types are in use and more than 3,250,000
American families own outboard motors.

These facts, as well as many others relating to boating in
America, are presented in a publication entitled The M odern
Marina, issued by the National Association of Engine and
Boat Manufacturers. Valuable suggestions with reference
to the planning, financing, construction and operation of
marinas are contained in this profusely illustrated booklet.
NAEBM coined the word “marina” to designate a modern
boat basin with facilities for berthing and securing all types
of recreational craft, as well as providing adequate supplies,
provisions, and service and fueling facilities.

PLANNING THE MARINA *

What should the well-equipped marina consist of? With-
out regard to local conditions and financing, the complete
marina should provide the following: slips and moorings for
a home or permanent fleet; a smaller but none-the-less ade-
quate number of slips and moorings for transient craft;
personnel to wash down and generally assist the skipper to
service his craft when he comes in from a long day’s cruis-

club, and any other facilities ingenious operators of mar-
inas can think of to make the life of the boat owner com-
fortable, convenient and attractive. . . .

Every waterfront community is fortunate in having its
share of boating enthusiasts. Also, each community can
boast of a group of public-spirited citizens who desire the
development and beautification of the local waterfront solely
because of the“ benefits accruing to their community. The
initiation of a program for improvement of the waterfront
can normally be expected through the combined efforts of
these two groups who must be relied upon to develop the
program energetically. . . .

For a municipally owned marina, the mission to plan,
construct and manage, for fastest action and to avoid delays
or even failure, should be placed in the hands of an un-
biased body with no selfish or individual interest, but with

a determination for accomplishment. This could be the'

public engineer, or the department of parks, department 'of
public works, department of marine, or a quasi-govern-
mental body which has power to raise funds. . . . Its scope
of activity, powers, and form of organization should be
strictly delineated by the local government.

This body should be assisted by an advisory committee
composed of an active representative from each of the major
groups having an interest in the project. The over-all re-
quirements for waterfront activities within the community

should be carefully investigated, and the physical conditions .r'-

of the harbor should be carefully reviewed to determine its

adaptability. At times, it may be found advisable to employ
the services of experienced personnel to conduct such a

study and accurately evaluate the finding. In this event, 

the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers
can assist in recommending such people. . . .

Probably the most critical period in the life of a marina
is its development prior to the actual start of design and
construction. At this time such important questions as site
selection, method of financing, and legal procedures are de-

termined. The processes that are necessary at this stage can
be complicated and require detailed study before final de-
cisions are made. Furthermore, many of the elements of
this early development are closely related and may have to
be investigated simultaneously. -

A typical project might be handled in the following man-
ner: The first move would be a determination of the build-
er’s own financial resources and the availability of addi-
tional funds-if required. Concurrently he might hold in-
formal discussions with federal, state, and local authorities
concerning government requirements and permits for the
site considered. If participation in the project by govern-
ment agencies is to be sought, action should start at an
early date because such proceedings can take considerable
time. The planners might also consult manufacturers and
suppliers at this time concerning any commercial aspects
they may have in mind. All of the foregoing may proceed, at
least in part, prior to the acquisition of the site because
they are equally applicable to any site.

The remaining items of the program should proceed prac-
tically simultaneously. These items include a determina-
tion of the number and size of permanent and transient boats
to be accommodated and a complete survey of the site to
show physical conditions and the nature of structure which
will best meet the requirements. The financial and real estate
negotiations must be closed, construction plans and cost
estimates prepared, and estimates made to develop operating
costs and expected income. All of the foregoing culminate
in the applications for permits to construct and the placing
of the plans and specifications in the hands,of contractors
requesting bids on the work.

RULES FOR OPERATION OF A YACHT HARBOR
Ralph H. Shaw

In San Mateo, California, the county recreation commis-
sion maintains Coyote Point Yacht Harbor with one hun-
dred sixty berths and Peninsula Beach; picnic area with
barbecue pits, tables, slides, sanitary facilities, water; park-
ing area, sanitary facilities at Peninsula Beach with bath-
house, showers, sanitary facilities, lifeguard service (sum-
mer) , refreshment stand.

The rules of harbor Operation, as drawn up by the county
recreation commission refuse mooring permission to any
boat until a mooring license has been obtained and fee paid,
and to all boats used for commercial purposes. All fees for
such licenses are due and payable in advance, on the first
day of each month, and licenses which are sixty days de-
linquent are cancelled. Mooring licenses are not transfer-
able, and no exchange of mooring spaces is permitted with-
out prior approval of the commission.

Other rules are:
0 The recreation commission reserves the right to change
berth assignments and monthly fees, to reassign berths dur-
ing the temporary absence of the permanent occupant, and
also reserves the right to cancel the mooring license of any

Parks Progress“ in “Test Virginia

“Full steam ahead” is the cry from
the West Virginia Parks Division of
the Conservation Commission as they
announce progress on their seven bond-
revenue state park projects.

Kermit McKeever, assistant director
and chief of parks, says that Black-
water Falls State Park, near Davis—
the “million dollar baby” of the West
Virginia parks system—will probably
be opened early next summer. In addi-
tion to the lodge at Blackwater, twenty-
five new winterized cabins will accom-
modate year-round guests. The Tucker
County resort will be the most elaborate
in the state.

At Cacapon, near Berkeley Springs,

82

the new forty-eight-unit main lodge is
well under way and is expected to be
completed by next May.

At Watoga, near Marlinton, and Lost
River, near Moorefield, eight winterized
cabins have been erected and are ninety-
five per cent finished.

Mont Chateau, near Morgantown, is
the newest of the state parks—and work
has begun on an addition that will add
eighteen new rooms to the historic old
inn that the state is taking over. Here
water sports will be encouraged, and
winter sports will be abundant in near-
by Cooper’s Rock State Forest—which
adjoins the new state property.

At Bluestone, near Hinton, fifteen

cabins are under way. The fisherman’s
lodge has been completed only on the
drawing board, but Mr. McKeever feels
that the lodge and cabins will be ready
in the Spring.

At Tygart Lake State Park, near
Grafton, the state is constructing ten
cabins, and work is to begin-here just
as soon as weather permits. The cabins
will be built in various sizes for family
and vacation groups.

Work on all these facilities is made
possible by bond-revenue action of the
1953 and last session of the legislature
which allows the commission to procure
money to build parks'-—-a project which
amounts to a $3,100,000 expenditure.

RECREATION

TEN Maxims of Public Relations

G. Edward Pendray

In which a philosopher explores the “folklore” of public relations.

In twenty-five years at the practice of public relations, I
have become increasingly convinced that our profession is
an art rather than a science.

The essence_of an art is that it be guided by intuition and
imagination of a high order and by some inner mechanism
of belief and comprehension that brings the practitioner to
the right course, often without his knowing precisely how
this has been brought about.

I do not know of any attempts, until recently, to put in
written form the underlying beliefs, maxims, -or “folklore”
on which successful public relations decisions and programs
are based.* It is obvious, however, that there are a great
many of these often-expressed beliefs, which like proverbs,
represent a kind of distilled wisdom of the ages. Not only
are many beliefs subscribed to consciously or unconsciously
by the whole profession, but every public relations man also
has a few additional ones that represent his private stock-
in-trade.

Some of the maxims I have found most useful to remem-
ber, and which I believe underlie a great portion of suc-
cessful public relations thought and action, are these:

1 The better people
know you, the more
they will like you.
This maxim, of
course, is the one

that lies behind al-
most every PR pro-

 

gram. In the main,
it expresses a real truth: most institutions suffer from being
too little known, and more knowledge usually makes better
friends. It is manifestly not true, however, if the institu-
tion does not square with the public conception of what it
ought to be; therefore, the importance of the second maxim
of public relations.

2 It is easier to change yourself than to change the public.
This obviously true statement°is often the most difficult of
the maxims to put into practice. It involves confession of
error and the resolution to change; something that is diffi-
cult for an institution, or a client—and even, at times, a
public relations man—to act upon.

‘ 3 It is not enough to do right; you must also let the people

know. Many a client and institution feels that to do a good
job is encugh to gain eternal fame and glory. Obviously,
this is the first“ necessity, but experience has repeatedly
shown that unless the people know about it, the good per-
formance is in danger of going unhonored and unsung until
the end of time.

* See Public Relations Journal, January 1953, pages 8-9.

FEBRUARY 1956

 

4 Talk in terms of people’s self-interest; every man is
fascinated by the mirror wherein he sees himself. To per-
suade people, you must first interest them. If people do not

“see themselves” in your material you will never get them
to pay much attention to it.

5 People are interest-
ed first in people, then
in things, last in ideas.
The pull of a good hu-
1 man interest story is

unbeatable. If an ab-
stract idea—or a thing—is what you have to exploit, you
will fare best if you state your case in terms of people.

6 People can be counted
upon to act only when they
expect to gain something
by it. Appeals to ideals or
altruism sometimes work,
but for sure-fire results,
spell out “what’s in it for

me.”

 

7 The language of action is plainly heard, though words
may be inaudible. To convince people, take action that dra-
matizes what you wish to say.

8 Faint heart ne’er won fair reputation. In most situations,
boldness is to be favored over timidity; positive statements
and actions over negative ones.

9 Repetition is essential. The successful program should
be continued zealously, long after the client—and the public
relations department—may have begun to tire of it.

10 That log may be a crocodile. Before you start to solve
a public relations problem, be sure you know what it really
is. Check, test and see for yourself—or you may find your-
self treating the symptoms, while the fever rages on. I

For Recreation Play Directors:
Let’s take stock of ourselves!

N MOST large recreation departments, personnel problems
I —including how employees work with associates, patrons
and facilities—constitute a major concern on the part of
supervisors and administrators. Definition of duties for the
various types of recreation personnel concerned with the ac-
tivity program does not always reach the workers in suffi-
cient detail, so they do not always know precisely what is
expected of them. Change in personnel is a constant factor
and frequently a major concern. Unless new employees are
thoroughly indoctrinated and experienced workers occa-
sionally reminded of their specific responsibilities, they
cannot be expected to work at top-level efficiency nor render
the quality of service of which they are capable.

This “How’m I Doing” Chart was prepared for recreation
play directors. It is designed primarily to point up general,
and some specific, responsibilities expected of these em-
ployees. The “proper” answer to each question is “yes.”
Probably no one worker would be able to answer “yes” to
all the questions, yet the list suggests certain desirable and
reachable goals for all.« It is designed to inspire workers to
render better services and give them a quick method of ap-
praising their work. No worker is expected to turn in the
results of his own self-rating to some superior officer. No
grades are given by anyone to an employee except possibly
the employee himself. No records are kept of “marks” at-
tained. Employees may be encouraged, however, to discuss
weaknesses and/or strengths they may discover in them-
selves with their immediate supervisor or administrator. The
elimination of discovered weaknesses in a worker is the key
to personal professional growth.

RESEARCH

State Park Area Evaluation

“Suggested Criteria for Evaluating Areas Proposed for
Inclusion in State Park Systems” is the title of a report pre-
pared for the National Conference on State Parks by a com-
mittee whose chairman was K. R. Cougill, director of state
parks, lands, and waters in Indiana. The report has been
adopted by the board of directors of the conference “in the
belief that the criteria may serve as standards for use by
states.”

The report classifies state park areas under six headings
parks, monuments, recreation areas, beaches, parkways,
and waysides—defines each type, and presents detailed cri-
teria for the selection of property designed for each of these
six uses. It states: “State park systems are usually comprised
of areas of scenic, scientific, historical, archeological, or
other recreation significance of state-wide importance, or
at least of sufficient importance to attract visitors from a
large section of the state. . . . Each area should possess unique
or high quality of interest. Each system, as a whole, should
(1) conserve outstanding examples of the State’s natural
and cultural resources for the inspiration and benefit of the
public, and (2) provide non-urban recreation opportunities
for the State’s citizens and visitors that are normally beyond
the responsibility of the State’s political subdivisions.”

 

Georgia Reports Progress

According to a report of the field service and survey com-
mittee of the Georgia Recreation Society, 1954-55, the num-
ber of year-round recreation departments in the state in-
creased from eight to twenty since 1944. The annual oper-
ating expenditure showed a 520 per cent increase and the
number of year-round employees a 360 per cent increase
during the ten-year period. Thirty-four community center
buildings were constructed in Georgia communities, most

of them since 1950, at a cost exceeding $1,500,000.

Ways to Contribute to Research

At a discussion meeting at the 37th National Recreation
Congress in Denver, Dr. Norman P. Miller, associate pro-

fessor in the department of physical education, University
of California, stated: “The question of how recreation and
park agencies can make a greater contribution to the re-
search program in recreation is an important one if we are
to get the most benefit from our research efforts. There ap-
pear to be at least six ways the recreation agency and/ or
practitioner can contribute: '

1. By identifying and stating problems in the field that

require research. Problems must come from the field if rec-
reation is to progress.

2. By collecting basic data such as recording behavior as
relates to recreation experiences of participants. Case studies
would be an invaluable contribution to recreation literature.

3. By reading and interpreting the results of research.
Many practitioners need to learn how to understand and

appreciate research. .
4. By using and applying the results of research 1n rec-
reation and related fields. Recreation needs a ‘cr1t1cal’

approach. a

5. By writing simple reports of agency activity using ac-
cepted research procedures. Practitioners should learn to
use the ‘tools’ of the trade—how to state the facts and com-
municate them to the profession.

6. By cooperating with persons doing research. The re-
sources of recreation agencies, facility, personnel and pro-
gram-wise, should be made available for research purposes.

Actually, the practitioner is an integral member of the
research team, and any sound program of recreation re-
search should provide opportunities for the above processes
to take place.”

Municipal Golf Course Organizing
and Operating Guide*

{A Review)

A treatise such as this is very important at this time when
many private golf courses that could not withstand the en-

. croachment of population and high taxes are being sold or

developed for real estate purposes. The study reveals that
more golfers play on municipal courses than on any other
type of course: 1,292,100, or 40.19 of our golfing popula-
tion, play on the 765 municipal golf courses.

The guide contains a compilation of information relating
to fees, revenues, and expenditures at more than one hun-
dred municipal courses, as well as a detailed financial state-
ment for selected courses. This information is very useful
for courses already in operation. The pictures of raw land,
courses under development, and completed layouts, together
with the accompanying text, are very effective.

I have a feeling that too much detail, however, has been
given to outlining the methods whereby the operation of
individual courses have been organized, since conditions
vary from year to year and depend upon the local situation.
I assume that the purpose of the publication is to encourage
the promotion and development of new public courses rather
than to serve as a guide to their location, development and
operation.——~—FELIX K. DHAININ, Landscape Architect-Ad-
ministrative, Board of Park Commissioners, Minneapolis.

How are You Doing on Personnel Administration?

Having personnel trouble? Do things seem confused, dis-
couraging, and downright impossible? The answer would
seem to be “yes” for many employers udging from the types
of requests we have been receiving.

Nine times out of a dozen, this troubled employer is carry-
ing a headache because he is off to a bad start. He has missed
the first important step in the whole field of personnel ad-
ministration. He cannot tell us what kind of person he is
looking for—because he doesn’t know. The amazing thing
is that he doesn’t have more trouble, including losing his
job to a better qualified employer.

One is really off to a bad start when he doesn’t know what
kind of people he is seeking. So, let’s start at the beginning,
and right. What, then, is the first step? The consensus is:
study and analyze the position in question, write it up, put
it on paper. This will clarify your own thinking, make it
more definite. Not only that, but you will be able to justify,
and, if necessary, defend it in case of criticism from the
appropriating agency, the public, and even the worker who
may be hired to fill the job. The worker is entitled to know
what his job is and what is expected of him from day to day.
The ob description is a basic instrument for the recruiting
and selection of workers and for judging performance on
the job.

After we know what kind of people we want, we are in a
position to proceed, in logical order to:

1. Find and attract good people.

2. Give them what, they need in training and education.

3. Provide conditions which will motivate them with a de-
sire to work well and improve themselves on the job.

Perhaps this is a good time to suggest that administrators
periodically evaluate their personnel policies and practices.
The following suggested criteria may help you to appraise
your personnel activities.

Position Defined. As indicated above, analyze the posi-
tion and draft a specification, including such factors as:
title, major functions or duties, worker qualifications, and

salary range. This will give you and others something tangi-
ble with which to. work.

Recruiting. Use all the recruiting sources at your dis-
posal. These should include the National Recreation As-
sociation’s Personnel Service, the colleges and universities
conducting major recreation curriculums, in addition to
local and other types of sources.

 

MR. SUTHERLAND is the director of the NRA Recreation
Personnel Service.

A free mimeographed statement, How to Attract Good
Candidates for Recreation Positions,* is available from the
Association. This will serve as a guide for your recruiting
efforts, and it includes a check list of facts candidates need.

Selection. Seek out the kind of people you want rather
than select only from those who present themselves.*

Evaluate and verify applicants’ statements and investigate
references.*

Secure in personal interview what is needed to appraise
qualifications. Give the applicant the information he wants
and leave him with a favorable impression.*

Individualize and devise tests to‘ suit the particular situa-
tion.*

Promote on the basis of merit. If competent people are
not available for promotion, select from outside sources.*

Introduce new workers to their positions and surround-
ings graciously and thoroughly.*

Training. Adapt training to particular jobs.*

Provide an over-all continuous training program to im-
prove workers in present positions and to prepare them for
new and changing assignments.*

Encourage and assist employees in taking advantage of
off-the-job training opportunities that their chances for pro-
fessional growth may be increased.*

Compensation: Analyze position as defined. Evaluate
and classify it in relation to other positions.*

Review positions often enough to keep duties, responsi-"‘
bilities and requirements up-to-date.*

Determine what positions are worth and establish mini-
mum and maximum salaries for them.*

Pay what positions are worth, if possible, but, in any
event, pay as much or more than the prevailing rates in the
area if you want to attract and hold the best.*

Extra Benejits: Provide for adequate holiday and vaca- I
tion time which compares favorably or better with the gen-
eral practice.*

Allow for sick leave that will give reasonable protection '
against loss of income when people are ill.*

Assist employees in arranging for hospitalization and
surgical plans.*

Establish a sound retirement system.*

Communications: Interpret to employees their relation- i
ship to other workers, how their departments or agencies

relate to others and how their work fits into the over-all
service plan.*

Consult with employees 'when changes in policy are being '

RECREATION ‘

considered, and advise when decisions are made.*

Take workers into the planning of affairs which concern
them.*

Resolve complaints as quickly and as fairly as possible
and at the lowest level of supervision.*

Encourage ideas and suggestions from all employees.*

Plan projects, programs, activities, and social affairs that
help workers to get acquainted and to have a feeling of well

available to all employees.*

Eliminate the incompetent and undesirables kindly but
promptly.*

Discipline those who violate rules, regulations, and good
personal and professional behavior.*

Utilize exit interviews and other means of finding out why
workers leave the service, and correct the conditions that
cause costly turnover.* I

* Raybestos Wins First World Softball Title for East *

The game of softball, according to
the Amateur Softball Association of
America, had its origin in the Midwest.
There, for many years, representative
clubs in the area laid claim to the World
Softball Championship. However, the
picture was changed in 1955 when the
Raybestos Cardinals of Stratford, Con-
necticut, were crowned world champs
during the tourney staged in Clear-
water, Florida, in September. This
marked the first time in the twenty-
three-year history of the event that an
Eastern club has won this coveted title.

Raybestos Division, which conducts
one of the largest recreation programs
in industry for its employees, entered
“big-time softball” in 1948 under the
direction of William S. Simpson, gen-
eral manager and vice president of Ray-
bestos-Division of Raybestos-Manhat-
tan, Inc.’, and a board member of the
National Recreation Association.

The company’s softball program was
started with the erection of the first
lighted softball field in New England at
Raybestos Memorial Field, in memory
of the employees who lost their lives in

World War II. In addition to serving
as the home field for the softball teams,
it is used quite extensively by the Little
League and Knot Hole Club, two spon-
sored programs of the Raybestos Divi-
sion. It was not an easy road for the
club which, after eight years of compe-
tition, attained this much sought goal.
It is a well-deserved tribute to the
efforts of William S. Simpson who
brought big time softball to the East for
the first time in 1948 and in 1955
brought back the first world softball
title. I

Editorial:
STUDENTS BEST ASSETS

More and more attention is be-
ing paid to the need for attracting
students to college specifically to
study recreation. Many of those
graduated from recreation curric-
ulums have been students who
transferred from another major,
or who made a career decision
after entering the college.

An often cited influence upon
the decision of students who
choose the recreation major is
that of the student already major-
ing in recreation. Such students
are their curriculum’s best public
relations representatives, on or off
campus. They deserve the cheer-
ful cooperation of all who are con-
cerned with the future that will
be affected by the good recreation
leadership now in the making.

National recruiting, profession~
al recruiting, college recruiting—~'
all can help in influencing young
people to choose the recreation
field. These sources are truly ef-
fective, however, only while the
recreation major student inspires
young people to choose his own
professional field.

Penn State Students Recruit

Recreation major students at Penn-
sylvania State University are assem-
bling and preparing materials for a re-
cruiting drive to bring more high-school
prospects into professional training for
recreation leadership. The student rec-
reation society has chosen the drive as
a year’s project.

Arrangements will be made with vo-
cational guidance teachers for the Penn
State students to give talks on “Oppor-
tunities in the Recreation Profession”
to their home-town high schools. A se-
ries of color slides is being made as a
preliminary project. Brochures and dis-
play pictures also will be used. Forty

reation agencies of Lexington and F ay-
ette County. Part-time graduate stu-

dents are in full-time positions in com-
munity recreation, a mental hospital,
and a correctional institution. The di-
rector of recreation for Kentucky 4-H
Clubs also meets with the group.

ing the National Interest”; The Great
Adventure (produced, directed, written,
and photographed by Mr. Arne Sucks-
dorff) as “The Best Children’s Film”;
and The African Lion (Walt Disney

Productions) as “The Best Science Film

for Youth.”

RADIO: Family Theater (MBS) as “The
Radio Program Best Portraying Amer-
ica” and Adventures in Science (CBS)
as “The Best Science Radio Program
for Youth.”

Station WBNS-TV, of Columbus,
Ohio, was named “The Television Sta-
tion That Best Served Youth in 1955”;
and Station WTIC, of Hartford, Con-‘
necticut, was named “The Radio Sta-
tion That Best Served Youth in 1955”.
Each station received a scroll and won
for a high school senior in its commu-
nity an Edison Scholarship of $1,000
to be used for college education.

A special citation was made to the
American Broadcasting Company radio
network, for “outstanding public serv-
ice in making reports on the growing
shortage of scientists and engineers” to
the American people, and to The Big
Idea, a Philadelphia television program
that has presented 1,700 inventors and
encouraged “the scientific imagination
of the American television audience.”

Fifty-six national organizations, with
aggregate memberships well over thirty
million citizens, are helping to focus
national and community interest on
these Edison Awards. The purpose of
the awards program is to encourage
mass media productions that (1) make
meaningful the values of the American
tradition; (2) present heroes and ideals
worthy of emulation by children; (3)
interest young people in science and in
scientific and engineering careers; (4)
eliminate unwholesome elements.

Free Film Shows
For New York Youth

The American Film Organization, a
nonprofit association devoted to the
welfare of youth in the New York area,
has arranged programs of free motion
pictures for youth, utilizing play streets,
parks, playgrounds, churches, or any
other available area.

These free public programs are aimed

not only to attract and entertain but},

also to educate and inspire the young
people who attend. Each schedule in-

cludes a well-known Hollywood full-
length film, coupled with documentaries
on industry, geography, sports, or other
educational subjects.

The cost of six cents per viewer has
been met by soliciting sponsors like
civic organizations, religious groups,
firms, or individuals, each receiving
public recognition for their interest in
community welfare.

Children’s Film Center

An international Center of Films for
Children, to begin operation in 1957,
is planned by the United Nations Edu-
cational Scientific and Cultural Organi-
zation.

The project is an outgrowth of the
September meeting in Edinburgh of
representatives of the film industry and
of a number of organizations concerned
with child welfare. The center would
be run with the assistance of UNESCO,
in cooperation with film and child wel-
fare organizations.

Purpose of the proposed center is to
provide an international clearing-house
for information relating to films for
children and young people. Activities
will include the exchange of ideas on
production, distribution, and exhibition
of films, and the compilation of film
catalogues.

Research on the influence of films
and on the tastes of children, promotion
of national children’s film centers, and
the preparation of film versions in vari-
ous languages are other objectives of

the center as it is now planned—F CA
Rashes.

Schools Request TV Show Reruns

The Robert Montgomery TV pro-
gram which often uses script material
of a serious health, social, or educa-
tional nature, has, for the third time in
a year, created a demand for additional
public showings that has moved the
sponsor to issue extra kinescope prints.
See the Man (NBC-TV, December 12) ,
concerned a young man who overcame
his shame and embarrassment at being
illiterate and belatedly obtained the
schooling he had been unable to get as
a child.

The Johnson Wax Company, sponsor
of the show, arranged for the produc-
tion of additional prints when requests
from educational institutions passed the
fifty mark. The prints will be distrib-
uted for free showings through NBC.
The two earlier programs that resulted
in similar demands dealt with the prob-
lems of old age, as handled by a New
York institution, and multiple sclerosis,
as approached at a clinic for children in
Pennsylvania.

RECREATION

Q‘W We

Hi everybody, did you have a merry
Christmas and happy New Year? I
hope you made several resolutions: the
kind you’ll keep. I’ve made some; do
yours match mine?

1. To find more ways to promote re-
search in our field.

2. To write, to document, the things
we see happen every day to patients——
good things because of recreation.

3. To find more visual methods of
telling others of our work.

4. To enlist at least one high-school
or college student into a hospital rec-
reation curriculum.

5. To interest our surrounding com-
munities in bringing recreation to their
local hospitals which are without rec-
reation. a

ceived swell publicity: a feature picture
in every newspaper.

The result: over twenty thousand
gifts for the city hospital patients were
donated by the public.

The institute for the northeastern
area concerning “Recreation for Senior
Citizens in Hospitals, Nursing Homes,
and Institutions” is scheduled for Jan-
uary 18-20 at New York University—-
just about the time this magazine goes
to press. I’m hoping for a heavy regis-
tration for four reasons:

1. So few nursing homes have varied
recreation programs for their ill and
handicapped.

2. Quite a few, but far from all,
homes for the aged realize a resident’s
interests and morale are of equal in-
portance to his physical well-being.

3. Recreation pers onnel wonder
more and more how to program for the
aged. Obviously, it takes‘ much more
:ime to develop interest in activities on
be part of our senior citizens than in

younger folks. How do we get the time
when, more often than not, we work at
a ratio of one thousand patients to one
worker?

4. What part should the community
play in developing recreation centers
and home visits for the thousands of
non-institutionalized ill and handi-
capped senior citizens?

If only we come up with a few good
constructive ideas, we’ll have achieved
our purpose. Tell you next month about
the institute and the results of last year’s

study of the value of recreation for the
chronically ill.

Manual of Intergroup Relations

John P. Dean and Alex Rosen.' The
University of Chicago Press, 5750 Ellis
Avenue, Chicago 37, Illinois. Pp. I94.
$3.75. '

This resourceful booklet is based
upon a considerable amount of com-
pleted research in the field of intergroup
action and human relations, much of it
under the supervision and guidance of
the Cornell Social Service Research
Center. In an effort to be as specific
as possible, the authors have directed
themselves primarily to community rec-
reation and group workers. Many Of
the illustratiOns are chosen from this
general field but the types of intergrOUp
relationship problems presented and the
principles involved apply also to prac-
tices of other organizations.

A number Of individual situations are
described with an analysis Of the human
relation factors that infiuence the local
efforts to bring about desired changes.
Discussed also are the most effective
techniques and strategies utilized in
negotiations among important social,
economic, political, cultural, ethnic,
racial, and religious groups involved.
There is extensive treatment of prob-
lems and procedures pertaining to mi-
nority group participation. Supple-
mentary to the helpful discussion of the
training and growth of professional
workers or practitioners in this field is
a selected bibliography of literature on
the subject. Professional workers in
recreation and group work will find
much in this manual that should help
them in dealing with today’s important
problems of intergroup relations. —-

Champions by Setback

David K. Boynick. Thomas Y. Cro-

well Company, 4'32 Fourth Avenue,
New York 16. Pp. 205. $2.753“

We do not usually review “story-
books”—but this one is different! It
tells the life stories of ten outstanding
athletes, all champions in their fields
and all severely physically handicapped
at one time in their lives. Included are
such figures as Glenn Cunningham, Wil-
liam Bonthron and Archie San Romani,
all of track fame; James I. Braddock,
one-time world’s champion boxer;
Forbes Holten Norris, Jr., All-Ameri-
can swimmer; George Monroe Woolf,
jockey; John Hackett, football star;
Hamilton Richardson, tennis champi-
on; Charles A. Boswell, first world
blind golf champion; Martin White-
ford Marion, one of the greatest short-
stops in baseball.

These stories of courage and perser-
verance will bring a warm glow to your
heart, and encourage you to greater cf-
forts in providing recreation opportu-

96

nities for the handicapped. And the
teen-agers will read these stor1es; they
are more exciting than telev1s10n!

Preparation and Use of
Audio-Visual Aids

(Third Edition), Kenneth B. Haas
and Harry A. Parker. Prentice-Hall,
lnc., 70 Fifth Avenue, New York 11,
New York. Pp. 381. $5.00.*

The authors are concerned with help-
ing an instructor or leader transmit to
an individual or group “facts, skills, at-
titudes, knowledge, understanding, and
appreciation” through three related
kinds of devices. These are: audio—
which can be heard but not seen; visual
—which can be seen but not heard; and
audio-visual—which can be seen and

heard.

The recreation department concerned

' with interpreting programs, training

leaders, and promoting or explaining
activities will find this book valuable
for several reasons: It offers broad cov-
erage, is organized as a manual, can be
used by beginners, tells “how to do it”
step-by-step, is written in plain lan-
guage, and stimulates ideas and action.

Separate chapters deal with the black-
board and bulletin board, television,
radio, and recording, pictures and pho-
tographs, specimens and models, pos-
ters and manuals, Hash cards and flannel
boards, maps and diagrams, slides,
filmstrips, motion pictures, and special
projectors. Others list sources of audio-
visual aids and methods of evaluating
visual-aid programs.

Recreation executives will find par-
ticularly helpful the chapter titled “Per-
sonalized Audio-Visual Instruction.” In
a detailed, well-organized manner it
outlines the preparation, presentation,
and evaluation of sessions in which such
assistance is used. Audio-visual aids
are leadership aids. Recreation leaders
not specifically trained in their use will
eXperiment more confidently and get
better results with this revision of a
standard guide at hand—Alfred B.

Jensen, NRA Personnel Service.

Home Ludens—A Study of the
Play Element in Culture

Johan Huizinga. Beacon Press, Bos-
ton. Pp. 220. $1.25.

Published in Switzerland in 1944,
and only now available in English, this
book represents one of the few recent
profound studies of the meaning of
play. In his foreword, Dr. Huizinga
says: “For many years the conviction
has grown upon me that civilization
arises and unfolds in and as play. Traces
of such an opinion are to be found in
my writing ever since 1903. I took it
as the theme for my annual address as

rector of Leyden University in 1933 and
afterwards for lectures in Zurich,
Vienna, and London. The aim of the
present full-length study is to try to in-
tegrate the concept of play into that of
culture.”

In line with this purpose, Dr. Huiz-
inga outlines briefly various past theor-
ies of play and discards them all as in-
sufiicient. “It would be perfectly possi-
ble to accept nearly all the explanations
without getting into any real confusion
of thought—and without coming much
nearer to the real understanding of the
play-concept. . . . The fun of playing
resists all analysis, all logical interpre-
tation.”

Analyzing the essential qualities of
play—that it is a free activity, quite
outside ordinary life, absorbing the
player intensely and utterly, an activity
with no material interest and no profit
to be gained, proceeding within its own
proper boundaries of time and space in
an orderly manner, promoting the for-
mation of social groupings—the author
arrives at two basic functions: a contest
for something or a representation of
something.

Proceeding from this basic concept,
the author discusses play and religion,
play and language, war, law, art, phi-
losophy in the fascinating detail of
many references to history and anthro-
pology. The book strikes a thrilling
note for students of play.-—-Edna V.
Braucher, Correspondence and Consul-
tation Service, NRA.
