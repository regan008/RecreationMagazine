RECREATIOD

I Editorial l

26W
~ A Community Project

E. DeAlton Partridge

Providing an adcquate and constructive program of rec-
reation is a responsibility that should be shared by the
entire community. There is no one group of people or seg-
ment of the community that can or should assume this
responsibility alone.

It is especially important that the schools cooperate in

any community recreation program. There are a number of reasons why this is true,

but the two main reasons would seenr to he: (1) developing a good recreation pro-
gram is to a large extent an educational process; and (2) the schools have facilities
' that can and should be used for recreational purposcs.

The preparation of young people for constructive use of leisure time has long been
a major aim of education. In order to use leisure time well, one must learn new skills,
new attitudes. Extending wholesome recreational activities into all age groups requires
a tcaching and learning process. If youngsters graduate from our schools with the
proper attitudes toward recreation, and some skills that have carry-over value, then the
job of the recreation worker is greatly simplified.

The use of school facilities for recreational purposes, especially in after-school
hours, has been a practice of long standing in many communities. This is a practice '
that has a great deal of merit and should be given serious consideration by all Ameri-
can communities.

It has been obvious to educators for many years that public education is more than
a classroom responsibility. Instruction within the classroom is only a part of the total
educational program that must operate in a community. The way in which American
education is organized and administered places responsibility upon the local board of
education. In order for this board to carry out its rcsponsibilities adequately and with
the support of the public, it is good administrative practice to encourage people of all
ages to use school facilities and to become acquainted with the nature of these facilities
and with the problems of upkeep and development of new facilities. In communities
where the citizens have a feeling of real ownership and pride in their schools, it is much
easier to gain support for school programs and to deal with controversial issues which
arc bound to arise.

The use of school facilities for recreational purposes does create certain administra-
tive problems, but the fact that this kind of school use has been carried on in a number
of communities for many years, would indicate that the administrative problems in-
volved are not insoluble.

The Amcrican people have a tremendous investment in thcir public schools and it is
only fair that this investment should be used to pay dividends wherever it can, and en-
rich the life of the community. The use of school facilities to provide wholesome rec-
reational education and activity is a natural outgrowth of this philosophy.

 

DR. PARTRIDGE is president of M ontclair Teachers College, New Jersey.

TIIE UNITED WAY

The Air Force requests National Recre—

ation Association services in communi-
ties adjacent to bases where recreational
facilities are seriously inadequate. The
military needs help in training programs
for recreation leadership and an urgent
request comes from the Armed Forces
for NRA’s work with minority groups in
service. One hundred sixty-one commu-
nities ask for recreation programs inte-
grating military and civilian populations.
United Community Campaigns will en-
deavor to provide funds for these and
other vital United Defense Fund services.
Help meet these requests. Give gener-

Wives and Widows

    

Sirs:

My husband, “Pete” LaBorde, for-
merly recreation director in Viroqua,
Wisconsin, has been appointed gradu-
ate assistant at Indiana University,
where he will work toward his doctor-
ate.

I love RECREATION magazine every
bit as much as Pete does—but I think
you need a page of “Hints and Helps”
or ideas for recreation “widows.”

MRS. WAYNE LABORDE, V iroqua,
Wisconsin.

Letter to Dr. Etter
Sir:

It has been my pleasure to read your
splendid article, “Cry, The Beloved
City,” in the April issue of RECREATION.
I would like to compliment you very
highly for bringing your thoughts on
the need for preservation of park values
so forcefully to our recreation people.

For many years I have tried within
my limited opportunities to make our
park men appreciate the recreation
vieWpoint and our recreation men to get
a better understanding of the important
place nature has within the recreation
program. In the twenties it looked im-
possible but today there is a noticeable
trend to a better and more tolerant un-
derstanding. People like yourself who
have no axes to grind or who are not
biased or opinionated are doing so
much to break down this barrier. Your

article will have a very wholesome reac-
tion I am sure.

RAYMOND E. HOYT, United States
Department of the Interior, Na-
tional Park Service, San Francisco,
California.

ing the reprinting at Dr. Etter's article, for distri-

Pictures for Your Office

Sirs:

I read “Letters,” in the May issue of
RECREATION, in which Mr. Curtis asked
about getting pictures that are attractive
for his office. We have found that many
of the materials that are used in stores
can very frequently be salvaged for that
purpose. I have not done it so much re-
cently, but it can be arranged. As you
know, the stores very rarely ever use the
same ideas or pictures from year to

.Ccttcn/A

 

year. Very frequently they will plac
beautiful backgrounds or pictures i
their windows that would be adaptabl
to an office or a recreation center. Se
dom do these pictures stay in a windo‘
more than a week or two. Give this a tr]

Vandalism
Sirs:

I appreciated your sending me th
tear-sheet from your February issue (
RECREATION. Mr. Prendergast’s ed
torial in that issue, on the problem r
delinquency, is excellent and his poinl
on the subject are well taken. The art
cle should be of real value to all c01
cerned with the problem.

The mention, in “Things You Shoul
Know,” of our Key Club anti-vandaliSI
activity in New England is particular]
appreciated. You will be interested I
know that this work is expanding n:
only in New England but throughot
the entire country.

Sir:

Your choice of the Whitney Museu:
for the future home of the Nation.

foresight. I made a thorough inspe
tion of the building while enjoying t}
art exhibit. I can visualize the Associ.
tion gaining stature and prestig

torical building.

Its artistic and homelike atmosphe1
will gain new friends and prominenc
Historical embellishment would I
added by retaining the stone over tl

congratulate the new service of Recr
ation Program Aids recently introduce

RECREATIo

by the National Recreation Association.
It will supplement our department’s

program required of our community
center director and will serve as an ex-

cellent program aid for our supervisor.
Miss Musselman should receive only
praise for her efforts in this new type
of service.

I have a request concerning mem-
berships and Recreation Program Aids,
which will help us to plan for our necds
during 1954. We would like to order
RECREATION magazine for each of our
seven park and recreation board mem-
bers.

We also would like to order eight
Recreation Program Aids, each of
which would be mailed directly to the
director of our community centers in
King County. We wish to affiliate the
department again and have a Recrea-
tion Program Aid sent to the main office.

Comments on Recreation
Sirs:

RECREATION has reached a new high,
I believe. The Junc issue inspires me to
volunteer this unqualified compliment.
The quality of the publication has been
gctting bettcr and better. Its inviting
appearance, meaty content, satisfying
variety and excellcnt organization leave
little to be desired. Congratulations!

One evaluates more nearly objectively
and appreciatcs with more deliberation

'and deeper penetration at these far dis-
tances.

Sirs:

So often we are neglectful in recog-
nizing a job well done. I want to take
this opportunity to express to you thc
fact that RECREATION is a very well-
organized publication which carries a
vast variety of articles and information.
This means that it will reach each and
every person who receives the maga-
zine. It is my hope that those in the
field of recreation will become more
rcading conscious and review the ma-
~terial and information which is pre-
pared and sent to them through publi-
‘lcation channels. I feel that this would
ihave a grcat effect in eliminating a lot
“of unnecessary criticism and make the
leadership realize the potentials as well

Las the handicaps and problems found
within the field of recreation.

)A NEW COMBINED BOOK SERVICE for
friends and members, is announced by
the National Recreation Association.
For more details see page 391.

) A SUMMARY OF THE INTERESTING
MEETING on “Recreation in Correctional
Institutions,” which was held at the
Southern District Conference in Roan-
Oke in 1953, is now completed and will
appear in the October 1954 issue Of
RECREATION. A second meeting on this
subject is being held at the 36th Recre-
ation Congress in St. Louis.

) A TWO-YEAR STUDY Of Recreation for
the Aging of North Carolina has been
announced through the chancellor of
the University of North Carolina, RO-
bert B. House. Made possible by a grant
Of approximately nine thousand dollars
tO the university, given by most of the
insurance companies of the state for this
purpose, it will be directed by Dr. Har-
Old D. Meyer through the Institute for
Research in Social Science. The proj-
ect will be closely related to the activi-

ties of the North Carolina Recreation
Commission.

)A PROPOSAL FOR INSURANCE has just
been completed by an insurance com-
pany working for the NRA. The insur-
ance will cover participants in baseball,
softball and basketball conducted by
public recreation departments and other
community recreation agencies which
are affiliated members Of the National
Recreation Association. Be sure to at-
tend the meeting on “Sports Problems,”
Wednesday, September 29, at 9 :15 A.M.,
at the National Recreation Congress,
where this proposal will be discussed.

) INJURIES ACQUIRED in an employer’s
swimming pool after working hours do
not ratc compensation, according tO
New York State’s Court Of Appeals. The
court recently ruled on the case of an
accident occurring one-half hour after
the closing Of the Klett Company of
Delmar, an Albany suburb. Before this
ruling the State Workmen’s Compensa-
tion Board had considered the victim of
such an Off-duty incident eligible for
workmen’s compensation benefits.

)THE NEW SPORTS WEEKLY published
by Time, Inc., Sports Illustrated, has
been scheduled to come out the middle

392

Of August. Miss Mary Snow of the
staff,* who is responsible for a section
on weekend leisure in the new maga-
zine, will appreciate receiving story
leads from any recreation leaders who
conduct a unique weekend program.

) RECREATION LEADERS, MANUFACTUR-
ERS, ADVERTISERS, ATTENTION! The June
issue Of Fortune carried an article on
the vigor Of the leisure and recreational
market, “330 Billion for Fun.” It states
that this amount Of money is Ital)t again
as much as the American consumer
spends on clothing or shelter, and twice
what he lays out for new cars or home
goods. The article is recommended
reading for recreation leaders, and for
manufacturers Of recreation products.

) AS A PART OF THE ANTI-LITTERBUG
CAMPAIGN which is sweeping this coun-
try under the auspices Of many and
varied organizations, the National Rec-
reation Association has been working
with Keep America Beautiful, Inc.,'on
plans for a comic book entitled, Larry
Doesn’t Litter Anymore, for free distri-
bution tO recreation and park depart-
ments and schools. Keep America Beau-
tiful, Inc., is also working with the big
manufacturers Of cans, bottles, boxes
and paper containers on a formidable
campaign tO line up every industry that
contributes to litter.

An article which appeared in the
June issue of Reader’s Digest, “Are You
a Litterbug?” gives a good account of
where litter comes from and what can
be done about it.

t A NEW DEPARTMENT ON RECREATION
AND PARKS, inaugurated in American
City magazine, is being edited by
Joseph Prendergast. This periodical
reaches all city managers, department

heads Of municipal governments and
city planners.

) NOTE SHOULD BE TAKEN of an amend-
ment to the pledge of allegiance tO the
flag which is now the law. The words

“under God” have been added, so that

the pledge will now read, “one nation
under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.”

) SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEW YORK
STATE may now join with municipali-
ties in “equipping, Operating and main-
taining playground and neighborhood
recreation centers” and may “appropri-
ate money therefore,” under provisions
of an amendment to Section 244B of the
General Municipal Law, recently en-
acted by the State Legislature and

signed by Governor Dewey on April 7,
1954.

The amended law also permits mu-
nicipalities and schOOl districts to en-
ter into agreements covering propor-
tionate costs, manner of employment 01
personnel, and which may provide for
the fiscal officer of the municipality to
serve as custodian Of Oint funds.

> A RESOLUTION FROM RECREATION OF-
FICIALS in Arlington, Alexandria, Fair-
fax and Falls Church was presented tO
the Virginia Recreation Association and
the Virginia Recreation Society by
Eugene Barnwell Of Alexandria, resolv-
ing that they request that school build-
ings be assigned to recreation depart-
ments following the end Of the school
day, and that recreation departments be
permitted to present sponsored pro-
grams and schedule the areas for com.
munity use. Mr. Barnwell moved that
they adopt this resolution and that
COpies be sent to the State Department
Of Education and to as many local
boards as possible, getting news re-
leases on same. This was seconded and
carried.

Said General Bradley: “If our defense program is to be as

engaged in the program.the essential services of the United
Defense Fund agencies.

“We must see to it that the services of USO are available
to all members of our Armed Forces wherever they may be
statibned—that experienced and trained workers of United
Community Defense Services are available to help defense
towns that are trying to solve new and serious community
problems and want professional aid . . . we must make sure
that United Sealnen’s Service can set up centers for mer-
chant seamen in those foreign ports so jammed with defense
shipping that going ashore becomes a hazard, both to our
seamen and to our shipping schedules—and we must guaran-
tee that the National Recreation Association can continue
serving as a kind of liaison between our Armed Forces and
civilians by sponsoring activities in which they participate
together.”

Editorially Speaking

 

A School Issue

In this issue of RECREATION, we
emphasize school-community coopera-
tion in the provision of recreation
services for a local community. Our
object is to provide recreation depart-
ment executives and leaders with some
information as to how they can relate
to the schools in the planning of pro-
gram and facilities for the most effec-
tive community-wide services. Because
so much good material on this subject
has been submitted to us, and we want
to share it with you, some of the articles
will have to appear in future issues of
the magazine. Watch for them! If you
find the articles in this issue helpful
and enlightening, please let us know.

Buildings vs. Playgrounds

According to an item in the Public
Service Journal, Seattle, Washington,
April 1954-, social workers in New York
City have attacked the city’s plans for
multimillion-dollar recreation centers.
They maintain that smaller playgrounds
close to home mean more to children.
The New York City park department,
on the other hand, holds that the cost
of many small centers would be pro-
hibitive, and that indoor centers con-
stitute one of the best attacks on the
youth problem, because outdoor facili-
ties are usable less than half the year.

Juvenile Delinquency

0 Approximately one thousand high-
school coaches of fourteen states, from
the Mississippi to New York, attending
the University of Cincinnati’s annual
two-day football clinic, April 30 and
May 1, were reminded by Dr. Raymond
Walters, president of the university, of
their opportunity to help check the in-
creasing tide of juvenile crimes.

0 “Chaplains in the armed forces are
aghast at how many youths have but a
rudimentary sense of moral and spirit-
ual values. If integrity is the lifeblood

of the nation, then America—in spite'

of her hearths and blackboards and
spires—may well be in danger of bleed-
ing to death. For vast numbers en-
grossed iri making good, which usually
means money, life is largely a matter of
deals rather than ideals. The blot is
in the realm of ethics.”-——From “Where
Is the Blot?” by Frederick Brown Har-
ris, Chaplain, United States Senate, in

National Parent-Teacher, November
1953.

0 Leaders in the field of delinquency
prevention and control were invited by
Oveta Culp Hobby to meet in Washing-
ton in June to discuss the next steps
in “Moving Ahead to Curb Juvenile De-
linquency,” and to evaluate the effec-
tiviness of delinquenCy prevention pro-
grams that have been tried. The Na-
tional Recreation Association was rep-
resented at this meeting by Joseph Pren-
dergast, executive director.

’ place?

0 “Curb delinquency via recreation,”
says John M. Lewis of the Southern Cal-
ifornia Youth Association, “prevention
is better, and less expensive, than cure.
Let’s encourage the building of more
recreation facilities and sports areas,
and our demand for increased jails and
detention facilities will subside nor-
mally.”

o “Emphasize moral and spiritual val-
ues to build an America worthy of its
heritage of faith in God and of free-
dom.”—-From the “Action Program”
in National Parent-Teacher, November

1953.

Meet the Real Menace

Riding home on the commuters’ train
the other afternoon, I couldn’t help
overhearing a conversation between two
men who were sitting in front of me.

“I’m having a time with my b0y,”
one man said to the other. “He’s car
crazy, and he’s driving me crazy, too.”

“They’re all car crazy,” said his
friend, wagging his head wisely.

“I know,” said the first father, “but
this kid of mine is going overboard.
Last night, for example, he was brag-
ging to us that he had driven from our
house to the Loop in thirty-two minutes
through heavy traffic. Thirty-two min-
utesl That’s just plain suicide!”

“Sure is,” the other man agreed.
“Can’t you slow him down?”

“Well, I tried,” said P0p. “And do
you know what he said? He wanted
to bet me that I had made it myself in
less than forty minutes!”

“Have you?” the friend asked.

“Well, sure. But I’m an experienced
driver. This boy is just a kid.”

There you are! It’s perfectly okay
for P013 to tear along like a hot rod-
der. But let his son do it—a lad who!
has better timing, better eyesight, and
faster reHexes than Pop will ever have
again—and that lad’s a problem child.

Where did he get the idea that it’s
smart to drive that fast in the first
From Pop, the middle-aged
space cadetl When are we parents go-
ing to smarten up and realize that we
can’t ask our youngsters to act one way
while we act another?—-—Paul Jones, Na-
tional Safety Council, in “The Heel at
the Wheel,” National Parent-Teacher,
September .1953.

0 Paul B. Sears, chairman, Conserva-
tion Program, Yale University, in an
article entitled “A Nation for Civilizcd
Living” in the American Planning and
Civic Annual for 1952 stated: “For us
the joy of living languishes until our
radio can he traded in for a twenty-
four-inch television set. We eat out our
hearts for Palm Beach when a measure
of comprehension might turn our town- '
ship, even our backyard, into high ad-
venture.”

RECREATION ‘

THE AGE in which we live is charac-

terized variously by our press as
confused, pcrplexed or purposeless. Al-
bert Schweitzer, the great music critic
and philos0pher, says the man of today
is surrounded by influences bent on de-
stroying his confidence in his own think-
ing. On every side man is distracted
from creative living. He is propagan-
dized and high-pressured into accepting
what he reads and hears instead of re-
acting to it. Harry Overstreet reminds
us that our newspapers exploit catas-
trophe and that radio, movies, advertis-
ing and television pander to medio-
crity, emotional immaturity, escapism,
self-indulgence, and exhibitionism. Our
sports are spectator sports. Our amuse-
ments are vulgar, pitiful travesties of
reality.

Yet we should recognize that a change
is taking place, and happily it is taking
place in our young people. We find in
them a spiritual awakening and a spirit-
ual concern with human relations. It is
they who have, or are seeking, a sense
of direction. They are alert and alive
to the interests and stimulation that we
call creative living. We see it in their
participation in the visual arts, the
dance, the crafts, and in their attend-
ance at concerts, where they are often
the largest part of the audience.

This is encouraging, but in our homes
and schools there still prevails a mis-
taken concept of psychology that thwarts
all possible spontaneous development
of interest and imagination. This is the
erroneous idea that a child is what the
Romans called tabula rose, a blank tab-
let, on which facts and other people’s
ideas are to be inscribed. The method
of teaching based on this psychology is
to make children repeat and memorize.
This makes children insensitive to their
environment. It develops parrots, not
creative people.

The child’s mind is not a receptacle
into which we should pour facts and
ideas in order that he may pour them
back at examination time, usually in
distorted form, to show us what poor
teachers we are. No, on the contrary,
the child is an organism—a living, re-
acting, sensing being, who changes in

CHILDREN
and the Creative Life

 

Albert Sydney Raubenheimer

form and character by virtue of his
powers of moving, feeling, imagining,
thinking, reasoning and judging. The
child is not merely a creature but a cre-
ator. He actually develops ideas,
thoughts, language and feeling. He rea-

sons, he can even udge.

We put fish into water because that
is the environment in which fish thrive.
Into what environment, into what cul-
ture do we put the child that he may
develop? Culture is not something that
you hang on the wall or a record you
play or a book you read. The culture of
the child is his own thoughts about, and
his reaction to, the whole world around
him, people, nature, everything with
which he comes into contact. The crea-
tive life of a child—his interest in mu-
sic, science, crafts, or ideas—is not
something that just happens to him be-
cause we h0pefully pray that it will. It
must develop from within, with the help
of home, school and community.

If we accept this fact that the child is
both creature and creator, should we
not, then, provide for him the most en-
riching environment? We would be un-
wise if we did not want him to be asso-
ciated with people, both adults and
playmates, who are sociable, coopera-
tive, law-abiding, disciplined, stable,
interesting in conversation and capable
of sharing with him the beauties and
delight of his observations. We want
parents and teachers, through partici-
pating in the experiences of youth, to
help our youngsters broaden their
awareness of the life about them.

The culture we seek and the oppor-
tunity for the development of the child’s
creative life are at hand. We need only
the imagination to use them. If we can
think more creatively about our chil-
dren, we can not only help them to be-
come artists or craftsmen or scientists

but, what is more important, help then)
to become real persons.

In the school the creative life is not
only fun but an act of achievement.
Whatever the child is working on,
whether it be music or a foreign lan-
guage, he is trying to achieve mastery
of it. Achievement leads to a desire for
further achievement, and there is the

start of progressive development.

In arts and crafts the child is not
making a picture or a bowl; he is mak-
ing an expression of himself, of his per-
sonality. And you must accept his repre-
sentation as being what he says it is, no
matter how little it may look like it. As
the child works and plays with other
children he is learning the social arts——
the give-and-take of social living, the
rules of the game, a concept of law.
Finally, he is reaching for self-realiza-
tion. He becomes uniquely himself, a
personality different from every other.
He is able to be himself, to think and
act for himself. That is what we covet
for our children and our people. We
want them to have a sense of direction
and to have integrity.

Let us take a moment for a brief look
at our leisure time. Frankly, leisure too
often means stagnation for adults and
mischief or delinquency for children
and youth. But leisure should be crea-
tive living. It should be used fruitfully

to pursue our Interests. Think of what

interest in their youth or middle years
might mean now to the aged, with their
pathetic burden of useless time!

In the last analysis we ask that the
creative life of the child develop free-
dom of spirit, of thought and of judg-
ment. And we ask that such freedom be
a disciplined freedom. Viewing the child
in the light of his actual being as a crea-
tive organism, let us work together to
develop that freedom. .

1‘ he question may be asked, “Why
do we need community programs of recreation anyway?”
Those who have answered this query point out that we have
become increasingly an urban, industrial nation. Many peo-
ple have moved away from the natural out-of-doors oppor-
tunities for enjoying spare hours. Others have seen real
estate developments take away their rural freedom. Even
long-time, big-city residents have seen the neighborhood ball
diamond on the vacant lot replaced by an apartment or of-
fice building. The expansion of our labor force by an influx
of married women has paradoxically increased the need for
supervision of children and youth, while shorter workweeks
have given workers more time for leisure.

The presence of nearly 500,000 patients in institutions
for the mentally ill and of 165,000 in our state and federal
prisons and reformatories is evidence of the special leisure-
time needs of a large segment of our population. A nation-
wide ten per cent increase in recorded uvenile delinquency
in 1951 over the preceding year points up the necessity for
action. I

By no means will recreation programs solve all of these
problems. Yet, together with religion and education, rec-
reation has an important role to play.

i What does a good community program look like and

whom should it serve? First, it should be said emphatically,
there is no single best pattern. Each community, in con-
formity with its available resources, needs to develop a de-
sign to meet its special characteristics.

An adequate program will provide opportunities for rec-
reation suited to various age groups from tiny tots to golden-
agers. Age grouping is favored by some recreation spe-
cialists. The similarities of interests and skill development
are given as reasons for this method of classification. Others
point with alarm to the trend toward separation of the family
whether it be for work or for play. They favor the kinds of
programs which provide facilities for family group activi-
ties. Father-and-son, father-and-daughter and mother-and-l
daughter nights are proving popular.

Recreation, even for elementary and secondary schoo
pupils, does not have to be exclusively on a separate sezi‘
basis. Some schools are providing time for boys and girls

in the early adolescent years is more easily broken down
by frequent, wholesome intermingling of groups of boys and
girls under competent supervision.

Physical activities have a place in every organized rec-
reation program. They should not dominate it, however,
or be restricted to team sports and strenuous competition.
0n the other hand, the importance of athletics should not be
undercstimated.

Dramatics, symphony orchestras, choral groups, adult
cducation courses in arts, crafts and industrial arts are il-
lustrative of the variety of recreational offerings. Good
libraries, forums and discussion groups, picnic areas, parks,
playgrounds, teen-age'centers and, more recently, commun-
ity centers for all ages are terms which suggest breadth in

the opportunities for the pleasurable and wholesome use of
leisure.

What can the interested citizen do about all of this? First,
one nceds to survey the local situation. What opportunitics
for wholesome use of leisure are available? Are the ones
now in existence utilized by the people most likely to profit
by them? If not, why not? What needs exist that are not
now bcing met?

The next step is to adopt a plan of action. Usually the
individual citizen will find it advantageous to arouse the in-
terest and enlist the support of an organized existing agency.
Where a responsible group has decided that additional rec-
reational opportunities are both needed and within the fi-
nancial capacity of the community, the next decision con-

cerns the agency or agencies that should be asked to meet
the needs.

Patterns of organization differ widely. There are, how-
ever, three main plans for administering community recrea-
tion. One is under the direction of the local board of educa-
tion. Milwaukee has been cited for the excellence of such
a scheme, with the recreation department responsible to the
board of education, through the superintendent of schools.

Proponents of school administration argue that modern
education is concerned with the total well-being of people

cally, the schools ought to be ready to serve such groups.

and that play activities fit appropriately into the educational
pattern. They point out that the school facilities are usually
well suited to a successful leisure-time program for varying
ages. Many of the phases of the school program already
contribute to the opportunities for physical and emotional
release. Physical education, arts, crafts, music and much of
the adult education program are in this category.
Advocates of other types of administration argue that
schools are still too concerned with the formal aspects of
learning to be able to adjust to the newer concepts of the wise
use of leisure. They say school authorities have, in effect,
pleaded guilty to charges of failing to recognize the full
smpe of a desirable recreation program by the very fre-
quency of their placing this responsibility on physical educa-
tion departments. They complain that funds are reduced for
recreation first whenever school budget cuts are necessary.

-—

        

School facilities provide setting in which local people
can experience recreational aspects of “adult education.”

Some, noting the wide recreational possibilities of parks,
suggest that park departments take over the supervision of
all publicly-organized and -supported leisure-time programs.
The traditional, major emphasis of park authorities on con-
struction and maintenance is held by others to be a deterrent
to that department’s heading up a forward—looking total
program.

The recreation professionals tend to favor a special agcncy

' in city and town governments. Since the opportunities to

begin completely new programs seldom exist in any except
the smaller communities, the interested laymen.must begin
with the agencies already existing. Often, the public schools
are in a particularly advantageous position to be of great
assistance. \Vith the current emphasis on teaching avoca-
tional and other leisure-time pursuits to children and youth,
schools. are in a strategic position in the recreation scene.
That one state, alone, boasts of five hundred and seven com-
munities which sponsor adult eduéation programs is further
evidence that the schools are providing a‘ considerable
amount of the leadership even on the adult level. When it
is understood that large numbers of the merribers of the adult
classes are “studying” folk dancing, handball, shuIIleboard,

397t

arts and crafts, the full significance of the recreational aspect
of “adult education” becomes self-evident.

Regardless of what agencies are charged with the chief
responsibilities for community recreation, the schools have
certain obligations. First, c00peration with all concerned
in developing a community program of recreation is a defi-
nite function of any school system which lays a claim to an
interest in the emotional, physical, and social growth and
well-being of people.

Second,-boards of education through their executive offi-
cers, the superintendents of schools, should make school
facilities available for recreational use. It is granted that
some “headaches” will arise, particularly if an agency other
than the schools is administering the program: It is not
suggested that cooperation is a one-way street. Rather it is
urged that school authorities make every effort to work out
satisfactory arrangements supported by written agreements
which will permit the multiple use of school facilities needed
for wholesome community-wide use of leisure.

Recreation supervisors have a responsibility for the prop-
er care of school buildings and grounds. In some situations,
school facilities can be utilized best by school-employed and
-directed personnel irrespective of the general administrative

pattern. Where there are well-equipped libraries in elemen-
tary schools, it is a recreational as well as an educational ad-
vantage to have those facilities open during summer vaca-
tions on a limited basis under the supervision of school
librarians. '—
Making existing facilities available for recreational use
is most desirable, but not enough. Boards of education and
school administrators should take community recreational
needs into account whenever new buildings are to be con-
structed. With careful planning, usually at little extra cost,
provision can be made for multiple evening use of school
grounds and buildings. Storage space for adult recreation
equipment is a sample of the type of extra space needed.
Third, schools have an obligation to provide the trained
leadership for community programs of recreation wherever
it is needed and cannot be provided more satisfactorily by
any other public agency. To insure a coordinated program,
this leadership should be on a year-round basis. Care should

398

be exercised in choos1ng t0p leadership with sullicient
breadth of vision to provide a balanced program.

Where summer day camp or recreation programs do not
already exist, education authorities would do well to examine
the possibilities of establishing them under the sponsorship
of the schools. '

Fourth, schools need to give increased attention to edu-
cation for the wise use of leisure. Not only should pupils
have opportunities for learning the necessary skills for sports
which have carry-over value in adult life, but they need to
acquire tastes, interests and skills in many other areas suit-
able for leisure-time pursuits. The example of schools in
Michigan, California and other states in providing camping
experience for pupils for a week or two during the school
year is worth widespread adoption.

Of course, there should be the closest kind of cooperation
between the community groups, both public and private,
which sponsor golf courses, tennis courts, bowling. alleys,
skating rinks and the like.

The reading habits attained under the guidance of the
English teacher will, in part, determine the adult use of
spare time. The teacher who expected all his pupils to at-
tain mastery of the best of the classical literature regardless
of the price may have been successful as, frequently, success
in teaching is measured. Still, the teacher who was a bit
more sympathetic .with the less interested may have con-
ducted classes where good reading was a pleasurable and
joyful experience which elicited more of the same. They tell
us that the importance of a pleasant first contact is beyond
measure. Children who have had an unpleasant experience
when they began to learn to swim, even though they become
good swimmers, seldom learn to enjoy swimming as thor-
oughly as others. Similarly, pleasure from reading may have
been conditioned by early school experiences.

The influence of the teachers of dramatics, music, art, in-
dustrial arts, home economics and even the social studies
will be reflected in the selections which former pupils make
for the use of their time outside the so-called working hours.
It may have been the intense interest in good government,
encouraged in Miss X’s class, that kept providing the spark
and drive which made the community forum a success last
winter. The thrill of making a simple set of book ends in
the seventh grade industrial arts class may have started the
interest that has led to attendance in adult education wood-
working classes and the establishing of a home shop.

A community concerned about the emotional, physical
and social well-being of its members will offer a wide variety

of opportunities for the enjoyment of hours away from the
factory, the oflice, the kitchen and the classroom. It will

encourage individuality and keep all recreation on a strictly
voluntary basis. The recreation cafeteria, as it were, will
have a storage room well stocked with supplies for differing
menus. A choice will be available on the counter but the
selections will vary from day to day. Each diner will be
invited to select a balanced meal with enough of the staple
foods to insure a full diet. The vendor of the food is less
important than its quality, quantity and variety. It is ac-
cording to their individual tastes, developed over the years,
that the diners will make their choices.

36th National Recreation Congress, September 27 to October 1

FROM rue FIRST thing Monday morning until adjourn-
ment Friday noon the first St. Louis National Recrea-
tion Congress will be full of features which will challenge
the minds and renew the inspiration of America’s recreation
leaders.

The Congress is most fortunate to have Mr. C. D. Jackson,
vice-president of Time, Inc., one of America’s outstanding
experts on public opinion, to address the opening session.

For nearly twenty-five years Mr. Jackson has been on the
very frontier of life—national and international. During
this period, and particularly for the last fifteen years, he has
been at the center of American leadership working on our
international relations: working to help prepare America
for its part in World War 11; serving later in England,
Turkey, North Africa, France and Belgium during and fol-
lowing the war; since then, as president of the National
Committee for F rec EurOpe, he has helped to keep alive in
the hearts of captive countries the h0pe of freedom. For the
past year he has served as special assistant to President
Eisenhower.

As a widely traveled business man and as one of the chief
executives, publishers, and editors of that dynamic group of
journals, Time, Life, and Fortune, and the new member of
that family, Sports Illustrated, Mr. Jackson has been close

I to the needs and desires of peOple——people in all walks of
I life, not only in our country but throughout the world.

I At the other general sessions the delegates will hear ad-
dresses by Dr. Doak S. Campbell, W. G. McGlothlin, Joseph
Brown, Joseph Prendergast, George Hjelte and Soichi Saito.
_ Soichi Saito is president of the National Recreation Asso-
'ciation of Japan. As one of J apan’s civic and religious lead-
crs, he is well-known for his work in behalf of Christianity
and democracy in the Far East. He is general secretary of
the YMCA in Japan and has represented Japan in many
world conferences on religion, education and recreation. He
attended the first International Recreation Congress in Los
Angeles in 1932. He addressed the World Conference of
Churches last month in Evanston, Illinois.

Dr. Campbell has been president of Florida State Uni-
versity since 1941 and is one of the nation’s outstanding
educators. He and Mr. McGlothlin, of the Southern Regional
Education Board, will discuss the report on “Recreation
Leadership and Training Needs in the Southern Region.”

   
  
 
 
 
 
   
  
      
    

EPTEMBER 1954

This study, made by the NRA for the Southern Regional
Education Board, will be formally presented to the board
soon after the Congress.

As executive director of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation, Mr. Prendergast will report on the state of the rec-
reation movement. Mr. Hjelte, general manager of the Los
Angeles Recreation and Park Department, will speak as
chairman of NRA’s National Advisory Council, which will
have its first meeting at this year’s Congress.

Joseph Brown of Princeton University is both an associ-

' ate professor in the School of Architecture and an instructor

in boxing in the Department of Physical Education and
Athletics. His hobby, creative playground apparatus, will
provide the subject for his address.

Immediately following the formal program Monday eve-
ning, employees of McDonnell Aircraft Company of St.
Louis, famous for their musical and dramatic productions,
will present a special entertainment program. This will be
just the first of many special features which the creative local
arrangements committee, under the chairmanship of the St.
Louis recreation superintendent, John Turner, has de-
veloped.

A major change in this year’s program eliminates a gen-
eral evening session on Tuesday. The program for this eve-
ning will consist of section meetings and workshOps and a
demonstration of synchronized swimming by Beulah Cun-
dling, U.S. senior national AAU solo synchronized swim-
ming champion. This demonstration will be held at' the
Washington University pool and will attract great interest
among delegates as well as among swimmers in the St. Louis
area. Synchronized swimming is one of the newer recrea-
tion activities and it is enjoying fast-growing pOpularity.
Mrs. Cundling is the first woman to hold both the indoor and
outdoor solo national titles and she also is the first to hold
the national solo championship for five consecutive years.
She has appeared in many parts of the United States and in
France, Germany, England, Wales, Israel and Bermuda.

A special St. Louis Day is being planned for Wednesday
in order to dramatize, for the citizens of St. Louis and St.
Louis County, the importance of recreation and the many
opportunities which the Congress affords for acquiring in-
formation about developments across the country.

The theme of the general evening session on this day will

399

Beulah Gundling

be “What is the Responsibility of Local Government for
Recreation and Parks?” The topic will be deve10ped with
specific application to St. Louis and St. Louis County but, as
the program is planned, it will have general application and
should be a valuable meeting. 'Questions which will be con-
sidered include: What areas and facilities should be pro-
vided? What programs and services should be offered? How
much should be done by the municipality and how much by
the county?

The St. Louis department has undertaken responsibility
for the table decorations and favors at the Congress ban-
quet, the theme of which will not be revealed until the
banquet doors open Thursday evening.

A new series of meetings on the program this year will be
watched with interest: “Recreation in Correctional Institu-
tions.” Meetings for town-country, industrial, and hospital
recreation workers, and for recreation supervisors, have
long since deve10ped into miniature conferences within the
framework of the Congress itself; and these meetings, to-
gether with the executives’ sessions which will break up into
smaller groups, are concentrated again on Monday. New
recreation executives will have still another opportunity to
meet together and discuss their problems at a session on
Tuesday afternoon.

Sessions for board members, for senior citizens, and for
puhlic relations have been doubled and each will have two
sessions instead of one as formerly. The same is true with
the meeting on pr0perty development and maintenance
problems. Interest in these topics has led to allowing more
time for them.

Another general topic which will see more emphasis this
year than in recent years is that of sports, with a meeting on
sports clinics, one on sports problems, and a third on com-
petitive sports for girls and women. This latter topic has
been somewhat controversial and it is hoped that discus-
sion at the Congress this year may help to clear up some

misunderstandings.
J. J. Donovan, associate director of the Civil Service As-

sembly of the United States and Canada will talk on job
analysis at the meeting on this subject. At the meeting on
urban redevelopment, the Division of Slum Clearance and
Urban Redevelopment of the Federal Housing and Home
Finance Agency will be represented.

Both resident camping and day camping are included in

this year’s program because of the steady rise in interest in
both of these meetings.* ,

While husbands are busy at meetings, wives may choose
activities for their days from the program which is being
worked out by the local arrangements committee. Details
concerning this program will be available when the Congress
opens, and a report will be sent in advance of the Congress to
all wives who let us know that they are planning to come to
St. Louis.

Demonstrations will be conducted during the week by
Miss Grace Stanistreet, director of the Children’s Theatre at
Adelphi College in Garden City, New York; by Miss Helen
Hartwig, physical education instructor at the Pershing
School, University City, Missouri; and by members of the
NRA leadership training staff. Miss Stanistreet will head
up the drama workshops on Tuesday and Thursday after-
noons and she will also take part in the section meeting on
the recreation activities program. Miss Hartwig will demon-
strate rhythmic games on Tuesday afternoon with children
from the University City schools. Mr. Staples, of the NRA
staff, will direct workshops in his specialty—arts and crafts
——Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and Tuesday night.
Social recreation training sessions will be available Monday
morning, Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and Tuesday
night.

St. Louis is an active center for SPEBSQSA and it is ex-
pected that barber shop quartets will be harmonizing in
every available corner throughout the week.

Two of the outstanding points of interest to be visited on
the recreation tour are Shaw’s Garden and St._Louis’ world-
famous Forest Park Zoo. Shaw’s Garden contains the larg-
est collection of plant life in the western hemisphere and
ranks second only to the famous Kew Gardens of England.
Delegates will be allowed about thirty minutes at this stop.
The stop at the zoo will be an hour in length and will feature
the chimpanzee show, one of the most entertaining features
of this or any other zoo. Special arrangements have had to
be made by the St. Louis commissioner of parks and recrea-
tion, Palmer Baumes, since this show normally closes im-

amediately following Labor Day. Commissioner Baumes

stated that the chimpanzee performance is internationally
famous and is the only show, as such, in the world. It features

about fifteen of these animals, and six trained ponies, and
is witnessed by something over three million pe0ple per
year. It has been the subject of many newsreels, and pictures
of it have been shown in every country in the world. In the
show itself, the acts include roller skating, motorcycle rac-
ing, riding bicycles and unicycles, a band act in which they
play various instruments, do usual trapeze work and the like.
It is truly an outstanding performance.

The local committee is arranging for a Congress message
center where delegates can receivc mail and messages right
in the midst of all the activities.

The busy Congress press room will again offer many serv-
ices to delegates, including a daily round-up news release.
This release will be available at nine o’clock each morning,
covering the previous day’s activities, and can be picked up
then and mailed to hometown newspapers. Last year’s home-
town photograph service worked out so successfully that

plans are being made for offering an Opportunity for special
news photographs again this year. If interested, get in touch
with the press room immediately upon your arrival so that
an appointment for your picture can be made.

The Jefferson Hotel is well suited for a National Recrea- ‘
tion Congress since all of the public rooms are on the mezza-
nine floor and the floor immediately above. Congress regis-
tration, a consultation ccnter, the St. Louis local information
booth and the exhibitors will all be located on the mezzanine
floor. The secretary’s office and the press room will be on
the floor immediately above and meeting rooms are located
on both floors.

Registration badges will be required for admission to all
Congress functions. Delegates are urged to register as soon
as possible after the registration desk opens on Sunday noon
so as to get ahead of the large crowd which is always on
hand to register on Monday.

“ gram provides a partial answer, but it does not necessarily
include all of the boys and girls who want to participate.
For reasons which cannot be taken up here it may actually
exclude students who most need to learn leisure-time skills.

Is the secondary school, then, without any other oppor-
tunities for providinglleisure-time education? Interested
teachers in many of the traditional subject areas could poini
to experiences which their fields provide that are directly
related to recreation activities in which individuals and
groups often engage. There can be no question that many
of the skills and knowledges taught in such areas as art
music and physical education, are important preparation
for the recreation life of the individual. But what of the
other high school subjects? Are there opportunities for ex-
periences within these areas which have implications for
leisure-time education?

In an attempt to answer the foregoing questions, a study
has been made of the contemporary secondary school pro-
gram in which each subject area was evaluated separately.
As a preliminary, seven objectives of education for leisure
which could be used as criteria for the evaluation process
were established. These objectives were based on funda-
mental needs of individuals that could be met, at least in

(7) activities that provide complete change and temporary

The results of the study indicate that all of the high school
subject areas have within their present course-content many
and varied Opportunities for providing experiences which
include the learning of skills_and knowledges in leisure-time
activities. It would be impossible to summarize the possible

rcontributions of all the subject areas in an article of this
type, but a few illustrations should serve to indicate the tre-
mendous opportunities of the present secondary school pro-
{gram for meeting its objective of education for leisure. The
areas of art, music, and physical education have been pur-
posely omitted since their specific contributions have been
generally recognized. Rather, it will emphasize those areas
in which possible contributions to leisure education seem
less obvious and fewer in number.

I English and Speech—The more apparent opportunities in
this area are those in recreational reading, creative writing,
story telling, drarnatics, play production, public speaking,
debate and panel discussions. Less obvious are those experi-
ences in arts and crafts included in such activities as the
I'naking of original drawings of characters from literature,
the study of art principles as applied to journalism or as

art of a unit in developing avocational interests, handcraft

rojects such as theatre models and costume design, the

a subject for a research paper and the like. Community and
school service projects including service to the school library
and oflice, contributions to the school and community news-
papers and similar activities provide for training in activi-
ties which may be carried on into leisure-tilne. Units such
as enjoying nature, reading stories dealing with nature, field
trips as parts of units on conservation, oral and written
reports on nature hobbies, gardening, and outdoor living and

 

camping may also be included in English courses. Further
leisure—time activities related to specific units may include
collecting hobbies, dance and music illustrative of various
periods of literary history, social recreation such as quiz-
type games, charades and the telling of anecdotes, sports
writing, units or projects on travel and so on. Actually, the
breadth of activities may be as great as the interested teacher
will encourage, since student interests are used for many
oral and written projects.

MatlrertiaticsHSkills and knowledges in mathematics re-
lated directly to leisure-time activities include those taught
in drawing, lettering, design and architecture. Mathematics
is also related to the development of such hobbies as model
construction, woodworking and elementary surveying. The

making of models from clay, soap, plaStic and similar ma-
terials may well lead to recreation activities in this area.
The use of mathematics in interior decorating, home design,
costume design and garden planning are further possibilities
for the encouragement of leisure-time activities. Mathema-

tics is also related to scientific experimentation in chemistry, '

astronomy, physics, navigation, machinery and so on. Math-
, ematical recreations such as “brain teasers,” puzzles, chess
and card games are valuable for the teaching of mathema-
tical principles as well as for their leisure-time interests. The
reading of biography, history, scientific books and current
periodicals is also suggested. The collecting of coins, stamps,
illustrations of symmetry found in nature, architecture,
jewelry, pottery and so on may well lead to the development
of a leisure-time hobby. An interest in travel may be gener-
ated by a study of the architecture of other countries as well
as a study of the influences of the early Egyptians, Greeks
and Romans on the deve10pment of mathematics. In a unit
on consumer mathematics, activities may include actual trips
to scenic and historic places.

Science—Many of the leisure-time skills and knowledges
which may be taught in science classes are apparent to any-
one who knows the curriculum. Biology, general science
and astronomy present almost unlimited opportunities in
nature study and hobbies—bird lore, animal lore, insect col-
lecting, wild flower conservation, beekeeping, meteorology,
climate and similar activities. Scientific experimentations
in biology, general science, physics and chemistry are re-
plete with opportunities in the type of activity that may be
carried on during leisure hours. Radio, electronics, photog-

404

raphy, home mechanics, plant and animal breeding, electri-
city, weather and climate are but a few of the specific areas
suggested. Less apparent, perhaps, are scientific reading;
opportunities for drawing, etching and photography; the
construction of models, map making; camping and outdoor
activities such as group hiking, exploring, primitive camp-
ing and field trips of all kinds; Opportunities for community
service hy c00peration in making health surveys, and in
campaigns to eliminate rats and flies, and similar activities;
the study of music in physics; the development of an inter-
est in travel through the study of transportation, trade

routes, map reading, and the life and customs of peOples in
other countries.

Social Studies—Significant opportunities for experiences
in drama and speech, literature and human relationships are
present in the social studies program. Dramatizations, dc-
bates, forum discussions, panels, mock elections, radio pro-
grams, pageants, recreational reading in biography, histori-
cal fiction, the writing of original plays, radio scripts and
editorials are all activities that have leisure-time value. The
study of patterns of culture, skills of good citizenship, self-
government in the classroom, trips to courts, police stations
and local industries all contribute to skills in human rela-
tionships. Art skills and knowledges may be encouraged
through the study of art and architecture of various pe0ples
and periods in history, the drawing of cartoons, the construc-
tion of models of homes, furniture and villages, and the
making of posters, maps, pictographs and so on. Social rec-
reation, including folk dancing, music and the songs of other
nations, may be part of the study of the culture of peoples.
The collecting of stamps, coins, pictures, clippings, flags,
dolls and craftwork may encourage collecting hobbies. Par-
ticipation in community activities and the giving of service
is also emphasized. Interest in travel is encouraged hy ex-
cursions to historic spots, discussion of travel experiences,

correspondence with pe0ple of Other countries and reading
about places of historical interest.

Foreign Languages—Significant opportunities in foreign
languages for presenting leisure-time skills and knowledges
occur in the areas of human relationships, literature and
travel. Projects such as the sending of boxes of food and
clothing to war-torn areas, corresponding with foreign stu-
dents and the use of other meaningful materials for deve10p-
ing insights and understandings are important in encourag-
ingiinterest in other peoples. Reading in geography, myth-
ology, history, travel, novels—in both English and the for-
eign language—encourages recreational reading and an in-
terest in travel. Opportunities for teaching of art principles
and skills occur in the study of foreign architecture, paint-
ing and sculpture; music activities suggested are thc singing
of folk songs and the study of foreign composers and their
music; drama and speech activities include play production,
pageants, radio programs, puppet shows, fairs and fiestas;
folk dances, foreign games, quiz games, anagrams and other
social recreation may be used as supplementary activities;
and thc collecting of post cards, coins, stamps, maps and

photographs may encourage the deve10pment of a collect-
ing hobby.

RECREATION

Business Education—Although business education is
largely a vocational subject area, it may contribute inci-
dentally to leisure-time skills such as art, the principles of
which are taught in advertising and display. Drama and
speech activities used are dramatizations, debates, panel dis-
cussions, radio programs and mock trials. Community serv-
ice is encouraged in such activities as service to the commu-
nity chest and other welfare groups, and assistance to school
organizations where business skills are needed. Units on
travel are included in a number of courses in business edu-
cation. Arts and crafts used as supplementary activities in-
clude the making of posters, models, costume and textile
designs; and opportunities for some scientific experimen-
tation occur in consumer economics. A number of state
courses of study include a unit on recreation for the course
in consumer economics. The importance of recreation in thc
full life is considered and many of the above activities are

studied from the point of view of their value to the individual
and to society.

Home Economics—Opportunities in home economics for
the teaching of leisure-time skills are many and varied.
Home economics contributes heavily in the arts and crafts
area with such activities as the making of toys, furniture,
hooked rugs, wall hangings, lamp shades, book ends, waste
baskets and so on. The “fun” aspects of cooking, sewing,
needlecraft, flower arrangement and gardening are also

stressed. Social recreation activities include the planning
for parties, the making of game kits for families and similar
projects. Dramatics and Speech activities consist of drama-
tizations, skits, radio programs, panel and round-table dis-
cussions. Outdoor and camping skills such as outdoor cook-
ing, fire-building, group hiking and participation in the
school camping program, and community service activities
including participation in clean-up campaigns, improving
housing conditions, health projects of all kinds, voluntary
care of children, the rcpairing of toys and assistance at com-
munity parties for children all may deve10p similar interests
that can carry over into the individual’s recreation life. Sev-
eral state courses of study recommend entire units on recrea-
tion as part of the home economics course.

Industrial Arts—As in the field of home economics, indus-
trial arts courses'are replete with opportunities for the teach-
ing and learning of leisure-time skills. Art skills such as
drawing, design, etching, lettering, and manual arts and
crafts such as lapidary, ceramics, plastics, leatherwork, carv-
ing, silk screen, woodwork, metal work, radio construction,
printing, automotive and engine mechanics and clectricity
are illustrative of skills taught in industrial arts. The skills
of boat building and archery equipment construction may
lead directly to an interest in sports and outdoor activities.
Experiences in nature study may accompany the study of
woods and such t0pics as reforestation, growth of trees, and
our state and national forests. Courses in stagecraft and the
construction of marionettes and puppets may encourage an
interest in dramatics. Opportunities for scientific experi-
mentation are recommended in radio, electricity, electronics,
phot0graphy and the like. Community service may be en-
couraged through the production of posters, letterheads,
tickets, programs, and the construction of equipment needed
for other school activities, or for similar activities for com- '
munity and welfare organizations.

ln the foregoing discussion, subject-matter content only is
considered. How these experiences are presented so that
their importance is understood by the student, the values to
be derived from the learning experiences, and the relation-
ships with opportunities to be found in community recrea-
tion prOgrams and the programs of private and semi-private
agencies is of equal importance and must be considered by

the teacher.* Furthermore, there is a need for further inves-
tigation of the individual subject-matter areas and the ex-
tracurricular or co-curricular program by the teachers con-
cerned in order to discover every possible Opportunity for
education for leisure in their own schools and communities.
The seven objectives for leisure education listed earlier may
serve as criteria for this intensive evaluation. They may
also guide interested educators in their efforts to give all
students the rich background in thc leisure-tinlc experiences
which are essential to full and complete living. The present
secondary school program has practically limitless oppor-
tunities for the teaching of leisure-timc skills. thther they
are taught and how they are emphasized is the responsibility
of the educators concerned.

DON’T EXCUSE yourself. Take a brush

and go to it. Every person is en-
dowed with a creative potential. This
can be develOped to be the source of con-
stant inSpiration and joy. Adult educa-
tion points the way to the exploration
of our artistic capabilities, regardless
of age.

The mature person in particular
should be' encouraged to pursue the
marvelous gratifications to be derived
from work in one of the arts. In France
every doorman paints. In Italy the best
arias are sung by barbers and fisher-
men. This contributes to their happi-
ness as well as to the culture of their
country. After all, it is more fun to
model ash-trays or paint apples than to
spend time on some analyst’s couch.

Adult art education has great thera-
peutic value. The motivations which
bring a student to the class are secon-
dary to the results obtained. Surely the
advantage of creating a painting or
sculpture which the student can take
home and show others places art classes
in a favored position. In no other field
of endeavor can the student feel such
accomplishment and pride as in art ac-
tivities.

I have found that amateur artists are
in a class by themselves. They paint
for pleasure and relaxation. They are
non-competitive and can become better
adjusted.to themselves and to society.
To me, the adult student is the ideal
student. He brings a lifetime of experi-
ence to the class. He is c00perative and
willing to experiment. He will not fritter
away his time in useless activities but
wants to reach his goal by the means
best suited to his purpose. As a matter

of fact, I have learned as much from my
students as they have learned from me.

At Pace College we have worked out a
new teaching technique with hundreds
of adult students that engenders rapid
progress. Since every person has doodl—
ed or can doodle, at the phone or at his
desk, we take this as the initial step. The
student uses a piece of drawing paper
and some charcoal. The paper is divided
into four equal parts, and a doodle is
drawn in each section. The most im-
portant lesson at this time is not to en-
courage the students to draw with geo-
metrical lines or angles but to express
themselves organically with curves and
rounds. By the fourth doodle on sheet
number one, the student has automati-
cally eliminated useless lines and has
arrived at a creditable pattern. He now
selects the most interesting drawing
from sheet one and develOps it on a
larger scale on sheet two. He may either
continue with charcoal or begin using
color which he selects to retain a unity
of design and color.

Doodles flow naturally from the hand
and are extremely suggestive. One dis-
covers in them faces, figures, landscapes
and compositions. By the third rendi-
tion of the original doodle, the student
will strengthen only those lines that sug-
gest a form or composition, and will
leave out all other lines. In this man-
ner, drawing technique, association of
ideas and forms, as well as the use of

 

color, are rapidly assimilated. After
these experiments the student continues
with compositions of his own choice,
gradually adding shadows, texture, new
colors, and various media. Whenever
the flow of ideas runs dry we return to
the doodle and its unlimited associa-
tions. Some of our students are so fas-
cinated by this approach that they
doodle whenever they can—the house-

wife while cooking, or the banker who,
forgetting himself, signs checks with a
doodle.

Nothing is as rewarding as the con—
templation of the work of one’s own
hands. There is a great physical and
spiritual releasecin art activities which
leads to peace and contentment. For
example, the immediacy of the doodle
reveals much of the student’s person-
ality and enables him to develop his
own artistic style much faster. But, in
addition to creative joy, classes in the
various arts give fellowship that stems
from mutual assistance, criticism and
the constant process of inter—learning.

Most adult students discover not only
art, but themselves. The potential crea-
tive capacity which exists in every
human being is released through the
democratic practices of adult Education.

From School to Maturity

PHILATELISTS SHOULD HAVE A HOBBY

The current civil war which is raging
between topical collectors and other lov-
ers of stamps is taking on pr0portions
of a major struggle. Scott’s monthly
magazine” tries to give both sides of
the story. Accusations and name-calling
from each faction fill the air. The t0pi-
cal collcetors who are Johnny-come-
latelys have a strong organization in the
topical association. They think that
their way of collecting stamps is more
fun than that which the old-time phi-
late’ic associations advocate. They know
that their method is much easier and
requires much less study. They do not
care if it is not very scientific. They
think it tells a story by the use of post-
age stamps of the world depicting what-
ever topics they are interested in. The
t0pical collectors’ equipment is much
more simple than that of the serious
philatelists. Some topical collectors do
not even know what a postmark detector
outfit is, and not many of them own a
perforation counting gauge. To them
stamps are pictures printed on paper,
and they usually do not know that there
is a difference in the kinds of postal

paper used. As to minor varieties, they -

think those are a musical revue put on
by the junior class of the local high
school. They need no extensive phi-
latelic library of expensive and highly
specialized books. Give them a last
year’s or even a more obsolete catalog
and they are in business.

The hobby that they have selected
gives them entertainment, relaxation,
and a whale of a lot of fun. They can
tell the stories of their jobs or the com-

panies they work for or their profes-
sions or. avocations by picking out
stamps that picture things that are t0pi-
cal and pertinent. If they work for Lilly
Daehé or Mr. John, they can collect all
of the women’s headgear that appears
on all of the stamps of the world and
make a very interesting t0pical collec-
tion. They can be railroad men and
show pictures of the old log-burners or
the latest diesel engines on stamps of all
the world. If they are volunteer firemen,
they can get stamps showing pictures
of fire wagons. If they are zoologists
or work for the Museum of Natural
History or the Bronx Zoo, they can get
almost every animal in the world pic-
tured on a stamp.

Yes, there is something to be said for
topical collecting. As a matter of fact,
it would be an ideal hobby for a serious
philatelist to have for relaxation after
his strenuous and arduous work as a
scientific philatelist. There are even
stamps showing the making of postage
stamps and others depicting the design-
ing of postage stamps and others por-
traying collectors working with their
collections. Without too much expense,
the serious philatelist who makes a new
hobby of topical collecting can get a
collection of the first issues of many
countries as they are commemorated by
reproductions of their first stamps at
their hundreth or eightieth or seventy-
flfth anniversary. The serious philat-
elist, who has to wait a long time to
accumulate enough money to buy that
elusive rarity which he does not have
and then has to wait a longer time until
that stamp comes up at auction, can
have a lot of fun whiling away the
time by making a t0pical collection of
almost any subject—the bridges of the
world, the entire development and man-
ufacturing of airplanes or a collection
showing almost every type of plane that

, Joseph C. Horan

has ever been flown can be assembled.

Sheep raising, cattle raising, race
horses, and all the thousands and thou-
sands of different kinds of occupations
of men offer a fertile field for the im-
aginative topical collector. A Metro-
politan Life Insurance Company em-
ployee could collect and depict all the
varied activities of his own company or
even his own division or section. A fine
collection can be gotten together show-
ing the activities of the health and wel-
fare division, the law division, the med-
ical division, or the investment division.
Practically every industry in which the
company invests money has some sort
of postal reminder. There are hydro-’
electric plants, factories, automobile
building assembly plants, manufactur-
ing of every type, public roads, housing
developments, mining, the oil industry,
tankers—the choice is very wide.

For the glee club, there are many
pictures of singers on stamps which you
could collect. The players’ club members
have a wide choice of pictures of thea-
ters, actors and scenes from plays and
operas, all on postage stamps. The mem-
bers of the athletic association could
cover all of the hundreds of types of
athletes who are portrayed on stamps.
They could have an international field
day showing track meets, Olympic
games, baseball, basketball, swimming,
diving, and every other athletic activity,
by assembling that kind of topical col-
lection. The only rules that will limit
the topical collector are that he have a
topic to depict in his collection, and that
he have a fairly fertile imagination.

So, if any of you serious philatelists
want to have a party, why don’t you
take up topical collecting as a hobby?

FIRMLY CONVINCED that recreation

should involve experiences more cre-
ative than staring at television in a
hypnotic trance, American educators
have been taking active steps to bring
rich, dynamic recreation programs into
the school, beginning at the elementary
grade level.

This article is a sampling of some
types of leisure-time activities being
provided in the California elementary
schools, with which I am familiar. I wish
to emphasize, however, that noteworthy
activities are taking place throughout
the country. Because of space limita-
tions only a few of the hundreds of ex-
cellent programs in California can be
mentioned.

Let us start with a look at the Jeffer-
son School in Fresno. Here, club activi-
ties replace ordinary studies every Mon-
day afternoon starting at two-thirty.
Clubs can be kept to a maximum size of
twenty because primary teachers whose
classes have been dismissed for the day
supplement the grade-school teachers as
club sponsors.

Visitors, who are always welcome,
are fascinated by the variety of absorb-
ing pursuits, which include handcraft,
stamp collecting, puppets and Inarion-
ettes, square dancing, cooking, travel
discussions, cartooning, and the mak-
ing of model airplanes.

Boys and girls in Sacramento schools
enjoy frequent trips to both the Junior
Museum, which has an excellent collec-
tion of live animals, and to the Crocker
Art Gallery, where special classes are or-
ganized for them. Hundreds of Sacra-
mento children each summer participate
in music classes—which lead to the or-
ganization of several junior bands and
orchestras.

Many films are shown on nature,
travel, and recreation. English classes
promote recreational reading, traveling
libraries operate during the summer.
The school shops specialize in skills that
can be used in leisure-time crafts.

In the schools of Burbank, children

learn techniques of making murals, il-
lustrations, or paintings; develop col-
lections of stamps, rocks, flowers, or
leaves; learn to weave, sew, and dye;
construct models in wood; or have ex-
periences in dramatization and dra-
matic play—to give an incomplete list.

The Santa Barbara schools have long'

regarded recreation as one of the basic
functions of human living. Arts and
crafts, physical skills, social graces,
sportsmanship, constructive use of fa-
cilities at school and in state and federal
parks, and individual counseling are
emphasized.

Every visit to the Long Beach schools
discloses further evidence of excellent
work. In the social-studies unit one may
see children handling tools and working
with wood in creating their Indian vil-
lages, covered wagons, and pioneer
forts. In the Chinese unit children learn
the rudiments of clay work and glazing.
They make cheese and imitation Swiss
carvings in the Swiss unit.

A close administrative relationship
between community recreation and the
schools in Long Beach guarantees that
skills learned through instruction are
continued in the recreational patterns
for both school and post-school use.

The Roosevelt School in San Diego is
in the process of developing an outdoor
fireplace, of considerable proportions,
which will provide boys and girls with
some outdoor cooking experience. Stu-
dents are taking an active part in con—
struction of the fircplace and adjacent
play areas, under supervision of tech-
nicians. Funds have been provided from
graduating classes and other sources.
The area will also offer horseshoe and
shuffleboard courts, a picnic area, and a
council ring.

In the Oakland schools various study

units involve experiences and instruc-
tions which later become firmly im-
bedded in the leisure habits of children.
Many of the folk dances are worked out
along with social studies and classroom
art. For example, a study of Mexico
involves dancing, costumes, cultural
patterns, reading, and other items pe-
culiar to that country.

An extensive instrumental music pro-
gram is carried on. There is an out-
door natural-science laboratory in one
of the nearby regional parks with a full-
time school employee. Children are
taken on field trips to this area for a
program related to elementary science.
The study of animals, birds, flowers,
and trees is emphasized.

Student Recreation Leaders

Journeying up through beautiful
Sonoma County, north of the Bay area,
one finds two excellent programs in ac-
tion, both well away from the popula-
tion centers. At Mount Vernon School,
a four-teacher school with grades one

' through eight, a leadership program

has been in existence for three years.
Seventh- and eighth-graders volunteer
their services. It is their function to
present games and activities at the noon
recreation period for all pupils—a re-
sponsibility thus far shared by every
member of these classes.

Activities are learned at planned
meetings between child leaders and
teachers. One boy and one girl serve for
a week and provide leadership for chil-
dren of the first through the fourth
grades. At the end of the week an evalu-
ation period takes place. Written com-
ments from these student leaders are
very interesting and indicative of their
level of maturity.

ville, a new program shows great
promise. Now in its first year, it is ex-
emplary of the fine things that can be
accomplished in the smaller community.
Every Saturday, from 9:30 A.M. until
4:30 P.M., the principal and one teacher
attract from ninety to one hundred and
twenty of the possible two hundred chil-
dren from kindergarten through grade
cight in a program that includes, among
other things, volleyball, bike races,
kickball, tag games, relays, flag football,
softball, and basketball. Skills in these
are taught in regular classes.

Children bring their lunches and eat
togethcr in the school cafeteria. Movies
are shown after lunch. Latest develop-
ments include tea served to mothers by
the girls and recreational activities for
mixed groups of parents and children.
Community response to this fine project
has bcen excellent.

Camp for Handicapped Children

Physically handicapped children from
Butte County schools were flown by
plane to the children’s camp in the Santa
Cruz Mountains near the ocean, where
limited physical education and instruc-
tion in the natural sciences became a
part of the two weeks' experience in out-
door education. Similarly, specific in-
struction becomes woven into learning
and recreational experiences in the
many school-camping and outdoor-edu-
cation projects throughout California.

Almost Everyone Learns to Swim

Visitors to Shafter Elementary School
are amazed at the excellent things to be
seen in that smaller community. A won-
derful triple-type swimming pool is a
part of the elementary-school facilities.

ming instruction scven months out of
the year. Upper-grade boys and girls
assist as student leaders with younger
children. Every child is required to takc
swimming unless medically excused.

Skills in volleyball, paddle tennis, cro-
quet, shufi’leboard and many other ac-
tivities are taught in classes of mixed
groups, again assisted by student lead-
ers. The noon-hour program attracts
over eighty-five per cent of the children
for co-recreational play in the activities
previously taught. All the activities are
those that can also be enjoyed in later
adult years.

Adults Help with work Project
In the city of Redlands a new pro-

'gram got underway this year after long

months of planning and study. Chil-
dren and adults combined to construct
large numbers of games and recrea-
tional equipment. Student cluhs and
groups focus on playground and school
safety, games leadership, tournament
supervision, and many other. aspects of
the program. A new participation em-
phasis has grown in that city because
of the many and varied opportunities
givcn children for leadership and plan-
ning.

I was never more agreeably surprised
than when I visited the small and some-
what isolated schools of Inyo County,
tucked high up near the western edge

 

of the High Sierras, where I saw the
first coeducational and co-recreational
activities taking place day after day at
all grade levels. This excellent program
is building wholesome boy-girl rela-
tionships.

other mountainous and thinly popula-
ted area in Calaveras County has cxem-

After watching dozens of these stimu-
lating and resourceful programs in
action, I am happily convinced that
the youngsters now in our California
schools will never be at a loss for some-
thing interesting to do with their leisurc

" is clearly out-
lined; but to many of our associates our
contours are fuzzy and blurred—they
are not quite sure who or what we are.
It is perhaps a little like the story that
is told of John Barrymore who, at the
height of his fame went into a Holly-
wood shop, purchased some articles and
said, “Charge it as usual.” The clerk
asked, “The name, please?” He
swered, “Barrymore.” The clerk asked,
“And the first name?”—to which he

replied frigidly, “Ethel.” This seems
to represent some of the kind of confu-

an-

sion that exists in relation to the profes-
sional recreation leader.

In our world of today, we see a new
phenomenon developing, recreative ac-
tivities have become part of the life of
every individual. In a recent article‘
one finds this statement: “The awe-in-
spiring spectacle that the figures reflect
is the birth of a new leisure class, not
a minority that gives all of its time to
play, but a majority that gives play part
of its time.” This is largely an earned
leisure, a time when the worker seeks
to find refreshment for mind, body and
spirit, a refreshment which he does not
usually find in the routine work by
which he has earned his leisure.

When a person is hospitalized, he is
still the same person, but now, instead

of working for wages he is working for
a recovery of the greatest possible use

his work with renewed energy and ze'st.

In community living we have come to
recognize that recreation activities need
leadership—leadership that knows how
to help all people to use their leisure for
truly re-creative purposes.

After a half-century of performing
leadership functions in recreation in
community living, we are beginning to
define the leadership roles that we have
developed. Generally speaking, there
are two major types of leadership, pro-
fessional and volunteer. The volunteer
is usually thought of as the person for
whom recreation leadership is an avo-

cation rather than a vocation. The pro—-

fessional recreation leader brings to his
job specific skills, knowledge and atti-
tudes. In acquiring these he has been
subjected to certain disciplines which
have helped him to achieve a mature
personality as an individual. This in
turn implies that he has recognized that
he must contribute to the life of his
group rather than absorb life from the
group, as is so often the case with the
amateur leader. The truly professional
leader will view his work as a profes-
sion, an absorbing vocation requiring
a broad education and a wide experi-
ence. At the same time, however, he
will understand that to be such a leader

Dr. Edith Ball

he must lead a life of his own if he
is to make his greatest possible con-
tribution to recreation. This is an ex-
pression of his maturity.

When an individual must change
from community living to institutional
living he remains the same person but
his focus changes. This means that the
hOSpitalized individual needs a type of
recreation leadership similar to that
which he experienced in community liv-
ing. One difference, however, may be
noted. As indicated above, the hospi-
talized person shifts his emphasis from
a more or less equal focus to a single
focus. To this extent, then, he is atyp-
ical. From this standpoint then there is
a strong indication that there is a need
for the most highly trained recreation
leadership in hospitals, if the special
needs and peculiarities of physically
and mentally handicapped persons are
to be met. In the hospital setting the
professional recreation leader becomes
a participating member of the team
whose goal is to help the individual live
to his fullest capacity with whatever
handicap he may have. As a member
of this team the recreation leader as-
sumes certain specific responsibilities
that are quite different from the respon-
sibilities of those team members who
are concerned with treatment processes.

The last few years we have been in
the midst of a controversy on whether

recreation is therapy. Today, more and
more, we hear statements that the tools
of recreation may be used as therapy,
but that recreation as such has a place

vidual just as it does in the life of the

reation research has been so scanty that

we have no means of proving that the
tools of recreation may be used as ther-
apy. However, we do have enough evi-
dence from the research in the area of
basic needs of people to show us that
re-creative activities are necessary, in
the lives of all people, as a means of
changing pace and relieving tcnsions.
Accepting the assumption that the
institutionalized person still retains his
basic human needs, we can then assume
that this individual also needs recrea-
tional experiences as part of his total
living. What part then does the pro-
fessional recreation leader play in the
hospital and what particular training
does he need to play this part?
Primarily, the hOSpital recreation
leader is a leader and a counselor. This
indicates his responsibility for helping

one person can know that much. Nich-
olas Murray Butler once said, I“The spc-
cialist is a broad person sharpened to
a point.”2 Apply this to recreation, and
we find that there is a need for a va-
riety of skills, with a depth of knowl-
edge in one or two.

Although an individual may desirc
to pursue anything from a study of San-
skrit to playing the piccolo as his rec-
reation, we find in the meager research
that has been done that the majority of
people like to concentrate their recrca-
tion activities in certain fairly well-de;
fined areas. For those whose interests

lie outside of these circumscribed areas,
the professional leader’s responsibility

is to direct the individual to the sourcc
where he can find the activity he de-
sires. This is part of the leader’s broad

individuals and groups define recrea-
tion goals and chart the methods by
which they may achieve these goals. To
do this the recreation leader must have
an understanding of human growth and
development and the ways in which the
human organism adjusts to social en-
vironment.

The professional recreation leader
must also be a teacher, for it is often
necessary for the lcader, in helping
groups to achieve their goals, to teach
the spccific skills and techniques that
are involved. The professional leader
needs a broad base of knowledge of
skills that will make it possible for him
to introduce his group to thc particular
skills in which they are interested. On
this score, many will protcst that no

background.

The major areas in which recreation
interests are usually centered are arts
and crafts, collecting activities and hob-
bies, dance, drama, language activities
—such as creative ‘writing, newspapers
and forums—nature and outing ac-
tivities including all kinds of camping
and trips, social activities, aquatics, wa-
ter activities, and Sports and other phy-
sical activities. Even to learn basic skills
in these areas implies a hroad educa-
tion, some of which will probably need
to be part of the professional leadcr’s
total skill learning rather than part of
his professional training. This means
that in thc selection of studcnts for pro-

fessional training we must choose those
who have wide interests. When a leader
is found who has special talents in one
area, he can be more highly trained in
this area so that he may become a re-
source person for a larger group of rec-
reation leaders whose skills are not spe-
cialized and who, therefore, have a
reSponsibility for a variety of activities.

In the hospital recreation field we see
an application of this. The professional
hospital recreation leader must first be
a good recreation leader, a person who
is mature, who has a wide variety of
skills, who understands people and how
they function as individuals and as
groups; and, in, addition, he must know
and understand the psychological and
sociological aspects of handicapped and
ill persons and how the usual recrcation
program may he adapted to their needs
and to the institutional or hOSpital situ-
ation.

There is also another very important
understanding, which the hOSpital rec-
reation leader must learn, that is en-
tirely peculiar to the hospital situation.
In community living, recreation today
takes its place alongside of education,
social welfare and health. When an in-
dividual is hospitalized his life no
longer has this kind of balance; it is
skewed and one-sided. Treatment of a
specific illness is the particular business
of the hospital. On this basis, every-
thing else becomes subservient to the

treatment process. Recreation is one

No
longer does recreation take its place
alongside of health; now it is secondary
to health. The recreation leader in the
hospital must recognize this and adjust
both his personal attitudes and his pro-
fessional program to it. This is perhaps
the most difficult adjustment that the

professional recreation leader must
make. '

To date, the attitudes of the other
workers in the hospital have not helped
to make this adjustment of the profes-
sional recreation leader easy. Too often
the recreation leader is relegated to a
position of sufferance rather than one

of those subservient activities.

in which he is recognized as a memher
of the whole team. The part that he

- plays may only be that of a defensive

player, but the offense—the treatment
group—has no chance to play if they

411

never receive the ball. All must work
together. Treatment procedures may be
most important, but the whole person
is hospitalized, and all facets of his per-
sonal needs must be met if the most
important one of treatment is to be most
effective.

This side of the professional recrea-
tion leader’s job brings to the fore
another aspect of his work. The profes-
sional leader must know how to organ-
ize and administer the program. When
the objectives of the, individuals and
groups have been defined, the profes-
sional leader must be able to help these
people to reach their goals effectively,
within the framework of hospital living.
This means providing facilities, schedul-
ing activities and facilities so that there
will be no interference of one group
with another, providing equipment or
helping people to provide equipment for
themselves, financing the program, help-
ing groups to find a means for recog-
nition of their activities, and securing
specialized leadership and then super-
vising it.

Under the general heading of organ-
ization and administration certain cleri-
cal and maintenance duties need to be
included as part of the professional
leader’s responsibilities. If people are
to be served effectively, records must be
kept, reports made and equipment kept
in repair. Professional leaders need to
know how to perform simple clerical
and maintenance tasks and where to
secure expert help to perform the more
complicated jobs.

As we begin to think of the tasks in-
volved in recreation leadership, we he-
gin to see why this particular work is
considered as a developing profession.
At present it fails to meet all of the
criteria which delineate a full profes-
sion. Kauffman3 defined these as: L1);
a profession is based on'a highly1r spe-
cialized intellectual technique; (2) the
professional technique must be capable
of communication through a highly spe-
cialized educational discipline; (3) the
professional technique must be of suf-

ficient social significance and impor- -

tance to warrant the exercise of 801110
control over it by society, the practi-
tioners themselves, or by both operating
together; (4) preparation for and prac-
tice of the professional technique so
stimulates and occupies the practition-
ers that they form professional associa-
tions for improving its standards and
extending public acceptance; (5) the
conduct of the practitioners is a matter
of concern to the profession and results
in the formation of codes of ethics; and
(6) within the professions there is a
conscious recognition of a spirit of pub-
lic voice which places social duty as the
highest goal of the profession. ,.

Certainly we can see that we have
made a start toward achieving all of
these criteria, but we are too new to
have fully developed our intellectual
techniques or defined how these may be
communicated. Our greatest weaknes-
ses probably are our failure to conduct
the necessary research that would prove
our hypotheses and to define the basic
training that is essential to produce a
professional recreation leader. In both
of these areas we have made some prog-
ress but we still have a long way to go.
The remaining criteria have been at-
tained by the recreation profession in
a fair measure. We have professional
organizations; there is a code.of ethics;
some control is exercised over the prac-
titioners as evidenced by the several
forms of certification that have been
instituted in several of our states; and,
currently, social duty is the only goal
of the profession, since monetary and
prestige values are practically nonexis-
tent.

Because so much emphasis has been
placed upon the social satisfactions, and
so little upon the monetary returns, it
has been hard to attract good potential
leaders tochis field of study. Recrea-
tion is not an easygoing profession, and
it is hard to find a sufficient numher of
people who choose to make it their life
work. In an age in which material
values rank high as a measure of suc-
cess, it is difhcult to convince people
that other values bring more lasting
satisfactions. Salaries in the whole field
are certainly not commensurate with
the demands put upon the professional
leader, and in the hospital field they are
probably a little less inviting, primarily
because they tend to be so much more

“dead end” than in the communlty rec-
reation field. It is possible to become
a recreation superintendent in a com-
munity, but it is almost impossible to
become a superintendent in a hospital.

A vicious circle seems to exist: until
people are well-trained there is a ques-
tion whether salaries should be raised,
and until salaries are raised well-trained
people will not be attracted to the pro-
fession. The only way out of this di-
lemma seems to be to provide_ adequate
salaries for the few well-trained pro-
fessional leaders, and to provide sub-
professional titles and salaries for those
with less adequate training. If this were
done it would also be necessary to pro-
vide at the same time for some type
ofin-service training, which would help
the sub-professional to gradually im-
prove his capacities to the point where
he would be qualified for professional
leadership responsibilities and the com-
mensurate salaries. This could not be
a short-range program. It would prob-
ably take ten years to achieve any re-
sults and twenty-five before professional
standards could be raised appreciably.
However, when one thinks in terms of
other professions this is not a long time.
Medicine and law have been profes-
sions for hundreds of years and are still
finding many ways in which to improve
their standards. On this basis a twenty-
five-year program is a very limited pro-
gram. '

In the hospital recreation program
there is probably the greatest oppor-
tunity to develop good standards of
professional leadership. It is the infant
in the recreation family, and the family
have now begun to see how they wish to
raise their children. Furthermore, the
family relations—such as the fields of
social work, nursing and medicine——
have provided some good examples
which the recreation profession can fol-
low, avoiding the pitfalls and thereby
progressing a little faster. Every link
in the hospital chain, total service for
the welfare of the individual, must be
strong. Recreation is such a link and,
to date, has been a point at which serv-
ice has often broken down. We need

to work togcther to strengthen this link
and bring it to its greatest potential ca~
pacity if total, fully effective service is
to be given to every hospitalized person.

N0 GREAT CITY with comparable problems has done more
in a similar period to make highly industrialized urban
life not only bearable but healthy, happy, interesting and at-
tractive. . . . Parks are not even second to modern housing
in their beneficial influence on city growth and change, and
no less dominant than health and schools in their effect upon
civic morale.” With these words Commissioner Robert
Moses concludes a profusely illustrated sixty-four page re-
port rccording twenty years of progress in the department of
parks in New York City. ‘

The remarkable expansion in the city’s park areas and
facilities is indicated by a few figures taken from the report.
Several great parks have been created. Park lands, which
totaled only 14,000 acres in 1934 now comprise 27,000 acres,
or considerably more than ten per cent of the city’s total
area. The variety of sources from which these new areas
came—by transfer from other departments, by acquisition
of tax liens, by purchase, condemnation and donation, as
part of joint programs with schools and housing agencies,
in connection with parkways and expressways, and espe-
cially by reclamation and filling of waterfront and other
neglected properties—bears witness to the resourcefulness
of the park authorities.

Recreation facilities have increased fivefold in these
twenty years. Playgrounds have increased in number from
119 to 597 since 1934 and several others are under construc-
tion. Many of these areas are designed to supply recreation
to all age groups. Tennis courts have more than doubled,
and holes of golf have increased by more than fifty per cent.
Athletic fields, picnic centers, bicycle and bridle trails, boat
basins and areas for a wide variety of recreation activities
have had a comparable expansion. In contrast with two in-
adequate outdoor swimming pools in 1934, the department
now operates seventeen well-constructed facilities.

The reclamation and development of the New York water-
front has been an outstanding achievement. Thousands of
acres of new park lands have been created by pushing out
the bulkhead line along the shore front, by filling swamps
and reclaiming blighted areas. Only two park department
beaches with a single mile of frontage existed in 1934; today
the city has 16.2 miles of municipal beaches, efficiently de-
signed and operated, and several additional beaches are
being planned. Construction of modern sewage disposal
plants by New York City, eliminating pollution of its bound-
ary waters, made possible the safe and enjoyable use of the
new beaches by the city’s millions. A staff of six hundred
trained lifeguards, lieutenants and chief lifeguards is cm-
ployed to safeguard the use of the city’s pools and beaches.

Facilities for indoor recreation have been confined pri-
marily to small playground buildings and to a few centers
originally built as public baths or gymnasiums. In March
1951, however, the park department opened St. Mary’s Rec-
reation Center,1 the first of a series of year-round buildings
proposed for eight congested sections of the city.

A significant develOpment has been the cooperation be-
tween the board of. education and the park department
whereby forty-five playgrounds have been jointly planned
and operated. The board maintains the playgrounds during
school hours, except for the areas set aside for mothers and

pre-school-age children, and the park department maintains
them at all other times. City playgrounds have also been
provided in connection with many of the public housing
projects.

A broad program encompassing interests of individuals
and groups of all ages has been developed as park lands and
facilities have increased in number and variety. A staff of
866 directs and conducts the year-round program. Many of
them are organized on a competitive basis with the c00per-
ation, financial support or oint sponsorship of civic organi-
zations, the press and individuals. The department’s mari-
onette theatre and its program of summer concerts and

social and square dances in the major parks are especially
p0pular.

The park department budget has not increased in propor-
tion to its expanded service—in 1934 it was $6,000,000 and
in 1953, $22,000,000. “Most park facilities must be free,”
states Commissioner Moses; yet, under his efficient manage-
ment, revenues from rentals, concessions and income-pro-

ducing facilities totaled $3,000,000. The value to the city
of sound park develOpment is illustrated by the high increase
in the assessed valuation of nearby property. It is also re-
flected in the growing number of gifts to the park depart-
ment. Among these are the Wollman Memorial, a large out-

door ice skating rink,2 two merry-go-rounds donated by the
Michael F riedsam F oundation—one in Central Park, the

other in Prospect Park. A boathouse with dining facilities,

Opened this spring, was the gift of the Loeb family, and
another boathouse, also in Central Park, for the storing and
servicing of model boats, is being built by the Kerbs family.

An anonymous donor provided the funds for a chess and
checker house in the park.3

Recess Play Calls for Careful Planning

0 Today the recess period, as well as the noon
period, serves as a laboratory for daily instruction in
which skills, rules and' techniques of a wide variety of
game activities are taught. Crowded school play-
grounds in large urban areas, where space is at a
premium, have forced many administrators to care-
fully organize these periods so that each child can be
assured of a safe and equal Opportunity for partici-
pation.

Even in rural areas where space is no problem, or-
ganization of play activities provides children with
group recreational eXperiences that would not be
available otherwise.

Although such a program requires time and effort
at first, once it is under way it will reduce yard prob-
lems, including hazardous and mischievous play, to
a minimum and lessen the strain of teacher super-
vision on the playground during recess and noon
hours.

OUR SCHOOL cafeterias, auditoriums, gymnasiums, swim-
ming pools (of which we have too few), libraries, work-
shops, and playgrounds, provide essential educational, social,
and recreational experiences that are just as important to
modern living as the three R’s, commonly referred to by the
business girl as reading, reels, and radio! Our present con-
cept for one world, the ability to get along with all peoples,
to cooperate for the general good, should begin right at
home. In this direction, we have made some real progress
in many of our California cities. There are two points that
should be stressed in this connection: (1) getting rcspon-
sible school and city representatives together to discuss and
plan projects of mutual concern; and (2) designing, plan-
ning and constructing schools and municipal buildings and
grounds to meet the needs of the community. '

As an illustration of the first point, in our town we got the
city council, the school board, and the recreation commis-
sion together recently. There was a school plot then unused
and so, instead of buying additional land, the school hoard
permitted us to use this, the city put up the money and we
built a community recreation center. The school board bene-
fited because we put in the building two pre-school children’s
rooms which are used mornings and afternoons. The neigh-
borhood acquired a splendid new, and greatly needed, com-
munity center with gymnasium, locker rooms, showers,
snack bar, club rooms, director’s office, and so on.

My second illustration points llp features we have incor-
porated in our new elementary schools to provide neighbor-
, hoods,with recreation and community service. On the play-
grounds the supcrvision by men and women directors is on a

year-round basis—on school days from 3:00 to 6:00 and on
Saturdays from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 1 :00 to 6:00—and

CHARLES W. DAVIS, director of recreation and parks in
Berkeley, California, made this presentation to the Public

spicnons service to the college and eminence in field work.”

their salaries are paid hy the school board. We have a spe-
cial fenced area for kindergarten children and first graders;
another area for second and third graders; and a large arca
for the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Playground equip-
ment is laid out primarily for physical education instruction
in such a way as to avoid congestion or interference with
game activity; and we have hard surfaces. We have planncd
the arrangemcnt so that thcre is no interference with class-'
rooms and the school building as the playground is not im-
mediately adjacent ’to the classrooms. We have an indoor
playroom, twenty by ten feet, located off the playground,
where the director may keep his supplies, craft materials,
and so on, and where on rainy days craft activities may be
held indoors.

Toilet facilities, which are important but have been over-
lookcd in a good many buildings, are adjacent to the play-
ground, accessible from the classroom, but so arranged that
after school-hours children cannot get into the main huild-
ing from them.

The community center room, about twenty-four by forty
feet, is a part of the main school building. It has a separate
entrance from the street and is shut off from the rest of the
building so that it may used after school or in the evenings
without interfering with any other part of the school. This
is a multiple-use room in which, during the school day. we
have well-baby clinics, doctors’ examinations, instrumental
music instruction, and so on; and it has special .cabinets
wherc groups may store their equipment separately. Aftcr
school, the P.T.A., Dads’ Club, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls
and other neighborhood groups may huse it.

Our auditoriums have a level floor with a stage that is ac-
cessible from the outside. This facililty is available after
school for dramatic grOUps, folk dances, evening school
classes andithe “late leisure” brought about by industrializa-
tion. Why shouldn’t we put to use every available public
facility in our communities where need and demand justify
their use? They belong to the people—to the taxpayers. In
addition to their educational use, what better use could they
serve than to contribute to the pursuit of happiness?

Although juke box may be going full
blast, noise offers no distraction to
boys and girls playing table games.

NOT LONG ago when a group of about one hundred of our
younger teen-agers of the Texas School for the Deaf at
Austin, Texas, took over a deserted storeroom for a recrea-
tion center and set up some bridge tables and a ping-pong
table, they decided to name it “The Hawaiian Room.”

Our school was founded in 1856, and with its present en-
rollment of four hundred ninety-eight is the largest residen-
tial school for the deaf in the world. The buildings are very
antiquated and there is little money for recreation equip-
ment or supplies. So a glamorous name like Hawaiian Room
for an ugly old room with paint peeling from fourteen-foot
ceilings, no shades on its ten-foot windows, gaping holes in
the plaster and the dust of nearly one hundred years coming
up through the Splinters and cracks in the floor, seemed
ludicrous and incongruous at the time, but it resulted in a
challenge to us all.

We wrote to the Hawaiian Visitors Bureau in Honolulu
and asked their aid in providing posters or photographs that
could be used for murals or other decoration. Their re-
sponse was amazing and most gratifying. They not only
sent us a variety of items, but they contacted the airlines,

reation Board, was in public recreation work' for fifteen'

years prior to being employed a year ago in this interesting

ship companies, fruit growers, schools and other groups. We

were showered with interesting and colorful materials in-
cluding travel folders, historical prints, souvenir menu fold-
ers, wall posters, bamboo wall paper, and even a Hawaiian
calendar. For a period of six weeks it was like Christmas,
with a different package arriving every day. The children
would come in wide-eyed to see where the packages were
from and excitedly open them to see what had come that day.
With such an attractive variety of materials, we interested
the Junior League in redecorating the room. They were most
enthusiastic and the project got under way. The walls were
patched and painted “Hawaiian green.” The pledges from
Sigma Chi, as well as some of our own teen-agers, painted
the chairs in gay colors which picked up the colors in the
posters. A local business man, a Junior League husband
who does woodworking as a hobby, made frames for the
prints, and the posters were mounted on cardboard.r The
Garden Club, with the help of our teen-agers, landscaped a
patio near the entrance. A feature writer who was contacted
by the Junior League did a complete “before and after”
series for local newspapers which attracted much attention.
The renovation and face-lifting created much excitement
at the school, not only among the children, but also among
the staff and maintenance employees. People from the laun-
dry and the far end of the campus, who seldom came Up to
our building, dropped in constantly to watch the progress.

RECREATION

In their social science class, the boys and girls studied a
project on Hawaii giving them a better understanding of
the Islands. The Riverside School in Honolulu wrote to ask
that we exchange scrapbooks with them, and already wc
have received our first book very attractively bound in
tapa paper.

The publicity from newspaper and radio created a great
deal of community interest which resulted in several im-
portant gifts that aided in furnishing the room. More than
anything else, many of our teen-agers wanted a music box
for their dances. Previously, most of this group had noth-
ing to do after school except to wander around the campus
or sit in their dormitories. An eighty-three-year-oldster who
saw the newspaper stories became very interested in the
project and provided us with a very fine juke box, complete
with neon lights and twenty-four records especially selccted
for the deaf. Music with strong rhythms is used so the chil-
drcn can feel the vibrations through the floor. In the after-
noons some enjoy sitting close to the juke box with their
hands 011 the machine so that they can feel the music.

Recently, the American Legion gave us a handsome con-
sole TV which is a much-needed addition. Even though they
do not hear the speaking, the children are fascinated by the
pictures and derive much pleasure from it.

Everyone is very enthusiastic over this project because it
is a recognized fact that deafness is the greatcst of all edu-
cational handicaps; and one of the outstanding effects of
deafness is the retardation of social development. This fact
emphasizes a great need for a well-rounded recreation pro-
gram which will provide a better acquisition of social skills
as well as an Opportunity to develop inner resources.

The “Hawaiian Party” which featured the grand opening
was a happy affair for the teen-agers and the large group of
pcoplc who had helped to bring a dream to reality. The girls
made colorful leis and the local florists provided corsages for
the six who were hostesses. As they are our younger teen-
agers, they had never had corsages before and did not even
r' know the word. The children having oral abilities learned to
say the word “corsage.” The manual group promptly learned
to spell it on their fingers and made up a sign for it. The
United Air Lines’ Oscar-winning color travel film “Hiways
to Hawaii” was shown. A six-‘year-old hula dancer from the
Austin Civic Theater entertained the group, and Hawaiian
games were played. Flowers and tropical plants furnished

by Governor and Mrs. Allan Shivers added the finishing

 

touch to the room. Refreshments included Hawaiian punch,
sugared pineapple cubes, and coconut cookies made by the
.teen-age boys in their bakery class.

After this gala opening, the room has continued to be in
constant use by an ever-increasing number. Operated as a
drop-in center after school and during wcek-ends, it pro-
vides an inviting atmosphere wherc the boys and girls can
be together, learn social customs and adapt to social rela-
tionships. The “conversation corncr” is the most popular
spot where, uninterrupted, they may indulge in just “plain
talk-talk,” as they say. Fingers fly through the sign language
as they talk about the topics of the day or maybe just school
scuttlebutt.

Popular as the room is on weekdays, it is on Saturdays
and Sundays that thc TV and juke box are going full blast,
the ping-pong table is kept busy and there is always a line
waiting to play shuffleboard. Since noise is no distraction,
several of the group can often be seen absorbed in magazines
or thumbing through funny books while lounging on the sofa '
which was donated for the room.

One of our teen-age boys, while at home, did an original
water color, made the frame, and hung it in the room. An-

other made a shufiieboard set and repaired some of the
games. Soon we hope to add a snack bar, a hobby corner, an
herbarium and dish gardens, and many activities such as
chess and canasta. Craft classes and creative dramatics will
be conducted by the city of Austin recre'ation department.
The Garden Club plans to sponsor some junior garden clubs.

Another interesting development has been our students’
attendance at the symphony concerts. As a result of the
publicity from the Hawaiian Room, arrangements were
made for a group of our boys and girls_ to attend each of the
children’s concerts. The front rows were reserved so they
would feel more vibration, and the conductor and orches-
tra members are very enthusiastic about the innovation of
having deaf children in their audience. By careful screen- -
ing, we selected those children with some usable hearing,
with and without hearing aids. They were given instruc-

Golf is an activity—a natural—that
can be included in many recreation pro-
grams, indoors as well as out. There
are no doubt many men and women
who would like to learn the game but
who cannot do so because of lack of
time, equipment or facilities. All these
people can be accommodated by a rela-
tively small expenditure and the erec-
tion of inexpensive targets in a small
indoor space.

Contrary to common opinion, it does
not require expensive cquipment and
facilities. The area, if properly organ-
ized, can be used by many players at
the same time; and facilities need not
be elaborate to maintain interest.

The number of golf clubs needed will
depend upon the anticipated peak par-
ticipation. There should be a variety of
clubs for right- and left-handed men
and women; and woods and irons of
different numbcrs should be available,
as well as putters. Practice or regular
balls may be used, depending upon the
shot being played. Some regulation
balls are needed for putting.

In addition to the equipment men-
tioned, door mats, either of rubber or

fiber, are needed from which to play the
ball. Floor and wall targets should be
installed if at all possible. These targets
may be used as testing devices, if an in-
dividual wishes to find out how he is
progressing, or as an aid to tourna-
ments. The wall targets may be out-
lined directly on the wall or on canvas.
Because the canvas targets can be raised
or lowered to conform to the type of
club being used, fewer targets may be
necessary. Also, since the canvas breaks
the force of the ball, it conserves the
walls and reduces the possibility of
injury.

At least two types of wall targets
should be installed—one for the wood
shots and one for the irons. The num-
ber of targets of each type will depend
upon the space available. In the dia-
gram, Target A is for use with woods;
Target 8 is for use with irons.

For playing shorter shots, such as the
pitch and chip shots, Floor targets such
as Target C should be installed. The size
and the distance of these targets from
the practice mats will depend upon the
size of the recreation area. These shots
are very popular and lend themselves
easily to friendly play.

The shot that presents the greatest
problem is the putt. A long runner of
cocoa matting, three feet wide, makes a
good putting surface. There are sev-
eral types of practice putting cups on

tions by the teachers as to what to look for and how to
listen (that is, to notice varying rhythms, and so on) so
that they would get the most out of the concert. The rhythm
and vibrations they felt were supplemented by their small
amount of residual hearing. In this way we have been able
to make the symphony concerts an interesting experience
and one to which the children look forward.

In evaluating the project, our staff pointed out that the
children not only enjoyed going to the concerts, but that the
social experience and the auditory training they received
made it worthwhile—a project which should be continued.

Thus another project in community organization has been
successfully launched through cooperation of public agen-
cies and private individuals. As the Hawaiian Room grows
in interest and expands its functions, it will make a lasting

and continuing contribution to the lives and happiness of
our teen-age students.

the market that can be used with the
mat. With a little effort, and at rela-
tively little cost, a putting mat can be
built that has all the appeal of a regular
green. A wooden frame covered with a
piecc of twist rug fills the bill. A hole,
four and one-quarter inches in diame-
ter, may be cut at one end of the mat to
serve as the cup.

The golf set-up mentioned above
should prove to be a very popular one.
It can be used by anyone who wishes to
get ust a little exercise, even if he is a
rank beginner, or the more experienced
player can practice all of his shots in
anticipation of a coming match. Per-
haps the greatest value of the pr0posed
facility is 'that all sorts of tournaments
and games can be organized for either
a daily, weekly or seasonal period by
arranging each target on a scoring
basis. By means of a handicap system
the activity can be made to fit the capa-
bilities and interests of a large percent-
age of the players.

ADMINISTRATIO

A HIGH SCHOOL FIELDHOUSE
WITH A Rubber Track

N RECENT years, many progressive ed-

ucators have beep leaning toward the
Heldhouse as the answer to their Space
problems. Unfortunately, however, it
poses a serious health problem. And
that is dust—on the floor and in the air.
The only way you can copc with this
menace is by continual, costly sprink-
ling.

Last spring, Crystal Lake, Illinois,
came up with a revolutionary idea in the
history of school buildings—a beauti-

ful functional fieldhouse with a regular '

maple wood floor for basketball and
other activities, plus a large rubber com-
position area for track and similar ac-
tivities! In fact, everything but the bas-
ketball court is rubber-surfaced!

The surface for the area surrounding
the basketball court was the big ques-
tion mark as building plans progressed.
The planning committee unanimously
agreed that clay, Cinders, sawdust—in
any combination whatever—didn't
make a satisfactory general activity area
because of (l) the dust, dirt, and mud
problems, (2) the continual work and
expense of daily sprinkling, and (3) the
endless task of marking lines for courts
and lanes.

Sevcral other possible surface materi-
als were also rejected, one of the chief
reasons bcing that they proved too hard
for track spikes to penetrate. It was then
that athletic director Owen Metcalf ad-
vanced the idea of developing a track
surface that would be resilient and slip-
resistant, thus eliminating the necessity
of spikes.

Since all indoor game shoes arc rub-
ber-soled, it followed that a smooth rub-
ber surface would make thc hcst non-
slip top—providing as it would a rub-
ber-on-rubbcr contact.

MR. 0. R. BARKDOLL is an educational
consultant at Downers Grove, Illinois.

SEPTEMBER 1954

After considerable application to the

problem, we realized that since round
particles possess no cohesive qualities,
the rubber would have to come in small
strands.

A visit to a tire recapping shop fur-
nished the ultimate answer. These shops
use spike-covered cylinders, revolving
at a high rate of speed, to rip off the re-
maining parts of the old tread.

These shreds of rubber proved to bc
just the material we needed for our
track and floor. When bound together
with emulsilied asphalt (asphalt and
water homogenized) and treated with a
chemical agent to prevent the asphalt
from becoming sticky in hot weather
and from discoloring the athletic equip-
ment, the rubber shreds provided a
“dream” surface.

The problem of obtaining sufficient
rubber strands was solved by contacting
a Chicago tire recapping firm. The rub-
ber strands from a day’s work of recap-
ping truck and bus tires amountcd to
one cubic yard. Since one cubic yard
will cover seventy-two square yards one-
half-inch thick, twenty-one cubic yards
were needed.

During the year, we experimente'l
with different thicknesses of the asphal-
tic rubher mat, using a tennis court on
the Crystal Lake campus.

At the start of the experiment, (lircc-

O. R. Barkdoll

 

tor Metcalf intended to restrict the rub-
ber surface to the running track. But
after observing its toughness and inde-
structibility he decided to lay down a
half-inch layer of the asphaltic rubber
on the entire Held house floor surround-
ing the basketball court!

We realized at the outset that the half-
inch mastic coat needed the support of
a strong base underneath. For this pur-
pose, we decided to employ the least
costly of the asphaltic concretes, since
sandy materials treated with emulsified
asphalt have produced the most. fool-
proof and highly successful bases
known to the road building profession.

During the summer, some color was
added to furnish additional rellcctions
of light. The area from the basketball
court to the track pole was treated with
red coloring materials, while the area
from the pole to the wall was treated «
with green.

The track lanes and the game courts
have been permanently lined with bright
colors, using a rubber base paint emul-
silied and homogcnized with water—the
same as the asphaltic binder. {Any paint
that contains oil or turpentinc will dis-
solve the asphalt.)

RECREATIHN SCHMIL EMPEMTIIJN

J. A. Thayer

HE CITY school district and the recreation department of
Monterey, California, have c00perated in camping and
day camping programs for the past two years. We are rather
unique in that we have no camp of our own. Instead, we pro-
vide camping experiences for elementary school children in
rented facilities. In a camponaming contest last year the
winning name was “Quien Sabe?” This Spanish idiom
means “who knows,” And “who knows” where our camp
will be the next time we go camping?

Our camp and day camp are set up in accordance with the
California State Education Code under the title “Outdoor
Science and Conservation Education.” The director and
two supervisors are school people, with credentials for ele-
mentary education, who'are highly qualified to administer
and supervise «camping and outdoor science instruction.
Group leaders are employees of the recreation department
who have worked for at least a year on the local playgrounds
and who have been carefully chosen and trained as camp
counselors. The director and supervisors are paid by the
school; group leaders are paid by the department. Bus
transportation is furnished by the schools and all other
transportation and hauling by the department. All publicity,
camp fees, eXpenditures (except the salaries noted above)
are handled by the city of Monterey through the recreation
department.

The program is administered jointly by the recreation
department, which has direct on-the-spot control, and the

schools through the summer-session principal, who is re-
sponsible for curriculum. It should be strongly emphasized
at this point that this is not school camping in the general
sense of that program—it is a summer-school offering for
elementary school children.

The camp and day camp curricula are built around these
subjects: conservation; safety; identification in nature;
cleanliness—person and camp; rough camping and tech-
niques of outdoor living; swimming, as part of the physical
education program; crafts from nature; music appreciation
through group singing, folk dance, campfire songs; tech-
niques of obscrvation; reporting; group living. We use
visual aids for instruction in nature, outdoor science, con-
servation and fire safety. The national and state forest serv-
ices are very cooperative, furnishing free materials, films,
and personal services. It is not particularly difficult to pre-
sent four hours of instruction daily with all the curriculum
materials outlined above. The difiicult part is to arrange the
daily schedule so that the campers will receive the maximum
amount of instruction. (Four hours of instruction are re-
quired under the education code.) Many campers are as-
tounded to discover they have been attending school all week,
when all the time they thought they were attending camp.

Our nature program is based principally on the making
of collections. After thorough briefing on how and what to
pick, groups cover the countryside looking for specimens.
Groups may earn points for the specimens they collect, iden-
tify, mount and display; but the child displaying any par-
ticular item must be able to identify it, describe it and give

RECREATION

a brief report concerning it—whether it be plant, trce, soil,
roek, animal, bird, reptile or anything else. We find too,
that we are able to dispel a lot of nonsense about reptiles.
Fortunately, our only poisonous reptile is the Pacific rattle-
snake. Every child is briefed about it, as well as about the
scorpion, eentipede and black widow spider, all of which are
found locally. For first aid we teach the eut-with-suetion
method, the newer and more satisfactory cold treatment for
poisonous bites, and how to remove ticks.

\Ve have no “specialists” in camp leadership. Each leader
is trained to do the complete job with her boys or girls.
We use all girl counselors as we have found through eXperi-
enee that they do a better all-round job of handling day
campers of five through nine years of age, and regular
campers of eight through fourteen. Our older boy campers
sometimes turn their noses up at their girl leaders, but it’s
purely temporary. They come home sold on the leaders,
because our girls are able to do the things many of the boy
campers are taught in scouting. Girls also sense when all
is not well with a child; they are more tactful and under-
standing; and we, as well as the campers and the parents,
have been very satisfied with their leadership.

The camp session is of five days duration, from Monday
through Friday. Camp fee is $10.50 for residents of the
school district, $12.50 for those residing outside the district.
Each session has a quota of children from the various nearby
areas. Fees cover all costs, including insurance, transpor-
tation, leadership, food, supplies. Campers furnish only es-
sential bedding and necessary clothing. Toys, candy, gum,
comic books and other non-essentials not related to camp
program are arbitrarily confiscated, to be returned to the
camper at the end of the week. Our objective is to teach
boys and girls the rudiments of outdoor living and we feel
that for a few days they can do without the delights and com-
forts of everyday living. In this connection, our campers

PROGRAM

sleep on the ground and are thoroughly instructed as to how
to do so comfortably. A

Our eamp cookery is based upon three plans: meals pre-
pared by the camp cook staff; meals prepared by camper
groups; meals prepared by the campers individually. To
follow this program we set up a staggered schedule with
groups eating three meals at the cookhouse, then preparing
three meals as a group, or individual meals by groups. When
the group prepares a meal it divides into committees—one to
prepare salad or dessert, another to clean up after the meal.
The committees are appointed by the group itself. When the
group cooks individual meals, caeh camper prepares his own
fire, cooks, eats and cleans up as an individual project—all
this, of course, under the immediate direction of the group
counselor who, in turn, is under supervision.

Day camp in Monterey is probably a little different from
the usual, because we firmly believe that small fry of five
to ten years can have as much fun aetually.learning the
techniques of camping as they can just playing at camping.
We have 8mm films of five-year-olds building fires, cooking
and cleaning up, preparing beds on the ground, setting 11p
day camp. We have found these films invaluable as a means
of convincing skeptical parents that their children can do the
things we plan for them. We run the usual nine AM. to five
PM. program from Monday through Wednesday. On Thurs-
day, each camper brings sleeping gear, cooks his own dinner,
sleeps out all night, cooks breakfast, breaks camp and is on
the way home at noon on Friday. Day eamp ages, again,
are live through nine. Campers are assigned to groups of
their own ages and our leaders work hard for'the honor of
leading the five-year-olds through five days of day camp.

Needless to say, the greater part of Thursday is spent in
setting up camp, teaching the children to collect kindling
and fire wood, to prepare a fire site, build and tend the cook-
ing fire and to clean up and obliterate traces of the fire when

No “playing at camping” here. Small fry of Monterey day camp learn the rudiments of real camping and outdoor living.

finished. We have had as many as forty-four fires going for
dinner and breakfast, in a public park, and have left the park
in better condition than when we entered.

The breakfast menu provides fruit juice, bacon and eggs
fried in the same pan, hot chocolate, toast and jam. The
dinner consists of a half-pound hamburger patty (fried in
a four-inch frying pan over an open fire), roasted or boiled
fresh corn, bun, tomato, hot chocolate and banana. Later,
marshmallows are toasted over the campfire.

Each child teams up with another camper of his “own age
to prepare a fire for cooking the hamburger. If we are in
a park, we use two common bricks for a fireplace; if in the
country, we use rocks. The chocolate and corn are prepared
by the director, but the children clean the corn and get it
ready for roasting or boiling. After dinner, the pans are
cleaned by the “Armstrong” method—scoured with sand
or dirt and grasses. Cleaned pans are inspected by the coun-
selors and if all traces of food and fire are removed, the
pan is approved. Forks and other utensils receive the same
treatment. This may seem a little drastic, but here in the
Southwest, and in many places on the West Coast, water is
at a premium and we feel that if we can teach these young-
sters that it’s possible to keep utensils clean without water,
we’ve done them a service.

The director prepares food for the supervisors and coun-

selors so they may spend their full time with the children.
The counselor needs to give her full attention to the children
if she has, for instance, a group of five- or six-year-olds.

Financially, we figure to break even: food costs at whole-
sale prices average less than a dollar a day; fifty cents of
the camp fee goes into individual insurance; the balance
is spent for leadership and the few supplies needed. The
schools and recreation department have c00perated in the
purchase of such capital equipment as is necessary, but the
total in two years amounts to less than five hundred dollars.
We have been fortunate in that rental fees have been very
light—one camp charging as little as fifty cents per week per
child. We are dickering with some ranchers at the present
time, hoping to acquire property for our own camp—but
we are in no hurry.

Superintendent of the city school district, Glen T. Good-
will, is a booster for the program; the city manager of
Monterey, Walter Hahn, Jr., and the mayor, Dan Searle,
are also very interested in the camp——as is the entire Mon-
terey Peninsula. A considerable amount of interest stems
from the fact that we send home, at the end of the week,
a camper who has learned a great deal about rough camp-
ing and who has suddenly become conscious of personal
cleanliness, the attractiveness of clean surroundings and the
meaning of conservation in its broadest sense.

 

A New Version of

BASKETBALL

Tom King

Mixed basketball, introduced for the first time last season
by the Jacksonville, Florida, recreation department, met
with a welcome response. Older boys and girls and young
married couplés found the new version of the old cage game
very interesting and not quite as strenuous as the regulation
brand of basketball.

Except for a few necessary changes, the game is played
under the AAU rules governing men’s and women’s play.
The court has two divisions, and no player is allowed to
cross the center line. Men conform to men’s rules in their
half of the court and women observe women’s regulations
in their half.

The game always Opens with two men jumping at center.
In subsequent quarters, alternately a woman jumps against
a woman and a man jumps against a man. A similar regula-
tion is enforced in case of a held ball at the center line be-
tween a man and a woman. If a held ball occurs during the
first or third quarter, the woman involved names a man on
her team to jump in her place. If a held ball occurs at the
center line in the second or fourth quarter, the man involved
selects a woman on his team to participate in the jump.

The players reverse positions each quarter. If the men on

Team A are forwards in the first quarter they become guards
during the second quarter. Conversely, the women on Team

A would be guards in the first quarter and forwards in the
second quarter. The players change courts at the half and
continue switching positions in the final two periods.

Playing eight—minute quarters, the scoring has been some-
what on the low side with total scores usually between thirty
and forty points.

“Gateway City” playground directors have found that
boys and girls like playing basketball together. As a starter,
we had two four-team leagues playing this new brand of
basketball.

Although there is no physical contact between the sexes,
the game has a social flavor that both boys and girls enjoy
to the utmost. After all, if they can enjoy playing tennis to-
gether, swimming together and dancing together, there
really is no reason they shouldn’t have fun playing basket-
ball together.

7m: GROWING tendency to plan school buildings for com-
munity recreation use and the cooperative arrange-
ments that have been worked out between school and city
authorities to assure effective indoor and outdoor school
facilities for this purpose have been pointed out in recent

issues of RECREATION. Additional evidence of the value of
such action is further indicated in the statements that follow.

Dr. H. Clifton Hutchins, coordinator of the recreation
curriculum at the University of Wisconsin, in a paper en-
titled “Planning Recreation and School Sites.” points out
that whereas the neighborhood playground was formerly
considered as a play Space solely for children, planned on
the basis of so many square feet per child, it is now designed
by functional units to serve the various outdoor recreation
needs of the entire neighborhood.

After emphasizing that there is little conflict in the “times
of use” best suited to school and recreation interests, and
that this is a highly important factor in the planning of
outdoor and indoor facilities to serve both, he adds: “There
is no valid reason why public education and public recrea-
tion should acquire and develop entirely separate properties
to serve the same_ neighborhood when one pr0pert‘y.is suf-
ficient to the purposes of both. 0n the contrary, there are
important reasons for the oint acquisition and develOpment
of sites and facilities. When oint effort is made, the public
benefits in out-of-pocket cost, in efficiency of land use, in
convenience and in richer opportunities for living and learn-
ing.”

“Planning Schools for Community Use” was the topic
of the 1954- annual dinner meeting of the New Jersey Ree-
reation Association with Dr. Felix J. McCormick of Teach-
ers College, Columbia University, serving as panel chairman.
At this meeting, Dr. John Bosshart, former New Jersey
state commissioner of education, pointed out that school
administrators realize that economy dictates that school

f SEPTEMBER 1954

buildings and grounds be equipped with recreation facili-
ties for all. He stated: “To place school facilities at the
service of appropriate recreation agencies requires much
planning in advance of needs. It is dillicult to meet the
needs after the building is constructed. Joint planning by
committees, which include the municipal boards, the board
of education and the recreation department, is necessary
if we are to have school buildings which will be adequate
for school and community programs. Some of the problems

in connection with dual use of schools are:

1. Any plans must be within the scope of the state school laws
and must not prevent the board of education from providing an
adequate school system.

2. We must define responsibilities of school and recreation boards
—who will pay for the operational costs: custodial care, supervision,
light, heat, and so on.

3. Can the board of education avoid responsibility for any pro-
gram offcred on public school property?

“All these problems can be solved by joint consideration
on the part of pe0ple concerned, if all who are interested
put personal interests in the background and the interests
of all the people in the foreground.”

A member of the board of education in F airlawn, New
Jersey, emphasized the fact that it is no longer essential or
economically sound for education, recreation and park au-
thorities each to have a complete set of facilities under their
own control: “The demands upon community funds are
ever increasing. Land acquisition, especially in central areas,
is becoming more diHicult and construction costs are at
a high level. In these days of high tax bills it becomes es-
sential that the taxpayer receive the maximum return. This
can only be accomplished by careful planning and coopera-
tion on the part of school and municipal authorities.”

Mr. Hubert I. Snyder, superintendent of recreation in
Baltimore County, Maryland, described the cooperative pro-
gram for the develOpment of school-recreation buildings that
has been develOpcd in his county: “quking through citi-
zen groups, authorities in Baltimore County have develOped
community schools which are planned jointly to meet the
needs of education of the children and the needs of com-
munity programs.”

“The best minds in education are advocating the com-
munity school,” according to Mr. Weaver Pangburn, con-
sultant on park and recreation planning:

“The action that speaks louder than opinion is most en-
couraging both in the recreational use of many school plants

and the growing number of examples of cooperation in ac-
quisition, design, development and maintenance of the
school plant, and more particularlyiof its outdoor areas.

423

The publications of the NRA give proof of this.*

“Planning boards, boards of education and recreation
and park boards are coOperatively selecting and securing
school-recreation sites, preparing total designs for the com-
bined areas which ignore ownership lines and taking due
regard to the respective program needs, sharing deve10p-
ment costs and agreeing on a division of maintenance costs,
concluding in joint use of the areas, buildings and other
structures of both operating agencies.”

After listing general trends in school design, Mr. Pang-
burn mentioned further advances that are needed:

Location of the school building on the site: In spite of all that has
been learned about the need for ample outdoor areas for the cur-
riculum and for community recreation, some school buildings are
being placed deep in the sites, which is wasteful of the total space

and in some cases ruins the prospect for good planning of the rec-

reation area.

Recreation units that are administratively practical: This point is at
the heart of many difficulties encountered by the recreation depart-
ment in utilizing the school plant effectively. The distinct unit is
so much superior to facilities that are scattered throughout the school
building. '

Eight successive steps to achieve school recreation centers:

1. Acceptance by boards of education and recreation boards of
the fact of their distinctive and different roles in relation to com-
munity recreation. In this connection we shOuld not lose sight of
the strategic position of the separate recreation departments in
relation to the growing factor of the separate parochial school sys-
tems.

2. A realization of the important practical advantages to both
educational and recreational agencies in cooperative planning: the
securing of desirable outcomes for the leisure time of the public,
a greater good will to boards of education arising out of extensive
and satisfying community use, a much broader program for the
recreation department and the saving of many thousands of dollars
for both the schools and the municipality (cite some figures).

3. In our concept of the community school, both educational and

recreation leaders should think in broader and more inclusive terms.
We must get beyond mere basketball and physical activities. For the
outdoors the potentials in nature education and recreation should
be realized. There should be more music and art in the total pro-
gram. ,
4. These understandings should now lead to conferences between
the reapective boards and their administrators, resulting in joint
policies and action on property acquisition, development and main-
tenance and in the construction and use of school buildings.

5. Staff personnel should be officially appointed to coordinating
planning committees to work up all technical details, these com-
mittees to include city planning officials and city engineers as well
as the school and recreation or park personnel. There are a growing
number of examples of such committees or their equivalents in
Washington, D.C., Grand Rapids, Michigan, and so on.

6. An important part of the work of the coordinating committee
is to secure the participation of citizen groups, particularly neigh-
borhood groups, in the planning process.

7. Review and appropriate action on the recommendations of the
coordinating committee by the respective boards.

8. Carefully worked out and explicit instructions to school archi-
tects, landscape architects, park and recreation planners and others
on the elements to be incorporated in the combined school-recreation
units and their arrangement to facilitate the most effective use.

“By such steps or their equivalent we may look forward
with confidence to more and better school buildings and
areas which will serve the needs, not only of the school pro-
gram but also of community recreation.”

Dr. McCormick summarized the discussion as follows:

1. The concept of the community school is now widely
accepted, school administrators being trained to integrate
school and community. Schools must serve the entire com-
munity and be an effective agency in the improvement of
living conditions in the community.

* Mr. Pangburn referred specifically to The Use of School Build-
ings for Recreation and School-City Cooperation in the Planning of
Recreation Areas and Facilities.

424

2. Recreation and education are a team working for the
improvement of community life. Both have similar aims:
a. the preservation of our democratic form of life.

b. the improvement of the level of living.
c. the maximum development of each individual.

3. School buildings should be planned as neighborhood
and community centers, so that they serve the needs of all
age groups, children, youth and adults, from early morn-
ing to late in the evening, on weekdays and weekends, for
twelve months in the year. Larger school sites are definitely
needed to satisfy the school and community needs.

4. School buildings should be planned for multiple use
by children, youth and adults. Recreation and adult rec-
reation needs of the community require special considera-
tion in the planning process.

5. Better community-type schools will result if all those
who are to use the building and facilities are involved in the
planning process. This includes teachers, custodians, ree-
reation personnel, librarians, health department officials,
town government officials and so on.

6. Better use of existing and preposed facilities should
result if the recreation officials, town agencies and board of
education work out cooperative agreements concerning the
use of school facilities and the financing of the various com-
munity activities.

7. The relations between the board of education and ree-
reation officials involve considerations of design, control,
operation and financing of joint facilities.

The progress in joint planning to insure efficient and
economical administration is clearly indicated by a bulletin
entitled Joint Contractual Agreements for Recreation issued
in August 1953 by the California State Department of Edu-
cation. It says, in part:

In the deveIOpment of a total community recreation program, every
possible means of support and finance should he enlisted for the
common good. Recreation and community services are a reSponsibi-
lity of a varied group of agencies and governing bodies. The modern
community-school is an indispensable segment of this solution to
community problems. Notable in California have been recent trends
toward joint planning and development of sites for school playgrouan
use and instruction, as well as adjoining city development of park
and recreational sites. This alleviates the necessity of either pro-
viding larger acreage and facilities, to the end that both may he
used for the year-round maximum service to young and old of the
area. Very noteworthy also is the trend for city government to join
with school districts in the construction of adequate swimming pool
facilities to the end that priorities of instruction, water safety, and

recreation may not he diSplaced by over-balance of facilities for
only the highly skilled.

Never Previously Considered

Effective cooperation between recreation and school au-
thorities in the design of a new school building was recently
reportcd from a Michigan city. The school architect, who
had “roughed out” a plan for a new building and its site,
submitted it for comment to the superintendent of parks and
recreation, in accordance with a procedure jointly adOpted
in thc city. Revisions in the plan were made by the super-
intendent, and the school-city landscape architect, who re-
oriented the building, rearranged the rooms to better serve
recreation needs and presented the revised plan to the su-
perintendent of schools. The architect highly approvcd the
suggestions and changes and reported that although he
had designed many school buildings in the state, the factors
pointed out by the recreation personnel had never previously
bcen called to his attention.

Liability

The liability of school districts that carry insurance was
discussed in an article in the May 1954 issue of The Nation’s

Schools. It referred to a decision of the appellate court in
Illinois, in a case where a minor sued the school district for
injuries received on the school grounds during'a recess pe-
riod, alleging that the injuries resulted from negligence of
the school district’s agents in not supervising the activities
of the children in a proper manner.

The case was reported to be unique because the court
pioneered a new pattern of judicial reasoning as it concerns
school district liability. In this case, the district did not
possess the statutory authority to take out the liability in-
surance which it carried.

The defendant contended that it was immune from lia-
bility because it was a state agency and it also pleaded its

' lack of statutory authority for carrying liability insurance.

‘ SEPTEMBER 1954

In reversing the decision of the lower court, the appellate
court sustained the principle that a school district, as a
quasi-municipal corporation, was not liable for injuries re-
sulting from tort. It added, however, “Liability insurance,
to the extent that it protects the public funds, removes the
reason for, and thus the immunity to, suit.” This decision
apparently points the way, in the case of school districts
that carry liability insurance, for innocent parties to recover
damages for their injuries, without overthrowing the rule
that school districts as governmental agencies are immune
from liability in such cases.

Use of Lay Committees

O

Many recreation departments, including some adminis-
tered by a recreation board or commission, have made ef-
fective use of lay committees, although the use of such
committees is still too limited. The use of some sort of school-
sponsored committee of lay citizens meets with the over-

'whelming approval of the nation’s school superintendents,

according to a poll reported in the August 1953 issue of
The Nation’s Schools. Asked, “Do you favor school-spon-
sored committees of lay citizens to advise school ofiicials?”
eighty-seven per cent of the superintendents reporting an-
swered in the aHirmative. Seventy-one per cent held the
opinion, however, that citizens’ groups should be temporary
in nature for two reasons: so that more citizens could par-
ticipate; and to avoid the danger of a clash with the school
board. Although some superintendents of schools maintain
that lay committees are too hot to handle, a large majority
believe that there is no better way to insure good schools,
adequately supported, than to involve as many laymen as
possible to advise on school policy and programs. Many
superintendents of recreation find citizens’ committees an
excellcnt means of bringing the community into a closer

understanding and greater appreciation of their fundamen-
tal purpose.

School-City Cooperation in Practice

The following brief references to examples of cooperation
between school and city authorities in the acquisition, fi-
nancing, planning, operation and use of indoor and outdoor
facilities indicate the wide extent of such cooperative action.
East Hartford, Connecticut: Whenever a new school is being
planned the superintendent of parks and recreation “is in
on rccommendations for adequate outdoor space as well
as indoor usage.”

Appleton, Wisconsin: Several new school buildings have
been planned and built with the idea of full community use.
The recreation superintendent was consulted by the superin-
tendent of schools in the planning of the buildings to make
sure that exits and cntrances, activity rooms and multiple-
use areas would meet recreation department requirements.

425

The superintendent of recreation was given full responsi-
bility for the school playground layouts.

Lansing, Michigan: The park board has recently purchased
a ten-acre plot with the school board taking one-half of the
property. A school building site on park property was re-
cently exchanged for a playground site on school board
pr0perty. Several parks and schools are on adjoining sites.
Green Bay, Wisconsin: The city planning commission, city
schools and park board have each assumed their proportion-
ate share of the master plan of city development, the end
result being a saving for the taXpayers and elimination of
duplication.

Portland, Oregon: The park board owns thirteen pr0perties
that are adjacent to school sites. The school board has
agreed to build their playgrounds according to the park de-
partment’s specifications, and this department maintains
these grounds during the school year and uses them during
vacation periods.

San Jose, California: The city recreation department has
landscaped the grounds and developed modern playground
features at elementary and junior high school sites. The
cost of these improvements has been borne by the city, but
the schools maintain the areas.

Livingston, New Jersey: The school board and recreation
commission cooperate closely. One site has been jointly
purchased for school-recreation use, a part of it owned by
the township, the balance by the school board. A similar
arrangement is in effect in the case of a large park which
includes a high school stadium. The recreation department
pays for all the maintenance of school grounds and in turn
is not charged for any outdoor or indoor use of schools.

Baltimore, Maryland: The department of education and thc
bureau of recreation are joining in rehabilitation of school
facilities in the older inner-city areas. They recently com-
pleted a project including the financing and hard surfacing
of a school playground and installation of playground equip-
ment with each department bearing one-half the cost.

Greenwood, Mississippi: All recreation programs are
worked out by the superintendent of recreation in coopera-
tion with the superintendent of schools, and all school prop-
erty is made available for use in the program.

Fargo, North Dakota: Rooms have been added to five school
buildings for use by the recreation department as warming
centers for ice .skating, for indoor activities during the win-
ter and for centers adjacent to playgrounds in summer.

Moline, Illinois: The superintendent of the park and rec-
reation board has been consulted on the planning and lay-
out of schools. He designed the landscaping for the two
ncw school buildings which were made available for recrea-
tion when completed.

Miami Beach, Florida: Physical education directors of the
elementary schools and the recreation personnel of the rec-
reation department meet jointly twice a year—in the early
fall and spring—to plan joint programs for each school play-
ground and the nearby city playground. They exchange
playing rules and arrange alternate game schedules which
are approved by the school principals and recreation su-
pervisors.

426

Hamilton, Ohio: The schools and the city are pooling their

resources to get areas adjoining one another so that the
total needs will be met.

El Monte, California: A contractual agreement was reached
between the city and the high school district for the joint
use of a new community-school swimming pool built on city
property adjacent to the school. The pool was paid for by
the city and is rented to the high school district at fifty

dollars per day for one hundred and eighty school days
each year.

Los Angeles, California: The board of education and the
department of parks and recreation have had in effect, since
1930, a contractual agreement concerning policy in the pro-
vision of recreation service to the pe0ple of the city and the
school district and cooperation between thc two agencies.
Out of this agreement have grown many activities based
upon mutual cooperation.

Millbrae, California: The city and elementary school dis-
trict trustees have entered into an agreement for coopera-
tive planning in order to improve and facilitate the fullest
use of community property. The city had a tract of land set
aside for recreation but lacked funds to develOp it. When
the school district needed a new school, it purchased a build-
ing site adjoining the park which the city agreed could be
used for a school playground provided the property be de-
veloped with school funds and the city be allowed to use
it outside school periods. A multiple-use room serves both
school and community.

Compton, California: By agreement with the city, the ele-
mentary school district leased the city 3.8 acres of land at a
school, giving the city the right to construct a park on the
property. All facilities and equipment installed by the city
are to remain its property, and maintenance also will be a
city responsibility. Facilities were placed in the new park
to supplement and not duplicate existing school equipment.

A Word of Warning

Problems are bound to arise which call for further close
cooperative action on the part of school and city authorities,
even where school buildings are built through cooperative
effort. In one city where recreation wings in junior high
school buildings have been financed jointly by school and
city, and where definite agreement was worked out with ref-
erence to the use of these facilities, the school board is now
attempting to secure the use of facilities for high school
basketball games on two evenings a week presumably re-
served for community use. According to a thoughtful ob-
server, “Those who fought the idea of a joint ownership
from the first and who urged a separate recreation building
are now saying, ‘I told you so.’ They feel that the neigh‘
borhood youngsters and adults are not getting a square deal.
and that the proposal makes their recreation center fall intc
the category of just a school building. It all falls back or
the fact that school boards are dealing with mandatory ac
tivities while park and recreation boards are concerned witl
permissive or voluntary activities. There is so much dif
ference in basic philosophies that it does make their “thinly:
ing a bit different.”

RECREATIOD

A SCHOOL-CENTERED

 

“RECREATION for everybody” is a goal worth seeking for

American communities. Urban communities, with
grcater rcsources, are likely to reach the goal more quickly
than the scattered rural areas with their problcms of few
facilities, wide distances, and less concentrated pOpulations.

Yet the need for recreation is as vital to fruitful living for
country people as it is for city folks.

In facing the problem of providing recreation services to
rural communities, local leaders might well examine the one
agency that can be found in every community as a possible
rallying point for recreation programs for the people of the
area and, especially, for the children—the school.

The country school is a “natural” as a setting for both
community and school recreation. There are facilities—
spaces that may be used for meeting rooms, playgrounds,
and pcrllaps an auditorium or a gymnasium. There are par-
ticipants—-the children who spend six hours a day at school;
in fact, school time is often thc only time when a majority of
rural children can come together in groups large enough for
the socializing influences of guided and supervised play pro-
grams. Leadership, however, poses problems. This article
reports how S1nith County, Texas, organized a school-cen-

MR. KOCH, director of held experience for the Youth Lead-
ership, Recreation and Community Service Major at Spring-
field College, Massachusetts, was the recreation and physi-

cal education director, during the 1951-52 school year, of the
Smith County, Texas, program described in this article.

SEPTEMBER 1954

COUNTY
PROGRAM

I. I

William H. Koch, Jr.

tered recreation program on a county-wide basis with lead-
ership from the county superintendent’s office.

R. S. Boulter, county superintendent, and the superin-
tendents of the thirteen local districts, growing increasingly
more aware of the need for play programs and facilities in
the rural schools, were convinced that leadership' could be
provided on a county-wide basis experimentally if resources
were pooled. In September 1951, a trained recreation workcr
was added to the special service staff of the county system
with the assignment to experiment with and deve10p pro-
grams in nine of the most isolated schools.

The schoolmen agreed that the most logical starting point
was a plan to initiate programs in the elementary grades.
Most of the schools with high school grades usually had a
teacher who could coach standard sports such as softball,

‘ basketball and volleyball; however, organized play for the

elementary grades was almost completcly absent.

Two schools voiced a preference for direct service pro-
grams of physical education whereby the county director of
recreation would act as a visiting teacher and take the vari-
ous grades for physical education once a week. Seven schools
favored the director’s plan for demonstration programs in
recreational games. The aim of the demonstration program
was to introduce new activities to pupils and teachers. For
the children, the objective was to present as many group-
play activities as they could profitably learn. For the teach-
ers, the objcctive was to provide them with new ideas and
skills so that playground duty, lunch hours, rainy-day re-

427

cesses, and bus-waiting time could be used to the children’s
best advantage. The large majority of teachers agreed to
take part in the demonstration sessions along with the chil-
dren. The recreation director worked out a schedule ena-
bling him to spend part of a day each week with each of thirty
classroom groups and their teachers, thus reaching five hun-
dred children ranging from first through eighth grades.

Teachers took to the idea with a spirit of cooperation and
entered into the program enthusiastically. Oneteacher in
particular, close to retirement age, participated in the activi-
ties so eagerly that she became a source of concern to the
recreation director who feared she might not be able to get
to school the following day.

To supplement the demonstration sessions, bulletins con-'

taining instructions for the most popular of the activities
were distributed frequently, and special issues were pub-
lished during the holiday seasons. Suggestions for parties
and programs at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas,
with ideas for themes, adapted games, crafts, stories and
other related projects, proved to be useful to teachers har-
ried by pressures of planning, classroom holiday activities.

During eastern Texas rain-and—mud months of January
and February, rural schools become the center of all activi-

ties, as children must be kept indoors during recesss and
lunch-time. The recreation director found that ideas for
rainy-day activities were quite popular and he took the 0p-
portunity to introduce some of the less vigorous recreation
activities such as dramatics, paper and pencil games, desk
relays, singing games, dramatized stories and similar ac-
tivities which require little space and are relatively quiet.
Hasty research was done to dig out games that would tie into
the curriculum. Teachers soon found popular new ways to
teach reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic through play.

The demonstration program became a major service of
the new county program. The recreation director kept a rec—
ord of the different games and activities he was able to in-
troduce; and he found his original repertory increased con-
siderably when the tally exceeded five hundred.

The p0pularity of this program soon brought requests for
further services. The range of activities was extended to
include high-school groups with interests in recreational ac-
tivities other than sports; and soon dramatics, singing, and

 

428

square dancing became popular where local customs per-
mitted. The county recreational service found many other
opportunities to offer help to the rural areas.

Inter-scholastic competition among elementary and junior
high schools in Texas is managed under state organization
rules, but administered by local personnel. Sports compe-
titions, spelling, typing, arithmetic, and declamation con-
tests, and similar events are available to all rural schools
desiring to participate. The county recreation director found
himself in an excellent position to act as coordinator for this
program and added this service to his portfolio. The fact
that he traveled throughout the county regularly made this a
logical appointment.

Some of the smaller schools found themselves left out of
sports competitions since they rarely had enough pupils to
fill out required team rosters or meet rules of eligibility.
One team consisted of fourth and fifth graders and a single
sixth grader; another team’s first baseman, catcher and
pitcher were sixth grade girls, and so on. The county di-
rector was able to arrange for several of these small schools
to play softball and other sports among themselves. The
games afforded the children a rare chance to visit with chil-
dren from areas similar to their own; and each game became
an event for which the entire host-school would turn out.
The competitive spirit was high, but there was more fun than
perfection in the Smith County “no-team-at-all” league.

As an interpretation of the school’s work, demonstrations
to parent-teacher groups were an important part of the
county director’s work. Frequent presentations of activities.
of the school-centered recreation program were given with
the children taking part. Many times the director was able
to work in a little social recreation for the parents too so that
the idea of recreation was passed on a little further. It was
gratifying to see teachers, parents, and school-comlnittee'
men joining with children in a “Lion Hunt” or a game of
“Who’s the Leader?”

A vitally significant beginning step.was taken in the direc*
tion of extending the services of the county program into the
rural community. The school board and the superintendent
of Swan School saw need for a more adequate playground
The county recreation director was invited to consult witl
the board, and possibilities and alternatives were discussed
The school had ample space but lacked funds. The direct01
took on the responsibility of drawing up plans for a multiple
purpose playground that could meet the needs of the fort)
children in the school and also serve as a community parl
for the pe0ple living in the vicinity. Plans included picnit
benches under shade trees, an outdoor fireplace, horseshor
pits, a softball diamond, and multiple-use courts for basket
ball, volleyball, and other games for adults. Court dimen
sions were planned so that they might be shortened for us:
with the children. The general layout was so planned tha
most of the work could be done by members of the commu
nity with a minimum of expensive equipment and labor. Th1
school board enthusiastically adopted the plan; and witl
this action an important step in county-community relation:
was taken, a step that might well be a precedent in future co
operation between the Smith County schools and the loca
districts.

RECREATIor

No recreation program is complete without music. The
county system was fortunate in having two competent music
teachers who visited rural schools regularly and conducted
theoretical and recreational music activities. While city
children often have the Opportunity to present demonstra-
tions of their year’s work to their communities, rural chil-
drcn do not. Plans were laid by the county director to work
in cooperation with the Tyler municipal recreation depart-
ment in presenting a series of Christmas music broadcasts
from the county courthouse. In the weeks before Christmas,
choral singing by children of Tyler city schools, church
groups, and children of the county schools was presented to
the public through a public address system. Traditional
carols and holiday songs drifted out over the city square and
added sparkle to the Christmas spirit of citizens of Tyler.
Thirty different groups took part in the caroling; half of the
groups were composed of rural school children who rarely
had the opportunity to sing in public.

The grand climax of the Smith County school recreation
program’s first year came appr0priately through music.

During National Music Week, in May, the first Smith County
schools’ festival of music was held at Arp School. The di-

rector of recreation, together with all of the music teachers
in the county, began planning for the event early in March.
For two months, children in all parts of the county prac-
ticed and rehearsed in choral, instrumental, dancing and

dramatic groups in preparation for the most colorful county-
wide event in recent years.

The city of Tyler, through its superintendent of parks
and recreation, Robert L. Shelton, lent its portable stage and
the services of the city electrician. Parent and student groups
set up refreshment stands and children from Arp School dec-
orated the spacious school lawn with red, white, and blue

streamers to fit the theme of the Spring Festival of Ameri-
can Music.

At six o’clock on the evening of May 1, yellow school buses
began to arrive from all corners of Smith County, loaded
with children in gay costumes and springtime best. From
as far away as fifty miles, children from eight schools, their
parents and their teachers assembled to give harmonious
evidence of their skills in music and related arts, to the key-
note of “Let music swell the hreeze. . . .”

Two hundred children took part in the festival and twice
as many parents, teachers, and friends watched their charges
proudly as they sang, played and danced under the fused

beams of floodlights and East Texas stars. The program was ‘

a spectacular success as a “first” and a tribute to the'hard
work of the county’s music supervisors. For the children
who took part, the festival was an important experience in
sharing fun and work; for the county, it was a living demon-
stration that pe0plc in remote areas can come together, de-
spite distances, to share in common pursuits.

By the time the year drew to a close, the influence of the
county-wide school recreation program had been felt in
twelve of the county’s thirteen schools. The festival drew
many school children and teachers together. Over eight hun-

dred different demonstrations and class sessions in recrea-

I tion activities had been given. More than forty different

SEPTEMBER 1954

classroom groups had been reached and a total of almost a
thousand different children and their teachers had taken
part in the program. Traveling in all directions throughout
the county at the rate of four-hundred miles a week, the
county director of recreation drove a total of twelve thousand
miles in the interests of “recreation for all.”

The enthusiastic reSponses by children, teachers and
school officials gave witness to the impact of the program.
The school superintendents voted to continue the program
another year and a permanent job analysis for the post of
county director of recreation and physical education was
drawn up. Recreation had earned its right to be a part of
the school program.

It is important to note that while the first year’s program
was experimental in nature, it had not been undertaken
without purpose and a sound philos0phy of recreational
values. Early in the year, a statement of purpose was drawn
up and shared with the superintendents and teachers. It
pointed out that the recreation program was intended for all
who so desired to take part. Activities were to be of a co-
Operative, participating nature so that every child could
have a part to play, at the level of his own skill. While com-
petition is important in life, it would not be emphasized to
the point of excluding anybody. Training in skills for their
own sake Was to be minimized and, instead, a spirit of co-
operative acceptance of everyone was to be developed. Ac-
tivities of a co-educational, total-group nature were to be
emphasized, rather than separating boys and girls in the
usual play patterns or breaking down classrooms into sub-
groupings according to skill levels. Every opportunity to
help boys and girls play and learn together in an accepting,
cooperative and, h0pefully, democratic setting was to he
utilized in the program.

A belief in the vital roles of play and recreation in child-
hood education was the basis of the program and was im-
plied in every activity. This belief was interpreted in a
letter sent to participating teachers:

Play as physical education, the development of physical motor
skills, is well known. The role of play as a means of helping children
develop and become skillful in group relationships is not so well
understood, yet play remains as one important teaching tool in helping
children develop into well-adjusted citizens of their communities. A]-
most all teachcrs have found play to be a handy resource in pre-
senting facts to be mastered—spelling bees, number games, and quiz
contests of various kinds are old stand-bys of alert teachers. Play as
recreation, a refreshing change in the routine of the day, has demon-
strated its worth as reflected in the shining faces and happy sounds
of children coming in from the playground. The school has a respon-
sibility in all of these directions as the primary educational agency
in today’s community.

I

This is the report of how one rural school system took up
this challenge. The particular plans and methods described
cannot, of course, be found appr0priate for all rural sys-
tems; however, perhaps the Smith County story may be a
source of thought to other systems who desire to point up

their vital place in the providing of balanced lives for rural
children.

In the words of Joseph Lee: “School is invaluable in form-
ing the child to meet actual social Opportunities and condi-
tions. Without the school, he will not grow up to fit our in-
stitutions. Without play, he will not grow up at all.”

City-Sohool
Cooperation
in LIMA

SINCE 1924, when a board of recreation was first appointed
in Lima, Ohio, city and school authorities have shared
the cost of providing a community recreation program. Lima
is one of the comparatively few cities in which the city di-
rector of recreation has also served as director of physical
education and health in the city schools.*

C00peration between the two boards has been based pri-
marily upon a verbal understanding, although a few oper-

ating policies were adopted, such the following:

It is understood that any school activity has priority over any adult
program in use of school facilities. Schedules of activities for young-
sters of school age will be worked out by faculties of schools. Princi-
pals and directors of recreation will then determine school facilities
available for recreation programs.

Following a suggestion, made in 1953, that a combined
meeting of the school and recreation boards be held to study
various program phases and to deve10p a general statement
of policy, several points needing clarification were presented
to the boards for consideration. Among them were:

1. What contracting party shall be responsible for the care
of the buildings during the summer playground period?

2. Who shall determine the placement of sand-boxes, back-
stops, and so on?

3. Shall classrooms be opened to the use of the recreation
department?

4. Who shall assume the cost of replacements and repairs?
5. Shall the board of education employees take time from
their regular work to keep those areas used by the recrea-
tion department clean and safe?

6. Does the responsibility of the recreation department be-
gin with the opening of the playground each day and cease
with its closing in the evening?

Relative to the use of gymnasiums:

1. Gym shoes are required by students during the day when
playing in the gyms. Shall adults engaged in games or dances
be required to follow the same ruling?

* The National Recreation Association believes that the entire time
of a director or superintendent should be given to recreation. There
are few situations in which the superintendent of recreation also serves
as supervisor of physical education in the schools. The Association
maintains that recreation is enough of a job to be full-time.

430

2. Was the use of school gymnasiums by the recreation de-

partment a part of the original agreement between the city
of Lima and the board of education?

3. At present we are receiving fifty cents per hour for the
use of gym facilities. Is it the opinion of the board of educa-
tion that this fee is adequate to cover maintenance costs?

4. Shall coke machines be allowed in the schools for rec-

reation groups? (These are prohibited during the regular
school day.)

Additional t0pics were related to the respective responsi-
bilities of the two departments for specific functions. In
preparation for the meetings, excerpts were made of material
appearing in The American School Superintendency** re-
lating to the participation and cooperation of boards of edu-
cation in promoting community recreation.

The statement of relationship and its specific application,
presented below, was adopted by the Lima board of educa-
tion in October, 1953. A statement of this type should prove
useful in many communities, even where the recreation pro-
gram is not jointly financed and where the recreation execu-
tive is not also in charge of the school physical education
program.

1. The recreation program is basically °educational in nature.

2. The board of education shall promote community recreation,
through such means as are within its power, as a part of the educa-
tional responsibility.

3. Public school properties shall be available to community recrea-
tion use outside school hours subject to such board of education regu-
lations as will safeguard the public interest.

4. The board of education and Lima city council shall continue to
share on an approximately equal basis the cost of the community rec-
reation program for the city.

5. The department of recreation shall be entirely. responsible for pro-
gram content and program personnel needed to operate the commu-
nity recreation program on school properties.

6. The board of education shall provide school facilities for the opera—
tion of community recreation, at minimum or no cost, and maintain
same.

7. It is understood that any school-sponsored activity shall have pri-

ority over a community program in use of a school facility in case of
confilct In time.

Specific Ways of Continued C00peration and Coordination

l. The board of education shall assume the full salary of the director
of recreation.

2. The board of education shall assume the full salary of the secretary
of the director of recreation.

3. The board of education shall provide office space, utilities and office
supplies for the office of the department of recreation.

4. All school principals shall first determine school needs of all rec-
reation facilities in their buildings and then submit a schedule of such
needs to the director of recreation.

5. The after-school use of all recreation facilities shall be scheduled
through the department of recreation office.

6. The department of recreation shall be responsible for the proper
supervision and use of school facilities needed in the community rec-
reation program.

7. The board of education shall be responsible for all maintenance
and repair of school facilities used in the community recreation pro—
gram.

8. The city of Lima shall make available for school use such public

park facilities that lend themselves to that function, such as practice
and game fields for athletic teams and bands, locker rooms, dresslng

quarters, showers, and so on.

9. The department of recreation shall not permit school students to
participate in recreation athletic league‘s without written permission
of school authorities.

10. The department of recreation shall continue to coordinate all
school and community resources for recreation to the end that the
greatest possihle good is attained.

RECREATION

 

An example of how a recreation departlnent helped to solve one of the many
problems of the elementary school teacher—th at of snpervising school recess.

Son/wedded lime

ASK ANY elementary school teachcr and he will readily agree

that one of his big problems centers around the school
recess period. What is behind this growing problem? How
do the teachers feel about the recess period? Are teachers
entitled to a break in routine? What do children want and
expect in their free time? Do children enjoy running and
playing in a hodgepodge of confusion? Or would they pre-
fer organized games where each child has an opportunity
to play as part of the group?-

Except in a few cases in which the teacher organizes the
rccess pcriods, the teacher generally sends or takes the chil-
dren to the play area and turns them loose to run off pent-
up energies in any way the children see fit. Some will say
this is perfectly all right, that children have a natural in-
stinct to play and can entertain themselves. Children may
have the intuitive desire to play, but it must be developed
and nurtured.

The teachers generally feel (and justifiably so) that re-
cess is a good time for them to get a little breather from
the routine of working with the youngsters. Anyone who
has taught or supervised children knows that it is an ex-
acting job requiring the keenest and highest type of lead-
ership. Shouldn’t the teachers, then, be allowed a few min-
utes of relaxation, as well as the children?

How aboui the children? What is their reaction? The
instance that follows grew and developed because a group
of children felt the need for some type of supervised play.
The children themselves, realizing a problem existed, at-
tempted to do something about it.

In Kansas City, Missouri, there are a number of junior
citizen programs in Operation under the leadership of Miss
Alice Roosevelt of the city’s community services division.
In the schools these junior city clubs are patterned after
the city’s form of government. They elect their own mayor
and council, appoint their city manager and all the other
city officials and commissioners. This is the modern student-

council type of student government in which many more ~

children have the opportunity to serve and grow by par-
ticipation as oflicers and officials in their own school gov-
ernment. It was through the recreation commission of the
St. Vincent’s junior city program that the idea for super-
vised recess came into being. The children felt that they
would enjoy their play periods more if some type of organi-
zation could be fostered. Miss Roosevelt called in the city’s

recreation division and a meeting was scheduled to discuss
the problem.

MR. PETERSON, superintendent of recreation in Emporia,
Kansas, received his master’s degree in recreation from Indi-

ana University, his bachelor’s degree from Hanover College.

SEPTEMBER 1954-

James A. Peterson

 

It was decided jointly, by the children, teachcrs and rec-
reation leaders, that all the children in the sixth, seventh
and eighth grades who were interested in leading games
for the first four grades on the playground during recess
would be given instruction in leadership techniques and
game skills. It was pointed out that only those children in-
terested in learning leadership techniques would be given
the Opportunity for training. It was further explained that
the children taking the training would be required to com-
plete the entire course and take a written examination upon
completion of their work. The children were told that they
would not lose their own recess period because of their work
with the younger grades during their recess. It is believed
that the opportunity for growth and development afforded
these children in taking responsibility for other youngsters
more than offsets the time spent out of regular classes. It
is not practical, however, to consider assigning a junior
leadcr to more than two or three recess periods each week
because the continuity of the leader’s own school classes
must be considered. Each school must deve10p its own
schedule based on specific needs.

My part as the recreation lcader was to set up a training
program to teach these volunteer play leaders. The program
has been revised a little from time to time, as different meth-
ods have been tried, and it should be adapted to fit local
conditions wherever possible.

OUTLINE or TIIE COURSE

Length of training: four weeks, two one-hour meetings
per week, eight sessions in all.

432

Session Eight

1. Award certificates of achievement (and watch the chil-
dren’s faces glow).

SUGGESTIONS

1. Explain to teachers the details of assigning children to
different groups for leadership.

a. Assign leaders to groups by pairs. Children gain con-
fidence by having another youngster standing by to help.
The extra leader can help with the formations, guiding chil-
dren, handling balls, and so on.

b. Assign strong and weak leaders together.

2. At least one or two teachers should be on the grounds
during recess periods for obvious reasons: authority, in case
of injury, to guide and offer assistance to the young leaders,
and over-all supervision.

3. Do not insist that every child play the game. One of the
basic fundamental philosophies of recreation is that recrea-
tion is voluntarily participated in for the enjoyment derived.
Once the child who has been left out sees the fun, he will be
more than happy to play the next time.

4. It will not be necessary to re-teach the games each time
after the children have learned them, but a leader should
be on hand to help start and finish the game.

5. Scheduling leadership classes for a given group should
not exceed two or three times a week, thereby allowing time
for free expression of skills already learned, such as swing-
ing, sliding, climbing, and so on, in addition to the Oppor-
tunity to grow through organized recreation.

6. Children should be encouraged to share with the class
their ideas and experiences for new games.

7. Leaders should keep up their training by learning new
games to teach the youngsters, possibly through a recrea-
tion leaders” club with monthly meetings. a

A problem of major concern is: what games are best for
training these youngsters? It must be kept in mind that the
games will be taught to the first four grades and thercfore
cannot be highly technical or physically hard for partici-
pants. These early elementary children are not too adept at
catching or batting balls or doing some of the more com-
plicated skills such as dribbling or kicking. The following
games are listed in order to give you an idea of some of the
games that have proven successful:

Circle games:

Stride Ball
Slap Jack
Relays:

Line games:
Steal the Bacon
Streets and Alleys

Running games:
Squirrels in the Trees Foot to Foot Relay
Puss in the Corner Over and Under Relay

In addition to the games given for early elementary grades
it is important to include a few for the older age groups.
These can be taught as extras and need not be part of the
regular training. Quiet games that can be played indoors
during inclement weather also are needed.

I feel that here is a golden opportunity for recreation
leaders to offer technical assistance and guidance, if not
leadership, to the hundreds of schools all over the country
which are confronted with problems centering around the
recess or play period, a real chance to help schools in an
area oftentimes neglected because of a lack of the proper
know-how.

A Children’s Theatre Provides Recreation

and Social Education for Local Youngsters.

%ow, BEFORE we decide who’s going
to be Rumpelstiltskin, why don’t
you draw what you think he looks like
on the board?

This may not be exactly the Stani-
slavsky method of teaching acting, but
it’s the one that works with the youngest
members of Syracuse University’s Chil-
dren’s Theatre.

rector of dramatic activities at the uni-
versity, the theatre, which is open to
Syracusans aged five through seventeen,
has been active ever since. Professor
Falk sees the Children’s Theatre pri-
marily as a public service of the uni-
versity: “It is part of our belief in, and
attempt to promote, the theatre as a true
communal activity—a part of the peo-
ple’s everyday life and not something
connected only with Broadway.”
According to the stated policy of the
' Children’s Theatre, in the course of
training the student is taught:

a more integral part of the community
by contributing to its recreation and
education program.

Many of the youngsters who become
“regulars” in the group continue their
interest in dramatics after high school
by enrolling at the university, and some
of them even return to Children’s The-
atre as teachers. “I enjoyed coming
here so much when I was a little girl,”
one of the instructors recalled, “I hated
to stop. The next best thing was teach-
ing a class myself.”

Since its founding, the group has had
a varied organization. Teachers have
been graduate students, drama instruc-
tors, paid professionals; the location
has ranged from rooms in campus
buildings to downtown and neighbor-

dren draw their concepts of their roles.

hood theaters. But over-all supervision
has always rested in the university
drama department.

At present, classes are held every
Saturday morning on the university
campus. Teachers are recruited pri-
marily from graduate and undergrad-
uate students majoring in radio and
television, speech and drama, and edu-
cation. They all have a common interest
in working with children or in dramatic
activities——-usually both. . And they all
agree that nothing is more challenging
or rewarding.

Classes are run on a semester basis of
ten to twelve weeks. The students are
attracted through announcements in
the local newspapers and radio and tele-
vision stations, as well as by the enthu-
siasm of participating youngsters. Total
enrollment has ranged from twenty-five
to as high as four hundred; about one
hundred is considered best, with the
present facilities, to allow for individual
attention for all.

Each child pays a registration fee of
five dollars per term. This money helps
cover such items as materials, costumes,
teachers’ token salaries and traveling
expenses. Oflspring of faculty members
are given a reduced rate and arrange-
ments are made so that talented children
who do not have the necessary funds are
able to join.

For the tiniest thespians, the five- and
six-year-olds, there’s a very informal
class in creative dramatics. This is
where the question of who’s going to
play Rumpelstiltskin came up. The
teacher reads a well-known fairy story
to the children. Then they discuss it
and decide who will play each part. One
little tot may bluntly announce that
she’s the princess and refuse to give up

433

star billing, but in most cases, social
pressure from her contemporaries and
tactful handling by'the teacher avoid
any overt warfare. The production con-
sists of the children'acting out the story,
supplying their own dialogue and ac-
tions. This form of self-expression gives
them a chance to get used to the idea
of acting, casting and the other phases
of production.

The general dramatics class is for the
older children who can absorb more
formalized direction. Here the empha-
sis is also on “learning through doing.”
These youngsters choose the play they
wish to work on, or even write their
own. Then, if Johnny doesn’t under-
stand “stage-left,” the whole group steps
for discussion and explanation.

This year the students in the high-
school-age group decided they wanted
their classes run on a seminar-like basis.
“Many of us have been coming to chil-
dren’s theatre for years,” explained a
blonde teen-ager, “and so we felt that
we would get more from hearing au-
thorities in the field, such as actors, di-
rectors and so on, talk to us than from
continuing in regular classes.”

The puppet group attracts children
of all ages. They learn to make their
own puppets out of papier maché and
use them to put on puppet shows, some
of them original. This semester they
are also constructing their own stage.

Feeling like a snowflake or a growing
flower is a common occurrence in the
creative dance class for younger girls.
Here they are taught the fundamental
exercises,.p0sitions and movements of
modern dance. “I am on the first level,”
a ballet-slippered miss will proudly an-
nounce as she lies prone on the floor.
Then the miniature Martha Grahams
are encouraged to express themselves
by creating their own choreography.

One of the newest groups is that in
radio and television. The seven- to
twelve-year-olds in this class have the
advantage of field trips through the uni-
versity and downtown radio and TV
stations to inspect the equipment and
see live shows in production. One of
the local stations recently carried a TV
show written by radio students for the
Children’s Theatre, which sponsored
and produced it. In this group, Donny a
fifth grader, can speak familiarly of the

merits of Norman Corwin, while eight-
year-old Patsy adds to her vocabulary
terms like “boom,” “fade-out” and
“pan-shot.”

In addition to the small class projects,
Children’s Theatre presents at least one
major production a year, drawing its
cast and part of its stage crew from the
children enrolled. With a box office,
printed posters, costumes, scenery and
scheduled rehearsals, it becomes a big
event for the youngsters and gives them
an opportunity to put into practice all
they’ve learned in their classes. In re-
cent years the major productions have
included such well-known children’s
favorites as Pinocchio, Alice in Won-
derland, Bluebeard and the classic Snow

White.

The Children’s Theatre provides
more than just an outlet for young-
sters’ tendencies toward make-believe.
It is also an important factor in social
education—teaching poise, c00pera-
tion, responsibility and developing self-
expression and creative abilities. A
similar project could be a worthwhile
part of any community’s recreational
program.

 

KNOW YOUR UNITED NATIONS

Plan a community-wide celebration for United Nations
Day, October 24, and use it for community education on
this important subject. From the outset, seven years ago,
the purpose of UN Day has been to increase public under-
standing of and support for the work of the United Nations.

Fundamentally, a broad public understanding and support
is an awareness on the part of the individual American that

he is part of the United Nations, and that the ultimate suc-
cess of the UN depends upon his SUpport, his faith, and his

determination to see it succeed.
The program for this year, based on the theme The UN

Depends on You, calls for public information projects, popu-
lar programs, publicity, and international exchanges with
the emphasis on religious programs for the weekend because
UN Day falls on Sunday. Local programs should be suffici-
ently broad so as to enable the entire community to partici-
pate and learn more about the UN. Imaginative displays and
exhibits are one of the best means of promoting greater pub—
lic understanding of the need for international cooperation.
The public listens best by seeing, and most stores, banks
and other places of business are willing to contribute display
space.

Start a project with your youth groups, since they are
usually more active and interested in world affairs—the

434

future success or failure of the UN will affect every youth
in America. Their activities inevitably involve the interest
and participation of parents. Be prepared with books, stor-
ies, articles, posters, photographs and other objects which
can help the young person to see the world about him more
clcarly. Write to the U. S. Committee for United Nations
Day, 816 Twenty-first Street NW, Washington, D. C., for
their leaders’ guide and other materials prepared as tools for
planning United Nations Day programs and projects of
every kind. You will be interested to note that their sug-
gested program activities lie within the field of recreation,
illustrating once again the valuable contribution which rec-
reation can make in the promotion of good international
relations.

The majority of church organizations and groups are UN
supporters, and the health center, bankers’ association, labor
groups, and aeronautics association are all concerned. Small
units working together will spell success for a large commu-
nity-wide UN Day program. In 1953, more than 6,000 com-
munities throughout the United States participated in United
Nations Day observances. Mayors in towns of more than
2,500 population have again been asked to proclaim United
Nations Day and to appoint local committees. Offer your

services to your mayor!

adult groups and to your special golden-
age groups. It could be worked out for
hospitals, too—as well as church and

I , ARM CHAIR TBA VELER

  

1A EVERY NOW and then, a recreation depart-

ment thinks up a new idea in the way of
program entertainment that hits the jack pot right off the
bat! This was the case when the Santa Barbara Recreation
Department decided to inaugurate “The Arm Chair Trav-
eler” as a program activity. While we had expected from
seventy-five to one hundred people at the first showing, we
were surprised with an attendance of two hundred seventy-
five interested persons. During the spring-fall series (nine-
teen weeks) the total attendance grew to 4,425, with 233 as
an average weekly attendance. The series was intended pri-
marily for older adults, for homemakers, and for those who
had retired or who lived alone.

There are, as we know, movies and more movies! They
are nothing new, for they have been shown periodically by
hundreds of recreation departments. The question was, how-
ever: How could a program of this type be made more in-
teresting so that it would draw the greatest possible number
of people? We had to think of a new approach, something a
little different, a program that would sell itself. First, the
name was very important—it would be a better selling point
to give it a name that would attract the eye and be descriptive
of the activity. Rather than merely announcing that movies
would be shown we thought it would be far more effective
to call it “The Arm Chair Traveler.”

It doesn’t cost anything to name a program, but what about
the pictures themselves, the kind that would appeal to the
greatest number of persons, black and white or color sound
films? Where would we get a projector and a large screen
and sound equipment so that the picture could be seen and
heard without strain? Who would operate the projector?
We had no funds with which to meet these expenses. George

.sor of Civic Recreation Center, Santa Barbara, California.

Louise E. Lowry

H. Adams, superintendent of recreation for Santa Barbara,
said laughingly, “Put on your thinking caps.”

From there we started! No funds, no projector or screen,
and no films were at hand. The department assumed respon-
sibility for a meeting place, since we are fortunate in having
a lovely recreation center, and also offered the professional
leadership.

It called for a selling job, with interest and enthusiasm
as the basic tools. To make a long story short, the projector,
equipment and large screen were borrowed throngh the cour-
tesy of the audio-visual aids department of the city schools.
Members of this department were very willing to cooperate
with us in a program of this type because of the urgent need
in recent years to provide satisfying recreation programs
that do not sap too much of the older person’s energy. It is
good to plan so that part of the leisure time of this age group
can be spent in an activity that is interesting and entertain-
ing as well as educational.

It was decided, in theme with our new and attractive name,
to present a travelogue series of color and sound pictures
showing the highlights and beauty of countries all over the

~ world, to illustrate the lives and customs of foreign peoples.

A recreation department staff member; handles the pro-
jector. He runs the picture off first, prior to the program, to
take care of any breaks in the film and to set up the sound
equipment and screen so that the program will go off with-
out a flaw. “Plan your work and then work your plan” is a
good motto to follow.

The pictures were shown once a week, every Tuesday after-
noon from 2:30 to 3:30 P.M., in a ten-week series. The al-
location and arrangement of the series was done in advance
because we had other groups and conventions scheduled to
use the auditorium at other times. However, I think if cer-
tain programs run over too long a period they tend to be-
come a common thing—like having turkey every day for

435

PROGRAM

dinner. It fails to remain something special. This was one
of our subtle selling points—to stop at the peak before inter-
est in the program started to decrease.

It was found that there are several ways in which modern
picture reels may be obtained. Travel agencies and the rail-
road and bus companies have been very helpful, as have the
large oil companies. Most cities or towns have their pho-
tography enthusiasts who are usually eager to show their
personal travel pictures. Some who have traveled abroad
make interesting presentations of their experiences and at
the same time enjoy the distinction such platform appear-
ances give them.

 

h.

Folks filing out of recreation center after seeing Arm
Chair Traveler. The series was planned for older adults.

In our case, the Joe Sears Travel Service of Santa Bari
bara has provided many beautiful pictures at no cost to us.
Mr. Sears, a very civic-minded person, has been most c00per-
ative in lending us reels of travel by air, steamship and
railroad.

Older pe0ple who have traveled through various parts of
the world have an Opportunity to reminisce, and those whose
travels have been limited are privileged to take the trip
vicariously.

And, by the way, any recreation department which would
care to show the beautiful color-sound motion picture Santa
Barbara—Pacific Paradise may do so by writing to the Santa
Barbara Chamber of Commerce well in advance. They will
be glad to lend you their thirty-minute reel.

Publicity plays a very important part in the continued
success of the program, as well as in launching it. The public
is becoming-more and more concerned about the aging; and
their needs and activities are news. Effective publicity meth-
ods can help to keep the community informed and interested.
The usual media, newspapers and radio and television sta-
tions, are usually most c00perative, and provide very valu-
able publicity channels. Shut-ins, whether in their own
homes, institutions or rooming houses can be reached
through these methods of publicity.

i We also used posters in key places where older persons
lived or visited frequently; and clerks at the hotels obliged
us by putting our mimeographed announcements into the
mail boxes of permanent guests, and also made them avail-

able in the lObby. Announcements were distributed to res- '

436

taurants and cafeterias and to neighborhood rooming houses.

The Santa Barbara public library also played an impor-
tant part in the program. Its staff graciously cooperated with
the recreation department by mimeographing attractive
weekly brochures listing a dozen or more books (with call

numbers) pertaining to the countries to be shown. These
lists proved very p0pular.

At our first showing, although we had three hundred per
cent more guests than anticipated, we took time to have each
one register his name and address, and our department then
sent out mimeographed postal cards to each saying: “We
hope you enjoyed the program and that you will be able to
attend regularly.” A space was left on the card to type in
the names and each card was personally hand-signed. A
postscript was added——a reminder in the form of “See you
next Tuesday!” In this way the message was made more
personal; and, by the way, it paid off! It made them feel
welcome and stimulated them to return and bring their
friends. This personal recruiting by the first members has
been a big factor in the growth of the group. It is what we
call indirect salesmanship. The personal touch should not
be underestimated—it should be used not only in corre-
spondence, but also in having members of the staff available
to greet the people pleasantly when they arrive, to listen to
their comments—complimentary or otherwise—to show an
interest in what they have to say and to thank them for the
interest in their program. Their confidence must be secured
quickly so that the recreation leader can discover what thei1
real interests and capacities are, and what type of pictures
they would like to see in the future. One thing that should
be kept in mind is that pictures should be chosen from an
educational standpoint so as not to conflict with the motion
picture houses in your community. At the present time, the
going is an uphill grade for the theaters—and the recreation
department is not interested in competing with them and

does not desire to obtain pictures similar to those they show
without their approval.

Activities of this type must be conducted on a modified
basis, particularly as to theme and length of time. Oldel

people cannot be rushed or they become confused. They
must set the pace, and we must follow.

Later, when we launched a new series, we again sent out
cards to those who were on our mailing list during the initial

program. We stated that we were notifying them because of
the interest they had shown at the former series.

When the pe0ple are seated in the auditorium, I greel
them as a group—very informally and perhaps with some
bit of humor whenever the Opportunity arises. They like it—

and it makes members of the audience feel that they are a
part of the family.

In financing the program, cooperation was given by the
travel agencies, the visual education department and the city
public library. The actual output of money has been practi-
cally nil, except for a dollar or solfor some film transporta-
tion charges, depending upon the part of the country from
which they were sent. In using our own fine recreation center
in which to show them, and a staff member to run them, we
have no rental or projectionist fees to pay.

We have made no charges whatsoever; the program is
open to all residents and visitors. It is for adults and, al-
though there is no age limit, it has attracted the older persons
primarily. Many appreciative enthusiasts, who were de-
lighted with the pictures, suggested that a small fee be
charged; but, I have found throughout my experience, if a
program of this type can function without making a charge,
so much the better. The handling of money is a headache to
the recrcation department, and the only time a charge is
made is when it is necessary in order to defray the actual

PROGRAM

expenses. If, for instance, a request should come from the
greater majority of persons to see a special film, which we
would have to rent outright, then a charge would have to be
made to meet this expense.

Each community should select and adapt different ideas
that are appropriate to its own needs and resources. There
are always individuals and groups, in communities of all
sizes, who would be interested in a program with as great an
appeal as ours. They should be given an opportunity to con-
tribute their services by assisting the supervisor in charge.

7‘0“: W a PLAY READING GROUP?

 

THE PLAY reading group can fill a real need. Some will

argue that since plays were meant to be acted and have
no real life without audience response, anything less than
performance is a mockery of the author and whatever ideas
he may be trying to convey. Let no one think any the less
of group reading because its means of enjoying plays is sec-
ondary, falling short of the full glory of public presentation.

Many prefer to enjoy their reading of plays in private;
but, with all due respect, they do not know what they are
missing. A play is not a novel. A good play script is a terse
collection of words compared with the richness of descrip-
tive detail in a novel. Then, too, the development of the
drama itself depends upon the interplay among the various

characters and their effect upon each other. Granted consid- ’

erable talent and a broad understanding of character, it is
possible for a mature play reader to understand most of the
author’s meaning by reading the various parts to himself.
Yet the interpretations of the characters, however fully real-
ized by the reader, would be but the conjectures of one mind.
Entirely missed would be the delightful surprises of sharing
the enriching experience of several minds meeting on that
common ground. Individuality, the important elusive in-
gredient in the make-up of every single character, will be
more readily seen and recognized by several pairs‘ of eyes
and the wider experience of the group. There you have the
best argument for enjoying the reading of plays aloud in a
group.

Start with your keenest members. Four or five will do.
It’s a good idea to let each, of them read the whole play
through beforehand. This saves long explanations bcfore
the group reading begins. It is well to have as many copies
of the play as possible. Don’t just depend on your public
library. Ask your friends; they may happen to have a copy

in a collection on their shelves. Weekly evening meetings .

should be planned-at least a month ahead. Contrast in the

choice of plays and regularity in meeting are the two most

important factors in keeping the group together.

,; SEPTEMBER 1954

The group leader might select people to try certain parts in
the first act. There should be no favoritism among the read-
ers. The enthusiasm of every member should be nurtured.
It is even helpful to pass the role of leader around the group
from week to week. Parts should be changed about during
the course of the reading. Give those with little experience
a chance to read sections of the large parts. Let the experi-

 

enced see what they can do on sight with the small roles.

' Tlie’iiiost important thing is the developmcnt of an original

approach to all roles. The benefits will be ’appreciated later
in preparing roles for stage performance.

0pcn discussion at the end of each evening’s reading will
help everyone toward a clear interpretation. It is well to
have this discussion completely informal. From time to time
draw others into the circle. Some of the group enthusiasm is
bound to rub off on these new members and new vitality will
be felt in the club’s activitics.

Group spirit is a tender plant; let it grow!

Congress Special

Something special and unique at the
St. Louis meeting will be the preview
of the two-year study, recently comple-
ted, of the recreation leadership and
training needs in the southern region
of the United States. This is the first
time that such a presentation will be
made at a national Congress. Indeed,
it is the first study of its kind ever to
be conducted in the recreation field. Dr.
William G. McGlothlin, consultant on
professional programs for the Southern
Regional Education Board, and Dr.
Doak S. Campbell, president of Florida
State University and a member of the
Southern Board, will (1) reveal some of
the highlights of the recreation study
and (2) interpret the interesting and
unusual movement underway in the
South for c00perative professional edu-
cation programs on a regional basis.
Answers to many questions have been
found in the Southern Regional Recrea-
tion Study, such as: What is the status
of organized recreation in the South?
What of the future? What are recrea-
tion workers like? What are the con-
ditions under which recreation workers
must serve? What are the educational
needs of the recreation profession?
Many problems have been identified
and defined with recommendations for
their solution. The Southern Regional
Education Board has engaged the tem-
porary services of Dr. William J. Tait,
director of recreation curriculum at
Florida State University, to help carry
out some of the recommendations.

One of the first steps toward a plan
of action taken by the Southern Re-
gional Education Board is the planning
of a conference scheduled to be held
in Atlanta, Georgia, in the middle of
November. College and university ad-
ministrators, recreation educators, pro-
fessional recreation workers and emc
ployers in the various fields represented
in the study will be invited. Repre-
sentatives from these reSponsible groups
are expected, among other things, to
pr0pose apprOpriate action for (1) re-
cruitments of students, (2) the expan-

sion of undergraduate curricula for rec-
reation and (3) the strengthening of
graduate recreation programs.

The southern region is a vast area
composed of fourteen states and con-
taining 45,000,000 peOple, twenty-nine
per cent of the p0pulation of the United
States. Southern industry, p0pulation,
urbanization and suburbanization are
increasing rapidly. These and other
factors are combining to affect the
changing conditions and pattern of liv-
ing. With these changes emerge a con-
stant and ever-increasing need and de-
mand for recreation facilities, services
and professionally trained leadership.
Although the growth of recreation in
the South has been rapid, the need for
it has been more so. Like Alice in Won-
derland it seems that recreation must
run twice as fast to stay where it is. If
we know our Alice, however, she will
continue to increase the pace until the
need is more adequately met.

* 'll- * *

The National Advisory Committee on
Recruitment, Training and Placement
of Recreation Personnel has given much
time and thought to the arrangement of
the personnel activities to which you
may look forward at the National Rec-
reation Congress in St. Louis.

Jerry Donovan, assistant director of
the Civil Service Assembly of the United
States and Canada, will be on hand to
spearhead a meeting on “Job Analysis”
and to answer questions involving civil
service. There are many important and
complicated questions here. What are
yours? We would suggest that you send
them to us in advance. “Visual Re-
sources for In-service Training” is an-
other session you cannot afford to miss.

Ted Deppe, recreation educator, has
enlisted the interest of the Visual Aids
Department at Indiana University and
materials and equipment are being
made available for demonstration and
exhibit purposes. Indiana University
has one of the oustanding visual aids
departments in the country and it is
significant that some of the students ma-
joring in recreation take a minor in this
specialized field which has so much to
offer to the recreation profession. An-
other timely session will be “Planning

W. C. Sutherland

and Evaluating the Undergraduate Cur-
riculum.” Charles K. Brightbill, of 11-
linois University, who is chairman of
the National Recreation Association’s
committee on undergraduate education,
will chair the meeting.

The National Advisory Committee on
Recruitment, Training and Placement
will also hold its third annual meeting
at the Congress. Its activities will be
evaluated and plans for the future will
be considered. This is a crucial period
for the recreation profession, and the
committee will continue to study im-
portant problems related to recruitment,
education and placement. What has
been done toward the solution of these
problems? What are the most pressing
needs and what is being done to meet
them? What approaches, methods and
procedures shall be used? These con-
cerns will continue to receive the atten-
tion of the committee which, in turn,
solicits the assistance and suggestions
of all professional workers and friends
of the recreation movement.

News in Brief

I The July bulletin of the Illinois Rec-
reation Association carried a study,
“Accidents on Recreational Facilities,”
by John Montgomery, graduate student
in recreation on leave of absence from
the Oakland, California, recreation de«
partment. One of the general conclu-
sions was: “Playing in the apparatus
areas was the activity most often en-
gaged in when accidents occurred. The
young age of the individuals, their lack
of coordination and motor skills'are
contributing factors to the high inci-
dence of accidents. Often there is too
wide an age variance among the par-
ticipants. Supervision of this area of
play is often not as great as the activity
warrants. Types of play and equipment
are often hazarduous.” In all, the study
contains many interesting statistics.

I At the New Jersey Public Recreation
Association spring meeting, members
heard a panel of five experts urge closer
cooperation and oint planning for new
schools for total community use. Dr.
Felix McCormick, associate professor
at Columbia University and moderator
of the panel, in summing up the main
points stated that all who will use the
schools—"teachers, parents, adult stu-
dents, recreation workers, the health
inspector, and even the town clerk who
will use them as voting places—should
be consulted by municipal authorities
if successful planning is to result.

I In Opelika, Alabama, the city plan-
ning board, guided by its land-use plan,
reviews all the proposed land acquisi-
tion. If, for example, the school plans
to buy land, the board will recommend
that the city buy the additional land
necessary to fully provide for recrea-
tion. Thus the community is rapidly
acquiring sufficient play space well lo-
cated in relationship to the schools and
to the population.

I A very interesting and timely article
by Frederick Lewis Allen, “Crisis in the
Suburbs,” appeared in the July issue of
Harper’s Magazine. The article extols
the need for bold future planning for
communities to allow breathing room
and recreation. Mr. Allen says: “. . .
l have been repeatedly struck by the lag
in preparing for the future which one
finds in the story of community after
community. . . . I suggest as a first or-
der of business, for every suburban gov-
ernmental body and for every suburban
citizens’ association, a consideration of
ways and means for preserving open

land for the beneat of succeeding gen-

I In Brockton, Massachusetts, there’s a
big day in the offing for senior citizens
on September 19 when “Golden-Age
Day” will be celebrated at the famous
Bockton Fair. The Brockton Agricul-
tural Society, sponsor of the fair, ex-
tended the invitation to the golden-age
clubs through the Eastern Massachu-
setts Recreation Association. Admission
will be by group only and all program-
ming for the day will be directed for
these groups.

I The Arizona Game and Fish Commis-
sion has now legalized the taking of
rough fish (carp, buffalo, suckers) by
use of bow and arrow on a statewide
basis. The archer may not have other
fishing equipment with him, and he
may not use his equipment within half
a mile of any boat dock, swimming
area, or other place where people are
concentrated.

I Dubuque, Iowa, started an eight-week
morning playground program this sum-
mer for mentally retarded children. The
program was held in one of the parks
and had a day-camp setting. Parents of
the children were very cooperative and
paid for a school bus to pick up the
youngsters and return them after the
program.

I Seventeen schools in Houston, Texas,
remained open this summer to make
available their recreation facilities for
use Without charge. Seven of these
schools have swimming pools. The
schools chosen were in parts of the city
where there were no nearby parks.

' Children in Memphis, Tennessee, are
gctting the thrill of a lifetime as they
climb aboard the cab of a real loco-
motive. The locomotive, given to the
city, was placed in a park to the delight
of local small fry. And far across the
nation, in Tacoma, Washington, other
youngsters are experiencing a similar
thrill'since the Northern Pacific Rail-
way presented locomotive number 1364
to the Metropolitan Park District and
the pe0ple of Tacoma.

I The May issue of Contact, the bul-

many interesting programs planned for
Vermont’s oldsters.

I The after-school playground pro-
gram, sponsored jointly by the recrea-
tion and parks department and the city
schools in Yuma, Arizona, which is in
Operation daily from October to March,
has for its theme “Fun with a Pur-
posc.” The activities serve both ele-
mentary and junior high school stu-
dents and cover a wide range of inter-
ests. The program varies from play-
ground to playground to meet neigh-
borhood conditions; however, the ac-
tivities offered include: informal dra-
lnatics, group games and Sports, tourna-
ments, singing, square and follc danc-
ing, crafts and quict games. Junior
high school students also have dancing,
howling, tennis classes, sportsmen’s
club and camera club, and a rifle club
and archery club will be added. Two of
the interesting features of this program
are: (1) the workshops held for three
hours each month for leaders, many of
whom are teachers, and (2) the wide

use of both adult and student volun-
teers.

RECREATION

 

Creative Rhythmic Movement

for Children
Gladys Andrews. Prentice-Hall, Inc.,
70 Fifth Avenue, New York 11. Pp. 198.
$4.75.

The author, who is at present assist-
ant professor at New York University’s
School of Education, has done a superb
job of writing a direct, comprehensive
book on the ways of using creative
rhythms for boys and girls of elemen-
tary school age. -

So often a book of this kind keeps
stating what the end results should be,
but the reader is still in the dark as to
how these are accomplished. In this
book it is perfectly clear how to do it.

Creativity is stressed as a way of
learning; and rhythmic movement is
the individual’s interpretation of his
thoughts and feelings eXpressed through
the use of the body.

The author says, “There are no pre-
requisites necessary to utilize the knowl-
edge in this book—only a love of chil-
dren and a faith in oncself.”

It is evident that all the material has
been tried and tested and the charming
photographs throughout the book at-
test to the enjoyment with which it was
received by the boys and girls. The
lack of a suitable room, a piano, a rec-
ord player, and so on are usually the
first stumbling block in the way of a
leader who wants to do creative rhythms
with children. These handicaps the au-
thor has neatly disposed of by proving
what can be accomplished in an ordin-
ary school room setting and by the use
of improvised percussion instruments.

There are eleven chapters in the hook
dealing first with the child and what
he is like, and moving on to an analysis
of movement of all types, the develop-
lnent of movement, percussion and
movement, and so on, with a wonderful
closing chapter on “Creativity in the
School Program.” Musical selections,
projects, Specific teaching situations
and the responses of the children to
them are all valuable aids to the reader.

The author stresses the importance
of using creative rhythms as a basis for
the natural progression to folk, social

and other forms of dancing which come
in the middle or later years of child-
hood.

This book should be in the personal
library of elementary school teachers
and recreation leaders for, in most
cases, the work in rhythms for children
is woefully lacking in our physical edu-
cation and recreation programs.

Highly recommended. —- Helen M.
Dauncey, Katherine F. Barker Memorial

The First Book of

Stage Costume and Make-up

Barbara Berk. Franklin Watts, Inc.,
699 Madison Avenue, New York 21,
N.’ Y. Pp. 45. $1.75.

A hook for young actors, very gay
with colored illustrations, which could
be of great help to playground, camp
or community recreation leaders in
planning stunts, skits, carnivals, an am-
ateur circus, treasure hunts, costumed
parades, and other special events where
a touch of make-up, costume and color
will lend drama and glamor to the oc-
casion. It is very well-written, clever,
and has a good index.

Design for Artists and Craftsmen

Louis Wolchonok. Dover Publica-
tions, Inc., New York 1953. Pp. 207,
$4.95.

This fascinating hook teaches you
how to see designs in geometric and
human shapes, in flowers, animals, and
man-made objects. It is a down-to-earth
book that also demonstrates how to start
experimenting with the everyday ob-
jects of today’s living, and with your
interests and activities to achieve crea-
tive design.

The book has a powerful influence,
and you will be tempted to spend many
hours on the exercises which have hecn
prcpared carefully to help you inter-
pret your own ideas. Don’t be surpriscd
to find yourself practicing drawing too!
The author points out that your imagin-
ation will develop as you learn to ob-
serve and experiment.

There are 1,280 superb illustrations
that can be adapted for arts and crafts

objects or used as a reference file. The
text adds an appreciative note to your
understanding of creative design.

As a whole, the book is a never end-
ing course of pleasure, for every time
you go through it you will discover
something new to inSpire you !—Shirley
Sitbert, teacher at New York Univer-

sity and Craft Students League, author
of Craft Workit.

Songs Children Like

Compiled by Association for Child-

Pp. 48. $1.00. (Order from Associa-
tion for Childhood Education Interna-

Collections of folk songs are legion,
but here is one that is not hackneyed,
containing folk songs selected carefully
for their use around the campfire, on
the trail, on the playground, and in the
home.

For those collecting and using inter-
national program material, the songs
from other lands are fresh and lovely.
Included are songs from Iceland, Ja-
pan, China, Denmark, Hawaii, Indo-
nesia, Korea, and thirteen other coun-
tries, besides those from our own folk-
lore.

For all of us, the collection contains
around seventy sparkling, fresh songs,
lullabies, rounds, holiday and work
songs, most of them with complete ac.
companiment. Recommended.

Play-By-Color

Publication address: Wolfe’s Play-
by-Color Books, 986 Sanford Avenue,

Irvington, New Jersey.

This is a set of booklets (seven titles
are now available) presenting one of
the newer easy-to-do “methods” of play-
ing the piano. More accurately, it is
a device for luring children, and also
adults, to the satisfaction of picking out
well-known tunes by striking the keys
to match colors 011 printed notation
with those on charts placed above the
keyboard. Included in the set are col-
lections of nursery songs, Stephen Fos-
ter songs, carols, and hymns. Prices of
the hooklets range from $1.00 to $2.00
each. While this “method” makes no
claim to teach music or to develop skill
in performance, it does aim to draw out
latent interest and stimulate more seri-
ous study.———Gertrude Borchard, Corres-
pondence and Consultation Service,

Basic Concepts
in Hospital Recreation

The HOSpital Recreation Section of
the American Recreation Society, 1420

447

New York Avenue NW, Washington,
D. C. Pp. 26. $1.00.

This is a study accomplished through
the efforts of six people, all committee
members of the Hospital Recreation
Section of the American Recreation
Society Basic Concepts Committee.
These people are: C. C. Bream, Jr.,
chairman, chief, Recreation Division,
Recreation Service, Special Services;
Joseph N. Conlin, chief, Entertainment
and Radio, Recreation Service, Special
Services, Veterans Administration;
Elizabeth Couch, recreation supervisor,
Brooklyn State Hospital; Alice Saliba,
women’s and girls’ secretary, YWCA,
Streator, Illinois; Annabelle Story, rec-
reation training supervisor, American
Red Cross, US. Naval Hospital, Oak-
land, California; Dorothy Taaffe, rec-
reation consultant, American National
Red Cross, Washington, D. C. Publica-
tion was made possible through the fi-
nancial assistance of the Minnesota
Recreation Association.

The growth of organized recreation
as a component part of the total re-
covery of the patient has become more
evident every year. Military, veterans’
and state hospitals today consider rec-
reation a service adjunctive to medical
treatment. Voluntary, municipal and
private hospitals are beginning to rec-
ognize the need for recreation through-
out the country. Owing to this growth,
this study of prevailing concepts of hos-
pital recreation is not only the first of
its kind in the field, but a great and
necessary contribution. Letters were
sent to carefully selected individuals, by
the committee, requesting the benefit of
their thinking.

The study was conducted in five
parts: (1) definition of recreation; (2)
the application of the definition to the
recreation program in a hospital; (3)
the place of the recreation program in
a hospital; (4) the use of medical pre-
scription in relation to the participation
of patients in the recreation program;
(5) the function of the physician in
relation to determining the activities to
be included in the recreation program

for diagnostic groups, for individual
patients.

The report of the study consists of
an analysis of the comments forthcom-
ing In each of these five divisions.

There are many different concepts
concerning the place and definition of
a recreation program in a hospital, and
the study will give its readers an op-
portunity to evaluate the thinking of
the respondents. The summary and rec-
ommendations made by the committee
give one an excellent incentive to clarify
one’s own analysis of recreation in a
hospital setting. Also, on reading the
analysis of the comments, it is clear
that the need for the recreation profes-

448

sion to gct together and formulate a bas-
ic definition of recreation and its re-
lationship to the rest of the hospital staff
is imperative, before we can expect to
define and discuss our status with the
medical profession—Beatrice H. Hill,
HOSpital Recreation Consultant, NBA.

The Living Wilderness

SUMMER, 1953 ISSUE

The Wilderness Society, Washington

7, D.C. Pp. 30. Published quarterly.
$1.00 per year. Single copies, $.50.

This issue, featuring “Wild Country
As A National Asset,” contains three
Isaac Hillman Lectures delivered at Pa-
cific University by Dr. Olaus J. Murie,
president of the Wilderness Society, in
1953. These lectures are a valuable con-
tribution to the literature dealing with
the preservation of portions of America
in their natural state. It presents effec-
tively the significance and values to our
civilization of maintaining for the use
of future generations primeval forests,
wilderness canoe country, high moun-
tains and wild desert expanses. Dr.
Murie praises the efforts that various
groups have made to assure preserva-
tion of wilderness areas. He describes
experiences in the out-of—doors in sev-
eral countries and recounts what vari-
ous nations are doing to preserve their
lands as a national heritage. Of spe-
cial interest to RECREATION readers is
an account of a visit Dr. Murie and his
wife paid by dog team to a tiny min-
ing community within the Arctic Cir-
cle, and the party that was arranged to
which people came from great distances
to celebrate the presence among them
of the first white woman for many years.

The third lecture, entitled “Beauty and
the Dollar Sign,” cites the monetary
value of the tourist industry. Dr. Murie
recognizes that when tourists flock into
a scenic area it is only natural that cabin
camps should spring up to accommo-
date them and that the grocer and sport-
ing goods store and other appropriate
services should prosper. The dollar sign
is out of place, however, “when it over-
reaches itself and for its own sake
cheapens recreation. . . . It becomes
public enemy number one when in sub-
tle ways it has the effect of lowering the
tone of our aspirations, when through
zeal for gate receipts and the ‘quick
buck’ it degrades our athletics, lowers
the quality of our motion pictures, and
in numerous ways, by assembly-line
technique in inappropriate places, dulls
the sensitivity of the human mind.”

This issue of The Living Wilderness
merits careful reading by all who are
concerned with recreation.

Spiritual Values in Camping

Press, 291 Broadway, New York 7. Pp
240. $3.00.

In these days of anxiety, all leader:
of youth realize more and more the
importance of their developing a scalt
of values that will withstand the bud
geting of a materialistic world, ant
strengthen their moral and spiritua
fibres. Camp is an ideal setting for de
veloping an “awareness,” and this bool
gives many excellent ideas and sugges
tions for making sure that values arl
correlated into every activity, not i]
any priggish way, but as a natural oul
growth of developing friendships, nei
interests, regard for other people’
rights, and so on.

The content of this book is grand. 1
would have a greater impact upon
reader, however, had the paper been c
better quality, and had it been illustrz
ted with sketches which would help wit
the subject matter.

Wrap the big hand around the little hahd . . . for now begins
a little heart’s journey into prayer . . . . the guide is Dad, the goat
is a security not even he can provide.

But the pattern is security, and it is Dad’s privilege to supply
his part of it for the little hearts in his care.
In this binding, enclosing love life finds its finest answer.

The security of our homes is our worthiest goal. And
providing it is a privilege unique in a country like ours, Where
each of us is free to choose his way.

And, think: The security that begins in your home, joined
to that of other homes, builds the strength of America.

Saving for security is easy! Here’s a savings
system that really works—the Payroll Savings
Plan for investing in United States Savings Bonds.

This is all you do. Go to your company’s pay
ofiice, choose the amount you want to save—a
couple of dollars a payday, or as much as you wish.
That money will be set aside for you before you
even draw your pay. And automatically invested
in United States Series “E” Savings Bonds which
are turned over to you.

If you can save only $3.75 a week on the Plan,
in 9 years and 8 months you will have $2,137.30.

U.S. Serics “E” Savings Bonds earn interest
at an average of 3% per year, compounded semi-
annually, when held to maturity! And they can
go on earning intcrest for as long as 19 years and
8 months if you wish, giving you back 80% more
than you put in!

For your sake, and your family’s, too, how about
signing up today?
