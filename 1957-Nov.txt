Recreation in the

Age of Enjoyment . .

OUR ACE BEARS many titles. To \V. H. Auden it is the age
of anxiety. Howard Mumford Jones sees it as the age
of violence ——one dark century of increasing horror. Pro-
fessor Arnold Toynbee classifies it as the age of militarism.
Winston Churchill calls it the age of coexistence—or co-
extinction, as you prefer. Shannon and Weaver recognize
our times as the age of automation rooted in a matured
theory of mathematical communication. To J. Robert 0p-
penheimer we live in the age of the atom. James B. Conant
sees us as standing on the edge of the age of solar energy.
Russell Davenport names our era as the age of fine phrases.

Our age has been variously described as the age of apa-
thy, devoid of burning commitments which once -made life
a crusade; as the age of the neurotic self; as the age of
distraction which gives us fidgety souls; and conversely
as the age of faith with a return to the church. I propose,
however, to discuss our era as the age of enjoyment! In
the closing decades of our century our pace quickens as
we advance toward the fulfillment of the ideals of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, once asserted goals
of the Declaration of Independence.

Ten Professional Problems

The rapid emergence of the age of enjoyment, since the
end of World War II, has brought to focus certain theoreti-
cal, professional and practical problems. Let us briefly dis-
cuss ten of these issues.

Definition of Field. The first relates to a clear definition
of the field of recreation. \Ve need to know what recreation
includes and excludes. It is not a segment of activity at-
tached to physical education. It is not a program for juve-
nile reform. It is not group work. It is not education as
commonly understood. It is not an adjunct of industrial
personnel to keep workers happy at their jobs. It is not
bait to.get men to go to church. Recreation is an inde-
pendent area of life, requiring its own unique disciplines,
and it should be numbered among the professions. The
clear-cut definition of the field which recreation occupies
in life will come about through the active professional par-
ticipation of men and women working in close cooperation
with the universities, especially the graduate divisions. We
need thorough exploration of the meaning of recreation.

Active Professional Awareness. The second problem stems
from the need for active professional awareness. By this

 

DR. DOUGLASS, noted educator, author and government con-
sultant, is chairman of the NRA National Advisory Com-
mittee on the Recruitment, Training, and Placement of
Recreation Personnel. This material is excerpted from a

speech delivered at an L. H. Weir Recreation Banquet at
Indiana University.

I mean working membership in professional societies. The
Southern regional study, Recreation As a Profession in
the Southern Region,* shows that in the upper South about
a half of the recreation personnel belongs to state societies,
a third to the National Recreation Association, a quarter
to the American Recreation Society, and a scattering in
other groups. (It should be clear to all that the National
Recreation Association is a lay organization, the American
Recreation Sbciety, a professional one.)
This membership indicates a far smaller participation
than juke-box operators find necessary to maintain their
interests. The profession needs the active membership sup-
port and society participation of every man and woman
identified with recreation.
Inspired Leadership. leadership too often has been inade-
quately trained or is functioning on minimum standards
which do not utilize the full powers of a really conscientious
worker. The proposal of certification is also a part of this
problem, for legalizing the profession is merely setting an
arbitrary minimum standard and not raising sights to those
real standards written on the human heart.
Status. This problem is closely related to the above. It ex-
ists as a result of the necessity for recognized status of the
profession. Three-fourths of the Southern communities
which employ full-time recreation workers did not have, ac-
cording to the Southern regional study, job descriptions in
writing. We need to concern ourselves with classification,
compensation and security. Side-by-side with the develop-
ment of professional awareness stands the need for a con-
tinuous pressure for clear-cut personnel policies, improve
salary scales and professional assurance of professional sup-
port in maintaining the integrity of work free from politica
interference.
Recruitment. Stable personnel relationships, adequate sal-
aries and good conditions of work will, of themselves, b
insufficient forces to supply the profession with adequately
trained pcrsonncl. The profession has demands for person
nel exceeding any visible supply. The demand to fill va-
cancies in the South exceeds the entire number of recrca-
tion graduates in the United States in any recent year.
The cncouragement of youth to enter the profession t'hu
bccomcs an urgent responsibility of the professional so
cietics, the universities, the field agencies, the communiti
and the National Recreation Association, which is perform
ing its part. The Southern study shows that the curriculum
of Southern institutions are operating far below estimatc ..
student capacity. This means there are idle facilitics at if.
time that there is urgent necd of graduates.
Recreation, Education. Recreation education is oflercd at
over fifty collcges and universities. For the most part the

programs are centered in widely distributed geographical
areas in publicly supported institutions. The pattern how-
ever calls for educational statesmanship to provide standard
undergraduate programs cooperating closely with graduate
institutions. The problem is to see that the nation has
geographically accessible programs in sufficient number to
meet the needs. Likewise, it is desirable to discourage the
development of recreation programs in institutions which
have neither the faculty, facilities, resources or student load
to justify the offering.

One of the chief concerns in the education field lies in

the stimulation of faculty members to professional growth.
The Southern study shows that recreation educators are
giving little time to research and professional writing.
F ieId Work. Every recreation leadership curriculum should
include field experience as an integral part of the total edu-
cation program. No area of recreation activities provides
a better Opportunity for interaction of cooperating agencies
and universities through the catalytic agent of the student.
Field experience is important to the student, to the institu-
tion and to the operating agency. The Sub-Committee on
Undergraduate Education‘” has prepared an important re-
port of student field experience. This sets the standards
of relationship in field work and provides for an evaluation
of the experience program.

Four developments can be helpful to recreation educa-
tion. The first is the relationship of student field experience
to academic education. The agencies have an obligation to
make positions available to students; the institutions have
the obligation to see that student field experience is aca-
demically substantial. On the graduate level, likewise, the
agencies have the obligation to provide internships, as has
been done in several instances. These positions again bring
the university and the agencies into teamwork relationships.
Recreation education needs more and more adequate fellow-
ships at the graduate level. These can come from public
and private sources.

outstanding leadership at the University of Indiana. Pro-

Coordination of Specialization. Already recreation leader-
ship and administration is undergoing functional specializa-
tion. Areas, such as public community recreation, park ad-
ministration, forest administration, hospital recreation,
mental hospital rccreation, voluntary youth servicing agen-
cies, industrial recreation, welfare agency recreation,
church recreation, recreation in penal institutions, tourism
recreation, commercial recreation and private club recrea-
tion are already developing special fields of activity. Es-
pecially in hospital recreation a theoretical foundation and
effective therapeutical experience are being demonstrated.

These various groups tend to have their own specialized
professional associations such as the National Industrial
Recreation Association, the American Institute of Park Ex-
ecutives and the American Camping Association. These are
influential and cooperative groups. We need the teamwork
of all the societies in a common front. Perhaps the Spe-
cialized area of campus recreation deserves mention as a
field of great potential service.

Cooperation of Association. Because the task of meeting
the demands for recreation leadership develops upon the
professional workers, the need for understanding coopera-
tion among the perhaps dozen major professional societies
in recreation and allied fields becomes imperative. The
National Recreation Association offers its services as a
central secretariat.

Further there needs to be a closer relationship and un-
derstanding with the commercial recreation associations
and operating centers. By commercial recreation I refer
to recreation services provided by private enterprise for
profit. To this point there has been little noticeable use
of professionally trained recreation personnel in commer-
cial units. Likewise there has been little demand from the
field for special training for recreation workers for service
in commercial recreation. Nevertheless, city recreation de-
partments are finding areas both of COOperation and com-
petition—and often friction. More interaction with- com-
mercial recreation forces will be beneficial. I

Indian Relationships

Dear Sirs:

I present the attached photograph in
hope you will find it suitable for REC-
REATION. The two people in the photo-
graph are Edwin Jacobs, representing
Utah State Extension Service, and Ja-
son Chapoose, a fourteen-year-old Ute
Indian who lives on a reservation. It
was taken during a recent reservation
recreation leadership session conducted

by Mr. Jacobs and myself.

 

I feel that this photograph tells a
story of significance. It seems to be
the ambition of the white race to edu-
cate and sway Indians to the white
man’s way of life. In spite of millions
of dollars spent by the government and
privatc agencies in an effort to educate
these people in agriculture and tech-
nical fields, limited progress has been
made. Yet this race shows a real inter-
est in white men’s recreation activities.
They seem to be willing and anxious to
learn about the games played by whitc
men and to compete with and against
white men in these gamcs.

I believe that more progress has been
made with the Indians in less time in
the field of recreation than in any othcr
field. People who work with this proud
race are coming to realize that it is
through recreation that working rela-
tionships will improve and progress
will be made in other fields.

The photograph demonstrates a
closer and better working relationship

In Asian Countries

Sirs:

I have seen some issues of RECREA-
TION and I must say that I very much
appreciated the matter I read. In India
and other Asian countries, recreation
is becoming more organized than be-
fore and it is increasingly becoming of
concern to the community. It is my
hope that recreation in Asia will be so
organized as to strengthen family life
and community feelings and not pro-
mote the wrong type of individualism.

I am confident that RECREATION
Magazine will providc me material for
thinking. I am looking forward to the
numbers that will come to me during
the course of the coming year.

We read with keen interest and
great deal of pleasure your June 1957
issue of RECREATION. From our stand-
point it is one of the finest issues w
have seen. It contains a number of ex-

timely. In fact, we regard this issue so
highly that I wrote to Mr. Prendergast
suggesting that state park authoritie
would appreciate having copies made
available to them. _

in the schools and recreation areas in
and around San Diego. It is my belief
if a few teams begin to see the Value of
such an activity for all age groups the
benefits and enjoyment gained would
be everlasting and sought by others, as
well.

I should like to hear from as many
schools and areas as possible where this
game is played or has been played, in
terms of why the game was introduced,
its acceptance or rejection and why, the
number of participants and their atti-
tudes about the game, and any special
rules used other than the official rules
proposed by the Chicago Umpires Pro-

Any information concerning sixteen-

most helpful.

) A TRAVEL STUDY of tourists visiting
Great Smoky Mountains National Park
in 1956, has recently been published in
a beautiful folder. The survey was a
cooperative venture conducted by the
North Carolina State Highway and
Public Works Commission, the Tennes-
see State Department Of Highways and
Public Works, and the United States
Bureau Of Public Roads. Among inter-
esting facts turned up, it was discovered
that more people come to this park each
year than visit Yellowstone, Yosemite,
Glacier, Grand Canyon or any other Of
the national parks.

Maintaining services, year after year
in prOportion to the need, and handling
the problems of such traffic, are not
things that can be left to blind chance.
Therefore, this study was planned to
provide the sort Of information Upon
which sound planning can be based.
Methods employed in making the study
are explained. Further information, or
a free copy of the study, may be ob-
tained from the State Advertising Divi-
sion, Raleigh, North Carolina. Please
mention that you read about this in
RECREATION.

) NEW MAGAZINE! As of January 1,
1958, the National Industrial Recrea-
tion Association will have a magazine
of its own; but its name has not as yet
been announced. We welcome it to the
field Of recreation publications. This,
by the way, will be separate and apart
from the national Industrial Sports and
Recreation magazine.

} THE NEW HIGII SGIIOOL PIIOTO CON-
TEST has just been announced by East-
man Kodak. Sweeping changes have
been made, presenting contestants with
increased Opportunities for recognition.
They will, for instance, compete only
against other students in the same grade,
for state merit certificates; then na-
tional award winners will be chosen
from among certificate holders. Cash
prizes, of $10,400, are double this year.
More than 550 high school students
were recognized last year, with 256 cash
awards. Grand award winners received

$300 each.

) BEFORE A COMMUNITY PLANS A PRO-
GRAM of almost any type for its aged
citizens, it is generally advisable that a
comprehensive and detailed “self evalu-
ation” of local resources be made, ac-
cording to a Survey of Chronic Illness
Needs and Services made in St. Louis
and reported in the July 1957 issue of
the bulletin, Adding Life to Years, pub-
lished by the Institute of Gerontology,
State University Of Iowa. Careful in-
vestigation should reveal not only those
facilities which are available, but also
the degree to which they are currently
meeting the needs of the community’s
aged persons.

) JUNIOR PLAYERS ARE BEING RECOG-
NIZED for the first time next season,
when the United States Table Tennis
Association sends a junior team to the
International Table Tennis Matches in
London, England, March 25 to 29. 1958.
Adult contestants have been sent to
world meets for years, many of them
entered by recreation directors. The
National Junior Team Championships

will be played in Chicago on January
11 and 12, 1958.

) A NATIONWIDE CONTEST to select the
“Outboard Boating Club of the Year”
has been announced by the Outboard
Boating Club of America, national asso-
ciation of boating enthusiasts and man-
ufacturers and sellers of marine equip-
ment. Choice of the Outstanding club.
based on the group’s activities from
May 1 to October 31, will be made by
a panel of editors of some of the na-
tion’s best known boating magazines.
First prize in the competition is an all-
expense-paid trip for two to the 1958
Chicago National Boat Show, including
round trip by air, a three-day stay at
the Congress Hotel, appearance as

guests of honor at ceremonies Opening
the boat show and other festivities. In
addition, the winning club will be
awarded a $500 cash prize. Cash awards
of $300 and $200 will be made to the
second and third place clubs.

Final selection of the “Outboard
Boating Club of the Year” will be an-
nounced prior to the Opening of the ten-
day Chicago National Boat Show on
February 7th. Further information may
be obtained from Outboard Boating

Club of America, 307 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago 1, Illinois.

) KAB IN ACTION: Litter bags are be-

ing passed out to motorists in many
states, as a part of the Keep America
Beautiful Campaign. In New Hamp-
shire, the Automobile Dealers Associa-
tion urges everyone, “Don’t Be a Litter
Bug, Use a Litter Bag.” At the Long
Beach Congress, “Parky Kits” contain-
ing two litter bags which could be hung
on your car doors, were made up espe-
cially for the Long Beach Recreation
Department to give out to delegates.
We used them when driving to San
Francisco, and they were very handy.

Some car manufacturers are also be-
ginning to join this nationwide crusade
to end the litter habit. Publicity in the
Los Angeles Times on Sunday, June 16,
1957, centered around the new litter
bag for Chevrolets. The campaign in
Southern California is also receiving
assistance from the Service Station AS-
sociation, representing two thousand
dealers. General Motors is now a sub-
scribing member of Keep Amcrica
Beautiful, the national organization
created by American business and in-

) lN SPEAKING ON PHYSICAL FITNESS be-
fore the Senate last spring, the Honor-
able Richard L. Neuberger of Oregon
called attention to an article. “Docs
Sports Equal Fitness?” by Mortimer H.
Morris, assistant professor of recrea-
tion at Oregon State College, published
in the New Republic, April 29, 1957.
He recommended that it be printed in
the Congressional Record. Mr. Morris
speaks of our high-pressure sports pro-
motion in America, and points out that
it has not resulted in an athletically
superior country and that, disturbingly
enough, a fitness survey team led by
Dr. Hans Kraus disclosed European
children to be stronger. “Why,” he asks.
“are our sports programs failing to \
produce a physically fit America?” And
he answers his Own question, “Because
hy its very nature a highly competitive
sports program is selective in its choice
of participants. For every boy or girl
who makes the team, there are thirty
or forty who do not. . . .” '

THANKSGIVING PRAYER

OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, we thank Thee for the gift of
rcsponsibility. Give us this day our daily bread of courage and
wisdom, and forgive us our debts of past failures as we forgive those
who have failed us. And lcad us not into the tcmptation of indifference
to the grcat issues and needs of our time. But deliver us from the
evils of doubt and fear and suspicion and all pettiness. Grant that

out of the wide fellowships and noble companionships of our day
may come a deep purpose to go forward as we have never gone for-
ward before. Give us the strength to translate our dreams into the
concrete things that must be done day by day to realize those

dreams. And may the inspiration of great men and women of all
ages be and ever abide with us.

——From Senior Citizen, November 1955.

Do Our Children Read?

Some remarks made by Governor
Frank G. Clement of Tennessee in the
July issue of The Tennessee Conserva-
tionist are right in line with the “Ex-
plore with Books” theme of Children’s
Book Week, November 17 to 24 (see
page 324.)

“We have heard much recently to
the effect that Johnny can’t read,”
writes the governor. “Most critics place
the blame in the laps of our public
school teachers. . . . But the blame, in
my opinion, must be shouldered by the
parents, who should teach him. . . .

“It can be done only through intro-
ducing the child, at the earliest age pos-
sible, to the vast world of good books
that eagerly await his eXploration. . . .

“. . . As with everything else, learn-
ing to read and enjoying this pastime
can only be accomplished by reading.
To encourage the child to read, he must
be offered the best books available in
order to hold his interest.

“Book stores are filled with such
books; school and public libraries are
stacked high with them. Most of the
larger cities now have bookmobiles
which bring the best in reading material
practically to your front door. Too
many of these books, I regret to report.
are gathering dust instead of the finger-
prints of the young.

“Won’t you please see that your child
makes use of these many facilities?”

Do not recreation leaders also have
an opportunity and a responsibility
in this direction?

Jobs for Volunteers

Those who have problems in success-
fully using and keeping volunteers will
be interested in points brought out at
a workshop, “New Horizons for Volun-
teers,” recently held at the National
Social Welfare Assembly. Among them:

The needs of volunteers (and we are
interested in them as persons and con-
stituents of our recreation centers) are
the same for both volunteer and pro-
fessional leaders. They are the need
for——

1. A feeling. of accomplishment and
satisfaction. Give volunteers more work
and responsibility, and promote them to
committee and board membership.
Former staff who volunteer services
make able volunteers.

2. A feeling of being wanted. Small
courtesies give a feeling of welcome.
Interesting jobs or, in the case of menial
tasks, eXplanation of usefulness to pro-
gram can elicit responsible work.

3. A feeling of security. Security
can be strengthened by training and
support of the professional staff.

4. A feeling of recognition. Recogni-
tion can be given by awards, personal
letters of recognition, reports to board,
and by consideration as an individual.

Mrs. Henry M. Dodge, who is chair-
man of the National Social Welfare As-
sembly-United Community Funds and
Councils” Advisory Committee on Citi-
zenship Participation, said that confu-
sion exists among both volunteers and
professionals regarding their respective
job reSponsibilitics. Some jobs are

clearly accepted as responsibilities of
the professional; others of the volun-
teer. There is a middle ground in which
there are no accepted rules, however,
which results in confusion. She urged
professionals to be more imaginative
and creative in thinking of jobs for
volunteers. “Try snmething new,” she
said, “because every volunteer is usc-
ful if there is careful interviewing,
thoughtful placement, and considera-
tion and understanding of individual
capabilities.”

Examples of ways in which imagina-
tion can be used creatively in jobs for
volunteers are: Involve them in organ-
izing new program in suburban areas;
ask volunteers to assist professionals
in office management, as case aides, as
friendly visitors to senior citizens; as-
sign skilled volunteers to interesting
tasks such as volunteer director of
volunteer group.

Mrs. Dodge urged consideration
of aptitudes in assigning volunteers.
“Short-term artists” can do terrific two-
to three-weeks- or month-long jobs,
such as plans for annual meetings.
Long-term planners do a better job on
a task such as organizing a volunteer
program. Think of new ways to use
groups that want to volunteer as a
group. Take them in “teams.” They
can staff hospital desks and similar jobs
on rotation basis.

St0p worrying about “motivation,”
she said. “Remember instead the four
basic needs and keep them in mind
when planning a volunteer program.
The volunteer shares the professional’s
desire to make the world better because
she lives in it, and all volunteers want
to make a contribution as useful citi-
zens.”

Automation

If only a fraction of what technolo-
gists promise for the future is true,
within a very few years automation
can, and should, make possible a four-
day work-week, longer vacation peri-
ods, opportunities for earlier retire-
ment as well as a vast increase in our
material standards of living. . . .

We must do all in our power to make
sure that the potential abundance of
the new technology will be used with
social wisdom to improve standards of
living and welfare, and to provide in-
creased leisure, for all Americans.

If we accept the challenge of the new
technology, if we use foresight and act
wisely and vigorously, we can help to
usher in an age of abundance and free-
dom, the like of which the world has
never known—WALTER P. REUTHER, in
Here We Are, UAW publication, May,
1957. l

An Outsider Looks at

zecwatc'aa

This frank article on important aspects of

our non-work time will stimulate your think-
ing and prove an excellent discussion piece.
Let us know your reaction to it. . . .

Harold W. Williams

TWENTY-FIVE hundred years ago, the Greeks had a word
for leisure. It was schole. It is the root of our own word
for school; that is, a place and a time for learning. Today,
our schools are places of learning, but I am afraid that we
have forgotten that our leisure, in addition to being a time
for sheer fun, ought to be more of a time for learning than
it now is. What is even more regrettable, I fear that many
of our recreation leaders are not so concerned about this end
of the matter as they should be.

The ancient Greeks had a definition for happiness which
went as follows: “The exercise of vital powers along lines
of excellence in a life affording them scope.” It would be
nice if we all had an opportunity to exercise our “vital
powers” along lines of excellence in jobs that give us ample
scope to do so, and some of us are fortunate enough to be
in that position. But I needn’t tell members of the recrea-
tion profession that many people simply do not have jobs
of that type and that even those who have are working only
a small part of the time.

Perhaps there was a time in our civilization when our
work was so consuming of our energies that we needed to
do little else in our free time except to rest or to play. Cer-
tainly no one should quarrel with the idea that leisure is
at least partly a time to relax. We all like to stretch out on
a hammock on a summer afternoon and idly watch the
insects; or to watch a good program on television; to see
a ball game; to play an idle parlor game; to go to a movie.

But leisure, as the derivation from the Greek root for
school suggests, is also a time to learn—a time to cultivate
anduse vital powers. If the leaders of our recreation move-
ment are really concerned about leisure time, then I suggest
that they need to be much more concerned as a group than
they now are about learning and perhaps a little less pre-
occupied with “play for play’s sake.” Otherwise, we might
appropriately continue to call recreation the “play move-
ment” (which it once was), and turn to other leadership to
help us develop the other important "aspects of our non-

nity Services, Department of the Air F orce, Washington, D.C.

work time in this present complex age.

Do we not have a right to expect that our recreation lead-
ers will help us seek happiness in our leisure time along the
lines of that ancient Greek definition? Should there not be
an appraisal of our recreation programs to see if they do in
fact offer us the opportunity to exercise our vital powers?
Should not recreation programs stimulate us to strive for
excellence when we do exercise those powers? Should they
not broaden every avenue along which we might employ the
vital life forces within us?

Do they? To many peOple, recreation leaders seem over-
preoccupied with the frivolous, the trivial, the time-killing
game and the artificial ice-breaker. If the recreation move-
ment is to attain the stature it seeks, it needs noblcr ideals
and more purposeful functions.

Please do not thinkthat it is my purpose in any way to
disparage the philos0phy and fine idealism of the founders
of the recreation movement in America. Their great contri-
butions to human happiness need no defense from me nor
are their rcputations likely to suffer from anything I might
write. But what they preached and taught must be viewed
in the light of what they knew about their world at the time
in which they lived. It was a very different world from the
one we know today, a world which often looked upon play
as sinful, a world in which the masses were devoting all their
time to the struggle to climb out of the slums and tcncments
and into a world of light and air. The doctrine that people
had a right to enjoy life, to play, to have fun, was a radical
doctrine in those days, and we rightly pay homage to the
men and women who had the daring and the nobility to
preach it.

But ours is a very different world. We have material pos-
sessions to an extent undreamed of just a few years ago.
We have evcr-extensivc leisure. More and more of our peo-
ple are educated. We have moved in large numbers from
crowded cities to suburban dcvelopmcnts. Thcrc are more‘,
of us——-more older people, more younger people. There are
more in the middle class. The automobile has made us more
mobilc. Labor-saving devices create even more leisurc for
women and children, as well as men. Our very abundance of
material comforts means that, relatively speaking, we get
less enjoyment from them because they come so easily.\ I

RECREATION

These facts call for new appraisals of the purpose and worth
of recreation, not just a recital of creeds and principles
enunciated years ago to fit an entirely different set of facts.

Perhaps the time has come for recreation leaders to make
up their minds. Are they interested only in organized play
or is their goal more fruitful leisure-time eXperience? There
is a large place for play in the latter, but there is also an
important place for learning.

The life spirit which makes man what he is has its roots
in four quests: the search for truth; the attempt to create,
discover and enjoy beauty; the pursuit of goodness; and
the seeking of fellowship with other men. As we strive to-
ward these goals, we become men more and animals less.
When we neglect them we lose our humanity and our civiliza-
tion begins to merge with the so-called lower forms of life.

In our struggle for material comfort, most of us have to
turn aside from these quests for forty hours a week. We
justify ourselves in the knowledge that, after sleeping for
fifty-six hours, there are seventy-two hours left to us to re-
fresh and enrich our lives and our civilization. We buy
material comforts and leisure time with our work, so that we
may have ample scope to live our lives when we are not
working.

But we, the people, need help. We need leaders who un-
derstand and share these ideals. We need allies. They ought
to be in the recreation movement. At the very least, our rec-
reation leaders shouldn’t put obstacles in our path. We
shouldn’t eXpect to be turned away from the noble to the
frivolous, from the important to the trivial.

Perhaps it will be clearer if we list the vital powers of
man. They fall into three general categories. First, therc
is the power of the mind, the power to think, to reason and
to learn; then there is the power to create and appreciate
beauty; and, finally, there is physical power, the power to
run and jump and throw and lift. Each of these powers can
be turned to the study and search for truth, beauty, good-
ness and fellowship; indeed, each must be turned to these
ends if we are to find real happiness.

How often have we seen recreation leaders subvert these
basic powers in meaningless games or idle hobbies? As a
nation, we look more and more to adult educators, librarians
and ministers to challenge our intellectual powers. The spe-
cialized teacher in music, art or writing inspires our creative
powers. Physical educators lead the way to glorifying our
physical powers. When it comes to recreation, all too often
we get game leaders.

Outmoded ideals add up to one reason why this state of
affairs exists. To much emphasis on training activity lead-
ers and not enough on training philosophers might well be
another reason. I would suspect, too, that preoccUpation
with organized recreation would be another.

As a profession, recreation has struggled up from the play-
grounds, and on the way it has fought educators, park ex-
ecutives and city councils for status—and rightly so. But, in
the process, it has had to lay great emphasis on the impor-
tance of organized activities; so much so that it has sold
itself a bill" of goods to the effect that organization is the
sine qua non of recreation. This just isn’t so. There’s much

NOVEMBER 1957

more to recreation than that. As individuals, all of us know
that a great deal of our leisure time must, and should be,
unorganized.

Our family plays together often, and we like it. We could
do with a few more ideas and a few more facilities; and we
would like to be able to turn to our recreation professional
for help. But, when we do, we find that he is much too busy
organizing groups to give us any advice and stimulation.

What all this adds up to is that many recreation leaders
are missing the boat. As a nation, we deSperately need lead-
ership in helping us to use our leisure time to achieve true
happiness. That leadership ought to come from the recrea-
tion movement, but it is being held back by an outmoded
tradition that recreation consists largely of organized play
activities.

As a starter for correcting this state of affairs, I would
suggest two things, one in the realm of theory and the other
in the realm of practice. I’d like to see some of our recrea-
tion practitioners get together on a realistic and Up-to-date
statement on the aims of the recreation movement. I would
hope to see in such a statement a real appreciation of how
the recreation movement should help us take advantage of
our non-work time in order to promote “the exercise of vital
powers along lines of excellence in a life affording . . . scope.”

It should contain some explanation of the recreation wo’rk-
er in terms of a teacher of leisure-time skills. and a stimui
lator of leisure-time interests. I’d like to see the recreation
movement become the spokesman and guardian of our free-
time opportunities as represented by land and water and by
the conditions of life in the communities in which we live.
Any such statement of principles ought to set out recreation’s
stake in developing the highest level of free-time activities,
unorganized as well as organized.

On the practical side, I would hope to see a recreation
department hire a free-time counselor or coordinator, whose
only duties would be to ride herd on the whole range of
community leisure-timc activities with a goal that envisions
a gradual increase and uplifting in the quality and quan-
tity of free-time programs. My free-time counselor would be
an idea man, a hair-shirt, a philosopher, preacher, a prac-
tical adviser, a man of wide interests—in short, the kind of
person who could get the community excited about free-
time opportunities and then steer individuals and organiza-
tions to the proper places for help. He would be interested
in everything—sports, dining out, automobile travel, do-it-
yourself, gardening, music, art, libraries, discussion groups,
nature, camping, picnicking, backyard fun—everything that
would go to make our way of life a good one.

In fact, if the people in my community (where we have
only a summer playground program) were to ask me how to
establish a real recreation program, I’d tell them to start
with a free-time counselor like the one I’ve just described.
Perhaps he’d be influential enough to raise the quality of
our life, maybe only alittle bit at first and then more, until
finally a visitor from another continent (or another planet)
might come to our community and observe the way we live
and conduct ourselves in our free time and comment: “What
a fine civilization these pe0ple have.” I

Know Your Adolescents . . . carol H. we...

The new Girl Scout survey turns a candid

camera on the teen-aged girl—her

needs, her interests and her dreams.

I DON’T KNOW what’s the matter with my girls,” a leader

of a troop of 13- and 14-year-old Girl Scouts remarked.
“We’ve been together for three years now, and they’ve al-
ways been whizzes at all kinds of crafts and skills and
sports. Now they’ve turned into a bunch of oddballs——-
cliquing off in twos and threes, giggling every time a boy
appears, and wasting the meeting time with chatter and com-
plaints about why we don’t have parties and dances every
Tuesday and Friday and twice on Saturday. I’m afraid the
troop is coming apart at the seams. Even when I suggest
activities that have been favorites for years—like camping——
they look at me as I’d just crawled out of a prehistoric
mound.”

This woman has been a topnotch leader; but she’s being
outflanked by the onset of adolescence. The survey of ado-
lescent girls, conducted for the Girl Scouts by the University
of Michigan Survey Research Center, reveals that around
the age of thirteen or fourteen, girls start shifting gears in
the drive toward adulthood. Up until then, they are con-
cerned primarily with mastering the physical world. Their
interests are centered in the present or immediate future.
They are close to their families, and their friendships are
relatively shallow, easygoing ‘play relationships.

But about the time girls enter high school, their focus
shifts to things social. The most striking change is the ap-
pearance on the horizpn of a new figure—or rather an old
familiar figure in shiny new raiment. The boy becomes a
consideration to be reckoned with. Endlessly. At 14 most
girls start dating. They are vitally concerned about being
popular. When asked what things girls worry about, only a
quarter of those under 14 mentioned popularity with boys.
Among 14- to 16-year-olds, 45% list this as a worry.

Their relation to their girl friends becomes more intense
and emotional. Involved in the search for an identity inde-
pendent of the family, they want a close friend who will above
all be loyal and trustworthy. They need someone in whom
they can confide and who will share their new and complex
problems. These duos can create problems for a leader who
is unaware of their special significance for girls at this age.

As our harried leader found, too, social activities such
as parties and dances shove old favorites aside and move
to stage center. The researchers askcd girls what things a
club should do if someone were to start a new girls’ club.
Thirty per cent of the 12-year-olds suggested outdoor activi-

Surveys and analyses that the National Recreation Asso-
ciation is making constantly at the request of localities which
want to improve their recreation services, reveal rather uni-
formly the lack of recreation programs or opportunities for
participation by girls from eleven to sixteen. The study made

by the Girl Scouts of America points up the same need for
more attention to be given this group. The combined evi-
dence, therefore, clearly indicates that this is an important

service market for the local public recreation department.—

ties such as hikes, but only half as many 14- to 16-year-olds
were interested. Fifty—five per cent of the 12-year-olds sug-
gested social activities; this figure rose to 83% among the
14- to 16-year-old group.

Boys are different; but it complicates life for teen-agers.
Boys don’t start dating as early as girls. They keep up their
interest in sports and games and skill activities long after
girls have shifted to the social arena. When asked to sug-
gest activities for a club, fewer than half as many boys aged
14 to 16 mention social activities as do girls of that age
(33% compared to 83%).

Not that girls drop all their old interests when they pick
up a lipstick. At the l4-to-16 age level, the percentage of
girls who participate in sports, outdoor activities, hobbies,
and creative activities is still high. The percentages inter-
ested in various activities are shown in the sketches at the
bottom of these pages.

Nearly all girls want to get marrried. N inety-two per cent
of them are sure they do, 4 per cent say “maybe” or “don’t
know,” and 4 per cent are against the idea. The nay-
sayers are largely younger girls who haven’t yet ventured
forth on their first date.

Unlike their foremothers in the early part of the century,
girls today see no incompatibility between marriagc and a

leisure activities of 14- ta lb-year-aldsnpercentage at girls participating.

career. Almost all of them eXpect to hold a job, too. And
in adolescence they are more concerned about choosing an
occupation than about getting married. Favorite job choices
are secretary, nurse, and teacher. These are the traditional
jobs for women that are publicized and glamorized in the
mass media. They offer Opportunities to be of service and to
have a certain professional or subprofessional status.

Girls say overwhelmingly that in selecting an occupation
they are not interested in being 'their own bosses, in being
leaders of other people, or even particularly in high pay.
What they are looking for is interesting work,'nice people to
work with (each of these is regarded as an important con-
sideration by over half of all 'girls), steady work, and the
Opportunity to help others. Four out of every live girls
between the ages of 11 and 18 are already doing some kind
of paid work.

About half of all girls, too, receive a weekly allowance
from their parents. More of the under-14’s get an allowance
than do older girls, who presumably are earning enough to
keep themselves in pocket money. But when the older girls
do get money, they rake in sizable amounts. The most fre-
quent amount of allowance for girls under 14 is between
one and two dollars a week. For 14- to 16-year-olds the
average is between two and three dollars a week. 0f the
girls over 16 who get allowances, nearly a third are in the
five-dollars-or-over bracket.

Girls’ responsibility for making their own purchases is
one indication of the freedom that their parents allow them.
There is considerable evidence throughout the study that the
home atmosphere for today’s youngsters is permissive and
cooperative. Girls get along well with their parents and
sharc activities with them. Although most girls wish their
parents were less strict, they accept the need for parental
discipline and generally agree with the specific rules their
parents make for them. Half of all girls have some part in
making the rules at home.

While adolescent girls are tremendously concerned about
themselves—their appearance, their personality, their future
—they also have a strong desire to be of service to others.
The urge to help pe0ple is one of the main considerations in
their choice of a future job. And when asked what things

make them feel important, about half ‘of them mention help-

ing others. But this is not the tray-favor kind of service.
Increasingly, as they grow older, they want their role to be
on an adult level. They like to assume grown-up responsi-
bilities in their after-school jobs, at home, and also at school.

Scouting obviously has a great deal to offer girls at this
age. But from the age of 14 up, only one girl in 35 is a
Girl Scout. Over one-fourth of all girls used to be mem-
bers (Girl Scouts is the organization most widely joined by

younger. girls) but have dropped out of scouting since .the
age of 10.

The reason for giving up scouting is not that girls are less
interested in clubs as they grow older. 0n the contrary,
from the age of 11 to 16 there is a steady rise in the number
of girls belonging to some kind of club. Girls belong to
school activity clubs (54%), church groups (52%), nat-
tional organizations such as Y’s, 4-H, Girl Scouts (45%),
and social groups (9%) . Most of the national organizations,
except for the Y’s (YWCA, YWHA, Hi-Y, and so on) and
Future Homemakers, have a pattern similar to ours in drop-
outs among older girls, but school activity clubs and church
groups increase in popularity at upper age levels.

Three out of four girls belong to some organization (28%
to one group, 22% to two groups, 12% to three groups,
13% to four or more). But what of the girls who haven’t
joined at all? The survey reveals that they are more likely
to come from the poorer homes where the father and par-
ticularly the mother have had less than a high school educa-
tion. N on-members from every background display less self-
conlidence, less verbal skill, less maturity in their plans for
the future, in their relation to adults, in their social skills
and personal resources.

The reasons for not joining a club, at least up through the
age of 16, don’t appear to have much to do with how much
free time a girl has. Members hold jobs outside the home
more often than non-members, they more often date, and
they participate in more leisure activities.

It seems that the very girls who have fewest outlets and
are least mature, the girls who could benefit most from con-

' structive club activities, are the ones who do not oin. How

do we go about reaching them? Have we unwittingly set
up any obstacles that discourage older girls from joining or
re-joining anything? I

Children’s Book Fair

The World Affairs Center, New York
City, in cooperation with the children’s
Book Council, is holding a children’s
book fair during National Book Week,
November 16 to 24.

The fair will exhibit a thousand chil-
dren’s books about other countries,
foreign-born groups in the USA, and

also books about the United Nations
and related organizations. The entire
ground floor of the World Affairs Cen-
ter will be given over to this unique
children’s book fair. Film programs
and talks by authors and illustrators
will be given in the auditorium. The
World Affairs Center is a non-profit or-
ganization serving as a clearing house
and meeting place for all organizations
and individuals interested in world
affairs.

Achievement Awards

Parents Magazine third annual Youth
Group Achievement Awards for com-
munity service in 1956-57 went to 121
young people’s organizations. Among
the winners was the Junior Board of
Directors of the Yavapai County Youth
Center, Prescott, Arizona. After volun-
teering to operate the community swim-
ming pool during the summer of 1956,
sixty-three youngsters organized for-
mally to provide a clubhouse for teens
and have collected $2,000 through the
sale of youth bonds.

Other winners are a youth organiza-
tion in Georgia, which has set up the
first Scout troop in the world for blind
children; a group of ten-year-olds in
Brooklyn, New York, who have “adopt-
ed” as grandparents twenty-two lonely
inmates of a home for the aged; ten
victims of cerebral palsy in California.
who make tray favors for a children's
ward; and a church club which reseed-
ed the Malibu, California, mountain
fire area.

First County Park Ito-Studied

The NRA has just completed a re-
study of a portion of Branch Brook
Park, Essex County, New Jersey, which
was the first county park in the United
States. It was designed by Olmsted
Brothcrs, Brookline, Massachusctts, in
1899. Union County, New Jersey, and
Westchester County, New York, have I
followcd with the development of out-
standing county park systems.

The present Essex County study was
made necessary by the abandoning o”-
the park reservoir as a rescrvoir. The
concept of parks has changed during
the years to include spaces for recrea-
tion; and the purpose of this study is
to make area useable for the enjoyment
of active recreation.

RECREATION

  

 

Nautical Elbow Room

With the phenomenal deve10pment of
pleasure boating has come an anguished
cry for more mooring, berthing and
anchorage facilities. Pleasure boat
skippers look particularly for the pro-
tection and accessibility of a berth along
a finger pier easy to reach by car.*
They also want fresh-water hose con-
nections and a 110-volt electric current
to “spell off” batteries.

New Jersey has embarked on an
ambitious program of deve10ping new
marine playgrounds by dredging mud
Hats and creating new rivers, creeks,
bays and coves. The latest waterway to
be tackled by the state division of con-
servation and economic development is
the Shrewsbury River area which af-
fords boating facilities not only for
residents of New Jersey and New York
but for soldiers stationed at Fort Mon-
mouth and Sea Scout units of the Boy
Scouts, who combine overnight camp-
ing with their seagoing.

The $1,500,000 public marina, dedi-
cated in September at Clam Creek, At-
lantic City, will be, when completed in
1960, the largest, most modern and
complete facility of its type on the 120-
mile New Jersey coast. Financed and
constructed jointly by the state and
Atlantic City—site of next year’s Na-
tional Recreation Congress—the marina
is designed to accommodate visiting
craft en route between New England,
New York, other Jersey harbors and

southern waters.

In addition to an ultra-modern ad-
ministration building which will not be
fully occupied until next Spring, the
yacht basin will eventually boast 370
slips designed to accommodate boats
ranging in length from 30 to 175 feet.

Other facilities being built are elec-
trical and television outlets for each
berth, as well as water, ice and fuel
depots where skippers can replenish
their supplies. When additional funds
are appropriated by the city and the
state, a 1,200-automobile parking lot
and a heliport will be added.

Boat occupants and crews may be

paged twenty-four hours a day through
amplifiers located on the individual

piers. Taxis and rental cars are also
available near the administration build-
ing. The sheltered harbor is accessible
during all weather, the whole year
round. 

The state operates three other mari-
nas which are located at Forked River,

Leonardo and Point Pleasant.-

Junior Museums

 

The Junior Museum in Greensboro, North
Carolina, is a cooperative community af-
fair, started a year ago by the parks and
reereation eommission, recreation depart-
ment and other ageneies. Here museum
director Waller Martinelti holds a work-
shop session for the volunteer personnel.

The growing number of junior muse-
ums across the nation is providing an
absorbing outlet for nature activities
with particular emphasis on “education
through recreation” and on live and out-
door exhibits and programs. A five-
year project by the National Founda-
tion for Junior Museums is providing
California with ten new juniormuseums.
Eight are already in operation (Kings-
burg, Stockton, 'Carmichael, Sacra-
mento, San Jose, San Mateo, San Rafael
and Fresno) ; the Diablo Junior Muse-
um in Walnut Creek will be open on a
daily basis by the end of 1957; and the
tenth project, the Happy Isles Nature
Center in Yosemite National Park, is
under way. ‘

A new two-year project by the foun-
dation is providing junior museums for
Morristown, New Jersey, Greensboro,
North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and
Corpus Christi, Texas.

The junior museum movement is also
receiving much attention in India where
the government is planning a children’s
museum in Delhi. India’s first junior
museum opened in Amreli in 1955.

Ways and Means

+ A North Tonawanda, New York,
bank has made available to the city 495

feet of riverbank land, for the sum of
one dollar.

+ A former Army reception camp in
Orangetown, New York, is being con-
verted into a 2,000-family community,
Shanks Village, by private developers
who have set aside fifty of the project’s
seven hundred acres for two park and
recreation areas, one hundred acres for
five public schools plus additional acre-
age for churches, community buildings
and sh0pping centers.

+ Hoffman and Swinburne Islands in
Lower New York Bay have been pur-
chased from the federal government by
New York City for $10,000, a gift of
Bernard Baruch. The two islands will
be joined by filling in the shallow water
between them and be made into an
ocean park.

+ The Nature Conservancy, a private
organization “dedicated to saving
America’s heritage of wild nature,” re-
cently took title to the Battle Creek
Cypress Swamp in Calvert County,
Maryland. The Conservancy has also
acquired Dome Island in Lake George,

New York.

+ An automobile-free recreation area
is being developed in Stamford, Con-
necticut, as part of its $1,600,000 Cove
Island Park project. The park is divided
into two sections, forty acres on the
mainland and forty acres of island, and
will have two beaches and a modern
marina. A tractor-drawn observation
train of “Minicars” will provide trans-
portation to the island across a main
causeway or bridge. This is a historic

We are familiar with storytelling on the playground——--—L
preparation for which is done, of course, from storybooks:
and, too, there is the magic of reading aloud, which can open'

“The library walls are breaking down and books are over-
flowing not only to community centcrs, playgrounds, subur- _
ban homes, but to the hinterlands as well,” according to the
Christian Science Monitor. “In Massachusetts they are be-
ing stretchcd to include areas as big as one thousand square
miles. Coursing down through birch groves and up rocky
roads, the bookmobile and its children’s specialist reach
into the remotest hamlets. A day spent with her makes one
realize how strong is the thirst for books in these rural
areas.” And books are for recreation as wcll as for learn-
ing; as you know, these two go hand in hand.

Recreation leaders, therefore, carry a responsibility to; I
ward calling the right kinds of books to the attention of chili“

dren—the kind that will stimulatc their imaginations and
help them grow. One way in which leaders can do this is
by cooperating with their local libraries, perhaps in a year-
round series of adventures with books, using Book Week,
or the local book fair, as the springboard for a program

which will promote continued “exploring with books.” \

Cooperative Venture

In Lawrence, Kansas, the traveling library is a coopera-

' | eroy Fox, city librarian. Each was anxious to expand the
xtensive summer reading program sponsored by the library
nd the Lawrence PTA Council. It was felt that both the
reading and the playground program would benefit if a
bookmobile could be obtained. Neither the recreation com-
mission nor the library had the equipment or finances to
carry the project. They, therefore, appealed to the Junior
Chamber of Commerce which responded immediately with
an offer to pay the rental on a trailer. The library construct-
ed shelves in it and set up a checking system. The city
schools assisted in the program by furnishing a librarian
for the wagon. A storyteller was hired by the recreation
commission to accompany the library.

During the summer the recreation commission arranged
for the library to be pulled to each of eight playgrounds and
scheduled either all morning or in the afternoon, with two
half-days for checking and filing. Books were taken out
one week and returned the next. Children could check out
books at either the public library or the book wagon for
credit on the reading program.

   
  
   
 

Through this cooperation of various divisions of public
service, many enjoyable hours were spent by Lawrence boys
and girls who might otherwise have missed an opportunity
to read good books.

EACH YEiItR as I gather the children together in the hush of
candlelight for the library’s Christmas Eve story hour,
there seems to be mingled for a moment with the scent of
pine and fir, the fragrance of clove and cinnamon and warm
yeast rolls rising on the back of the kitchen stove. I can
see again in the bay window the Christmas tree aglow with
candles, tinsel, iridescent birds, and small red cotton Santas,
and I can hear my father reading—“In the time of swords
and periwigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets—
when gentlemen wore ruffles and gold-laced waistcoats of
paduasoy and taffeta—there lived a tailor in Gloucester. . . .”

How I loved as a child the sound of the “stuffs”—the
“satin, pompadour, and lutestring,” the “cherry-coloured
corded silk,” the “gauze and green-worsted chenille!” How
I delighted in the old rhymes heard by Simpkin on Christ-
mas Eve from the garrets, the eaves, and behind the wooded
lattices of the old houses of Gloucester! How I rejoiced in
the goodness of the little mice, the repentance of Simpkin,
and “the luck of the tailor of Gloucester!” Remembering
my own childhood, I could never quite enjoy a Christmas
Eve with children if I did not share with them the beloved
story of Beatrix Potter.

Thus it should always be at Christmas. The beauty of

the season lies not only in its special religious significance
but in the bonds of tradition which draw us together in a
common heritage of fellowship, a heritage as ancient as
man’s first rejoicing in the return of the sun at the time of
the Winter Solstice. When I first began my work in the
library, I was sent to two neighborhoods with mixed reli-
gious backgrounds. Both were served by children’s li-
brarians deeply loved and respected by the whole commu-
nity. At Christmas time, one used in her programs only the
secular material; the other introduced St. Nicholas through
Eleanor Farjeon’s Ten Saints, told the the story of the
Maccabees and had the candles lit at dusk during the eight
days of Hanukkah, and on Christmas Eve read the story of

the Nativity. Each, being true to her own convictions, en-
riched the lives of the children and drew them together in
her own way. This, it seems to me, is a lesson worth learn-
ing and, as I mention the stories which have been used suc-
cessfully in our libraries, let it be borne in mind that they
are no more than suggestions for others who will be read-
ing and telling stories to children during Christmas season,
and that the success with which they are used will always
depend on the story-teller and the mood she creates through
her own heritage.

We begin our season in the library with St. Nicholas Eve
on December 5th and end on Twelfth Night, January 6th.
In our programs we may read or tell old favorites with no
more reason than mine for The Tailor of Gloucester, but
as a rule we plan them on themes which bring out the many
facets of our Christmas heritage. Music and poetry have
their place, and with those who have the time and staff
for it, the puppet show may be the chief event of the sea-
son. We use several editions of The Night Before Christ-
rnas, many of them now out of print but always new and ex-
citing to the children. The favorite is always that illustrated
by Elizabeth MacKinstry with its double-page spreads of the
reindeer dashing over the rooftops and the enchanting toys
in Santa’s bag. Eleanor Farjeon’s Come Christmas, Jean
Thoburn’s Away in a Manger, and Anne T. Eaton’s The
Animals’ Christmas and Welcome Christmas! are favorite
sources for poetry though many other anthologies are
used. The Cherry Tree Carol is lovely to read or sing.

We sing informally with the children, unaccompanied
(unless we are fortunate enough to have someone on the
staff who plays recorder, flute, or guitar) and we use, as a
rule those collections of songs which are also picture books:
the Van Loon and Caslagnelta Christmas Carols, Tertius

Noble and Helen Sewell’s A Round of Carols, The Twelve

Days of Christmas, and so 011.

In our story hour we usually tell our stories, learning
them well to achieve that intimate ease and facility of
tongue so essential in all good storytelling. Some material,
however, should be read. On St. Nicholas Eve, for instance,
we will tell “How the Good Gifts were Used by Two” from
Howard Pyle’s Wonder Clock, but we read “Olaiie’s Dream”
from Knickerbocker’s History of New York and the “St.

CHRIS TM

COMMUNITY
HOLIDAY GIFT

A series of free Christmas lecture-
demonstrations called “Holiday Hints”
was the result of an idea conceived in
one of the regular staff meetings of the
San Mateo, California, Recreation De-
partment. The previous year we had
sponsored a series called “Home Deco-
rations for Christmas,” and the re-
sponse had been overwhelming. Un-
fortunately, we were unable to cope
with the thousands of ideas the group
seemed to want, and attendance
dropped off radically.

We knew, therefore, that public en-
thusiasm for a Christmas-idea session
was very real; and we also knew that
the interest span ranged from holiday
foods to door swags. A group of Christ-
mas lectures, covering as many Christ-
mas subjects as possible, was planned.
We listed all these subjects and consoli-
dated them into the following five
sessions with a specialist scheduled to

talk in each field:

0 Creative Christmas Cards. Block
printing, inner-lube and felt printing.
resist printing, simple silk screen,
wrapping papers.

0 Gift Wrapping. Theme ideas, bows
and ties, decorative wraps, food pack-
ages, parcel posting.

0 Floral Art and Christmas Decor.
Centerpieces, door swags, mantel
pieces, spccial demonstrations.

0 Christmas Ornaments and Crafts.
Tree fantasics, craft ornaments, home
decorations.

0 Creative Holiday Foods and Table
Ideas. Decorating cakes, pies, and
cookies, hors d’oeuvres, children’s food
ideas, food gift ideas.

We offered the series free, our
u ° ° ' ,9
Christmas gift to the community.

The next step was to find people to
do thc lecturing, and this, of course,
was the biggest assignment. We had
set a tentative budget of one hundred
dollars for the lecturers. After talking

r.

with dozens of people, including mem-
bers of our craft classes, instructors,
floral designers, librarians, adult edu-
cation administrators and many others,
we started calling selected people. With-
in two weeks we had our lecturers
signed up, t0pics ironed out and dates
definitely set.

The public library basement was the
best available location. It had a plat-
form that seated approximately one
hundred, so all except the floral art
session were scheduled there. The lat-
ter was held at the shop providing the
lecturer. The program was scheduled!
to start on November 14, the fifth and
final session to be on December 12,I
missing the holiday rush. All sessions
were held in the evening.

Handbills were printed by the offset
method and distributed to organiza

 

lions and individuals expressing an in-
terest in this type of program. Th
library also placed them on the sign-
out desk, and its supply was replenishej
several times. Other publicity appeare
in local and San Francisco newspapers,.
as well as on public information radiq
programs. One of our lecturers was!
scheduled for an interview on the radio,
and she mentioned the series during
her program. A five-foot foil Christ-
mas trec, made by one of the instruc-
tors, was placed in the lobby of the!
library the first week of November, and
served as our “theme tree.” It was.
Hooded with spotlights and attracted :1
great deal of attention.

The attendance at the scssioni
averaged ninety persons. Some of thd
participants attended all the sessionsj
while others came to just the one 0
two of particular interest to thcm. All
those present signed a register and in:
dicated what other types of prograrni
might interest them.

As a department, we were very’
pleased with the reception given our
“Holiday Hints” program, which will
undoubtedly continue and grow in
years to come. Not only did we ac.

CRAFTS FOR CHILDREN

Christmas crafts—or crafts for any
season or holiday, for that matter—get
a head start in Long Beach, California,
through the stimulation provided in
the children’s crafts preparation room.
Located near the main recreation ofiice,
it is easy for the directors 'of the nine-
teen play areas to visit. From the many
craft projects on display, the supplies
and the bulletins available, they take
back all sorts of suggestions for crafts
children enjoy.

At Christmas the room is gaily deco-
rated. Two of the windows are painted
with poster paint to look like stained-
glass windows. Angels and choir girls
are everywhere. Hanging from white
index tabs glued to the plaster ceiling
are all sorts of tree decorations. They
are simple, attractive, and can be made
by children from low-cost materials. A
make-believe fireplace and a small tree
with bright decorations add a tradi-
tional touch.

Right after Christmas all these dis-
appear, and New Year’s decorations,
then those for the February holidays,
Easter, spring, and so on, replace them
—a never-ending treasure trove of
craft projccts for all occasions.

About four years ago, the idea of
letting the children make the decora-
tions for the big, 188-foot Christmas
tree for the City Hall got started. Now
it’s a tradition, and the city fathers
look forward with interest to seeing
what the tree will be like each year. A
white tree has displayed the ornaments
very effectively for the past two years;
this year we may leave it green.

Every municipal play area takes part.
Samples are made in the preparation

room, and each area makes twenty-five
of a selected ornament for the City
Hall tree. A sample and a kit of sup-
plies are given to each area. Actually,
most of the children make three orna-
ments—one for the City Hall tree, one
for the area tree and one to take home
for the family tree. Each area sends
its group of twenty-five ornaments to
the preparation room and receives pub-
lic credit for its ornaments.

Last year foam-rubber ornaments
were featured, so five areas made them.
Other ornaments made were metal-foil
angels, plastic-foam candles, tassels,
paper-cup bells, glitter stems, straw-
drops—to name only a few.

Work starts early in November, with
a deadline of the thirtieth. The tree is
painted and Hameproofed by the main-
tenance crew of the department, which
is responsible for all city trees. The
lights belong to the department. The
tree takes five strings of twenty-five
lights, outdoor type. Staff members
hang the ornaments on the lower limbs,
and two maintenance men do the high
climbing.

Our carpenters made two huge
candles, about five feet tall and eight-
een inches in circumference, painted a
brilliant red, and we put a twelve-inch
neon-tube light in the top of each.
These stand in the hall approaching the
tree. The name of each play area and
a sample of the ornaments made by
each are pinned on these candles. .

Materials used in the ornaments in-
clude metal-foil paper, chenille humps,
pipe cleaners, felt, oilcloth, gummed
crepe paper, plastic-foam balls, sheets
of plastic-foam, colored foam rubber,
paper cups, ice cream cartons, and the
like. The examples that follow are only
a few of the many chosen and made by
the youngsters as a Christmas gift to

the City Hall.

RECREATION

O
Q.

OOKING for ideas for men’s or
boys’ clubs, service clubs, sports
banquets-——-or for a community night
program, indoors or out? The follow-
ing sports quiz, and a new way to put
it on, comes from USAREUR Service
Club Notes.

Decorations. Simple. Use pennants of
all the major league teams. They can
be made of paper, plastic, cloth or felt.
Craft groups will enjoy making them.
Music. If possible, provide a combo
group, fanfares, and snatches of songs

such as “Take Me Out to the Ball
Game.”

Setup. Arrange the stage or open area
as a baseball diamond, using chairs for
first, second and third base, microphone
for homeplate.

Nine chairs on each side represent
the “dugouts”; and seat contestants
when they are in the field. When a team
is up to bat, the first member is asked
a question. If he answers correctly, he
goes to first base. If he fails, he is “out,”
and the second batter comes up. Each
time a batter answers a question cor-
rectly, he goes to first base and any run-
ners on base advance one base. Three
wrong answers bring the other team up
to bat. Each batter has his choice of a
“single,” “double,” or “home run” hit,
depending on the degree of difficulty of
the questions.

Make up your own questions, draw-
ing upon your knowledge, your sports
library, other publications and sports
experts, being careful to include some
questions that are fairly easy as well as
some more diflicult. Everyone should
have a chance at an easy one now and
then to keep him from becoming dis-
couraged; but he should have to think
too! Don’t make your quiz so long that
participants have archance to become
bored. Fifteen questions in each cate-
gory would be about right.

The following are examples of ques-
tions that might be asked in each of the
categories:

Recreation
Perspectives

Historical Goals

The development of recreation has been based on the
ideal that all who desire recreation activities in the open
air should be able to find adequate public open space for
thcir enjoyment. We have attributed to recreation, quali-
ties which improve physical and mental health and moral
values. We have attempted to pcrpetuate, although in a
reduced form, the open-space tradition inherited from our
past, for the enjoyment of the out-of-doors, and for educa-

tion in nature lore.

Growth Factors

Today, in metropolitan areas throughout the United
States, recreation development is faced with several im-
portant happenings:

1. Our population is growing. In order to maintain
today’s ratio of recreation lands to people, large acreages
will have to be acquired for the future.

2. Our economy is expanding and incomes are rising.
More of our people who desire elaborate and land-using
recreation activities are obtaining the financial means with
which to realize them.

3. People are more mobile. They are able to get into
the family car and travel to more distant open spaces
quicker and with greater frequency than ever before.

4. We are using up raw land at a greater rate than in
the past. More land is required for residences; our high-
ways are wider; suburban shopping centers are built on
four to five times as much land as is required for a store’s
floor area; industry is acquiring four to eight times as
much land per manufacturing unit as it did previously;
the competition for all types of land is increasing every
day.

In the face of all this, it’s going to be increasingly hard
to obtain adequate recreation lands in the future. Yet,
spaciousness is one of the characteristics people seek in
recreation areas.

MR. CARPENTER is executive director of the Tri-County Re-
gional'Planning Commission of Medina, Summit and Port-
age Counties, Ohio. He was formerly head planner of the
Detroit Metropolitan Area Regional Planning Commission.

Automation

Automation is one of the most important factors in the
recreation picture: the shortening work week and the effect
of automation on the leisure time of our people. We have
gone through one industrial revolution in this country, in
which the muscles of men were rcplaced by machines and
men were retained as operators. An increase in leisure
time resulted under these conditions and recreation as an
important factor in our lives developed to its present pro-
portions.

\Ve are now at the beginning of a second industrial revo-
lution. Through automation, men as operators of machines
are being replaced by machines, and another' increase in
leisure time is coming. The effect on the further deve10p-
ment of recreation is incalculable at this time without addi-
tional research, the development of new research concepts
and continuous intensive study.

Background for Recreation

This then is the background from which we look at our
regional recreation picture: a growing population; an ex-
panding and rising personal income; people more mobile
than ever; greater competition for land for all purposes;
an increase in leisure time, and time available for recrea-
tion that is beyond reasonable prediction at the present.

Concern of Regional Planning

Because of its land-use implications, all metropolitan or
regional planning commissions should be concerned with
recreation. Their concern is for the over-all perspective,
for the relation of recreation to other land uses and to
transportation, utilities and services. Our concern, on a
metropolitan scale, is with recreation land—quantitatively,
qualitatively and location wise-——to make sure that enough
land is provided to accommodate in the future the recrea-
tion activities of the people who will be living in those
regions.

The major interest is in large recreation areas developed
for extensive type activities, such as camping, boating, fish-
ing, swimming, winter sports and picnicking. These are
differentiated from intensive local recreation uses char-

acterized by the playground and playfield. arm—>-

Recreation Standards

The weakness of the approach to determining future rec-
reation requirements by most agencies becomes apparent
upon examination of the basis on which they determine
their land requirements. These reveal a variety of atti-
tudes, such as:

o Accepting the limitation of the lands now owned and
making the most of them.

0 Acquiring lands that have some features to recommend

them for recreation use, wherever they may be, and de-
veloping them.

0 Conserving flood plains and providing parkways.

0 Repeating, in some cases with minor variations, the

thirty-four-year-old standards of the National Recreation
Association.

0 Providing playgrounds and playfields to complement the
public school system.

0 Providing a park or two.

0 Stating that more lands are needed, but without further
specification or precision.

In practically no instance is there a relation between
lands to be acquired and a determination of the need for
recreation activities to be accommodated. There is not in
existence today a body of information that can indicate
what the desires of people are for recreation of various
kinds. The consideration of the growth factors and auto-
mation, listed earlier, have not been applied. The commu-
nity or area goals (what are we trying to accomplish) have
not been defined with respect to recreation. Recreation
programing and land acquisition appear to be pretty much
a matter of responding to pressures exerted by various in-
terest groups for projects they are sponsoring.

Recreation desires of the present population must be de-
termined and projected on some logical basis for the future.
A great deal of original research needs to be done on the
subject of the future trend of leisure time activities in the

highly industrialized regions. Principles, goals and stand-
ards must be established explicitly for a determination of
future recreation land needs, to serve as a basis for a plan,
and as a basis for the future spending of public funds.

A rule of thumb for allocating recreation lands has been
in use since 1923, promoted by the National Recreation
Association, and with some variations is used throughout
the country today. It states that ten acres of park and rec-
reation land should be set aside within the city for each one
thousand of the popuation. For metropolitan regions an
additional ten acres of park and recreation land should be

allowed for each one thousand of the total population of
the region.

The Magnitude of the Problem

There is great danger in the use of any national stand-
ards. They are intended only as general guides. They give
no assurance that a community will achieve the kind of rec-
reation development required to meet its situation. At best,
they can only indicate, in “round numbers,” the magnitude
of the problems confronted.

Writh our present expanding recreation picture, there is
a growing need that the thirty-four-year-old general stand-
ards of the NRA should be revised, consistent with recrea-
tion requirements of a future way of life that is rapidly
overtaking us. The question is how and on what basis?

It would seem most logical that the people best qualified
to undertake this work would be the National Recreation
Association. Recreation needs a new and expanded philos-
ophy. Principles and goals should be re-defined, to serve as
a basis for standards and a determination of land require-
ments on a metr0politan basis.

If it is not logical or feasible for the NRA to do the job,
then it is hoped that in our metropolitan area proper inter-
county recreation organizations can make these determina-
tions adequately. In this instance the following recom-
mendations would be appropriate:

1. The scope of the investigation and planning should
be sufliciently extensive to cover the recreation require-
ments of the people living in a metropolitan area projected
over a long period into the future. In most cases the area
under consideration should encompass a major portion of
the state.

2. Acceptable principles of public recreation and dc-
sirable standards for recreation land and capital require-
ments should he developed for the entire area.

3. A statement of recreation needs should he prepared
based upon the desires and requirements of the people in
the area.

4. A general land plan of public parks and recreation

facilities should he prepared. I.
5. Concerted steps should be taken to coordinate recrea-

tion planning and area development among the state, metro-
politan park and recreation authorities, the counties, and
the municipalities.

6. An organizational structure best adapted to the needs

of contemporary and future recreation programs and lands
should he provided. I

NOTE

The Changing County

In view of the growing interest in the possible organiza-
tion of recreation services on a county basis, the following
pros and cons of the county as a unit of government merit
attention. They appeared in a report, The Government of
Milwaukee County, prepared by the Public Administration
Service.

Among major objections to counties as units of govern-
ment:

0 Most county boundaries were laid out one hundred or
more years ago.

0 Counties have been unable to attract superior personnel
to their service and usually have limited financial recources.
0 Many county functions serve only the residents of unin.
corporated areas but county taxes are paid by all residents.
0 County organization is ill-adapted to sound public man-
agement.

o The county is often a unit for representation in the state
legislature.

0 County boundaries have impeded the orderly develop-
ment of metr0politan government.

On the other hand, counties are likely to persist in the
future because they have the following virtues commonly
possessed by no other unit of government.

0 A sizable fraction of the American public knows only the
county as a unit of local government.

0 Most states are too large in area and too varied in popuv
lation to render their services centrally.

o It is desirable that the decentralization of state govern-
ment should be combined with the administration of local
government at some level.

0 The alternatives to county government are by no means
appealing—From National Municipal Review, October

1956.

Report Writing

Many practical suggestions for effective report writing
originated in a recent three-day session for professional
engineers sponsored by the University of Wisconsin. Some

approaches, to report writing that can improve the caliber
of communication are:
1. Write in the same manner as you talk.
2. Organize the report before writing.
3. Use charts or graphs to dramatize your information.
Ideas proposed for helping the report to “talk” are:
1. Use the personal pronoun “I” in place of the vague

“we” or impersonal “it.”

NOVEMBER 1957

\

2. Replace deadening past tense verbs with the present
tense.
3. Use words that are simple, clear; also short sentences.

Lack of organization is the most common fault in report
writing.

Practical ideas presented are:

1. Report Title: A title’s job is to tell all by itself what
the report contains. Write in one sentence the purpose of
the report, using as many words as necessary. Then prune
words, and compress the title.

2. Table of Contents: Always include a listing of the
report’s contents to enable the reader to locate immediately
the section that interests him.

3. Introduction: The introduction section often is no,
more than a letter of transmittal to the mayor and city
council or city manager. If the introduction is more ex-
tensive, the writer should offer the reader a crisp statement
of the purpose of the report.

4. Conclusions: This is your “show window.” The news-
paperman might call this section the “lead” of your story.

5. Developing Section: You’ve introduced the reader to
the report, set out your conclusions, and now you’ve got to
back them up. This is the purpose of the deve10ping section.

6. Summary: A summary is more a formality than a
necessity. If you have clearly stated your conclusions, and
the development section is concise, then a summary is only
a rehash at best. If a summary is required, however, then
briefly restate the problem, results, and procedure.

7. Appendices: This is the catch-all for calculations,
historical data, and other material of a supporting nature.
Such information should be included in a report to back
up your conclusions, but place it in this “bin” to avoid
cluttering up the body of your report.

Ideas for pictorial statistics are:

1. The symbol should be related in meaning to the
statistic; for example, use garbage cans to indicate in-
creases in the workload of the garbage trucks.

2. Symbols on the chart should represent a definite unit
of value.

3. The number of ideas presented in a chart should not
exceed two or three at the most. A complex chart defeats
its reason for existence.

Guides that serve as a final check: Is the problem well
stated? Are conclusions stated clearly? Are conclusions
well-supported? Are technical terms understandable? Is
the organization compact?-——From “Effective Reporting
Can Help City Government” by Richard A. Carver. The
American City, June 1957.

Refreshment Stand in Park

Right of park commissioners to main-
tain refreshment stand in public park
situated in residence zone upheld by
Court which said that such stand was
not a nuisance but was a necessary part
of a public facility, a proper accessory
use serving the public, and had caused
no destruction of neighboring property
values. Board of Park Commissioners
versus City of Bay Village, 141 N .E.2d
769. (Court of Appeals, Cuyalioga
County, Ohio, Apr. 24, 1957.)

Beach Right

In this case a special Act of the State
Legislature authorized the Township
of Huntington to establish and main-
tain public beaches on any point within
the Town, regardless of conflicting rcgo
ulations established by any incorpo-
rated Villages within the Town. This
Act was challenged by two Villagcs and
by taxpayers living there.

In the opinion, the Court held that
the special law destroyed the uniform-
ity required Under the Constitution, and
so was invalid. It was also pointed out
that, with the establishment of a beach,
the result might be to create hcavy traf-
fic congestion and policing hazards. In-

The Craziest Halloween, Ursula von

Although it is past time for review-
ing a Halloween story, we must men-

she is old enough to ride a broom.
Weeny was four hundred years old but
had another hundred to go. Clever

Games to Build*

Boys Clubs of America, 381 Fourth
Avenue, New York 16, New York, Pp.
96. Paper $2.00.

This spiral-bound booklet solves the
problem of how to provide simple,
sturdy games for gameroom programs
and, at the same time, offers the craft or
woodworking department an oppor-
tunity to make excellent, useful projects.
It gives simple, clear directions for
making a number of board games.
box games, floor and wall games, game
tables and puzzles. Directions for each
include information as to age-group,
cost, time to make, materials needed,
instructions for making and for play-
ing. Construction plans are clear, and
a sketch shows the finished project.

The book does not quarrel with com-
mercial games; there are many fine
ones. Unfortunately, many commercial
games are designed more for home use
than for the rigorous wear and tear

they get in a community center or club
gameroom. Also budgets often do not
permit the purchase or the replacement
of many games and gameboards. Here,
this book will be valuable in increasing
the variety of games on hand, and, at

How to Make a Miniature Zoo*
(Revised edition)

Vinson Brown. Little, Brown 8. COm-

pany, 34 Beacon Street, Boston 6. Pp.
212. $2.75.

Anyone who has read the author’s
two books, Amateur Naturalist’s Hand-
book, and How to Make a Home Nature
Museum, will want to add this to the
collection. It should be very useful to
camp counselors who wish not only to
encourage the study of wild life but also
to protect it. Playground or club lead-
ers and parents of boys and girls at the
collecting age will find themselves using
it frequently.

We might add that an excellent fea-
ture of this book is the fact that it does
not deal exclusively with Eastern wild-
life. Mr. Vinson is a native of the West
Coast: therefore he includes species of
wildlife native to the West, as well as
the East.

The information 011 how to house,
feed, care for and observe insects. spi-
ders, fish, frogs, reptiles, mice, birds
and the like is presented accurately and
sympathetically.
