editorial

RECREATION has been the magazine

of the recreation movement

since 1907. It has an unbroken rec-
ord of more than forty-three years of
service because it has adapted and ad-
justed itself to changing conditions
and changing times along the way. It
first appeared in April 1907 under the
title of The Playground. This first
number carried an emphasis on play
leaders and the help which colleges
could give in training such leaders.
The issue consisted of sixteen pages.
In 1931 the title was changed to
RECREATION, which has been continued
ever since. Since October 1947 there
has been a continuous effort to im-
prove the magazine in all its aspects.
We believe that the time has now come
for another major readjustment so that
RECREATION may continue to grow and
to be the finest magazine possible and

of the greatest service possible to the
recreation movement.

In my April editorial, I stated that
“We are reviewing the place which the
association should have in the over-all
recreation movement. We are testing
the necessity and efficiency of our
many services. We are seeking new
ways to be of service. We are now
subjecting our publications, and
among them RECREATION, to a care-
ful study.”

I also added, “We believe that
RECREATION magazine should play an
important part in bringing us all to-
gether to share experiences, to impart
inspiration, to keep us ahead of new
deve10pments in the field of recreation.
We want the magazine to mean more
to you than perhaps it has in the past,
to be the kind of magazine that you
want to receive, one that will bring
you needed inspiration, suggestions to

1:0-

REUREA’I‘IUN

magazine looks ahead

help you do your recreation job.”

It seems to us, for instance, that a
great deal more attention should be
given to the many major problems
which every recreation executive must
face from day to day—problems of
administration, office management, per-
sonnel and financing; problems of pub-
lic interpretations and community re-
lations; problems of procuring; de-
veloping and maintaining areas, facili-
ties, buildings and equipment.

We believe that more attention
should be given to actual recreation
programs and activities so that recrea-
tion leaders may be helped in organiz-
ing and conducting special activity
programs in arts and crafts, sports and
athletics, drama, music, nature study
and in all the other phases of broad,
year-round recreation programs. We
believe that activities material should
also be included on individual, family
and other informal and formal group
recreation.

We also believe that the philosophy
and history of the recreation movement
should not be overlooked, and that the
magazine should carry editorials and
special articles setting forth the basic
values, fundamental principles and the

theory of recreation from many points
of View.

You will note that the size of the
magazine has been slightly increased to
bring it to the standard eight-and-one-
half-by-eleven-and-one-half-inch size.
This will permit us to use either two
or three columns on a page, thus giv-
ing us more space for articles and pic-
tures and more variety to our page
format. The number of pages is being
increased and will be increased even
more in the future to provide more

space for new departments and special

features on such subjects as parks an
recreation, schools and recreation,
cial agencies and recreation, hospit
recreation, industrial recreation, stat
and federal recreation, recreation train
ing, professional societies and associa
tions, as well as reports on new prod
ucts and equipment, a forum for th
exchange of practical suggestions an
tips on trends in the field of recreation
New regular features will be added
for example, “Personnel” and “What’
New” appearing in this issue.

We are also instituting two definit
departments at this time, under th
headings of “AdministratiOn” an

tion, ideas and answers to your ques-
tions and problems—in these two area
of concern. We are hoping that the
“Recreation Comments” section (page
415) increasingly will carry your own
opinions of specific subjects presented
in various issues Of the magazine, so
that this page may become an exchange
of views and experiences—such as
might take place in an informal discus-
sion when recreation leaders meet.
Just what the magazine will contain
in the future will depend, however, up-
on what you, the readers, really want.
We will always be glad to receive sug-
gestions on how RECREATION can be of
greater service to you. We hope to
make it the one magazine that no rec-
reation leader can do without; the mag-
azine that will be of the greatest possi-
ble help to all recreation workers every-
where; and the magazine that does the
best job of interpreting to the public

First issue appeared in 1907
under title of The Playground.

ll‘he first issue of the magazine measured five-
and-one-fourth inches by eight-and-one-half
linches, consisted of sixteen pages, and sold for
one dollar per year. The two typical illustrations
from those early days, reproduced here, show
that community centers offered club rooms for
meetings, such as that of the Girl Scout leaders,
above, right; and see-saws were favorites on the
first playgrounds. Changes in the magazine have
been the result of steady growth, according to
new needs and concerns during changing times.

“Whither ‘Western’ Square Dance?”

Department of Recreation
Seguin, Texas
Sirs:

In regard to the article, “Whither
‘Western’ Square Dance?” in the No-
vember issue of RECREATION, I would
agree heartily with the author.

In this area, at the present time, we
are being plagued by this “new dance-
itis.” The more experienced callers, a
very small percentage, seem to realize
where this is leading us. However, they
are helpless owing to the fact that so
many newer, beginning callers feel that
they must call an absolutely new figure
and try to outwit the dancers in order
to become popular. A few of the new
dances are reasonably good, but the
majority are awkward, basically uu-
sound and definitely not folklore. Texas,

‘for example, has a rich heritage in

square dancing, and yet many of the
good old-time figures have been virtu-
ally unexplored.

I am wondering if any area has had
this particular problem and has found
a way to combat it successfully. If so,
I would be delighted to hear from it,
as I can see no solution to controlling
the influx of new dances.

GEORGE LOWREY, JR.
Supt. of Recreation

Fairless, Vermont
Sirs:

“The Recreation Leader” says a lot
of good things that need to be said;
let’s hope that others will say more to
drive the points home. The westerns
have made hardly a dent on the con-
sciousness of Green Mountain folk—a
little in the way of hearsay, of course—
yet the idea expressed by the author, of
keeping square dancing simple, free

from complications and within the nat-
ural expression of most folks, is a good
one to stress in the Maple Sugar Belt.
If I were to pick quotations to put into
a nutshell I think I’d choose: “ . . . It
is good neighbor recreation; its main
goal is fellowship—cooperative, not
competitive.”
HERBERT E. WARREN

Sirs:

I give thanks that such an article
should be published in RECREATION.

Congratulations. It calls a spade a
spade with very few exceptions. It gives
the thought of so very many whose
voices cannot be heard. It strikes at the
very root of the “evil” days square
dancing has come upon. It is truth un-
varnished.

There will he cries of wrath from
quite a number who feel that square
dancing is THEIRS and THEIRS alone to
do with as they please. The extrovert
followers of the guilty will also rise to
hurl defiance at “that person” who
seeks to speak aloud at what their
“grrrrrrr-eat” callers have done to cre-
ate a “NEW” way of life.

I am happy that the writer has joined
in the fight against the few taking over.
Real dancers and callers will applaud
the article and pray that it will be
heeded.

Square dancing is the people’s dance.
Let those who value recreation keep it

that way.

Sirs:
It surprises me how completely the

author assumes that city people are not
folks, perhaps not even human. They
are folks, however, real folks, with
perhaps more hunger and more need
for the joyous and the good than those
smaller groups outside the city who
don’t have to live the daily strains and
distractions of a pavement civilization.

One of the most interesting and en-
couraging phenomena of the last dec-
ade has been the way the city folk have
turned to the joy of the American
square dance. One of the chief glories
of the western dance has been its far-
flung urbanization. And from the city,
reinvigorated, it is sweeping gloriously
back to all the country again.

Your author seems to condemn this,
to deplore the fact that the city people
should share in this rich American her-
itage. And he then paints a picture
that I simply cannot recognize—of in-
sane people rushing madly through
dances that they cannot understand,
dressing in absurd and outlandish cos-
tumes, kow-towing to the country clubs,
eagerly developing social snobbishness,
and feverishly living in a state of con-
tinual competition.

I have visited hundreds of western
dances and I have never seen the hectic
insanity your author so unfairly de-
scribes. To be sure, folks are folks.
And in any group of folks there are
bound to be a few fools, a few extrem-
ists, whether you are in the city or in
the country, in the East or in the West.
But they are rare. I have been at coun-
try dances so clannish, so su5picious
that a stranger felt completely unwanted
there. And I have been at other coun-
try dances where they made me feel
like a king or something very special.
I also have met a few unsociable snobs
in the city dances, but precious few at
that. I have known a few country club
groups and have been impressed in
every instance by their genuine de-
mocracy, not caring that I was a mere
school teacher, inviting young people
who had neither money nor social posi-
tion, but who could dance.

Your author’s tirade against “gin-
gerbread” and the “rococo” sounds like
a leaf stolen from my own notebook.
We all strive earnestly to keep things
beautiful and simple, and we all have
to correct the enthusiast who goes to
extremes. But most of us refrain from
condemning a whole beautiful move-
ment because we saw one little “silly”
whirling too fast for her corner to
meet, or because we have seen one New
England couple swing until they stag-

gered on the floor.

I don’t know more than one or two
western leaders who are not completely
opposed to “competition” and who are
not trying to keep our dancing free
from this deep-seated tendency of all
Americans. They want none of it in our
program of the dance.

I also talked with an old-time coun-
try musician last month. He, too, was
distressed that people no longer wanted
him to play on his squeaky little con-
certina. The dear little fellow simp‘y
cannot make music good enough for a
dance. That is his whole case. They ac-
cepted him, he says, when the stand-
ards must have been very low indeed.
I have talked to hundreds of other
country people who have thanked us
for giving them back their reinvigor-
ated dance on a plane a little higher
and more joyous than that represented
by the kindly, but incompetent, con-
certina player.

I cannot help wondering if your an-
thor may not be somewhat in the same
position. A little overwhelmed by the
glorious and joyous development of
this rebirth of the dance, beached per-
haps in some small backwash of less
appealing dancing, may he be munch-
ing at a few sour grapes and content-
ing himself by damning that which he
no longer controls?

If he were completely honest and rea-
sonably brave, he would have signed
his name. But he has chosen the ques-
tionable cloak of anonymity, which no
real man can respect, and has painted
a picture which no well-informed man
will believe.

To be sure there may have been a
few too many new dances lately, but
we are correcting that. A few extrem-
ists may have shown a sudden burst of
speed, but we are calming them down.
I am sure that I have had to spank
gently more excessive twirlers than has
your author. But what a fine dog the
pup that chases his tail can grow to be.
Let’s have a little faith. Any new social
movement will be troubled by the over-
enthusiasm of the young in heart and
by the excesses of a few zealots.

-But when we look at the whole pic-
ture and see the joy that is spreading
from coast to coast, we have no room
for provincialism and we have no pa-
tience with the critic who can’t bear to
see so many peOple having such a won-
derful and joyous good time together.

Think of the fellowship, the friendly
handclasps, the true democracy of a
great group of people meeting on the

416

common plane of having healthy fun
together! Costuming, yes, because the
costumes are so much easier to dance
in (and I wish I had time to prove
that; it is so easy to prove) ; they flash
a bit of color as a gay relief from the
drab costumes of the business day.

I still remember the thrill of seeing
over fifteen thousand people dancing
to a .single voice out at Santa Monica
last summer, in what the police depart-
ment described as the best-behaved
crowd it had ever seen. I saw no frantic
rats befuddled in a maze. Thirty-eight
different callers, thirty-eight different
dances, and everyone dancing with ease,
confidence and joy in that great mass
get-together. _

I remember what this western dance
has done for individuals I know, for
families, groups and communities that
I know. This great, simple, restorative.
joyous movement has nothing to do
with your myopic author and is sweep-
ing on as one of the sanest and most
hopeful influences in this hectic and
fear-shadowed age.

Sirs:

I saw the western type of square
dancing in Boston two years ago. It
impressed me very much at that time
with its exhibition possibilities.

I learned to square dance on the
prairies of Saskatchewan in the twen-
ties, but our square dances were com-
paratively simple and lacked all the

Hourish that the modern westerns em-
phasize.

As a hobby, I have been conducting
square dances for the past fifteen years.
As a result, a great many people who
attended these classes have not only
learned to dance, but have become ex-
pert callers. One of our alumni, Hart
M. Devenney, has a Trans-Canada
square dance program, broadcasting
square dances from Winnipeg each Sat-
urday night. I have just received a let-
ter from him this morning from which
I quote in part :,

“My wife and I belong to a club in
Winnipeg which boasts about a hun-

twelve large clubs in this city as well
as numerous smaller ones. I trust that

Sirs:

Is the square dance a folk dance 0
a character dance of the people of th I
United States?

Folk dances may be defined as th
traditional dances of a country whic
have grown naturally and sponta
neously from the everyday activitie
and experiences of the people. The
are handed down from generation t
generation and are more or less fixe
in their basic patterns. These basi
patterns may vary in sections of th
country just as a basic language re
veals different colloquialisms, dialect
or changes. The significant fact is tha
there is no conscious effort to intro
duce changes or variations. They com
about through repetition in the hand- 
ing-down process.

Character dances are not traditiona
in nature. They are created by indi-
viduals through fitting characteristic j'
steps and designs to folk and other "
melodies. If or when they are handed 1_
down, they are added to, or altered.

Many square dance enthusiasts——
such as Lloyd Shaw, Herb Greggerson,
the author of “Whither ‘Western’ Square
Dance?” and others—apparently con-
sider the square dance a folk dance.
Such persons have gone to much trou-
ble to discover, record and teach the
dances which have been handed down'
in various localities. If the above defi-
nitions are to be accepted, certainly the
square dance is a folk dance. If we
wish to develop character dances from
our folk dances, then we must continue
in the performance of fantastic forms
and “gingerbread” calls.

‘ Surely the true love, freedom and
spontaneity of dancing can be found
in square dancing as folk dancing.
The United States, with its background
Of nationalities, has little to pass on
in folk dancing which is traditionally
American. Let that little be recognized I
in American culture in its own right!

NOW ARE WE fallen into the season
when four million Americans
can the leaden skies h0pefully, hang
on the radio’s meteorological reports
and pray for bad weather. They are the
“ski burns,” a race of week-end hill-
billies with wings on their feet and
rocks in their heads.
. Ever since the first ski tow appeared
in the United States in 1933, the sport
has been gradually increasing in popu-
larity, at least among the juvenile and
collegiate delinquents. Now, what with
continued prosperity, the spreading
custom of the winter vacation and the
*widening appeal of the athletic life
generally, the ranks of the slat-happy
are multiplying almost as alarmingly as
shmoos. If one pollster’s guess is as
good as another’s, the number of skiers
in the United States has doubled since
prewar days.

probably the dullest spectator sport in

the world. The only way you can en-
joy it is to strap on the slithering slats
yourself. The kanonen (expert skiers)
say that only those who ski ever learn
what the fanatics rave about.

The others—merely ninety-seven per
cent of the population—get their ideas
of skiing mostly from travel folders
and the movies. These hear about as
much resemblance to the common,
week-end skiing that is done in this
part of the world as St. Moritz does to
Bear Mountain.

It is time that something were done
to correct the widespread misconcep-
tions, as well as to guide generations of
snowbunnies yet unborn. So here is a
helpful sermon on the truth about ski-
ing, presented, as radio announcers
say, as a public service.

To dispel the common errors in
order of commonness:

The “Freezing” Error

When skiing, you are more likely to
suffer from overheating than freezing.

Ira Henry Freeman

Certainly you will not feel the cold
nearly so keenly as in New York most
of the winter. The reason is mainly
long underwear.

In town, a smart girl wears flimsy
whimsies and piles on a woolen or fur
coat when venturing outdoors. 0n the
ski hill, she puts the blanket next to
her body in the form of knitted “long
johns” and wears the thin stqu outside
as a Windbreaker. It makes all the dif-
ference as to comfort (and as to
glamor, also, unfortunately).

Another reason why you won’t freeze
while skiing is the climate. In New
York, wet gales whistle through dark,
slushy streets in winter. But high in
the mountains, the sunshine pours down
unimpeded, even by clouds, and is re-
flected back at you from the counter-
pane of snow everywhere; and the air
is as dry as triple sec champagne. That
is why you must guard against serious
sunburn while skiing the Alps or Sier-
ras, and that is why you can enjoy an
after-skiing dip in the outdoor swim—
ming pool at Sun Valley in February.
In March, the weather gets so warm,

times more “schussing” per day if you
ride up the mountain mechanically than
if you climb up by muscle-power.
Therefore, resorts are equipped with

much snow. Only a handful of skiers
in this part of the country have the
experience to manage their runners in
deep, fresh powder. Hence, you will
see slopes rutted by traffic to the bare
soil, while right alongside is another
hill with its virginal snow still un-
trackcd. The herd is waiting for the
ski patrol to “break out” the new slope
by tramping down the thick. fluffy cover
with snowshoes and skis.

The weather is so variable that some-
times skiing will be spoiled by rain.
Then, as the mercury plunges again,
the slopes become one sheet of solid
glare-ice, more suitable for ice hockey
than skiing. A temporary thaw, com-
mon in midwinter, can soften the snow
until it is as sticky as molasses.

you may find the resort frozen up or .

mountain range has four feet of the

nothing much can be done about this.

when you have learned to christy well
enough to attempt Tuckerman’s Ra-

There you will stand above the clouds,
in a feathery fairyland, alone or with
just one ski pal. You will linger there
in that amazing sunshine, gazing at the
awful drop ahead of you and kind of
wishing you were peacefully dead.
But you can’t stand there until spring,

“Drama has great value as a human resource for the individ-
ual,” writes Mr. Sherwood. “This can be a moving force for
patriotism and good citizenship; and it is highly important to
bring living drama to the youth of America.

“The work of the National Recreation Association in fostering
drama has been important for many years. I feel that this is a
basic contribution to our democratic traditions. The association

is in a strategic position to bring more drama on a nationwide scale to young people
because of its facilities and leadership and its relation and service to the recreation

forces of the country.

' “The Council of the Living Theatre, dedicated to the furtherance of drama for youth
as a preparation for mature living, welcomes heartily the expansion plans of the
National Recreation Association and is glad to cooperate in this significant effort.
It hopes that all other persons and groups recognize the potent social forces of the
living theatre. The two-hundredth anniversary of the American theatre, being cele-
brated in 1951, is a fitting time to remember that without a living theatre—as op-
posed to mechanized entertainment—we cannot pretend to have a national culture

in America.”

A DECEMBER REPORT of the Presi-
ent’s Water Resources Policy Commis-
on to study the nation’s water re-
urces and their uses presents a long-
nge worksheet of national objectives.
ne of its stated objectives calls for:
Providing for expanding cultural op-
ortunities, including all phases of rec-
eational development, from wilderness
reas to wisely-designed artificial mul-
iple-purpose reservoirs.” It is further
ndicated that the recreational use of
ater resources is one of the prime ele-
ents with which planning bodies
hould concern themselves. Last spring,
pon invitation from the chairman of
he commission, the National Recrea-
ion Association submitted recommen-
ations as to what the basic policy for
the recreational use of the nation’s
water resources should include, and has
been keeping in close touch with the
commission since that time.

0 IT IS ENCOURAGING to know that the
National Production Authority is grant-
ing exceptions to its Order M4 re-
stricting new construction for purposes
of amusement, recreation or entertain:
ment. Word has been received by the
Public Recreation Commission of Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, that such an exception
will permit the replacement of the Cor-
ryville and airport playgrounds. A let-
ter from W. H. Harrison, administrator
of the NPA, states: “Our review of the
data as submitted indicates hardship
will exist if you are not permitted to
proceed with the above projects. . .”

Another communication from the
NPA indicates that the construction of
an addition to the shelter at the Cali-
fornia Day Camp and Nature Preserve
is exempt from the provisions of this
order since “the structure is incidental
to buildings used for instructional pur-
poses.”

White Plains, New York, applied to
the National Production Authority in
November for permission to proceed

 

JANUARY 1951

 

with the construction of a garage and
toolhouse at Recreation Park.

The following extract from the letter
of the NPA indicates the basis for
granting an exception for this project:

“Based on the information contained
in your letter that it is required for the
housing of tools and equipment which
are used to maintain existing grounds
and facilities and that it is not con-
nected with any recreational, amuse-
ment or entertainment purposes, com-
mencement of the proposed construc-
tion is not prohibited by the provisions

of the Order M-4.”

9 AT A DECEMBER MEETING, the ex-
ecutive committee of the National Social
Welfare Assembly oHicially authorized
the creation, effective January 1, 1951,
of the Education-Recreation Division.
This is to replace the Education-Recre-
ation Council and the Youth Division
Of the assembly. Turning over their
concerns and responsibilities to the new
division, these two groups presented an
effective “last will and testament” in
semi-humorous vein, pointing up a
spiritual legacy Of the fellowship, full
freedom of expression and action and
the democratic procedures which had
marked all their transactions and rela-
tionships on cooperative projects when
facing a diversity of agency policies
and opinions.

O A RECREATION CONFERENCE, spon-
sored jointly by the California Recrea-
tion Commission, California Recreation
Society and the National Recreation

to attend, and Joseph Prendergast, ex-

partment, the Georgia State Recreation

of national agencies and local commu-
nity interests for the joint financing of
national defense services in the field of
health and welfare, was launched No-
vember 28, 1950.

Services to receive support from the
fund fall into two groups at present.
The first group is concerned with serv-
ices to the armed forces and will be
conducted by the American Social
Hygiene Association, Associated Serv-
ices for the Armed Forces (which in-
cludes Jewish Welfare Board, National

Sophie M. Drinker

HARD-WORKING professional musician who had come to
A our house one day to help us amateurs play and sing
expressed his understanding with the remark: “I wish I
had time to enjoy music!”

In our family, we do “enjoy” music. We enjoy it in the
same way that we do our food, our Howers, our pictures,
our books and all the other amenities of the good life.

“Our family” may be said to have been instituted when
I, a music-loving young woman, married a musically-
talented young lawyer. From the beginning of our ac-
quaintance, the love of music had been a bond. Almost the
first musical enjoyment we had together was listening to
Brahms’ Fourth Symphony. The inevitable rhythm of the
slow movement seemed like a march, leading us on to an
enduring companionship.

One of my happiest memories is that of singing folk
songs to my children. Every evening, after the last bed-
time story had been read, the last toy reverently placed, I
would sing three songs. And, now my children’s children
are asking for the same favorites:

0 bring again my heart’s content,
Thou, Spirit sweet of summer time . . .

The lovely, Spirit-bearing words and a beautiful sleep-
compelling melody are capable of charming both listeners
and singer.

Downstairs, in the music room, the pianos have always
been open, with music on the racks ready to be played. A
violin, viola and a flute lie upon the big oak table; a cello
stands in the corner. For what diversion is more absorb-
ing than playing instruments of music? Real amateurs—
those who love music—find it the most excellent of sports,
:specially when the sheer fun of playing and singing is
accompanied by a blazing woodfire, a cold beverage and
tall tales from good companions. A rare experience befell
us when the Trapp Family Singers moved to Merion and
lived for four years as our nearest neighbors. In a friendly
and generous spirit, they offered to let us add our voices to
theirs in the privacy of our music room. Best of all were
the evenings when Father Wasner would sing some of the
Gregorian plain chant melodies and explain how they had

become woven into the marvelous polyphonic motets of the
medieval and Renaissance ages. Had it not been for these
intimate meetings, we could never have learned to live the
music of the church nor to appreciate fully its complex
beauty.

Group Equipment

Group singing, indeed, proved to be the most rewarding
way to capitalize on musical technique acquired through
the years. I discovered that I could participate in much
more important music by singing in a chorus than by play-
ing the piano. I discovered, too, the thrill of hearing my
own alto part in strength—much greater strength than I
could ever have alone—and of holding to it confidently as
the other voices mounted and subsided on lheir own way.
The women’s chorus that I helped to organize and that sang
in our house for fifteen years, as well as our own Sunday
evening mixed chorus, has afforded me intense gratification
throughout the major part of my adult life.

This mixed chorus is the climax of our amateur musi-
cianship. It began twenty years ago, when we invited a

been coming practically from the beginning. Some are col-
lege boys and girls whose attendance is limited to their
college term. A few are transients. Over the years, more
than two thousand different musicians have sung with us.
Although “Accademia dei Dilettanti di Musica” is rather
a florid title for a group of average American citizens, it is
pertinent to every person who comes. In the days when the
rich nobles of Italy were the arbiters of fashion in music
and the organizers of artistic projects, “accademia” was

the word they used for their societies or clubs. There was s

the Accademia degl’ Illustrati, degl’ Intrepidi and so forth.
So we adopted “academy,” in emulation of these illustrious
and intrepid amateurs, and added to it “dilettanti”—those
who delight. For they had used the word as a designation
of worth, not with the modern derogatory connotation of
superficiality.

aECREATION

 

We are truly those who delight in music. Our object is
to enjoy music as a pastime, as one enjoys a good game
and, in the game, to grow receptive to music’s magic, re-
cuperatlve power.

At our accademia, each meeting is complete in itself.
There is no rehearsal, no preparation for any other occa-
sion, private or public. We have never given a concert,
even for invited guests, and we never will. Not that we do
not appreciate choral concerts and enjoy hearing them, but
we have an entirely different set of values. The signposts
we erect indicate an alternate route to musicianship. We
are interested not in what we can do to music, but in what
music can do to us.

The compositions, which we select with the greatest care
for each meeting, are the best of their kind. “Good music,”
incidentally, by no means excludes light, gay music any
more than good literature excludes Alice in Wonderland.
But if a vote were taken from the singers, Bach would
probably lead in popularity, with Brahms close behind. Our
practice is to sing the music in hand over as many times as
is necessary for the chorus to understand what the com-
poser is trying to say. Our ability to receive many musical
impressions is attributed largely to the fact that our sing-
ers and players are trained musicians, well-versed in the
idiom of different schools of music. They are, abOve all,
quick and accurate readers.

After the second winter of our musical experiment, my
husband decided to turn his hand to conducting and to
leading the chorus himself. We both realized the advantage
in having the host and the conductor one and the same per-
son. He judges what music to sing, when to repeat a dif-
ficult passage, when to proceed to something more reward-
ing. He appreciates the fact that, in our case, too much
repetition and drill would be futile effort and also incom-
patible with our aims. He foregoes the urge to play upon the
chorus himself as if it were an instrument-ma practice dear
to the hearts of all conductors. Many of our singers have
, expressed their delight in freedom from a conductor’s com-
plete domination, in the stimuius to musical responsibility
that is thus offered them and in their direct contact with
the composer as he manifests himself on the printed page.
Time after time, we all have been deeply moved by singing
an unfamiliar composition straight through from start to
finish without interruption, with only the rhythm main-
tained and the entrances indicated by the conductor’s baton.

Being an excellent musician himself, our conductor knows
exactly how he wants the music to sound. Now, if I were
to write that our rendition was invariably perfection, I
would be indulging in wishful thinking. Enthusiasm—noble
word meaning “the god within”—often prevents the di-
minuendos from being soft and sufficiently controlled; in-
experience sometimes causes the volunteer orchestra to
falter. But assisted by experts at the two pianos, who play
the parts audibly when needed, the voice of the chorus
always has a vibraiit quality, a spontaneity and a zest that
are frequently lacking in an overtrained group.

One Sunday, when we were singing our favorite Bach
Cantata No. 21, Ich hatte viel Bekummerniss, from the first
words, “Lord, my God,” to the last “Amen,” there was a

had a particularly virile tone quality. The rhythm throbbed
steadily in the bass voices, supported by the organ. \Vhen
the last note resounded, even before it had died away, the
singers immediately burst into applause at their own
achievement. They clapped and clapped and clapped again,
even stamping their feet, and shouted in exultation—so
profound was the joy, so deep-lying the satisfaction.

These are precious musical memories.

People often say to us, “Oh, but you are a musical family:
we could never do what you do!”

Certainly every family wou'd not wish to enjoy music in
exactly the same way as we do, nor could everyone have
identical tastes. Talents, skills and types of ingenuity differ;
circumstances and opportunities for the practical utility of
acquired techniques vary. W’e are not especially talented
individuals; no one of us could have been successful as a
professional performer. What has made us a so-ealled
“musical” family is our faith that singing folk songs and
Bach chorales with children will establish their musical
tastes for life; faith that having beautiful sounds float up-
stairs at bedtime and sink into their subconscious will bear
spiritual fruit; and conviction that music is necessary for
our own spiritual sustenance and growth. What has made
us want to share our enjoyment in music with our friends is
that we have need of them. Without their cooperation, we
could have no choral music at home.

Another element in our success is the point of view we
hold about the relation of the amateur to the professional
musician. The professionals are the specialists who come
and go, dependent upon the state of social and economic en-
vironment created for them by the people. The non-profes-
sionals are the main constituents of any community \Yhil h

roles are many. as many as there are. activities r wnnn‘ted
with any phase of music. As individuals. certainly. they

may specialize in some chosen precinct of music’s vast
realm, but as a group, their special function is not to limit
their interests to any one aspect of music. The essential and
indispensable role of the amatcur is to broaden the base of
musical experience, to experiment, to blaze paths away from
the beatcn track of custom.

It is obvious that there is today an overemphasis upon
the value of exhibition, to the neglect of other outlets for
musical enjoyment. \Ve do not learn to play games nor to
dance for the purpose of exhibition, but in order to culti-
vate good sportsmanship and pleasure in movement. Yet
from the nursery up through every stage of endeavor, peo-
ple are imbued with the notion that music must have an
audience and applause. Education in music is given largely
as if the student were going to become a professional per-
former, although but a comparatively small number are
ever expected to be, and a much smaller number become
successful performers. Most amateurs spend the major part
of their musical time in learning to play and sing for some-
body to listen, in helping others to play and sing for listen-
ers and in serving as audiences to professionals.

If we would but realize that this trend leads amateurs
toward a negative, passive relation to music and causes
them to forfeit a large part of their authority in the de-
velopment of artistic enterprise, we would surely abandon
the idea that the foremost reason for learning to play and
sing is to have an audience. We would not limit our inter-
ests and capabilities so narrowly, but we would cultivate

the idea that music may also be used as a game; an en-
joyment that, incidentally, has magic, spirit-bearing power.

To this end, we should make the language of music more
familiar to children. We should teach them the rudiments
of the language rather than a by-product of it by learning
to sing a song or play a piece without having first acquired
a sound musical background. These rudiments are: an ac-
curate sense of rhythm and pitch, pleasure in beauty of
tone; the ability to read at sight, to write from dictation
and to harmonize a simple melody. From such a founda-
tion, a talented person may proceed to the professional
level, if that be the level desired, or may take the way of

the amateur with its limitless possibilities for individual
expression.

And why stop at singing and playing? Why not learn to ._
wield the baton, too? '

There is no reason why an intelligent and musically-
sensitive person cannot master the relatively simple tech- I
nique of conducting. It is actually a much less exactingl
task than learning to play an instrument or to sing. I do
not mean, of course, that anyone with a Hair for leadership
can become a great conductor. Far from it. But greatness
is not here the criterion, nor box-office appeal the value.

  
  
    

Men or women, blessed with brains and personality, who
devote time to studying choral literature and the history of
music and who know exactly how they want.the music to
sound, may be entirely satisfactory leaders for choruses-
which have no desire to give a ,concert.

Indeed, the lack of capable amateur leaders for amateur
groups is the most formidable obstacle to choral singing
without concerts. Professional conductors must keep in the
public eye——or die. They are too busy with the advance-
ment of their careers to work with amateurs in the way that
I have described. But amateur leaders, whose music is an
avocation rather than a career, are free to approach music
from an entirely different and independent point of view.
Not only may they give themselves a very geod time while
conducting, but they may also do their communities ines-
timable service by offering opportunities for musical en-
joyment to more people.

The crying need in the musical culture of today is a
reformation of attitudes to allow greater participation of
musically-educated men and women in singing, playing,
conducting and composing, so that they may both feel and
utilize the power of music. For music actually gives access
to regions in the subconscious which are inaccessible to
many other impressions and which are the very holy of
holies of our perceptions. Music may be an important means
of helping an individual toward emotional maturity; it
could well be cultivated for that reason alone. So, to fer-
tilize the imaginative faculties with activity, to enrich lives,
even a few lives, is to add to the spiritual power of all.

This is the way of those who delight in music.

HEN DETROIT, MICHIGAN, opened
its General George S. Patton

Memorial Swimming Pool in Patton
Park, August thirtieth, it introduced to
its citizens a new and glamorous swim-
ming facility. Patton Pool, named af-
ter one of America’s greatest military
leaders, is believed to be the first com-
plete convertible swimming structure
in the country.

In summer weather, its huge, glass
south and west sliding walls open to
the sun and air and to a spacious sun-
deck overlooking the wading pool, la-
goon and other features of the park.
When wintry winds blow, the double
sliding doors remain closed to offer the
warmth and comfort of an indoor pool
and such features as a five-tiered bal-
cony for three hundred spectators, ample
space around the water, and far more
natural light because of the large pro-
portion of glass used for the enclosures.
Hot air heat (the air being heated by
steam) is circulated freely throughout
the building and through the one-foot
space between the doors. In fact, al-
though there’s been no chance to test
this system as yet, it has been said that
the pool can be kept at a constant tem-
perature of eighty-five degrees even
though it may be ten degrees below
zero out-of-doors.

Costing some $450,000, Patton Pool
is of competitive size, seventy-five by
forty-two feet, making it available for
championship meets. Its depth of from
three and a half to ten feet is in line
with such measurements in most pools.
Diatomite filters are used with a bal-
ancing or surge tank to assure a mini-
mum loss of water to the sewer. The
pool is of the level-deck type and the

curb, over which a constant flow of
water is maintained. A pipe tunnel
runs entirely around the pool for easy
maintenance. The pool itself is of tile
construction, boasting an aluminum
diving board priced at $325 and an un-
derwater lighting system.

Actually, although the convertible
swimming facility is the highlight of
the structure, the two-story building
which houses it also has a great deal

to offer. It now contains a warming

and social rooms. There’s also a room
for first aid as well as for pool filtra-
tion and sterilization equipment and
light control. The building, of brick
and cinder block, has been so con-
tructed that it will be convenient and
relatively inexpensive to erect a
planned-for-the-future gymnasium on
the north side and to include stage and
dressing room facilities and a balcony
for spectators so that the addition can
also be used as an auditorium.

The Detroit Department of Parks
and Recreation is determined that the
building shall be a fitting memorial to
a great soldier.

ADMINISTRATIVE
PLANNING

"Planning is the business of preparing for action.”

PART I

N MANY QL‘ARTERS concerned with the science of munici-
I pal administration, practitioners in the field of recrea-
tion are often regarded as persons whose skill and judgment
are bounded by the requirements of organizing and con-
ducting a recreation program; thus, for one reason or
another, many recreation executives have not been accepted
into the fraternity of municipal management.

Inescapably, the recreation executive must expand his
knowledge of public administration and play his full part
in the partnership of government practice. Unless this is
done, the recreation profession fails to make its distinctive
contribution to the philosophy and practice of community
organization and management, and may very well lose
ground when cyclical economic developments compel re-
doubled government searches for economy and efliciency.
While there is time, then, those in recreation must look ana-
lytically at their administrative practices and be consciously
concerned with the need to improve their staff operations.
A useful instrument in this process is “paper work,” by
which is meant something more useful, more necessary and
more diflicult than routine reports.

A significant area for improvement in the field of recre-
ation management lies in the discovery, modification and
utilization of administrative techniques which will result in
a smoother operating agency. Skill in administering a
budget or directing a personnel training program is not
more important than a thorough understanding of the phi-
losophy of recreation nor than great competence in the
design of facilities and areas or expert familiarity with the
intricacies and subtleties of program planning. There’s no
intent to belittle the importance of these components; on
the contrary, their value may be increased by development
of a method by which they may be more advantageously
employed. Therefore, it seems reasonable to claim that
good administration is that which will blend philosophy
and facilities into a successful recreation undertaking.

The planning processes which are required in securing
good administration are necessary and inescapable obliga-

tions of every governmental employee. It is a mistake
notion of more than a few technicians in many fields tha
their specialized training and high competence in a specifi
profession automatically bestow upon them an equal ski]
in the process of administering that particular specialty, s
that henceforth they are relieved of the need to be eve
curious regarding the processes of administration and ad
ministrative planning. This failure to comprehend the tru
role of the executive is today evidence of an undevelope
sense of proper public administration.

A Written Plan Essential

This article deals only with the method of administrativ
planning which is involved in the actual drafting and utiliza
tion of a written plan which will serve as a chart for de
partmental operations over a span of years. Certainly ever
recreation executive must have evolved a plan for' his de
partment, a mental picture of what he hopes to have th
department accomplish in the future. It is unfortunate, bu

associates also are probably carrying around similarly un-
written plans representing their hopes and ambitions for
the areas which are their personal responsibilities. When
you add to this the certainty that members of the recrea-
tion commission and the city council, and such municipal
ofiicers as the city manager and the superintendent of edu—
cation, are similarly “planning,” it becomes obvious that
there are a great many separate plans in existence. This
can mean that portions of the many plans may be forgotten
or that the various plans are in conHict with one another
because their existence hasn’t been recognized. The com-
plexities and responsibilities of modern administration!

ne master plan be developed as an expression of the
utual purposes of all. The master plan to be developed is

e executive’s counterpart of the architect’s blueprint or
he conductor’s orchestral score.

Administration has been defined as the art of getting

ings done. Planning is the business of preparing for
ction; its purpose is to give system and meaning to the
hosen action. Good planning is the fruit of collaborative

ort by all persons on the staff and of a free flow of in-
rmation and understanding within the organization. Ad-
inistration—and the administrative plan—is not some-
ring to be imposed upon subordinates. Planning which
akes place in an atmosphere of cooperation and respect for
' 6 contributions of each participant can he expected to
rovide the dividends as outlined in the box on this page.

The actual task of carrying out a plan is the function of
ll the employees, which means that the planning process
' ust include provision for adequate communication to in-
ure that the meaning and intent of the plan is understood
y all who must work with its ingredients and contribute to
ts accomplishment. Such'communication must include a
lear statement of what is expected of the individual and
ISO _illustrate how that performance contributes to the
ealization of the planned objectives. For example, in the
i old of education, students are taught by teachers, not by
he superintendent of education. Each supervisory level
bove the classroom represents an area where proper com-
I unication must take place if the plan-making which oc-
curred on the several levels is to be reflected in the class-
room activity. When planning attains this level, it includes

e whole process of organizing, orienting and coordina-
ting an agency’s internal and external operations, to the end
hat its goals are clearly defined and that the steps to be
taken in their achievement are logical, efficient and eco-
nomical.

The function of planning becomes clearer if our under-
standing of what administration encompasses is sound. Ad-
. inistration is the business of writing a letter just as much
as it is the negotiation of a complex agreement with other
community agencies to eliminate duplication of services.
It is the process of reporting to the city treasurer that the
department needs a larger petty cash fund just as much as
't is the operation of a city-wide summer program. In
short, administration is far more than the textbook picture
f participation in, and direction of, epic maneuvers. It is
the simple, as well as dichult, everyday acts and decisions
which, in the aggregate, become administration.

The Plan-Making Process

Planning involves a selection process. A number of
optional courses of action typically present themselves for
consideration whenever a decision of any consequence must
be made. Some method, some set of skills must be em-
ployed in sifting out the particular course to be followed.
The perception, the background, the philosophy, the goals
of the individual influence the choice made.

Three steps are involved in the plan-making process:
(1) The alternate courses of action must be recognized,

r followed by (2) an appraisal of the consequences which

i lANUARY 1951

can be expected to derive from each course of action, with
the final step being (3) the weighing of each course of
action against its consequences to determine which is the
most suitable to follow. If the plan has been worked out in
the necessary detail, supported by sufficient background
data, the sense of direction which naturally results from
such endeavor helps the staff more quickly and accurately
to make decisions which are consistent with the goals of
the agency.

Not too long ago it was considered sufficient to make
agency plans on a year-to-year basis. Today we are begin-
ning to formulate these plans on a long-term basis. This
extended planning acquires great value when properly done
because it provides the entire department staff, and particu-
larly those employees charged with executive responsibility,

Cooperation Offers—

1. A -means of guaranteeing that the problem has
been recognized and studied by the staff, that
methods of solving it have been considered ana-
lytically and that certain objectives have been set
up. (These objectives may be directed toward the
correction of dehciencies or the exploitation of
strengths.)

2. Professional motivation and stimulation. The staff
has something to “tie to,” a source of direction
which gives security and conjidence.

3. A rational and orderly sequence of administrative
and supervisory activities, eliminating vague su-
pervision, meaningless inspections and discon-
nected staj? meetings.

4. A degree of agreement and general understanding
upon which it is relatively easy to construct the
whole process of program and stag coordination.

5. A better understanding of the intended purposes of
the agency by municipal officers, board and coun-
cil members and the people of the 'community.

with a plan of action which is sufficiently comprehensive to
call for, and permit, deve10pment of long-range, over-all de-
partment organization and policies geared to the plan’s

attainment.

For completeness and coherence, it is suggested that the
written plan be organized into four statements. There fol-
lows herewith a definition of each of the four proposed,
together with extracts from a plan which was developed to
meet an actual recreation problem. While the problem
pertains to only one playground and reprewnts a span of
only six months, it is believed that the reader will draw
from this example an understanding of how a master plan
can result from combining a series of such incidental studies.

1. Statement of the Problem. (This section should deal
with the nature of the problem and a recounting of the
methods used in determining the problem. The state-
ment may be brief or lengthy, but it must be clear and

definitive.)

427

Playground attendance was poor. The reasons, as
discovered by inquiry among the children who repre-
sented the “market,” were found to be:

A. Parents wanted the children home after school, preferring
to have them playing in vacant lots or on the streets rather
than on the playground. The parents were not convinced
that the playground program was desirable.

B. The children had not found a sufficient variety of activities

in the playground program during the past to be interested
in daily attendance.

c. Tackle football was not permitted on the playground. The
boys, therefore, were playing in neighborhood lots where
they were free of regulation.

2. Statement of Objectives. (These need to be clearly

stated and must be achievable. Each should be inte-
grated with the over-all objectives of recreation.)

The objectives developed in the case of this par-
ticular playground problem were formulated as follows:

A. To make the playground a desirable and active neighbor-
hood center for the elementary school group whom it was
designed to serve.

B. To secure the support and understanding of the parents so

that they would cooperate with the stafi in better serving
the children of the community.

3. Statement of Methods to be Used in Attaining Objec-

428

tives. (How is it proposed to undertake accomplish-
ment of the stated objectives?)

A. Staff Reorganization

1. To insure that the necessary variety of leadership skills is
available;

2.To develop a varied and continuing program;

3. To revamp leadership processes, seeking to make leader-
ship more positive.

a. Public Relations

1. In collaboration with the school principal and class teach-

ers to develOp a planned program of advising teachers,
parents and children about program offerings. Methods
used to accomplish this included:

a. Contacts with oflicers and membership of the PTA to
acquaint that group with the problem the staff was
seeking to overcome, the reasons why the recreation pro-

gram was being offered and the recreation leaders’ need
for the parents’ assistance.

b. Conduct of school assemblies.
1. Films depicting recreational activities were shown.

2. Speakers. (For example, a local college football coach
was asked to speak to a special boys’ assembly on how
to play football. His talk was slanted toward the funda-
mental needs of learning how to run, punt and pass,
and how touch football ofiered these learning oppor-
tunities. He counseled the youngsters to learn the ele-

ments of football but to avoid injury which might
impair their future playing ability.)

3. One-minute visits to classrooms by members of the

recreation staff to call attention to special activities
which had been planned.

2. Utilization of playground bulletin boards, mimeographed
materials, newspaper releases and word-of-mouth to call
attention to the program. Even such details as the use of
colored chalk to letter notices on the bulletin board,
and change of location of the bulletin board to insure its
placement where it could be observed by a greater num-
ber of children, were observed in this campaign.

ground for a while suddenly ceased attendance. In prac
tice, one of the leaders would call at the home of the chi]
to learn if he was ill or to discover if there was some othe
reason which caused the absence which the playgroan
staff could remedy. This provided a friendly and informa

opportunity to become acquainted with at least one par
ent and to chat about what the recreation staff was at

tempting to do, frequently resulting in an offer of bot

moral and material Support from the adult members
that family.

4. Statement of Evaluating Procedures. (The methods t
be used in measuring progress of the plan must be se
up as a part of the planning process. They should b
formulated objectively and, in their subsequent appli
cation, the leaders should net claim the occurrence 0
unexpected events as part of the planned objectives.)

In evaluating the success of the plan, which starte
out with the intent of increasing playground attend

ance, a whole set of evaluative procedures was de-
veloped. For example:

A. Did playground attendance increase?

1. If so, to what degree?
2. What age and sex groaps were involved?
3. What activities gained the most in attendance?

4. What was the effect of seasonal factors in any note
increase?

5. What special and provable evidence is there that any in
crease noted is a direct product of the plan?
6. Has any noted increase in attendance become stable, or i
it spasmodic and unsustained?

B. Have relations between the playground staff and the com
munity improved?

1. What improvements resulting from the plan can be note

in the staff relationships with the school principal and th
teachers?

2. With the parents?
3. With the children?

C. How has the playground working situation improved?

1. In leadership—

a. How? (By what changes in technique?)
b. Where? (In what activities or situations?)
o. By whom?

2. In program offerings-—
a. How?

b. When?

c. Where?

d. Why?

e. By whom?
f. For whom?

In the long-range planning process, an adequate number
of goals need to be set up. Within reason, the effort shoul
be to avoid making little plans which have no magic to stir
anyone’s blood. The purpose of long-term planning is to
provide a realistic basis for making big plans—plans which
have far more scope than is possible if the plan-making i
restricted to the customary twelve-month basis. It is pos-
sible to develop a considerable number of objectives for
the master plan because many endeavors within a general
field complement each other. For example, a recreation
master plan that included as objectives the improvement of
child health, the provision of opportunities for the con-
structive use of leisure time, the organization of a more
extensive league and tournament program and the preven-

|
RECREATION i

tion of juvenile delinquency would find all four objectives
being accomplished simultaneously.

Plan-making will not be found to be an easy process.
This is particularly true in the beginning when it will be
baffling at times to sort out the items which belong in the
-. master plan and then to do the elaboration that is needed to
transform the topic into a course of action. In the initial
stages of plan-making, while one is learning what the proc-
ess is all about, it is probably most satisfactory to under-
take the planning in a gradual manner. The executive can
i" draw up as much of the plan as comes to mind, then set it
:; aside for a few days; a second reading will suggest addi-
tions and revisions, after which it may be put aside again
for further mellowing. Too, the rough plan may appropri-
ately be brought into staff meetings, where other members
of the staff can contribute to it and be assigned to start pre-
paration of their own plans and then can begin the process
of blending all the parts together.

The planner is cautioned not to concentrate exclusively
upon the dramatic and profound ideas, overlooking such
necessary parts of a plan as staff training or personnel selec-
tion. It is just as important to set up a plan to study ways
of reducing utility costs as it is to seek a means of securing
a budget increase. A plan which includes a process for

studying ways to produce a more satisfactory Fourth of
July program or run a better camp is likely to be better
oriented than one which vaingloriously seeks for some
philosophic understandings which, at the moment, are ir-
relevant to the agency’s immediate needs and purposes.

Despite all good intentions, planning will always fail of
its purpose to the degree in which it is dissociated from the
regular business of the agency. In the preparation of a
plan, two processes must be utilized. One is the technical
process of making the plan and keeping it up-to-date. The
second is the managerial process of putting it into effect
and maintaining its integrity. One final thing to remember
about planning is that plans are only a system of ideas
organized and set down for easy reference; in themselves
they do not make any changes or improvements and, in
their preparation or fulfillment, they are no better than the
staff is willing to make them.

Part II, “Making the Budget \Vorth Every Dollar,” will
appear in the February issue of RECREATION. In this, Mr.
Mitchell turns his attention to management processes which
will insure maximum productivity per penny spent. Says
he: “Probably the greatest cause of waste in the use of
recreation funds is the failure by management to utilize
adequately-available man hours.”

ARTS AND CRAFTS EXCHANGE

WITH JAPAN

LL PLBLIC recreation departments and programs are in-
A vited to participate in an arts and crafts exchange
between the United States and Japan. Plans for this proj-
ect have ust been formulated.

A selection of one hundred Japanese crafts made in the
recreation programs in Japan will be displayed at the
National Recreation Congress in Boston, October 1-5, 1951.
A similar selection of crafts made by boys and girls and
men and women in the United States will be on display at
the Japanese Congress in Wakayama, August 3-6. The ex-
change is a cooperative effort of the National Recreation
Association and the National Recreation Association of
Japan.

Crafts articles to be sent to Japan will be selected in a
nationwide competition open to all recreation departments
and agencies in this country. Since only one hundred pieces
can be sent to Japan, and since the whole program must be
very carefully planned, some important” rules have been
worked out.

Specific Instructions

1. Any hand-made piece can be entered in the competi-
tion, provided that it has been made in the course of an
arts and crafts program of some municipal recreation de-
partment or of some cooperating agency.

2. Judging will take place in New York early in May.
One of the judges will be Frank A. Staples, director of arts
and crafts of the National Recreation Association. The
other judges will be announced later.

3. Articles to be judged must be received not later than
May 1, 1951, at the oiiices of the National Recreation As-
sociation, 315 Fourth Avenue, New York 10, New York, in

order to allow time for shipment to Japan.

4. Only articles which, in the opinion of the judges, can
be shipped satisfactorily to Japan will be included in the

competition. Please do not submit fragile articles or those
which will crush easily.

430

a9.3

5. Winning articles will be selected on the basis of orig
nality, craftsmanship, design and usefulness.

6. No more than six articles should be submitted by a
one department or agency.

7. Winning articles selected for shipment to Japan wi
be turned over to the National Recreation Association .
Japan permanently for display and exhibit purpos
throughout Japan. All other articles will be returned .
entrant’s expense if requested; otherwise articles will -
kept by the National Recreation Associatibn for displa
and exhibit purposes within the United States.

8. The National Recreation Association cannot be r
sponsible for damage to, or loss of, any article sent. Article
will be acknowledged upon receipt. Every possible preca
tion will be taken to prevent loss or damage.

9. Each article must have a tag or label firmly attache
which provides the following information: (Please leav
space on tag for description of article in Japanese.)

Name of craftsman  ................................................. ..
Age ................................................................................ ..

City and state ................................................................ ..

Name of agency in whose arts and crafts program this

article was made .......................................................... ..

 

10. Submit separately from the tag any request for re-
turn of the article. Be sure to give name and address of
person to whom article is to be returned. Please also indi-
cate amount for which article should be insured.

RECREATION

 

HETHER or not you’re in a sec-
Wtion of the country that has white
winters, you’ll probably use the winter
theme for at least one of your parties
or dances.

The name you give to the event will
depend largely upon the type of affair
that you are planning. A formal dance
might be called a Snow Ball; an ordi-
nary dance, a February Frolic. Winter
Carnival sounds appropriate even for
an indoor party, and practically every-
one would be delighted to receive an
invitation to visit Jack Frost’s Fairy-
land or Winter Wonderland!

Regardless of the name, the decora-
tions can be almost the same for all of
these social gatherings. If nature hasn’t
been cooperative enough to frame all
the windows with snow and frost, don’t
worry. You can do a fairly realistic job
of it yourself.

First, get some white paper (type-
writing paper will do) and use one
sheet to make a pattern. Place one of
the corners of the paper in a corner of
one of the windowpanes. With a pencil,
outline what looks like a mound of
snow piled high in the corner and ta-
pered down to a thin line as it nears
the center. Cut out this pattern and
you’ll be able .to use it for all of the
windows.

Count the panes to see how many
mounds of snow will be needed. Then
pile several sheets of paper together,

IANUARY 1951

 

place the pattern on top and save time
by using a sharp razor blade to cut
through the entire pile—or a good por-
tion of it. Set someone else to take
on the task of pasting the “snow” on
the windows while you tend to other
matters.

The main entrance might be fringed
with a single strip of paper icicles and
guarded by a bed sheet snowman, com-

 

plete with hat, scarf and broom. He
could hold a sign that says “Welcome,”
or the sign might be hung over the
door itself.

When you start working on the hall
proper, try to remember to have large
eye-catching decorations which will help
create the atmosphere you want. Don’t
spend precious time on spotty little
bits that may easily go unnoticed. Con-
centrate upon the ceiling and large wall

spaces.
You’ll find that most large halls have

Are Your Parties in
Tune with the Season?

ceilings much too high to give a cozy
atmosphere. Perhaps your first prob-
lem will be that of putting in a false
ceiling. This really isn’t so hard, nor
so time-consuming as you’d think. One
of the simplest ways is to string some-
thing the width of the hall, just above
the reach of the tallest participant.

For a winter party you may want to
use strings of snowflakes. Almost any-
one can cut them out; kindergarten
children do! So don’t let anyone beg
off because “he’s no artist.”

Scientists say that no two snowflakes
are alike, so you won’t need any pat-
terns; just collect some heavy art or
construction paper, a few pairs of scis-
sors and a group of willing workers.

While these people are busy folding,
cutting and marvelling over their cre-
ations, you might get the twine or string
and start on the framework.

First, lay the string flat upon the
floor, the width of the hall. Then get
someone——perhaps the pe0ple who have
by this time finished putting the snow
on the windows—to tie short strings of
varying lengths to the one which you’ve
already measured. As soon as any
snowflakes are finished, staple them to
the short strings. Make as many rows
as you need. Many people can help you
with this since there’s hardly anything
that they can do wrong! Make a group
project of it: it might even warrant a
preparty party or scru- as a valuable

431

 

and interesting club project.

On the night of the party itself, re-
member that background music is
always good to help create a mood and
get people into the spirit of the thing.

In this instance, numbers such as Jin-

gle Bells, Skaters’ Waltz, Let It Snow,
Let It Snow, Let It Snow and Walk-
ing in a Winter Wonderland would be
appropriate. If you can arrange to have
small, light paper snowflakes fall dur-
ing one or two of these numbers, it will
be an added attraction. Electric fans,
strategically placed, might help keep
the snow in the air.

At a dance, or any party where
you’re lucky enough to have an orches-
tra, you might talk the musicians into
donning stocking caps, ear muffs,
scarves and so forth for their special
numbers—particularly vocal solos.

At the parties, or during the inter-
mission at the dances, you- can stage
several winter events. The fact that
they’re held indoors on a bone-dry
dance floor simply makes a ski or a
snowshoe race that much more hilari-
ous. Relays which involve getting in
and out of snow or ski boots, or even
overshoes, can be amusing from the par-
ticipants’ and spectators’ vieWpoints.

One of the western Massachusetts
college groups has a game so enter-
taining that people are arranged in cir-
cles so that they can all watch each
other perform. The leader gives a
lady’s zippered handbag to one of the
players, who must Open the bag, take
out and put on the pair of ski mitts he
finds inside, take out and open a pack-
age of gum, put one piece of gum
(minus paper) into his mouth, return
the rest of the gum and the ski mitts to
the bag, which he zips and passes on

432

to the next player. The team finishing
first wins-——probably an elaborately-
wrapped package of chewing gum!

If your winter party takes the form
of a dance, yourcan use that snowman
from the front entrance—or any other
snowman you might want to assemble.
One of the ladies starts dancing with
“him” while everyone else on the floor
dances with the partner of her choice.
But the lady is anxious to get rid of the
snowman and get herself a real partner,
so she tags any other lady, presents her
with the snowman in exchange for her
partner. This is just a novel way of
running a ladies’ tag dance and lends
a little fun to the occasion.

For your lucky number, or elimina-
tion dance, you might try wrapping a
small piece of paper with a number on
it in a ball of cotton. Each couple on
the floor receives a ball. At a pause in
the music, the leader draws three or
four numbers from a duplicate set at
the microphone. The couples on the
floor must open their cotton balls to
find their number. If theirs is one of
the numbers called, they must then
leave the floor. The music and dancing
are resumed. At the next and subse-
quent pause in the music, the proce-
dure is repeated until only one couple is

left on the floor. This couple, of course,
wins any prize you may care to award.
During this number, if you wish, you
can have people on the floor exchange
numbers by throwing their cotton balls
to someone else. The only problem here
would be that one person might collect
two or three balls while someone else
might have none! However, if you

.know your group well enough, you’ll

know whether to try this variation.
Refreshments can fit into the scheme
of things, too. Popcorn balls look like
snowballs (so do marshmallows) and
Eskimo pies, ice cream of any kind
and popsicles are cold enough for win-
ter. These might be served by “Eski-

mos” or warmly-dressed individuals
from a spot decorated to represent an

igloo, the North Pole or Iceland. If the
weather is really cold, your group
might be ust as glad to have hot choco-
late topped with marshmallow.

Before the close, or maybe at the
very end, of your party or dance, you
might want to teach “Take a Little
Look at the Northern Lights” or “Patty
Cake Polka” to the tune of Jingle
Bells. At any rate, do everything you
can to create the impression that Winter
has arrived (indoors, if not out) and
that there’s no time like snow time.

 

February Party Themes

A“famoas” party honoring not only
George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln, but all the people in the spon-
soring group who might have achieved
fame, or the most famous cook, the
town’s most famous athlete, our famous
band, a famous coach, sportsman,
dancer, singer, skater, dressmaker.

We see many silhouettes of George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln, so
why not silhouettes of other famous
folks?

Set up a lamp so that it shines on an
ease] or a wall where you’ve placed a
sheet of drawing paper. Have each
guest, as he arrives, stand between the
lamp’s rays and the paper on which his
shadow will fall. Anyone can outline
the profile. The guest takes this to a
table where there’s India ink and
brushes. He makes his own silhouette
and then hangs it upon the wall some-
where, takes it home later.

One of the events of the evening

might be to see who can identify the
greatest number of silhouettes.

A Woodchopper’s Ball on February
12—with the song of the same name
used as the theme—could feature an
intermission novelty based upon chop-
ping wood, even if the woodpile is only
a pile of toothpicks.

A Rail Splitters Social for February
12 to which folks wear old clothes and
do old-time American Folk dances.

A Hatchet Hop for February 22.

A modern skit, take ofic on henpecked
husbands and forgetful fathers, could
be entitled “Fathers of Our Country.”

A Sweetheart theme might be used,
too. Pictures of girl friends and boy
friends can be displayed in a locked
glass case on appropriate-sized heart
cutouts.

Truth or Consequences is another
good February game since people pat-
terning their behavior after George
Washington cannot tell lies.

S

RECREATION i

 

T 15 NOT uncommon to have a recre-
I ation director say, “What can we
do for girls in a recreation program?
I don’t know anything about them or
what they prefer!”

This probably explains the fact that
too often the program offered is a

warmed-over version of a sports pro-
gram which has pleased the boys. Most
recreation directors agree that an ade-
quate program for the girls is a neces-
sary and vital essential of any good
community program; but what to do
and how to do it remain baffling ques-
tions.

First, let us make girls proud of the
fact that they are girls, and give them
an understanding and appreciation of
the importance of the role they are to
play as homemakers, wives, mothers,
professional women and citizens in a
democracy. Every phase of their pro-
gram should make a contributiOn to a
happier and fuller life for them and for
those for whom they will be responsible.

It is no longer possible to pigeon-
hole responsibility by drawing vertical
lines and saying that that is the job of
the school and that is the job of the
home—or the church or the private or
public agency. The lines go horizon-
tally and, in every case, the girl is the
most important consideration. We, in
recreation, have a golden opportunity
.to accomplish much because we work
with people who come of their own

free choice. We hold them only as we
hold their interest.

A successful program for girls should
start at an early age. The natural in-
terest of the seven and eight-year-old
in “playing house” is the perfect back-
ground for developing the homemaking
skills. With good leadership, setting
the table properly, being a good hos-
tess, learning how to sew and to do
simple decorative crafts, making a bed,
washing and ironing dolls’ clothes are
delightful experiences instead of chores.
With their natural Hair for make-be-
lieve, storytelling and dramatics are
musts in a program. Girls love to dress
up and give shows.

Group singing and rhythmic activi-
ties belong here, too, and there should
be plenty of opportunity for vigorous
play through the use of low-organized
games. There also is a need for more
active recreation to build health and
endurance. This is the time to teach
skills which will be needed in their
choice of games at a later age. Table
games—dominoes, checkers, parchesi—
puzzles and magic tricks all have an
appeal. Since they like to sort, classify
and arrange, it is not too early to start
interest in hobbies. All little girls from
eight to twelve love the word “club,”
and almost any activity with that label
will catch their interest. Their natural
curiosity about things makes it an ideal
time to introduce nature activities—
identification of flowers, birds, animals,
trees, sea life—and to have camp ex-
periences. Above all, they need fun
and laughter—a feeling of belonging

PROGRAM FOR GIRLS

and of being important. They need
top-notch leadership, for they are usu-
ally fond of their leader and will imi-
tate her.

At about the age of ten, there is not
much companionship between boys and
girls; yet here is the time when the
leader can do much to make the com-
ing teen years happy ones. Take a look
ahead and see what activities are going
to be needed for the boy-girl interest
which is just around the corner. Re-
member that the adolescent years are
filled with potentialities for tragedy and
despair or for happiness and high ad-
venture. Just as the teen years are a
preparation for adulthood, so the pre-
teen years are a preparation for that
thirteen-to-nineteen-year span.

Health and personal attractiveness,
self-confidence and the ability to do
things will be very important. Keep
right on with skills and creative activ-
ities but begin to discuss things. What
makes a person attractive? What do
you have to do to have good health?
Social training and experience belong
in this pre-teen program—for nothing
gives one more poise than knowing the
correct thing to do.

Youngsters need to learn to face
reality, to accept situations as they
really are and to act accordingly. This
saves many heartbreaking experiences
in the teen years. A chance to discuss
their worries and problems with a wise
and understanding adult is a valuable
part of a program for them.

By all means, emphasize the activi-
ties—active, quiet and group games,

433

roller skating, outdoor sports, swim-
ming. bowling, ice skating, dancing,
music; drama, crafts. A good founda-
tion for social dancing should have
been built up through folk dancing,
play party games and rhythmic activi-
ties at the earlier age level.

It is most desirable that activities
with boys be included all along the line
mfor they pave the way for good so-
cial relationships. Puppet-making,
crafts, music and so forth are enjoyed
together long before the youngsters are
ready for dances.

The early adolescent thirteen and
fourteen-year-old girls are in a period
of rapid growth and development. They
are trying to find themselves. Odd be-
havior, constantly-changing social
groups, short—lived interests and the de-
sire to plan on a higher level than they
can execute are all characteristic of
their age.

It is important that the leader strive
to deve10p principles of democratic pro-
cedure, for undemocratic organizations
are very common at this age. The basic
program interests can be carried on,
but the girls are now ready for more
service activities. Community volunteer
projects, work with younger children
through an assistant leader’s course,
home nursing, first aid and child care
are appealing. There is great interest
in cooking and sewing, crafts, club ,
groups, team sports and social affairs.
Questions of etiquette are matters of
life and death! They talk about the
boys all the time—but their social af-
fairs will need quite a lot of adult help
in planning if they are to be successful.

The middle adolescents—fifteen and
sixteen years of age———are ready for
games requiring much higher skills
and, although the girls are still inter-
ested in team games, they show a pref-
erence for individual Sports such as
badminton, tennis, bowling, archery,
swimming, winter sports and, of course,
social dancing.

Corecreation programs are very much
needed, but their sc0pe should go be-
yond social dancing, table tennis and

men are valuable. They are ready for
more good citizenship projects which
develop from an understanding of their
own community needs.

The later adolescent years—sixteen
to eighteen—should reap the harvest of
the previous ten years of good prepa-
ration. Interests have been stimulated,
skills given and standards and appre—
ciations established. Girls of this age
Wish to appear grown up and adult, but
a deeper desire is to be accepted by
their own group and to find new status
outside the family circle. They are
ready to accept greater responsibility
for the conduct of their own affairs,
but need adult guidance. They have a
real need for success, and being popular
and well-liked are of major concern to
them. They are interested in social,
economic and political issues of the
day—and good program material can
be worked out around these interests.
While they enjoy some all-girl activi-
ties, their main interest is in corecre-
ation programs. Girls of this age make
fine junior leaders for younger girls.

As usual, leadership is considered
the most important part of the entire
set-up. Strange as it may seem, it is
much more difficult to lead girls’ groups
than boys’. The former seem to need
more personal attention, more assist-
ance in getting things started and more

 

BROTHERHOOD WEEK
February 18-25, 1951

Sponsored by National Conference of Christians and Jews

“We talk about building bridges of brotherhood around the world in answer
to the communist pretensions, and that’s a splendid vision. But brotherhood
begins on a man-to-man basis at home and not on a mass-to-ma'ss basis across
the oceans. Without that footing, it is idle talk and an empty vision.

“We can’t afford to blind ourselves to the disturbing and undermining
racial and religious antagonisms in America. They will defeat our good inten-

tions for world brotherhood until we cast them out and live as brothers in our.

encouragement to keep them going.

The leader should exemplify the qual- I
ities which she wishes her girls to de-
velop. Good grooming, good health,
charm, social adequacy, Specific skills
in some fields, and a general knowledge

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

of many more, a more genuine interest
in girls, a knowledge of psychology,
patience, a sense of humor and a sense
of proportion are some of the qualities
such a leader should possess. No leader
is worthy of the name if she believes
her responsibility is merely to direct
activities. What counts most is what is
happening to every individual in her
group. Activities and programs are
merely a means to an end, and that end
is richer living and extended horizons.
While all leadership is important, that
of working with girls is doubly so——for
the things we teach can be so far-reach-
ing. Mothers who have had a happy
childhood and have learned the essen—
tial ways of creating a good life will
want to do the same for their children.
Family solidarity and happier homes

RENO’S CLOWN BLLEY

RENo’s CLOWN
ALLEY was origina-
ted by former big-
time circus clown,
Ed Beisel, who now
teaches the tricks of
clowning and make-up to others. The
alley has a membership of eighteen
local businessmen, with four additional
apprentice clowns. Any local man in-
terested in old-time clowning traditions
is eligible to join, and there are no
fees, dues or special assessments. How-
ever, each member must provide his
own costume. Anonymity is maintained
for all clowns by having correspond-
ence pass through the recreation de-
partment ofiice.

The group has set up strict policies
regarding performances—no perform-
ance will be given unless there are at
least four hundred people in the audi-
ence, and no performance will be given
to promote private interests.

Clowning is serious business. Just
the applying and removing of make-up
takes close to an hour. Then, too, cos-
tumes must be clean and neat for each

performance-"which, by the way, draws
the wives into the act. Learning the
various gimmicks which make people
laugh also takes many hours. A great
deal of planning and preparation goes
into each performance and the men
work long and hard designing and
building props for new. routines. Be-
cause of the cost of materials involved,
Clown Alley accepts donations but does
not solicit funds nor request payment
for performing.

It is sponsored by the Reno Recrea-
tion Commission, which provides a
room in the community center for
weekly rehearsals and storage space for
props.

Activities

The biggest show in which the clowns
participate is the annual Community
and Playground Circus. Last year,
more than two hundred fifty children
took part in the two-hour show, and a
capacity crowd of three thousand was
on hand for the fun. Clowns performed
eight times during the event, with such
stunts as the clown barbershop, the
Superman skit and a version of the
busy bee.

participated during the past year in-

addition, individual members of the
alley have performed at many birthday
parties“, neighborhood get-togethers and
other community functions.

Simpson Clown Club
Back in 1948, at the annual Shel-

ton, Washington, forest celebration,
an employee of the Simpson Logging
Company conceived the idea of a
mock tree-planting machine, run by
grotesque characters, to amuse the
spectators. It was the hit of the show
and out of this beginning came the

Simpson Clown Club.

More than fifty employees were
admitted to the organization and
taught the secrets of creating an ef-
fective clown get-up.

Since their organization, the Simp-
son Clowns have traveled several
thousand miles entertaining at civic

other

celebrations, parades and

important events.

ANY HOBBYISTS enjoy making miniatures, and one of the most delightful
M ways of indulging this desire is to make miniature gardens~—-yes, real,
living gardens—on buttons! To prove how simple it is, these pictures show
how a tiny cactus garden can be made, complete with sand and peat moss, in a
very short time. By adding a few drops of water about once a week, you can
persuade it to live contentedly for months. Other than a button, a small
coaster, a milk bottle cap or any tiny dish with holes in it for drainage could
be used. Small, slow-growing kinds of cacti and succulents comprise the plant
materials, and little sea shells, pebbles and bits of broken rock and bright-
colored glass can be added to give variety in texture and color.

This Business of Counting Attendance

ECAL‘SE it seems important that
B those who have responsibility
should know the reasons
things which they are expected to
do, the Long Beach, California, Recrea-
tion Department frequently refreshes
the thinking of its staff on the subject
of attendance-recording and reporting.
The method used by this department
has evolved over a period of twenty
years, becoming m 0 re simplified
through elimination of detail of doubt-
ful value while, we believe, increasing
the value of the record by making the
basic factors more reliable.

Our department has endeavored to
keep informed as to the thinking of
the National Recreation Association’s
research workers and committees and
has adOpted their findings and sugges-
tions as far as possible. A big step
along this line was our adoption of the
recommended formula which utilized
the peak count in the morning, after-
noon and evening periods. We believe
that we have a good method and are
confident that, in the language of an
NRA bulletin on the subject, “the
formula . . . represents the most au-
thoritative method of recording at-
tendance that yet has been devised for
general application.”

In one particular we have found it
necessary to vary our practice some-
what from the NRA committee’s recom-

The importance attached to accu-
rate reporting of attendance in Long

Beach is indicated by the fact that in
addition to verbal and mimeographed

instructions to the recreation staff. a
bulletin was prepared and distributed
to members of the recreation commis-
sion explaining the use of the atten-
dance-taking formula.

formula is, of necessity, much broader
than this. In Long Beach, we have an
all-year program with nearly as much
activity in the winter months as in
the summer. We use the formula the
entire year because its value is as great
in one month as in another.

in the direction of the playground.
Sometimes the total of spectators re-
ported grew to such enormous figures as
to become more than Open to question.

Accusations against the veracity of
playground directors was evidently
not the prOper approach. It seemed
plain that some directors were greatly
confused as to just what constituted a
spectator. The blame was placed ex-
actly where we thought it belonged—
upon the attendance-taking system then
in use. This is what we set out to
correct. How well we have succeeded

the reader may judge. Perhaps our sys-

 

tem still needs fixing, but of one thing
we are very sure—it is far better than
any previous system used in Long
Beach. Perhaps an explanation of this
system will prove of value to those
whose problems are similar to our own.

The Weekly Attendance Blank

I In the first place, the weekly at-
tendance blank is used primarily to
report area or recreation center at-
tendance rather than specific activity
attendance; the latter consideration is
supplemental. This, we believe, is an
essential in" order to use the formula.

Section A-B of the blank, reproduced
on the next page, is for general at-
tendance. child or
adult coming to the playground or cen-
ter is counted under general attendance
unless he is counted under Section C
or Section D. The formula is used in
reporting general attendance; peak at-
tendance for the morning is multiplied
by 2, for afternoon by 2.5, and for
night by 1.5. The director reporting is
instructed not to take the peak count
less than an hour before an event is
held at the area and listed under Sec-
tion C, or less than an hour following
the close of such an event. Columns
are totaled and the attendance for the
week is entered in the weekly summary
box opposite A-B and under the col-
umns headed “participants.”

Section B is for organized groups
and major activities and is for par-
ticipants only. It is in this section that
much of the information concerning

that B is a part of AB and the at-
tendance has already been counted
there.

Section C is for special events, con-
tests, tournaments, concerts and pro-
grams and, for the first time, the
spectator gets consideration. Another
'element is included here, for columns
are provided to check whether or not
the event was sponsored or assisted by
the recreation department. The purpose
of this is to enable us to give the proper
credit to any other agency which might
be involved when reports are published
or comment is made. Figures under
Section C are totaled and then entered
in the weekly summary box opposite
C and under the sections headed “par-
ticipants” and “spectators.”

Attention is called to the fact that
while area directors are expected to
comply with the general plan of this
report blank, they also are expected
to exercise good judgment and to re-
alize that some situations are at vari-
ance with the general rule. As an ex-
ample, suppose that at a given area
an activity which, in most instances,
would be listed under B with a count

lANUARY 1951

of participants only takes on a greater
significance. Let us say that an ath-
letic team sport is regularly played.
It is not a special event but a regular
program feature at the area; yet it
does have spectator interest. In such
a case, spectators should be counted
and the easiest way to accomplish this
is to report the activity under Section
C. As specific activity reports are
made up from all sections, the entry
of attendance under Section C in such
cases causes no problem in the even-
tual analysis.

Another point emphasized in con-
nection with counting spectators is that
spectators are from outside the area,
attracted by the activity in connection
with which they are reported. It is
possible for an individual to be proper-
ly counted as a spectator and also as
a unit under general attendance—but
not at the same time. The time element
is the important consideration here.
As is evident, our entire system of
is based upon

and not upon

attendance-recording

“units of attendance”

“different persons.”
Section D is used almost exclusively

for reporting clubhouse and recreation
center use by independent organiza-
tions which pay a fee for the privilege.
The recreation staff representative in-
volved in such cases seldom acts in a
capacity beyond that of custodian.
One test of such situations is that if
the staff employee concerned is ac-
tually serving as a leader, instructor
or supervisor, then the attendance rec-
ord belongs in a different section.

Cumulative Attendance Card

The weekly attendance report blanks
are turned in to the central office
where, through the use of work sheets,
the information from each area is
compiled on a monthly cumulative at-
tendance card. This filing card car-
ries forward the information—so that
at any given time the record of any
area for any month is available and, in
addition, the fiscal year totals to date.
Upon the reverse side of the card, ac-
tivity data are entered for convenient
use in surveys or reports concerned
with the patronage of the various ac-
tivities organized and directed.

THOSE ATTENDING the meetings on

state recreation services to commu-
nities, at the National Recreation Con-
gress, agreed in general that a need
exists for recreation service at the state
level. It was felt that local communi-
ties desire assistance from the state
along such lines as community organi-
zation, facility development, finance,
research and general promotion. There
is a need for a plan which provides
means for greater cooperation and co-
ordination of effort between existing
departments and cooperating agencies
in order to make more effective the rec-

reation services, materials and resources
of the state.

There was considerable discussion
of the subject of state financial aid for
local recreation programs, with some
difference of opinion on its advisability.
Those in favor thought that adminis-

tration of aid might follow the method
used in education, that certain mini-

mum standards should be maintained,
that general, but not specific, controls
should be provided, that financial aid
would help to stimulate some local pro-
grams. Those with questions about
financial aid pointed out the necessary
accompanying controls. They felt that

home rule and tax equalization would
provide the best source of funds for
municipalities, that recreation is a local
responsibility, that local initiative
should not be stifled by outside finan-
cial aid and controls.

The Tennessee Division of State
Parks has recently been placed under
Civil Service, the result of an effort di-
rected toward this goal begun several
years ago. With this in mind, the divi-
sion started early to set up personnel
standards so that if and when Civil
Service should become a reality, the
organization would be ready for the
transition. Last year, Governor Brown-
ing announced that the division would
be placed under Civil Service, follow-
ing a request by interested conserva-
tionists who had realized the importance
of qualified personnel in these recrea-
tion positions.

The change did not occur overnight,
however; the Tennessee Department of
Personnel devoted much time and study
to the drafting of job descriptions. It
found that there was little precedent
established in the country since there

are only a few state park departments
under Civil Service. Therefore, after

RE YOU interested in starting a

Golden-Age Club? Are you afraid
of that first meeting—the “how-to-do-
it” part? If so, here are some helpful
hints as to how to go about your first
club meeting, as well as information
about the recent starting activities of
two clubs. Both of these were fun; each
was very different; and both actually

worked 1

Helpful Hints:

1. Have some organization sponsor
your club—to be responsible for public-
ity, transportation, facilities, program,
decorating, refreshments and so forth.
The sponsoring agency should, after
the first few meetings, indirectly get the
group itself to plan and direct its own
programs while the agency stays in the
background, “keeping the machinery
oiled and moving.”
2. Be careful of overtiring and over-
feeding the guests since you are not
sure of the condition of their health.

3. Direct activities which you are
sure all can do and will enjoy, par-
ticularly at this first meeting. Some
may be very active, while some may
not have played in years.

4. Try to lead their thinking toward
some active as well as passive game fun
for future meetings.

5. Decorate halls simply but beauti-
fully, with chairs arranged in four (or

Club Number One

This club, co-sponsored by the W0-
man’s Club and the Department of
Public Recreation, was furnished by
the recreation department, which helped
with some of the planning; the W0-
man’s Club had charge of everything
else.

There were only four days to pre-
pare for the first meeting because they
wanted the NRA training specialist to
direct the activities. Therefore, good
use was made of the.phone, radio and
newspapers to tell members of the com-
munity: “If you are between the ages
of eighty-five to one hundred twenty-
five, come and have fun at the recrea-
tion center on Friday morning from
ten to twelve. And if you are not quite
old enough to join this new club, please
come and help.”

Friday was a disheartening, rainy
day so we felt that there would be very
few, if any, oldsters who would come
out in such weather. Imagine our sur-
prise when more than fifty arrived-—
many in their eighties and two in their
nineties.

Following is the party plan used.
Several last-minute changes were made
to avoid tiring the group.

Preparty Games—As the guests ar-

rived, a group of several members of
the Woman’s Club (not a reception
committee) escorted them to a table
where two other volunteers registered
their names and addresses. Then they
were given a large, six-by-ten red heart
of cardboard and a pencil and told to
collect the 'names of as many people as
possible to write upon the heart. We
helped in this, even writing for some
who asked us to do so.

Getting them into four groups was
the next step, and this was done by
using the old favorite game of asking
for a show of hands of all those who
were born in the four seasons—Janu-
ary, February, March; April, May,
June; July, August, September; Octo-
ber, ' November, December. Then, not
knowing if this would work or if they
would think it silly, group one was told
that they were “ducks” and would say
quack, quack; group two were “cats”
and would meow; group three were
“turkeys” and would gobble, gobble;
group four were “pigs” and would oink,
oink.

Players now had to walk around the
room, making their own particular ani-
mal sounds and finding all others who
were making the same kind of noise.
Everyone had a wonderful time being
ducks, pigs, turkeys and cats and, when
the game was over, all were given their
particular “cozy nook” corner where
the chairs had already been arranged.

Now all the guests were seated and
each group was given a pencil and a
sheet of paper and asked to select its
own chamean. This chairman then for-
mally introduced members of the group
to each other and was then asked to
write down the names of songs guessed
by his group during the following
game.

Musical Romance

As the pianist tells the story, play-
ing the suggested songs, guests try to
name the selections being played. The
group naming the most songs wins.

This is a story that happened Long,
Long Ago in The Good Old Summer
Time. The notes of the stately Wed-
ding March could be heard sounding
through the Trees on the wedding day
of the lovely Juanita and her handsome
lover, Robin Adair.

' 441

For the wedding trip, they went
Sailing to the distant lands and not
even when they were Rocked in the
Cradle of the Deep was their happiness
crowded for a single instant.

After seeing the sights of the old
country. they came Merrily, Merrily
back to America, the Beautiful. Back
in Dixie they were met by Old Black
Joe, who took them over the rolling
hills to see the Old Folks At Home.

Their first quarrel came because
Robin was always late for his meals.
Juanita would stand waiting by the

Old Oahen Bucket, sighing Oh Dear,
What Can the Matter Be?

One night as he came an hour late
for his meals, she met him In the Eve-
ning by the Moonlight and, uttering
the Battle Cry of Freedom, packed up
and went to her Old Kentucky Home.

Robin thought of his sins All Through
the Night and, in the morning, wired
her, I Love You Truly. She wired back,
Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old
Kit Bag for I’m coming back to Home
Sweet Home.

All Smiles, Robin met her In the
Gleaming, and from then on life for
them was one Perfect Day. Even after
time had sprinkled their hair with Sil-
ver Threads Among the Gold, life for
them was a continuation of Love’s Old
Sweet Song.

At the finish of the story, guests
were asked to sing Love’s Old Sweet
Song.

Next each group was asked to select
its “smartest man.” The men were told
to try and guess the word being drama-
tized by their group. Each group was
given the same wordsu—such as gossip-
ing, cooking, preaching, musician—and
it was fun to see how disgusted the
other players would become if their
“smart man” was slow in guessing.

Since the groups had been seated
long enough, they were asked to get
acquainted with the guests in the other
groups. All were instructed to stand
and form a circle in the cleared space
of the room.

One person was asked to step inside
the circle and start walking around. At
a signal (the leader clapped his hands
once), he would st0p and introduce
himself to the person nearest to him,
ask his name, take him by the hand and

442

start walking around the inside of the
circle talking together. Here we sug-
gested that they talk aloud so that we
could hcar the gossip.

When a second signal was given
(the leader clapped twice), they were
to say “good-bye” and walk around in
single file. Again, at a signal, they
would greet the players nearest to them,
repeating the previous action until
everyone had a partner.

Now we were ready for the first musi-
cal mixer and guests were again asked
to get acquainted with others in the
group and then join inside hands with
their partners. All were asked to walk
four steps forward around the circle
with their partners (leader says aloud,
“walk-234”); drop hands and face
partners; walk four steps backward
away from partners (“back-234”).
All point with right hands towards
partners; then move hands to right to
point to another person standing be-
side partner who now becomes the new
partner. All take four steps toward their
(“point-234”), and
shake hands saying “How-do-you-do”
(same rhythm as “walk-234”). The
action is repeated to enable everyone to
have several new partners.

While participants took time out for
refreshments, the leader told them of
other golden-age clubs around the
country, how they Operate and how
much fun they offer. He then asked for
a show of hands to see how many there
would like to meet weekly with this
club. All hands went up and the presi-
dent of the Woman’s Club told them
about future plans and suggested that
they come prepared with a name for
the club on the following week.

Club Number Two

With little time to advertise and evi-
dently very little publicity, only two
men came to our beautifully-decorated
hall. Both men, who were over eighty,
discovered that they lived not too far
from each other and that each was re-
tired and lonely for companionship.

Since there’s not too much that can
be done in the way of activities with
two people, the “never fail” method was
usedH—trick games with cards and coins
as well as pencil and paper “you-guess-
the-answer” games.

We had wonderful fun and one of

more pe0ple for the next session, an
the sponsoring agency definitely
promised many more for the following
week. We then told the gentleman with
the mental game hobby that he would
be in charge of that part of the pro-
gram and asked him to teach his as-
sistant (the other guest) so that if there
was a large crowd the following week
both of them could be “Mr. Wizards”
and entertain. They immediately made
plans for meeting for rehearsals.

RECREATION

 

0 PLAN a diversified summer rec-
reation program for ten, fifty or
even a hundred children is a challenging

task for anyone. But to plan, organize
and integrate such a program for 150,-
000 youngsters seems almost incredible.
Especially when those children are scat-
'tered in areas throughout the United
States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay, Hawaii, J apan, Tonga,
Samoa, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia,
South Africa, Palestine, Great Britain,
the Netherlands, France, Switzerland,
Scandinavia and some parts of Ger-
many. Yet such was the accomplish-
ment of the leaders of the Primary
Association of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Members of the primary are children
four to eleven years of age inclusive.
They are taught by volunteer adult
leaders who conduct primaries in groups
ranging from five or six in a home unit
to more than two hundred in larger,
well-organized wards.

The objective of the association is

to furnish week-day religious and rec-
reational education to children. The
year-round program stresses spiritual
and moral teachings and provides op-
portunity for growth and development
through a variety of individual and
group activities. Keeping in mind the
“whole child” and his need for leisure-
time direction, particularly during
school vacation months, emphasis is
placed upon the summer recreation
projects.

The 1950 summer program was
based upon a broad international theme,
with the premise in mind that knowl-
edge, understanding and appreciation
help to build friendship and good-neigh-
bor attitudes. A study of the customs,
clothing, food, arts, crafts and folklore
of four representative peoples of the
Christian world formed the background
of the course. Divided into age groups,
the children learned about the ways of
the American Indians. the South Pa-
cific Islanders, the Scandinavians and
the inhabitants of the British Isles. They
became acquainted with the folk tales
of these peoples, played their games,
sang their songs and prepared and ate
their native foods.

A CHURCH PROGRAM
FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN

Folk dancing also had a prominent
part in the planned activities, for it is
as old as the folkways from which it
sprang, and no land has lacked in
native dances. The rhythmic swaying
and bending of the body and the lively
vigorous footwork involved have a ther-
apeutic value in the development of
healthy boys and girls. Aside from sup-
plying a form of exercise, it feeds the
spirit, and whoever takes part in a folk
dance carries away some feeling of ex-
uberance and of friendship.

Primary boys and girls went still
farther in trying to understand their
neighbors of other lands. Most chil-
dren love to make things; so, under the
supervision of their leaders, they learned
the skills of many peoples and fash-
ioned innumerable crafts articles, both
ornamental and practical.

The culminating feature of this sum-
mer of fun and achievement was the
“Summer Festival” presented by each
local group of children, near the elev-
enth of August, the birthday of their
organization. Each festival was a glori-
ous outgrowth of the season’s actii ities,
where the children, dressed in the na-
tive costumes they had fashioned,

443

danced to the rhythmic beat of tom-
toms or demonstrated the Maori .Poi
Dance, Highland Schottishe, English
Maypole Dance, Swedish Clap Dance,
Danish Polka and others.

Another interesting part of each fes-
tival was the exhibit of handcrafts made
by the children. The exhibits included
such colorful items as the following:
Indian drums, tepees, rugs, pottery and
war bonnets; native out-rigger canoes,
palm trees, leis, grass mats; English
bread boards, knitting, crocheting;
Scandinavian embroidery, belt purses,
curtain trims, boats and door knockers.

These articles were viewed by the
parents, who joined in the “good time
together” and watched and listened to
their children sing. dance and drama-
tize what they had learned and enjoyed
in primary classes.

And, now—How was it done?

Planning of the program in all its
details was done by one central board
of thirty-six women, trained and experi-
enced in child leadership. They met in
Salt Lake City, Utah, headquarters of

the Primary Association, to plan, pre-

 

pare and publish.the outlines of in-
struction for the summer work.

During the first week in April, a
two-day convention was held in Salt
Lake City for the leaders of approxi-
mately two hundred areas (or stakes)
where primaries are held. Each of the
larger areas is divided into five to
twelve smaller divisions, each with its
own organized group of children. Dur-
ing the two-day convention, area leaders
met in workshop sessions and attended
large scale demonstrations conducted
by the “general board” of planners and
instructors. Details of the summer pro-
gram were thoroughly discussed, and
the actual “know-how” of carrying'them
out was taught.

Returning to their homes, area lead-

ers in turn conducted similar meetings

for grOUp leaders under their supervi- .

sion, teaching and demonstrating th
methods and goals to be achieved.

Area and group‘leaders of the Pri-
maryAssociation number more than 26,
000—21 veritable army of understand
ing and qualified women whose o ‘
aim is to encourage and influence f0
good the girls and boys they are priv
ileged to teach. Inasmuch as all servic
are free, teaching primary is truly .
“labor of love.” Because of their gen
uine interest in the needs of children
the leaders put unbelievable eflo'rt an
enthusiasm into the preparation an
consummation of their plans.

The outstanding success of the 1950
summer recreation program of the Pri
mary Association is evidence of the un
tiring devotion to the cause of healthf
and purposeful recreation for childre

The joyous, eager response of
thousands of children who shared bu
and happy summer days is ano
monument of achievement—a glorio
adventure of children learning to t
friends with all the world.

I ET US FIRST look at some of the

needs in the lives of individual
American citizens which must be met
somehow if these individuals are to live
happy and full lives. Hobbies can help
meet some of these needs. Some lead-
ers in the recreation field have identi-
fied recreation as a fifth freedom—
along with freedom of speech, worship,
freedom from want and fear—the free-
dom and opportunity to choose one’s
own enjoyment, to add life to one’s
years. A hobbyist chooses such free-
‘dom. Our elders in the past have told
us that free time can be an asset or a
liability, depending upon one’s capacity
to appreciate it and use it. The person
who rides a hobby, making good and
enjoyable use of his leisure, will not
worry about too much free time,
whether it be forced or chosen and,
upon his retirement, he will find it to
have been a blessing rather than a
curse.

It is estimated that only about fifteen
per cent of youth and young adults in
America have their abilities developed
and needs met while in school or on
their jobs. The real worth and abilities
of the individual—the things he can do
best—are often not realized. Neither the
school nor the job offers those basic

satisfactions necessary for happier,

more joyful living.

Efforts in the hobby field are a step
toward more healthful living, if we ac-
cept the concept that health is “a state
of complete physical, mental and social
well-being and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity.” Slavson, in
his book, Recreation and the Total Per-
sonality, identifies the real contribu-
tion of hobbies and of recreation as a
means of meeting the needs of the in-
dividual in this contemporary period of
frustration, and the need for vigorous
release of emotional tension.

What then are some of these needs
which must be met in the lives of all of
us if we are to live more fully? First,
there is the above-mentioned need for
some means of emotional release——the
active sort of release which William
James suggested when he referred to
the value of the woodpile for this pur-
pose. We see men and women who are
tense under the strain of noise and
speed; we see them bored and cramped
by tedious routine; we see them fretful
with nerves worn raw by petty strife
and the worry of wrongs, real or im-
agined. We have seen such persons
come out, after spending an hour or
two with their hobbies, made over and
with new light in their eyes, a look of
freshness, ready again to tackle their
jobs.

A second need is the need of friend
ship. One of the very important phases

We
Hillllll WWW?

H. D. Edgren

in our American way of life is the mak-
ing and keeping of friends. The impor-
tance of this is self-evident to all of us.
Hobbies can lead to socialization or
friendship through the joining of a
group of people with like interests,
through sharing and trading in corres-
pondence. There is no need for a
hobby to be used as a means of with-
drawal from people, although it can be
enjoyed alone as well.

This leads us to the important need
of being accepted by, and belonging to,
some group. Our psychiatrists tell us
that “Individuals simply must have, if
they are to have any sense of worth at
all, a feeling that they belong and are
making some valuable contribution to
a group.” We have seen, in our own
experience, many illustrations of the
timid girl, the over-aggressive boy, the
individual who is unwanted because of
lack of skills or some personality dif-
ficulty. .

Closely related to the above is the
need of all of us to be engaged in some
activity that is all-absorbing—one in
which we can completely lose our-
selves-a cause to champion or activi-
ties or events in which we can enter
with complete forgetfulness of self. To-
day, recourse to alcohol and other nar-
cotics appears to be the only way open
to many, suggesting some inadequacy
of experience in these lives. Two other
needs are those for recognition and

445

new experience- Because the rank and
file of young people are non-adven-
turoUs. afraid to try something with
which they‘re not familiar, the oppor-
tunity for new experience is not shared
by many. Recognition is a need which
is most likely to be filled when one of
the other basic needs is met—that of
belonging to groups. Through sharing
a new experience, working and playing
together, come the identification and
recognition from others.

How do hobbies meet some of these
basic needs? I would not be so naive as
to suggest “Ride a hobby, live longer
and enjoy complete living.” There are
other things which are important; but
I do belie\e that people with hobbies
have a greater chance of achieving and
satisfying some of these needs. What
does a hobby get you? It can be more
than a release from work; it can be the
transforming power that can help make
life full and abundant. Secondly, the
opportunities for creative self-expres-
sion are nowhere found to the extent
that they are found in a hobby. It is
yours; good or bad you did it and, be-
cause you did it your way, it is likely to

be good. You have not been dependent
lipon anyone else to “blow a whistle to
start you off”; it has been yours to do
in your own way.

Next, in terms of friendship and a
sense of belonging, your hobby expe-
rience can be the means of making new
acquaintances and lasting friendships.
People are drawn to the place where
they can get acquainted by sharing ex-
periences. A real hobbyist wants to
share his interest with others. Through
this sharing, real friendships are made,
irrespective of religion, race or nation-
ality; it is the interest in the activity
that brings individuals together.

Your own sense of worth, your be-
lief in yourself, the self-confidence that
has come with working at something
and completing it—this is one of the
things a hobby gets you. Many indi-
viduals today are afraid of solitude, un-
happy unless they are in a group. A
hobby can be the means of developing
inner resources which can make life
full even when alone. To you, who may
now have hobbies, we say develop oth-
ers. The many of you who must spend
a great deal of time in other work, in

this business of making a living, will i__

find your real enjoyment in living

through your hobbies. Think twice,

too, before you stop with thinking of ,

your present interest only as a hobby,
for in it or something like it you may
find your life’s work. The happiest
people today are those whose hobby in-
terests have become their permanent
jobs. Regardless of whether you move
from a hobby to a vocation, or con-
tinue with it only as your leisure-time
interest, remember that you have not
only the opportunity of enjoying it,
but the obligation to stimulate others
to join you in this thrilling experience.
You can make your hobby a social in-
fluence by inviting others to join you
in your experimentation and explora-
tion of this interest. Then you can say
with the poet:

“He drew a circle that left me out;

Heretic rebel and a thing to Hout;
My hobby and I had the will to

win,

We drew a circle that took him

MAGICIAN '

SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD boy was
A standing in Newspaper Row,
Washington Street, Boston, awe-inspired
by a demonstration given by the famed
magician, Houdini, one day in 1922.
A college student visiting his father’s
art studio in Boston, the boy was part
of a large crowd. To Sidney V. Wright,
the study of magic and legerdemain
was a hobby. But inspired by Houdini’s
‘ feat that day back in 1922, he then and
there decided to study carefully and
learn the difficult ramifications of presti-
digitations. And he did, for he became
“The Fantastic Magician” and appeared
for three years on the B. F. Keith the-
atre circuit.

He reports: “My first interest in

magic began at the age of twelve, when'

I was watching a street faker selling
small tricks. He told me that if I would
get him a pail of water, he would give
me a ball trick. I got the pail of water
all right and ran home with the ball
trick to show my powers of magic; but
the ball would not disappear. He had
not shown me how to operate the trick.
However, after studying the problem, I
discovered that the ball did not vanish
by supernatural powers, but by an in-
genius method. This made me want to

learn a great deal more about the me-
chanics of magic.

“It was hard to get information at
that time, but I did get a book and be-
come acquainted with a magician who
taught me many clever sleights. Today
there are many books on magic in our
public libraries and also magic dealers.

“I gave my first full evening’s show
at the age of sixteen. At eighteen, I
saw Houdini get out of a strait jacket
and that convinced me that I should
learn all that there is to know about
magic and magicians. I am still learn-
ing. It was during my college days that
I was asked to perform for a fee; and
as students asked to be taught various
tricks, I was able to pay for my edu-
cation.”

A theatrical critic in describing Mr.
Wright said: “His magic is pleasing
and unusually fascinating in its swift-
ness, producing startling effects, such
as only a man of lightning speed and
versatility is capable.” After retiring
from the theatrical field in 1930, “The
Fantastic Magician” made use of his
experience as a showman in organizing
and directing dramatics, recreation and
hobby programs throughout Massachu-
SCIIS.

He states: “I discovered that magic is
a hobby which covers many phases of

 

recreation. To be a magician, one must
be an actor; therefore, we enter dra-
matics. In order to create and build
new tricks, we march into arts and
crafts. Then there is the social aspect,
the pleasure of private practice to de-
velop skill, finger exercise for sleight of
hand. In fact, I studied piano to
strengthen my fingers. Music, too, is
a part of the picture.

“Magic is used in my work as Hyan-
nis director of recreation as a public re-
lations device and in gaining interest
when speaking to groups. Occasionally
I perform for clubs professionally.”

During the war. he organized arts
and crafts in army and navy camps and
brought shows and produced them for
the benefit of servicemen. He also con-
ducted athletics such as baseball, bas-
ketball and various other tournaments
in the camps. At the request of the
United States government, he organ-
ized craft programs on the ill-fated air-
plane carrier, The \Vasp.

Sidney \Vright came to Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, in November 194- l-.'when
he was appointed supervisor of the Hy-
annis Community Center. He attended

addition. he has taken courses in philos-
Ophy and the administration of recre-
ation. He has lectured at the University
of Massachusetts. Hyannis State Teach-
ers College, and before women’s clubs,
Ixinanis, Rotary, Lions, Masons and
Knights of Columbus on different types
of hobbies.

0n Cape Cod he is known as the
“Creator of Hobbies,” because he has

organized so many types of leisure-
time activities. Among these are metal
crafts, jewelry, leathercrafts, ceramics,
oil painting, photography, coin collect-
ing, magic clubs, stamp collecting, na-
ture lore, wood inlaying, seashell col-
lecting, marionettes, puppets, block
printing on cloth and paper and dec-
orating all types of household furnish-
ings. He has been active in organizing

tournaments in basketball, baseball, vol-
leyball, swimming, boxing and table
tennis.

In spite of the fact that he is perhaps
one of the busiest men on Cape Cod,
he does occasionally manage to find
time to di5play his skill and hobby per-
forming feats of magic before clubs,
lodges, churches, private parties ‘ and
other groups of the community.

 

Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett

Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett, noted sports
supporter and founder of the National
Playing Fields Association of Great
Britain, collapsed while speaking at a
sports meeting at a London hotel, De-
cember 2, and died a few minutes later.
He was sixty-eight years of age.

Sir Noel, who made his career in
civil service, was a former assistant
secretary to the Treasury. He was in-
terested in all forms of sports and was
a member of the International Olympic
Committee as well as of many other
sports organizations.

On a visit to the United States in
1948, he addressed the headquarters
staff of the National Recreation Associ-
ation, stating:

“Playing fields are the training
ground for those qualities of mind and
spirit which, in combination, are the
bases of our common heritage and our
common ideals and strivings. I refer, of
course, to the qualities of individual
effort and initiative combined with
team effort and the team spirit.

“You will, I know, agree with me
that . . . we need to cultivate these
qualities more than ever before if the
civilization of free men is to survive.
. . . For the maintenance of liberty and
of social stability demands that our
young people shall be given the facili-
ties for healthy games; the facilities for
cultivating their individual capacities
while at the same time acquiring the art
of working together for a common end.

“That the capacity for world leader-
ship of our two great peoples owes
much to this capacity to play games—

and to play the game—is readily ad-
mitted by every thinking person . . .

448

In my judgment there can be no doubt
that the complete failure alike of com-
mUnism and authoritarianism to make
headway in Great Britain is to be
found in the fact that our people, what-
ever their status or occupations, mingle
freely in the fellowship of sport. The
playing of games unquestionably makes
for social and political stability of a
very high order.”

Sir Noel was chairman of the Na-
tional Playing Fields Association, vice
president of the National Association
of Boys Clubs, vice chairman of the
British Olympic Council and chairman
of the National Sporting Club Execu-
tive Committee.

William M. Mullen

The sudden passing of William M.

Mullen, sixty-two, director of recrea-
tion for the Boston, Massachusetts,
Park Department, on December 7,
marked the close of a distinguished
career.

Joseph Lee, Boston Associate Park
Commissioner, writes: “To me he was
one of the most impressive persons I
ever met. He was one of those rare
public officials who could not resist a
new idea and never failed to make it
blossom beneficially.”

Director of recreation since 1930,
William Mullen created Boston’s out-
door Gay Nineties shows, children’s
amateur circuses, soap box derbies, the
Mayor’s Field Day fund-raising spec-
tacles, Huck Finn fishing contests, chil-
dren’s May Day festivals on the Com-
mon, amateur boxing contests for play-

 

ground participants, Halloween parties
throughout the city and public barn
dancing.

Last year, more than eleven thousand
participants played more than ten thou-
sand official games on over six hundred ‘
teams to a total of three million on- '

" lookers during the basketball, football

and twilight baseball and softball sea-
sons in an organized league system of
which Mr. Mullen was the architect. In
fact, one of the favorite sayings at-
tributed to him was: “Give me a foot-
ball and fifty square yards and I’ll save
five boys from reform School.”

In addition, he was a life member
of the Basketball Officials” Association
and former president of its eastern
board. He also had been president of
the New England College Baseball Of-
ficials’ Association and served as ref-
eree of the Boston Traveler-Chevrolet
Soap Box Derby since its inception in

1935.

ATHER RAN HIS fingers through his
hair as he continued to read to the

 

attentive little group about him.

“‘It’s quite a long time since you
did any poetry,’ Mole remarked. ‘You
might have a try at it this evening, in-
stead of—well, brooding over things so
much. I’ve an idea that you’ll feel a lot
better when you’ve got something jotted
down—if it’s only just the rhymes.

“ ‘The Rat pushed the paper away
from him wearily, but the discreet Mole
took the occasion to leave the room,
and when he peeped in again some time
later, the Rat was absorbed and deaf
to the world, alternately scribbling and
sucking the top of his pencil. It is true
that he sucked a good deal more than
he scribbled, but it was joy to the Mole
to know that the cure had at least be-
gun.’ ”

There was a moment of silence as
father used an old postcard to mark
the place and then closed the book.

“Please, couldn’t we have one more
chapter?”

“Not tonight. The end of a chapter
is a good place to stop.” ‘

“Could we just look at the pictures
again before we go to bed?” asked the
eight-year-old.

Father turned to the Arthur Rack-
ham illustrations appreciatively. This
was his first reading of Kenneth Gra-
hame’s Wind in the Willows, and he
found his own enthusiasm for it equal
to that of his children.

be heeded—and the adults who do so

will gain immeasurably for many have
missed certain gems in their own child-
hood. What an experience it is to dis-
cover them with your children!

Children know nothing of the “best
seller” list, and any book they have not
heard before is a new book; they take
it to their hearts and love it with not
so much as a glance at the date of pub-
lication. The breathless excitement of
Treasure Island, the tang of humor in
Just So Stories and the simple charm
of Heidi are as fresh and pleasing to-
day as when they were written.

There should be a certain amount of
dramatic emphasis used by the reader
so that the characters come alive and
the scenes are perceived vividly by the
listeners’ inner eyes. A boy, after hear-
ing his father read descriptive passages
of the Mississippi River in Mark
Twain’s Huckleberry F inn, said to his
mother, “Gee, Mom, I do like it when
Dad lets himself go on reading. Sure
is neat.” What the boy didn’t know
was that his father was seeing the beau-
ties of the great river for the first time.
These he had missed when he read the
book as a boy; and now his enthusi-
asm crept into his voice and the pic-
ture was made whole for his son.

Whenever the material permits, chil-
dren should take their turn as readers
in the family reading circle, for it helps
to develop a pleasant speaking voice,
diction and tone. Reading with “fun
in your voice,” as one child put it, and
pronouncing words clearly should im-
prove conversational inflections. Close
your eyes at any party and listen; the
need for improvement in speaking

voices is altogether too apparent.

To say that the life of a leader in
recreation is a busy one is an under-
statement; but sandwiched in-between
professional commitments there should
be some time, budgeted if need be, for
a period in which to read aloud with
one’s own family. The living together
in the scenes of a well-loved book will
create a common bond of interest which
will remain as long as there is a son or
daughter left to remember.

The current question as to what tele-
vision is doing to the reading habits of
young people is as interesting to rec-
reation workers as to those in the field
of children’s literature—for what af-
fects the young affects us all. In the
family with the well-established habit
of reading aloud, a television set may
provide suggestions and stimuli for a
more varied and interesting reading
program than any that the family has
yet experienced. However, a parent must
be alert to suggestion. Western movies
on television might well lead to the read-
ing of Will James’ Smoky, and the re-
cent presentation of Little Women to
many pleasant hours with the ageless
March family.

Television, like radio, is here to stay,
and though we may bemoan certain as-
pects of inferior programs, we must be
ready to use those better portions which
can add to the cultural background of
the young placed under our guidance.

Carefully-chosen material can give a
child a literary taste which will en-
rich his whole life. Much of a child’s
integrity, self-confidence and appreci-
ation of the rights of others can come
from the books read to him if they are

449

of the best quality. Everyone reads
some trash sooner or later, but the child
given a good background in his own
family is less likely to succumb to the
tawdry. vulgar fare offered in many
comics and in other cheap material.

Young people need emotional stabil-
ity and spiritual understanding to tem-
per their living in this modern world.
One of the best ways of acquiring these

A Lively Archery Program

L'NTINCTON PARK, California, is

the home ground of an active and

strong archery club, where the club

program includes not only activities on

the range, but hot cake breakfasts be—

fore the shoots, pot luck dinners and an
annual Christmas party.

In 1939 a group of amateur, but en-
thusiastic, archers founded the club
which today is known as the Hunting-
ton Park Archers. On city-owned pr0p-
erty, now the Municipal Recreation
Park, willing hands set about clearing
a field large enough for tournaments.

You may now drive to within one
hundred feet of the shooting line. Here
you will find a well-cared-for field of
closely-cropped grass, a building for
storing club property and patio-type fa-
cilities for picnic lunches. Rest rooms
adjoining the held are modern, clean.

The field itself is carefully surveyed
so that the line of fire is due north. The
fine backstops are a permanent type,
the city furnishing new hay each six
months. These items make it one of the
most popular ranges in California.

hold monthly tournaments
Generally, the
rounds recognized by the National
Archery Association are planned for the
day’s shoot, but two or three times dur-
ing the year a novelty shoot is in order.
The big event of the year is the annual
championship held in May. At the ban-
quet the evening following the tourney,
appropriate trophies and medals are
awarded to the winners. Eleven months
prior to May, every member devotes
the largest part of his leisure time to
practise on the range in order to make
this the most hotly-contested tourney
of the year—at the same time receiving
all the benefits of clean, healthful, re-
laxing outdoor exercises. Relaxation is
the innate keynote of archery success,
both therapeutically and competitively.

The beginner or junior archer, if he
desires, receives willing and expert as-
sistance even to the point of being
loaned or given unused tackle by the
Huntington Park archery members. A
junior club is sponsored and supervised
by the senior organization. It is a club
within a club, .in that the juniors handle

the method used in teaching it. Poetry
is as fragile as a delicate piece of filmy
lace and, like it, cannot be made whole :
again if clumsily torn apart. The beauty If
of sound and thought in poetry is ap- 
parent only when it is read aloud intel- 
ligently in its entirety. Adults may be-!I
gin to enjoy it for the first time while 1
introducing it to their children. Read-
ing poetry aloud may well make a meet-
ing place where youth and adults find
the best in each other.

Walter de la Mare once said, “I know
well that only the rarest kind of best in
anything can be good enough for the
young.” Leaders in leisure-time activ-
ities can do much to introduce “the
rarest kind of best” in literature into
their own family circles and into the
family circles of those they lead.

their own funds and elect their own of-
ficers. Also, a great deal of help is given
to them by the recreation department.
Each year, during the summer months,
the archery range is the site of a day
camp for school children. Under th
supervision of competent instructors
furnished by the department of recrea-
tion, regularly-scheduled classes are of-
fered. Enrollment is overflowing.

Archery is a sport beneficial not only
to individuals but to an entire group.
So it is natural that the club should
affiliate with, and adhere to, the rules
of such larger organizations as the
Southern California Archery Associa-
tion, the California State Archery As-
sociatiou and the National Archery As-
sociation.

Each month at the business meeting
in the city recreation building, refresh-
ments and entertainment follow the

business details. This is also the site of:

 

other gay and enjoyable feasts.

Thus, the Huntington Park Archers
work together and play together for the
mutual benefit of all and to provide the
finest in recreation, so necessary to the
welfare of everyone in this very busy ‘
community. i

NATIONAL COMMITTEE
studies RECREATWN

ROGRESS in the development of a
Pstandard form for reporting the
services of public recreation depart-
ments is reported by the Committee on
Statistics for Public Recreation, ap-
pointed in 1950 to study this problem.
Recreation Executives have long recog-
nized the importance of keeping accu-
rate records of recreation service. Yet
the problem of securing, tabulating and
using attendance and service records
baflies many recreation departments, in
part because of their limited staffs and
budgets.

Some executives attempt to avoid the
problem by keeping few records. As
a result they do not have access to in-
formation that is essential to effective
administration and fiscal and program
planning. At the other extreme are rec-
reation executives who adopt report
forms which call for excessive detail.
Filling out these forms requires time of
staff members that might better be de-
voted to program planning and activ-
ity leadership. Furthermore, the data
entered on the reports are so volumi-
nous that a careful analysis of their con-
tents is seldom possible. Workers tend
to become careless in filling. out their
reports when they realize that these are

not read promptly nor studied with
care.

Among the main objectives of the
Committee on Statistics for Public Rec-
reationrare:

(1) Determine the kinds of records
which are most useful to the recreation
department and which can be secured

452

RECORDS

readily and used effectively. Each de-
partment must determine for itself the
types of records essential for its needs
and which should be furnished through
the reports of its workers. The recom-
mendations of the committee, however,
will indicate the basic types of records
which are considered of primary im-
portance and which can be secured
with a minimum expenditure of time
and effort.

(2) Prepare simple, yet adequate,
report forms which permit the easy,
accurate recording of the essential data.
Some forms in current use yield little
information of value to the recreation
department; others are too complex
and call for information that cannot be
supplied readily by the individual work-
ers using them. Report forms are often
so arranged as to provide either too
much or too little space for entering
the data, or as to make tabulations dif-
ficult. It is expected that these short-
comings will be avoided in the form
devised by the committee.

(3) Provide a set of instructions for
the guidance of persons who are to
submit the data. Procedures must be
indicated and terms must be defined
clearly if report forms are to be filled
out accurately and uniformly and if
records are to be useful for compara-
tive purposes. When the interpretation
of the forms is left to the judgment of

the individual workers, reports should I

clearly indicate the procedure to be
followed in entering the data.

(4) Outline a procedure for compil-

ing and using the reports submitted by
the individual workers. Executives can-
not justify the expenditure of time by
their workers in preparing reports un-
less they themselves make full use of
the information recorded. Some de-
partments have not set up effective pro-
cedures for accomplishing this. The
committee proposes_to outline a sug-I
gested procedure whereby the records.I
submitted by individual workers can-
be consolidated into a report for the!
department as a whole.

A REPORT FROM

GROUP of college leaders sat down
to thrash out some problems to-

other in a discussion meeting on the
bove subject at the National Recrea-
ion Congress in Cleveland. In sum-
arizing their discussion, the general
eeling seemed to be that the size of
he college campus necessarily is a de-
ermining factor in reaching any de-
ision as to where administration of a
ampus recreation program belongs.
They agreed that a recreation di-
rector may be attached to the physical
ducation department or to the office
f the dean of women, the dean of men
or the dean of students to effect a co-
rdination of recreation activities.
uch an arrangement is sound in prin-
iple but diflicult in practice. An alter-
ate arrangement is that the director
hould not be under any one depart-
ent but should supplement all depart-
ents. This would mean that, as co-
ordinator, he would perhaps report to
[he president through the provost of
e university. The coordinator should
rave a policy-making council made up
of faculty members and students. Coun-
cil members might be recommended by
Ee dean of students and appointed by
e president. The latter system is being
suggested at the University of Illinois.
There are bound to be overlaps in
any system of administration since it is
difficult and time-consuming to work
out who is to govern what. Three divi-
sions were considered under adminis-
tration:

ATIONAL RECREATION CONGRESS*

Recreation on the Campus

to finance the campus recreation pro-
gram, such as:
1. Student union fee, with funds ap-

portioned for activities.

2. Student fund, made up of one
dollar per student per year and
controlled by the students advised
by the recreation director. The
college pays staff personnel. The
director may have a separate bud-
get from which he can supple-
ment the program funds.

3. Dance fund, such as at Oberlin.
There, if more is earned than ex-
pected from a dance, the extra
goes into the dance fund. If
there’s a deficit, a withdrawal is
made from the dance fund up to
one half of the total of that fund.

4. Regular university budget. The
group felt that the recreation pro-
gram should be included in this.

B..Personnel—It is not easy to find

suitable candidates for the position
of recreation director or coordi-
nator. Qualifications should include:
1. Academic standing. Candidate
should have good relationships
and contacts with the faculty so
as to be able to work more easily
with faculty members. He might
teach in the recreation depart-
ment.

. Personality appealing to students.

. Youth. He should be young enough
to be close to students and yet
have dignity and be old enough
to maintain standing with the
faculty and administrative officers.

4. Familiarity with the school. He
must know the administrative or-
ganization of his university.

C. Program—The group had time to

COM

discuss only one program problem.
The suitcase-college has many stu-
dents who go home on week ends.
For those left on campus, the Uni-
versity of Denver plans day and
week-end trips, providing a bus and
station wagon as transportation. If
the director can encourage other
faculty members to go as chaper-
ones——especially taking their fami-
lies—he is left free to plan with those
remaining on the campus. Trips are
an Opportunity for the faculty and
students to meet outside of class.

Other colleges plan mostly social
programs, such as Open house teas,
dances or informal activities.

It was suggested that the coordinator
should use members of the recreation
club and recreation majors in working
with groups. His job is leadership, and
these students can obtain valuable ex-
perience from him.

The scheduling of the campus cal-
endar and facilities is a real problem.
A student policy committee, rather than
a single person, is needed to make the
decision on such questions as that of
giving joint service when the gym floor
must be used for both basketball and
cultural activities. (It was suggested
that Borax Spangles could be used on
the floor for a dance and be m0pped
up with squeegees afterward.)

Passing from the three administra-
tive divisions, the group considered two
further problems regarding campus
recreation.

l. The need for a continuous pro-
gram to interpret to the faculty the
campus recreation program.

2. The need to educate students for
wise use of leisure time in college and
for adult life; to teach them recre-
ation skills. A required cultural course
in recreation for all students is needed
in order to expose them to a variety of
activities—especially those which can
be practiced by the individual in later
years. New York University conducts
such a course, entitled “Personal Liv-
ing.”

The following studies have been
made of campus recreation:

ation Studies Done in Far West States”

From Hobby to Business

T HAT A HOBBY can be more than just
a pleasure is best demonstrated by
two Pekin, Illinois, women who are
making good use of their hands, and in
so doing have turned hobby to profit
and have established a venture that has
the earmarks of apotential, full-fledged
business. Their talents, incidentally,
were developed in the handcrafts classes
sponsored by the Pekin Playground
and Recreation Board. The two friends
have combined natural talent for art
with shrewd business instincts to set
the groundwork for their business ven-
ture, which they have named “Celestial
Arts.”

Specifically, they turn out delicate
hand-made Chinese ming trees for re-
sale at leading department stores and
have since turned to water colors on
cork and paper, beautifully framed to
enhance the art.

Mrs. Charles Mickle, better known
as Fran of “Fran’s Beauty Shop,” has
set up a display of the art in her shop
in the Pekin theater building, where the
infant business budded and bloomed
from a chance remark from a patron.
One of her customers had a “kit” con-
taining all the necessary materials for
a ming tree, which were said to be
“easily assembled.” The patron clipped
the ad and asked Fran if she knew any-
one who could put the tree together
according to instructions. Fran thought

454

of Mrs. Sherman Burdick, a former
commercial photographer with a nat-
ural talent for art, and that is when the
project got its start.

The first effort resulted in a beauti-
ful product—one which was on.display
for some time before the customer re-
turned to collect it. As a consequence,
other patrons saw it, and order after
order was handed to the two women.
The kits were soon discarded, however,
because they were too expensive and
because they limited the size of the
ming trees. From then on SUpplies were
bought in wholesale lots.

Word got around and soon the proj-
ects were on display at Jones Brothers’
jewelry store; and enough orders were
received to keep both women busy dur-
ing all their spare time. Next they
branched into the Block and Kuhl de-
partment stores which are scattered
over the northern and central parts of
the state.

The California concern that supplies
the materials was a bit slow in filling
orders, and these energetic workers
couldn’t stand the monotony of idle
time, so they turned to water-color
palntlng.

Clinging to the Oriental theme, they
turn out large portraits in vivid colors
of Chinese dances, all on sheets of cork
and appropriately framed and mounted.
Then there are their series of tribal

painted.

Even lamps are made from clay
molds in Oriental fashion and painted
by hand. Miniature Chinese figures add
to the collection and are favorites of
art connoisseurs.

The lone Chinese figurine placed be-
neath the ming tree has graduated on
occasions to full Chinese gardens, com-
plete with a variety of flowers, charac-
teristic bridges and as many as six
figures. These models sell for as much
as sixty dollars, with the simpler ming
trees on sale for as little as ten dollars.
All models are fair traded and sell for
the same price in each of the nineteen
stores handling them.

These novel handcraft products are
formed of bits of driftwood, bark,
lichen, moss, wire and plaster of Paris
and are enclosed in a bit of pottery;
they really have to be seen to be ap-
preciated.

During the past winter, the Pekin
and Recreation Board
handcrafts classes included figurine '!
painting, shellcraft, block printing,
leathercraft, cork craft, textile painting,
china painting, Flex Craft, Cryst-l-
craze painting and felt craft.

Community Recreation Series—IV I

the Business office

APP)“ is the community center di-
H rector whose work is also his rec-
reation; but even he must remember
the business of recreation and that
certain business-like procedures must
be observed even in so informal a place
as the average community center.

Somewhere in the building there
should be an office. If space is some-
what limited, it certainly cannot be the
biggest or most desirable room since
this must be set aside for the library,
small interest groups—such as the dra-
matics club, the music hour, the great
book program—or even as practice
rooms for the hillbilly band, swing-
sters, glee club, choral group and so on.

Of course, if the director is lucky
enough to have a building that has
more than enough large rooms, there’s
no reason why one‘ of these should not
serve as his oflice. Generally speak-
ing, however, the office doesn’t have
to be as large as most people think.

From the very beginning, everyone
who enters the center should under-
stand that while all the rest of the
building is at his disposal, the office
is not. This is a place of business, not
another lounge.

It’s natural for the group to want
to congregate in the spot where the
director is; for this very reason, he

plans his work so that he will not be in
his office during rush hours, except in
cases of absolute necessity. At such
timcs, he undoubtedly wants privacy,
perhaps for a phone call or an unex-
pected business appointment or con-
ference requiring no audience.

Occasionally one of the members

ship training specialist on the stat}t of
the National Recreation Association.

456

wants a word with the director—0r
vice versa—in private. The logical
place should be the office, but the in-

terview won’t be too successful if it is
constantly interrupted by passers-by

dropping in for a minute and remain-
ing until they are asked to leave.

Business people or interested citizens
who drop in to offer goods or services
or to make arrangements for the use
of certain rooms are favorably im-
pressed with a clean, well-organized,
business-like office. They also are im-
pressed with a clean, well-organiZed,
fice filled with empty coke bottles and
coffee cups, overflowing ashtrays,
candy and gum wrappers and with
hordes of people——-—the young ladies
perched upon the desk and the young
men with their hats upon their heads

and their feet upon the furniture—
cluttering up the office.

Sometimes the attraction in the office
is not the director, it’s the telephone.
This is a wonderful invention surely,
but at times such a problem that you
wish you could get along without it.
You can’t, of course; you need it for
business transactions and for emer-
gency calls. (Incidentally, know and
post any emergency numbers. We hope
you’ll never have to use them, but if
the occasion should arise, you don’t
want to have to take the time‘ to look
up the police, the fire department or
the nearest doctor in the phone book.)
Moreover, perhaps the assistant isn’t
as familiar as you might think with
all the business transactions which you
usually handle yourself. In your ab-
sence on the night of a big dance,
let’s say, when the lights go out, the
mike won’t work, the plumbing re-
neges, the band or refreshments fail
to appear, it will certainly help her

Mildred Scanlon

no end to be able to locate the correct
telephone numbers on the list.

An oflice phone is not like a per-
sonal phone. The line must be left
open for incoming business calls. Of
course, the community center’s popula-
tion can use the phone for little emer-
gencies. They will need to call home
occasionally about transportation or
change of plans. Their parents might
want to call them about much the
same things. These calls should be
approved by the director. He is simply
guarding against the long, drawn-out
boy-and girl calls or the girl-to-girl gab
fests that block the line.

With a business phone in the build-
ing, it’s necessary that someone be re-
sponsible for it during all the time
the center is Open. It might just hap-
pen that some parent must locate a
child in a hurry. If she knows he’s
at the center, calls and gets no answer
to the operator’s frantic ringing, she
has a right to be upset.

Here again is where the youth coun-
cil or junior leaders can come in
handy. They can have a regular
schedule and even, get some of their
school work done while they sit in the
quiet office listening for the phone.
Needless to say, these folks should ob-
serve the director’s rules about social
visits, food and so forth in the office.

Actually, it’s good business training
for them—particularly if you teach
them telephone courtesy and the cor-
rect method of answering and identify-
ing themselves. What’s more, it’s a
great step toward a more efficient and
smoother running center.

Recreation has assumed a profes-
sional status. Let’s have the recrea-
tion workers and their offices have
the same professional appearance and
approach found in other professions.

Summer’s Around the Corner

A new diving board and All-Ameri-

can Picnic Grill are among the prod-
ucts recently developed by the Ameri-
can Playground Device Company of
Anderson, Indiana.

The grill boasts perfect draft control
with its fully-enclosed fire bowl and its
six-way adjustable draft door, which
produces exactly the required tempera-
ture and heats all parts of the grids
evenly.

Not only does- the adjustable draft
improve the quality of the food, but it
also means a big saving in fuel, since
no heat is wasted in getting the grids
hot enough for use. There’s a massive
one-piece oven, two waffle-type top
grids and a one-piece removable grate.
Burning wood, coal or charcoal, the
grill provides a full 251/2-inch by 24-
inch grilling and warming area. The
ample space beneath the grid may be
used for baking or for warming foods.
The grill is mounted upon a tested steel
pipe support, so that by turning it to
leeward as the wind shifts, the cook
avoids getting a face full of smoke.

Both the portable and stationary
models are on the market. The portable
model, weighing 160 pounds and hav-
ing a base of heavy stove iron, may
easily be moved from one location to
another. The stationary model, de-
signed for installation in concrete,
weighs 140 pounds. In both cases, the
grill is readily removed from the sup-
port for easy storage.

The American official regulation div-
ing board is solid laminated, con-
structed exclusively of the t0p grades

° of clear, 100 per cent flat dense grain,

old growth Douglas fir, carefully se-
lected for moisture content and texture.
Each of the twelve laminated sections
comprising the board is surfaced,
planed and sanded to assure perfect

 

glue joints. The board is prime coated
and handsomely finished with two coats
of special Johnson’s Wax-O-Namel.

The American ofhcial regulation div-
ing board comes in lengths of twelve,
fourteen and sixteen feet. It is twenty
inches wide, three inches thick at the
base, tapers to a thickness of one and
one-half inches at the diving tip and
conforms fully to AAU official regula-
tions.

Luster Clay

A new, colored ceramic clay, with
unique properties which make it easy
for even beginners to create lifelike ar-
tificial flowers and many other decora-
tive ceramic pieces, has been placed on

the market by Luster Art Company,
Salt Lake City, Utah.

 

Luster Clay, the new product, re-
quires no firing or glazing and dries
with a hard lustrous finish within a few
hours. The clay is rolled and pressed
between the fingers into different shapes
and simply pressed onto the stems. The
flowers dry hard in a few hours and
are then ready for use.

The clay is sold in complete sets con-
taining leaves and stems for flowers
and five jars of clay in white, pink,
green, yellow and blue. A few other
permanent colors also are available and
may easily be blended to produce virtu-
ally any shade that may be desired.
Luster Clay is ready for modeling just
as it comes from the jar, requiring no
preparation.

PERSONNEL

Special Notice

The community recreation move-
ment, from a personnel point of View,
had just about recovered from the stag-
gering blow received from World War
II when the present emergency devel-
oped. The movement had lost many of
its best workers not only for the dura-
tion of the war but permanently. The
present situation is making it necessary
for us to extend and multiply our re-
cruiting efforts, and it is hoped that
professional workers and friends of rec-
reation in this country will be on the
alert to discover and direct new pros-
pects to the National Recreation Asso-
ciation’s personnel service.

In connection with the association’s
cooperative relationship with the armed
forces, we shall continue to keep their
needs in mind as we plan our recruit-
ing campaigns. Also, in accordance with
official requests, we shall do everything
possible to identify qualified recreation
personnel as they are drafted for mili-
tary service or called for other emer-
gency assignments.

Workers in the field could help dur-
ing the present emergency by letting
the association know when they, or
members of their staffs or associates,
are to be called for military duty. This
information is important for various
reasons. In the first place, it will help
us to assist the armed forces in Wash-
ington to find qualified recreation per-
sonnel. They, in turn, can assist in get-
ting recreation workers assigned to
their field of specialization. This pro-
cedure should be to the mutual advan-
tage of both military and professional
workers. In the second place, this ad-
vance information will help us to keep

over-all planning of our field service,
recruiting campaigns and training pro-
grams.
Positions Available

The armed services have an immedi-
ate need for about three hundred work-
ers to man the overseas clubs. These
vacancies, for the most part, call for
experienced women between the ages
of twenty-four and thirty-five. There
are a number of vacancies at the vari-
ous army headquarters in the conti-

nental United States. See the NRA
Playground and Recreation Bulletin

Service, November 1950, for listing.

Executives for small communities
continue to be in demand. A number
of recent graduates from our recreation
training schools have found such posi-
tions and are operating successfully.
( A few of these include Herbert
McMichael, appointed superinten-
dent of recreation in Burlington, New
Jersey; Donald MacMillan, apprentice,
Westchester County, New York; Clar-
ence Hunsinger, assistant superinten-
dent of recreation, Plainfield, New
Jersey; John T. McHugh, superinten-
dent of recreation for Montpelier, Ver-
mont; Robert"W. Ruhe, superintendent
of recreation in LaPorte, Indiana; and
James K. Williams, superintendent of
recreation in Keene, New Hampshire.)
There are many others, of course, who
went into staff positions in public de-
partments and private agencies.

Several positions are available in the
rural field and in connection with the
university training programs.

pital fiele Minnesota—employed ap-
proximately sixty recreation worker
in state mental hosPitals in recent
months; several vacancies for super-

Candidates who reside in other state
will be interviewed as soon as arrange-
ments can be made and as near their
homes as possible. Immediate employ-
ment is available in several mental in-
stitutions. (For further details see NRA
Bulletin Service, November 1950.)

It looks as if the demand in thi
specialized area would. increase, and
it is encouraging to note that som
training institutions are giving it mor
attention. The University of Minnesota
has set up a new recreation cu-rriculu
on the graduate level for the training
of recreation workers in hospitals. F.

recreation in York, Pennsylvania, will
soon sail for Europe for service with
the American Red Cross. Richard Stras-

Training
It is particularly encouraging to see
local departments providing new op-
portunities in the area of apprentice
training. The Westchester County Rec-
reation Commission has just taken on a
young apprentice, and the recreation

tax in view of the burden already car-
ried by real pr0perty. The possibilities
for new tax revenue and the principles
underlying the application of such a
tax, which he outlined, merit study.
“Merely to call attention to possibili-
ties, without recommending any specific
tax for this purpose, the following sug-
gestions have been made: ( 1) a local
cigarette tax, (2) a ten per cent admis-
sion tax equivalent to the amount to be
relinquished by the United States Gov-
ernment, if and when the federal rev-
eHUe measure is amended by Congres-
sional action. A computation indicates
that this would yield within the city of
Los Angeles about $3,987,000 per an-

num, taking into consideration a de-

 

department in Kansas City, Missouri,
has several opportunities available. This
training offers experience in the broad
field of public administration, with
particular attention to the administra-
tion of county and municipal recreation
services.

The Implementation Committee on
Graduate Study and the Executive
Committee on Undergraduate Training
have merged and are now known as
the Continuing Committee. This is an
outgrowth of two national conferences
held in Jackson’s Mill, West Virginia,
and Pere Marquette State Park in Illi-
nois on undergraduate and graduate
preparation in the fields of health edu-
cation, physical education and recrea-
tion.

The new committee will have as one
of its purposes the promotion of na-
tional, regional, state and local con-
ferences and worksh0ps in an effort to
improve training. The National Recre-
ation Association will serve on one of
the four subcommittees which have ust
been appointed.

the same time, it should be borne in

Suggestion

Filing RECREATION Magazine

SOMEWHERE, recently, we read about
an interesting and simple method
of magazine filing, for purposes of easy
reference, which will just suit some of
our RECREATION hoarders. Now that
the magazine is a new size, why not set
up your own system accordingly?

Clip the contents page from each
issue and paste on the right hand page
of a loose-leaf notebook, underlining
those articles to which you may wish to
refer later, and leave the left-hand
page blank for your own comments and
notes.

 

At the end of the year you’ll have a
notebook of ten pages on which your
pet ideas are clearly marked and easily
identifiable.

Pile a neat stack of the monthly
issues, in chronological order, upon
one of your shelves so that any given
number will be easily at hand. Then,
by turning to your notebook of con-
tents and running your finger down
the list, you quickly can locate that
helpful article at the moment when you
need it most. Simple, eh?

If any of you have further ideas for
simplified filing or indexing, please le

us know! '

Publicity Tips

No recreation department in Florida
or Georgia gets more newspaper pub-
licity than the Jacksonville department.
A staff member is assigned the respon-
sibility of preparing it and of keeping
in touch with the press. There is
scarcely an issue of a Jacksonville paper
that does not carry at least one article
on recreation.

Don’t forget to give your volunteers
publicity; let their names appear in the
papers, for people are always interested
in reading what local folks are doing;
it’s news .’ Learn to spell publicity with
those four letters N-E-W-S. Plan your
special events with someone on the pro-
gram who has news vaIUe in the com-
munity. Make that the lead of your re-
lease, going into the reason for the
event in the second or third paragraph.
Then it becomes the newspaper’s busi-
ness and pleasure to print the news of
your event.

Remember that a news story should
give the answers to the five “W’s” in
the lead of the story—who, what, where,
when and why. These should appear in
the first paragraph or in two short
paragraphs and are for the purpose of
producing a quick, clean and accurate
picture in the mind of the reader. Turn
to your own newspaper for illustrations
galore.

Valentine Preparations

Everybody likes to make valentines
—especially the younger children. So
why not have some pre-Valentine’s Day
parties or get-togethers for this pur-
pose? If a regular valentine party is in
the offing, decorations could be made
at the same time. During this activity,
lessons of friendship, unselfishness and
good will can be impressed upon the
children, without emphasis on the sen-
timental associations of the day. As a
matter of fact, the group might decide
to make extra valentines for hospital
patients, shut-ins or some similar group.
Scissors, paste and ideas can be used
for family fun too—all spread out on
the kitchen or dining-room table.

Many of the necessary supplies can
be collected at home—old valentines,
magazines, Christmas cards, funny pa-
pers and sample wallpaper books.
Otherwise scissors, paste, red card-
board, red and white crepe paper and
white paper doilies are needed. For
party decorations, inexpensive paper
drinking cups might be added. These
lend themselves to all kinds of covering

   
   
    
  
  
   
 
   
   
  
   
 
   
   
   
  
  

designs, which the children should
make up for themselves, and can be
used for nuts or candies. Twisted crep
paper handles can be added. Other pos-
sibilities are placemats, placecards,
crepe paper hats and a box covere
with crepe paper and attractive furbish
ings, to act as a mailbox for the futur
affair. Girls’ or women’s groups migh
like to try their hands at making heart
shaped cookies, biscuits or candies;
while sewing group
could contribut
heart-shaped pin
cushions, sachets.
These could be use
as favors or for hos
pital'patients. Scrap
books would be nice
too.

For the valentines themselves, in ad
dition to pretty lacy ones, don’t forge
the funny ones—but be sure that th
humor is impersonal. Cut-outs fro
the funny papers can be helpful here
but encourage originality. People fro
the nature study group, for instance.
will have good ideas about bird or ani-

mal valentines and, of course, everyon
will think of flowers.

 

Example of What NOT to Do

One recreation and playground pro-
gram has not been too successful be-
cause it did not come out of a desire
of the parents to provide a program for
their children, but was the project of a
club in making a record in a state and
national contest.

RECREATION I

 

 

IN THE FIELD

William M. Hay

RECENTLY appointed as representa-
tive for the National Recreation
Association in the southern district,
, soft-spoken, curly-haired Bill Hay from
Tennessee has an interesting back-
ground and an excellent record in as-
sociation state work to take to his new
assignment.

Bill is one of those likable, folksy
Southerners who is as sold on the South
as a Brooklynite is sold on the Dodgers.
He was raised in Memphis, except for
two never-to-be forgotten years in Fay-
etteville, Washington County, Arkansas,
' and has roamed the southern states
ever since. The years in F ayetteville
were filled with such boyhood delights
as camping and fishing on White River,
swimmin’ in Spring creeks, eXploring
caves and watermelon patches, attend-
. ing singins’, Spellin’ bees, box suppers
at the one-teacher school to which he
trekked three miles each day. At the
age of ten to twelve it was not all play,
however, for life on the farm in World
War I was one of production. Bill cared
for a one-acre garden, raised chickens,
hogs and owned his first horse. He
worked for neighbors in harvesting
crops, such as strawberries, apples,
potatoes and also helped with haymak-
ing, spraying and the pruning of
orchards. It was only natural for him
- to have an early desire to become a
farmer instead of a policeman or cow-
boy.

From these early experiences have
grown his hobbies. He likes the out-of-
doors—fishing and hunting, swimming
and horseback riding—and photogra-
phy. Cook-outs, camping and nature
study, like the others, are dear, but
there is little time to keep up with these
now.

While attending school in Memphis,
he worked at the printer’s trade prepara-
tory to a printing or ournalistic career.

lANUARY 1951

Upon graduation from Christian Broth-
ers College in Memphis, he continued
this activity and studied journalism at
night school until he had become a
journeyman printer; after which he
took a brief, but final, Hing at the
newspaper field. That yearning for the
out-of-doors, coupled with the depres-
sion, brought a drastic change in his

career.

Soon afterwards, on a two-hundred-
mile canoe trip down the Mississippi,
he reached a final realization that the
land, our natural resources and our
human resources are the most impor-
tant things we have and that to them he
wanted to devote his life’s work. Upon
deciding to travel to see the West, a job
—and an opportunity to get more for-
mal training—presented itself at Ft.
Worth, Texas. For two and a half
years thereafter he pursued studies in
landscape architecture at North Texas
Agriculture College, Arlington, and
Iowa State College, Ames.

With the coming of the civilian con-
servation program, Bill secured a job
as landscape foreman in the construc-
tion of state park areas in Tennessee.
However, the work programs were not
confined just to park construction, but
included general experience in reforest-
ation, erosion control conservation and
the development of our natural scenic
resources. As an extra-curricular activ-
ity, much time was spent with the en-
rollees in taking them on recreational
outings—teaching them on the job and
interesting them in nature. This as-
pect of the program brought real satis-
faction as these young men, like all
young Americans, were eager for ex-
pression—for recognition—to learn by
doing—to realize the joy of achieve-
ment.

At‘ the end of two years, an offer was
received from the state of Tennessee

 

for a position as recreation assistant in
the Division of Forestry of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture; this was in 1936.
The job was one of cooperation with
the National Park Service, USDA and
other federal oflicials in the develop-
ment of state parks and recreational
areas. It was the first job to be estab-
lished in the Tennessee state govern-
ment with recreation in its title.

Things were moving fast in Ten-
nessee because the great TVA move-
ment was now well under way. This
and the CCC program had created a
consciousness of conservation and rec-
reation. In early 1937, the legislature
created a new Department of Conserva-
tion, bringing together agencies con-
cerned with various aspects of conser-
vation but previously unrelated admin-
istratively. It included forestry, game
and fish, geology, advertising and in-
formation and a completely new Divi-
sion of State Parks.

All recreational and park activities
were transferred to the new Division of
State Parks, and Bill was given an op-
portunity to take a hand in formulating
the policies and objectives. A new title,
one of those which means anything and
includes everything, was acquired.
“Land-Use Planner,” according to Bill,
“meant, in more simple words, General
Flunkie.” However, it allowed great
latitude not only in the specific activity
of state parks, but to recreation in the
state generally. In 1937, as a result of
much leg work, the Tennessee Recrea-
tion Association was created. Here all
recreational interests came together—
college presidents, chambers of com-
merce, city recreation people, rural and
social agencies. Much activity was the
result, growing until the war made it
impossible. In 1937 the Park, Parkway
and Recreation Area Study, sponsored
by the National Park Service, was in-

461

itiated in Tennessee, and Bill was as-
signed to this comprehensive study.

In 1939 he assumed the duties of
director of the Division of State Parks;
and, during the ensuing years, received
much help and inspiration from such
stalwarts as J. B. Williams, first state
representative of the National Recrea-
tion Association, Connie Wirtli, Steamer
Bursley and Al Edmunds of the Na-
tional Park Service. Tennessee park
management moved forward. In 1942,
through a cooperative agreement with
the TVA, a full-time recreation con-
sultant to serve towns and counties was
employed, and one of the first services
of its kind initiated in the country. Be-
cause of the rapid increase in camping
in seven state park group camps, the
need for good camp leaders had been
realized for several years; finally, in

1945, a two weeks’ training program
was conducted for camp directors and
counselors.

During the war, a program was di-
rected by the division, through Lanham
Act Funds, to provide recreation and
service to soldiers on maneuvers, in
twenty-three towns of middle Tennes-
sec.

Bill Hay is a member of the Ameri-
can Institute of Park Executives, Na-
tional Conference on State Parks and
one of the originators of the Associa-
tion of Southeastern State Park Di-
rectors.

He has experienced the struggle to
get funds for an important, but new,
state service, and has pleaded with leg-
islators for help and needed legislation.
The job of selling parks and recreation
to the public in general has been a real

one and a constant challenge. It was
the realization of the problems of state
officials, a knowledge of their sincerity
and desire to do a good job and a sym-
pathy and understanding for their prob-
lems and their accomplishments that
helped Bill in working closely with
them in his state work. He says, “It
would have been impossible for me to
work with state officials without having
had these similar experiences. Being a
state official is like giving birth to trip-
lets—no one knows what you go
through unless he has had the actual
experience.

“I shall continue to work with them,
wherever possible, in the further ad-
vancement of recreation in this region.”

A closer cooperation with state of-
ficials is part of the district representa-
tive’s job; so more power to you, Bill!

. . . THAT in the preliminary preparations of the Texas
Committee for Children and Youth for the White House
Conference, questionnaires were sent to all counties in the
state requesting a statement of needs for children and
youth. The priority of needs as listed by 104 counties re-
plying were as follows:

Recreation 94 counties
Library Service 90 counties
Health 89 counties
Education 83 counties

Child Care and Protection 77 counties

Handicapped 70 counties
Housing 70 counties
Employment 35 counties

. .- . THAT as a result of the notice printed in the October
1949 issue of RECREATION, in which readers were asked to
send their used copies to United States Information Li-
braries in foreign countries, the Department of State re-
ports:

a. Almost all countries reported an in-flow of publica-
tions within one to two months after the first notice appeared.

b. Readers send not only RECREATION, but other pub-
lications in the same package. We consider this an im-
portant addition to the campaign and feel that it should
be encouraged. .

c. The mailing of your particular magazine seems to
lack continuity. The reader will send one copy and then
stop in future months, as indicated by the gradual dr0p-
ping off of receipts in our foreign libraries.

The Department of State also notes that “magazines
from the United States seem to be the most important un-
official ‘Voice of America’ that our offices can possibly ex-
pose to foreign populations. We hope, therefore, that you
will make it possible for us to continue the steady flow of
this valuable propaganda material.”

The Dorothy C. Enderis Playground is a 9.7 acre tract
in one of the newer neighborhoods in Milwaukee. It boasts
a fully-developed area with a field-house that has facilities
for club meetings, crafts, cooking and out-of-door dra-
matics. The hardball and softball diamonds, as well as the
tennis courts, have lighting for night use and are completely
surfaced. Part of the area is grass and has a park-like ap-
pearance to suit the residential neighborhood.

Square Dances of Today and
How to Teach and Call Them

Richard Kraus. A. S. Barnes and Com-
pany, New York. $3.00.

D ICK KRAUS, who is in charge of the

square dance program at Teachers
College, Columbia University, and
teaches courses in folk, square, social
and children’s dances there, has led
square dance groups in many parts of
theacountry. He is also chairman of
New York State’s Westchester County
Square Dance Association, and has
been on the staff of Folk Festivals for
the United Nations. With this back-
ground, he is in a position to know
what he’s talking about in this all-
around manual for square dance callers
and teachers—both those in the field
and those who would like to enter it.
Its how-to-do text is designed to help
anyone organize and conduct a square
dance program; and it offers new dance
and instructional material to broaden
the program of experienced dancers.
The dances included are drawn from all
parts of the country, a number of them
being presented for the first timeqin
book form; while the piano arrange-
ments have been prepared with two
ideas in mind: first, to preserve the
folk character of the dances and,
second, to keep the level of diHiculty
within the ability of the nonprofes-
sional pianist. An article by Dick Kraus
—“One World On Your Playground”
—appeared in the April 1949 issue of
RECREATION.

new Publications

Covering the

Leisure-time Field

ment of a program in gerontology—in
which courses, institutes or conferences,
research and publications are involved.
This is a joint experiment of the Uni-
versity’s Institute for Human Adjust-
ment and the extension service.
Assuming that those who have grown
old know best the nature of the impact
of that experience, the institute turned
to the older people themselves in pre-

paring an entire book, Living Through

the Older Years, edited by Clark Tib-
bitts and published by the Michigan
University Press in 1949.

The present book has been planned
as a companion volume, its chapters

being organized around three of the
need areas which the older folks

brought forth—living arrangements,
recreational activities and employment.

Papers on these topics are presented
by such authorities as: Nathan W.
Shock, chief of the Cardiovascular
Disease and Gerontology Section of the
National Institutes of Health in the
Public Health Service; Ollie A. Ran-
dall, consultant on services for the aged
to the Community Service Society, New
York City; Henry S. Curtis, Ph.D., lec-
turer, author and leader in the area of
recreation and one of the founders of
the Playground Association of America
—now the National Recreation Associa-
tion; Helen Graves Lane, assistant di-
rector of the Chicago Community Proj-
ect for the Aged; and others.

Here is excellent background reading
for those who are conducting or plan-
ning recreation programs for this age

group.

Municipal Auditoriums

Farrell G. H. Symons. Public Adminis-
tration Service, Chicago. $2.50.

HIS PUBLICATION meets a long-felt
Tneed for up-to-date information on
municipal auditorium management, op-
eration, construction and costs. The ob-
ject of Mr. Symons’ survey was to

assemble factual data about the con-
struction, management and operation
of civic auditoriums throughout the
country, and to present a" discussion
of some of the questions which these
structures commonly involve.

The volume was prepared principally
from responses submitted by 174 local-
ities to questionnaires which included
twenty—four specific questions and in-
vited comments and suggestions from
the various cities, based upon their ex-
perience. The oflicials supplying the
information were most frequently, in
the larger cities, the auditorium manag-
ers or the heads of departments con-
trolling the auditorium; in the smaller
cities, the mayor, city clerk or city man-
ager mest often responded.

The following titles from the table
of contents indicate the specific nature
of the data presented: Physical Aspects
of Auditoriums, Management and Con-
trol, Financial Problems, Rental Sched-
ules, Types, Facilities and Uses. Many
statistics are presented for each of the
auditoriums included in the study.

In the summary and conclusions, Mr.
Symons states that the information as-
sembled warrants the belief that audi-
toriums, by and large, have proved
worthwhile undertakings for municipal
governments. They can scarcely be re-
garded as important sources of revenue
but they can meet definite community
needs which, in many cases, could be
satisfied by no other existing means.

One of the most useful sections of
the report is the discussion of the fac-
tors which should be considered by F
a community contemplating the con- ‘
struction of a municipal auditorium.
Municipal Auditoriums should prove
of great assistance to cities now weigh-
ing the pros and cons of erecting audi-
toriums, as well as to those which al-
ready have such buildings—George D.
Butler, Director of Research, National
Recreation Association.

“Bond saving enabled me to become a home

car with a new one.”

  
    
  
 

“I enrolled in the Payroll Savings Plan
before the war at the Stearns-Roger
Manufacturing Co. I was buying two
$18.75 bonds a month toward a dream
home Lila and I had planned.”

“The $4,000 we’ve saved paid $2,800
on our first home, paid the difference
when we traded this house for a new
brick one, and paid $500 on our car.
Bonds will send our girls to college, too!”
