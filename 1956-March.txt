junior recreation leaders; a creative playshop; an
improvised play community; playground dragon-
making; and many others. Of especial interest to
administrators, athletic coaches, and leaders will be
an excellent article, “The Conditioning and Main-
tenance of Baseball Diamonds,” presenting the in-
structions and suggestions of a number of experi-
enced park people. The material was compiled by
C. 0. Brown, president of the American Amateur
Baseball Congress. This issue will also carry a con-
tinuation of “Swimming Pool Operation and Main-
tenance,” which appears on page 128 in this issue.

Challenging Forecast

Sirs:

I read Mr. Prendergast’s January edi-
torial, “The Past is Prologue to the Fu-
ture,” with great interest. The history
is challenging. Such forecasts impress
each of us in the field with the impor-
tance of building a good groundwork
now.

You’ll be interested in this clipping
from our paper last night.

CHASE H. HAMMOND, Director, De-
partment of Parks and Recreation,
M ushcgon, Michigan.

0 Quote from the clipping enclosed:

“Ann Arbor, January 19, l956—A 30-
hour week has been suggested by
Governor Williams as a partial solu-
tion to problems expected to result
from automation.

“Williams told the Michigan Paritors
Conference that automation in Mich-
iaan automotive factories in the next
10 years may result in 100,000 work-

ers doinn the work of the present 500,-
000."—-Ed.

Our Foundations

Sirs:

The article entitled “Firming the
Foundations” [February] is a honey.
Before I had read it. one of our center

directors asked me if I had. That added

to its interest.
I am going to keep this in front of me
from now on. It is so true that it hurts.

It is almost as if you were writing about
Charleston.

There is nothing more to say but
thank you—we shall do our best to im-

prove our playgrounds and after-school
grade school program.

ROHERT E. KRESGE, Superintendent
of Recreation, Park and Recreation

Commission, Charleston, West Vir-
gtnia.

Let’s Standardize Our Names

Sirs:
At our most recent state assoc1ation
I o “ o 0
meeting, we discussed What is in a

.name?” with the focus on names for

recreation areas. While the discussion
was in progress, the following idea came
to me. It has probably been discussed
many times by many others but, if so,
I am ignorant of it.

Throughout the country, recreation
leaders are lamenting loudly that the
layman does not understand the total
scope of recreation, that he thinks only
in terms of summer playgrounds or
athletics; while, in reality, the various
departments are encompassing all fields
from nature to cooking. (The depart-
ment will admit that it isn’t too inter-
ested in who receives the credit; but, at
the same time, it understands that a
better program means a greater chance
for more finances to operate a still
better program.) However, is it the
layman who is at fault in the lack of
understanding? Possibly, but is it not
more probable that the recreation peo-
ple are at fault—especially the profes-
sional ones?

We, as professional people, still talk
in terms that include centers of all types,
tot lots, neighborhood areas, play-
grounds, beaches, parks, and so on.
How often have you attended a meeting
and spent much time difiering on termi-
nology rather than practices?

Would it not be better if we strove to
obtain a trademark on the title “Public
Recreation,” so that it would mean the
same thing to all people? Then each
phase would be a part of the total public
recreation program. All outside facili-
ties would be titled “areas” with indoor
facilities being. “centers.” For example,
it would no longer be the New York
Twelfth Street Tot Lot, but rather the
Twelfth Street Recreation Area. Like-
wise, a handcraft session in Garfield
Center would be a handcraft class in the
Garfield Recreation Center.

RECREATION

 

The schools did this long ago, so that
today everyone knows, in general, what
is meant by a geography class in Chi-
cago’s public schools.

It may sound odd to us now, but in
a very short time it should not only
eliminate our own confusion but also
that of the layman.

Please see below for an idea of how it
would look in a newspaper:

Old way—Cadet baseball at State
Street Ballpark; swimming lessons at.
Lincoln Beach; handcraft at Higley
Field; dancing at Garfield gym; music
at Volworth Bowl.

New way —— Cadet baseball at State
Street Recreation Area; swimming les-
sons at Lincoln Recreation Area; hand-
craft at Higley Recreation Area; danc-
ing at Garfield Recreation Center; mu-
sic at Volworth Recreation Area.

CHARLES H. ODEGAARD, Director,

Parks and Recreation Department,
Marinette, Wisconsin.

Personnel Practices
Sirs:

The article “How Are You Doing on
Personnel Administration?” [Febru-
ary, 1956] is excellent. It points out
clearly the problem which faces so many
of us and indicates a method of solving
it. This very serious personnel prob-
lem is that it is diflicult to obtain ade-
quate and experienced persons, either
on a part-time or full-time basis. °

The article is brief and to the point
and I assume that a great deal has been
omitted by necessity. However, I
should like to comment on some speci-
fic aspects of the problem which seem
to warrant considerable attention.

Writing job descriptions for recrea-
tion positions is not an easy task. Great
care must be exercised in being suf-
ficiently specific to obtain the right per-
son. We must be careful to specify a
man or woman, if the position requires
one or the other; t0"indicate whether we
need an athlete, craft specialist, or a per-

SChools of physical education and
recreation are natural contacts. How-
ever, we often overlook the possibility
of obtaining very competent people
through colleges which train young peo-
ple for .teaching in the elementary edu-

who have majors in recreation are still
not available in numbers sufficient to
meet our needs.

Salary schedules are extremely im-

Graduate Education

Sirs:

There is much to agree with, and. lit-
tle with which to take issue, in Dr.
Hutchinson’s “Purpose of Graduate
Education for Recreation,” appearing
in this issue.* Of the five purposes he
lists, I fully agree that three of them—~—
the conduct of research; development
of scholarly leaders; and specialization
in a particular area—-—are indeed basic
to graduate programs in recreation. The
other two purposes—-—to apply research,
and to develop the ability to communi-
cate—must also be listed among the
foundational purposes of undergradu-
ate work.

The purposes of graduate work must
be viewed in terms of the needs of the
field and of society in general. This
means that, although the level of ad-
mission practices must be kept high,
certain of the emphases in graduate
work should be altered from time to
time to meet identifiable needs as they

appear.

Outcomes as well as purposes of
graduate work must also be given atten-
tion. In my opinion one of the impor-
tant outcomes is raising the prestige of
recreation, and in this connection 'I
look forward to the day when many of
our recreation executives will possess
the doctor’s degree and thus match or
exceed the educational qualifications of
the chief'school official of the city.

DR. GERALD B. FITZGERALD, Director
of Recreation Training, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

Sirs:

I agree with Dr. Hutchinson that the
need for more and better research in
our area of work is very great indeed.
However, I do not believe that the
preparation of “mature, highly-selected
scholars” to conduct research deserves
first place in any listing of the major
purposes of graduate education for rec—
reation, at the present time, because it
is wholly unrealistic. It is unrealistic
primarily for these reasons:

'1. Colleges are in no position to be

cerned, at the present stage of the de-
velopment of recreation in this nation.
I wish, in all sincerity, that we might
indulge in this luxury of selectivity now,
but our problem, at least in the South,
is one of recruitment rather than one of
rejection—which the word “selection”
implies. It might also be good for our
souls, though deflating to our egos, to
admit that very few mature, highly-
selected scholars, at present, are choos-
ing recreation as their life’s work.

2. Recreation personnel must eat and
job opportunities for the research spe—
cialist are almost non-existent at the
present time.

3. Graduate education in recreation
has a more important function to per-
form just now than the preparation of
research specialists.

The most imperative purpose of grad-
uate education, it seems to me, is to
produce master leaders, supervisors,
and administrators who will become
social engineers concerned with far
broader aspects of community life than
is true generally at this time.

representatives, has retired from
full-time active work for the Asso-
ciation.

In a very real sense, J. W.’s personal and professional
career has been an adventure in the art of living. He has
long had a “yen” to discover elements that make people’s
lives click. A personal life of rich and satisfying experience
has equipped him to help others find the ingredients.

His early professional years, spent in social casework
medicine, in individual and family relief practices, and in
Red Cross and federal agency programs for the care of serv-
icemen’s families, provided abundant knowledge of people’s
daily struggle to live—the art of existing. In the process he
discovered, as he himself explains, that families above and
beyond the dependency state kept returning for advice and
counsel with problems, rather than for material relief.

In the field of community recreation, he saw the opportu-
nity and felt the challenge to help people get a plus in living

-———a “must” that material salvage did not supply. He brought“

to this new undertaking important personal leisure-time as-
sets. A graduate of the Schenectady Conservatory of Music
and a professional singer in choral and oratorio groups, he

championed this and other cultural phases in local recrea-
tion programs.

He is the father of four girls and two boys, now all grown
and married. He knows the fun of family life and associa-
tions. He is the recognized authority on family recreation
among members of the NRA staff. Scores of communities
and national organizations have sought his counsel on this
highly important subject. From his rich family experience
has come also his great understanding of and faith in young
people. He possesses a rare and happy blend of youth’s de-
sire for change and for the cherished past of seniors.

His is a life fortified by many friendships—people in his
church, in school and community life, as well as among his
professional associates. The latter are his second family—~—
a group which he always speaks of 'with great affection. His
warmth of spirit, good humor, and faith in people reflect an
enviable capacity for liking what life brings.

The files of the National Recreation Association contain
scores of letters from the many communities and individuals
with whom he has worked, telling how his knowledge and
experience has helped them solve their recreation problems.

J. W. would be the first to tell us that he has not yet learned
the secret of making his every day a rich and victorious ex-
perience. Nevertheless, those of us who have had the good
fortune to work with him during his thirty-three years as
a member of the National Recreation Association staff know
more about the fine art of mastering life because of our as-

sociation with him.——~—CHARLES E. REED, Director, Field

Editorial

Inspired Leadership

 

m-’

EVERY GROUP has leadership of some quality—good, bad,

or indifferent. Great leadership, however, possesses a
quality which can best be expressed by the use of the adjec-
tive “inspired.” Inspired leadership breathes a spiritual
virus of initiative and quality into group life. The concept
of this type of leadership can be defined thus:

Inspired leadership facilitates the contagious commun-
ication of competent enthusiasms in situations of heartfelt
concern, mutual enjoyment, and personal growth. By dis-
covering, releasing, developing, and putting to work the
varied competencies of peeple, inspired leadership oper-
ates to define and to achieve group goals through the in-
volvement and participation of peeple. By helping peOple
to feel free and be responsible, inspired leadership widens
the base of initiative conducive to progressive growth and
achievement. It encourages each person at the point of
his own performance to think his best, speak his best, do
his best, and be his best. InSpired leadership Works to
build a group culture which is responsive to positive
change and which generates within itself the resources of
continuing imagination, increasing knowledge, and de-
veloping skills. '

This definition requires discussion and application.

Competent Enthusiasm

The energy and idea input of any group or organizational
unit flows through the communication of an enthusiasm.
The enthusiasms which propel an organization are of two
kinds: (1) the inflow of new, creative ideas which keep the
organization growing, vital, and useful; and (2) the defini-
tion and acceptance of common goals and tasks by which the
members of the organization seek to perform their operat-
ing assignmentsby work and teamwork.

An enthusiasm is really a buoyant and emotionally ad-
vanced belief in the desirability of some good to be achieved
by appropriate action. The good may be new or it may relate
to one’s own immediate, prosaic task. The communication
of these enthusiasms makes possible the oneness of purpose
which brings the efforts of people to focus in an organization.

Consider for a moment the inflow of a new enthusiasm.
Groups move forward under the prOpulsion of new ideas.
These ideas seem to “sprout up” inside people. The vitality
of an Organization stems from its response to novelty. Each
man seems to have his own sphere of concern. Vinobha
Bhave, Gandhi’s walking disciple, for example, seeks by

“land gift sacrifices” to obtain donations of land from'
India’s wealthy landowners and to distribute the plots to the
Asian nation’s landless poor. Two Ohio entomologists direct
their scientific skills to the development of a kind of corn
plant which is immune to the attack of borers. In the early
years of this century Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., was fired with an
enthusiasm for motor cars. He built his life into the Gen-
eral Motors Corporation. Conrad Hilton believes in hotels.
Back in 1948, Harold F .,Smiddy joined the staff of the Gen-
eral Electric Company. He was fired with the idea that
leadership and management are subjects which can be taught
and learned and that the existence and growth of a great
corporation depends upon doing both. L. H. Weir believed
in public parks for the use of peeple and he devoted his life
to showing what he meant by his enthusiasm. ”
Because pe0ple differ in their life backgrounds and life
interests, they have different enthusiasms and competencies.
As Herbert Thelen says: “Without the differences among
individual personalities there would berno basis for the
creation of new and better solutions to the problems of
living.”*' , , I v a ,
Inspired leadership encourages the development of the
best enthusiasms from the most people—and it expects these
enthusiasms to be competent. A graduate student once asked
President James B. Conant at Harvard University what he
felt to be the first requisite of a competent chemist. “The
first requisite of a good chemist,” replied Conant, “is the
ability to pick out the right problem on which to work.” A
competent enthusiasm must ,reckon with the, limiting factors
of reality which the discipline chooses.‘ A wild, unprocessed
enthusiasm frustrates and annoys people. Inspired leader-
ship assumes the obligation of keeping the dynamic and cre-
ative channels of expression open—and keeping the produc-
tion competent at the same time. F
Competent enthusiasms do not sprout in the void. The
cultivation of competent enthusiasms requires (1) sound
preparation, (2) accurate performance, and (3) continuing
professional growth. When he was, asked how to build a
good orchestra, Paul Whiteman cited King’s Band: for every
hour on the job, the players practiced six. Back in 1895,
Wilbur and Orville Wright read about the gliding experi-
ments of Otto Lilienthal near Berlin. The idea of, gliding
through the air appealed to them as sport. By 1899 the two
brothers were engaged in serious reading about flying. Over
a period of ten years they exchanged letters with Octave
Chanute, the engineer who had built the Kansas City Bridge

of Chicago Press, 5750 Ellis Avenue. Chicago 37. 1954. Pp. 379. $6.00.

and the Chicago Stockyards; he had directed gliding experi-
ments. The two brothers identified problems which other
air-minded thinkers had faced. They studied their points
of success and failure. In 1909, Wilbur and Orville organ-
ized the Wright Company for the manufacture of airplanes,
opened a flying school, and on May 25, 1910, took their
father, an eighty-two-year-old bishop in the United Brethren
Church, for his first airplane ride. ‘

The Adjective “Competent”

The process of refining an enthusiasm into a “competent
enthusiasm” requires qualified and strenuous application.
In the development of their enthusiasm, the Wrights bound
together sound preparation, accurate performance, and con-
tinuing growth. Since their day, preparation, performance,
and growth have taken on new dimensions: the principle,
however, that sustained and critical effort are necessary to
refine an enthusiasm into a workable and competent en-
thusiasm remains.

Why a particular enthusiasm appeals to a particular per-
son still remains an inscrutable area of human experience.
It can only be said that those who lead grasp meaningful
relationships and forge them into patterns of action ade-
quate to achieve a goal. Competent enthusiasms “evolve”
through a process of exploration, clarification, preparation,
incubation, illumination, and verification. A leader .must
face a difficult problem. He must think deliberately and in-
tensively about it. His formal thinking must have failed to
solve the problem. Sometime when his mind is relaxed and
unwearied, illumination comes to him.

Illumination can be cultivated. The methods for the de-
velopment and communication of competent enthusiasms

can be applied.
Literary Skills

The cultivation of competent enthusiasms also makes a
strenuous demand for current literacy. A leader must know
the developments in his own field and in the world as events
~ relate to his field. The leader stands on advancing frontiers.
He reads. He observes. He listens. He discusses. He is
active in professional societies. He explores. He keeps the
channels of communication open. Fortunately, the com-
munication skills—the abilities to read, write, speak, listen,
think, and participate—can be, are being, and must be de-
veloped with study and practice. Throughout their lives,
outstanding inspired leaders characteristically continue to
deve10p and to perfect them.

The importance of these communication skills to the art
of leadership is emphasized by Harold F. Smiddy when he
points out the necessity of just “plain and simple listening.”
“We can,” he says, “only hear if we just listen.”

Inspired leadership demands the sharpening of the com-
munication skills. Leadership in any organization, of course,
has as its purpose the obligation to accomplish work effi-
ciently through the efforts of people. Since good work is per-
formed by good people, the leader must accept the task of
helping people to grow to perform better work. Hence the
task of developing an efficient morale is performed in the
process of communication by which people understand and

104

accept policies and assignments. The explanation of a policy
is really the extended communication of a competent task

enthusiasm to a performance level.
Society exists in communication. By the sharing of ideas

and the exchange of differential eXperiences, people come to
understand and put competent enthusiasms to work. The
great art of the inspired leader is to facilitate the flow of
ideas and information into the group and to circulate and
refine the ideas into action. The verb “facilitate” has a spe-
cial meaning in this context. The role of the leader is to
make the process of communication easy or less difficult. A
leader can never take the part of communication for granted.

In the past it has become customary to refer to communi-
cation as a “one-way” or a “ two-way” process. Now a new
concept is emerging: communication flows in all directions.
Good communication permeates, brings about understand-
ing and acceptance of common goals of all the p60ple con-
cerned with an operation.

Q

Effective Communication

The effectiveness of communication depends upon (1) the
clearness of the concept (enthusiasm) in the mind, (2) the
simplicity and accuracy of the language by which the con-
cept is explained, (3) the diplomacy used in presentation,
(4) the understanding and acceptance of the idea by the
group, and (5) the culture of the group as it is accustomed
to respond to new ideas.

Enthusiasms must be communicated with a concern for
the person to whom they are communicated. Since feelings
are facts, words produce emotional reactions. These reac-
tions may be positive or negative; they may help or hinder
communication. Inspired leadership seeks to use language
in such a way as to help—not antagonize. Hence diplomacy
in presentation to a large extent determines the reaction in
acceptance.

True leadership, according to Mr. Smiddy, “is found in
'attaining accomplishment of common purposes by partici-
pation and persuasion rather than by command.”

Using Conflict

Mary Parker Follett pointed out that since men cannot
avoid conflict, they should use it. When two desires have been
integrated, a solution deve10ps which finds a place for the
best in both. Settlement of conflict by domination gives a
victory to one side. compromise means giving up some-
thing, but integration develops a new strength out of previ-
ous divergencies.

The end product of inspired leadership lies in a quality
of culture characteristic of a healthy group—friendly, co-
operative, dynamic, and productive. Participation in work
and teamwork in such a climate produces role satisfaction
through creative involvement, participation, and skill mas-
tery. The working group becomes a responsive, living,
adaptable, dynamic unit deve10ping and pursuing common
goals with superlative craftsmanship. By the openness of
its channel of communication to the inflow, circulation, and
refinement of enthusiasms it is responsive to change and
growth. Within itself it generates resources of continuing
imagination, increasing knowledge, developing skills. I

AUTOMATION

. . . A Challenge to Recreation

 

FRANK THOMPSON, a tool-and-die maker, worked his usual
thirty-five hours last week at the factory. Wednesday
night he attended the weekly meeting of the City Improve-
ment League at the community center; a course in oil paint-
ing at the high school with his wife occupied Friday evening.
Frank doesn’t have to be a conjured-up character. A life
like his may eventually be a common one as a result of an
economic change in our way of living. This change is called
“automation.” Simply stated, automation is the greater
mechanization of the world of work. With machinery ac-
complishing a higher standard of performance, resulting in
greater per capita productivity, man will have the opportu-
nity truly to demonstrate that we do not have to live by
bread alone. With increased time at his disposal, he can
give more hours to his off-the-job life. How he spends those
hours becomes the crux of our concern.

Much stress has been traditionally placed in our culture
upon the virtues of long and hard work-life. With automa—
tion shortening the labor day for masses of our population,
this concept will have to be displaced by stress upon the
positive values of leisure time to prevent a vacuum of un-
rest and untapped potentials. Properly motivated and di-
rected, man will have time to develop his innate capacities
and interests. By way of illustration, because Frank Thomp-
son wasn’t primarily concerned with recuperation from his
workday when he returned home Wednesday and Friday
. afternoons, he could devote time to the enjoyment of his
own personal interests without sacrificing time from being
with his family or satisfactory performance on his job.

The absence of the father from the home, while'satisfying
its economic needs, has often deprived the family group of
much of its unity and stability. The growing tendency of
the mother to leave home for the same purpose has intensi-
fied the problem. The advent of automation could help
assure the securing of necessary goods and services in a
shorter period of time, relieving the parents to assume their
much needed roles as leaders of their family units. Recrea-
tion-wise, planners may have to become more interested in
family recreation programs. Such programs may well in-
clude not only various types of activities but may also pro-

 

MR. DUT’I‘ON, currently executive secretary of a boys’ club
in Kearny, New Jersey, has worked widely with boys’ clubs
and settlements, holds a degree in economics from. the Uni-
versity of California, and has done graduate work at the

New York School of Social W orlc.
106

vide discussion group opportunities where family problems
can be shared and perhaps worked out through with the
help of a trained leader.

Certain experts seem to agree that automation will con-
tribute in the long run toward greater economic stability,
despite possible temporary technological unemployment.
They base their prognostications upon the thesis that auto-
mation will require total economic planning. Rather than
permanent mass unemployment, shifts in jobs and the open-
ing of new work frontiers may eventually develop. The re-
sult could be the creation of a sturdier sbcial milieu, un-
daunted by fears of depressions and unemployment. The
psychological effects upon the family cannot be underesti-
mated should this theory become a realized fact. Recreation
could assume its rightful role as a catalytic agent to help
develop and release innate personal and social capacities,
rather than so frequently having to be hardened with “keep-
ing the lid” on tensions and conflicts resulting from extreme
social and economic inadequacies.

Another interesting change possible in future off-the-job/
living can be illustrated by Frank. In the past, civic and
welfare responsibilities have been taken on largely by the
white collar and professional worker. People in other labor-
ing categories, for the most part, have had neither time nor
energy to pursue activities involving social signifidance.
Automation can release a new resource of human leader-
ship. It behooves our civic leaders to recognize this fact and
to recruit, train, and welcome these people. Contributing
toward community growth and development can also‘ con-
tribute toward personal feelings of dignity and worth. Con-
sequently, a general upgrading of society can result, and
automation becomes an enhancer of the democratic process.
Community centers may not only serve to house the in-
creased number of civic-minded groups, but professional
staff members may be able to assist civic leaders in their
formation and operation. Their trained skills in group
dynamics and development should prove invaluable.

Upgrading can also occur as a result of automation’s need
for more highly trained and educated personnel. Some
experts assert that, just as mass production moved large
segments of our unskilled working population into a semi-
skilled class, automation will transfer many of these work-
ers into a more skilled category. The routine, repetitive
functions of assembly line work will give way to electrical
and mechanical repair Work, instrument adjustment, pro-
duction planning, designing, and engineering. Contrary to

. RECREATION

popular belief, man will control the machine, rather than
the reverse; his capacities to think, to analyze, to synthesize,
and to act meaningfully. will be demanded to an unprece-
dented degree. These abilities must be largely developed by
our educational institutions; and, with increased education,
a broadening of intellectual horizons often occurs. It is pos-
sible that avocational interests may move to some degree
from the more passive variety to a desire for more creative
expression. This more creative use of man’s abilities may
have dramatic implications for recreation. Thus, it will
have become acceptable for Frank Thompson to enroll in an
oil painting class without fear of social castigation from his
male peer group. Perhaps man will discover for himself a
,more wholesome balance between his needs as a social ani-
mal and his needs as an individual.

As automation shortens the working week, more indi-
viduals can move into groups involving social interaction
outside the ob and home. On the job, managers possessing
skills in interpersonal relations will be as indispensable as
ever. Thus, because of new adjustment demands and be-
cause machines will make us an increasingly inter-depen-
dent society, social skills will continue to be challenged and

needed. Our institutions, such as the school, church, and‘

recreation center, must provide leadership in this area. A
professionally planned program of recreation should be
concerned with processes which stimulate and inspire quali-
ties of respect for the self and others, a balanced desire to

 

others, and an acceptance of human differences. These
values can be greatly attained by social group work pro-
grams based upon interest and friendship, discussion
groups, dances and parties, and by civic action bodies such
as the one to which Frank Thompson belongs. They will
manifest themselves on the job in the shape of a secure and
satisfied worker who will perform on a higher and more
productive level than one having difficulty relating to his
co-workers and adjusting to himself. Thus, management
and labor both benefit.

The claims made for automation in this article may sound
exaggerated. But to define more precisely the problems in-
volved, automation and recreation have been maintained as
the dependent variables. Other factors, such as international
tensions, demographic variations, and social and technical
innovations have been assumed more or less constant for
purposes of analysis. It is granted that automation will not
occur overnight. This fact is a blessing, however, for it
affords us time to plan now for its arrival.

One authority in the field of automation has asked: “Are
we capable of developing a culture that does not depend
upon work to give meaning to our lives?” In addition, can
we learn to utilize leisure time as something more than a re-
covery period from work? Automation cannot be criticized
for creating these problems; they have been gradually de-
veloping, and automation will simply accentuate them. Their
solutions will provide the real challenge to the field of

give as well as to take, an ability to work cooperatively with

recreation! I

N on-Working Time Continues to Expand

In the year of 1800, the average work
week consisted of eighty-four hours. In
1900, it averaged sixty hours; in 1925,
'fifty hours; and in 1950, forty hours.
In view of the increasing development
and practical utilization of automatical—
ly controlled machines, it is now con-
sidered reasonable to believe that the
average work week in 1975 will not ex-
ceed thirty-tWo hours.

More working people are now taking
more frequent and longer vacations
each year. In 1940, for example, only
a quarter of all labor contracts provided
for paid vacations. By 1944-, four-fifths
of the workers in the United States, ex-
clusive of those employed in agricul-
ture, were eligible for annual vacations
with pay. In 1953, almost all labor con-
tracts included paid vacations of some
d u r a t i o n . About forty-two-million
Workers are thus eligible for paid va-
cations. Because of high living stand-
ards, others are taking vacations with-
l out pay. Furthermore, three weeks is
becoming the average vacation period—
a month’s time is no longer unusual.

MARCH 1956

But the amazing thing is: We haven’t
seen anything yet. All the free time re-
ferred to above has been a result of the
first industrial revolution—the indus-
trial revolution which replaced the hu-
man hand and arm with a machine—-
and now we are well (that is, about five
years) into the second industrial revo-
lution which is replacing the human
mind with a machine. Since the mind
and the hand are frequently associated
in a single action, it will add ingenious
refinements to existing labor-saving
equipment in factory, office, and home.

Cybernetics, from the Greek word for
“steersman,” is a comparatively new
word with which we will all soon be
quite familiar, whether we want to or
not. It refers to a new science based
on recently developed electronic devices
which will give a “yes” or “no” re-
sponse to thousands and even millions
of electrical impulses fed into them in
a second. The simplest utilization of
this principle is seen in the automatic

photoelectric door opener.
The Argonne National Atomic Labo-

ratory recently announced the world’s
fastest digital computer. It can perform
some of its mathematiCal computations
in 1/2000th of a second. It can receive,
retain and process as many as 2,048
twelve-digit decimal numbers and can
memorize and store four million such
numbers. It can add certain numbers
in about 5/1,000,000ths of a second.

The Ford Company recently opened
a plant which, if it had been designed
less than five years ago, would have re-
quired some 2,000 workers. It functions
with 250 workers.

A brilliant and revealing example of
what lies ahead- for the ofiice comes out
of a fast-growing suburban bank—the
County Trust Company of White Plains,
New York. This quarter-billion-dollar
bank, one of the first to recognize the
contributions that electronic machines
could make toward lowerscost and more
efficient banking, has installed machines
that perform virtually all of the regular
banking functions automatically. —

RECREATION
for the Retired

The recreation leader has a responsibility for
introducing the adult participant to activities
which can enrich his retirement years.

ON ONE DAY a man is productive,
profitable to his employer, useful
to himself. The day after he retires he
often loses all three values unless he has
been prepared for his retirement. Part
of this preparation should be the learn-
ing of constructive and interesting ways
in which to employ his new leisure time
for a happy, useful life. His physical
and mental health will depend upon it.

Activities for adults in recreation cen-
ters, other organizations, and most par-
ticularly in industribs, should expose
participants to a variety of activities
and interests, anyone of which might
be carried over into retirement and be
developed into a lifetime interest.

Such activities can even lead to lei-
sure-time clubs after retirement; for one
of the many rewards of a hobby is the
sociability which it can bring. Hobby-
ists love to get together to exchange
ideas and to work together on their pet
projects. Some of the many activities
which can enrich life for the individual
both before and after retirement are:
woodworking; weaving; leatherwork;
other crafts of all kinds; collecting;
{lower growing; painting; sculpture;
carving; needlepoint; knitting; rug-
making; toy repairing or making;
model construction; service projects
for hospitals, children’s homes, and
other institutions; poetry and story writ-
ing; square dancing; horseshoe pitch-
ing; music; dramatics.

In Danville, Virginia, for instance,
the Retired Worker’s Workshop was
started several years ago, sponsored by
the Riverdan Benevolent Fund. The idea
originated at a retired workers’ picnic
held by Schoolfield Recreation Center.

All persons responsible for providing
recreation activities, either public or
private, also have an increasing respon-
sibility to see that older, retired persons

108

are included in their recreation pro-
grams—not shuffled off and forgotten.

Industries, on their part, are learning
that they can do much to eliminate the
frustrations which face their retired em-
ployees. Some are far-sighted enough
to make provision for preparing them
for retirement. a

The time to so prepare the employee
is not six months or a year in advance

" of his retirement day, but from three to

five years in advance. The best method
is a counseling or interviewing plan,
with guidance on how to serve himself,
his family, and his community—point-
ing up opportunities which were not
open to him during his working years.

The Esso Standard Oil company of-
fers an excellent plan of counseling and
help by conducting seminars or discus-
sion groups for employees to be re-
tired. The program consists of meetings
in small groups (ten to fifteen people)
lasting about one hour each, held at
various times. A series of five meetings
is held for the group whose retirement
is about one year off.

The General Electric Company,
Bridgeport, Connecticut, starts its pro-
gram for persons to be retired five years
in advance of retirement date. The em-
ployee is called in for an interview with
the personnel manager to discuss what
he plans to do when he retires. If he
anticipates an active retirement, aphysi-
cal examination is given, and an attempt
is made to help him get in touch with
concerns or other people interested in
the same activity. Following his retire-
ment, company representatives visit him
periodically to see how he is making out.

In other concerns, the employee about
to be retired is encouraged to join one
of the hobby groups of the company’s
employee recreation program if he has
a hobby, or to acquire a hobby having a

carry-over value if he does not have
one. Many of these groups have the
help of a counselor to direct activities
and to aid in the development of inter-

est and skills.
Some of the recreation directors in

business and industrial concerns plan
activities for the older person, and open
recreation rooms and facilities to re-
tired persons. Retired employees like
to come back to visit friends who are
still working. They like to play cards,
bowl, pitch horseshoes, and do the same
things with their “buddies” as they did
when working with them. They like to
receive the company publications, an
invitation to the company picnic, ball-
games and other recreation activities.
If the company does not have a plan
for preparing employees for retirement,
the recreation director should suggest
or recommend that such a plan be for-
mulated. Because no employee likes to
think he is old, and too often gives lit-
tle thought to retirement until it is too
late, the recreation director should not
be discouraged if only a few are inter-
ested in the recreation activities or re-
tirement plan when it is initiated. It
will be limited at first—~but will increase
if well conducted and news of it spreads.
Start only a few activities, and in-

crease the number as more people be-
come interested. Do not make the
hobby groups too large, ten to twenty
persons, depending upon the type of ac-
tivities, will be sufficient. I

Industry and the Community

Cooperate—

for Recreation

 

IN MANY CITIES, business and industrial concerns pay city

taxes, part of which are used to conduct and operate the
recreation areas and recreation program of activities, as a
part of public services to citizens. In the mill communities
in the Southern states, the mill owners construct and Oper-
ate recreation areas and facilities and conduct a village rec-
reation program, the cost of which is charged to “village
eXpense.” Some business and industrial concerns in other
cities, not having a village to maintain, conduct programs of
recreation activities and construct athletic fields, recreation
buildings, golf courses, and other areas and facilities. Many
concerns use the public recreation areas and facilities of the
municipal recreation and park departments, as well as school
and private agency facilities.

Industrial recreation and public recreation programs
should be coordinated. Duplication of program and facili-
ties should not be established when business and industrial
concerns can work with and cooperate in a united recrea-
tion program. Some good examples of cooperation and
collective community thinking are demonstrated in Midland,
Michigan, 01d Greenwich, Connecticut, and Wierton, West
Virginia.

In Midland, a new community center has just been dedi-
cated through the cooperation of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, the Dow Corning Corporation, the Dow Foundation,
and the Community Fund in constructing and maintaining
an excellent community recreation center containing over
one million cubic feet. The building has meeting rooms,
arts and crafts and photography facilities, a youth center,
snack bar, rifle range, gymnasium, swimming pool, dining
room, handball, and squash courts, steam bath and showers,
and an adjacent parking area for three hundred cars.

An operating board of nine members, serving for three-
year terms, is responsible for the conduct of the building
and its activities. The center is open to all children and

adults living in the vicinity of Midland; and, motivated

only by the desire to make Midland a better and more
pleasant place in which to live, it is dedicated to commu-
nity service.

In Weirton, through the cooperation of the Weirton Steel
Company, the city, other corporations, and the citizehs, a
fine recreation center for the entire “community has been
constructed and turned over to the Weirton Department of
Recreation to operate. The building contains a large din-
ing room, beautiful lobby, arts and crafts and other hobby
activity rooms. The physical recreation facilities are divid-
ed into three parts—each having its own gym and locker
rooms. There are separate facililties for men, ladies, and the
youth of the community. There also are a fine auditorium,
library, and offices in the building.

In Old Greenwich, the Electro-Lux Corporation after
building a fine‘ recreation center for its employees turned
the building and its athletic field over to the city depart-

.ment of recreation.

In Springfield, Vermont, the industrial and the commu-
nity recreation program are intermingled. It is a community
where the manufacture of tools for the automotive industry
is located. Six industries in the community organized a
manufacturers’ association and spent more than $80,000 in
remodeling a three-story factory building into a recreation
center for the employees and their families. The center was
operated on a partial self-support basis, with any deficit
underwritten by the manufacturers’ association.

In the basement of the building there are six bowling
alleys, showers, lockers and restrooms for both sexes, and a
craft room. On the first floor are the offices of the recrea-
tion, health, and welfare departments of the village, lobby,
lounge, clubrooms for the women’s club, and a snack bar.
The gym-auditorium, kitchen, clubrooms, lodge room, room
for the Afnerican Legion, and an assembly room for public
meetings are on the second floor.

In 1943 the manufacturers’ association turned the build-
ing over tip the recreation department and created a fund of
$32,000 to cover the cost of maintaining the building until
the villagd could carry the entire cost. The recreation center

RECREATION

is now used by every one in the village under the public rec-
reation department as apart of the year-round recreation
system. .

The village of Spindale, North Carolina, was bequeathed
an inn in the center of the village by a leading citizen, with
the proviso that the building be used as a recreation center.
The village trustees accepted the inn in 1928 and conducted
a formal program of recreation activities until the depres-
sion which almost closed the center because of lack of funds.
With the help of the WPA, and other local support, the rec-
reation program struggled along with a small budget until
1947 when the owners of the five mills in the village became
interested in the center and contributed, in proportion to
their total employees, a sum of money to repair and place in
good condition the recreation building. The village trustees
granted a recreation budget of $11,500, created a recrea-
tion commission, and a year-round recreation executive was
appointed.

The program of activities grew until it was decided that

an extension containing a gymnasium, bowling alleys,
locker and shower rooms, kitchen, and other facilities should

be added. The five mills contributed $110,000 for this proj-
ect, and the new building was dedicated in December, 1950.

Representatives from the mills serve on the recreation
commission and there is a fine cooperative spirit on the part
of all. The program of activities is conducted for the benefit
of all citizens in the community.

In other communities where business and industrial con-
cerns have built recreation areas and facilities for em-
ployees, the community very often is permitted to use the
facilities when not used by the plant for their own employee

recreation program. a

The industrial recreation director and the recreation ex-
ecutive of the community should know each other and co-
ordinate their respective recreation activities into an over-
all community recreation program. The employee activity
clubs should, and can, use the public and private commu-
nity agencies areas and facilities. It is not recommended
that any industrial or business firm build recreation areas
and facilities unless there are none that can be used in the
community. Available facilities of the public recreation and
park department, school buildings and grounds, athletic
fields, and the areas and facilities of the private, social, and
commercial agencies in the community should not be over-
looked. In most communities there are recreation facilities
such as: recreation buildings, libraries, athletic fields, swim-
ming pools, golf courses, balltields, picnic areas, and other
areas and facilities, as well as commercial bowling, pool,
and billiard halls, amusement parks, and dancehalls that
can be used for an over-all recreation program.

Public recreation executives should call upon the indus-
trial recreation director, personnel oflicer, employee service
manager, or whomever is reSponsible for the employee rec-
reation program, and inform him of the activities and fa-

cilities that are available to the employees. Many concerns
‘ would be glad to publish in the plant publication the pro-
' gram of the activities and the facilities available to their

employees. I

During his recent trip to Eur0pe and the Middle East (see
“100 Days,” RECREATION, February 1956), one part of Mr.
Rivers” interpretation of public recreation as an important
aspect of American life which made a great impact was his
emphasis on leadership for recreation. The following is a
section taken from his address in Caxton Hall, London,

where he spoke to local authorities from all parts of the

United Kingdom.

At the conclusion of the talk, The Right Honorable The
Lord Lake of Pavenham, chairman of the National Playing
Fields Association of England, who presided, said: “Mr.
Rivers has taken a technical subject, lifted it to the realm
of statesmanship and inspired us all.” The full address was
printed in British magazines and widely distributed.

 

Thomas E. Rivers

WE ARE only half-way through with our trip. We go next
to the Middle East where in a number of these great
new nations there is a keen interest in recreation.

But, even at this point, I am thrilled to tell you that we
have seen enough and learned enough to believe that in
the rapidly developing recreation movement throughout the
world there lies not only the possibility for life enrichment
in thenvarious lands, but a great potential for bringing about
a further understanding between nations that can contribute
to peace and world unity.

Certainly those working in the leisure time—recreation
movement—of all professions—know that no leisure can be
fruitful, no recreation joyous, in a world at war.

Here, then, is another note of hope in a troubled world:
The outlook for welding together the recreation authorities
of the world in a common effort, through recreation, prom-
ises another means of' tying mankind together in peaceful
cooperation.

If we can do this in our special field and multiply the
process then there is one less reason for fearing the atom,
and one more reason for preparing for the constructive use
of the leisure that the peaceful use of nuclear energy will
insure.

This will require leadership of a high order. No states-
manship has had a heavier responsibility, no profession a
greater challenge.

One of the outstanding features of the recreation move-
ment in America, and one which perhaps is unique, is that
its leadership has attained full-fledged professional status.
Though not so widely known as law, medicine, ministry, or

education, recreation has become widely recognized as one
of the main divisions of life. It ranks with work, worship,
learning, and, therefore, requires comparable leadership.

Also, recreation is now generally accepted as a function
of local government just as are education, police and fire
protection, health and street services.

This recognition—along with the tremendous capital in-
vestment in facilities, areas and buildings, the very large
annual expenditures for operations-—and the potentialities
of leisure for health, happiness, and citizenship are so great
that this whole area of human need must be served by tech-
nically-trained, professionally-prepared leaders.

Fortunately, our local authorities—and the public gener-
ally——now accept the point of view that, of all the essentials
for a good recreation department, leadership is the most
important, and that quality leadership is the best investment
and the only assurance of an adequate, economical, and
satisfactory recreation service.

This concept did not come overnight. It has been growing
for fifty years. It has been closely related to the purpose
and sustained promotion of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation. It is also related to the abundance of our natural
resources, and their development, which made it possible
to allocate funds for this purpose as the need was recog-
nized and the idea sold to our cities.

This was and still is a “selling” job. Our National Rec-
reation Association has borne the responsibility for this
interpretive and selling task.

The wide-spread development of community recreation in
America—with extensive facilities, its variety of service for
all age groups the year-round, and its accepted place in our
national life——has come about largely because of the exis-
tence of an ever-increasing number, and constantly improv-
ing quality, of professionally-trained personnel, now esti-

mated to number over twenty thousand men and women
serving as full-time, year-round, professional recreation
leaders in private, voluntary, and government agencies.

Back in 1907, at our First National Recreation Congress,
training for playground leadership was one of the subjects
discussed. One committee, among others, was appointed to
develop a “Normal Course in Play for Professional Direct-
ors.” Two years later, Normal Course was published and,
for nearly twenty years, with revisions, was the standard
textbook. In 1925 it was superseded by Introduction to

t Community Recreation1 by George Butler of the NRA.

Another important step taken at that time was the employ-
ment by-the Association of the author of Normal Course,
Dr. Clark W. Hetherington, who for two years visited a large
number of colleges, universities, and normal schools to give
advice and help to faculties on the training of recreation
workers. This book and this service to colleges became the
solid foundation upon which the recreation profession in
America has been built.

All through the years the Association continued to watch
for opportunities to expand the whole area of training. Dur-
ing World Wars I and II, during the economic depression,
in connection with special campaigns of promotion to open
up new recreation departments in cities, preceding the de-
velopment of special new areas of recreation service like
rural recreation, institutional recreation, hospital recreation
—for these and other purposes, various kinds of institutes,
short courses, long courses, correspondence courses, appren-
tice programs were devised. All this time, the idea was
growing that recreation required a basic training {and that
special areas of service required specialized training.
Following World.War I there was a tremendous expan-

sion of recreation. The responsibilities of recreation lead-
ership became so important that the Association itself estab-
lished the National Recreation School for graduate training
in recreation, and conducted it for nine years. Many of the
top leaders of recreation in America today are graduates of
this school.

Perhaps its greatest service was in demonstrating the
value of graduate training and in pioneering methods,
course content, field training, and in placement of graduates.

During both the economic depression of the thirties and
World War II, recreation services were widely provided.
As a result, after each was over, community recreation ex-
panded rapidly with a consequent demand for trained
leaders.

To this demand colleges responded quickly. Today sev-
eral hundred colleges give some kind of course in recrea-
tion; but some sixty colleges and universities report major
curricula in recreation. In almost any section of the coun-
try today a prospective recreation leader may take his
master’s or doctorate degree in recreation. Some colleges
specialize in training for limited areas such as rural, indus-
trial, or hospital recreation.

These institutions are yearly turning out leaders to swell
the ranks of the twenty thousand leaders mentioned above.
These professional leaders in public recreation agencies
alone are assisted by over one hundred thousand volunteer
leaders. Indeed, one of the tests of expert professional lead-
ership is the capacity to enlist and utilize successfully the

tremendous volunteer manpower available for human
service.

Professional Status

I have mentioned that the acceptance of the idea of recre-
ation leadership being a profession was a selling ob. Here

are some of the reasons and facts which give this leadership
professional status: '

1. Recreation is a recognized human need.

2. It is one of the effective ways to use leisure time with
resultant individual and social values.

3. Leisure time—the time free from the necessity of
earning a living—is increasing. Its use for constructive
purposes is important.

4. Men and women who provide a service to meet this
human need are performing a socially useful function.

5. There is a philosophy, and well-defined theories, un-
derlying current practices. Incidentally the theory goes
back to Aristotle, who said, “The aim of education is the
wise use of leisure.” ‘

6. The recreation program includes all the basic human
interests and skills—physical, musical, dramatic, artistic,
nature, outdoor, scientific, and service. _

7. There are well-established methods and principles of
organizing and administering a public recreation program
for all ages. “19+

113

8. There is a comprehensive literature dealing with many
aspects of recreation. This is being enriched by scientific
research and cooperative compilation of experience.

9. Standards are the hallmark of a profession, and recrea-
tion has a whole series of standards by which we can judge
our work:

0 Standards for a good recreation department. There are
nine.

0 Personnel standards. The NRA. manual on this subject
lists twenty-two positions commonly identified in commu-
nity recreation agencies, gives titles, function, qualifications,
training and experience required and range of salaries.2

0 Standards for areas and facilities.
0 Suggested standards for expenditures.

0 Standards for training—in-service, undergraduate, and
graduate.

10. There is an organized professional society with a
code of ethics.

11. Above all, those who devote themselves to recreation
leadership are finding a satisfaction that is as challenging
and rewarding as any other form of human service.

We need to make known to the public that the leadership
of the recreation movement is composed of a body of men
and women who are finding great satisfaction in serving a
basic human need; that they should be recognized and ade-
quately compensated for it; that they take pride in the tech-
niques and skills required to provide a varied program
based on a sound theory and philosophy; that they have
standards and a code of ethics comparable to other pro-
fessions.

My plea is for giving professional status to recreation
leadership as such. Recreation is not a part of teaching,
not a division of physical education, not a section of social
work or of youth service. It is, I repeat, a great area of
human service for men, women and children of all ages. It
is our belief that the service and the profession itself will
go further and faster if it stands on its own feet.

Now I recognize that each country must develop its own
program in its own way. But I feel strongly that we will
all profit more if recreation is pulled out of any subordi-
nate relationship and identified for what it is; that its prog-
ress can be furthered if its development in each country can
be in the hands of a strong central agency, private or gov-
ernmental as the pattern of the country may require, whose

sole or principal purpose is the enrichment of the human
spirit through recreation.

And from this I envision an International Recreation
Association to which we all can contribute, from which we

all can learn, and through which we all can work together
for the common benefit of all mankind.

Nuclear Energy Can Provide Leisure for All Nations

For those nations whose industrial stability and economy
are already assured, recreation offers a great opportunity.
For now, of all times, mankind is nearer to realizing the

How to Apply Them. 3.50. LP— 0 6y Are’

dream of the ages—freedom from soul-killing labor. Nor
is leisure for all just a dream. The peaceful use of nuclear'
energy can and, I believe will, insure it. I am not a physicist
nor a student of nuclear developments, but the revelations
made at Geneva a few weeks ago, and information being
published and broadcast daily, all point to a most amazing
variety of uses to which the atom may be put to do the
peaceful work of the world.

Dean Dunning of the Columbia University Engineering
School has emphasized that the discrimination imposed upon
“have not” nations by the unequal distribution of economic
resources need no longer be a handicap to progress.

Atomic material can be transported. One one-inch-cube
of uranium contains as much latent energy as six hundred
thousand pounds of coal. Atomic energy will provide an
almost unlimited supply of electricity.

The United States is now considering building and sup-
plying reactors to underdeveloped nations so that they may
make their own electricity. Uranium can also be supplied
to them if they do not have natural resources to build their

'own. Such an economic resource will provide the founda-

tion for a rich cultural and leisure-time program.

To back-weary mankind, leisure in itself may seem to be
the goal. But you and I know it is not so. How it is used
will determine whether it is a blessing or a curse. Just as
the atom may make the desert bloom or may blast man-
made civilization into oblivion, so leisure may provide the
opportunity for the release of man’s highest creative expres-
sions or become the quagmire into which he and his ideals
will sink and his spark of divinity be smothered in the slime
of neglect. Here then is the supreme challenge to the recre-
ation leaders of the world.

It has been said the greatness of a nation is measured by
the quality of its play. The central organization in each
land that guides the people’s leisure is an infinitely precious
possession. It should attract the keenest minds, the noblest
hearts, and the finest spirits in the nation. Their influence
will spread until it literally will lift the whole level of its
life and thus help to influence and enrich the living of all
peoples.

The association of your own country has a priceless mis-
sion. Its possibilities for service to families, churches, cities,
schools, clubs, to men and women and children throughout
the land are unlimited.

Anyone who has seen children of different lands brought
together in the spirit of play must have had his hopes for a
peaceful happy world renewed. I like to think, and I firmly
believe, that you and I, and all men and women of all lands,
who are dedicated to the task of seeing that children every-
where have a chance for safe happy play, that youth experi-
ence growth and comradeship through recreation, and that
all men and women have opportunities and facilities neces-
sary to use leisure for the highest development of human
life, are the means for realizing these hopes.

In our hands as workers and lay leaders of the recreation

movement may, in a large measure, rest the happiness of
the people of the world.

To this end let us all be united in cooperation and
friendship. I

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

 

Title Change

At a conference in Detroit in F ebru-
ary, representatives of 1,900 United
Funds, Community Chests, and Com-
munity Welfare Councils in the United
States and Canada voted to change the
national association’s corporate title
from Community Chests and Councils
of America, Incorporated, to United
Community Funds and Councils of
America, Incorporated. The move to
broaden the national organization name
was made in recognition of the growing
number of United Funds as well as
Community Chests which have in-
creased the scope of their annual cam-
paigns for local health and welfare serv-
ices to include funds for national and
local health service and research ap-
peals such as Red Cross, cancer, heart,
and crippled children. The United Fund
plan now Operates in 821 communities.

James A. Linen, publisher of Time
magazine, was elected president of the
national association which represents
the federated fund-raising campaign
idea.

IN MEMORIAM

Mrs. Sigmund Stern

Mrs. Sigmund Stern of San Francis-
co, 3 member of the board of directors
of the National Recreation Association
since 1940, died on February 8. For
many years Mrs. Stern served on the
San Francisco Playground Committee,
the Recreation Commission and the
Recreation and Park Commission, from
which she resigned only a short time
before her death. As a member of the
commission, and part of the time as
chairman, Mrs. Stern gave effective
leadership to recreation in San Fran-
cisco.

She was active in welcoming and en-
tertaining delegates to the First Inter-
national Recreation Congress in Los

Angeles in 1932.

In memory of her husband, Mrs.
Stern gave to San Francisco the Sig-
mund Stern Grove. She conceived the
idea of organizing the Junior Civic
Symphony which has been, since 1931,
one of the most effective parts of the
San Francisco recreation program. She
was chairman of a special committee
that arranged for the notable amateur
music program during the San Francis-

co World’s Fair in 1939.

Mrs. Stern was interested in the whole
recreation movement and was an active
supporter of, and contributor to, the
entire work of the National Recreation
Association. "

The first event of the Fiftieth Anni-

versary-Year celebration of the Nation-
al Recreation Association has taken
place. On January 25, the Association’s
new permanent headquarters at Eight
West Eighth Street, New York, were
dedicated at a formal ceremony and
open house from three to six o’clock.
All members of the Association and rep-
resentatives of "national and local or-
ganizations were invited, and many out-
of-town guests were numbered among
the over three hundred who attended.

The principal speaker on the brief
formal program was Luther Gulick, for-
mer New York city administrator and
president of the Institute of Public Ad-
ministration. Mr. Gulick’s uncle, Dr.
Luther Halsey Gulick, a prominent New
York educator and s ocial worker,
helped organize the National Recrea-
tion Association in 1906 and served as
its first president until 1910.

The officials of the National Recrea-
tion Association who addressed the
guests were Otto T. Mallery, chairman
of the board of directors, and Joseph
Prendergast, executive director. Dr.
Nathan Perilma'n of Temple Emanu-El
gave the invocation; The Rev. Dr. Paul
Moore, Jr., of Grace Episcopal Church
in Jersey City and a member of the As-
sociation’s Board of Directors, the dedi-
cation prayer;. and The Rev. John F.
Brennan, moderator for the CYO, Bor-
ough of Manhattan, the benediction.

Immediately following the ceremony,
“The Fellowship of Recreation,” a five-
by-ten-foot oil-on-canvas mural, by Da-

Dedication of New Headquarters

vid G. Asherman, was unveiled in the
Recreation Personnel Services offices.
Challenged to express a theme appropri-
ate to the development and stimulation
of increasing professional recreation
leadership, the artist drew his inspira-
tion from the address by Dr. Albert S.
Raubenheimer, educational vice-presi-
dent of the University of Southern Cali-
fornia in Los Angeles, delivered at the
1955 National Recreation Congress.

The new headquarters for the N ation-
al Recreation Association is the former
home of the Whitney Museum of Amer-
ican Art. The four-story building has
been completely redecorated for the As-
sociation’s seventy-five-member staff.
Its historic studios, long devoted to
American art, lend graciousness to the
home of American recreation. Readers
may be interested to know that the great
seated figure of Lincoln, by Daniel
Chester French, now in the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, was created
here, as were Columbia University’s
golden goddess, Alma Mater, and many
other famous pieces. '

Guests were shown through the build-
ing 'in small'groups, and were served
refreshments in the personnel service
offices, the library, and in the exhibit
room. A friendly informality added to
everyone’s enjoyment, and great inter-
est in the new offices and the various
Association displays was evident.

Hundreds of letters, telegrams, spe-
cial messages, and flowers arrived dur-
ing the day, coming from recreation
departments, commissions and boards,
societies, colleges, and from individuals

and organizations within and outside
the recreation field. The few quoted
below are typical of the many:

0 I am wearing two hats this morning. One
as the executive director of RP and S [Wil-
mington, Delaware, Recreation and Promotion
Service] and the other as president of ARS.
In both capacities, I wish to tell you how
thrilled I was yesterday to see the new look,
the‘ refreshing atmosphere, the enthusiastic
spirit of the personnel, and the general feeling
of “Go, Go, Go! ” in and around the new head-
quarters of NRA.

I wish to congratulate you on this great
achievement in obtaining a permanent head-
quarters on NRA’s 50th year of service and
wish you great success in the years to come.—
George T. Sargisson, President,A merican Rec-
reation Society, Washington 5, D. C.

Camping, Boy Scouts of America, New Bruns-
wick, New Jersey.

From Dedication Prayer

0 Thou great Giver of every good and perfect gift, we thank Thee for
this moment of culmination. We rejoice in the onward progress of our great
movement. May the sense of exaltation and dedication we feel today glow
brightly within us. May we in our new and beautiful surroundings'be able
to relate ourselves ever more closely to the human needs of those we serve.
May no machinery or pattern of procedure dim in us the deep and abiding
sense that we are working for enlarged and satisfying life experience for
our brothers. As we press forward in this pioneer adventure of the human
spirit, help us to see clearly and act nobly.—Edna V. Braucher.* '

Softball Plus
. . . for GIRLS

A program which illustrates the fact that
the addition of related social activities can
contribute to the successful handling of
athletics for girls.

Catherine A. Wilkinson

“BATTER UP!” is a familiar call during June and July eve-
nings in Phoenix where the parks and recreation de-
partment sponsors a city-wide -Girls Recreation Softball

League on park and school playgrounds.

Membership on teams is open to girls who have not re-
ceived remuneration in any sport. Girls who have ceased to
be afiiliated with a softball team sponsored by commercial
firms or individuals may play for one of the area teams, and
are eligible to play in the league during the summer, pro-
vided they do not aililiate or practice with a commercially
sponsored team during the league season.

Classification of groups for the summer season, accord-
ing to June first each year, are:

Open Class: Teenagers or adults.
ClassA: High school sophomores (completed grade) or above
- through age 19; or girls not in school, ages 16 through 19.

Class B: Eighth grade graduates and high school freshmen or girls
ages 13 through 15 who have graduated from eighth grade
and .are not in school.

Class C: Girls in elementary school, above age 12.

Class D: Girls in elementary school, ages 12 and under.

A player may play one class higher, but thereafter is 

eligible to play in a lower class during the season.

Registration for area teams is conducted in April and
May by the local elementary and high school physical edu-
cation instructors for the parks and recreation department.
This department assigns one woman on its staff to organize
and direct the league. Each area recreation leader is re-
sponsible for the supervision of the area teams and for the
volunteers who serve as coaches, umpires, and transporta-
tion committees. Frequently, fathers of the girls serve as
team coaches. Volunteer umpires for each area are inter-
ested adults or boys who play summer baseball. The trans-
portation committees are usually made up of the parents of
the players. Proper chaperonage and transportation of the
girls is stressed; each car or truck used carries liability in-
surance and has a licensed adult driver.

Games are scheduled as much as possible on a home and
home-area basis. The open class plays one game a week and
two games a week are scheduled for the other classes. No
games are permitted with teams outside of the league. Games

are five innings, and ties are not played off. A game may b
terminated after three innings or subsequent innings i
there has been one hour of play and a team is ahead by te
runs. On double-headers no new inning may start after on
and one-fourth hours of playing time for the open, A, and ]
classes. This rule applies for the C and D classes at all times
There are two divisions in the league so that the averag
travel distance between areas is one and one-half miles.
League play is scheduled in two halves, one in June an
one in July. League standings of teams are determined 0
a percentage basis. Class winners of each half in their div
sion have a one-game playoff for division winners. The cit
championship is a one-game playoff between division wir
ners for classes A, B, C, and D. The open class is city-wid
and does not require a division playoff for the city chan
pionship. Weekly schedules are mailed to area leaders, an
the newspapers run daily game schedules and results. Fez
ture articles appear in the papers throughout the season.

There are city-wide special events arranged for leagu
teams during the season. The first event is a rules an
umpires’ clinic for recreation leaders, coaches, umpires, an
players. At this meeting representatives from the Arizon
Umpires Association conduct a question and answer sessio
on the oflicial rules, and give demonstrations of legal pitcl
ing and umpiring techniques. This event is followed by a
evening “Get Acquainted Party” held at one of the pool
before league games begin. At this party, swimming, vo
leyball, and table games are featured and introductions c
recreation leaders, coaches, and teams are made. Form:
league activities are culminated the last week in July wit
city championship games and two citywide swim and wateJ
melon parties.

The C and D classes have their party after the class *
playoff game, and the open, A and B classes have a part
following the class A championship game. The players eac
contribute twenty-five cents for the watermelon party and th

recreation leaders‘and all volunteers are their guests. There
is no charge for the swimming. More than three-fourths of
the league members and leaders turn out for their swim
and watermelon party.

League players are well coached in the rules, playing skills
and tactics. Sliding is not permitted in this league, any
attempt is an automatic out. Softball etiquette is inculcated
through good sportsmanship and the desire to win by super-
ior ability. A spirit of courtesy toward opponents, the of-
ficials, and team mates is required. Heckling of players or
umpires is not permitted by teams or spectators.

Uniforms are not encouraged, but, if desired, may be fur-
nished by each girl and must be made of cotton material
with a shirt-style blouse. Shoes must be worn, preferably
tennis shoes, but no spikes are allowed. Girls are urged to
own their own gloves. Some gloves are furnished at each
area as well as all other; playing equipment. To avoid finger
injuries, new balls are not used and leather balls are sup-
plied from the parks department’s men’s league where they
have been used in one game

The league is governed by a girls’ softball committee.

Each volunteer coach (must be age twenty-one or older)
who has a team in the league is a member of this committee.
Three area recreation leaders are appointed by the league
director to serve as a protest committee, and one of these
leaders must be from an area without a team in the league.
Seldom are there protests on games.

A set of league rules have evolved from the foregoing com-
mittee as well as from the women physical education in-
structors of the Phoenix high schools. These rules have
developed in the interests of the girls’ health, safety, and
welfare. Standards for the program are in accord with the
National Section for Girls and Women’s Sports of the Amer-
ican Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recre-
ation, a department of the National Education Association.

There were 1,051 players in the 1955 league season repre-
senting forty-seven teams under the supervision of thirty
recreation leaders with 256 volunteer leaders; 260 games
were played.

From a beginning of six teams in 1948, the league has
grown steadily each season, illustrating that in Phoenix it’s
fun for girls to play recreational softball. l

The large bulletin board designed to announce the month’s program. As-
sistant service club director explains tie-in of the localities with the musnc.

IN ORQER to create more interest in the
weekly post dances and to increase
attendance, the above over-all theme
was chosen and developed for a series
of four parties. One of the purposes of
theming around a focal point is to give
'continuity to the thinking and planning
of the staff and a continuity of program
for the men and their guests. Dances
are probably the easiest type of program
to theme; clever names, decorations,
mixers, and activities almost fall into
place naturally. Development of themes
varies. In this case, song titles about
spring were used as the basis for plan-
ning: .“Easter Parade,” “April in
Paris,” “Springtime in the Rockies,”
and “April in Portugal.” Each pro-
vided the theme for one of the dances.
Preparation time varied in each case;
however, one of the advantages of over-
all planning is that.time and materials
can be saved by using some of the dec-
orations throughout the month. For in-
stance, the overhead green and white
streamers chosen for March were still
suitable for April. The cherry tree con-
structed by the men for the George
Washington’s Birthday Dance was just
as ellective,_with.the addition of a few
green leaves, fdr the Rockies party.
Special decorations on the stage curtain
and on the entrance were changed
weekly in keeping with the current
theme. Preparation of decorations, the

120

biggest time consumer, was usually
done when there were men in the club
to assist. Intermission activities and
mixers take only a little preparation._

Budgeting for theme dances is the
same as for a regular dance. A few in-
expensive prizes which can vary with
the available budget are necessary. Spe-
cial refreshments could be elaborate,
but we kept their cost at a minimum.

Coordination and cooperation be-
tween the local military units and the
community results in a much better pro-
gram. The local units are always more
than Willing to assist and were called
upon several times during the month.
The engineers’ carpentry shop helped
with decorations; mess halls provided
special refreshments; post Signal Corps
sent photographers; the motor pool
provided transportation; and the Sixth
Army Band was responsible for the
music. The Red Cross Chapter’s volun-
teer service bureau provided hostesses.
Girls from nearby communities not
serviced by bus transportation formed
car pools. Arrangements were made
with local firms for decorations.

Many mediums were used to publi-
cize “Around the World in Spring-
time.” Probably the most effective was
the laige bulletin board in the entrance
lobby. A large colorful map of the
world served as the background. Copies

were mounted around the map, with rib-
bons connecting them to each related
spot on the map. Eight-by-five cards
showing weekly program events were
placed on the board which framed the
main display. Each week the current
dance was publicized in the post paper,
and in the service club bulletin which
has post distribution. Decorating three
or four days in advance was another
means of arousing interest, especially
since the men took part. Announce-
ments were made at the previous dance
and also at the Sunday night shows.

The enlisted men were generous witl
their assistance in preparing for these
programs. Decorating for the “Apri
in Paris” dance was an all-day Sunday
and a Monday evening program. En
thusiasm spread, and the decorations
were much more elaborate than hat
been planned. Some of the dances host
esses volunteered their services to hell
decorate. They also planned and pre
sented skits at intermission.

The entire staff, as always, were 01

essary to have both directors present 5:

Easter Parade

The first dance of the series preced-
3d Easter and was called “Easter Pa-
rade.” Large colorful cutouts of play-
311] rabbits were pinned to the back-
stage curtain, and to other curtains
around the club. The refreshment table
was decorated with Easter baskets,
flowers, candles and an Easter table-
:loth. Card tables with candles and
:hecked tablecloths were arranged in
cabaret style around the dance floor. Re-
freshments were those which are stand-
ard fare for most of our dances—cook-
ies, coffee, and punch.

As the girls arrived they were invited
to the “millinery bar” to make an Easter
hat. Nonsense articles of indescribable
variety were all assembled on the table,
in addition to scissors, tape, pins, and
so on. The girls were asked to make a
hat that could be worn, and to keep it
until intermission. During intermis-
sion each selected an escort and bestow-
ed her creation upon his head. Then we
had our “Easter Parade.” Audience ap-
plause determined the winners of prizes.

April in Paris

“April in Paris” was the second, and
most elaborate, party in the series. Dec-
orations, _entertainment, and refresh-
ments were more detailed, mainly be-
cause of the interest and enthusiasm of
the men. Carpenters constructed a
wooden frame on the refreshment table
and added a handle on one end. One
of the men added a red-and-white paper
awning, highlighted with colored
Christmas lights and paper flowers, and
a large paper wheel. This duplicated
the flower or fruit stands that are fa-
mous in Paris, and also served as the cof-
fee bar. A sergeant spent many hours
stretching crepe-paper streamers and
pinning them to the backstage curtain
to make an outline of the Eiffel Tower.
Colored lctters——APRIL IN PARIS—were
added. A chicken-wire false front was
made to separate the entrance hall of
the club from the main lounge and form
an archway into the ballroom. On the
wire were posted colorful posters of
France. The ingenious engineers con-
structed the famous sidewalk cafes
along one side of the club, with hang-
ing signs naming each cafe in the tradi-
tion of the Parisian nightclubs. Tables

122

with candles and red-checked table-
cloths were placed inside the cafes and
along the area in front of each one.
French menus were placed on each
table and aroused much curiosity as to
what was to be served. Two of the men
acted as French waiters,wearing medic
whites and pushing a cuisine cart from
table to table, serving the guests. Sand-
wiches were made from messhall dona-
tions, and one of the men volunteered
to bake some very delicious cakes on
his day off.

During intermission some of the
dance hostesses presented a skit on
Paris. Following this, one of the men
acted as a wandering musician and
played accordion numbers and requests.

Springtime in the Rockies

A Rocky Mountain range was cut out
of no-seam paper, and pinned to the
backstage curtain. A smiling moon and
colored cutout letters announcing
“Springtime in the Rockies” completed
the stage decoration. The chicken-wire
frame in the entrance was decorated
with flowers, travel folders and maps
from the Rocky Mountain states.

The guests were invited to come
dressed in dude ranch clothes—levis
and cotton dresses. All guests were
given an “Autograph Lotto” card as
they entered and instructed to introduce
themselves to as many people as there
were squares on the card, and to get
their autographs. During intermission
two games of bingo and a campfire sing
provided entertainment. When the
lights were dimmed, the red footlights
on stage and the candles on the tables
gave a campfire effect.

Hot dogs, potato chips, olives, rel-
ishes, coffee, and punch were served to
the guests from a roving chuck wagon.

April in Portugal

Some of the dance hostesses asked if
they might plan, and decorate for, this
dance. A badminton net was draped
across the backstage curtain and color-
ful paper fish were attached to this.
The dance title was spelled out in col-
ored cutout letters which were pinned

around the fish net. Colored streamers

represented the lines attached to the net.

More of the fish and colored paper flow-
ers were scattered on the chicken-wire
archway. The little refreshment cart,

which has remained a permanent fixture
in the club, was converted from a flower
cart to a fish stand with the addition of
a few signs and paper fish.

Guessing games are always popular.
A can of Portuguese sardines was put
on display with a sign, “How many sar-
dines do the Portuguese put in a can?
Place your guess in the jar.” During
intermission, a ceremony was made of
opening the can and counting the fish.
A can of sardines was awarded the win-
ner. Next, the guests were invited to
become Portuguese fishermen. Hun-
dreds of small squares of colored pa-
per, representing fish, had been hidden
throughout the club. The guests were
to catch as many of these fish as they
could in five minutes. A prize was

given to the winner.

Evaluation

In evaluating the whole program the
directors feel that the series has been
much more successful than regular
dances. More emphasis has been placed

, on the weekly dances, more people have

been attracted, and in considering the
reduction of troops in this area, the
attendance has been very good. There
has been more interest among the dance
hostesses and many new girls have
joined the group. The reaction of the
men and hostesses has been satisfying.

In recommending this program for
other service clubs or public recreation
areas, a few considerations should be
emphasized. Special days, events,
weeks, or months can be enhanced by
the addition of an organized plan or
theme. Timing, coordination, variety,
and flexibility are some of the points to
consider in theme development.

This particular program is geared for
April; however, there are other songs
that would be suitable for a series in
other seasons. The ideas and activities
should be coordinated by the staff to
present a total program that has conti-
nuity and clear meaning. The activi-
ties in the themed series should have
variety. For instance, some of the deco-
rations and the intermission activities
varied at each of our parties.

Flexibility is one of the keynotes of
any good recreation program. No pro-
gram should be so stereotyped that it
can’t be altered or improved as the need
arises during the presentation. I

RECREATION

 

Riding High-

More and more recreation departments are hnding out that it is not dificult

to arrange a horseback riding program. They find, too, that here is an activity

that offers the lost flavor of adventure.

We know that boating and sailing no longer are activities available only to

wealthy. Are we sure that horseback riding isn’t equally attainable at reason-

able cost? And doesn’t it meet with most specifications of a jine activity—is

suitable for a wide age-range, requires active participation, is capable of pro-

gression, and can become,a healthy leisure-time activity for adult years?

Eastchester, New York, thought so—and proved it!

NEN’T WE agreed that we should offer

instructional and participation op-
portunities to our people in recreation
and emphasize sport activities which
they may continue to enjoy as they
grow older? Activities such as golf,
swimming, bowling, tennis, and other
sports?

The town of Eastchester, New York,
lies right in the center of the elite West-
chester County riding circles. But hun-
dreds of children in Eastchester peeked
through the fences to watch the more
fortunate junior set perform in their
fashionable riding shows.

The Eastchester Recreation Commis-
sion approached one of the popular rid-
ing academies with a proposition to
give all the children of Eastchester a
chance to ride if they wanted to. For
exactly one-fifth of the usual charge,
this riding academy agreed to give in-
dividual lessons to any child in East-
chester if the application came from the

recreation commission. That was six

years ago—and the time of the birth

of the Eastchester Recreation Riding
Club.

the different classes of beginners, in-
termediates, and advanced. Classes are
after school from Monday to Friday.
Once a week each class of ten children,
who are all on par, gets one-hour in-

THE SNAKE CLUB

Bring up a chair and sit down . . . to
a menu that includes rattlesnake meat
and maybe turtle soup. That’s the invi-
tation given by members of the “Loyal
Order of the Serpent,” a snake club
formed by members of the recreation
department in Fayetteville, North Caro-
lina, in 1954-.

Banquets and dinners are only one
part of the diversified activities of club
members. They go on snake hunts and
field trips, do research into the habits
of reptiles and methods of capturing
them, and collect stories about them.

“We make recordings of scientific in-
formation concerning snakes caught by
members of the club. This includes the
size, markings and colorings, environ-
ment, rate of growth in captivity, feed-
ing habits, reaction of snakes to hand-
ling, and other information which
might be useful in the study of the rep-
tiles,” says Hank Hickman, one of the
charter members.

After capture, some of snakes are
on display at the city zoo, while lectures
on their habits are given to interested
groups. Some of them are mounted. A
camera is always handy so pictures of
snakes commonly found in this area can
be used for public information.

One encouraging fact brought out by
the group’s research is that the percent-
age of poisonous snakes in the Fayette-
ville area is very low. While most of

the larger snakes~will bite when cor-
nered, they will usually run if possible.

“Take the water moccasin,” said
Hank as he pointed out a scary-seeming
specimen. “It is usually just a common,
harmless water snake although many
think every snake living in the water is
poisonous. The one poisonous water
snake found in our area is the cotton-
mouth moccasin and it is seldom seen.”

During their search several members
of the club have also picked up‘a few
tall tales. Gene McMillan, chairman of
the club, mentioned this one:

“A man was telling me the other day
that he was on maneuvers in Onslow
County when they came upon a group
of about five hundred snakes in the
woods. They were shocked and amazed
. . . and then all of a sudden, one of the
snakes coiled into‘ a hoop—with his tail
in his mouth—rolled up against the leg
of one of the men, fhen rolled, into a
tree, unfolded, and slinked away into
the woods.”—Condensed from an arti-
cle by Bobbie Brewer in the Fayette-
ville Observer.

* ‘I 4* ‘I

Mr. Hickman, assistant superintend-
ent of recreation and parks in Fayette-
ville, writes us further that among the
major club projects has been the con-
struction and decoration of the reptile
room at the city museum. Two new
cages have recently been added and dec-
orated, giving the club six large diSplay

cages. Each has been arranged to rep-
resent natural habitats for the snakes,
through the use of pyrex baking dishes
(for lakes), rocks, artificial grass, and
paint. Logs and overhanging limbs
have, also been placed in some of the
cages. Particular care has been given
so as not to hide the snakes from public
view and at the same time to provide a
simulated natural habitat.

Publicity by the club has drawn a lot
of attention to the museum and has
been responsible for numerous dona-
tions of live specimens. Various indi-
viduals in this section of North Carolina
have become interested in the club and
are constantly in touch with it.

One of the club’s friends in Whiteville
recently donated an alligator and seven
cotton-mouth moccasins t0 the museum.
Another has given several copper-heads
and four-lined chicken snakes. Various
young boys in town have brought in
hog-nose snakes, corn snakes, black
snakes, water snakes, and so on, to make
quite a nice collection.

Charts of poisonous and non-poison-
ous snakes are being made for display
in the room. Gene McMillan, who is in
charge of the zoo' here, has also been

-making rubber models of the different

species of snakes. He does this by
making a plaster cast and then filling
it with liquid latex. These models are
then painted in the snake’s natural color
and make a very realistic appearance.

DOG TRAINING CLUB

The Berks County Dog Training
Club, in Reading, Pennsylvania, owes
part of its seven years of success to its
working relationship with the local rec-
reation department, and is considered
part of the adult curriculum of that de-
partment. Under recreation department
sponsorship, a high school stadium is
obtained for training sessions, and a

trophy awarded for high scorer in the
club’s annual dog obedience trial.

As a civic group, the Dog Training
Club provides assembly programs for
schools, and speakers and demonstra-
tions for civic clubs, church groups, and
other organizations. For these pro-
grams the club member in charge ex-
plains the origin, history, and purpose
in developing a particular canine breed.
Since many breeds are discussed during
a program, the informative talk on any
particular breed is limited to three min-
utes; however, this type of program is

one that is most enthusiastically re-

ceived at the schools and at adult group
meetings.

During these programs an officer of
the club acts as moderator and later ex-
plains how a dog trained to obey he-
comes an asset to the community
through its good behavior. By pro-
viding this service the club builds its
prestige. It is also a method of obtain-
ing donors of trophies for its dog trials
and matches.

The highlight of the club’s 1953 ac-
tivities was the entertainment it gave
for eighty-four crippled children in the
Philadelphia Shriners Hospital. The
program was presented in conjunction
with the Nobles of the Rajah Temple
A.A.O.N.M.S. (Shriners). A group of

fifteen, composed of Dog Training Club
members, members of Rajah Temple,
and a member of the Berks Camera
Club, journeyed to the hospital where
they presented the children with gifts

I and a demonstration by the club’s

championship collie dog team. A pic-
torial account of the children’s delight
with the program was recorded by the
member of the camera club. The pro-
gram was continued an hour and a half
over the alloted time at the request of
the patients and hospital staff. Letters
of request for a return engagement were
received shortly after this most success-
ful program.

Another noteworthy activity of the
club is its cooperation with the city po-
lice department in attempting to solve
its problems with dogs. The club sup-
plies cards informing the owners of of-
fensive dogs that free classes in methods
of correcting their pets’ bad habits are
offered. Those most frequently re-
quiring correction are excessive bark-
ing, chasing cars, failure to answer
when called, and running at large, all
of which make the dog unacceptable to
the owner’s neighbors and lead to com-
plaints and hard feelings, which can be
avoided by schooling the dog.

Through these services to the com-
munity, the Berks County Dog Training
Club has earned its prestige as a civic
organization and offers assistance to
any other clubs desiring to follow its
pattern. For information on any phase
of the club’s activities, write to the club

Community-Supported Recreation
in the Saint Paul Area*

A Review

This is a report of a survey of recreation services offered
by public and voluntary Welfare agencies in St. Paul and
Ramsey County, and West St. Paul, Minnesota.

Aimed to create a plan for “dove-tailing into a correlated
system a diversity of recreation opportunities,” this am-
bitious survey will, no doubt, stand as a valid guidepost
for many years in the St. Paul area. Also, whoever may
be contemplating a metropolitan survey of recreation any-
where would do well to study this one for scope and method.

The physical limits of the survey embrace twenty-one
study areas (neighborhoods) within the city of St. Paul;
also one small city, seven suburban villages, and three town-
ships of Ramsey County.

Full exploration of the administration and management
of the municipal departments of parks and playgrounds is
undertaken. The survey directive called only for an evalua-
tion of the capital fund and physical plant needs of voluntary
agencies; but, a number of recommendations bear on their
policies and administrative practices.

Liberal use of tables and maps has lightened the task of
the reader. Some interpretations are implicit in the maps,
which are in clear and simple style; where included in the
written text they are for the most part well supported.

The recommendations are clear-cut, positive and divided:
(1) for immediate action; (2) for action as soon as possi-
ble—v—but with some obviously necessary delay; and (3) for
future action, subject to 'future review and confirmation.
Three recommendations are that; (1) all public recreation
services and facilities in St. Paul be put under the direction
and control of a single authority—preferably a board of
parks and recreation constituted by proper city charter
amendment; (2) the development of public recreation serv-
ices in the suburban areas he a oint undertaking of the mu-
nicipalities, the consolidated school districts, and the county
board of commissioners; (3) the basic planning unit for
public recreation be the neighborhood with population of
five to ten thousand living within a radius of one-half mile.

Specific proposals for location of recreation units have
been made in the light of redevelopment plans, highway
plans, and plans for expansion of school facilities.

Facilities to be developed by Ramsey County include the
large scale provisions such as golf courses, camps, large

parks, and beaches. Water supply and conservation, as well
as recreation, are objectives of a very ambitious plan.

Practical suggestions are made as to procedure for reali-
zation of recommendations both in public recreation and
in the voluntary agency fields. Formation of a special con-
tinuing committee with “authority to work out the proposals
of this study” is recommended. As a long term guide for
such a committee the “Summary” section concludes with
a clear and effective schedule keyed to a recreation planning
map—the master recreation plan for St. Paul.

Here is indeed a valuable addition to the recent succes-
sion of comprehensive recreation surveys of metropolitan
areas such as Los Angeles, Oakland, and Detroit. The re-
port could have used one more editorial and typographical
review. However, it is not too difficult to read and certainly
contains invaluable guide lines especially for the executive
or committee needing help in planning a metropolitan
survey.——E. DANA CAULKINS, Associate Consultant, Educa-
tion-Recreation Division, Health and Welfare Council of

Prison Recreation Check

A survey of recreation facilities and athletic activities in
ninety-six prisons in the United States, conducted by Leon-
ard W. Brumm, Jr., of the Michigan State House of Cor-
rection and Branch Prison, revealed the following:

o F orty-nine of the prisons had a full-time recreation or
athletic director and thirty others a part-time director;
seven had two or more full-time recreation workers. Less
than one-half of the recreation and athletic personnel had
a college background.

0 The fourteen most common activities, each of which was
reported by more than one-half of the prisons—ranked in
order according to the number reporting them— were
movies, radio, checkers, softball, horseshoes, dominoes, bas-
ketball, volleyball, baseball, Ping-pong, cards, boxing, foot-
ball, handball.

. At eighteen prisons, teams are permitted to go outside
the walls. The various activities in which prison teams com-
pete against outside teams are baseball, basketball, softball,
football, Ping-pong, chess, debating, track and field, wrest-
ling, soccer, weight lifting, rodeo, tennis, touch football,
and ice hockey.

o Fifty-nine of the prisons are maximum-security institu-
tions, but apparently the type of security maintained in a
prison has nothing to do with the scope or variety of the rec-
reation program, with one exception. Some of the most
security-minded are among those with the best programs.

Swimming Pool

Operation and
Maintenance

 

Accident Prevention

Thomas R. Kayser, age twenty, was electrocuted
on June 22, 1954 while assisting with the vacuum
cleaning of one of four outdoor city pools. He was
one of two lifeguards assigned to clean the pools in
the mornings before use by the public. He had been
using the broom part of the cleaner in the water with
a mask and air hose and had just switched jobs with
the guard who was moving the electric pump as nec-
essary. Tom had moved the pump about fifteen feet
when he called out “pull the plug” after which time
he doubled up and fell to the deck. Efforts by the
fire and police departments failed to revive him.

Later it was determined that one of the wires to the
pump had been pulled loose. The pump had been
checked and properly inspected by the park depart-
' ment electrician that morning before the guards had
started operating it. The park department then had
the General Electric safety engineer and several elec-
trical engineers study the accident and tell us how to
prevent such accidents in the future. Their recom-
mendations included: (1) be sure the pump is
grounded, (2) have rubber handles installed on the
pump, (3) install a chain to drag from the pump,
(4) install a switch near the handle, and (5) the
operator should be dry while using pump.

No negligence was determined in the death of the
lifeguard. It seems that the wire leading to the
pump was caught on a corner of the pool deck when it
was moved and caused a short when the wire pulled
loose from the clamp leading to the pump.

This accident has caused our park and recreation
departments to be especially aware of possibilities
and causes of accidents and we have now employed
a year-round safety director who, with a safety com-
mittee, trains and inspects the entire department con-
tinuously. We believe it is an inexpensive safe-

guard—MARTIN M. NADING, JR., Superintendent of
Recreation, Fort Wayne, Indiana.

The rapid increase in the construction of outdoor swim-
ming pools and beaches has created a demand for trained
personnel to operate and maintain them in a manner that
assures the health and safety of the bathers. In order to
assure the availability of such personnel, workshOps for pool
and beach operators have been conducted in many sections
of the country and under various auspices. At these work-
shops, papers are presented by local or state health authori-
ties, sanitary engineers, pool designers, and eXperienced pool
operators. Opportunity is also afforded for a discussion of
a variety of pool and beach problems.

The following materials were presented at three typical
training conferences. The first two topics were included in
the Metropolitan Area Swimming Pool Operators’ and Man-
agers” Short School conducted at the University of Mary-
land in May, 1955. A basic, an intermediate, and an ad-
vanced course were offered at the school in which many
state, county, and local agencies participated. One paper
was presented at the Short Course for Swimming Pool and
Bathing Beach Operators conducted by the League of Wis-
consin Municipalities and the Wisconsin State Board of
Health in early June, 1955, with the cooperation of several
other agencies.

All who are responsible for the operation and maintenance

of swimming pools will recognize the practical and valuable
nature of this material.

Pool Housekeeping and Management

Speaking at the Maryland school, Reinhart W. Koch, chief
of the division of sanitation of the Montgomery County
(Maryland) Health Department, offered the following sug-
gestions for pool housekeeping and management:

The pool patron is not satisfied with knowing only the
price of admission or the weather forecast. He wants to be
sure that he will be able to enjoy himself in a safe, clean,
and attractive pool, that the whole establishment is kept
neat and clean, and that he will be safe in his. person and

effects, often in spite of his own foolhardiness. Good pool
management can bring this about, for good management
invites the confidence and cooperation of the patron.

Management

1. Clear definition of authority, duties, and responsi-
bility is a must.
a. The manager is “boss” under broad directives issued
by superiors.
b. Employees are properly instructed in their functions
and are backed up by the manager.
c. Policies and procedures are put down in black and
white.
2. Enough qualified personnel is on hand and used effec-
tively.
3. Pool rules and regulations are made, posted, and en-

forced.

4. Manager makes “rounds” and supervises execution
of instructions.
5. Physical care of the establishment is routinized and
kept up. i
6. Complaints by patrons are courteously received and
corrections are made, if valid, or are rejected, with eXplana-
tion, if they are unjustified.
7. Supplies are watched carefully.
0:. Ordering schedules are set up.
I). Specifications are known.
c. Alternate sources are determined in advance.
8. Where pool use is heavy, admission schedules are
worked out (ointly with top management or board).

Operations

1. Aid to patrons.

0:. Clothes storage: lockers, baskets, and so on.

1). Checking of valuables: double signature.

0. Clean-up facilities: showers, hot water.

(1. Rented suits and towels: issued and returned over
separate counters; laundered with hot water and soap
and heat dried or treated with 1/1000 quaternary am-
monium compound for five minutes.

2. Traffic pattern.

a. Bathers only in immediate pool area.

b. Bathers enter pool area through showers.

0. Food located outside pool area.

3. Foot baths: only flow-through types to be used; sprays
for rinsing off sand and grass desirable.
4. Maintenance of pool area.

a. Pool skimmed and vacuum cleaned daily.

I). Trash picked up and walks hosed down where need-
ed—no ponding.

c. Diving boards treated with fungicide where cocoa
matting is used.

5. Maintenance of bathhouse.

a. Kept painted.

b. No excessive condensation—additional ventilation,
if needed.

0. Urinals, toilets, lavatories cleaned twice daily.

(I. Soap, paper towels, and toilet paper replaced.

e. Trash picked up and containers emptied.
1‘. Floors: non-slip, well drained, no duck boards, mop-

ped down at least three times daily with strongly alkaline
hot water and dried; fungicide optional—dry floors do
not spread foot infections.

Personal Regulations for Health and Safety ‘

1. All persons must obey the instructions of the lifeguard
and the manager.

2. No person may use the pool unless it is officially open
and the guards are on duty.

3. Admission to the pool is refused to all persons having
any skin disease, sore or inflamed eyes, cold, nasal or car
discharge, or any communicable disease. Persons with ex-
cessive sunburn, open sores, or bandages of any kind will
not be admitted.

4. All persons using the swimming pool must take a
cleansing shower bath, in the nude, using soap. After using
the toilet, bathers shall take a shower before returning to
the pool.

5. Bathers with long hair must wear bathing caps.

6. Running, rough play, and personal conduct endanger-
ing safety of self and others in any portion of this establish-
ment is prohibited.

7. Persons unable to demonstrate to the guards their
ability to swim are not permitted in deep water.

8. Persons in street shoes are not permitted on the pool
deck.

9. Glass, papers, food or drink are not permitted in the
immediate pool enclosure. Smoking is permitted only in
areas set aside for that purpose.

10. All refuse must be placed in containers provided for
such purpose.

11. Spitting, spouting of water, blowing the nose, and so
on, are not permitted in the pool. Persons having to ex-
pectorate must use the scum-trough provided for such
purpose.

Pool Record Keeping and Operation Reports

Another speaker at the Maryland School Was Charles
Snyder of the Maryland State Department of Health, who
submitted the following outline for keeping pool records:

Need for Maintaining Records of Operation

1. Records of pool Operation are necessary to show com-
pliance with rules and regulations of agencies charged by
law with regulatory powers over public bathing places.

2. In most states complete daily records of pool opera-
tion must be kept and, often, summaries of these records
submitted to health authorities on a prescribed form.

Reasons Accurate Records Are Desirable

1. Previous records will serve as a guide for present and
future operation.

2. Records may serve as an aid in solving operation diffi-
culties as they arise.

3. Records are particularly useful in familiarizing new
personnel with operating procedures, solution to operating
problems, and planning operating schedules.

4. Records are of great value in planning and designing
improvements. '

5. Operating records and reports are probably the strong-
est defensive evidence available in case of litigation because

129

of an accident’or other claim due to faulty operation.
6. Records provide means whereby the health department
can check on precautions taken to protect the health and

safety of bathers.

Honesty and Accuracy in Keeping Records

1. All records should be accurate; they are primarily for

the operator’s benefit.
2. Records that are not accurate are of little use.

Methods of Keeping Records and Preparing Reports

1. Every pool operator should be supplied with a log
book in which to record all items of the daily routine in con-
nection with operation, maintenance, repair, all tests made,
and, also, special events or non-routine occurrences.

2. Reports for submission to regulatory agencies should
be prepared on the furnished or prescribed form from the
data kept in'the log book.

3. Pool operators in Maryland are required by the state
board of health to keep a daily record of operation. Forms
are available for weekly reports to the state department of
health. Such reports are not compulsory.

4. Suggested items to be included in operating records.

a. Total number of persons using the pool.
. b. Number of persons of each sex using the pool.
0. The amount of new water added—estimated if not

metered.
d. The length of time the recirculating and filtering

system is in use.

e. The length of time the disinfecting equipment is in
use.
f. The time of back-washing each filter and how often.

g. The amount of each chemical added and the length
of time applied.

h. The time of cleaning of the bottom and side walls
of the pool.

i. The length of time in flushing-off floating material
on surface of pool water and when this is done.

1'. The results of all alkalinity and acidity tests (PH).

1:. The results of all excess chlorine tests.

I. The results of any other tests made on the pool water.

m. When bacteriological samples are collected and by
whom.

n. Turbidity or clearness of water (black disc visi-
bility) .

0. Air temperature.

p. Water temperature.

q. Weather conditions.

Operating Permits

1. Annual operating permit required in Maryland under
state board of health regulations for public swimming pools.
2. Issuance of permit based upon physical facilities avail-

able, bacteriological sampling record, and routine inspec-
tions by health department personnel.

How to Regulate Swimmers

Warner E. Bartram, director of pools and beaches, Mil-
waukee County Park Commission, was one of the speakers
at the Wisconsin short course. He reported having sent
questionnaires to several communities and found that all

130

 

regulated their pools in much the same way. He, therefore,
listed a group of rules that a swimmer might see listed along
the way as he enters the bathhouse and continues on into
the pool area. The following are the rules (not listed in rela-
tion to importance) :
1. Please use urinals and showers before entering pool.
2. Leave all valuables with management. Check in at

counter.
3. .No towel snapping allowed.
4. Use soap when taking showers.

5. Stop here for inspection.
6. Walk! Don’t run.

7. No eating or smoking allowed in the pool area.
8. Pushing or unnecessary roughness forbidden.
9. No swimmers in pool during rain or electrical storms.

A clean, light, well-maintained filter room at 3 Providence,
Rhode Island, pool conforms to the established regulations.

10. One person on diving board at one time.

11. Use sliding units cautiously, no standing on slides.

12. Dive only from diving boards or from designated
area.

13. No swimming accessories allowed in the pool area.

14. Don’t swim beyond your ability.

15. Don’t disturb lifeguards while on duty.

These fifteen “don’ts”, if properly enforced, will help
make your swimming place a more enjoyable spot.

Now, how will employees .at our'pools or beaches regulate
all these “don’ts”? In the first place, any rule must be en-
forced right from its very conception. We all realize that
it is rather hard to tell someone not to do a certain thing if
that person has been doing it for some time without ill effect.
Therefore, rules must be agreed upon before the season and
then properly carried out on the very first day of operation.

To enforce the use of toilets and showers, an attendant
should be stationed in the shower rooms. We have found
an oldér person at this station brings the best results. This
supervision, together with rigid inspection, will soon im-
press the swimmers that you mean business.

Checking the pool operation survey, I found that one pool
held the checkers in the bathhouse responsible for losses
from baskets. The procedure sounds interesting and I would

RECREATION

i

like more information about it. The question that rises in
my mind is: Who checks the swimmer’s basket? We have
found, in our beach and pool operation, that it is better to
discourage, as much as possible, the bringing of any valu-
ables, large sums of money, or good clothes to the swim-
ming place. There are various occasions where it is neces-
sary to check jewelry, money, or personal belongings of
value, and our procedure is to have the swimmer place the
items in an enveIOpe, sign it, and seal it. This is done in the
presence of the manager. When it is returned the person
opens the seal and package and checks the contents before
leaving the oflice. Sealing of the flap prevents any argument.

The location of the dressing rooms in relation to the
checkrooms determines the type of supervision. If the check-
room opens into the dressing room, the attendants there can
keep an eye on conduct inside the dressing area. Otherwise,
an attendant should be present within the enclosure.

A clean body is an essential factor in anyone’s life but
more especially in a swimming pool. Beaches are not too
much concerned with ordinary body oils or dirt and dust;
whereas, in a pool the filtration system is an important item

and the length of runs of the filter beds depends largely on,

the cleanliness of the persons using the pool. This dirt also
affects chlorination to a great degree. I believe we should
also start thinking about insisting on clean suits, although
the problem of inspection remains a factor to be considered.
In order that the body be clean we should insist on a nude
shower. This rule is carried out in most cases during nor-
mal times. I’m sure we can all realize there must be some
laxity shown, however, during rush periods. Inspection of
feet and clean bodies is still rigid and questionable ones
are sent back to the end of the line for additional washing.
One or two times of waiting twice as long makes the lax one
soon come to time.

I’ve mentioned “inspection” several times during my talk.
Let me explain the procedure. In our system we place one
attendant at each entrance to the pool to examine all swim-

mers. Each swimmer stops, places his feet on a rack in front

of the seated attendant, spreads his toes, shows the back of
his heels, and passes on if everything is clear and clean. Any
questionable cases of athlete’s foot is shown to the manager.
If there is still doubt, the person is asked to leave the pool
area and not to return without a doctor’s certificate. The
same is done with open sores on the body.

“No Running” warnings are usually painted on the walk-
ways or placed on walls where the patrons can easily see
them. Lifeguards, who police the walks, are always remind-
ing the Speeders of that regulation. Repeated offenses, of
course, bring more drastic punishment.

“No Eating or Smoking” signs are usually accepted, es-
pecially if the reason is posted along with the regulation.
The explanation of any rule is important. If people 'under-
stand the whys and wherefores of a posted rule, they are
more apt to appreciate the importance of it and will comply
without a lot of argument. I realize that there are always
some, however, who insist upon doing wrong because of
the rule. They must be dealt with in a more stern manner.

Unnecessary roughness can be handled only through good

MARCH 1956

 

supervision in the pool by lifeguards. They must be on con-
stant watch for horseplay on the walks as well as in the
water. Penalties for any infraction of this rule should be
dealt with in strong measure.

Swimming during a rain or electrical storm can be a seri-
ous mistake. It may mean the difference between life and

,death. Public education is the best solution of this problem,

and can be accomplished through posted reminders and
verbal reminders.

Diving only from designated areas is a must. This again
is a regulation which must be enforced by lifeguards. Diving
boards naturally indicate a diving place, but other approved
places, such as from a walk or wall, should be well marked.
The water depth also should be plainly marked. Too many
cracked heads can result from divers coming from all direc-
tions in any form or manner.

There might be a bit of controversy over the next state-
ment, but I am ready for constructive criticism or argu-
ment. I do not believe in swimming accessories. By that I
mean goggles, fins, floats, balls, rafts, kick-boards or other
items in this category. I realize a beach can be more lenient
in the use of these accessories because they can segregate
areas without too much trouble; while pools have a more
serious problem. Swimming “helps,”"however, can be a
detriment to the person using any one of several. Their aid
might help a swimmer into water much beyond his depth
and too far out so that the return becomes a problem. The
small confines of a pool area do not allow for many activities
other than swimming or sunbathing.

Common sense is lacking in many peOple, of all ages, but
especially in those who insist upon bothering a lifeguard
while he is on duty. No one can do anything efiiciently if he
is disturbed while trying to concentrate on doing a good
job. A guard’sresponsibility is a great one; and swimmers
must be made to realize that their unimportant question or
conversation might mean the loss of a life. Seconds count in
drownings and the public must be so educated.

In designing a bathhouse, the layout should be considered
from various angles. One of the most important in the regu-
lation of swimmers and the control of their conduct, short
routes from dressing rooms to pool, access to the conces-
sion stand only from the outside and not the pool side.

Pool Operation in 1912

In a 1912 issue of American City it was reported
that 72 drownings in the river occurred within the
limits of the city of Pittsburgh in 1911. The article
reports on the operating cost of a huge open swim-
ming pool in that city in 1912. The following items
accounted for the total seasonal cost of $1,750:

[[10 LATCH on to an old saying, “There

is more than one way to skin a cat,”
the.live-wire recreation department in
Twentynine Palms, California, is
proving that there are more ways than
one to finance recreation facilities.

When John M. Lewis, the recreation
director, assumed the task of guiding
the recreation activities in this high
desert community during the summer
of 1954- there was a pronounced need
for a' new and larger swimming pool.
One year later this initial requisite for
better recreation had been fulfilled.

A bond issue for $68,000 was passed
by a large majority on the eighteenth
of January; and the beautiful new pool,
with spacious decks and many unique
features, was in use by July, just six
months after the bond election. It is
now being enjoyed by the public and
the nearby elementary and high school
physical education classes. Over one
hundred youngsters have learned to
swim; there have been two outstanding
aquatic shows with several hundred
spectators filling the new bleachers;
a fashion show; and several dances on
the forty-foot-wide decks.

With this established as one of the
community’s strongest assets, Mr. Lew-
is, supported by an aggressive recrea-
tion board, looked toward hurdle num-
ber two: a gym-auditorium.

Twentynine Palms is a community of

approximately six thousand, and the
recreation district established by the
county of San Bernadino serves an area
with about twenty thousand persons, in-
cluding a Marine base. A gymnasium
or large public meeting accommodation
was greatly needed.

The challenge of how to finance the
gym has been solved by the adoption
of a lease-purchase plan which has re-
ceived the endorsement of the San Bern—
adino County Board of Supervisors.
This approval followed many months
of publicity, research, and public hear-
ings, and ofiicial architectural drawings
and specifications are near completion.

The Twentyniners will pay approxi—
mately three hundred dollars per month
rent and after a number of years the
building will belong to the county.
There will be no increase in taxation
or bonded indebtedness as the Twenty-
nine Palms Park, Recreation and Park-
way District budget was paying the

’equivalent of the monthly rental for oth-

er buildings for various activities.

This structure will be used for basket—
ball, badminton, volleyball, all kinds of
dancing, wrestling, acrobatics, crafts,
adult and youth drama groups and out-
side organizations, carnivals, band con-
certs, public gatherings, and meetings
of civic groups. A kitchen, portable
bleachers, locker rooms, and storage
space are all included.

Possibly the most unusual different
feature of the desert gym-auditorium
is the special stage that has been con-

ceived by the local recreation director.
This stage opens into the building as
per the conventional pattern but also
has a large door in the rear, opening the
stage for outdoor theatre use.

Project number three, and outstand-
ing on the community priority list, is
a golf course and country club. Al-
though, to the passerby, desert lands
appear endless and abundant, the local
real estate situation is somewhat differ-
ent. Climatically, Twentynine Palms..is
one of the healthiest places in which to
live, has little or no humidity, and the
2,500-foot elevation makes for very
comfortable year-round living. Con-
sequently, this gateway to the enchant-
ing Joshua Tree National Monument
presented a problem regarding the site
for such a golf course.

After months of meetings and negoti-
ations, research through the National
Golf Foundation and desert golf course
operators, a plan has been developed
and a five year program is under way.

Over one hundred acres of land and
a water supply of five hundred gallons
per day are needed for an eighteen-hole
course. Through the cooperation of a
large property owner who realizes that
the acreage surrounding a golf course
can be very lucrative, we have secured
a very low price on some highly desira-
ble lands Our new water district will
sell us water at a special rate, and our
approach is clear.

With a proposed expense of sixty

thousand dollars just to put in the nine-

hole course, which incidentally repre-
sents our first-year goal, an idea was
developed whereby, through coopera-
tion, the above figure could be substan-
tially lessened. This community facility
is another project handled initially by
the recreation department; and from
the research and deveIOpment a non-
profit corporation has evolved.

By means of advanced memberships,

the golf committee is well on its way
financially. The goal of two hundred
members at one hundred and fifty dol-
lars per year and ten lifetime members
at one thousand dollars are both well
in sight. The board of directors is com-
prised of men and women who are in
a position to either buy'materials whole-
sale or to render services. By the win-
ter of 1956 a nine-hole course should

be in operation. The second year calls
for a very nice clubhouse; the third
year, a pool and tennis courts; the
fourth year to round out special facili-
ties and equipment; and the final year
of the five-year plan will usher in the
other nine holes, making the oflicial
eighteen.

In summary, the pool was accom-

“plished by financing through a bond

issue passed in the district. The gym-
auditorium is being erected to recrea-
tion department specifications and
leased to the district on a lease-purchase
arrangement. And, finally, the non-
profit corporation made up of Twenty-
nine Palms residents is building a nine-
hole golf course using advance mem-
berships with a five-year program de-
signed to round out the necessary fea-
tures of a country club. '

Living in this picturesque community
is fun for all ages, the sheriff’s station
reports practically no delinquency and,
thanks to an ambitious and extremely
capable recreation department, the fu-
ture is bright with promise. I

PURPOSE OF GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR RECREATION

Graduate education for recreation has
expanded rapidly in the past two dec-
ades. This growth accompanied a sim-
ilar deve10pment both in the areas of
education in general and in the allied
fields of health education and physical
education. Because colleges and uni-
versities already engaged in teacher
preparation assumed major responsi-
bility for this development, the recrea-
tion curriculum . tends to reflect the
philosophy of these institutions.

Approximately thirty-five c o 1 le g e s
and universities offer graduate degrees
in recreation. In other words, over one-
half of all the institutions which offer
special preparation in recreation also
provide this graduate opportunity. The
fact that graduate education for recrea-
tion is new and in the experimental
stage makes it difficult to state what the
purpose of this preparation will be in
the future.

At the present time, however, the pur-
pose of graduate education for recrea-
tion appears fivefold. These factors de-
serve a brief analysis.

1. To conduct research. Originally
all graduate education was designed so
that such preparation provided an op-
portunity for the mature, highly se-
lected scholar to reach the acme of
academic achievement. This concept
stressed intellectualism which included
the ability to conduct research. Lo-
cating and defining a problem, organ-
izing and categorizing pertinent mate-
rials, determining the validity of vari-
ous factors, drawing sound conclusions,
and reporting the findings clearly and
effectively combine to make up this
ability to do research. Although this
concept is as old as graduate educa-

of education at Teacher’s College, Col-
umbia University. This article is taken
from a speech delivered at the National
Recreation Congress in Denver, 1955.

tion, it still remains a very important
focus of graduate preparation for rec-
reation.

Unfortunately, few graduate recrea-
tion students develop the ability to con-
duct research. In fact the inability of
recreation leaders to carry out effective
research looms as one of the outstand-
ing gaps in the recreation profession.

2. To apply research. Graduate study
in recreation. is designed to develop the
ability to utilize existing information to
help to solve the new problems which
arise. Because recreation cuts across
so many areas, it becomes almost man-
datory to apply research completed in
allied fields to related problems in rec-
reation. To first comprehend and to
then interpret these data form impor-

tant aspects of graduate instruction.

3. To develop scholarly leaders. The
development of intellectual leaders in
the recreation profession rests as an in-
dispensable function of graduate edu-
cation for recreation. This responsi-
bility focuses not only on preparing
leaders to advance recreation knowl-
edge and understanding but also to im-
prove life in the community. This con-
cept goes beyond pure intellectualism
and research; it relates to human wel-
fare. Graduate education, therefore,
concerns itself with providing eXperi-
ences for students which prepare them

to be leading citizens in the community
and nation.

4. To develop the ability to commu-
nicate. Teaching and leading do not
come naturally. Scholarly work and re-
search skills do not guarantee high ef-
ficiency in the art of communication.

Consequently, every opportunity must
be made available for students to gain

experience in communication. The
ability to write and speak clearly and
effectively serves the graduate student
well in his professional work. The true
professional. communicates the results

John Hutchinson

of his significant activities through pro-
fessional writings, work in professional
societies, reports to colleagues, instruc-
tion of students and leaders, and the

like.

5. To specialize in a particular area.
At the graduate level the student finds
the opportunity to develop a high de-
gree of competence in one aspect of the
total field of recreation. As the student
focuses on this narrowing process, the
problem of over-specialization often de-
velops. The present trend in graduate
education appears to be one that strikes
a balance between narrow specializa-
tion and a broad, well-rounded educa-
tion.

As graduate education for recreation
has been focused on this fivefold pur-
pose in the last few years, certain nega-
tive trends have become evident. Al-
though these trends may not exist in
every institution, it seems worthwhile
to call attention to a few, if for no other
purpose than for self-evaluation. In-
cluded among these negative forces are
the following:

1. The increase in the number of in-
stitutions offering graduate degrees in
recreation regardless of the needs.

2. The attempt to conduct a graduate
program of study without a sufficient
number of qualified graduate faculty
members.

3. Poor admission practices which
lead to raising and lowering admission
requirements to meet temporary condi-
tions caused by wars, depressions, and
other crises.

4. No real line of demarcation be-
tween undergraduate and graduate
preparation.

5. The addition of recreation to the
title of a course without changing the
content of the course.

6. The absence of provisions for
seminar-type courses and other oppor-
tunities for group discussion and the

RECREATION

 

exchange of ideas.

7. The lack of comprehensive library
resources.

In conclusion, it seems justifiable to
note that, regardless of a few negative
factors, graduate education for recrea-
tion has made commendable progress
in a few short years. The institutions
engaged in this process should continue

to focus on the live factors mentioned:
(1) conduct of research, (2) applica-
tion of research, (3) development of
scholarly leaders, (4) ability to com-

O Cortland Students,
Supervisors Meet

Junior and senior recreation educa-
tion majors at State Teachers College,
Cortland, New York, met with profes-
sional recreation leaders in the third
annual Field Work Supervisors’ Con-
ference late in the first semester. The
meeting introduced junior students to
their agency supervisors for the second
semester.

Some professional leaders traveled
more than five hundred miles for the
two-day conference. Executives and su-
pervisors from fourteen community rec-
reation programs were joined by
representatives of voluntary and. youth-
serving agencies, industry, rural soci-
ology, hospital and institutional recrea-
tion, and First Army Special Services.
About one hundred attended the series
of meetings.

Supervisors and students were
brought together to hear explanations
of the duties arid responsibilities of
each. Technical aspects of field work
training were discussed and clarified.
Richard S. Westgate, NRA district
representative, addressed the confer-
ence. Professional recreation leaders
observed students in class and at work.
A highlight of this portion was the dem-
onstration of Cortland’s unique course
in “Construction and Repair of Recrea-
tion Equipment.” Recreation and social
’ hours alsowere scheduled by Kenneth
Reynolds and Jo Kerst, student co-
chairmen.

Comments received both from stu-
dents and from professionals and fac-
ulty indicate that the two principal aims
of the conference—the indoctrination
of field-work students and their super-
visors into their coming responsibilities,
and the giving of a new and meaningful

experience in recreation to all attending
—werc met in full.

Q‘W ear/«mice

If it is possible to judge the success
of an operation by the number of staff
attending, then the record should read
“prognosis excellent” for the Second
Hospital Recreation Institute for the

Aged, Ill and Handicapped, co-spon-

sored by the National Recreation As-

sociation and New York University,
January 18-20. Three hundred and ten

persons, from nine Northeastern states,

attended.

The opening morning general session
stressed the problems of the aged per-

son and the contribution that recreation
can make to the ill and handicapped
senior citizen. Geneva Mathiasen, ex-
ecutive secretary of the National Com-
mittee on the Aging, National Social
Welfare Assembly, identified the live
greatest hazards which must be over-
come by the aged: (1) reduced income;

(2) likelihood of being forced to make

drastic changes at a time of life when

the person is least able to adjust; (3)

reduced physical vigor and the threat
of chronic illness; (4) increased unal-

located time, while the circle of con-
temporary friends and of relatives in-

evitably grows smaller; and (5) loss of

prestige and feeling of uselessness with-

out a compensating change in values.

Dr. Harold Meyer, University of
North Carolina, emphasized, “The sum
of the facts proves overwhelmingly that
we can live longer and that the span of
life may be even further lengthened.
While this is a thrilling achievement, it
is accompanied by a big question: How
will we live these years?”

That afternoon, Dr. Louis Linn, psy-
chiatrist at Mt. Sinai HOSpital in New
York City, gave a wonderful talk on
why we should not accept the term “se-
nile” without actually knowing that this
is the case from a medical standpoint
—in other words, an actual regression
of the brain. He said, “By and large,
the behavior of old people is an exag-
geration of life-long patterns.” He em-
phatically pointed out, “Recreation is
as much a necessity for mental health
as vitamins are for physical health. . . .
Emotional survival is not'possible with-
out the one, just as physical survival is

workshops concerning problems related
to special disabilities, as well as to rec-
reation problems in particular institu-
tions.

On Friday, Dr. Howard A. Rusk, di-
rector of the Institute of Physical Medi-
cine and Rehabilitation, NYU-Bellevue
Medical Center, New York City, out-
lined.a dynamic program for the aged.
One of many things he brought to our
attention was that today there are more
than 14,500,000 Americans past the age
of sixty-five. “You, in this new and ded-
icated branch of the recreation profes-
sion have a new and growing area to
serve———our ever-growing aged popula-
tion. Recreation is a fundamental ther-
apy for this group. Programing for the
aged varies little from the program for
others except in tempo and the common-
sense application of sound recreation
practice by the person working with
them.”

That afternoon we had two extremely
active panels concerned with meeting
community recreation obligations for
the non-institutionalized ill or handi-
capped senior citizens. Sarah Good-
heim, of the Division of Recreation,
Welfare Department, Kansas City,
pointed out the tremendous responsi-
bility of the community to the chron-
ically ill or handicapped person who is
not institutionalized: the handicapped
person unable to leave his home, and
the one able to come to a center. She
outlined a very impressive plan for
servicing both. Kansas is now in the
process of putting this plan into action,

and I’m sure Miss Goodheim will be de-

lighted to hear from any of those inter-
ested.

The last panel emphasized training
and utilizing volunteers to supplement
professional workers. Assemblyman
Bernard Austin of the New York State
Joint Legislative Committee on the
Aged challenged us with the necessity
of developing recreation interests in our
middle-aged Americans, helping them
to properly understand the vital role
recreation must play in what can only be
described as a leisure-time revolution
going on in our time. “Unfortunately,
today we have so many compulsive

not without the other.”

The afternoon closed with a panel
session on special recreation programs
for the aged, ill and handicapped out-
lining creative, educational, group and
Intra-group activities.

Fun Around The World

Frances W. Keene. The Seahorse
Press, Pelham, New York. Pp. 128.
$1.00.

Every now and then a bodk written
for children (this one for ages nine to
fourteen) should be grabbed by teach-
ers and recreation leaders, and used to
plan exciting and novel programs. This
is such a book.

Remember how long it took you to
look up material for an international
festival or party? Or to find some
games, or crafts, or stories, or foods
from other lands? Here they are——
from sixty countries, from A for Af-
ghanistan to Y for Yugoslavia, and
from every continent.

And when you order this book, ask
for a listing of the other Fun Books pub-
lished by Seahorse. They’re all good—
and inexpensive! — Virginia Mussel-

This publication points up the ele-
ments of hazards always present in any
form of recreation activity and was pre-
pared by the recreation department of

Newark public schools. When ordering,

Personnel Study

(Health, Welfare and
Group Work)

Conducted by the Jefferson County
Coordinating Council of Social Forces,
309 North 23rd Street, Birmingham 3,
Alabama. (Compiled by Dr. Howard
Harlan.) Pp. 48. $1.00.

A study of personnel policies and
practices and the characteristics of
agency personnel of forty-eight health,
, welfare, and group work-recreation
' agencies of Jefferson County. In addi-
tion to the agency questionnaires, 634
employees responded to questionnaires
dealing with their individual status.

Part I, dealing with policies and prac-
tices of the agencies, points out that
the typical agency in the county sched-

MARCH 1956

PUBLICATIONS .

ules a five-day work week of 371/2 hours.
Characteristics of the typical agency in-
clude such practices as follows: Over-

time work is frequent. Expenses are.

paid for attending professional confer-
ences. Annual leave of two weeks is
prevalent, although one month for the
executive director is common. Sick
leave of twelve days is allowed. Holi-
days with pay are New Year’s Day, In-
dependence Day, Labor Day, Thanks-
giving, and Christmas. The typical
agency permits employees time off dur-
ing their working day for educational
courses and permits time off once or
twice a year for attendance at educa-
tional institutes lasting one or two days.

Part 11 deals with the characteristics
of employees. The report reveals that
most of the professional employees have
been to college and over half of them
possess undergraduate degrees. Nearly
all of the executive-supervisors have
been to college and over sixty per cent
of them have degrees. In addition, al-
most half have had some graduate train-
ing and nearly one-quarter hold gradu-
ate degrees. Sixty per cent of the execu-
tive supervisors have had more than
ten years’ experience and about half
have been in the field twenty years or
more.

Salaries range to $10,500. Men in
each job category receive more than the
women. As education and experience
increase, salary tends to move upward
and the factors of sex and experience
appear to be more significant than age
or education.

The median salary for all profession -°

al workers participating in the study is
reported to be $3,659. The median sal-
ary for 112 executive-supervisory posi-
tions is reported to be $4.776.

Some of the generalizations point out
that although there are differences in
qualifications, the voluntary agencies
pay their professionals in the group-
work agencies $1,000 or more than pro—
fessionals receive in the welfare agen-
cies. Among the tax-supported agen-
cies the difference is only $200, but is
still to‘ the advantage of the group and
recreation employees. It is pointed out
that sixty per cent of the executive-su-
pervisors are college graduates and only
twenty per cent hold graduate degrees
which may indicate insufficient profes-
sional training. The study points out

further that if graduate work is to be
judged as the standard training, the fact
that only twenty-one per cent of the case
workers had any- graduate work may
cast some doubt on the adequacy of the
professional preparation of present em-

ployees—W. C. Sutherland, NRA Rec-

reation Personnel Service.

DYNAMICS OF GROUP ACTION

Make Your Staff Meetings Count! by
Daniel R. Davies and Kenneth F. Her-
rold. Arthur C. Croft Publications, New
London, Connecticut. Pp. 59. $2.50.

This is the second in a series of hand-
books under the general title, “The
Dynamics of Group Action.” The first
book in the series was Citizens’ Com-
mittees. The handbooks are designed
to give practical help on various aspects
of human relations which concern ad-
ministrators and board members in
school systems and other organizations.

The latest findings from the growing
body of research in this field are pre-
sented and the authors translate these
findings into practical recommenda-
tions and action. The chapter headings
give a cue to the content and include,
“Why Are Staff Meetings Such a Prob-

, lem ?” “Why Do Staff Meetings Count?”
“What Can You Do About Staff Meet-
ings?” “What Are Some Measures of
Effectiveness?” and “Where Can You
Go for More Help?” A self-study guide

for staff meetings presented on a two-
page spread helps the reader to see at

a glance some of the aspects of staff
meetings.

rold. Arthur C. Croft Publications, New
London, Connecticut. Pp. 45. $2.50.

series. Additional titles will be announc-
ed as they are released. This handbook
discusses the executive’s role in prob-
lem solving and presents guideposts for
solving problems. It deals with such
factors as who should take part in prob-
lem solving; and presents plans involv-
ing communications, observation and
analysis, problems of human behavior,
discussion, observation and evaluation.

This is a small 64-page pocket-size
guide for modern leaders. There are
five short chapters and each one con-
tains helpful information.

Leadership is explained briefly
through the transition of the prescien-
tific to the scientific era. The historic
sequence of leadership is about the same
as that of other authors and the chapters
on developing leaders on-the-job and in
workshops are clear and concise, al-
though brief. The methods of leader-
ship development and some of the re-
sources for leadership are identified.
The authors emphasize a third dimen-
sion for leadership training which con-
sists of training all members of a group
and not just the designated leaders to
perform leadership functions. This is
consistent with one of the newer defini-
tions of leadership, which indicates that
leadership is more a set of functions
than a personal role of a single exalted
leader.

Malcolm Knowles is administrative
coordinator of the Adult Education As-
sociation which publishes that excellent
magazine for leaders, Adult Leadership.
Mrs. Knowles has been an active leader
in church groups and civic organiza-
tions.

“I was pickin’
pansies

in Belleau Wood"

 

THEY WERE only a handful of dirty, hag-
gard Marines. Paralyzed, they hugged the
earth outside Lucy le Bocage as murderous
German fire poured at them. And then they
heard their little, middle-aged sergeant:

“Come on, you ---. -- . . . . . --!
Do you want to live forever?”

That yell, and the charge that followed,
made Sergeant Dan Daly famous. But he
wanted no glory. He already had two Medals
of Honor, one earned in Peking, the other
in the jungles of Haiti.

And when reporters asked about his
World War I decorations, he said: “I was
out in Belleau Wood pickin’ pansies for my
girl one day. And the officers said: ‘Let’s

No hero to himself, Dan Daly was a fear-
less and expert professional soldier—one of
a breed some folks don’t expect of a wealthy,
peaceful land like America. Yet America’s
ability to produce men like Daly is a more
important clue to her strength than all the
gold at Fort Knox.

For it is Americans by the millions that
make our nation great. And it is their price-

less strength that hacks our country’s Sav-
ings Bonds.
