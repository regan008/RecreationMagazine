MEASUREMENT and EVALUATION in PHYSICAL
HEALTH and RECREATION EDUCATION

This book may be used for both elementary and advanced courses
in measurement and evaluation—and as a measurement and eval-
uation reference book. It is so detailed and complete that it makes
the purchase of a work on tests and measurements unnecessary.
It also can be used as a text on statistics—and there is no other
dual purpose text and workbook combined in one book. One of
its most practical features is the use of the “Photo-code” tech-
nique on the presentation of individual tests and also the statisti-
cal procedures.

By SLEONARD A. LARSON and RACHAEL DUNAVEN YOCUM. 512
pages, 164 illustrations, charts and tables. PRICE, $5.00.

THE ORGANIZATION and ADMINISTRATION
of INTRAMURAL SPORTS

Considering many social, psychological and educational conno-
tations, this book presents the background of intramural sports.
It gives a good account of present practices and ideas that are
workable anid effective—and implications for future planning
Practical suggestions are included from all kinds of schools from
every part of the natibn and Canada.

By LOUIS E. MEANS. 2nd Ed. 462 pages, 240 illustrations. PRICE,
$5.75.

EDUCATION THROUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES

This book is unique in that it not only presents the activities that
should be included in the elementary school physical education
program, but clearly shows how the program can be organized
and conducted in the many school situations throughout the
country in which facilities, equipment, and available space often
affect the nature of the program.

The authors present in a practical and logical way the bases for
selecting activities, the fundamental principles underlying the
program, the objectives of a program, the desirable amount of
time to devote to the total program, and the numerous activities
and criteria for evaluating the activities.

By PATTRIC RUTH O'KEEFE and ANITA ALDRICH. 262 pages, 154
illustrations. PRICE, $4.50.

PHILOSOPHY of RECREATION and LEISURE

This book deals with the leisure-time activities of adolescents
and adults. Education as a process is discussed only as it lays
the foundation for a wide range of leisure pursuits. It is a study
of what men do with time made captive through the development
of the machine. It stresses the startling and disturbing fact that
the great masses of men are both ignorant and indifferent to the
debilitating power and influence of this new giant of commercial
mass communication in our midst.

By DR. JAY B. NASH. 222 pages. PRICE, $3.50.

EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOL CAMPING

Teacher education institutions will find in this book a text which
can be used in courses such as camping, curriculum, or teaching
methods, while it will also serve as a guide to the administrator
and classroom teacher who is in service in the school camp pro-
gram. The first five chapters offer information on the problems
in school camping and their solutions in specific cases, guidance
in planning for camp facilities, personnel, and program, and
patterns of administration and leadership training. Chapters 6-8
make the book unique in that they explain in detail the curricu-
lum in school camping and its importance. The last chapter
presents evaluation in a thorough and unusual way.

By HELEN MANLEY and-M. F. DRURY. 343 pages, illustrated.
PRICE, $4.50.

“Daddy,
lift me up. See the.

John W. Faust
angel.” For over

one hundred years in our family that
call has sounded on Christmas Eve. We
will hear it again this December 24 and
will lift up our nineteenth grandchild
to gaze, as generations have before him,
in starry-eyed wonder at the angel at
the top of the Christmas tree. For this
is not merely a silver angel. It is the
talisman, the magic symbol of all the
love and beauty, all the understanding
and selfless devotion, all the gaiety and
charm, the “living for the fun of it,”
the spirit of play, which are the glory of
the real family, “the crown of religion”
and the very essence of the Christmas
season “when glory shone around.”

Kleine Grossmutter, our great grand-
mother, brought the silver angel with
her from Austria in 1848 in her dower
trunk—with its handspun, handwoven
linens — accompanied by her seven
sons. Actually it is only nickle silver,
about six inches tall, but platinum is
lead in comparative value.

In this realm of the spirit we of the
recreation profession are singularly
fortunate. We touch people in their
most malleable, most plastic state——at
the time when they are free to choose
what they will to do. The burgeoning
of creative skills, physical prowess, na-
ture, music, drama expression are valid
signs of leadership in our chosen held.
But we have often said to any who
would listen that one -of the most im-

MR. FAUST is Middle Atlantic District
representative for the National Recrea-
tion Association.

portant criteria of a community recrea-
tion program is: does it enrich family
life? '

Isn’t it of transcendent importance
that we help people—families, individ-
uals——-to discover and create these spir-
itual talismen, these inner-sanctum
symbols in their lives? These small
things—events, happenings of no in-
trinsic value—have the magic power,
when seen or thought about, to restore
again, in a flash, the dimmed or lost
vision of the heights we would have
scaled at dawn, of the great plari we

laid out by which to build our lives.

This is a matter of more than tech-
niques, skills, professional know-how.
It is more in the realm of the Spirit. It
calls forth the dedication of the Hip-
pocratic Oath. It is the supreme hall-
mark of the true recreation‘ leader.

These symbols are infinite in variety.
The silver angel is but one of our own.
Let us illustrate: two Junes ago, after
much planning, we gathered twenty-
seven of our immediate clan for a cele-
bration. Chatting after dinner, one of
our six children came out with, “Didn’t-
we have fun though!”

For her, it was Thanksgiving and
Christmas; for.another, it was our trips
abroad in Manhattan; for one son, it
was our workbench creations; for ‘an-
other, our hshing trip to Henderson
Harbor; and, for all, our Friday play
nights.

When we were small boys we often
heard an urgent call from mother,
“Boys, come quickly!” We always knew
some wonder awaited. She might be
standing beside a west window calling
us to see the sunset; or it might be she

 

had uncovered spring’s hrst arbutus, or
found a rare pink orchid. 0n the days
when a spanking breeze blew across the
water, the sky azure blue and cumulus
clouds like myriads cut from the same
giant cookie cutter rimmed the whole
horizon, she was radiant and shared her
glory with us.

. She taught us through eyes, ears (or
sight, sound, fragrance, touch) the
prodigality of beauty surrounding us—
beauty in the grain of the pattern of
wood, the glory of autumn coloring, not
only Bach and Wagner but the different
tones of music played by the wind in
willow, oak, and pine, the good smell
of fresh turned earth, of shrubs and
flowers, the pleasure in the feel of cool
jade, saddle leather, hue textiles and
fabrics.

In the present, those days bring in
flash-review the pageant of all the
things which family meant to us.

Likewise we, as recreation leaders, as
parents, friends, or neighbors, have a
responsibility, a rare privilege to help
those we touch to discover, catch,
create, or rediscover such talismen of
the soul which in times of stress but-
tress our fortitude and, like the philos-
opher’s stone when touched, turn the
leaden skies of living into the sunset’s

“purest gold and rose.

May the spirit and all the eternal
verities—for which “The Man from
Nazareth” lived and (lied—suffuse, in.
spire, and lift your lives and work this

Christmas season and through the years
ahead. 1*?

) NEXT MONTH MARKS the 250th anni-
versary of the birth of Benjamin Frank-
lin (January 17th, 1706), and an inter-
national celebration is being promoted
by the Franklin Institute, Benjamin
Franklin Parkway at 20th, Philadel-
phia 3. The National Recreation Asso-
ciation is one of the sponsors of the pro-
gram. International Printing Week,
Printing Education Week and National
Thrift Week will be dedicated'to this
man’s long fight for freedom of the
press. Music Week will feature Frank-
lin’s songs. (Some few copies of these
are available free from National Music

) RECENT STATE ACTION. An act au-
thorizing counties, cities, and towns to
co-sponsor recreation services was pass-
ed by the Texas Legislature and signed
by the Governor on June 17. Texas rec-
reation officials hail this as one of the
most important developments in recent
years. For the first time, expenditures
from the general funds of counties are
authorized to pay salaries of recreation
personnel. The new bill also permits the
creation of recreation districts whereby
two.or more cities or towns may pro-
vide recreation services jointly.

Readers! You are invited to send letters for this page

to Editor, RECREATION, 8 West Eighth Street, New
Y or]: 11—--so that your ideas, opinions and attitudes
may be exchanged with others on the wide range of
subjects of concern to us all. H ere is your chance to
agree or disagree with the authors of our articles.

Physical Fitness

Sirs:

Upon receiving the latest NRA mem-
bership letter, I was very interested in
reading about the President’s confer-
ence which was to be held September
27-28 at Lowry Air F oree Base in Den-
ver and had to be postponed.

As to the purpose of the meeting in
relation to starting a youth fitness pro-
gram, it really inspires me to an utmost
degree, especially because next Mon-
day night we are meeting for the pur-
pose of starting a youth center here in
our little community. I am enclosing
a clipping showing that even in rural
communities a youth fitness program
can be started by individuals, on a vol-
unteer basis, if they are interested. I
think our program could be helpful for
men like C. C. Johnson Spink, the sport-
ing goods dealer, who is very interested
in developing a youth fitness program
for rural areas or average middle-in-
come neighborhoods.

Our present project is the building of
the “Playground of the Presidents.” On
each piece of play equipment, a sign is
mounted with the name of a president
-—-—-for example, George Washington,
year he was born, years he was presi-
dent, and year he died.

This sets an education standard for
the child, to become familiar with the
leaders of our country. It also makes
the child reSpeet the equipment when
it has to be gotten on a volunteer basis;
and it gives me an out when I support
something new, as I can ask persons
if they would be interested in helping
toward this project in memory of Abra-
ham Lincoln, and so on.

port, Washington.

City-School Cooperation
Sirs:
I have read the September issue of
RECREATION and notice the close tie-in

of recreation with the schools. I do not
agree with this trend of thought.

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

——The Editors.

I am just wondering if this is the
policy that the National Recreation As-
sociation is now following, as I notice
that there has been an increasing num-
ber of articles in our magazine regard-
ing recreation in our schools.

I believe I am safe in saying that
there are many professionals in the field
who do not agree with this type of
thinking and are now experiencing a
very poor relationship with the schools.
I would like to hear the other side of
this question discussed a little bit; in
other words, recreation as a community
obligation, such as police and fire de-
partments, and so on.

Schools, in many cases, have to ask
their communities to subsidize the sal-
aries of their coaches and many of their
teachers. If they are going to have to
do the same for a recreation worker,
they might as well put him under the
city recreation program.

The schools, in the past, have not
been very consistent with their athletic
policies, and I certainly would not want
to jeopardize recreation by putting it
in the hands of those not properly
trained for it. I can understand the feel-
ings of the educators on this problem;
they are interested in keeping this field
harnessed to the education program,
but I believe that these same educators
could contribute a lot more to recrea-
tion by turning over to the movement
any good ideas submitted to them in
theses, written by their students, instead
of keeping them secret. These ideas
could be acted upon by the recreation
field at large, and many instructive
ideas possibly would be developed
thereby.

I also believe that these educators
could help their students greatly by
bringing in men actually in the field of
recreation to talk to the students, an-
swering questions and submitting prac-
tical ideas, instead of just teaching the
students the theory of recreation. In
other words, the student would be well
rounded in recreation when he starts
working for a director.

RECREATION

I am very much disturbed by this
one-sided attitude which is being taken
on the subject.

SELWYN ORCUTT, Superintendent,
Recreation and Parks, Fayetteville,
North Carolina.

0 Repeatedly, through its publications,
conferences, field work, the National
Recreation Association has empha-
sized the fact that recreation is a dis-
tinct and essential function of local
government, and, in city after city, it
has opposed attempts to place the ad-
ministration of public recreation under
a local school system.—Ed.

Letter to Sid Lutzin

I was very interested in your chal-
lenging editorial in the September issue
of RECREATION, “Preventing Juvenile
Delinquency.”

You’re right, there seems to be a def-
inite “don’t-give-me-that-old-delinquen-
cy-prevention-stuff” attitude on the part
of many recreation directors, and in
looking over the “Goals and Philoso-
phy” of my own commission I see no
mention of delinquency prevention.
The nearest thing is that we are trying
“to seek out people who are shy, social-
ly unwanted, lonely, or unskilled, and
encourage them to participate in acti-
vities which meet their needs.” I’m not
sure we are doing that too well either.

I think you have a very good point
and I, for one, plan to bring it up for
discussion at our next commission
meeting.

CHARLES S. BRAND, Recreation Di-
rector, Painesville City Recreation.
Commission, Painesville, Ohio.

Recreation Education

Sirs:

Regarding “Recreation Education”
by Harlan Metcalf in your September
issue: “Recreation is what you do be-
cause you want to when you have the
spare time to do what you want to do”
is a good definition for recreation. This
kind of recreation, however, may be
good or bad. Recreation education, ed-
ucation for the worthy use of leisure,
carries this one step further and gets
across a better idea of what we, as rec-
reation personnel, are trying to do. ,

There is much discussion about how
to make sure that recreation education
points out the good path rather than
the bad path, so often lumped under the
term of “juvenile delinquency.”

‘ Being human beings, we will choose
quite naturally to do those things which
we can do well. We don’t want to get
shown up. We want to be accepted by
a society, any society, so we are natu-
rally drawn to the society dealing with
the line of least resistance—that which
we can do easily or well. As stated, this
can lead into poor company (or should

DECEMBER 1955

we say “socially unacceptable” com-
pany) or that which is accepted by our
peers.

It seems to me, therefore, that we
have quite clear signposts to follow. We
must educate our teachers in recreation
to show people how to learn various
skills in groups of their peers. We must
also educate our family groups to
search out those activities in which the
whole family can participate together.
If we can do these two things—admit-
tedly easier said than done—we will
have done away with much of the so-
cially unacceptable behavior making
the newslines today.

It is still true that the family which
“plays together; stays together” . . .
and any activity the entire family likes
to partake of would almost invariably
be acceptable to society. Broken homes
and the juvenile problem would seem to
be bred out of existence in the blossom-
ing of a new flower (recreation).

Such learning' would seem to indicate
a bit more emphasis on those sports and
activities which can be done with little
or no expense, with one person or
many, with coeducational groups, with
much or little training, and with or
without muscles. This latter qualifica-
tion would emphasize the fact that they
could be enjoyed throughout the rest
of the person’s life span, at least to a
greater or lesser degree depending upon
later physical well-being. While I am
not a champion of special sports over
others, I do think a core program in
any recreation department should in-
clude Sports to fit the above presented
qualifications, such as bowling, swim-
ming, dancing, golfing, and so on.

If these sports can be taught in age
classifications in a manner so that no
one feels self-consciousness, the indi-
viduals will naturally progress from be-
ginners to enthusiasts. Such enjoyable
results will later lead to learning an-
other skill, and eventually others. That
first interest is the one to capture. After,
it gets easier and easier, ust like getting
that first olive out of a bottle.

One example of such a program,
which is meeting with wonderful suc-
cess everywhere, is being tried in the
bowling classes sponsored by the Amer-
ican Junior Bowling Congress. Local
teachers are trained by state-authorized
congress instructors. Classes are given
for two weeks, then students try out
their skills and develop them through
twenty weeks of league bowling in their
own age groups. Classes are started at
six years of age and include all age
groups through seventeen. They are
divided into classes, six to eight, nine
to twelve, and thirteen to seventeen,
with the boys and girls taught separate-
ly. It seems to be an ideal setup, and
the idea could easily be adapted to other

sports, I should think.

This is the type thing which defines
real recreation education. And such
education can not be said to emanate
from only one source, the recreation
department. A picture of recreation ed-
ucation would have to look something
like a wheel—with the hub as recrea-
tion education. Leading to it would be
the spokes, and they would have to be
labeled: recreation department, school,
church, family. Since all these forces
mold the individual, why shouldn’t
they work together and get the best pos-
sible results?

WITHIN a few weeks now your home
will probably be graced with the

fragrance of a Christmas tree and
bright with wreaths of evergreen and
holly or sprigs of mistletoe. Your tree
will probably be bright with lights and
decorated with shiny glass balls and tin-
sel or possibly with ropes of p0pcorn
and cranberries. All of these things
have for years been to us part of the
“Spirit of Christmas.”

How did these things which are now
traditional become traditions? Even
before the Christian era the foundations
for our acceptance of Christmas sym-
bols were laid. Ancients believed that
eVergreens, were symbols of eternal life
and worshipped them as such. Each
tree was believed to be the home of a
god or goddess, and firs were especial-
1y revered because their always-green
needles proved to the superstitious peo-
ple that even the sun loved evergreens
best, as he never turned his face from
them to make them die. The ancient
poet Virgil describes the decoration of
a fir with gifts which were intended as
prayers to the god. Early Egyptians
also had a winter festival during which
they brought small palm trees into the
houses and decorated them.

458

/

Many times Martin Luther is given
credit for originating the Christmas
tree as such. It is said that he was walk-
ing through the hills one snowy Christ-
mas Eve and became so impressed with
the beauty of the stars shining through
the branches of snow-covered ever-
greens, that he immediately took home
a small tree and decorated it with can-
dles for his children. This story may
be fact or fiction—but it is true that
Germany was the real home of the
Christmas tree. From 1700 on, the dec-

orated tree was customary in Germany.
During the American Revolution, lone-
ly Hessian soldiers brought the custom
to our country. The idea was quickly
adapted here. Written records show its
wide acceptance by 1840. N o trimmings
were used at first, then gradually tufts
of cotton to represent snow, and strings
of popcorn and (cranberries were added
-—finally pictures of food, or actual
foods such as cookies or apples, were
used. It is easy to see how brightly
colored apples and oranges, which were
true luxury gifts in the early days,
could have been the forerunners of the
glass balls we use today.

One of the more familiar legends con-
cerning the Christmas tree is the tale
of Sir Wilfrid, an early Christian
knight, who sought to prove to his con-
verts that they had severed all connec-
tions with the pagan Druids. The Dru-
ids had especially worshipped oak
trees; so, on this day, Sir Wilfrid chose
a mighty oak and chopped it down to
show how the Druids’ pagan power had
been destroyed by Christianity. Ac-
cording to the legend, as the oak fell,
it split—and from its center sprang a

young fir. Sir Wilfrid thereupon (le-
clared the fir to be the symbol of Chris-

//

tianity, as its wood was the wood of
peace (since homes were built from it) ;
also, it pointed straight to Heaven, and
its needles were green, as with eternal
life. He commanded his followers,
“Gather about this tree, not in the wild-
wood but in your own home, for it will
shelter no deeds of blood, but shall be
surrounded with loving gifts and rites
of kindness.”

Another unusual legend as to how
trees came to be decorated is found in
both French and German folklore. Ac-
cording to this tale, a knight riding
through the forest on Christmas Eve
was suddenly amazed to see a huge fir
glittering with candles— some right
side up and some upside down. At the
top shone a brilliant light, which, as
he rode closer, became the outline of a
baby’s face. The knight rode quickly
home, telling everyone of his vision.
Peasants and wise men alike were baf-
fled, but, at last, a kindly old grand-
mother told the knight that the tree was
the tree of humanity—good souls rep-
resented by upright candles and bad
souls represented by the inverted can-
dles. The baby, of course, was the
Christ Child—watching over the entire
world on Christmas Eve— and, ex-
plained the grandmother, the whole
country was blessed by the light of such
trees during the holiday season.

These are but a few of the tales sur-
rounding the origin of our Christmas
tree. Whether it be legend or history
it is sent with the sincere wish that this
may be for you a truly merry Christmas
season.*

many years, Mr. Wrightson Christo-
pher,** says that although the tradi-
tions of Christmas are many and some
can be traced, most are lost in the dim
recesses of history. Many of the well-
known legends have been immortalized
in Christmas cards.

The story of St. Nicholas, patron
saint of children, is one rooted in fact.
A man named Nicholas was born in
Asia Minor back in the ninth or tenth
century, the son of a wealthy bishop
and a charitable mother. When his par-
ents died, Nicholas gave away every-
thing his parents left him. After his
death he was named as the patron saint
of children whom he particularly loved.

“I am often asked,” notes Mr. Christ-
opher, “whether homes all over the
world have Christmas trees. The an-
swer is no. It is the Christmas crib
which is more widely known as a sym-
bol. It is the creche in France, the na-
cimiento in Spain, and the Krippe in
Germany. In many European countries
the crib is carried through the streets
by groups of singing children and is a
feature in many homes during the
Christmas holidays ust as the tree is in
the Northern European countries and
here.”

Among the ancient legends of Christ-
mas is that of the Christmas candle. It
tells of a shoemaker who lived in a cot-
tage on the edge of a village. Although
a poor man, he placed his candle in the
window each night to guide travelers.
Despite wars and hardships and illness
his light never wavered. This inspired
the villagers and at the Christmas sea-
son nearly every villager placed a can-
dle in his window. The custom grew and
. became universal.

Another undying tale is the legend
of the Christmas rose. A little shepherd-
ess watching from afar wept because
she had no gifts to offer the Christ
Child. As her tears fell to the ground,
flowers sprang up. These the child
gathered and hastened to bring to the
infant Jesus to add to the gifts brought
by the Wise Men of gold, frankincense,
and myrrh.

DECEMBER 1955

There is an interesting German leg-
end which explains the origin of the
pine cone, widely used at Christmas
time. This tells of a poor woman climb-
ing a mountain .to pick up pine cones
for fuel. She was approached by an elf
who told her to “take only the cones
under this tree.” The woman picked

up the cones indicated, and when she
arrived home she found that they had
all turned to pure silver. Thus, the sil-
ver pine cone which we know today.
One legend has it that when Christ
was born all the trees burst into blos-
som and bore fruit. Birds sang and all
the forest was transformed into a magic

garden. There was sound of bells on
the night air and many angels singing?

 

Below, Saint Lucia, with crown of candles on a wire vegetable frame,
sits beside the Jul-Dacha and a Christmas tree trimmed with wheat
stars and small Scandanavian flags. All this was part of a Norwegian
Christmas celebration put on by the San Francisco Recreation and Park
Department’s UNESCO program directed by Aileen G. Jones. The Jul-
Doeka, traditional Christmas symbol in Norway, was made out of rafiia
over a wooden frame padded with packing. The wheat stars were made
of toothpieks glued together and tied with colored cord. For a period
of eight or ten weeks, the children learn how to play the games, sing
the songs, dance the dances, and make simple handcraft articles repre-
sentative of other nations; after which a program is presented for par-
ents and friends. Norway was the first country to be studied in this
fashion. The children were enchanted by the customs and folklore.

B OUND for the Mile-High City, the
plane came down through the snow
clouds and taxied across the field to the
air terminal. As delegates to the 37th
National Recreation Congress disem-
barked, they were met by a delegation
of girls from the city recreation depart—
ment, who held aloft a large “Welcome”
sign. They, appropriately, brought a
carnation for each visitor’s buttonhole
-—-for Denver is the carnation capitol of
the nation. This was a first sample of
the cordiality of the Denverites which
extended throughout the week. The
local arrangements committee, the rec-
reation department, the Colorado Rec-
reation Society, volunteer bureau, and
other local organizations did an out-
standing job of helping Congress ma-
chinery to click along smoothly. Their
friendly faces were everywhere and
many of them could be easily identified
by their Wrestern dress.

From a first glance at the thronged
lobby of the Shirley-Savoy, headquar-
ters hotel, it appeared that attendance
would be good. It was! Twelve hun-
dred and fifty delegates registered.

They had come to Colorado from forty-
seven states, Canada, Hawaii, Alaska,
the Canal Zone, and six foreign coun-
tries-——-Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Germany,
the Netherlands, Okinawa, and Brazil.
Every meeting during the week was
well-attended, and the watchword of the
entire Congress seemed to be “partici-
pation.” Delegates threw themselves in-
to the discussions with a noticeable ar-
dor and lack of self-consciousness. They
really got things done!

Letters from those who attended are
now coming into the NationaLRecrea-
tion Association and contain interesting

comments. “A tremendous wealth of

-information was given out by the panels

at the meetings I attended,” writes an
executive from New Jersey; while from
a recreation director in Indiana, “The
Denver meeting was, in my opinion, a
refreshing deviation and as interesting
a congress as we have had in nine years.
Why? I have gathered from colleagues
that the pleasant congeniality and in-
formal approacll was the ‘gilnliiick’.”
The use of three hotels, Shirley-Sa-
voy, Cosmopolitan, and Brown Palace.
did not seem to bother anyone. The
weather miraculously cleared on the

The only mother-daughter team in recreation today took an active part: Mrs.
Margaret B. Smith, director, children’s programs, Detention Home, Roanoke,
Va., and Shirley Smith, assistant superintendent of recreation, Petersburg; Va.

first day, and the short walk from one
to another in the warm Colorado sun
proved to be a refreshing break between
meetings; and strangely enough, all ses-
sions started more promptly than has
sometimes been the case in other years.

Underlying the business of the week
was a concern for the illness of Presi-
dent Eisenhower at the nearby Fitz-
simons Army Hospital. At the conven-
ing session, Joseph Prendergast, execu-
tive director of the National Recreation
Association, re'ad Mr. Eisenhower’s let-
ter to the Congress (see page 475) and
dedicated the 37th national meeting to
the nation’s President, “a great states-
man, friend, and recreationist.” The
invocation, given by the Reverend Har-
vey W. Hollis, executive secretary of
the Denver Area Council of the Churches
of Christ, led off with a prayer for Mr.

Eisenhower’s recovery.

Denver residents had been called up-
on to give “proper recognition” to the
recreation meetings, following a procla-
mation of “Recreation Week,”by Mayor
Will F. Nicholson in recognition of the
National Recreation Congress, the a11-
nual meeting of the American Recrea-
tion Society which preceded it, and
President Eisenhower’s special confer“-
ence on physical fitness—uwhich, unfor-
tunately, had to be cancelled. Experts
from the Congress addressed more than
two thousand business and professional
men in various service club meetings

during the week (see page 488).

Work and play were one and the
same thing during the entire Congress
and added emphasis to the remark of
Dr. Albert S. Raubenheimer, educa-
tional vice-president of the University
of Southern California, that “work and
recreation should not be regarded as
two separate things.”1

RECREATION

 

The 37th National Recreation Congress Stun;

Among The Guests

Civic ‘leaders and volunteers played
their usual prominent part in the pro-
gram. Many members of recreation
boards and commissions were present—
those from the National Recreation As-
sociation Board of Directors, Mrs. Paul
Gallagher of Omaha and Mrs. Rollin
Brown of California, chaired several
general sessions.

Delegates included t0p recreation
executives and program leaders from all
over the country, recreation specialists
and trained leaders from all govern-
ment levels, federal, state, and munici-
pal, from hospitals, social work agen-
cies, correctional institutions, churches,
schools, business and industry, the
armed forces, and from other lands.

A few among the many distinguished

‘guests and specialists other than those
scheduled to address general meetings
were: Dr. Morton Bard, research clini-
cal psychologist, Memorial Center for
Cancer and Allied Diseases, New York
City, whose excellent talk to the hosPital
recreation section of the Congress on
“The Role of Recreation in Relieving
the Anxieties of Patients” iwill be pub-
lished in the January 1956 issue of
RECREATION; Donald H. Goff, chief,
Bureau of Classification and Education,
Department of Institutions and Agen-
cies, Trenton, New Jersey, who served
on the panel of the meeting on “The
Function of Recreation in Correctional
Institutions”; Theodore Soja, Juvenile
Court, Denver, who chaired the “Work-
shop for Recreation Leaders in Institu-
tions for Adolescent Offenders”; C. C-
Bream, Jr., chief, Recreation Division,
Special Services, Veterans Administra-
tion, Washington, who chaired the hos-
pital recreation clinic on “What’s Your
Problem”; and ever so many others.

Trends

All attending the Congress were talk-
ing about today’s big problems; auto-
mation; increase of leisure; the urgent

DECEMBER 1955

need for more land for recreation pur-
poses; the stresses and strains of today’s
culture, which are crowding our hospi-
tals for the mentally ill; a relaxation of
respect for law and discipline, resulting
in juvenile delinquency, vandalism and
crime; the rapidly growing fringe
areas, with the influx of these people
into cities to use municipal recreation
facilities. In relation to this last prob-
lem, it was discovered that half of the
attendance at each meeting on rural rec-
reation was made up of representatives
from large cities.

Among Regular Services

All regular Congress services were

. located in the Shirley-Savoy. The dis-

plays of commercial recreation products
utilized every bit of space in the three
rooms set aside for them. Exhibitors
were helpful in advising‘on equipment
problems.

A report from the job mart, which
was thronged as always, states that the
people with vacancies to fill outnum-
bered those looking for jobs. 0n the
whole, salaries being offered were still
lower than they should be. Air Force,
Army, and Red Cross recruiters seeking

civilian recreation workers also were
stationed at the Shirley-Savoy.

The press room was one of the nerve

-centers of the Congress. Press coverage

was good, even though press wires and
reporters were tied Up in connection
with President Eisenhower’s illness.
Many radio and television interviews
were arranged for delegates.

Bibliographies of articles on Con-
gress topics, which have appeared in .
RECREATION magazine through the last
few years, were again distributed in the
discussion sessions, and collected sets 2

consultation center.

With its bright display of NRA pub-
lications, the consultation center was
busy again, making appointments and
filling orders and requests for published
materials. There seems to be some
question regarding the title of this cen-
ter for another year. A few delegates
thought the present title unclear or con-
fusing. Any suggestions? *

New This Year

I. A reporter assigned to cover each
meeting for The Scoreboard. This daily
newsheet came into its own, and did a
good job as a replacement for the
“Rough Draft” of previous years. Re-
porters turned in their reports immedi-
ately, for use in the next day’s issue.
With the addition of announcements
and other news items, this publication
presented a nearly complete coverage
of the Congress in capsule form. Many
delegates took home a collected set, to
be used in their reports.

2. A morning convening session. The'

Congress was oflicially opened by Jo-
seph Prendergast at a general session
on the first day, Tuesday, at 10 A.M.

3. The services of an official photog-
rapher for the Congress were contrib-
uted by the Nehi Corporation, manu-
‘ facturers of Royal Crown Cola, and
were greatly appreciated. His pictures
appear with this report and with the
picture story on pages 475—477.

Special Conferences and Meetings

The all-day conferences —Adminis-
tration Problems of Chief Executives,
Recreation for Business and Industrial
Workers, Recreation in Correctional
Institutions, Recreation in Hospitals,
Town-Country Recreation—took place
on Tuesday.

All NRA national advisory commit-
tees held meetings at some time or other
during the week. The National Advi-
sory Council met at dinner on Tuesday
and again at breakfast on Thursday.
Luncheons included: Red Cross group
at Fitzsimons Hospital; separate ones
for various state groups throughout the
week; one for National Advisory Com-
mittee on Defense Related Services.
Pre-session conferences of panel mem-
bers took place at breakfast or lunch.
The Michigan Recreation Society held
their annual “Wassail” party. The NR-l.
group, composed of those delegates who
traveled together to the Seattle Con-
gress on the special tour via the North-
ern Pacific Railway {National Recrea-
tion Train #1), held their third re-
union at breakfast. They voted to give
a tea at the Philadelphia Congress next
year, to which each member will bring
one international delegate.

On Thursday afternoon, Arthur Wil-
liams, assistant to the executive direc-

tor, National Recreation Association.
gave a reception for Brigadier General
Richard H. Carmichael, USAF. That
evening Mr. Prendergast gave a special
dinner for the presidents of state so-
cieties and associations; and Mrs. Paul
Gallagher gave a dinner for Edgar An-
sel Mowrer, journalist, commentator
and guest speaker of the evening.

\Vives’ Pro gram

Denver hosts Welcomed Congress
wives with plans that made their hard-
working husbands gnash their teeth in
envy. First, there was a luncheon at
the Top of the Park restaurant in the
Park Lane Hotel, Where they fully en-
joyed its beautiful View of the moun-
tains. Then a trip called “The Chero-
kee Trail” took them by bus through the
nearby mountain parks to Central City
—scene of old-time mining days ' re-

 

turning through Boulder and the cam-
pus of the University of Colorado. On
Thursday morning, another “bus par-
ty” gave them the opportunity to see

spots of historic interest; and, of‘

course, they joined Congress activities
in the evenings.

Demonstrations and Workshops

The demonstration of creative drama
on Tuesday afternoon drew executives
as well as program leaders. John P.
DePuglio of the Children’s Playhouse,
Junior Entertainment, Inc., University
of Denver, brought a large group of
local children with him to help in show-
ing the steps in such a program.

At the bowling clinic, on Wednesday,
the bowling lanes were filled With active
participants, while Milton Raymer and
Ed Hoey of the American Junior Bowl-
ing Congress instructed in the tech-
niques of teaching bowling.

The puppetry demonstration that
evening was outstanding and attracted
a large audience. Put on by the Denver
Puppetry Guild, which had erected two
puppet theatres, the program was in-
troduced by Mrs. Lois Hurt, president
of the guild, with the assistance of her
daughter and of “Mrs. Zilchgardner”
—a humorous gourd puppet created by
Mrs. Mary Pauline Steele. It included a
display of various types of puppets and
inarionettes, covered the use of shadow
puppets, hand puppets, marionettes,
and the making of them. Several brief

shows were. presented, as well as a spe-
cial hand-puppet performance illus-
trating traffic safety rules, by the Den-
ver Police Department. Among the ex-
hibits were puppets made by Denver
school children and scenes from slides
and motion pictures of the operas cre-
ated by the Century Marionette Guild
with the assistance of young people of
high-school and college age.

For the demonstration of recreation
for the handicapped, on Thursday, Mrs.
Morris H. Pomeroy, director and found-
er of the Recreation Center for the
Handicapped, San Francisco, brought
a fascinating display of pictures, as well
as craft projects, and games especially
made for the center by handicapped
participants, or by other organizations.
The work being done there is amazing.
( See “Recreation Center for the Cere-
bral Palsied,” RECREATION, April,
1954.)

The arts and crafts workshops that
same morning and afternoon were led
by Lester Griswold, craftsman from
Colorado Springs. They literally
swarmed with people undertaking all
sorts of craft projects.

General Sessions

These were held morning and eve-
ning, when eitperts who addressed the
assembled Congress prescnted,a broad
look at the forces which are shaping the
future of the recreation field.

The convening session, on Tuesday

RECREATION

 

morning, started off with singing led by
the fabulous and entertaining Robert
(Bob)
Denver, who was in charge of music for
other sessions during the week. (See
“Music as Recreation in the Mile-High
City,” by Robert Smith, RECREATION,
May 1955.)

Joseph Prendergast chaired the ses-

Smith, music coordinator in

sion, welcomed delegates, and paid
tribute to previous Congresses, dating
from 1907. He introduced members of
the 1955 Congress advisory committee
sitting on the platform, and called upon
J. Earl (Curly) Schlupp, director of
recreation in Denver, to present mem-
bers of the local arrangements commit—
tee, the Colorado Recreation Society,
and the Denver recreation department
staff.

Mr. Prendergast congratulated the
American Recreation Society on its
1955 annual meeting, and pledged his
support for a mature, cooperative re-
lationship, between the society and the
National Recreation Association, “in a
way which will be best for the national
recreation movement and the people of
America.” Greetings were extended to
delegates from Governor Edwin C.
Johnson, who was ill and unable to at-
tend, by Lieutenant-Governor Stephen
L. R. McNichols, and from Mayor Nich-
olson, who was in Washington, by
Willard N. Greim, who, as of January

1, 1956, will head the new Denver Rec:

reation and Parks Department under its
new charter amendment.

The speaker of the morning, Harlow
O. Whittemore, head of the department
of landscape architecture and planning,
University of Michigan, who spoke on
“Acquiring and Preserving Open
Spaces for Recreation,” urged a reap-
praisal of the Open-space needs of mu-
nicipalities for recreation use. 3

On Tuesday evening, delegates were
treated to beautiful selections by the
Denver Municipal Chorus under the di-
rection of Bob Smith. Mrs. Rollin
Brown substituted for Henry W. Meers
of Chicago as chairman of the meeting;
Thomas E. Rivers, secretary of the C011-
gress, who is now abroad arranging for
next year’s international congress,
greeted delegates via a recording; and
Dr. Raubenheimer spoke on “Creative

Aspects of Our Recreation Programs.”
He suggested a critical appraisal of rec-
reation activities, saying that recreation
is not just something to keep people
busy in idle hours, not just an escape
from boredom—it should contribute to
fulfilment of individual potentialities. “

Dr. Charles B. Hershey, Colorado
Springs Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion, chaired the third general session
on Wednesday morning. Awards for
the Sixth Army Service Club Competi-
tion were presented by Virginia Mus-
selman, NRA Program Service, and
were received in behalf of the winners
by Hazel H. Donner, staff service club
director, Sixth Army Headquarters.
(See page 488 for list of winners.) The
program which won first placc will ap-
pear in the January 1956 issue of REC-
REATION. Others will follow in future
issues of the magazine.

Both speakers of the session spoke on
“A Bold Program for Recreation in the
Future.” Brigadier General Carmichael
appealed to recreation leaders to help
servicemen and their families to par-
ticipate in community life, to become an
integral part of it. '

George Hjelte, general manager of
the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks

Department, called for support for the

ganization reaching into every village
and neighborhood is necessary, in order
to provide the benefits of recreation and
the opportunity for growth through
play to every child and to every citi-

zen.” 3

Mrs. Paul Gallagher chaired the

Thursday evening meeting. A lively
singing session was thoroughly enjoyed
by everybody, led by Dr. Frederick
Hall, Southern University, Baton
Rouge, Louisiana. Dr. Hall is remem-
bered from the St. Louis Congress last
year for his ability to get people to sing.

Edgar Ansel Mowrer was the chal-
lenging speaker of the evening. His
topic was “Recreation for What?” (See
condensation of his talk on page 466.)

As the surprise of the evening, Mrs.
Joseph Prendergast and Fredda Sieve
treated the audience to a beautiful two-
piano concert.

At the closing session Friday, Mrs.
Gallagher again acted as chairman. An
unexpected addition to the planned pro-
gram was a presentation of awards, in
the form of attractive plates, to each
staff member of the National Recrea-
tion Association and to the board mem-
bers present, by Keith A. Macdonald,
executive director of the Greater Val-
lejo (California) Recreation District.
The plates, made and individually in-
scribed by the craft groups in Vallejo,
were accepted in behalf of the staff by
Charles E. Reed, NRA Field Depart-
ment.

The speakers’ platform was shared
by six old-timers in the recreation field
—K. Mark Cowen, superintendent of
parks and recreation, Elkhart, Indiana;
Willard N. Greim, assistant manager of
improvements and parks, Denver; Er-
nest W. Johnson, consultant in public
recreation, St. Paul, Minnesota; Na-
than L. Mallison, recreation superin-

tendent of Jacksonville, Florida; F. S.

of the Union County (New Jersey) Rec-
reation Commission; and Anna S. Phe-
rigo, executive director, Board of Park
Commissioners, Lexington, Kentucky
————all of whom spoke on “Looking Back-

ward — and Ahead.” They referred

again and again to automation and the
jet age and the impact of these on the
recreation movement.

“With all the advancements in our
physical living,” commented Mr. Cow-
en, “it is interesting to note that the
basic principles involved in living with
our neighbor have not changed a bit

Since recreation can bring that
quality of life which enables one to live
abundantly and to share with others.
it is one of the growing sinews of pres-
ent day society.”

Mr. Mallison predicted that “recrea-
tion departments will shortly find a
need to have on their staffs a recreation
counselor to aid hobby groups in their
organizational period and to advise in-
dividuals as to how to get more out of
life physically and mentally.”

Miss Pherigo contributed her inimi-
table faith in the future, her love of peo-
ple, and her own sincerity. “Change
is a part of the joy of living,” she said,
“but it takes part of the old with part
of the new to keep you strong, and rec-
reation going.”

Discussion Sessions

Many of the fifty-two discussion ses-
sions and workshops were rich in sub-
stance this year. By all means get a
copy of the 1955 Congress Proceedings"
and look them over. Outside expert con-
sultants were brought into a number of
them and this was highly endorsed by
the delegates who were present.

Fun

Interesting activities throughout the
week led up to the grand climax on Fri-
day. Immediately following the general
session on the first evening, the floor
was cleared for square dancing. Some
of Denver’s outstanding callers were on
hand. The music was good; and the
session ended as usual with a group
singing around the piano with NRA’s
Anne Livingston playing.

On Wednesday afternoon a special
tour took off for a look at Bonfils Me-

i-

morial Theatre, one of the most out—
standing community theatres in the
world. Miss Helen Bonfils was ’present
to greet the group, and a personally
conducted tour through the building
followed.

Social dancing was scheduled after
the evening session on Thursday, and
was the only affair which might be
termed “dress-up”——for on Friday the
Buffalo Bar-B-Q in Red Rocks Moun-
tain Park replaced the usual annual
banquet. On that last day twelve buses
filled with delegates in a holiday mood
toured points of interest and ended at
Red Rocks at supper time.

As the different parties met at the
barbecue rendezvous the sun was set-
ting over the canyon below the terrace
where the serving was to take place. It
grows cool quickly in the mountains
and coats were donned as the long line
of delegates (460) passed before the
whitecapped chefs at their ovens and
received plates piled high with buffalo
meat or fish, steaming macaroni and
cheese, salad, fruit. other delicacies.
and coffee.

When it was time to go higher up, to
the Theatre of the Red Rocks, where
the recreation department of the City

and County of Denver were presenting

“Colorado,” the Denver show—some
piled into the buses, and some walked.

The first view of the theatre-———with
its towering red-rock sides, its seats for
twelve thousand spectators, its huge
stage far below, the sky as a roof, and
the twinkling lights of Denver spread
out in the distance—was spectacular.

Appropriately, the Denver Municipal
Band, conducted by Everett Sachs,
started the program (music provided
through the cooperation of Local 20
of the American Federation of Musi-
cians) . Although large, the band looked
small on the enormous stage; but every
tone of the music could be heard in any
spot in the theatre. Selections included
many old favorites; and especially
moving was “America the Beautiful,”
which was written by Katharine Lee
Bates after a visit to the Pikes Peak
region.

The production which followed was
in excellent taste, and told the story of
Colorado from the time when the great
rocks were first tossed up by glaciers

in the ice age, through the settling of
the Spaniards, the arrival of the Indi-
ans, the miners in the Gold Rush, to the
days of the early cowboys of the West.
The backdrOp of the stage is another
giant red rock; and in a startling and
effective moment during the Indian
dance (beautifully performed by Boy
Scout Troop #65, St. Dominics
Church) a spotlight picked out an In-
dian figure on top of it, outlined against
the sky. (How did he get there in the
darkness? See page 488.) The square
dancing of the miners, the music of the
fiddlers, the campfire singing of the
cowboys—all were excellent.

Officially the Congress was over. But
a substantial part of the crowd lingered
for the trip to Colorado Springs, co-
sponsored by the Colorado Recreation
Society and the Colorado Springs Parks
and Recreation Department. Again
crowded buses left the hotel with one
hundred people, this time at 7:30 A.M.,
for a day’s trip. It was a beautiful morn-
ing, and the Rocky Mountains, with
Pikes Peak towering in the distance,
were visible all the way through the
ranching country. At 9:15 A.M., the
party rolled through the streets of Colo-
rado Springs (where every tree has
been planted by man) to the city audi-
torium where the 'recreation depart-
ment, hosts for the day, served dough-
nuts and coffee. This Was actually the
start of the tour which included: a stop
at the famous Broadmoor Hotel, with
time to stroll about, visit the Ice Palace
to watch figure skating; a drive up
North Cheyenne Canon, where the buses
had trouble making the sharp hairpin
turns, and past the Helen Hunt Falls,
named for the author of Ramona who
came there for inspiration. The Way
down led over the Gold Camp Road—
an old railroad bed, through several
parks and playgrounds, to the Garden

of the Gods for lunch at the Chuck
Wagon Dinner area. Delicious boxed
lunches were served by the Colorado
Springs Parks and Recreation Depart-
ment, and the buses loaded for the re-
turn journey.

As the group finally disbanded in
Denver, many delegates — with grati-

tude to their hosts—were secretly plan-
ning to come back to Colorado for a
longer visit . . . someday. ‘3’

Preserving Open Spaces

About the year 1923 the National
Recreation Association made a study of
the open space needs of municipalities
for recreation use, and concluded-that
there should be ten acres of park and
playground space for each one thou-
sand people in the city.

This figure is still being cited in
books, articles and speeches. But, many
things have happened since then, and I
want to propose to you that the Na-
tional Recreation Congress inaugurate
a review of the area figures and stand-
ards. You know the happenings: (1)
the big increase in population, the larg-
est part in suburban areas; (2) tre-
mendous expansion from central cities
into suburbs frequently at some dis-
tance; (3) ease of travel by family car
to seek more distant open spaces for
play; (4-) increasing interest in physi-
cal activity, and participation therein,
by all ages; (5) increasingly sedentary
nature of nearly all occupations, thus
requiring physically active recreation
as a counterirritant.

The acquiring of needed areas while

land is available is one thing, preserv- ‘

ing those we already have is another.—

Creative Aspects

We cannot think of our recreation
programs and their creative aspects ex-
cept as we see them in an environmental
setting. The old order bows to the new.
We all know what is taking place in our
present culture.

Among many changes, our leisure
time is expanded. What 'are we doing
with it? We are spending money at the
box office, unaware of our own poten-
tialities. We applaud the fellow who
excells in football; but what is our na-
tional sport, the one in which you and I
engage—-—for fun—for physical fitness?

What do our recreation programs
mean to the average working man, the
average home? Beauty of works of art
and music? Recreation is the enrich-

DECEMBER 1955

ment of life, “the excellent management
and direction of life.”

We need to create new enthusiasms,
new skills, new interests—with hun-
dreds of thousands adult individuals.
We must create joy, more interest in our
work, and not draw a line between work
and play.

The individual must learn to develop
responsibility, to play the game of life,
to become a citizen who can cooperate.
Recreation must develop in him a “free-
choosing” personality. The freedom of
the spirit is involved here.

A few summers ago I climbed Mount
Shasta with a group of men and women.
We stood on the top at high noon, with
bowed heads before the God who cre-
ated it all.

If our recreation activities do not
bring us face-to-face with our Creator,
we are not succeeding. — ALBERT S.
RAUBENHEIMER, Educational Vice-Pres-
ident, University of Southern Cali-

Public Relations

Public Relations has to do with in-
ducing people to like you, to want to do
business with you, to want to support
you, to want to cooperate with you, to
want to defend you, to seek an under-
standing of what you are doing, to ap-
prove and secure additional money and
facilities so that you may do a bigger
and better job for your community.—
A. OTTO AMBRoz, Chairman, Cedar
Rapids Playground and Recreation
Commission.

A Bold Program

The recreation movement is unique
because it is so very, very complex. It
touches the life of everyone. Everyone
has a stake in recreation, leisure time,
whether he knows it or not.

tions that serve these interests of all the
people of America.

The National ReCreation Association

about homogeneity in the face of all the
heterogeneity in recreation life today.

How does the National Recreation
Association serve the recreation move-

Second . . . through providing an op-
portunity for individual and agency
service memberships, which give people
a sense of belonging, the opportunity to
contribute and a duty to play their part.
Third . . . through the enhancement of
community, through the communica-

recreation affairs. Fourth . . . through
the creation of morale———the conscious-
ness of one’s ability to be equal to the
task that is before him. Through mem-
bership in this great national organiza-
tion, our individual morale and the
morale of the whole movement is effec-
tively enhanced. —-—- GEORGE HJELTE,

Our Relation to the Air Force

Our country is currently maintaining
a total military establishment of close
to three million men. Of this, the Air
Force accounts for almost a million.

This tremendous organization is fed
by a constant How of new volunteer re-
cruits. It is absolutely essential to its
maintenance that each individual who
is in it is there because he wants to be.
However, the Air Force is being bled
white by a tremendous turnover of its
pe0ple.

The area where recreation people can
help is in the integration of Air Force
families into community life. A satisfy-
ing family life is more largely in your
control than it is within that of the mili-
tary. In helping them to become a part
of the community, you are truly doing a
service to the country.

Recreation pGOple are important peo-
ple in an important area of life, in a
crucial period of our national history.
Your leadership and aggressive support
are needed by our military establish-
ment in order that our nation will be as
strong as it must be today.———-BRIGADIER

Edgar Ansel Mowrer is
noted as a commentator,

journalist, and Pulitzer
Prize winner (in 1933).

IAM honored, as a newsman, to be in-
vited to talk to a group of experts,
and delighted, as a personal friend of
one of your founders, that great crea-
tive woman, Jane Addams, to be among
you. It is thanks to her and to all of
you that, during my lifetime, an enor-
mous expansion of planned recreation
of all sorts has taken place in the United
States. You have made not only our
country play-conscious in the best sense,
but you have done much more: you
have spread play through all ranks of
the people, not only the city poor with
whom Jane Addams worked, but even
to the smallest country places.
Remembering what a boon to me, as
a teen-age boy, was a YMCA gymna-
sium in overcrowded Chicago, I can
understand what kind of wonderful
transformation you have brought about
in the United States in every field in-
cluding that, of course, of public health.
Nowhere, may I say from personal ex-
perience, has this planning been more
striking than in the treatment of the
U. S. armed forces overseas in two
world wars, of which I saw something
on the spot. In World War I, I remem-
ber, our troops were left mostly to
themselves. True, there were many
YMCA and Salvation Army men who
ministered heroically to the needs of
our troops both materially and spirit-
ually. But most soldiers found such
recreation as they could, where they
were, and it was usually not of the

highest type.
World War II brought care of the

Recreation—

for What?

From a stimulating address, delivered at the 37th National
Recreation Congress, which gave rise to lively discussion.

American troops to an extremely high
level. It seemed to me, when I was
overseas as a correSpondent, that ahnost
everything possible was being done to
make our fighters as happy and com-
fortable as possible. USO was every-
where, and brought about a vast height-
ening of morale.

During the Korean War, I am told
that our care went so far that some of
the generals actually began to complain
that by putting up such high standards
we were taking too large a share of what
is called the divisional slice. Certainly
it was an immense achievement, and
you people have a particular right to be
proud of it since withOut your educa-
tional, and personal work as well, it
would never have happened.

Our society is perhaps the most so-
cially conscious in the world, thanks
in part to recreationists, and, yet, there
is another curious side to this picture.
The statisticians continue to announce
that the United States is getting more
juvenile delinquency, more mental
health problems, more family insta—
bility, a higher divorce rate proportion-
ately than before, and proportionately
higher than other peoples of compar-
able civilizations. Moreover, thc new
threat of automation is going to con-
front, particularly, the less educated
and resourceful part of our population
with a disconcerting promise of leisure
which their ability to fill is question-
able. This seems' to me absolutely
bound to make bigger problems for rcc-
reationists and to put people like you

Edgar Ansel Mowrer

into the very center of the social picture
in our country over the next fifty years.

Therefore, as you face more of evil
things as well as more of good, some
will say, “Well, without the recreation-
ists, without what we have done, prob-
lems would be even bigger.” Maybe so,
but it is also possible that in our eager-
ness to be social, a zealous few among
us, psychologists, educators and soci-
ologists, have been claiming a somewhat
greater knowledge of social therapy
than the present results can justify.
Maybe we still have a good deal to learn

.about how to improve a society and

individuals.

Now, you certainly cannot expect any
newsman to rush in with answers to any
specific social problem where experts
differ, and I have to ask myself, “Why
then did you ask an outsider to come
here and speak to experts?” It could
only be that you had in mind the one
thing that outsiders can sometimes .use—
fully do—ask basic questions of the
professionals. Here surely, the field is
wide open to anybody, for, after all,
we admit that nobody has all the an-
swers yet. Plato, the Greek philosopher,
stated that a life which is not analyzed
is not worth living, and he still passes
as a wise man.

This newsman, who in the course of
forty years of living and traveling in
all parts of the world and comparing
various cultures and noting the various
results, has been assailed by certain
questions which touch on recreation. in
this year of 1955. Here are some of

RECREATION

them: First, have we been exaggerating
the role of environment and social en-
gineering in making people and under-
estimating the hereditary factor, what
people just are? Second, have we been
exaggerating the value of happiness and
security and underestimating the value
of distress and difficulty, in stimulating
children to their highest potential de-
velopment? Third, have we exaggerated
the basic hunger for what is called
group integration and underestimated
the importance of individualism in pro-
ducing the highest forms of civilization?

I do not pretend to know the answers
to these three questions, though I have
seen facts in many lands that have made
them rise provocatively in my mind.
Sometimes it does seem to me that we
have been doing all these things and, if
we have, it would make a big difference
in judging our work and perhaps indi-
cate the way for some planning. For
instance, if heredity is stronger than
some have admitted, then in urging in-
dividuals to integrate we may have been
sterilizing the potentially most gifted.
If we have overplayed the need for
group security, we may have robbed
some young people of those great crises
which are necessary for their own and
society’s greatest gain. And if we have
neglected the fact that lack of adjust-
ment and loneliness are as necessary to
the greatest flowering of some people as
the sense of belonging is to other people,
then we might wish to supplement our
present social program with another
one, creating circumstances in which ex-
ceptional individuals could flourish and
do more for all of us.

After all, Beethoven, Pasteur, Ein-
stein—or in a more questionable field,
Bonaparte—were not exactly greeters
or joiners or the life of the party. But
they managed to be immortal.

Here we come to the core of the ques-
tion. We all favor recreation—~but
why? Recreation for what? It is no
good saying, “Recreation for society,”
unless you make clear just what kind
of society you want. There is no point
in seeking to increase human happiness
and health, however obviously desirable
as such, unless you are prepared to say
that these are the best that people can
hope for. But if you say that happiness
and health are the highest, then you are
saying that those factors, the unhappi-

DECEMBER 1955

ness and pain of the geniuses which
produced their great works, ought to
have been avoided along with the great
works—by giving these people happier
childhqods.

On these points, as you know, the best
minds disagree. Some say that we have
constructed a new type of mass society
that has never been before, based on
mass production which has never been
before, and democracy which in this
form has never been before, and all of
these need a new mass plan to adjust to
the new conditions. So, they say, let us
promote the extrovert mass man and
discourage all the others if we can’t
make them over altogether. Other peo-
ple argue that in a democracy the needs
of the many take precedence over the
desires of the few and, anyhow, the su-
premely gifted look after themselves.
Well, maybe they can, and maybe they
can’t. There has never been a control
test, and it is hard to see how there can

be one.

Coneeivably, there are frustrations
that are good for us. Eventually we may
come, when we are wiser, to full agree-
ment on these points and be able to act
as one, knowing really which is better,
knowing the full facts about the relative
influence of environment and heredity.
Today we do not. But meanwhile we
do know one thing about ourselves
which makes us look more closely at all
of our social activities. We know that
the American people, despite the Ge-
neva conference in July, are still in-
volved in a fiercely competitive struggle
against another type of society and
another philosophy with the rule of
“winner take all,” and the planet for
stakes.

Certainly, without teamwork, without
the magnificent armies and groups of
people everywhere who are carrying the
ball for our side, no international strug-
gle can be won by us. But it will not be
won without great individuals on our
side as well. For exceptional people
created this struggle. Those revolution-
ists around Lenin, two or three of whom
I happened to know, seem to me to be
the enemies of the human race, but they
were exceptional people. They weren’t
nice, but they were certainly remark-
able, and there was not an integrated
one in a carload. They took an entire
society and shaped it over and made it

into something which I hope will not
endure.

We should also note that those very
people who gave us our best chance, if
not to win at least not lose in this great
struggle, were also very few—and I
speak of those atomic and other scien-
tists who, according to no less an au-
thority than Sir Winston Churchill,
have given us that protection without
which the Communists would already
have taken over Europe and Asia. They
were not, on the whole, integrated citi-
zens without frustrations.

Therefore, it seems to me that those
of us who believe that modern society
has no need for geniuses, or even out-
standing individuals, must install the
new type of state simultaneously every-
where so that there can be no competi-
tion between an old-fashioned state that
still produces these people who make ex-
ceptional things and the new states that
are going to have them all alike.

Otherwise, a country which cultivates
and rewards its so-called toiling intelli-
gentsia, like the USSR, is going to win
the cold war and take over the countries
that have neglected their best minds.

This is not a reassuring age. At the
exact moment when some see Utopia
just around the corner we run from
Hurricane Korea to Typhoon Morocco.
That corner is still going to take some
turning, and we haven’t yet begun to
calculate the angles. As a so-called ex-
pert in world affairs, I think that never
has human freedom been more in jeo-
pardy than right today—when so many
are getting ready to relax under the
illusion either that the cold war is over
or that somehow or other the Russians
have changed their nature and things
are just going to be all right. To me,
a United States that relinquished hu-
man freedom would cease to be worth
saving. Therefore, to survive in free-
dom we are going to have to place more
weight upon excellence and high stand-
ards.. We are going to have to give a
freer reign to the apparently unsocial
person and to the exception, and we
shall have to encourage independent
judgment and the courage to speak out,
if necessary against the majority, for
there lies human quality.

But there is more, and at this point

I leave the field of what I call observed

fact—-—knowledge which is founded up-

467

on what I have seen and lived—to
enter that of personal belief. I believe
that in laying too much stress upon
mass activity, however valuable, we are
creating a new and very dangerous sort
of frustration, the frustration of bore-
dom.

Personal ambition and personal ad-
venture are God’s sharpest spurs in
man. They need encouragement, not
repression, for they will continue to ex-
ist in man no matter what we do and,
unless they get legitimate outlets, they
will take illegitimate ones. It seems to
me that boredom of this sort, mass inte-
gration, is responsible for a fair amount
of rising juvenile delinquency. I believe
that in such boredom, if it is left to
fester in a generation of people blessed
or cursed by automation and the leisure
it will bring, people will in time become
so tired of sameness and tameness that

they will welcome any sort of wild ad-
venture—even a new war.

There is a thrill in danger to the
human mind that nothing else quite
equals; and man, as I have seen him in
several continents, is—for better or for
worse—as much lion as sheep. Look
at the hot-rod specialists in every com-
munity. Look at the behavior of our
young people whenever they get loose
to do what they want to do. Make the
criminal into a cop and you often save
him, for the thrill of _cops and robbers
is ever present, and the game is what
he needs. So, it seems to me that, if

you stifle legitimate outlets for the
dangerous in human nature, you may
find people even tiring of civilization
itself.

I have visited many countries re-
cently, and over my life, and none are
quite exempt from the symptoms of that
slightly civilized boredom that would
become a deadly danger if allowed to go
on and if no antidote for it is furnished.
Obviously, man is neither a roaming
beast'nor is he a well-behaved conform-
ist as many moderns seem to think. Yet
he is sometimes both, now one and now
the other. It is not a question of our
choosing between having a happier
mass or a gifted few. We can have them
both. It is a question of education, of
pr0portion, of stressing the one of these

two values which is in most danger of
being submerged.

They are both part of that strange
duality which is man, and the Middle
Ages produced not only what it called
the church, one-and-indivisible, but
those supreme individualists, the mys-
tics.

Just now, however, it seems to me
that the need is for more great soloists.
So, if I am asked, “What for—recrea-
tion anyway?” I should very honestly
have to‘ answer flatly, “For a greater
America.” Thanks to the Communist
challenge we need a greater America if
we are to have any America at all, for
a mediocre America founded on con-
formity will not survive. Make up your

minds to this: more health and happi-
ness won’t do unless people find part of
these as individuals in daring and diffi-
cult accomplishment.

We need leaders who are personally
able to strain and endure beyond their
strength regardless of their personal
happiness, no matter if some of them
are screwballs, provided they be greatly
creative. We need more lonely thinkers,
ignoring their immediate ends to seek
those greater conquests that apparently
can be reached best in solitude. We
need peOple also who will use more of
their recreation for better public serv-
ice. Here it seems to me is where
American educators and recreationists
can come right into this picture along
with a new leisure of automation.

It is precisely because of the growing
weight of mass social factors that you
experts must divert and warn and direct
us in keeping a balance between a de-
cent society and a great variety of crea-
tive individuals. “No man,” said John
Donne, “is an island unto himself.” No
man can exist alone without a society
in which he has some roots. But every-
body can and should aspire to become
an imposing promontory, not just a flat
bit of pasture identical with a million
other flat bits of pasture.

Today, inspiring every person with
whom you come in contact to be as great
as possible, either alone or with his fel-
lows, as well as to be healthy and happy,
could integrate the already great work
of American recreationists. Ti"

 

“Greater latitude is permitted in discussing philosophies of recrea-
tion than in discussing education. Recreation, like education, is a word
of many meanings. Then too, it is doubtful that any of the philosophers
and theories in the field of recreation occupy the preeminent position that
Dewey and his theories hold in education. Being younger than educa-
tion in the formal sense, recreation has fewer spokesmen and less histor-
ical data upon which to anchor its theory and practice. Perhaps this is
a strength rather than weakness, for recreation is gaining world-wide
recognition as an essential element of the good life at a speed equaling
or exceeding that of education. No longer a luxury, recreation is now
accepted as a necessity in the proper growth and development of every
man, woman, and child.”

“RELAX!”

Results of the experience gained since “F amily Fun,” our
Northwest at Play Committee television series, was planned
a year ago, can be summed up in that one word. Like many
other groups eXperimenting with television programing in
general, and educational-type programs in particular, mem-
bers of our committee were skeptical, at first, of our ability
to meet demands of this new medium of communication.
After the first series of fifteen half-hour shows had been
completed in June, we felt like “old hands,” ready to ap-
proach a second series without fear. We relaxed!

Our best advice at mid-point is: plan carefully; get the
show on the road; then, while learning, enjoy yourself. No
one person should carry the load; the framework should pro-
vide a team. Station personnel, performers, agency staff
members will be helpful allies.

The camera, you learn, is not a deadly guided missile.
Give it a little cooperation by planning what is technically
possible. Instruct participants to look it straight in the eye,
then proceed, recognizing camera limitations as well as
their own.

Experiment

Don’t be afraid to try something different, provided that.

the program director is “game.” What you suggest may be

within the realm of production possibility. For example, we
planned one program on barbecuing, kippering, and smok-
ing of salmon, a Northwest delicacy. We didn’t use a film
of the processes; we telecast them live. The “kipper house”
needed was too smoky to bring into the studio. But the sta-
tion let us set it up on the outside parking lot adjacent to the
loading platform. When the time came, on the program,
our director moved a TV camera outside on the platform.
As the script said, “Smoke rolls out; salmon is hot and smok-
ing. Everyone takes a sample.”

For another program we planned to show a film clip of the
family visiting a farm, using film taken the previous sum-

workshop sponsored in Seattle by a commercial station, KING-TV.
Since that time Mrs. Pike has had opportunity to work with three
series of half-hour shows, one on KING-TV for the state parks. For
the other two, she has served as chairman of the Northwest at Play

mer. When we found that it was 8mm. taken‘at silent speed
(16 frames) we didn’t think we could use it, and we couldn’t
do a 16mm. retake in the middle of the winter. One stout-
hearted member of the station’s technical stag figured a bit
with his pencil and came up with the announcement, “I don’t
see why we can’t use it anyway.” And we did! An 8mm.
projector and screen was set up in the studio. The TV
camera moved in, telecasting the picture appearing on the
screen, in a very respectable manner. (I wouldn’t advise
making a practice of the method, however.)

A traveling family with seven daughters arrived on-cam-
era in their own station wagon, by way of the station parking
lot and the loading platform. Since there wasn’t room in the
studio for the family car, one of the talented teen-agers in
the family drew a life-size reasonable facsimile of the sta-
tion wagon on a huge piece of paper which was hung on the
wall. Such “flats” look very real when viewed on the TV
screen.

The “spectacular” of our spring series was a pantomime
of the record “Johnny Appleseed,” done in costume by the
five small Imason boys (aged one to eight years)’, their par-
ents, and three little American Indian boys (aged eight,
nine, and ten), whom the family brought with them from
Indianola where they all lived. Props were the neighbor’s
birdhouse for a cabin, the kids’ coaster wagon with prairie
schooner top, some pen drawings of animals hung on the
wall, and an “apple tree” with paper apples made by the
studio.

The oldest Imason boy, eight-year-old Mike, was Johnny"
Appleseed. His costume included a stew kettle hat, complete
with handle, and a Bible. The hat was inclined to slip down
over his eyes when he tried to read his Bible, but he would
give the handle a shove and continue unperturbed. His next
younger brother, Pat, with a coonskin cap, unruly red hair,
and front teeth missing, was the angel. Robert, the “ham”
of the outfit, swished the tail on his skunk costume (all his
own idea). Tommy wore a donkey suit, pulling the prairie
schooner, with dad and mother carrying baby Stephen as
the pioneers walked behind.

The Indian boys, in blue jeans, stripped to the waist and
well-smeared with warpaint, came into the act at the point
on the record referring to the “fierce” Indians. The camera
moved in close to pick up one small redskin—chewing gum
for all he was worth! .

After the pantomime sequence was completed, the mother
explained that the family often dramatized records. She
thought it was better for the youngsters than just sitting

469

around listening.

The production also had community angles. Because of
interest in Indianola, the local community hall was equipped
with TV and everyone invited to attend. Also, the family
was asked by the local school superintendent to repeat the
performance at school.

Our Basic Rules

We had to learn some basic rules about TV production,
some of which are repeated here in the hope they will be
useful to you. I

Plan programs a month or more in advance of the tele-
casting date. Make arrangements with the station, plan the
script, have a specific understanding with performers about
what they are to do, and select and prepare all visual and
audio materials such as studio cards, slides, or film.

.' Titles and credits should be short and prepared to fit
station specifications. Usually, this means printing in good
showcard style on off-white, dull-finish cardboard of speci-
fied size, probablynll by 14 inches, horizontal, always in
the necessary 3:4 ratio. To be legible, illustration and
wording must be confined to a specified central space, with
generous borders. Cards can be used in the studio or photo-
graphed and 35mm. slides made for use in the projection
room. _

, “The use of short three- to five-minute film clips, pictures,
or slides add variety and interest to a program, provided
they meet station specifications. - Film must be 16mm. taken
at sound speed (24 frames), preferably black and white.
Large, dull-finish photographs, in station specified sizes,
may be used much like studio cards. Smaller photographs
will fit the station’s teloptican. Horizontal 35mm. color
slides can also be projected, but colors must provide good
contrast in grays. Not more than twelve slides can be used
in a sequence as this is the maximum number most of the
telopticans will take at one time. Some take less. Detail
must be 'within a centralized s'p'ace'; otherwise it will not
show on the home screen.

Performers should be given information on how ‘to dress,
how to face the camera, and how to move about the set, in-
cluding entrances and exits. If an object is to be exhibited,
instruct participants in method so viewers can see it clearly.
For example, if the object is held in the hand, don’t jiggle
it; hold it steady, resting the elbow on a table if necessary,
and extend the object forward toward the camera, revolving
it slowly to allow viewers'to see all sides.

Use “psychology” on performers. We developed a special
technique with teen-agers. Most of them are more willing
to appear if someone they know—other than mother and
dad—asks them, and if they can help plan the show. In our
experience, children, even three: or four-year-old tots, were
very natural, carrying their parts surprisingly well, almost
oblivious of the camera. \Ve gave them a chance during re-
hearsal to see themselves on the studio monitor camera. By
show time, the novelty had worn off, and they relaxed into
familiar home routines of singing songs, playing games.

The Format

For a series of ,programs, it is important to.establish a

-1~7_U

standard format that can be adapted for all shows. This may
not “jell” until the third or fourth program, but after that,
it is invaluable. For example, on “Family Fun,” we de-

veloped a program procedure which varies very little from
week to week:

Theme: Short musical theme opening, same one each time. Best
themes come from small musical group recordings; band and orches-
tra musm is too “busy.”

Slide: Title—~“Fan1ily Fun."

Booth announcer: “Thisjs another production of ‘Family Fun,’ with
your host,2 Chuck Piersee,” and so on.

Close-up studio shot of host and guest expert: If latter is used, he is
always someone from the sponsoring group.

Body of program: Generally has been a number of sequences in which
the family shows in detail their own home activities. At times film
clips or slides have been used, for part of the show, with one member
of the family narrating off-camera. We always try to have one “extra”
sequence ready in case it is needed to fill time.

Sometimes the family carries on alone without the host on the set,
but we have had the best luck when he has joined the family, asking
questions while they perform.

Throughout the series, we took every appropriate Oppor-
tunity to point out what we mean by family recreation, the
meaningful philosophy behind the series.

Programs are always subject to schedule and time changes
by the station. These appear to be part of the business.
We were lucky on the educational channel; we relinquished
only one period, and we knew that a long time in advance.

portant to the success of the programs as actual production,
and is worth an explanation.

At the time KCTS-TV was preparing to go on the air late
in 1954, John S. Richards, Seattle city librarian, and a mem-
ber of the community KCTS-TV board, called together rep-
resentatives of informal education agencies and organiza-
tions and asked them to submit suggestions for programs in
writing, to be screened for practicability and merit. As the
representative of the Washington State Parks and Recrea-
tion Commission, I suggested a program featuring family
recreation. I favored sponsorship by a group composed of
all the public and private departments and agencies in the
listening area who had interest in recreation.

The idea caught on; and, in December, twenty-two recrea-
tion departments and agencies met to discuss a way of im-
plementing the family recreation program idea. From this
beginning, our Northwest at Play Committee emerged.

Briefly, the committee is organized in this manner. The
entire committee chose a five-person operating board,3 rep-
resenting different facets of recreation. This operating
board was the contact with the station. It screened ideas
coming from other members of the entire committee; ar-
ranged a schedule; selected a host. Each operating board
member took responsibility for seeing that a certain number
of the shows scheduled were properly planned and that they
got on the air. No one board member had to worry about
details of all the shows.

We could never have achieved our purpose without «the
all-out COOperation of the members of the board. For many
weeks, we met each Friday noon at lunch. We spent hours
at the station and many more negotiating the programs.
With the aid of other members of the general committee, we
presented fifteen half-hour programs on Tuesdays at 7:30
P.M. between February 15 and June 7.

During that period, nineteen different families appeared

3The operating board membership was increased to seven in
September.

on programs, for eleven sponsoring agencies, including pub-
lic recreation, a college, industry, Girl Scouts and Camp
Fire Girls, the camping association, and a state agency. Par-
ticipants were from many occupations. We had employees
from large industries, such as Boeing Airplane Company,
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the Great
Northern Railroad. One father was a landscape architect,
one a city fireman, another a sheet-metal worker. We had a
minister, a teacher, an architect. We had family champion-
ship teams in tennis and badminton, the city’s outstanding
puppeteer, a specialist in “beach lore,” a family of garden-
ers, and two campers. We had photography and woodwork
demonstrations. We were fascinated by a high school senior
and the story of how his hobby, trains and study of rail-
roading, had provided him with a vocation and promise of
a job with-a major railroad after college. We had a little
girl’s birthday party in the studio, demonstrations of games
and home-made game boards, music, and family trips.

We received more than five hundred audience responses to
programs, partlyphone calls, partly written requests for prof-
fered mimeographed materials. This material gave direc-
tions for playing the games, making the hobby articles, hints
on family camping, even recipes.

In the production we had the valuable technical assistance
of KCTS-TV personnel who spent much time with us, often
beyond “the call of duty.” We are grateful to Kenneth
Ritchey and Gordon Tuell, program personnel assigned to
our informal education type of program, and especially to
Ken, who is at the director’s “controls” during each telecast.

Fall Series

The over-all success of our program, I believe, can be
measured by the fact that the station asked us for a fall
series. This began on September 13. It has included a pro-
gram on such hobbies as basketry, shell jewelry, wood-fibre
flower making, c0pper work; the recreation activities of an
American family who have been living in an all-German
community near the Soviet Zone; football; progression of
recreation activities as the family grows; a minority group
family; a Halloween party; and others.

An Appraisal

During the summer of 1955, we took time to appraise our
offerings. We liked our general format, but we felt the need
of more coordination between shows such as might be
obtained through publication of a listening manual to be
available to audiences before the telecast.

We felt need of a written aid to performers on what to
expect of programs, providing hints on selection of program
material from what they have to offer, choosing pictures
and slides, dress, timing, and other cues. Getting variety
in programs, making .certain that families selected have
something practical to offer, the values of our programs in
terms of a contribution to family life, all came under scru-
tiny. We have had to do a bird educating, too, of some of
our recreation agencies who still see recreation only in terms
of age groups on the community playground rather than as
an integral part of family life. We felt, too, that we should
broaden our membership somewhat. As a result, we have

471

twenty-seven agencies and departments on the committee.
On the credit side, we noted the whole-hearted coopera-
tion of both public and private agencies in this joint project.
We were pleased with the morale building effect that the
programs seemed to have on participating families, a by-
product that had not occurred to us. In addition to their
personal pride in showing how well they pursued some ac-
tivity together, they seemed gratified to learn that others
noticed and appreciated the closeness of the tie binding them
together as a family unit. They have completed their shows
feeling, that, after all, they may have something in their par-

ticular family of great intangible value that money cannot
buy and that they may help other families to hnd.

We are spending considerable time this year in publicizing
the series so that more people will know about it. The
Northwest at Play Committee is sending out monthly sched-
ules and news releases, asking departments and agencies to
circularize them in their publications and on bulletin boards
among their groups. We have the cooperation of local libra-
ries in distribution of material offered as program aids and
supplements.

THE SHow’s ON THE ROAD! 35'

 

73k

CITIZENS of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
each day encounter a cheerful, co-
operative attitude on the part of their
public servants. Librarians and gar-
bage collectors, telephone operators and
tax assessors, museum guards and wa-
ter department clerks, t0p officials and
lowly employees in every branch of the
city government go out of their way to
give their ultimate bosses, the taxpay-
ers, the best possible service in the
friendliest possible manner. The voters
love it.

For generations the pe0ple of the
city-by-the-lake have been accustomed
to good public service. But of late
something new has been added.

The people call it the “Charm School”
—a unique institution operated by the
city to teach its employees how to deal
pleasantly and efficiently with the pub-
lic and with one another. In six years
more than one thousand municipal
workers (about one in five), ranging
from common laborers to department
heads, have been graduated from the
course.

The school term is four weeks. Classes
run one hour each, two mornings a
week, with from eighteen to twenty-five
students to a class. They attend on city
time. It would be hard to find a more
diverse group anywhere than the men
and women of a typical class—-account-
ants, labor foremen, telephone opera-

tors, engineers, stenographers, bridge'

tenders, public health nurses, planning
analysts, tree surgeons, architects, gar-
bage collection supervisors, punchma-
chine operators. Veterans and new em-
ployees quickly find that no matter what
their obs they face the same problems.

472

A Different Kind of “Charm School”

“The more diversified, the better the
class,” eXplains the teacher, who is
from the vocational school faculty.
“The laborer digging a hole in the
street in front of some unhappy citizen’s
home and the girl answering a com-
plaint on the city hall telephone may
seem to have nothing in common, but
underneath we find the same knotty
human equations. In our classes we
show how common courtesy makes
everyone’s job easier.”

Time and time again the school has
proved that a librarian, by sharing what
she has learned while dealing with the
public at a check-out desk, can help the
garbage collector, and that the garbage
man, in turn, can assist the librarian.
Architects, accountants, and sewer
workers, by pooling their wisdom and
practical knowledge, solve headaches
for one another. The youngsters sup-
ply enthusiasm, the oldtimers solid
judgment based on experience.

Classes are most informal. There are
no lectures. The teacher merely acts as
discussion leader. Each member of each
class brings personal eXperiences and
convictions he wants to share.

At the first meeting of each class,
every member receives the “Charm
School Textbook,” a small blue card on
which the entire course is printed in
one hundred words. One side lists four
steps to take in every public contact;
on the other side are “tips for a city em-
ployee to remember.” The “tips” are
these:

“My time is the taxpayer’s money,
entrusted to my care. I must invest it
well. Service to the public is my duty.
The public is made up of individuals

71:7

who must be understood and dealt with
as such. It is smart to be courteous.”

The four steps are just as simple: (I) '
GREET individual or groiip promptly,
pleasantly, courteously, sincerely; (2)
LISTEN attentively and patiently; get
the facts; (3) PROVIDE information,
material, service; or (4) REFER to
proper authority. Do everything pos-
sible to close the interview on a friend-
ly note. Follow up when necessary.

The students often pair off, after the
first few meetings, and bring their prob-
lems to class in dialogue form, one im-
personating a taxpayer, the other a bar-
assed city employee. When they have
finished they ask the class what they
have done wrong, how they could have
done better. Lively discussions follow.

The school teaches the employee to
listen attentively and carefully, to be
sympathetic but cautious, to promise
nothing that he isn’t positive he can de-
liver. Because any municipality is
bound up in red tape and hedged in by
legal restrictions, many citizens have
a hard time understanding why certain
seemingly reasonable things cannot be
done. The Charm School pounds home
the necessity of eXplaining simply, pa-
tiently and at length, until even the
most obtuse taxpayer understands.

The good effects of the school can be
felt even among employees who have
not yet attended a class. Participants go
back to their departments full of en-
thusiasm and share it with the fellow

workers. ‘5'

If you’re looking for another
\h mass activity, have you explored

the possibility of a “geared-up”

figure-skating program?

“SKATING with a twist” is better known as figure skating.
In St. Cloud, Minnesota, where the winter starts in
November and extends well into March, we need a program,
planned around our natural outdoor skating areas, which
will keep interest at a reasonably high pitch throughout the
skating season. While skating, in itself, was one of this
country’s earlier forms of recreation, skating interest during
the course of the present-day season rapidly wanes unless
some extra stimulus is applied. Many communities have a
well-balanced hockey program to keep the interest of young
men and boys at a fever point; but what about the other
sex? What is done to maintain their skating interest? This
community has turned to figure skating as a possible an-
swer, and the results to date have been most gratifying.

In establishing our figure-skating program, we realized
that maximum participation would not be obtained unless
some form of motivation or means-to-an-end principle was
applied. It seemed axiomatic that prospective figure skat-
ers, as a group, would not develop a high degree of interest
unless some reasonable opportunity was given for them to
demonstrate their achievements. The answer, therefore, has
been for our figure skating club to present an ice show to the
public near the end of each season. ‘

Prior to the installation of such a program, a figure-skat-
ing instruction syllabus was prepared, to cover (I) begin-
ner, (2) intermediate, and (3) advanced classes.

MR. THORSON is superintendent of recreation in St. Cloud.

An advanced class receives instruction. Graduates will become

eligible for membership in St. Cloud Figure Skating Club.

Determination as to the proper class in which an instruc-
tee should be placed is ascertained by the results of classi-
fication tests given each new candidate desiring to take in-
struction. Usual progression will find an instructee being
placed in the beginner class the first year, the intermediate
class the second year, and the advanced class the third year.
After successfully passing the test for the advanced class,
the candidate is eligible for membership in the figure skat-
ing club.

Instruction in this program is handled by certain key
members of the club who are chosen on the basis of their
relative maturity, skating and instructional ability. The

organization and administration of the club and of the skat-
ing program is placed in the hands of the one individual
whose sole responsibility is to synchronize the efforts of in-
structors who work with him, and to plan and organize the
annual ice show presented by the club.

Mass participation has now been reached. The figure
skating club’s annual ice show currently performs each year
before an estimated local audience of two thousand specta-
tors. Fame of the group has spread, withthe result that our
club now goes on the road each Sunday during the winter
to present the show to other communities in the area.

While this type of program was originally instituted for

473

young women and girls, the impression should not be given
that it is restricted to them. Young men and boys may, and
do, participate. We are proud to say that graduates of our
program are now touring the country with several of the
nation-wide “name” skating shows.

Syllabus and General Outline

Prepared by the St. Cloud Recreation Department

CLASSIFICATION TEST. Before any skater can be eligible
to receive skating instruction, he or' she must achieve! or
have a certain amount of native ability. The following test
should be given to all those desiring td receive instruction
for the first time. Minimum requirements: (1) ability to
skate forward; (2) general balance while skating; (3) abil-
ity to stand.

Ability to perform the above three movements is manda-
tory for registration in the beginner class. If the skater can
perform advanced movements, the supervisor should place
him in a class commensurate with his ability. Skaters who
received certificates the previous winter for successful com-
pletion of a particular class are automatically eligible for
the next higher class.

GRADATIONS OF FIGURE SKATING INSTRUCTION.

Beginner Class

1. Stroking. This is very important since nothing else
can be taught with any degree of success until stroking has
reached an efficient level.

2. Form and balance. Aside from stroking, this includes
general form, movement of the arms with each stroke, rise
and bend of the skating knee, and so on.

3. Skate to music. Using the loudspeaker, instructees

should be introduced to appr0priate music and taught to
stroke and skate in rhythm.

a 4. Skate backwards.
5. Extended edge forward on one foot. This will aid the
skater in skating on one foot and lead to the spiral.

Intermediate Class

1. Perfection of beginners’ objectives listed above. While
instructees must be able to do all of the objectives of the be-
ginner class, perfection should constantly be stressed.

2. Ability to come to sudden stOp using both feet. This
might be termed ability to keep one’s skating efforts under
control at all times.

3. Three turns-——forward, both feet, both edges. Arm
and leg position is of utmost importance and should be
stressed.

4. Cut backs—both directions.

5. Forward crossovers — left foot over right and vice
versa.

6. Forward spiral.

7. Mohawk turn.
Advanced Class

1. Must perform all of objectives of intermediate class
including forward spiral on opposite foot.

2. One-foot stop. ' '

3. vBunnyhop.

4. Shoot-the-duck. - .

5.-Backward spiral. “

4-74

6. Two-foot Hat spin.
7. Waltz jump.
8. Reverse jump.

LENGTH OF LESSONS. All lessons should be approximately
one-half hour in length. This may be extended or shortened
as the case may be. Factors in length of each period should
be: average age of class, weather conditions and enthusiasm
shown at that particular time. The younger the participant,
the shorter his interest span. If youngsters are kept too
long, don’t be surprised if they are absent next time. If on
occasions, they show an unusual amount of enthusiasm for
some form of instruction, let them exceed the time limit,
but be sure to call the class to a halt before enthusiasm wanes.

SIZE OF CLASS. About eight to ten instructees per in-
structor. Ten is considered to be the maximum.

LENGTH OF COURSE. About six weeks in length, starting
shortly after the beginning of the skating season. Lessons
should be once a week with an alternate instruction period
scheduled so that if bad weather interferes, instructees would
get at least one instruction period. Course should not exceed
six weeks as interest span generally drops off after that.

INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURE. You will undoubtedly find
out from experience, what procedure Works best for you and
your particular class, but generally this method may be
used: “Instructor should be at front of class—explain what
he or she will do, then demonstrate it to class, then ask class
to do it together and then one by one. Instructor should
then help individually those as necessary.”

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONAL INFORMATION

1. Regularity of attendance. Many obstacles will be pre-
sented to you as an instructor. It is best to emphasize at
first meeting of class and constantly thereafter, regularity
of attendance. Make it understood that if any individual
falls behind the general ability progress made by the class
as a whole, he must of necessity be dropped.

2. Lack of confidence. Many of your instructees will
lack confidence, necessitating constant encouragement on
your part. While encouragement is necessary, be careful,
not to overdo it.

3. Practice in between sessions. Emphasize constantly
the need to practice daily between instrudtional periods.
Periods of instruction are only to demonstrate and assist
but instructee must do the bulk of practice by himsclf.

4. Skate fitting. Many youngsters are trying to receive
instruction on skates with which even Sonja Henie would
have difficulty. Poor fit, dullness, and so on, are only a few.
of their faults. While there is little that you as an instructor
can do, it should at least be your duty to inform the instruc-
tee and parents by note about what you think is wrong.

TESTING. At the conclusion of the course, a test should
be devised based on the general objcctives as listed for that
particular classification. This test should be given to your
class and those who pass should be given a certificate so
stating. This should make them cligible to advance to the
next higher classification of figure skating instruction.

ST. CLOUD FIGURE SKATING CLUB. Hencefortli, only those

passing the “advanced” classification test shall be eligible
for membership in the St. Cloud Figure Skating Club. ‘5'

How a Town Can Unite—for Youth

Citizens make a dream come true.

THE HANDWRITING on the child’s stationery was large and

clear. It read: “Dear Sirs, I am having a childrens first
annual dog show at my house Sat. May 26. A lot of dog
owners from my class are coming and I am charging 5¢ each
for spectators and I will send all the money to the Youth
House. I am enclosing right now, $2.50 for the Youth
House. I got $5.00 from Mr. and Mrs. W for finding
their Labrador Retriever. I am keeping half of the money to
buy a training leach for my dog Ginger. Yours truly, Joan
S—--—————.”

From anyone in La Canada, California, a town of family-
lm-ing people in the foothills of the Sierra Madres, Joan’s
letter would bring a nod of understanding approval, because
in La Canada the town as a whole works, and has fun doing
it, to support its community built and owned La Canada
Youth House.

In 1947, when the old army barracks which had been the
only meeting place of its youth groups burned down, the
imminent problem of how to go about providing a new
building brought leaders of youth and civic groups together
in a common cause. At the time, the population was five
thousand, with an increase estimated at twelve thousand by
1960. The figure, in 1954, rose to fifteen thousand. After
careful studies of the needs of 1,238 children who had no
adequate place for group activities—because the facilities
of the decentralized scho‘ols provided no auditoriums or
gymnasiumsH-an inspirational beginning was found in a
fund of $3,500. This had been established in 1940 by ad-

mirers of the late Percy Hamilton Johnson, former super-

Scenes like this, on community’s hilly streets, pointed up need for youth center.

Grace Curran

intendent of La Canada schools. It had been his dream that,
some day, such a youth center would exist.

The newly formed youth council was faced with many
weighty problems. Where to locate the center? How large
would it have to be? Assuming the town would build it,
could they count on continued support for operational ex-
penses? These, and many other aspects of the project, were
considered endlessly. Then the council took the plunge.

A lot of 16,600 square feet was purchased with the fund,
adjacent to the new junior high school’s athletic field, with
assurances of the full cooperation of the school authorities in
the use of their athletic facilities. As the acquired property
had no ingress or egress to any street, a zone variance was
sought and won over the protests of the usual “against-ers.”
With high hopes, the council incorporated as a non-profit
corporation, elected a board of trustees with staggered
terms to promote continuity. The board launched its first
campaign for funds in November, 1949. D

With a slogan of “Buy a Child a Share,” the community
responded with cash donations, pledges of labor, profes-
sional services, and building material which reached the
$39,000 mark by February 1950. Every organization in
town participated in the drive, from the chamber of com-
merce down to groups of school children who swelled the
fund with their nickles and dimes. Plaques, pianos, and
paint were only a few of the unusual plcdgcs. Suddenly the
town realized it was having fun in helping toward making La
Canada the best place under the sun for its youngsters.

When the ground breaking ccre'mony" took place on May
27, 1950, every detail had been worked out to its finest point.
County Supervisor Roger Jessup applauded: “With practi-
cally everybody in the nation habituated to besicge the near-
est govcrnment bureau for a handout of public funds, this is
a breeze of hope that is rolling out of La Canada. The peo-

ple up there apparently are of the Opinion that if they want
a building for use of their youngsters, they should dig down
and build it themselves, and own it themselves, instead of
having the county finance it, and then put in a bureau to
manage it.”

From the groundwork up, the building took form with
everything in' it or about it completely donated, from the
architectural plans, contracting, plumbing, painting, electri-
cal system, roofing, lumber, bricks, radiant furnace system,
down to the smallest tacks. “Roofing bees,” “button board
bees,” “dad and shovel days” attracted the men of the town.
Doctors, lawyers, butchers, bakers, artists, and salesmen
with widely diversified experience donned overalls and, with
the women and children providing stimulating coffee and re-
freshments, went to it. Square dances were held in the build-
ing while it was still in a rough state, with proceeds going
to defray construction costs. A four-day community fair
was held, help came from private clubs, and finally an allo-
cation from the local chapter of the Community Chest topped
off construction costs.

On October 25, 1951, the public was invited for its first
look at a handsome, sprawling flagstone and stucco building
of six thousand square feet, with the spacious auditorium
displaying a huge fireplace which served as a barbecue on
one of the patios. There are nine meeting rooms with out-
side exits so that groups can be held simultaneously with-
out confusion, a kitchen, and a serving bar. With an eye
to its use as the population increases, the walls on either
side of the main room open to a patio, tripling its capacity.
A large stage, complete with dressing rooms, is at one end
of the assembly. ‘

Hundreds of La Canadans who gave moral, monetary, or
muscular support to the building of the community’s new
recreation building gathered on December 9, 1951, to hear
the dedication to the memory of Percy Hamilton Johnson.

center evaluated by insurance appraisers at $85,000 for
building, land, equipment, and labor——which had been ap-
praised at $2.00 an hour for voluntary adult and at $1.00
an hour for boys and girls—included in the sum total.

With the actual operation of the center, problems of dif-
ferent natures arose. To provide for operating expenses, an
annual drive for members is launched in February of each
year. In 1952, a goal was set and reached at $5,000. The
following year, $8,000 was needed and $10,000 came in
from the community which understood that the youth coun-
cil depended upon it for support. One dollar buys a mem-
bership; one hundred dollars, a life membership; and one
thousand dollars, a founder membership.

Whenever a specific need arises, the community ingen-
iously supplies the answer. Local merchants came through
with collections for the purchase of records for the young-
sters’ “platter dances.” In turn, the kids sold their old ones
at children-operated booths at P.T.A. carnivals and used the
proceeds to buy new ones. Some merchants donated merch-
andise as door prizes or for raffles at some of the groups’
money-raising projects. One gas station proprietor turned
over a day’s profits. P.T.A. organizations frequently give
the proceeds of paper drives. One market installed a perma-
nent “grease collection” exchange where housewives desig—
nate that their credits for fat drippings go to the youth
house. The fathers’ council of the junior high school spon-
sors an annual harvest moon dance which has become a tra-
ditional social event in the community. A “buy a chair” cam-
paign resulted in funds enough to buy three hundred chairs.
Many groups and clubs make their project the raising of
money to buy specific pieces of equipment. The furniture
is all donated and repaired by parents. Other donors gave
the public address system, shrubs, and garden equipment.
Many bereaved members of the community indicate that a
donation to the youth house is preferable to flowers, and a
memory book of their names and contributions has been

compiled. When the need for the parking lot was publicized,
a group of residents responded by planning, supervising,
donating materials, and constructing a lot for sixty-eight
cars with concrete wall, lighting, striping, bumper stops.

In its third year of operation, a pattern had been estab-
lished which is continually being improved upon to handle
the needs of the 2,700 children who use it monthly. A
group of women active in P.T.A. and civic affairs formed a
club which later was accepted into the Assistance League,
primarily to staff and raise funds for the youth house. Each
member must work forty hours, doing any job that comes
along———which may be office work, hostessing visitors, burn-
ing trash, facilitating groups and their problems, gardening,
defrosting the icebox, and many other chores. Besides this,
the club features annual money-raising events, such as a
fashion show and tea, or a series of supper dances, from
which they have realized funds to present the youth council
with stage curtains, fencing, and contributed a substantial
check towards the first full-time director’s salary.*

Designed principally for the use of organized youth
groups in La Canada, the youth house’s established policies
and their observances are specific. Adult groups, except for
political or commercial purposes, are permitted to use it and
a donation is expected; but youth group needs have priority.
A responsible adult must be present at any group meeting.
Drinking of alcoholic beverages is prohibited on the prem-
ises. Smoking is permitted in designated rooms only when
adult groups meet. Fireplace and barbecue use is strictly con-
trolled. Clean up by each group is obligatory. Damage to
the premises or equipment is the responsibility of the per-
petrator. Accidents or injuries are recorded, and the school
doctor is available. Dances follow a “code” established by
the junior high school, ending promptly at 11:30 P.M., re-
stricted to groups in the school district only. The building
is cleaned and locked by midnight. Those attending func-
tions must sign out if leaving before activity closes, stating
time and destination. These house rules are amended to
handle situations as they arise. .

Use of the youth house is extensive. Twenty-seven differ-
ent scout groups meet regularly, the boards of review, courts
of honor, basic training courses, district meetings, special

programs, and barbecues are accommodated. School groups
provided with a meeting place include the P.T.A., pre-school
nursery, school dances, shows, parties and assemblies.
Church youth groups of all denominations, Red Cross first
aid classes, organized private youth clubs such as the Rock,
Gem, and Mineral Society, and Hi-Y, which must be spon-
sored by adults, are also given scheduled meeting time.
Several adult groups meet, but only when youth groups do
not need the space.

Children are made to feel that the youth house is their
own and are encouraged to participate in every way possi-
ble. Scouting groups do gardening, cleanup, and mainte-
nance work toward obtaining merit badges as a community
service. Youth groups contribute required furnishings for
their individual meeting rooms. Youth forums are held to
discuss problems, and suggestions from the youngsters are
carefully considered by the youth council. In their own ac-
tivities, the children are steered by adult counselors into
making their own plans.

Inasmuch as the youth house is owned by the community,
a_newspaper column called “Inside the Youth House” is
published by the La Canada Sun which, in an informal
neighborly way, acquaints the town of all developments,
needs, or donations which appear under a “Youth House
Angels” heading. An annual brochure, voluntarily com-
piled and printed, is mailed to each home giving a complete
picture of current operations and a financial statement, vol-
untarily prepared by an outstanding firm of accountants.
The town watches each month to see whom the youth coun-
cil will honor with an “Angie”-—an award given for out-
standing volunteer services. The youngsters are similarly
honored annually not only for the hours put in, but for the
spirit in which the work is done.

The youth council feels that opportunities are unlimited
for expansion. It would like to see classes established, be-
sides the summer recreation course which offers games,
dancing, arts and crafts, cooking, carpentry, baby-sitting,
grooming, photography, and other absorbing hobbies. It
knows that another year will see an end to indebtedness, as
over half of the notes on the parking lot property has already
been paid off. It would like to see the center fully furnished.

And it will. Because one man had a dream, and a whole

town united to make it come true. *

NOTE

Reporting Recreation Attendance

The Miami Beach (Florida) Recreation Department, in
the year 1952-53, adopted the form of recording public rec-
reation services recommended by the National Committee
on Statistics for Public Recreation. The method proposed
by the committee was designed to afford a picture of the
nature and extent of the services rendered by a recreation
department, for the information of the city authorities and
the general public.

In its “Three-Year Progress Report” for the period 1951-
54 the department records its use of the reporting method.

The new method shows:

A. The number and kind of regularly scheduled activities con-
ducted by the staff on duty at each facility, together with the attend-
ance of participants and spectators at each.

B. Areas and facilities supervised by the recreation department
(not including regularly scheduled activities above).

C. Registration of individuals. A cumulative, non-duplicating reg—
istration system which shows the actual number of persons who reg-

ister with the recreation department, thus affording some comparison
w1th total population, and so on.

D. Special interest group enrollment, showing how much interest
there is in a particular interest group.

Mrs. Marion Wood Huey, assistant superintendent of the
Miami Beach Recreation Department, was a member of
the committee that prepared the report following an experi-
mental period. The publication, Manual on Recording Serv-
ices of Public Recreation Departments, is available from
the National Recreation Association at fifty cents a copy.
Recreation departments not familiar with this manual will
do well to secure a copy and consider the advantages of re-
cording their services as followed at Miami Beach.

Addition of New Families

An editorial appearing in the Newsletter of the American
Society of Planning Officials detailed the facilities and serv-
ices required of a city as a result of an addition of one hun-
dred new families. It stated, “The city will have to buy
about four acres of land: one acre for grammar school, one
acre for high school, one acre for parks, and one acre for
playgrounds and playfields.”—The Municipality, August,
1955.

QUESTION: Is your city doing this?

Double Taxation of City Residents

The April, 1955 issue of Popular Government, issued by
the Institute of Government at the University of North Caro-
lina, contains an article by John A. McMahon, assistant di-
rector of the Institute, which discusses the implications in
recent North Carolina cases involving the question of double
taxation. This question is one that has been raised in many

other states. The article points out:

Suppose that a county and city are jointly supporting an activity
serving people throughout the county, such as a county-wide library,
a county-wide health department, or some similar operation. Suppose
further that the county pays fifty per cent of the cost of the activity
and the city pays fifty per cent, and that fifty per cent of the total

DECEMBER 1955

assessed valuation in the county lies within the city. The city tax-
share of the activity, plus fifty per cent of the county’s fifty per cent
share—or seventy-five per cent of the total cost of the activity.

This situation exists in many counties throughout the
country.

Reference is made to a 1953 case which involved a pro-
posal for a city and county to erect a building for their joint
use, the project to be originally financed by a city bond
issue. The Supreme Court held that the question at issue
was whether the issuance of bonds by the city to pay the
total cost of the erection of a building in the city for the
joint use of city and county was necessary expense of the
city and it answered this question in the negative. “While
the court did not specifically say so, the issue might be put
this way: the city was to issue its bonds for a structure to
house city activities, which is a necessary expense; but the
city was also to issue its bonds for a structure to house
county activities, and this is not a necessary expense for a
city.” The court implied that the project might have been
valid had it been approved by the voters of the city, or if
the project had been financed by non-tax city revenues.

The question of taxation was not raised in the case, but
the court in its opinion cited American Jurisprudence and
said, “It is clear that one taxing district, whether state,
county, municipality, or district established for the particu-
lar purpose, cannot be taxed for the benefit of another dis-
trict.” The court also quoted from a Kentucky decision
which seemed to suggest that joint support of an activity
by a county and city from tax refunds was unconstitutional
because it violated the uniformity rule.

In another North Carolina case a taxpayer sought to re-
strain a city and county from issuing bonds to erect and
equip public library buildings and to collect taxes to pay
debt service on the bonds. Under a special act of the Gen-
eral Assembly the county planned to issue $800,000 in bonds
and the city an additional $800,000 for the purpose of add-
ing to the library facilities in the city and elsewhere in the
county. The proposed county bonds had been approved by
the voters of the county and the city bonds by the voters of
the city. The plaintiff pointed out that seventy-five per cent
of the assessed valuation of the county lay inside the city
limits so the citizens of the city would, in effect, pay eighty-
seven per cent of the debt service on the bonds.

The_court held that there was no double taxation in the
case for one tax would be imposed by the city and another
by the county. It noted that “double taxation is neither
prohibited by the state nor federal constitutions, though
the courts do not look upon it with favor.” It was further
noted that the general law authorizes two or more counties
or municipalities, or a county or counties and a municipal-
ity or municipalities, to join to establish a free public li-
brary. Furthermore, the citizens of the city, who were
alleged to be doubly taxed, had voted for the issuance of
the bonds. The court said: “Under our government ultimate
sovereignty is vested in the people, and they alOne can say
how they shall be governed.” Joint support from taxes, ac-
cording to the case, is not double taxation, and even if it
were there is nothing in the federal or state constitutions
to prevent it. ‘9’

The Goals 0 Management

Although delivered to the 40th Annual Confer-—
ence of International City Managers” Association,
this address is in large part applicable to the ad-
ministration of recreation and park departments.

FOR FORTY years I have watched the
careers of city managers, and have
struggled with management myself, in-
side and outside of government, at all
levels of administration, federal, state,
and local. I think the true goals for
which the managers have been striving
may be stated as follows: To make our
conduct of affairs technically sound,
politically responsible, publicly accept-
able, professionally approved, and so-
cially constructive. I will venture to

elaborate on each of these five points'

briefly.

Technical Soundness

We live in an age of technology and
continually advancing application of
scientific discoveries. Managers know
that they have the responsibility for
drawing on all of these advancing tech-
nologies in the public service. It is the
managers who must find the method
for bringing to the service of the city
dweller the best in engineering, public
health, social work, utility manage-
ment, public architecture, accounting,
procurement, crime control, traflic reg-
ulations, fire protection and prevention,
p r o p e r t y maintenance, institutional
management, tax administration, hud-
geting, planning and zoning, personnel
administration, legal service, and re-
porting—to name only the major areas
of technical expertise involved in mod-
ern city management.

DR. GULICK, city administrator for the
City of New York and former president
of the Institute of Public Administra-
‘tion, is chairman of the National Coun-
cil-on Research in Recreation of the
National Recreation Association.

482

The city manager not only makes it
his goal to see that his city makes good
use of these technical arts, but that he
personally keeps himself and his top
staff acquainted with the new develop-
ments, through professional association
meetings, visits to places where prom-
ising experiments are going on, refresh-
er courses, and time set aside for dis-
cussion and reading.

A high level of efficiency and econ-
omy is one of the most emphasized tech-
nical services of the good manager. At
this point we share the drives of the
private business manager.

We define economy not in terms of
cash proiit but as the doing of the ap-
propriate job with the least use of men,
materials, and time, measured over
something more than a single month or
year. Our definition must include hu-
man factors such as the morale of the
public employees and the desires and
reactions of the community. Within
these limits the good manager is always
looking for better methods and places
to save and to cut taxes. But he will not
willingly accept fake economies, like the
postponement of maintenance, decep-
tive accounting, or the victimizing of
the public employees.

In the search for technical soundness

‘in administration, the manager can

make no contribution half so important
as he makes through the selection and
recruitment of men and women of abil-
ity to fill the posts of his top and middle
management. This must be done with
a ruthless devotion to quality and char-
acter. One good selection in such ap-
pointments brings in its train years,
even decades, of growing competence;
and one inferior appointment guided

Luther Gulick

more by politics or personal considera-
tions than by merit brings years, even
decades, of mediocrity and contagious
inferiority.

When it comes to the modernization
of equipment, indoors and outdoors,
managers are, of course, restrained
from immediately adOpting every new
development and every new efficiency
gadget by budget and other considera-
tions.

Political Responsibility

Our second goal is political respon—
sibility. City managers have a profound
duty to the city council which appoints
them, and to the community in which
they work, for complete political in-
tegrity.

I don’t mean by this personal, money
honesty. This goes without saying; and
it is interesting at a time when people
are talking about drawing up a “code
of ethics” for congressmen and state
legislators that no one questions the
basic human honesty and vigorous con-
sciences of city managers. For thirty
years the city managers have had and
lived by a published “Code of Ethics.”

When I talk about political integrity
I mean the clear recognition of the true
status of the city manager in the Ameri-
can political framework. The manager-
is not  political boss; he is not con-
cerned with building political power or
gaining his ends through deception and
the manipulation of the electorate. The
managcr does not reach for political re--
sponsibility and leadership, intoxi-
eating as are such powers for most men.

Condensed and reprinted from Public Man-
agement, the official journal of the Interna-
tional City Managers’ Association, January
1955. ‘

RECREA'TION

The manager is the honest and de-
voted agent of the politically responsi-
ble appointment power. The public
manager who has contempt for the dif-
ficult role of the politician and elected
official is in the wrong profession. On
entering his profession the public man-
ager implicitly subscribes to a faith in
the general efficacy of our system of
elected political leadership and respon-
sibility.

This does not prevent him from do-
ing all in his power to guide and inform
his council, or mayor, or board, on
technical matters and on matters of
policy. But on questions dominated by
political considerations, he refrains
from going beyond factual and admin-
istrative matters, and he does not carry
his differences to the public even
through underhanded channels. He rec-
ognizes the right of the electorate to
choose seemingly unqualified officials;
he recognizes and respects the right of
politically responsible officials to make
blunders or to adopt policies which may
seem to him technically unsound.

The manager has also a responsi-
bility to the community as a whole. He
has the duty to inform and educate the
public particularly on technical and ad-
ministrative matters and to maintain
professional and technical standards.

The public administrator must strive
to be sufficiently wise to realize that in-
forming and educating the public about
the substance of better management
and administration can and should
have a salutary effect on the judgment
of an electorate. And for that reason
he must not shirk his duty for fear he
will be charged with a violation of po-
litical neutrality. But wisdom in this
twilight zone of managerial responsi-
bility will tell him when and how to
speak. And it will tell him when he
must suffer in silence, awaiting the
more pr0pitious moment to speak his
piece.

I know from experience and from
long years of observation and consulta-
tion how difficult it is to draw the line
I am here laying down. But I know also
that the great managers have done it,
and they have never lost sight of the
goal of contributing to a higher stand-
ard of political responsibility in their
long service to their communities.

DECEMBER‘ 1955

Public Acceptance

Public acceptance is- the third major
goal and is closely related to what we
have just been discussing. Managers
not only want to be popular and well
received in their communities. They
want the public to look upon them as
people do upon other top level business
managers, lawyers, engineers, educators
and productive servants of the commu-
nity. To achieve this, managers must
not only do a good 01) technically, and
within the boundaries of political re-
sponsibility, they must “let their light
so shine that men may see their good
works.”

This means, in practical terms, good
reporting—an art in which city man-
agers have always led the country —
and a reasonable attention to friendly
and informative relations with the civ-
ic, commercial, labor, educational, re-
ligious, and news-disseminating agen-
cies of the community. This takes time
and must not be undertaken with the
left hand as a nuisance. It must be
scheduled and prepared for and kept
out of politics.

And may I add this: Good public re-
lations is not a bag of tricks like putting
on a sales campaign for a new break-
fast cereal. Cood public relations must
be built into any activity or program.
The program itself must be good; it
must be honest; it must be developed
with the genuine cooperation of those
to whom it is to be “sold” and with
those who will be called on to admin-
ister; and the affected public must have
the opportunity to learn, consider, and
weigh the factual technical basis 'for
new programs and policies before they

. are called upon to approve or condemn.

For these reasons public acceptance is
not an afterthought to be handled by
a smart press secretary; it is a basic
goal of administration. continually in
the mind of management. In this sense
the public manager is both teacher and
student in the perpetual town meeting
of a civic and community discussion
and decision.

Professional Approval

Professional approval is quite a dif-
ferent matter and involves not only our
professional equals throughout the
country, but also the leaders of other
professions as well.

Few people appreciate the full signi-
ficance of this point until they st0p to
think of what is happening in the mod-
ern world. With each decade mankind
is deve10ping .more and more highly
compartmentalized s ci e n ti fi 0 k n 0 W] -
edge; from this comes more and more
highly differentiated technology; and
from this arise the many varieties of
specialists, not alone in medicine, chem-
istry, physics, engineering, and so on,
but also in the increasingly skilled
service trades.

All of these professions and skills
work for all of us, for society as a
whole. They fix our teeth, our hearts,
our nerves, our bones; our automo-
biles; our TV’s; our homes; they give
us pure water and air; they build
bridges, and roads, and factories, and
power plants; and they cart off our
wastes. They manufacture and distrib-
ute goods. They protect us, educate us,
clothe us, feed us, shelter us, entertain
us, and they shrive our souls and in the
end lay us to rest with our forefathers,
who did most of these things for them-

selves.
The common man, and we are all

common men in most of our activities,
cannot know anything about the techni-
cal adequacy of the services performed
by all of these experts, though we do
have a pretty good judgment of end re-
sults and retain the right to pass on

these.
Who then sets the defined standards

of professional and technical service?
There is no one who can do this except
the profession itself. It is the doctors
who set the standards for the doctors;
the lawyers and judges for the law; the
engineers for engineering; accountants
for accounting; educators for teaching;
and managers for management. That
is why it is not only right, it is impera-
tive for us to be deeply concerned that
we may deserve the approbation of our
peers. Adherence to the standards of
the recognized profession which goes
with professional approval, is the de-
vice by which a highly differentiated
and technological community main-
tains the responsibility of each profes-
sion toward society as a whole.

Many years ago one of ‘the wisest
public leaders, administrators, and
military geniuses I have ever known,

the late Jan Smuts of South Africa, said

483;

to me, “The use and control of the ex-
pert is the greatest problem of our gen-
eration.”

How can our society give such trust
to the experts, when the- common man
can’t possibly understand what the spe-
cialists are doing? I suggest that the
answer is found in three controls: first,
the ultimate judgment of results by
mankind in a free, competitive, and
democratic society; second, the cura-
tive force of continuous professional
research; and third, the development
of standards by the responsible profes-
sions.

This does not mean that the profes-
sions can hold themselves sacrosanct in
the face of public criticism. To be re-
sponsible is to nourish and keep semi-
nal the channels of communication be-
tween profession and society. Failure
in this invites degradation of the pro-
fessions. The failure of one profession
affects us all. A concept of service and
devotion to the search for new truth is
the common element that binds pro-
fessions together.

Value to Society

The long-range human test of man-
agement is value to society. It is there-
fore the final goal of management to be

socially constructive. There are so many
angles to this thought that I can only
touch on a few suggestive points here.

The whole idea of city government is
one of service and _c00perative en-
deavor. Human beings cannot live in
urban congestion and enjoy the eco-
nomic service and cultural benefits of
close association without limiting an-
archy. And, at the same time, we want
to preserve the maximum of freedom
for the individual to fulfill his poten-
tialities. We therefore not only want
our service to be well thought of and to
be approved by our peers; we want it to
be of value to our communities and to
mankind in the long quest for social
betterment.

Wherein lies the distilled essence of
this contribution, the unique service
performed for mankind by manage-
ment? Is there such a contribution?
Surely, we know there is. What is it?

I say this contribution, this unique
service, is found in the application to
human affairs of the skills of advance
programing in public affairs, organ-
izing, staffing, delegating, directing, co-
ordinating, budgeting, reporting, and
holding public servants accountable to
their assignment and true to their trust.
Through these processes of administra-

STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP

tion, the manager brings the services of
the expert to society and not only holds
in balance the competing activities of
government but relates the entire enter-
prise to the resources and desires of the
community. This is a service of su-
preme value which cannot be performed
by any other profession or calling.

Deep down in the heart of every pub-
lic manager there is for this reason a re-
ward which goes beyond his pay check.
beyond the applause or blame, beyond
the feeling that something done was
sound and efficient, the still small voice
which says that which you have done
this day is worth doing for mankind.
You have used your special skills and
energy, your knowledge and faith, in
making life better, not for personal rea-
sons of vanity, power or gain, but be-
cause as a human being you find satis-
faction in serving mankind.

It was this feeling which Abraham
Lincoln had in mind when he said to a
group which sought to dissuade him
from finishing the war in 1864: “I de-
sire so to conduct the affairs of this ad-
ministration that if at the end, when I
lay down the reins of power, I have lost
every other friend on earth, I shall at
least have one friend left, and that
friend shall be down inside me.” *

RECREATION

 

        

o A one-day conference under the auspices of Little League
Baseball, Inc., was held in New York on May 31, 1955 for
the purpose of discussing pr0posed research projects re-
lating to organized competition for young children, particu-
larly Little League Baseball. Suggestions for possible re-
search had been submitted in advance of the conference to
Dr. Creighton J. Hale, the organization’s director of re-
search, who will be responsible for carrying out the pro-
posals ad0pted as a result of the conference. The partici-
pants included representatives of the U. S. Ollice of Educa-
tion, American Medical Association, the National Institute
of Mental Health, the National Recreation Association, and
several eastern universities. Topics discussed included ad-
ministrative problems, with special emphasis on the selec-
tion and training of leaders and physiological, psychologi-
cal, and sociological problems related to the conduct of
competitive sports program for young children.

America’s Needs and Resources—A New Survey

J. Frederic Dewhurst and Associates. New York: The
Twentieth Century Fund, 1955.

A review of the chapter on “Recreation.”

This represents a second presentation of American needs
and resources, the first having appeared in 1947. This chap-
ter is of significance for it reflects the important concern
of the authors for recreation as a basic factor in the eco-
nomic and social fabric of American life. Major emphasis
is placed upon consumer exPenditures for recreation goods
and services, and government expenditures for recreation
on local, state, and national levels.

Consumer exPenditures are presented largely from United
States Department of Commerce data. The authors place
correct emphasis upon recreation expenditures as a vast
segment of the economic prosperity of our nation, and point
out that countless jobs are created as a result of people’s de-
mands for recreation goods and services.

They have difficulty in deciding just what items are to be
included as recreation when computing consumer expendi-
tures. The Department of Commerce is quoted as listing
expenditures for strictly recreation goods and services as
$1,900,000,000 in 1933 and $10,500,000,000 in 1952. With
the addition of government exPenditures of $403,000,000
in 1950 the total reaches $11,000,000,000 even within nar-
rowly defined limits. Vacation travel, listed at $12,000,000,-
000 in 1950, combined with other expenditures—such as
for sports clothes—could easily lift the total to $40,000,-

000,000 in 1950, depending upon what items are included.
Taxes collected on recreation goods and services by the fed-
eral and state governments in 1952 are listed at $915,000,-
000.

The chapter includes very brief historical mention of the
recreation movement rise and cites statistics regarding
trends toward greater participation in the arts, music, and
the theater. Recreation studies in California, Minnesota,
and by the National Recreation Association are drawn upon
for various data.

Regarding government expenditures for recreation, in-
cluding a forecast as to the adequacy of such funds in 1960,

government expenditures amounted to $49,000,000 just
prior to World War I, to over $220,000,000 in 1932 and to
$403,000,000 in 1950. A figure of 38.1 per cent is also cited

as the amount of nation-wide community chest funds al-
located to private or voluntary leisure-time agencies in 1950.
Local governments have spent less than $2.25 per capita for
recreation in 1950 as compared to a recommended $5.00.
The authors are not Optimistic regarding the ability of
government expenditures to catch up with the recreation
needs of the pe0ple. They feel that increased appropriations
for current services will reflect only those sums needed to
meet the costs of increases in the prices of goods and serv-
ices. Their statement that this is a reasonable assumption
based on experience of the past two decades appears to be
open to challenge by those who have been associated closely
with the recreation movement in the past quarter-century.
They feel that any real increases in government eXpendi-
tures will come at the federal level in conjunction with na-
tional park services and similar enterprises. More optimism
is expressed with respect to funds for capital outlays, prin-
cipally owing to needs for playgrounds and playfields for
an ever increasing child population. Their conclusion is
that government expenditures for current recreation needs

will perhaps reach $276,000,000 by 1960, some $124,000,-
000 short of the $400,000,000 they estimate necessary to
meet needs of the public. Likewise an estimated $310,000,-
000 needed for government capital outlays in 1960 will fall
short by $130,000,000.

Although one may be more optimistic regarding the na-
tion’s ability and willingness to narrow the gap between rec-
reation needs and resources than the authors appear to be,
the authors have presented valuable factual information and
have pointed out considerations which should'be reflected
upon by thoughtful recreation professionals—DR. GERALD
B. FITZGERALD, Director of Recreation Training, Depart-
ment of Physical Education and Athletics, University of
Minnesota. *

Life-size figures and living animals in créche outside church.

One of the oldest traditions at St. George’s Episcopal
Church on the lower East Side of New York City is the
“Evening of the People.” On this evening, which is usually
three or four days before Christmas, entire families gather
to decorate the church. As many as fifteen hundred people
have come in response to a gracious invitation. The “wind-
ing of the greens” is begun at 8:30 P.M.

Large wooden frames—which fit the windows—are cov-
ered with chicken wire. Ivy greens are woven in and out
around the wire until it is completely covered. Festoons of
greens are hung along the balconies and behind the choir
loft and are draped over doorways. During the decorating,
the organist plays“ the wonderful traditional Christmas
carols, with the children and adults. singing as they work.

The decorating takes a couple of hours and is done with
great care. When it is finished the church lights are put out,
and while the organist plays the Pastoral Symphony a huge
lighted star is raised very slowly until it reaches the ceiling
just above the altar. The people then sing “We Three Kings
of the Orient Are,” after which the Christmas story is read.

Two little girls dressed as angels come to the altar and
unveil a creche for which they have been responsible. The
other children come slowly down the aisles of the church in
single file, singing “Away in a Manger.” A closing prayer
is given, followed by the singing of “Silent Night.” All the
lights in the church are turned on and everyone goes to the
parish house for coffee and doughnuts.

In addition to the decorations inside the church, a large
creche is set up out-of-doors. The figures used are life-size.
Real animals standing watch by the manger, plus the music
of Christmas carols, serve to remind the community that
Christmas is a festival of joy for all pe0ple.

After fifty-five years, this dramatic and impressive pro-
gram of St. George’s Church is no longer merely tradition.
It has now become a part of New York City folklore.

Your community groups may like to “decorate the
churches”—and in addition they may enjoy taking part in
the decorating of: the community building; the school; the
town square; the courthouse; the hospital; main street;

the museum; the library. (See “Teen-agers Give Oyster Bay

It’s Hanukah

Year many
Jewish young people share in
Christmas celebrations, but

after year,

how many non-Jewish boys
and girls have had an oppor-

 

tunity to know or participate
in Hanukah? This is a Feast of Lights, celebrated by the
people of the Jewish religion at approximately the same time
as those of the Christian faith are celebrating Christmas.
Hanukah lends itself to dramatic presentation, and is one of
the most joyous of the Jewish festivals. The history of
Judas Maccabees is read, for the festival is founded upon
the courage of this man,1 who was leader of his people in a
struggle against pagan altars in the Temple in Jerusalem.
Especially impressive is the traditional lighting of the Men-
orah. One candle is lighted each evening for eight days—
the eight days constituting Hanukah. During this time there
are many gay festivities at which songs are sung, games are
played and gifts are exchanged; parties are numerous and
pancakes and other traditional Jewish foods are served in
the homes. Hanukah plays are given and these are based on
the historical facts concerning the Feast of Lights.

Find a group of young people and adults who are willing
to plan with you and share their traditions with others.
Alternate the telling of the Christmas story, and the Feast
of Lights, in your holiday program. Informal dramatiza-
tions would be effective. Gift giving is a part of both Hanu-
kah and Christmas. Have a grab bag, or exchange inex-
pensive gifts ahead of time; or collect gifts for hospitalizcd
children or shut-ins. A combination of the two festivities
offers endless possibilities.2 ‘5’

All good recreation departments are
constantly re-evaluating their pro-
grams. In Lynchburg, Virginia, in the
fall of 1953, we found ourselves won-
dering if we could not make some fur-
ther contribution to the Christmas sea-
son. We had the Christmas handcraft
program and the neighborhood com-
munity houses held parties and dances;
but the feeling persisted that we should
do something the general public could
enjoy. A community tree and carol
sing in the business district had been
successful years ago; however, the city
fathers frowned upon a revival of this,
as it would tend to tie up traffic.

Various other suggestions were made
and discarded as impractical. Then we
heard of several communities which
held a public burning of the greens. So,
in 1954, Lynchburg revived this ancient

custom. One of the finest things about
the project has been the way three city
departments have worked together to
make it a success. “('9 realized in our
initial planning that we would need the
cooperation of the fire department and
the public service department: this co-
operation we received in full measure.

While tradition held that the greens
should be burned on Twelfth-night, we
felt that it would be more expedient to
hold the event nearer Christmas. In
1954 we held the burning on January
3. Our fire chief strongly advised this
earlier date as the longer the Christmas
greens stay in homes the drier and more
acute fire hazards they become.

All through the week following
Christmas the greens are collected by
the public service department and taken
to the location of the burning, where
they are placed to form a gigantic star
with fifty-foot points extending from a
center one hundred and twenty feet in
diameter. In the center the greens are
piled about fifteen-feet high, tapering to
the points. One man supervises placing
of greens so the star will be uniform.

The first year we used a number of
chemicals on the greens, hoping to
achieve varicolored flames. The colors
did not show up enough to justify the
additional work and expense. It was
decided, the next year, to dispense with

the chemicals.
On the night of the event, the fire de-

partment sends a fire truck to stand by
throughout the evening. The Lynch-
burg life saving crew cooperates by
sending their truck with spotlights to
illuminate the star until it is ignited.
The ceremony is brief but we have
found it effective. A short talk is given
by the mayor or city manager, who
welcomes the spectators and tells some-
thing of the custom of the burning of
the greens. The lire chief then steps for-
ward and hands the speaker a lighted
torch. Five teen-age girls, chosen from
live community houses representing
various parts of the city, are the torch
bearers. They are dressed in white
boots, red slacks, white sweaters, and
colorful stocking caps. Each girl steps
forward, lights her torch from the
mayor’s, and is then escorted by a fire-
man in uniform to a point of the star.
As a fire siren sounds, each girl touches
her torch to her star-point. The greens

ignite rapidly, sending flames as high
as one-hundred feet.

Lynchburg, called “The Hill City,”
has a natural advantage for the project,
because of the terrain. Location of the
burning has been a sanitary fill almost
in the center of a large natural bowl,
making it possible for many people to
witness the event from the hills above.
At the same time, it has made it almost
impossible to get an accurate count of
the number of spectators. While esti-
mates have been made from five to ten
thousand, all that we can say for certain
is that the event has been well received.

The first year, a brilliant shooting
star swept across the sky just as the
torch bearers ignited the greens. Vile
took this to be a good omen for the oc-
casion and felt that many of the spec-
tators did too. {1’

show at Theatre of the Red Rocks
have been wondering how the In-
dian got on top of the huge rock in
one of the show’s breathtaking
scenes. David Abbott, deputy as-
sistant manager of improvements
and parks in Denver gives the
answer:

“We had one of our mountain
climbing buddies belay (rope) the
Indian up the back of the rock be-
fore the performance. He stayed
up there all during the production
—there is a ledge on the back of
the rock—then came down after
the show was over. However, it isn’t
advisable for anyone but an experi-
enced climber to try it.”

the recreation program. She gave the
history of recreation in Sylacauga, be-
ginning with the organization of the
board, the first playground, and so on.

“The talk was so interesting, she was
invited to speak to the Rotary Club and
then the Junior Chamber of Commerce
Auxiliary, the Exchange Club and all
the other clubs in town. New indus-
tries moving to Sylacauga have brought
people from many parts of the United
States. They, as well as the older citi-
zens, have all expressed their interest in
the talk. We think it was tops in pub-
lic relations.”

Facts and Figures

Kansas: In Shields (pop. 35), the Jay- ‘

hawk 4-H Club is making a new road-
side park and picnic site its major con-
servation project. The area, at one time
a fairground, had recently been used as
pasture land. Club members planted
fifty trees and watered them through
the hot summer. The community is
donating a well to help this transfor-
mation along. Picnic tables and facili-
ties are also promised.

Missouri: A 3,200-acre wilderness park,
just ten miles east of Kansas City, is
being developed by Jackson County.
The result of a $3,000,000 bond issue
authorized last August, the park will en-
compass the most scenic spots of the
Little Blue River valley and will include
a 1,000-acre lake for recreation and
conservation purposes.

North Dakota: A recently authorized
bond issue of $130,000 will enable May-
ville (pop. 1,790) to have a new swim-
ming pool by next summer.

The Craftsman’s World

The American Craftsmen’s Educa-
tional Council will sponsor the first
museum to be devoted exclusively to
handcraft exhibitions. The new mu-
seum, which will open in April at 29
West Fifty-third Street, New York City,
will be iinanced through membership
dues from individual craftsmen and
craft groups.

Also in New York City, the Elder
Craftsmen Shop opened recently. This
shop is maintained by the Welfare and
Health Council and is stocked with
handmade high-quality items—to be
sold on a commission basisuproduced
by people over sixty years of age. All
items submitted are screened by a judg-
ing and pricing committee. Advice and
assistance is provided to those whose
articles are not accepted in order to
help them improve the quality of work
so that it will meet the standards.

 

Record Equipment Sales Expected

A record amount of money spent for
“board games” this year is predicted-—~
retail sales are expected to reach $100,-
000,000. Family stay-at-horne evenings,
the high level of economy, and the
greater number of children in the coun-
try are given as main reasons for the
increase of about fifteen per cent over
last year’s sales. Also, an increase in
sporting goods purchases of five per cent
over last year—bringing the total sales
to more than $1,300,000,000—is ex-

pected, according to recent news items

in The New York Times.

Changes in Teaching

The most significant change in
the techniques of teaching is not so
much that teachers have developed
radically new methods of teaching.
It is that the average teacher is now
expected to use techniques former-
ly employed only by the most gifted
and imaginative teachers—New

How “Club ’55” planned a successful party.

WHAT TO DO New Year’s Eve? This is a question that

confronts teen-agers throughout the country. They ask,
“What can we do to have fun, keep out of trouble, and not be
a bother to our parents?”

In Ephrata, Pennsylvania, the teen-agers did something
about it. A representative committee met with the recrea-
tion director and recreation board and was granted permis-
sion to hold a teen-age New Year’s Eve celebration in the
local recreation center. The board went so far as to say
that they would provide a staff to serve the youngsters for
this affair.

Five committees were appointed by the boys’ and girls’
clubs to make the initial plans. Each committee, made up of
two boys and two girls, held a series of meetings; and, at a
mass meeting, the following plans were drawn up:

Ticket Committee. Selected the name of “Club ’55” for

the event. An advance ticket sale, at $1.50 per couple, was
to be held—with a limit of eighty couples. One person from
each couple had to be a student in the high school. Table
reservations could be made for parties of four, six, eight, or

ten. Hours would be from 9:00 P.M. to 1:00 AM. Adults
could visit the club until 9:00 P.M.

Refreshment Committee. The menu included:

Sandwiches
Chicken’s Delight Porky’s Petunia Quaker City Jazz
(Egg salad) (Ham salad) (Cheese)

Beverages (three kinds of punch )
Club ’55 Special
Chips, pretzels and cookies

Teener’s Delight Orange Fizz

The only charge would be five cents for the beverages.

Publicity Committee. Was responsible for the publication

communities to sponsor similar affairs.

Decoration Committee. Under the direction of this com-m
mittee, the center was given the atmosphere of a gala night
club. Theme of the decorations was the old year ushering
in the new year. Soft lighting provided by candles and
colored spotlights brought exclamations of awe from the
many adults who visited the club.

Entertainment Committee. A floor show was planned.
This was divided into two parts. For the first, a professional
comedy team was engaged by our youth council through a
theatrical agency. The reason for a professional act was to
give the youngsters something different and also to add to
the night club atmosphere. The second part featured local
teen talent on a voluntary basis. The selection was easy since
the council decided that each of the boys’« and girls’ clubs
would be responsible for one act. At that time there were
three boys’ and three girls’ clubs. They were limited to six
minutes each. This worked out very well because the friend-
ly rivalry between the clubs stimulated them to try to out-(lo
each other. A similar event is held each year as a post-prom
party following the junior-senior high school prom. -

Gifts to be used as door and novelty dance prizes were
provided by local merchants.

Adult Cooperation. Twenty-six adults served as the stafl
of “Club ’55” in the capacity of waiters, doorman, candy
girls, photo girls, and so on.

Total cost for this event was $151.34, while the income
from admissions and sale of beverages was $148.37. The
teen-age clubs assumed the deficit by holding a bake sale
at a later date.

The entire affair was a success and the idea has spread
to other communities in the county. The teen-agers not only
had a good time, but proved that they can plan and sponsor
good recreation activities without being a burden on the
adults of a community. ‘5?

RECREATION

The “What” and “Why” of
JOB ANALYSIS

IT IS VERY important for any executive
in the field of recreation, for any-
one who has administration responsi-
bilities for that matter, to have a good
insight into the what and why of job
evaluation. If he knows the how as
well, so much the better. The main dif-
ference here is whether you’re inter-
ested in the subject with a view toward
setting up your own job analysis plan,
or whether you are operating under a
plan already set up by the personnel
office or civil service agency.

0 What is job analysis, and how does
it apply in the yield of recreation?

Stripped of all its technical trim-
mings, job analysis is essentially a sys-
tematic plan for studying and record-
ing what each employee does in his
daily work. The end-product is a shries
of written job descriptions or “class
specifications” which are useful in a
variety of ways to various people. It is

used for:

Setting pay iates. Without a system-
atic job analysis plan, any effort to es-
tablish fair, uniform pay rates is under
a tremendous handicap.

Budgeting personal services. If the
job analysis plan is tied in with a uni-
form pay plan, the work of preparing
the annual budget is made far easier
and far more accurate. This is particu-
larly true in a service activity such as
recreation where the item of “personal
services” can be as high as seventy-five
per cent of the total annual budget for
the recreation department.

Organizing the staff. Top manage-
ment and line oflicials can do a far bet-

ter job of staffing the organization and
securing replacements if they ham a
job analysis plan to guide them.

Recruiting personnel. A job analysis
plan is the foundation for any system-
atic approach to recruiting qualified
employees. This is equally true whether
your agency is one operating undcr a
formal civil service system or whether
you have your own personnel program.

Training employees on the job. It is
often necessary to train employees in
the details of their work assignments
after they are actually on the oh. This
is made much easier with a ob analysis

plan.

Evaluating job performance. Unless
management first knows what each em-
ployee is expected to do, how can you
judge how well he does it?

Promotion. A good job analysis plan
will serve as a useful guide to manage-
ment and the personnel office in filling
vacancies by promotion from within
the organization.

A job analysis plan has other uses.
but the ones mentioned will demon-
strate its value. The larger the organi-
zation the more useful such a plan be-
comes, but even a relatively small rec-
reation department can make profitablc
use of job analysis. It is useful to top
management, to “middle management,”
to the budget office, to the personnel
office, and, by no means least, to the
rank-and-file of employees. You may
be surprised to know that there is a di-
rect connection between having a job
analysis plan and having good employ-
ee morale.

o What Is a Job-Analysis Plan?

We are using the term “job analysis” -

here, but there are also several other
terms covering practically the samc
thing, which are used both in the pub-
lic service and in private business, such

0 O 0 J. J. Donovan

as “job evaluation,” “point rating."
“f - 5: cc- - .

i n g , 5 9
This last term, position classification.

and “position classification.”

is the one most widely used in the pub-
lic service to describe the process of job
analysis. In fact, you will find refcr-
ence in many civil service laws and
rules to such phrases as the “classified
service” and the “unclassified service.”
This simply means, in civil service lan-
guage, that jobs which are under civil
service are covered by a position-classi-
fication plan, and that jobs which arc
not under civil service are “unclassi-
fied” or not included in the classifica-
tion plan. j

In its essential form, a job analysis
plan is a set of written descriptions or
“class specifications” each one of which
describes a particular kind of job or set
of duty assignments. These class speci-
fications are prepared in accordance
with some standard format, decided 011
in advance to facilitate comparisons be-
tween one job class and another. Al-
though you will find some variations in
the format of class specifications from
one job analysis plan to another, here
are some of the typical major parts of a
written class specification:

1. A Standard job title. The title

should be as accurately descriptive as
possible in a few words. If there is more
than one level of difficulty, or more than
one area of specialization in the particu-
lar job “family,” this should be reflect-
ed in the title.

2. A general statement of the duties of
the job and where it jits in the organi-
zation’s structure. This is usually a
brief, broad statement couched in gen-
eral terms.

3. Supervision received and supervi-
sion exercised. Where the employee
gets his instructions or orders, whether
they are in general or detailed form,

491

r—m77nmmm'o

how much discretion he exercises on his
own, and the extent, if any, to which
he in turn supervises the work of others.

4. Typical duties. This part of the job
specification pictures the employee in
action. It tells specifically what he does
in concrete terms and gives enough il-
lustrations of his everyday work assign-
ments so that you can get the “feel” of

the job.

5. Job qualifications. What the em-
ployee needs in the way of training,
practical experience, aptitudes and
skills, qualities of personality and phy-
sique, to do his job adequately.

Each class specification in the plan
can cover anywhere from a single,
unique job performed by only one em-
ployee to a job being performed by two,
ten, or a hundred employees. The class
specification for the head of the organ-
ization is obviously a one-man job. In
the same organization, however, there
may be thirty or forty employees who
are all doing the work of a playground
leader. The irnportant consideration is
that each employee’s job should carry a
standard job title which tells with rea-
sonable accuracy what his current du-
ties are. It is natural, of course, for
employees to think that their job and
the way they do it is different from that
of everyone else in the organization.
That is where some of the headaches
arise in administering a job analysis
plan.

0 The “Whatnot” of Job Analysis

This is a pretty good term to describe
some of the things I have in mind, be-
cause you will find that it is a lot like
those little “whatnot” shelves that used
to stand in our grandmothers’ parlor—

full of odds and ends. These whatnots -

include some” things which cause trouble
in developing and using a job analysis
plan:

Confusing a job analysis plan with
an “eficiency” survey. While the two
are related, they are quite distinctly
different. A job analysis plan is in-
tended to describe what the employee
is doing—not why he is doing it or
even whether he ought to be doing it at
all. Management, of course, should be
continually on the alert to eliminate
duplication and unnecessary activities
and to improve work methods. If you
think that a job analysis plan will auto-

492

matically do this for you, however, you
will probably be disappointed.

Setting up job classes that are too
narrow. This results from an overem-
phasis on minor differences between
two or more closely similar jobs. The
host of special job titles which result
produces a rigid and inflexible organi-
zational structure. While the employee
may at first be highly pleased that his
own particular job has been recognized
by a special title, the ultimate effect on
employee morale can be a bad one.
“Over-classification” results in many
dead-end jobs, narrow lines of promo-
tion, and an incentive to specialize to
the detriment of the employee and the
organization. '

“U nder-classijication.” This, the re-
verse of the above, consists of relatively
few class specifications, which are so
broad as to be practically meaningless.
While this does not occur as often as
over-classification, it is also something
to guard against. It happens when two
or more jobs which are really quite un-
alike are classified together ostensibly
to simplify things.

“fob qualifications” versus “person-
nel standards.” Because this is a com-
plicated subject in itself, I mention it
only briefly here. The “job qualifica-
tions” which are pr0perly a part of a
sound class specification are related es-
sentially to a particular kind of job as it
exists in a particular organization. Job
qualifications, realistically described,
take into account several environmental
factors, such as the general manpower
situation in the locality and the com-
petitive position of the employer in bid-
ding for available talent. During the
last fifteen years we have learned many
useful lessons about manpower supply
and demand and the convertability of
occupational skills.

In setting up a job analysis plan, job
qualifications can be pitched at one of
two levels—at the “minimum” or’ at
the “desirable” level. In describing
minimum qualifications, you say, in ef-
fect: “This is the absolute minimum it
takes to do the job; anyone lacking

 these qualifications won’t do.” In writ-

ing desirable job qualifications, on the
other hand, you say in efiect: “While
someone who has less than these quali-
fications might do the job fairly well,

we’d like to hire people with qualifica-
tions like these—or even better.”

The difficulty arises when qualifica-
tions written into a class specification
are actually neither “minimum” nor
“desirable,” but are closer to “ideal.”
There is real danger that setting the
sights so high will turn out to be a boom-
erang when it actually comes to recruit-
ing people. Perhaps the starting salary
is rather modest; maybe you can’t hire
non-residents of the city; maybe the
“dream” employee you have pictured
turns out to be a mirage. Moreover, the
people who are actually available. may
be scared away by the job qualifications
that have been set up.

When you deal with jobs which are
essentially professional or technical in
developing a job analysis plan, the sub-
ject of “personnel standards” often
comes up and becomes the center of
much, debate between the Operating de-
partment and the personnel office. On
the one hand, there is the commendable
desire to set such standards at a high
level. There is a related urge to write
them in terms of specific amounts and
kinds of formal educational training
and work exPerience. The inescapable
implication, whether intentional or oth-
erwise, is that a man or woman who
lacks these qualifications, even by a
narrow margin, is unqualified for the
job and should not be hired. Maybe
that’s not the intent at all, but the prac-
tical effect depends a lot upon how high
and how narrow those standards are.

The situation is somewhat altered,
however, when a civil service agency is
using a set of job qualifications to set
up its examining process. Under a typi-
cal merit system, the central personnel
ofiice has two tasks to perform in re-
cruiting employees. First, it should
screen out job applicants who are ob-
viously not able to handle the work for
any one of many reasons. Then, among
those who are found to be qualificd, it
is necessary to rank them in the order
of their competence. Neithcr of these is
an easy task, and the fewer jobs there
are to be filled, the harder they become.

To do this dual task well, the per-
sonnel agency must use sound examin-
ing methods and rating procedures,
working in close harmony with the peo-
ple in the operating dcpartments. When

RECREATION

the personnel agency does a good job l

it stands to reason that the applicants
who have the best all-around qualifica-
tions will come out highest in the com-
petitive process. It all points to this
conclusion: We can’t rely only on paper
job qualifications to attain and main-
tain high personnel standards. It takes
good working conditions, aggressive
and widespread recruiting, and thor-
ough personnel selection methods. If
you have them, the good people, like
cream, will float to the top.

Letting the plan become obsolete.
This last whatnot of job analysis may
sound so obvious to you that it hardly
bears mentioning. Yet it is surprising
how many personnel problems in an or-
ganization can stem from letting the
job analysis plan get way out of date.
If Jim Brown’s job assignment is
changed substantially, if Jane Green is
given an informal promotion from
front-office typist to the boss’s personal
secretary, these are changes which
should be recognized in the job analysis
plan. Maybe there’s nothing involved
but a change of title; maybe there is a
pay increase as well; and maybe there
is a formal competitive promotion to
go through. But no matter what may be
involved, the job analysis plan should
keep abreast of these changes which
happen time and again in any dynamic,
human organization. Some authorities
recommend a complete review of the
job analysis plan every four or five
years, as well as the intermittent ad-
justments which are made necessary by

spot changes in the job assignments of
individual employees. ‘5?

The Hospital Section of the 37th Na-

tional Recreation Congress in Denver
was a happy instructive period for many
hospital recreation workers. Our only
complaint was the beautiful Colorado
scenery surrounding us, which some-
times made us wish the sessions weren’t
so fascinating.

Dr. Morton Bard, psychologist at
Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied
Diseases, New York City, opened the
meeting with a strong and inspiring
talk on “The Role of Recreation in Re-
lieving the Anxieties of Patients.” Dr.
Bard stressed the importance of the per-
sonality of the worker in dealing with
the patients in helping to allay the fears
that the hospital imposes upon an indi-
vidual.

In the afternoon, a singularly suc-
cessful session, “Unusual Recreation

| Activities,” was chaired by Dorothy

Taaffe, recreation consultant, Ameri-
can Red Cross, San Francisco. The en-
tire group divided into six different sec-
tions—neuro-psychiatric, general med-
ical and surgical, tuberculosis, geriat-
ric, children’s and chronic hospitals.
Each had a chairman and a reporter.
Each chairman presented several differ-

ent new program ideas to his group and,

encouraged others to do the same. At
the end of thirty minutes, Miss Taaffe
asked all of those wishing to participate
in more than one group to change
groups. At the end of an hour and a
half, almost unwillingly, the entire
group reassembled and the reporters of
each gave‘a résumé of the ideas pre-
sented. A wonderful rapport and ex-
change of ideas flowed in each division.
This session could have gone on much
longer as enthusiasm was so high. In

‘ the published 1955 Congress Proceed-
L ings, you will be able to read the many

unusual ideas brought out.

The following afternoon, an interest-
ing session on “What’s Your Problem,”
was conducted by Clifford C. Bream,
Jr., chief, Recreation Division, Special
Services, Veterans Administration,
Washington, D. C., and an eminent
panel from hospitals of various types.
The chairman and panel served as clini-
cians and endeavored to answer many
pressing recreation problems brought
up by the clinic group.

That evening, a preliminary report
was given by Dr. Edith Ball of New
York University, on the results of a
study made by the National Recreation
Association and New York University
on the value of recreation for chroni-
cally ill and aged. This column in the
next few months will report on these
results. That same evening, the film,
formerly titled So Much For So Little
but now changed to Rx Recreation, was
shown to a very enthusiastic audience.
0 Briefly, I’d like to call attention to:

1. A fine book with a great deal of
recreation guidance for us all, Hand-
book of Hospital Psychiatry, by Dr.
Louis Linn, published by International
Universities Press, Inc., 227 West 13th
Street, New York, New York. 310.00.

2. An institute dealing with the prob-
lems of the aged, ill, and handicapped
which is being sponsored by the Na-
tional Recreation Association and

New York University on January 18th,
19th and 20th. It will be held at Van-

derbilt Hall, New York University, New
York City.

3. Our movie, Rx Recreation, which
had its first showing to the general pub-
lic at Memorial Hospital for Cancer and
Allied Diseases, New York City. We
had three hundred hospital administra-
tors, psychiatrists, doctors and direc-
tors of philanthropic, civic and frater-
nal groups at the premiere. The picture
was extremely well received. ‘3‘

RECREATION?

 

TV and Children’s Posture

“Children view television on an aver-
age of four hours a day, with their eyes
glued to the screen. This robs them of
four to six hours of valuable time which
they should spend in play, strengthen-
ing their muscles, ligaments and lungs,”
.states Dr. A. L. Schultz in the Septem-
ber issue of Healthways. “They sit in
a TV~squat with the legs spread out-
ward, bending forward with elbows on
knees, and usually with their heads par-
tially supported by the flattened thumb
against the roof of the mouth and
against the back of the upper teeth.
When such postural atrocities are main-
tained for hours, they cannot help weak-
ening the muscles and ligaments of the
ankles, knees, and back, not to mention
the possible deformity to the mouth,
gums, and teeth.”

Using figures secured from audio-
visual authorities and experts in the
Los Angeles area, Dr. Schultz showed
that children spend more time in front
of the TV set than in front of a teacher,
and that little care is exercised in con-
trolling the posture of the child at the
time the TV shows are being scanned.
Spinal misalignments may develop and
proper posture becomes a difficult
matter.

“Everyone from child to adult is af-
flicted with TV ‘rideitis,’ ” he con-
tinues; “we must offset our modern
way of living with more physical educa-
tion. The dividends in national health
and productivity would be immeasur-
able when these children mature. A
healthy nation is productive.”

Television: A World Survey

During the past two years, the num-
ber of television stations in the world
has tripled. There are now 570 stations,
located in 38 countries, as against 27
countries in 1953, and they serve a

world total of 42,000,000 receivers
(24,700,000 in 1953).

These facts are revealed in a new

UNESCO survey completed in Febru-

DECEMBER 1955

ary 1955 and published as Supplement
1955 to the earlier handbook Television,
A World Survey.

The supplement also gives informa-
tion about plans to introduce television
broadcasting in an additional twenty
countries and thus covers a total of
fifty-eight countries, on every continent,
which are concerned in one way or an-
other with television.

Educational television is
strides in areas formerly covered ex-
clusively by commercial broadcasting,
while commercial television is making
inroads in countries where non-com-
mercial broadcasting held a monopoly.
Columbia and Venezuela have govern-
ment-controlled non-commercial tele-
vision systems; and other Latin Ameri-
can countries, such as Costa Rica and
Uruguay are planning the introduction
of educational television broadcasting.
On the other hand, commercial tele-
vision is being established in the United
Kingdom and along the borders of

making

France, while other European countries -

are also discussing the possible intro-
duction of commercial sponsorship to
finance this costly new medium of com-

munication. (UNESCO)
Education TV Spurs Adult

Education

The adult education movement, which
has been termed “an educational
revolution” and “the most significant
educational idea of this generation,” is
given substantial impetus by the recent
opening of noncommercial educational
television stations in two of the na-
tion’s largest cities, Chicago and De-
troit. This brings the total of ETV sta-
tions now Operating to seventeen—with
eight more planning to go on the air
within the next few months, according
to Robert R. Mullen, executive director
of the National Citizens Committee for
Educational Television. “Courses range
from academic ones for credit and cul-
tural subjects to instruction in crafts
and hobbies. The potential for this

service by educational stations can be
gauged by the fact that according to
some estimates 50,000,000 Americans
are participating in some phase of
adult education.”

effort, and provide dramatic play.

Making these toys and games can be

ice groups can c00perate in the toy
making, dividing Up for individual
skills, like sewing, woodworking, cut-

Soccer Illustrated

Frank F. DiClemente.. A. S. Barnes
& Company, 232 Madison Avenue,
New York 16. P. 204. $3.003“

With the game of soccer increasing
in pOpularity in the United States, it is
appropriate that there should be a new
book presenting the fundamentals and
techniques of playing it. The author
gives methods of handling the ball.
kicking, heading, and so on, details of
offensive and defensive team play, and
a wide variety of play situations with
accompanying diagrams. It is strange,
however, that while he states in his in-
troduction, “Soccer can be played by
boys of all ages and sizes,” he says nary
a word about the girls. This is a good
girls’ game, too, Mr. DiClementel Ask

men physical education instructors.

Music in Recreation—Social
Foundations and Practices

Mai Kaplan, Ph.D. Stipes Publish-
ing Company, I7 Taylor Street, Cham-
paign, Illinois. Pp. 230. $3.90.

This volume, whose author has had
a long and broad experience both in
music and in sociology, is based upon
a deep belief in the value of music as
recreation and concern for the recrea-
tion leader who is eager to give music
its due' place in the program yet is un-
trained in its techniques.

Starting with a sound basic concept
of play as enrichment of the life of man,
the author has no difficulty in recog-
nizing both a social and anaesthetic
function for music. Thus he is able to
give sympathetic attention to music at
every level.

Theory is followed by practical help

1n many areas: the recreation center.
the summer camp, hospital, prison, and
community. Proceeding to more spe-
cific needs, the book covers matters of
budget and equipment. 9

In the section on the playing of three
simple instruments, the harmonica, bot-
tle and jug, and autoharp are discussed.
Here the basic educational approach is
again stressed. “It is a serious misin-
terpretation of the place of music in
recreation to hold that standards need
be neglected in favor of enthusiasm or
other psychological or social benefits.”

Eight appendices add greatly to the
value of the book, providing bibliogra-
phy, elements of music theory, reper-
toire of classic records. It is a great
service to the recreation movement to
bring together in one volume so much
practical help and inspiration.-——Edna

sultation Service, NRA.

There is great interest in recreation

Each year board sessions at the Nation-

this one can provide a great deal of
help. For all the differences between
the operations of school boards and
those of boards in the recreation and
park field, there are nevertheless many
similarities and much can be gained
from study of school board operations,
organization, functions, powers and re

Underwater Activities

Underwater Sport by Albert Vanderko-
gel and Rex Lardner. Henry Holt and

Company, 383 Madison Avenue, New
York 17. Pp. 188. $3.50.

An interesting and unusual “encyclo-
pedia” of underwater sport, which in-
cludes accurate information on equip-
ment and techniques of spear fishing,
skin diving, and underwater photogra-
phy to inform the beginner and assist
the expert. It devotes a chapter to ma-
rine life, and one to where to go for
good hunting.

Albert Vanderkogel is one of Ameri-
ca’s experts on underwater equipment
and techniques. Rex Lardner is a New
Yorker reporter, book reviewer and au-
thor. Particularly interesting, too, is
the chapter devoted to the history of
diving. We are told that Mark An-
thony, the Roman general, orator, had a
fishing contest with the reigning queen
of Egypt, Cleopatra. Thucydides tells
us of divers being used- at the siege of
Syracuse in 333 B. C.

In 1945 the number of sport divers
were in the hundreds; today there are
over a million. The International Un-
derwater Spearfishing Association is
located in the Los Angeles County Mu-
seum, and has been organized to give
sport divers a voice in legislation con-
cerning underwater activities, to for-
malize rules and conduct for the sport,
and to pass approval on recordbreak-
ing activities.

There are now two major sport
diving magazines; “The Skin Diver,’
published in Lynwood California, and
“The Waterbug,” published in Clear-
water, Florida.

Illustrations of the book include pho-
t0graphs and line drawings. Appen-
dices include listing of dealers in sport-

The Indian’s Secret World

Robert Hofsinde (Gray-Wolf) . Wil-
liam Morrow & Company, Inc., Publish-
ers, 425 Fourth Avenue, New York 16.

Pp. 94. $3.95.*

Here is Indian lore at its best with
a combination of fine stories and au-
thentic material presented in capti-
vating style. Beautiful illustrations in
full color and in black and white deco-
rate every page and add distinction to
this book. Any youngster (ten years
and up) who enjoys identifying him-
self with the Indian will get a full meas-
ure of enjoyment from these pages.

For a leader, this book has values
beyond its storytelling features. The
twelve tales, each of a different tribe.
use a fiction approach to make facts
come alive. They capture the imagina-
tion and have enormous possibilities
for 'program use: Objects such as the
tepee, war bonnet, owner sticks, medi-
cine pipe, beaded moccasms, mask,
Katchina doll, and medicine shield had
deep significance, for the Indian. The
making of each was accompanied by
symbolism and carefully planned_cere-
mony. This book explains the hidden
meanings of these things and gives a
clear picture of the way in which these
objects were made.

Each chapter is complete in itself
with a dramatic story, craft ideas, sug-

gestions for a pageant, ceremony or
council fire, and the historical back-

ground about each tribe of Indians.
Many of the marginal designs such as
the twelve moons can be reproduced in
the craft program as wall placqnes or
as decorations for the council ring.

The author is a superb storyteller, as
well as a gifted painter and craftsman,

and is known as Gray-Wolf to camp-
ing and recreation people. He has mi-
tiated many Indian lore programs In
camps and recreation organlzatlons.

A portfolio of color prints from the
illustrations of The Indian’s Secret

World may be purchased separately.
They have a decorative value for camp,
club or home—Shirley Silbert, instruc-
