CONCEPT

PCA tquipment encourages creative,
imaginative play by suggesting dra-
mat'it.‘ settings such as treetops, jungles
and space ships. It provides all types of
exercise . . stimulating the child to do
the moving insread of the equipment.
Individual PCCA pieces handle large
groups of children at one time . . result-
ing in lower cost per playing cbiid . .
and substantial savings in land. The
absence of free-swinging, moving ele-
ments eliminates accident hazards. Cor-
rosion-resisrant materials and compacr
plans keep maintenance to a minimum.

PCA Playscapes are complete, com-
paCt "packaged" landscaped play-
grounds for 65 to 250 or more children
— including preselecred equipment,
site plan, typical specihcations, all in-
srallation drawings. Long range play-
ground plans are developed for any
budget to include initial site prepara-
tion, a basic equipment selection and
subsequent additions on a piece or
group basis.

What would

were faced with

 

these situations in your

recreation department?

. . . There is little contact between teen-agers of low

income housing develapments and those living out-
side in a middle-income neighborhood despite the

fact that both groups attend the some high school.
Mutual distrust threatens to lead to serious antago-
nism, and the community appeals for your help.

. . . A Nisei (Japanese-American) club of 15 to 17
year-old bays runs into frequent conflict with a group
of Nisei, Negro and Mexican Americans from an-
other area. Both groups were vying for prestige, and
the friction between them results in serious fighting.

A WORD of WELCOME ——

WELCOME TO Chicago and the 41st National Recreation

Congress! I extend this welcome to you personally, as

a native of Chicago; on behalf of the Board of Direc-
tors and staff of the National Recreation Association, as
the Association’s executive director; and on behalf of the
Congress Policy'Committee, as chairman for the 1959 Con-
gress. As you know, this year’s meeting is sponsored by
the National Recreation Association and the American Rec-
reation Society, with cooperation of the Chicago Board of
Education, Chicago Park District, Council for the Advance-
ment of HOSpital Recreation, Federation of National Pro-
fessional Organizations for Recreation, Illinois Association
of Park Districts, Illinois Recreation Association, and the
Illinois State Physical Education, Health, and Recreation
Association.

To Charles B. Cranford, president of the American Rec-
reation Society, who serves as vice-chairman of the Con-
gress Policy Committee, and to the other members of that
committee; to Jesse Reynolds, president-elect of the So-
ciety, who serves as chairman of the Congress Program
Committee, and to the other members of that committee;
to the many other loyal, hardworking committee and sub-
committee members who have done the detailed planning
and work for the many sessions; to the Chicago Commit-
tee of the National Recreation Association, and t0 the
many sponsors and good friends of the Association in
the Chicago area; to you who arc the speakers, panel mcm-
hers, recorders, and participants in thc Congress; and last,
but not least, to Willard Stone, the Congress secretary, and
to the staff mcmhcrs of the National Recreation Associa-
tion and American Recreation Society serving the Congress,
go the thanks of all of us for making possible what I know
will be the most outstanding of all National Recreation
Congresscs.

The 1907 Chicago Congress, the first National Recrea-
tion Congress ever held, marked the birth of the national
rccreation movcment. The 1959 Chicago Congress may
well mark the achievement of maturity by this movement.
The joint sponsorship of this Congress by the American
Recreation Society, as the professional fellowship organiza-
tion, and the National Recreation Association, as the serv-

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
  
   
  
  

icc organization through which professional and lay-citizen
participation unite to provide many nationwide services
in the recreation field, and the joint desire of these two or-
ganizations to wclcome all other intcrested groups to par-
ticipation in the finest possible National Recreation Con-
gresses, at the lowest possible cost to participants, is on
indication of that maturity. It is my hope, and, I am sure,
the hope of all of us, this same close working relationship
between the two organizations will soon be extended to alI
other aspects of the national recreation movement.

Another indication of the maturity may be found in th

the national level, such as the following major enterprises

Editorial

Recreation is many things to many peOple. All agree that it should be pleasurable.

The term “recreation” is subject to a great variety of interpretations.
This fact leads to many problems in the acquisition, planning, devel-
opment, and administration of recreation areas, for people of various

interests visualize difTerent possibilities in identical areas. For example,
hunters or fishermen, as contrasted with those who wish only to observe
and study wildlife, are rarely in agreement on the recreation values of ,
an area. The desires of skiers and nonskiers are often incompatible; and

those who desire ready access to remote regions-—and convenient ac-
_ eonnnodations when they get there—have distinctly dilierent points

of view from wilderness enthusiasts.

Such dilierences of opinion, resulting from lack of unifomlity in
general objectives, as well as from an incomplete understanding of
the overall picture, are further complicated by the fact that the recrea-

C; Frank BrOCI‘mm‘ tion possibilities of many lands are in direct competition with such

activities as logging, mining. grazing, production of hydroelectric
power or water supply, and the development of building sites. . . .
. . . recreation is many things. It involves any activity participated in,
any time and anywhere, merely for the enjoyment it alTords. Recrea-
tion may be purely physical; it may provide intellectual, esthetic, or
emotional outlets; or combinations of these. In its broadest sense, it
encompasses much more than mere physical activity. Second, the way
spare time is used is very definitely individual in nature. Any activity
that serves as recreation for one person may be work—or a bore—for
another.

Further, recreation needs vary at dilierent times with specific in-
dividuals. They not only change during periods of one’s life, in
accordance with physical ability and intellectual capacity, but often
with dilierent periods in one day, depending upon personal moods.
The rewards of recreational activities, whatever their nature, depend
upon the degree to which they provide outlets for personal interests:
physical development, mental improvement, cultural growth, or social
adjustment, not attainable in one’s daily routine. Third, while proper
use of spare time may be beneficial, improper spareotime activities can
be affecting a lifetime. . . .

In our definition of recreation, the word “pleasurable” recognizes
that recreation is fun. Maximum release from routine accrues to the
individual only if he voluntarily selects sonic spare-time activity be-
cause of the pleasure it ochrs. But recreation should do more. . . . Con-
structive activities can enrich. broaden, and devel0p individual capa-
bilities and gratify man’s natural desire for new and more satisfying
ways of life. lndced, more than a few individuals credit their interest
in a particular vocation to an idea planted during their early years by

inspired direction in some sort of recreation program. #

TENNIS COURT

 

Cushioned for
Comfort and Safety

Now the famous Saf-l’la, used for
I'ubberizing playgrounds, has also been
successfully adapted for surfacing
tennis courts. Recreation Directors and
School Executives who know about the
safety, convenience and weather resist-
ance of Saf-Plo will be interested in
knowing that the tennis courts have
all these advantages and more. The
life of the court will be increased be-
cause Saf-Pla can be applied over any
existing hard surface . .

Tennis players will appreciate the
surer fooling of rubber on rubber, as
well as the attendant foot-eose
brOught abovt by this resilient surface.
The uniform bounce plus the safely
factor in the event of a fall are addi-
tional reasons why your tennis court
should be surfaced with Sof-Pla.

Our Pakistan Counterparts
Sirs:

I recently went through a copy of
your line and informative journal and
was really thrilled to find the progress
that happy and richly cultured America
has made, even in so many specialized
branches of recreation. As a brother
recreation worker, and the only profes-
sional employee of the Pakistan Na-
tional Recreation Association, I con-
gratulate you all for this wonderful
progress in spreading the message of
joy through RECREATION.

Pakistan is marching towards a rapid
industrialization. The life in the rural
areas is quite colorful, pleasant, and
richly cultured. But the growing town-
ships are congested and unhealthy, es-
pecially in the industrial workers’ col-
onics, and these are consequently
gloomy. Leisure time is increasing but
the only popular source of passive rec-
reation is the commercial movie. Radio
is within the reach of middle-class peo-
ple only. Owing to the conventional
purdah system, women are segregated,
and social groups are purely masculine
and dull.

Active recreation activities are devel-
oping, in their very primary stages, in
quite a disorganized manner. The tra-
ditional and foreign sources of recrea-
tion are becoming popular; but a lot of
work has to be done to organize them.

NRA of Pakistan has a great task
ahead. . . . Authorities have recognized
the importance of recreation, in its bal-
anced and organized form, as the best
use of leisure time. In addition to sub-
stantial monetary grants, parks, arts,
crafts, theaters, and other recreational
institutions are being promoted and
patronized by the government and its
olIicials. Our National Council of So-

cial Welfare had recently organized a
training in “Group Work In Recrea-

tion,” with the help of Mrs. H. G. Stell,
a brilliant American lady, who was here

with her husband (U.S. Embassy).

We recently had a National Recrea-

tion Conference in Karachi, which was
largely attended. Many experts in vari-
ous fields of recreation and the munici-
pal commissioner of Karachi addressed
the conference. ‘

NRA of Pakistan has published sev-
eral booklets in local language, and is
issuing a monthly News Bulletin cover-
ing news and features about recreation
in our country. It has also employed
a trained professional worker in its
headquarters to assist the secretary in
his work (fortunately myself).

Interesting news, publications, maga-
zines, ideas, advice, and suggestions
from fellow recreation workers in Amcr-
ica are most welcome and will be very
benefiting.

ant, National Recreation Association

Preconception
Sirs:

\Vatcrford Township, Michigan, par-
ticipated this summer in the Interna-
tional Exchange Program in Recrea-
tion. Our visitor, from Asia, came for
one week. He was educated, informed,
and very interesting. His visit provided
a very worthwhile experience for our
community and brought to public focus
the importance of recreation.

Our visitor revealed an interesting
preconception of the U.S.A. . . . Before
coming to America he believed we were
all alcoholics, that people would be
drunk in the streets. He said this im-
pression was made during the war by
US. military personnel stationed in his
country. Upon visiting the US. and
living in our cities, he discovered he
was wrong.

Do not underestimate the importance
of the International Exchange Program
in Recreation!

"The child’s interests tend toward motor acts."

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES . . . whether as instructor, super-

that children’s interests are so strongly “toward motor acts”.

grounds are crowded with active youngsters. The Cosom
SAFE-T-PLAY idea grew out of your need to prevent
physical injury as you promote physical fitness.

New Spirit of Halloween
Sirs:

A tiny boy told Scrooge of the spirit
of Christmas and I should like to tell
of the new spirit of Halloween. I know
that many children all over the world
agree with me in feeling that [INICEF
Day is wonderful. I am a teen-ager
now, but l remember well the great kick
I, as a child, received from collecting
pennies for the children less fortunate
than I——particularly during those years
when dressing up had lost its thrill and
candy made my face break out. I was
not collecting . . . for a “foreign char-
ity“; even then I realized children are
children above all else and that it is not
right for them to go hungry.

There is no “pressure” on the young-
sters to collect for UNICEF. It is en-
tirely voluntary and does not take away
any of the fan of this holiday. When
our stomachs aehed from the candy,
nut‘ hearts felt good. Can't you see that
making October 31st I'VICEF Day has
given a new and greater meaning to the
spirit of Halloween?

Reflections Upon lie-reading
Sirs:

l have just taken the time to go back
to my June issue of RECREATION and re-
read and notice some of the more inter-
esting items, as far as I am concerned.

May I comment, and most favorably
so, on the article by Elvira Delany,
“Here Today—Gone Tomorrow?” As
a member of the National Parks Asso-
ciation and The Wilderness Society, as
well as the National Recreation Associ-
ation, I am pleased to see space given
this important current problem. With-
out these areas that are being swallowed
up, where can we promote recreation
activities and family unity and enjoy-
ment?

The article by Mr. Stocker may be
of interest to some of your readers, but
I can't help but feel. that for many, not
too strong a point of the joys and bene-
fits of camping may have been given.
Further, I question the up-to-date fig-
ures given on costs. I realize the gen-
eral public does not read this magazine
but those who may pass on this inform-
ation can well give false impressions.
I find that in various areas of the coun-
try costs can vary considerably. Avail-
ability is a problem-whow to help mem-
bers find sources.

PLACES OF UNUSUAL INTEREST

The “Windy City,” as it is called, earned its niekname
because of the strong winds from Lake Miehigan. (Occa-
sionally, in winter, it was necessary to aid pedestrians by
stretching ropes across Michigan Boulevard which parallels
the lake.) So, hold on to your hat, and let’s go-—-

Generally, the lakeside areas are the most intcresting,
although therc are many fine parks to the west. If you want
a trip by water, sightseeing motor yaehts start from thc
Miehigan Avenue Bridge near the Tribune Tower.

The recreation needs and interests of the city are served
by the Chicago Park District, the Board of Education, and
the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. The Local
Arrangements Committce of the Congress (inquire at the
Congress Information Desk) will be only too happy to tell
you what to see in addition to the things that will be eovcred
hy the oIIicial Congress Tour (sec “Tours,” page 318). The
intellectual interests of Chicago are served, in great part,
by a number of universities, among them the University of
Chicago, University of Illinois, Northwestern, and Loyola.

See the Things They Talk About
The Chicago Natural History Museum, often called the Field

Museum, lies in historic and beautiful Grant Park, near the
oflices of the Chieago Park District at 14th Boulevard. Par-
ticularly noteworthy are its relics and presentations of Amer-
iean Indian life. Its Hall of Man contains Malvina Hoff-
man’s famous sculptures of the raees of mankind.

A short distance away is the magnifieent John G. Shedd
Aquarium. From here it is only a short way, on foot or by
bus, out onto a peninsula in the lake, to the jewel-like Adler
Planetarium. The view of the lake and lakeside parks, and
the eity, is espeeially spectacular from this point.

The Art Institute lies in Grant Park, on Michigan Boule-
vard, and contains one of the world’s great art colleetions.

314

Of unusual charm are Mrs. Thorne’s Miniature Rooms in
the institute. Adjoining it, to the northeast, is the beautifful
Kenneth Sawyer Goodman Memorial Theatre and, on its
southside, Lorado Taft’s Fountain of the Great Lakes.

In the heart of Grant Park lies the Buckingham Memorial
Fountain, one of the greatest in the world, whieh features
night displays with eolored lights. Usually lighted until
September 30th, this is a memorable sight, and you may
still have time to see it if you do not delay.

The “Top of the Rock” is the name of the observation tower
on the 45th floor of the Prudential Building where you go to
“see Chicago from the sky.” It is on the north side of Grant
Park, at Randolph Street, and open day and night. There
are other places for views, also, such as the tops of the Board
of Trade at LaSalle Street and Jackson Boulevard, the Tri-
bune Tower, 435 North Michigan Avenue, and so on. The
Tribune has stones from many famous buildings in its walls.
Near it is the striking new Sun-Times Building and Plaza
where, from the Street, one can see newspapers come off the
press.

The Gold Coast, Other Parks

Where Michigan Boulevard meets the lake at Lake Shore
Drive is Chicago’s Gold Coast so called because of its wealth
with famous promenades, shore parks, and beaehes. Of
course, almost the entire lake front of the eity is a series of
magnifieent parks.

Lincoln Park—An unusual chess-and-eheeker pavilion by
the lake shore was a gift of Laurens Hammond to the eity.

Among the many fine memorial statues in Lincoln Park
are those of Hans Christian Andersen, Eugene Field, and
the famous Lincoln by Daniel Chester French (seulptured
in studios located on what are now the premises of National
Recreation Association headquarters in New York). In

other iargc industries, and one of the busiest of the Great
Lakes ports. I t has been the site of two great world's fairs,
many a hot poiiticai convention, and now, is host to its
third nationai recreation congress. The first, a history-
making event, took piace here in 1907 under the auspiees
of the Piayground Association of A meriea—iater to become
the National Recreation Association as we know it today.

Lindsay, speaking on the “It’eiation of Play to Juveniie De-
iinquency”; Jane Addams of Na” House, on “i’ubiic Ree-
reation and Soeiai Moraiity"; Joseph Lee, vice-president
of the Massachusetts Civic League, on "May as Training in
Citizenship”; Dr. Luther ii. Cuiick, president of the Hay-
ground Association, on “May and Democracy"; and others.
In 1935, the seeond national recreation congress heid in
Chieago was again sponsored soieiy by the Association-—

Soldier Fieid Stadium, in Burnham Park on the lakefront,
seats 110,000. Many special events take place under its
floodlights, including major sport and music events, pageants.

Lincoln Park, too, there is the zoo lithe Brookiield Zoo is in
the western suburbs) and the Chicago Historical Society,
which harbors the famous Lincoln dioramas.

North of the city in suburban W'ilmette, is the striking
Bahai Temple, on the lake, and nearby, the yacht harbor
and shore facilities of the W'ilmette Park System.

Iackson I’arhreOne of the finest parks in the city, Jackson
Park starts at 56th Street, right on the lake, in the Hyde
Park sector. It was converted into a park for the 1893
\V or1d's iolumbian Exposition under the direction of Fred-
erick Law Olmsted. It may be reached by bus, subway, or
suburban trains on the Illinois Central (you get these on
Michigan Avenue at Randolph or Van Buren and at Roose-
velt Road) . Near the northern end of the park is the Museum
of Science and Industry.

Churches and Temples

Although the Loop and nearby areas have almost no resi-
dents, there are a number of religious edifices there. Among
these, for services or for a tourist visit, are: St. Mary’s
Roman Catholic Church at 9th and Wabash (Chicago’s
oldest). Near the Morrison are St. Peter’s Roman Catholic
Church, the Chicago Loop Orthodox Synagogue, and the
Chicago Methodist Temple. You can’t miss the latter, as it
is said to be the world’s tallest church. In “Near North”
one finds the handsome Fourth Presbyterian Church, St.
James Protestant Episcopal Cathedral, and the Roman Cath-
olic Cathedral of the Holy Name. The impressive Temple

Sholom is on Lake Shore Drive.

Hull House—Some may wish to go “Near West” to Hull
House to see Jane Addams’ famous settlement. The centen-
nia1 of Miss Addams’ birth will be commemorated next year.
Miss Addams served on the National Recreation Board from
1908 to 1914, with such Chicagoans as Mrs. Emmons Blaine,
Charles R. Crane, Mr. and Mrs. John M. Glenn, Cyrus Mc-
Cormick, J r., Harold McCormick, Mary McDowell, Harold
H. Swift, Clement Studebaker, Jr., and Graham R. Taylor.

Shopping
There are a number of fine shops in or near the Loop,
especially along Michigan Avenue. Marshall Fields and

Carson, Pirie, Scott are especially renowned department
stores. Also outstanding are: The Old County Store (gro-
ceries, candies, and so on), Peacock’s (jewelry), Blum’s
(gowns), The Merchandise Mart, Kimball’s (music), and
Finchley (men’s wear) . North of the Loop, along Michigan
and nearby streets, are innumerable shops, large and small.

Dining 111 Clncago

There are a great many restaurants in the Loop area, near
the Morrison 1' for Morrison Hotel restaurants, see page

317) as well as in the “Near Northside” area, but the follow-
ing selection has been made by someone who knows them
first hand. In the Loop are such moderate-price chains as
Harding, Toffenetti, BSG,and Stouffer. For those who want
something special, “different,” or who are more discriminat-
ing (try Shrimps de Jongh, probably Chicago’s most noted
dish; Bismarcks are a breakfast favorite), there are the fol-
lowing:

The Berghog—A favorite for those who like German cook-
ing. Moderate prices.

Biackhawk Restaurant—Many Chicagoans consider this the
best steak house in their city. Reasonable.

Ca [é de Paris—Night club serving excellent French food and
wines.

Cape Cod Room, Drake Hotel—Nautical atmosphere, deli-
cious sea food. Expensive.

Carson Pirie, Scott Department Store—Luncheons “for
men only.”

Diana Court—In the Michigan Square Building.

Don the Beachcomber—Polynesian and Cantonese food, out-
standing South Sea atmosphere.

Henrici’s—Not to be missed, this is probably the oldest
restaurant in Chicago, filled with old-time charm and mod-
erate in price.

Jacques French Restaurant—Outstanding in French food,
outdoor dining in summer. Expensive.

Le Petit Gourmet—F or atmosphere, on a beautiful court.

Pump Room, Ambassador East Hotel—Most plush restaur-
ant in Chicago, fancy food. Very expensive.

gram:

A part of the opening general session,
Monday morning at eleven, in addition to
the keynote address by Seeretary Arthur
Flemming of the U.S. Department of
Health, Edueation, and W’eliare, will be
devoted to a salute to our 49th and 50th
states—Alaska and Hawaii (see pages 327-9). Covemors’
representatives from all states will be asked to stand.

We hope this will be a “singing” Congress. The Chicago
Park District and the W. W. Kimball Company are making
a portable Kimball organ and an organist available for the
entire week, and every general session will have prelimin-
ary organ musie. Speeial music programs are also planned.

Banquets

There will be two banquets this year. On Tuesday even-
ing, an ABS banquet will present awards to eolleagues in the
professional recreation field. The Congress Banquet and
Danee will be on Thursday evening and will be a big affair,
with a stimulating speaker and surprise entertainment.

Two big tours have been arranged for Friday afternoon:
one to Chieago recreation facilities, the other to the Wilson
Sporting Goods plant at River Grove. In addition, a series
of “specialized tours” will be seattered throughout the week,

Chieago swimming pools, the prodigious storage of eostumes

handled by the Chieago Park Distriet, and so on. These will
be arranged at the Congress Registration Desk, upon request

TIPS
FOR
CONGRESS

RECORDERS

If you are a recorder at a National
Recreation Congress session or at any
other conference, let the following tips
help you:

THE MOST diIIicult job the recorder

has to do is listen. Listening is
very hard work, especially to listen ob-
jectively and not selectiver, hearing
the things that one wants to hear. The
most common criticism about reeord-
ers’ reports is that they reveal more
about the reeorder’s opinions than what
went on in the discussion. The record-

 

\A IVVJ‘N

er’s first rule is: “Listen for all points
and a” points of view.”

The second job of a recorder is to
write a smnmary of what is said. This
means just that. A recorder has to
strike a balance, a summary of a sen-
tcnee or two, and a verbatim report.
He or she must continually ask himself
what these reports are to be used for.

Usually, reports are useful when they
report a few whole ideas, rather than
boiled down general summaries of gen-
eralizations. Getting at the kernel of
an idea is diIIieult. Report a conclusion,

CHICAGO WELCOMES YOU

particiu'arly where it is unusual or dif-
ferent. Often four or five ideas or con-
clusions make a report which people
like to hear. The second rule is: be se-
lective, make it short, but don’t boil it
down heyond recognition.

The third job of a recorder is to be
a helpful participant. He has a special
function to perform. He should aetiver
try to summarize what is going on; for
example, “As I have been listening, I
have felt we have reached some agree-
ment about this point . . .” or “Mr.
Smith has said . . ., does everyone agree
with this?” It is usually best if the re-
corder will restrict his participation
and not express his or her own opin-
ions. The third rule is help the discus-
sion by checking for agreement about
conclusions but restrain your own opin-
ions.—From A daft Leadership, May 11,
1959.

of delegates, if a large enough group is interested. Stop by
and signify your desire to go, register your request, and a
guide will be assigned. These trips will be at the delegate's
own expense.

General Sessions

Don’t forget the general sessions, with Secretary Flemming
speaking on Monday morning; Dr. Henry, president of the
University of Illinois, Monday evening; Mr. \Vadsworth,
of the President’s Advisory Committee on Fitness, Wednes-
day morning; and Paul Goodman, author and teacher, at
the Congress Banquet, Thursday.

The elosing general session, at eleven o’eloek Friday morn-
ing, will he an important one when a distinguished panel
presents the subject, “Is Recreation Doing Its Job?,” from
the viewpoint of parent, educator, taxpayer. (Note article,

“These I Would Like . . .” by Karla V. Parker, president of

the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, page 320.)

THESE, I WOULD LIKE . . .

Speaking informally, as a mother, a citizen, and vol-
unteer, the president of the National Congress of Par-
ents and Teachers tells leaders what she would like
a local recreation department to offer her children.

Karla V. Parker

FIMIERE IS A faint

note of person-
al inappropriateness
as I consider this
suhject suggested by
RECREATION: partly
because our own

 

children have reach-
ed the stage where they are wondering
what their recreation departments offer
their children; partly because, as pres-
ident of the National Congress of Par-
ents and Teachers, I have a sort of na-
tional concept of all the needs of all
children; and partly because as secre-
tary of a local recreation board, I know
flights of fancy must be tempered by
stern realities of money, space, and fa-
cilities—yes, even understanding and
the cooperative spirit. Having thus pre-
sented what might possibly be creden-
tials, I shall answer from heart and
mind the “what I would like” preposi-
tion posed by the editor of “The Maga-
zine of the Recreation Movement.”

It ought to go without saying, but I
do not think it can, that a recreation
deparment is not in a position to offer
a good program to children unless the
director with the staff, be it large or
small, is thoroughly imbued with the
basic realization that recreation is not
just play and busy work, but rather
that true recreation ministers to mind
and soul, to emotional deveIOpment, to

personal skills, as well as to health of
body. This is, I am sorry to say, not
always true. In our search for time-
occupation for youngsters we do not
always find trained and sensitive per-
sonnel to realize this, and a recreation
department may only emphasize com-
petitive sports and physical fitness or
have scarcely more than a recognition
of the need for protection and safety
in a highly mechanized world. I would
want my children’s recreation planned

comes out of forethought and planning.
Sometimes it comes out of hard work,
like the play area I remember, which
was originally a city dump until the
neighbors .reclaimcd it by some dick-
ering with the authorities and much la-

bor.

It practically goes without saying——
but I shall say it—that I would want
a program of great variety: from small
children sitting under a tree shaded
from the post-noontimc heat and listen-

 

Program. should offer great variety—from. storytelling . . .

by peeple of training and vision, even
professional training and broad vision.
Having thus permitted myself the lux-
ury of a bit of philosophizing I shall
try now to enter into some of the spe’
cifics of my hopes.

Land! Land! must come first, space
for out-of-door activities in both the
warmer and cooler months, a plot of
ground on which buildings can be
placed for activities indoors—all of
these near enough so children need not
travel a deterring distance. This neces-
sity is not provided automatically; it

ing to stories, to ceramic classes in the
school art room or the public gallery,
or some talented local citizens’ base-
ment; from scrabbling on jungle gyms
to playing on junior baseball teams, so
organized that every youngster in the
area gets his chance and nobody, par-
ents included ( or shall I say especial-
ly?), try to make a professional player
out of him when he’s just having some
sandlot fun. I would want one that al-
lows for the fact that personal skills,
such as Ping-pong, baseball, archery

and swimming, last many, many years

RECREATION

 

 

. . . to ceramic classes.

and provide outlets for the tensions and
stresses that belabor modern living as
well as physical exercise in a world of
desk and armchair inaction.

I would want a recreation department
to remember there are girls as well as
boys, that certain activities foster qual-
ities of femininity and womanhood, and
that this portion of our immature cit-
izenry has a vital and influential part
to play in the character of the nation
we develop and kind of future we shall
have. Perhaps this form of planning
will take creative thinking and read-
justnients in a program. It may mean
some interagency planning which will
greatly enlarge the influence and effec-
tiveness of each or all. Incidentally,
this is not meant to imply that girls
are not to participate in physical ac-
tivities. I am almost at the point of
believing no boy or girl ought to re-
ceive a high school diploma or leave
school unless swimming is part of his
standard equipment.

Then I would want a department
which would take into consideration
that children come from families; that
any agency receiving public funds
ought to consider a part of its respon-
sibilities the strengthening of family
life. We are coming to the realization
that many of our social problems have
their roots in the inability of families
to maintain a happy cohesiveness. Here,
a recreation department can offer much.
. . . It may be family picnics, or mother-
or father-children lessons in swimming
with a final achievement event, family
hobhy nights, or scheduled visits to

OCTOBER 1959

 

places of local interest. Any alert di- *

rector and staff can add to these. I
heard of one city which assumed re.
sponsibility for family language classes.
Let us not dehate here the fine line he-
twecn recreation and education. This
one was “for fun,” and it was fun.

By implication, I have indicated a
year-round program with vacation days
not the end-all of recreation. After-
school activities in crafts and games,
utilization of personal and group skills
and team work and team play can be-
come an integral part of living experi-
cnce for boys and girls. The winter
joys, where youngsters are fortunate
enough to experience them, can add a
verve to life that can be long lasting:
sliding downhill on sites reserved for
the purpose or in areas by location so
fitted, skiing, tobogganing, and ice
sculpturing.

WHAT I have said thus far has re-
ferred to children, probably
twelve and under, but much of the ap-
proach described here would apply to
teen-agers, young adults, and not-so-
young adults. A program of variety—
of year-round, day and evening service
—should be the aim of every recreation
department.

There are other almost essential fac-
tors I would desire in order to make
a full, rich recreation experience. A de-
partment cannot do it alone. It needs

the supporting interest and understand-
ing of citizens. I would think a well-

organized board of some type would
add strength not only to help set policy

If you have ever seen the light of
understanding shine in another’s
eyes where no light shone hefore, if
you have ever guided the unsteady

but help interpret philosophy and pol-
icy to the public at large, or, even at
times, to seek cooperation of govern-
ment hodies and volunteer groups. I
would want it representative of various
interests in the communities so there
would be confidence in it as having an
unbiased approach. If an official board
does not seem to fit into the local pat-
tern, a department at least ought to
find an advisory committee from some
source to aid in general planning.

I would want—and I am still think-
ing of children—interagency and in-
terorganization cooperation so all fa-
cilities and opportunities might be
used: schools, libraries, art, music,
drama, and dancing resources; parks,
playgrounds, cmpty lots; the support of
business, lahor, conservation and agri-
cultural personnel; youth agencies and
churches. Others could be named, but
these indicate a fair sampling.

FOR children, but obviously not for

children alone, I yearn for close
contact with every channel which can
be utilized for explanation, interpreta-
tion, promotion, and the building up of
such undergirding of a recreation pro-
gram that it can develop unhampcred
by narrow concepts, preconceived ideas,
or lack of funds. This obviously means
the newspapers, both weekly and daily,
the district advertising sheets, radio,
television, house organs, and all kinds
of organization bulletins.

Most of all, I would like the recrea-
tion department to plan a children’s
progam for children and not for pub-
lic display; a program to fit their needs
in a world day by day growing more
complicated, huilt on knowledge that it
is increasingly difficult for each one of
us, children and adults alike, to find
himself, his skills, his capacity for
individual expression. This can be one
of the great contributions which a vig-
orous, sensitive, creative recreation de-
partment can hring to its young and
growing patrons. What greater public
relations agent could there be than a
happy, satisfied customer! 1";

Explaining the role of
councils of social agencies
in community recreation planning.

HEN YOUNG Joey Joncs dashes
W in from school, gulps a glass
of milk, grabs his catcher’s
mitt and dashes out to join the kids at
the playground, he doesn’t care two
whoops whether the playground is run
by the city, the board of education, or
a settlement house. All he knows or
cares is that it’s his playground and it’s
fun.

Joey’s mother knows a bit more
about that playground. As a represent-
ative of her PTA, she served on a
committee of the Community Welfare
Council, which, at the request of the
Mayor’s Citizens Committee, had made
a big survey of the city’s recreation

nccds, and had come up with recom-
mcndations to the City Fathers, one of
which was that this very playground
be opened. Mrs. J oncs was ccrtainly no
expert on recreation, but the commit-
tee did have expcrt help—from the Na-
tional Recreation Association, a nearby
university, the park departmcnt, and
other organizations—and Mrs. Jones
had listened and learned. Now and then
she had even chipped in with some
views of her own, as a homemaker,
mother, PTA member, and voter. The
experts gave her respectful attention.

Joey’s father knew something about
recreation, too. He contributed his
fair share to the CommUnity Chest cam-
paigns every year, and he noticed that
the Chest put great stress on youth serv-
ices, particularly recreation. And, as a

taxpayer, he had voted yes on the tax
levy that had brought Joey’s play-
ground into being.

To be sure, Mr. Jones had not actu-
ally read the statement by President
Eisenhower’s Advisory Committee on
The Fitness of American Youth, but if
he had, he would have heartily okayed
its sentiments:

“What I want for my children I want
for all other children and youth in
America—a decent home in a decently
arranged and stable neighborhood——
the protection of soundly conceived and
well-administered community services,
including those activities designed to
promote health, physical growth, and
development, and the acquisition of
modest skill in the constructive arts of

leisurc. . . .”

Mr. Jones was quietly proud of Mrs.
Jones for serving on that committee.
As he said, “It’s about time all these
agencies got together and decided what
the town needs, who’ll do what, and
who’ll pay the bills.”

Somctimes a health
council can be a perfect mecting ground

and welfare
where “all those agencies" can do just
that. A council can be this useful kind
of agent when it knows its business;
whcn it is truly reprcscntative of all
major community interests, including
public and private agencies, the schools,
churches, business, labor, and service
groups; and when it has thc skill and
wisdom to gather the facts about com-
munity needs and present them in a
way that kindles public interest into
public action.

“Cooperation Between Public and
Private Agencies” is a prctty stiff and
bulky phrase. “Cooperation between
people” is easier to say—and usually
easier to get. The stiffness limbcrs up
considerably when staff members of the
agencies concerned know each other as
peOple, not just as official representa-
tives. Two automobiles speeding along
the highway can’t c00perate in the
cause of good driving—but their driv-
ers can. In agency cooperation, the un-
derbrush that grows up around differ-
ences in function, structure, and spon-
sorship can suddenly reveal some clear
paths to action, when a few resolute peo-
ple glimpse through the thicket a recre-
ation goal they all want to reach.

Many councils have applied this kind

RECREATION

 

 

Listen, learn—mid speak up.

of skill to planning for recreation. Of-
ten a eommunitywide survey of com-
munity needs and resources is the first
step.

Back in 1950, the Community Coun-
cil of Houston, Texas, undertook such
a survey. With the assistance of parks
and recreation departments and of the
planning commission, a blueprint of
recreation needs was designed, accord-
ing to districts. A report, Recreation
for Everyone, outlined dramatically
the recreation services desired by pub-
lie and voluntary agencies in each dis-
trict. The report won widespread pub-
licity. It aroused citizens so thoroughly
that at the next election they voted a
substantial bond issue for new parks,
swimming pools, and recreation cen-
ters. The same three bodies kept on co-
operating. Now they have eomc up
with a new report, Recreation, [or Eve-
ryone, Revised 1957, which shows an
encouraging growth in services.

Sometimes just putting a couple of
heads together gets action, without a
formal survey. In York, Pennsylvania,
the school board had condemned an old
school building and was preparing to
offer it for sale as a business warehouse.
The city’s recreation director and the
council executive had other ideas: They
thought the old school would make a
fine recreation center i n a district where
one was much needed. A council eom-
niittcc was appointed and began talks
with civic and school oflicials. The re-
sult—the school board, in return for a
mmll section of parkland in another
area. gave the school to the city. The
board and the recreation commission,
with the help of state funds, shared in
the cost of transforming the old school

OCTOBER 1959

into a recreation ecntcr. The council
got some of the voluntary agencies in-
terestcd in providing furniture and
equipment. The recreation commis-
sion, which had been struggling along
in an inaccessible third-floor suite in a
crowded ollice building, found a new
home in the old school. The first floor
was made into meeting rooms for sen-
ior citizens and tecn-agers. The base-
ment became an arts-and-crafts shop
and a rumpus room for children. Eve-

rybody was delighted.

Increasingly, however, not only cit-
ics, but countiesuparticularly those re-
eeiving overflow from major cities—
are concerned that the Johnnies may
not have play space, or families, sites
for their picnics and other outdoor rec-
reation, as usable land rapidly disap-
pears. As a result, a number of com-
munities in very recent years have called
upon the welfare councils, and the coun-
cils have requested the National Recre-
ation Association, to come in and make
studies and long-range plans that will
insure the local provision of play-
grounds and all other types of recre-
ation services and facilities. Prominent
among these have been studies of Phoe-
nix and Maricopa County, Arizona;
Muskegon County, Michigan; and To]-
edo, Ohio; all made at the request of
local councils.

In the latter city, such an overall
evaluation: made a number of years ago,
has been restudied and a long-range
provision made to meet new and impor-
tant needs that have since developed.

Social agencies these days worry
about problems of the aged, too. Cer-
tainly recreation ln-lps ease some of
their problems.

As more and more golden age clubs
were started in Dayton, Ohio, by
churches and private agencies, the di-
rector of the public recreation depart-
ment asked the group work and recrea-
tion division of the Community Wel-
fare Council to call together represent-
atives from these clubs to swap experi-
ence and promote new clubs in the city's
community centers. These golden agcrs
became a citywide committee of rec-
reation for the older people, its mem-
bership evenly divided among public
recreation department centers, private
agencies, and church clubs. The pub-

lic recreation department provides fa-
cilities for most of the program and all
the staff leadership for big citywide
events, enjoyed several times a year by
seniors from all the groups.

In many cities public housing and ur-
ban renewal developments have offered
a big challenge to welfare and recrea-
tion agencies. The planning for serv-
ices committee of the Chicago Welfare
Council has worked closely and cor-
dially with the housing authority for
several years. Among its accomplish-
ments has been a “Statement of l’osi-
tion,” spelling out the role of leisure
time to agencies within a public hous-
ing project. This has become a practi-
cal working guide for the council’s
division on recreation and informal
education. “One thing we are sure of,”
says the associate executive of the divi-
sion, “recreation is not enough. Pub-
lie housing project residents frequently

consist of low income families, broken
family units, families without aspira-
tion. Such residents use the leisure-
time service agencies not only for rec-
rcation but for many kinds of problem

solving.”

Considering the myriad of threads
that go into the complicated pattern of
recreation services today, perhaps it’s
just as well that young Joey Jones
doesn’t know too nmch about the play-
ground he loves. So let him have his
fun, with no complicated worries about
surveys, interrelationships, or the phil-
osophy of modern recreation. Let him
accept the playground for what it is:
one gift among many, from a commu-
nity that wants the best for its young
people. Some day J ocy will know more.
lle may even grow up to he the execu-
tive of a welfare council-—or a director

of a public recreation department. #-

tion activities are carried on by vol-

the national recreation centers—where
many training activities for leaders are
carried on—is enormous. Operated by
the Central Council for Physical Rec-
reation,‘ one of the outstanding agen-
cies in the recreation field, the centers
offer daily, wcckend, and extended
courses for men and womcn leaders
and expert coaching for young people
in a wide variety of rccreation pursuits.
The Central Council was formed in
1935 “to promotc the physical and men-
tal health of the community through all
forms of physical activity.” It became
involved almost immediately in the de-
velopment of volunteer leadership
through a scries of courses and “coach-
ing holidays” to staff the growing de-
mands of an expanding program.
In the beginning, the Council used
borrowed schools, colleges, and univcr-
sities for training courses but lack of

facilities for some activities and con-
flicts in schedules made this arrange-
ment unsatisfactory and the need for a
home of their own became apparent.
However, no funds for such a project
were available and the center was little
more than an idea until the Vansittart-
Neal family donated Bisham Abbey as
the first national recreation center.
Bisham Abbey is a lovely old manor
house located on the Thames, in the
countryside not far from London. With
minor alterations, it was quickly adapt-
ed to accommodate track and field,
archery, rugby, soccer, hockey, tennis,
and basketball. In addition, the river
afforded opportunities for canoeing and
sailing. The new center was enthusias-
tically received and in a few short
months it was successfully established.
It was soon obvious that one center
could not supply the demand, and
means of obtaining similar facilities in
another location were sought. Fortu-
nately, a gift of £120,000 from South
Africa made the purchase and equip-
ping of Lilleshall Hall possible. Lo-
cated in ShrOpshire, the second na-
tional recreation center afforded, in ad-
dition to a delightful formal garden, a
ten-acre, multiple-purpose playing field,
and special areas for tennis, basketball,
and netball. The King George VI Foun-
dation made a further grant, to permit

construction of a covered track-and-
lield training area, a large gymnasium,
and an all-weather playing area of three
acres. With the establishment of the
second center, much progress was ap-
parent but the plan was still incomplete.
There was need for an outdoor activity
center.

The King George VI Foundation pro-
vided another grant to purchase Plas-
y-Brenin—The King’s House—in the
Snowdonia area of North Wales. Here
courses were possible in mountain and
hill walking, rock climbing, mobile
camping, map and compass work, and
all the allied activities of the great out-
of-doors.

Coaching Holidays

As each new center came into use
the Central Council and the governing
hodies of various sports and activities
filled them with courses for coaches and
leaders, designed to improve their ef-
fectivcness. Instruction is offered in a
variety of team sports, including rugby,
basketball and soccer, and also in ten-
nis, fencing. ballroom dancing. judo,
canoeing, sailing, track and field, bad-
minton. table tennis, weight lifting,
archery, national dancing, and gymnas-
tics. “Coaching Ilolidays” are also of-

try their hand at a new activity, even
though these participants may not be
acting as leaders.

In the year ending 31 March 1958,
1‘24- courses were conducted at the three
centers. Many of these courses were
for extended periods ranging up to
twenty-one days. others lasted for a sin-
gle day or a weekend. Preparation for
roaches included a prescrihed course of
instruction, with examination and certi-
fication as to competence.

In all, more than fifty thousand peo-
ple—approximately twenty-eight per-
cent of them women and girls—vattend-
ed the courses and holidays at their own
expense. Most of them returned to lead-
ership assignments in local recreation
groups with new knowledge, new skill,
new enthusiasm and renewed zeal for
the volunteer leadership they are pro-
viding in numerous recreation groups
throughout the nation. It is dillicult to
assess the value of the national recrea-
tion centers to Britain, but it is certain
programs carried on in these centers
have stimulated the formation of nu-
merous recreation groups and helped
attract and train the volunteers who
lead them. Similar centers in the linited
States might provide stimulation and
training for the personnel needed to
meet our growing, urgent need for com-
petent recreational leadership. D——>

While recreation leaders in Japan
have problems, participation isn’t one
of them. The Japanese peeple come
closer to perpetual motion during their
leisure time than any other people I
have observed in my travels.

In the area of sports, baseball is thc
national passion. Every man and boy
seems to consider a ball glove as essential as clothes in be-
ing prepared to venture forth from home. Young men play
games at six A.M., before going to school or work. During
the lunch hour the parks, streets, alleys, sidewalks, and roof-

tops are filled with males of all ages tossing balls in every
direction.

 

The first peek at these players in action would indicate
that pedestrians would be wise to wear catchers’ helmets.
It is not unusual to see cooks and waiters, in uniform, play-
ing catch in mid-morning or mid-afternoon work breaks,
outside hotels and restaurants. Even theatrical performers
may be seen tossing balls outside stage doors between shows.

011 holidays, teams line up at dawn to take their turns
in playing games on puhlic parks in a manner reminiscent
of public links golf players in some crowded areas of the
United States.

Baseball interest isn't limited to a single season either.
The Reverend Don Scars, who directs a mission to military
personnel for the National Council of Churches, tells of the
surprise of a group of young servicemen last Christmas Eve.
Returning from carol sings at hospitals and orphanages,
they found four young men throwing a baseball under a
strcet light in Yokahama at ten o’clock at night. Winthrop
Long, YMCA executive in Japan, tells of seeing hoys play
baseball in the snow on Hokkaido.

With this urge to participate, it is easy to understand
that play space and facilities are major concerns. However,
the millions of people living on mountainous islands have
learned to get the most possible mileage out of space avail-
able to them.

I was amazed to see boys playing baseball in a forest
where trees stood three to four feet apart and batted balls

ricocheted in every direction. Near Kyoto, boys were play-
ing a game on a river bank, with the infielders on dry land
and the outfielders taking up positions in the shallow water.
A rubber ball that floated made the amphibious game pos—
sible. What’s a little water?

0n Easter Sunday, boys were practicing their fielding
between services, at the Kobe Union Church, by throwing
rubber-covered balls against a sidewall and fielding the re-
bounds like youngsters here at home.

In some parks, games are played back to hack, with out-
fielders standing side by side, facing diamonds in opposite
directions. It is remarkable that they manage to play with-
out bumpers and radar and still avoid collisions and a high
rate of injuries.

If there isn’t space enough for a baseball game, the peo-
ple play badminton; if there isn’t Space for badminton, they
play table tennis; and if there is no room for table tennis,
they go fishing. Every pond seems to be completely sur-
rounded by fishermen.

Table tennis is very popular, and indoor Ping-pong par-
lors provide many tables for rent at nominal fees. Skating
rinks are jammed, and friends reported that skiing claims
more devotees in Japan than in any
other nation. It also claims more cas-
ualties, as Japanese skiers take the
kamikaze approach to the sport and sct
sail with wreckless abandon.

Participation in active recreation ex-
tends to swimming, tennis, hicycling,
distance running, and mountain climb-
ing, hut golf is priced out of the reach
of most people there. It is even expen-
sive for families in the upper income

 

brackets. One unusual aspect to golf
in Japan is that all caddies are girls and wear metal helmets
for protection from wild swingers. A club manager con-
fided that running a golf coursc there was comparable to
serving as dean of women at a college in the United States,
plus the normal duties of supervising a golf club.

With all of their bounce and drive, the Japanese are
equally interested in the artistic phases of recreation. If
baseball is a passion, flower decoration is a way of life.
Classes are available to everyone who wants to learn, and
most people do. As a result, there are artistic displays of
flowers in every room and corridor of homes, hotels, and
places of business, and in most cabs, buses, and train cars.

Painting also is a major avocation and, perhaps, most
surprising to me, was the musical talent and interest of the
Japanese. There are literally thousands and thousands of
well-trained musicians who can and do sing and play West-
ern and Eastern music with equal skill. Every school has
its hand, and orchestra, and choral groups. And there are
numerous drum-and-fife and drum-and-hugle corps, and at
least one glockenspiel-and-drum corps—a children’s group
that performed with distinction in the cherry blossom pa-
rade at Kyoto. :,‘.,.*"

E WELCOME Alaska and Hawaii as our 49th and
50th states—two lands with cmnpletely different

elimate and terrain, eaeh beautiful in its own way.

In Alaska, only a few eonnnunities have organized ree-
reation as yet. However, reereation flourishes at some Masu
kan air foree bases, and Fairbanks enjoys an excellent com.
munity reereation program, eondueted by the loeal YMCA.
In 1953, when the Vational Park Sen ice eommissioned the
National Recreation Assoeiation to do a community recre-
ation survey in that northern land, publie reereation lead.
ership was generally lacking. True enough, there were poo
tcntial leaders but they needed to be trained and mobilized
to action. Public. recreation agencies administering rec-
reation as a separate function. with part-time program and
leadership, were reported in Fairbanks, Ketchikan, J uneau.
and Anchorage. Other communities with some recreation
under other auspices were Kodiak. 7\iome. and Palmer.
However, interest in recreation activities was, and is, there
—as shown in some. of the pietures on these pages. Already.

MODERN PROGRAM FOR
MODERN YOUTH

W. A. Taylor

3. NEW PROGRAM just completing its first year of op-

eration in the three communities of Wildwood, New

Jersey, offers an interesting example of the working
together of industries, civie clubs, and puhlic recreation,
to satisfy some of the unmet needs of local teen-agers. Its
directors, Charles Juliano, of Wildwood, Albert Craven, of
North \Vildwood, and John Gourley, of Wildwood Crest,
feel that recreation centers have not always attracted the
youngsters interested in activitics other than Sports, espe-
eially those related to such technical subjects as clectronics,
aviation, space, chemistry, automobile mechanics, automa-
tion, and various other branches of science. In the begin-
ning, they accepted the following brcakdown of teen-age
interests as a working base:

1. Twenty-hve pereent interested in sports, social recre-
ation, and the usual recreation program.

2. Twcnty-five percent interested in hobbies, science, ex-
perimentation, construction, shop, electronics, visits to in-
dustries, museums, science clubs, and other activities that
might be helpful in choosing a future profession.

3. Fifty perccnt undecided, but if facilities and leader-
ship in Group Two were available, they would have a better
idea of what they might want to do.

Over a four-year period, the Aviation Education Com-
mittee of the Cape May County Civil Air Patrol Squadron
has developed a program of promoting aviation in the
schools, that slowly broadened into wide promotion of all
types of education since aviation requires trained personnel
from every field. An cffort was made in the beginning of
this program to get the best availahle material, mostly on
aircraft and flying, for the cadets. This resulted in an ac-
cumulation of material and sources of material that varied
from Space to landscaping, which the program was allowed
to utilize.

Discussions with industrialists and technical pe0ple in
the county revealed that a great many magazines, technical
journals, reports, and informative advertising—much of it
containing information not found in textbooks—were avail-
able for the program. Also, local industries and labora-
tories were able to supply other useful materials. The edu-
eation committee of the Wildwood Kiwanis Cluh proposed
setting up magazine racks in the recreation halls for storage
and display of all free technical publications, which are col-

sey, deveiopers and producers of piastics, is one of the insti-
gators and avid supporters of this new service to teen-agers.

lected and distributed by Kiwanis members, representing
almost every industry in the county. (Kiwanis is known
for its Kids Program.)

Lack of space in Wildwood and Wildwood Crest meant
starting out with just a tahle for magazines, but, ultimately,
space was found for magazine racks, supplied by Kiwanis,
and wall space was made available for wall charts and other
informative material. Recreation director Juliano, of Wild-
wood, contributed many of the successful ideas used in the
program.

In North Wildwood, too, the program started with just
a tablc, holding free technical and trade magazines sup-
plied by the industries of Cape May County. Thc firm sup-
port of Mr. Craven resulted in its rapid expansion. En-
thusiasm has grown so rapidly that now a whole room has
been set aside as an informal library. The literature is free
to youth and adults and is replenished monthly. The walls
are devoted to descriptive charts on science, chemistry,
electronics, aviation, and related subjects, including a three-
foot-by-five-foot colored wall chart of a cut-away jet engine.
(This was a big hit when it appeared in a school play.)

As a member (five-dollar fee) of the National Aviation
Education Council Library Service, the department receives
aviation materials on a monthly basis. Most important of
all, it receives information on sources of low-cost and free
materials, including visual aids suitable for a program of
this type. These are available to youngstcrs for school pro-
jects. They do not have to be returned as they are replaced
with newer editions. They also write in for these charts as
pin-ups for their own rooms and for use in school activities.

COLLECTING such materials is the first problem to be
solved, after industries in the area have been ap-
proached and have agreed to save them. Various methods
might be used, including using department of education or
highway department trucks; or sueh groups as the police,
civil defense, or fire departments; recreation department,
Explorer Scouts, and civic clubs. A county library service
is also a possibility.

The second step, after such material has been distributed,
is finding volunteer leaders who are specialists in technical
fields. Many fathers in every community are engineers,
technicians, scientists, and machinists. Many have con-
sidered volunteer leadership in recreation, but are under
the impression that it requires sports skills and are thus

not interested. They are glad to work, however, with young-
sters in projects involving radios, aviation, automobiles,
photography, and the like. Some may not be interested in
leadership, hut would be glad to huild working models for
use in the recreation center or the schools. Industries, too,
often have working models of their projects, and displays
they use at various trade shows, such as the Automation
Show in New York and the Tool Show in Philadelphia.

A Science and Aviation Club, set up to serve the needs of
the youth, has been started by Harry Caughan. Strictly
informal, the club has no dues, no membership cards, no
set meeting dates. Youngsters interested in the same sub-
jcct are brought together by referring them to each other
and supplying materials they request, on a pass-along basis.
These interests attract youths to the recreation centers and
draw them into its social and sport activities in which they
would not normally participate. These technical recreation
facilities are also available to Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Ex-
plorer Scouts, and other clubs using the recreation hall.

Technical films are shown at least one night per week,
and special films are ordered and shown on request.

This program is designed to supplement the present ed-
ucational system without creating another problem for the
schools. It helps by stirnulating students’ intellectual curi-
osity so they will study their texthooks for hasic knowl-
edge, not passing grades.

Building a Technical Recreation Program

The following steps are suggested for any department
seeking to expand its youth program.

Obtain the tools and a place to work.
Plan #1: Tools
This is the first step and can he the start of the whole pro-

.gram, depending on the ambitions of the recreation depart-
, ment and the funds available.

OCTOBER 1959

it

a. A room or a corner of a room.

b. Technical, trade, and hobhy magazines, ohtained from
the communities’ industries and individuals.

c. A table or rack for display and storage of free maga-
zines and other materials. Wall space or display boards
for charts, pictures, and educational illustrations.

Plan #2: With Outside Help.

Using a, b, and c of Plan #1, with the addition of a full-
or part-time volunteer or employee to coordinate the pro-
gram.

This director’s duty would be to obtain and make readily
available all magazines and other materials. Most of it
would be passed along quickly to prevent a backlog of old
magazines. The basic idea of this program being to keep
a continuous supply of new materials flowing to the partici-
pants. None of the material should he considered over
auybody’s head.

Plan #3: Shops and Work Areas

Set up sh0ps or work areas so that youngsters interested
in hot rods, sail wagons, aviation, models, electronics, chem-
istry, science, photography, and so on will be ahle to gain
practical experience by doing. Skilled leadership can be
found in the untapped reservoir of men in skilled positions
in business and industry.

This part of the pr0gram need not be expensive if the
technical, professional, and trade groups will back it up
with their experience. Material, tools, and equipment can
usually be ohtained from donations of local industries and
individuals, can even be found in the junkyard. Govern-
ment and industrial surplus and rejects are available
through several agencies.

Suggestion

Five dollars will buy a year’s subscription to the Lihrary
Service of the National Aviation Education Council, 1025
Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington 6, D.C. This serv-
ice supplies scveral pamphlets and other items on a monthly
basis, plus additional books as they are printed during the
year. Most important of all is the material they supply,
giving sources of low-cost and free materials, including
films, charts, pictures, books, and so forth suitable for a
program of this type.

The fine thing about a program of this kind is not only
that it stimulates, and tries to satisfy, the curiosity and in-
tcrest in youth in the expanding world around them, but
that it can start in low gear. As it gains momentum, as more
and more people are drawn into it, and as it expands, it
can splinter into special-interest groups. Many youngsters
today know more about modern technology and are more
interested in it than the adults around them. Informal ex-
ploration of personal interests through informal recreation
can olTer a new challenge to youth, help them channel their
interests, and encourage them to pursue these by continuing
their education. #

THE CHURCH

AND RECREATION

“Recreation should be considered as a necessary element in the
scheme of living, otherwise life becomes lopsided. The chnrch has
a responsibility for helping people to make intelligent use of leisure

time.” — E. O. HARBIN

C. O. Jaekson and Jaek Lindberg

adults playing volleyball or exercising, children and

adults engaging in rhythms, crafts of many sorts,
picnics, hikes, all this and much more is commonplace at the
First Methodist Church in Champaign, Illinois. The pro-
gram, now beginning its third year, is a success.

In the beginning, the program included religious edu-
cation, choir, and recreation, in three or four weekly after-
school or Saturday sessions. This functioned well except
that free play for the youngsters was soon found to be a
poor substitute for an organized program. Then, too, on
Saturdays, during school holidays, and sometimes in the
evenings, individuals or groups often used the facilities.
\Vith little or no supervision or leadership, an impossible
situation soon arose.

A number of interested laymen on the board of stewards
decided to do something about this and, after considerable
discussion, came before the board with a proposal: an agree-
ment to underwrite a broad program, on a trial basis, for
a three-year period.

The following guides were developed by the committee:

1. Start with groups now having some recreation, expand
programs rapidly, add other groups.

2. Plan broad program of active and quiet activities,
omitting dramaties and music, since these are already em-

 IAPPY CHILDREN roller skating in the gymnasium,

phasized by other groups.

3. Some of the program should be coeducational. Family-
night programs should be added.

4. The program should be planned by the director, with
the help and advice of the department of recreation at the
University of Illinois and approved by the subcommittee of
the Commission on Education, appointed to serve as a liai-
son between the recreation program and the commission.

5. There should be frequent reports to this committee by
the director of recreation, and frequent re-examination and
re-evaluation of the program and its progress.

6. Adequate supervision should be provided by an adult

linois and was hired by the First Methodist Church to conduct
its recreation program. MR. JACKSON is head of the depart-
ment of physical education for men, University of Illinois.

\

leader, and one or more other responsible adults. Adult
interest is necessary and should be encouraged.

7. Money must be provided for the necessary equipment
and materials as the program expands and develops.

8. The members of the recreation staff should advise and
help with recreation and social matters, such as parties,
picnics, family nights, and the like.

9. The program should enhance character, spiritual
growth, and good health. Safety must be stressed.

10. The director of recreation, his staff, and the subcom-
mittee on recreation must remember that this new program
is only a part of the total church program.

We began with an interest Survey:

The Survey. Field workers and students majoring in rec-
reation were secured from the university to help, and an
interest questionnaire was eventually returned by more
than four hundred individuals.

THIS SURVEY accomplished a twofold purpose. First, it
clarified the activities ehurch membership was inter-
ested in supporting, and second, it created much interest in
the prOposed program. Questionnaires were distributed by
church-school teachers in their classes, the students checked
their personal interests, and returned the blanks to the
church oflice. Those not attending church-school were
handed the blanks as they left the church services. The
distribution took place on two succeeding Sundays. Of the
1,850 families registered in the church, 1,000 were reached
in this manner, with a forty-seven-percent return from this
group.
Facilities. Facilities at the church include a gymnasium
with basketball court, a stage at one end, and a small equip-
ment room containing more than one hundred pairs of rink
skates, basketballs, volleyballs, and play equipment of all
kinds. Since the program has been in effect, a pledge class
from a local fraternity cleaned the gymnasium floor as a
service project, and lines for badminton and volleyball have

been added.

It was decided the primary efforts would be toward rec-

RECREATION

 

 

motion for boys and girls, men and women of our own
church. Accordingly, a recreation-activity card was de-
signed to serve as admission as well as identification. A
different color card is used for each year. At stated inter-
vals, a member may bring a guest.

VI‘HI-I SURVEY showed a definite desire for craft projects.
Soon, copper enamcling, matchstiek projects, shell-
craft. baskctry, soap carving, construction of mobiles and
puppets, and writing original puppet shows were under way.
Pupils in the third through the sixth grades were already
meeting on Thursday afternoon for choir practice and re-
ligious education, so we began our recreation programs
avith this group, working in cooperation with the children’s
I choir director. Simple games and creative dramatics were
used. Springtime Saturday mornings inspired trips to farms
in the area and picnics in a nearby park. On Saturday af-
ternoons, the third, fourth and fifth grades now meet at
the church for craft activities, followed by roller skating.
Those in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades meet on
Saturday afternoon also, but alternate their participation
in the activities just listed with the younger group. The
lattendance at the Saturday afternoon sessions averaged
from ninety to one hundred. On Tuesday nights, the junior-
high-school-age boys have their own intramural basketball
Ileague of six teams. Team captains are elected by the boys
I and are responsible for getting their teams organized.
Because many new personal adjustments must be made
at this age level, social experiences are needed most here.
lThese are held on Friday or Saturday nights, and may in-
clude a splash party at the local “Y”, an ice-skating party
[at the university rink, roller skating, a fun or game night,
or a square-social evening. Regardless of the event, the
group always returns to the church for a fellowship period.
1 Little has been done to plan special affairs for the high-
school group, so far, because the present school program
.‘scems to provide sufficient activities for them. The recrea-
Ition personnel have, however, supplemented the District
Methodist Youth Fellowship meetings and the winter re-
i'trcats with social activities, working in an advisory capacity
with the social committees.
l Two active “Young Marrieds” groups in the church hold
monthly “potlucks,” followed by a social hour. The recre-
tion leader plans and provides social activities including
social and mixer games, folk games, simple dramatics, and
occasional group singing.
The adult program includes a Men’s Night every Wed-
nesday evening, consisting of free exercise, basketball, and
calisthenics. This is followed by organized volleyball or
badminton. Average attendance is twelve to fifteen men,
.l.whose ages vary from twenty-three to sixty-four.
' An evening “Hips, Hips Away” class is provided for the
ladies, led by a field worker from the university. Primarily
Lomposed of middle-aged women, its attendance is around
ftcen. These two adult activities promise to attract more
artieipants in another season because of the interest and
Ynthusiasm of the present members.
Because there had been no “all-church picnic” for many

  
 
   
   
 
   
   
  
   
  
  
    
  
 
  

croaea 1959

years, it was decided that this would be a good activity to
close the year’s recreation program, in the late spring, and,
at the same time, give the people of the church a chance to
get together in an informal atmosphere. The first attempt
was a potluck picnic with games for everyone, and con-
tests for individuals and families. A great deal of enthu-
siasm was built up preceding the affair by posters and an-
nouncements in the church, and plans to continue this affair
as an annual event are promising.

A day camp was operated, for one week, for the elemen-
tary-school-age children, during the first week in J une, with
interested mothers, most of whom had had experience in
Girl Scouting, acting as unit leaders. There were five units
of nine children each, under the care of one or two high-
school seniors, acting as junior leaders. This permitth
more than the usual amount of personal attention for each
camper. A six-hour training session for the leaders on the
Saturday preceding the opening of camp oriented them to
the program. Nature crafts, terrariums, leaf prints, nature
hikes, cook-outs, storytelling, dramatics were all included.

IN ADDITION to these scheduled activities, recreation per-

sonnel is available to help any group of the church in
planning and scheduling of any recreation activities. Occa-
sionally they are called upon to aid the Boy Scout troop of
the church in their physical fitness program. Each Sunday
evening, the Methodist Youth Fellowship groups meet. These
groups include those in seventh grade through high school.
Each grade has about one-half hour to forty-five minutes
of organized recreation in its evening’s program.

It is obvious that a good beginning has only been made
with the younger people in our program so far. The adult
group has not been reached to any great degree as yet. Al-
though the majority of the church peeple have been ex-
tremely receptive to the program, there have, of course, been
some conservative members who are a little wary of such
activities in the church.

For this reason development of the program has proceed-
ed slowly and now there is almost unanimous approval. The
areas of future expansion in programing will be in the older
adult groups, with the organization of a senior members’
club, where there is already quite an interested nucleus.
From here on, ideas stretch out in all directions, to hobby
and adult craft workshops, dramatic clubs, adult retreats,
formation of nature-study groups, as well as interchurch
publications on ideas in programing.

We believe our recreation program has benefited every-
one who has been a part of it, including not only the partici-
pants but the field workers, the leader, and the committee
members. A well-grounded faith, attempts to meet people’s
needs, striving toward set goals, and constant selling of the
product, mixed with interested, dynamic, Christian leader-
ship are the ingredients for a successful church program. 1“}:

FIVE THOUSAND of our country’s

seven thousand hospitals do not

have recreation programs. Most
of these are small general hospitals,
with few long-term patients; conse-
quently, they do not feel they can af-
ford a full-time recreation director.
There are many communities that have
only one or tvs'o nursing homes or
homes for the aged, too small to afford
a full-time worker. If there are several
such homes in the area, they could suc-
ccssfully combine resources and engage
a recreation director to service all of
them. They eould buy basic equipment
c00perativcly and rotate it. Obviously,
this is not feasible if the area only has
one or two institutions.

The same situation exists with the
homebound in rural areas. There is
usually not a large enough number to
warrant a welfare or health agency’s
having a full-time recreation worker.
However, every community could serv-
ice its ill and handicapped population if
all institutions and agencies were com-

bincd into one project.

The National Recreation Associa-
tion’s Consulting Service on Recreation
for the Ill and Handicapped decided
to set up a demonstration-and-study
project to see if a community with less
than three hundred long-term chronic-
ally ill or handicapped people within it
could be serviced by one professional
worker with the help of trained volun-
teers. The purpose was to determine
whether or not an all-inclusive program
of this type is possible and to determine
the various problems and costs. The

project was not designed to include the

healthy aged, but it was impossible to
prevent them from coming to the homes
to join in the programs.

Sussex County in northern New Jer-
sey was chosen as a typical rural area.
This area had less than three hundred
people in the group to be studied.
These are in three hospitals with 150
people, four nursing homes, one wel-
fare home, and seventy-two home-
bound. Several foundations were ap-
proached to finance this program, and
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation agreed
to do so for one year. Philip Walsh was
engaged as project director. He had
been chairman of the Council for the
Advancement of Hospital Recreation
and had just left a position as recrea-
tion director at a psychiatric hospital.

Before the project was initiated,
owners of the various institutions were
asked three questions: Did they feel
recreation was needed in their nursing
homes? Did the people in charge of the
hospitals feel that such activities were
necessary? Were the owners and ad-
ministrators interested in being in-
volved in this project and, if successful,
would they carry it on with community
funds at the termination of the pilot
project? The answer to all three ques-
tions was yes. The hospitals felt only
the non-acutely ill patients and children
needed recreation.

Next step was formation of a Council
for Recreation for the Ill and Handi-
capped, composed of leading citizens
in the county interested in health and

welfare. Those serving on the council
are one hospital administrator, the
chairman of the county governing body,
manager of the local radio station, di-
rector of the county welfare board,
chairman of the hospital hoard, super-
visor of casework in the county, presi-

dents of both auxiliaries serving in the
largest hospital, and several volunteers
interested in Specific areas, such as

usic, crafts, and outside entertain-
ment. The council meets monthly and
actively helps the project in many ways,
with such matters as publicity, recruit-
ment, equipment, and so on.

D umxe TntS initial stage Mr. Walsh
visited and studied some excellent
programs in New York City, particu-
dlarly in nursing homes. He was greatly
impressed with the energy and enthu-
Isiasm the patients throw into these pro-

ams and the roerams’ success. He

Iahen visited the hospitals and homes in
ussex County. He felt that a number
of these people have become senile
through inactivity and some were un-
able to use their potential physical
Itrength because of lack of opportunity
or activity. It became apparent to him
hat a financially feasible way must be
I{found to service rural areas in bring-

_ The Recreation Council for the Ill

list of basic supplies that would rotate
to the different homes, as well as games,
arts-and-crafts materials each indivi-
dual institution would need. The cost,
for the three hospitals, four nursing
homes, and one welfare home, was less
than a thousand dollars.

From the middle of February to
mid-\farch, every available means of
publicity was used to recruit volunteers
for training on the project. At the end
of March, it was evident that further
effort was needed. As the people who
had come to this first meeting were, in
the main, presidents and directors of
civic and fraternal groups, the training
date was moved up three weeks, to give
them time to recruit within their own
groups.

The next three weeks were spent in-
terviewing prospective volunteers, by
making personal calls to local plants,

schedule of the workshOp, an applica-
tion blank with a list of various activ-
ities that might interest him, and an
information sheet asking in which hos-
pital or home he would like to volun-
teer, which day, and at what time. Vol-
unteer training classes ran from the end
of April to the middle of May, two
evenings a week, for two-hour periods.

Workshops consisted of sessions on
arts and crafts, special activities, social
events and games, the role of the vol-
unteer, music, a talk on the emotional
aspects of illness by a psyehologist,
and, finally, a discussion and review
session. The workshops were directed
by specialists from different fields, pro-
vided by the National Recreation As-
sociation. In almost every community,
the local music, art. or high school can
provide teachers with specific abilities
adaptable to the ill and handicapped.

Five volunteers were each assigned
to a hospital or home. The owner or
administrator helped familiarize them
with the institution’s routine. Once fa-
miliar with the setting and the patients,
they began to participate in the activi-
ties planned by the recreation director.

AT THE present time the nursing
homes are serviced two afternoons
and two evenings a week, one hospital
only one day and evening, and the wel-
fare home five sessions a week. As
more and more volunteers are recruited
and trained, it will be possible to service
the other two small hospitals and the
homebound. If all goes well, it will be
possible to include the county’s two
hoarding homes for senior citizens.

As this project devel0ped, it has be-
come more and more evident that one
good recreation administrator can serv-
ice up to three hundred patients, in dif-
ferent homes or hospitals, if he has an
adequate well-trained staff of volun-
teers. Over and above the salary and
expenses of the director, that of the
basic equipment, and less than one dol-
lar per patient per month for running
expenses, there has not been any addi-
tional cost.

So far there has been only one large
problem: how to document and analyze
a method for the county to finance this
project on its own. For the project to
be successful, there must he a way to
charge those who receive the recrea-
tion services. This is particularly diff-
cult because the homes having the best
volunteers need the least time or atten-
tion of the recreation director. flow-
ever, within the next year, the eonsnlt-
ing service hopes to develop a clear-ent
plan for providing recreation to the ill
and handicapped in any community on
a coordinated, cooperative basis. #

Ice skating comes of age in Essex County, New Jersey,
as crowds flock to these new facilities. Here are the
practical details of construction. Management and
program will be presented in the November issue.

Harold J. Van Cott

TWO NEW ICE RINKS

CE SKATING provides wholesome physical activity for
I the whole family, from the youngest tot to grandpa.
This enjoyment may derive from figure skating, speed
skating, hockey, or just plain skating for fun. They all re-
quire grace and coordination and help improve posture and
poise. It is an activity that may be enjoyed by an indi-
vidual as well as a group. The skating season, coming when
other recreation opportunities are somewhat limited, serves
to round out a full twelve-month recreation program.

Essex County Park Commission has constructed two arti-
ficial ice skating rinks within the past three years, and per-
haps our experience can be of interest and help to other
public recreation officials.

There are two basic types of rinks, indoor and outdoor.
The outdoor rink, located in Branch Brook Park in Newark,
was the first of the two to be opened, in October, 1957. The
second rink, the indoor South Mountain Arena, located in

South Mountain Reservation in West Orange, was completed
last fall and opened November, 1958.

Indoor or Outdoor. The outdoor rink is less expensive to
build, but, on the other hand, the outdoor season is about
two months shorter than the indoor season and outdoor
skating is always subject to disruption by weather. How-
ever, elear weather will bring out large numbers of skaters
on outdoor rinks. Uninterrupted skating during a full seven-
or seven-and-a-half-month season is a major advantage of
the indoor rink. The South Mountain Arena, with its 2,650
seats, also makes it possible to present spectator events such
as hockey games and ice shows.

Rain and snow present a serious problem, and heavy pre-
cipitation definitely cancels outdoor skating. In addition,
because of heavy loads imposed on the refrigeration equip-
ment during warm days, the refrigeration capacity of the
outdoor rink must be greater than that of an equivalent in-
door facility.

Frankly, our experience covering only two seasons is in-
sufficient to justify conclusions about the number of days’
skating an outdoor rink can provide. At least five years’
experience will be necessary to draw any kind of realistic
picture; however most skating authorities estimate that out
of a possible 150-day season, an outdoor rink can operate
80 percent of the time, or about 120 days. If the outdoor
rink has a concrete Floor, it can be used in the summertime
for outdoor recreation activities, such as roller skating,
basketball, shufllcboard, volleyball, paddle tennis, and is
ideal for dances under the stars. The indoor rink can be
used for a variety of community activities requiring a large
indoor area.

The cost of the Branch Brook outdoor rink and all its
buildings and facilities, excluding land, was $330,000. Of
this, about one-half represents the cost of the rink floor
slab and the refrigeration equipment. Indoor South Moun-
tain Arena cost $950,000. This includes the building hous-
ing the rink and all its supporting facilities, with provisions
for future expansion, again excluding land. It was designed
by E. Nelson Edwards, an architect with two other indoor
rinks to his credit, and has proved very efficient.

Since labor costs are relatively high in Essex County,
it is possible these facilities could be duplicated elsewhere
for less. However, in seeking ways to economize on rink
construction, it is well to realize that a good foundation,
rink Floor, and refrigeration system are essential and can-
not be compromised on. If a skating rink is to built at all,
it should be done properly from the outset, with adequat
equipment, facilities, and provision for a full-time skating! L
program. It will pay off in the long run. -

There are four primary considerations in sueeessfullyl
establishing and operating an artificial ice-skating rink.
These are: (1) construction of the rink and its associated
services; (2) programing, the key to successful rink oper
ation; (3) rink operation and administration; and (4)
maintaining a public relations program, designed to arous
and maintain public interest in its recreation program?

Arena building, in South Mountain Reservation area of
West Orange, is both handsome and economical. a modern
version of the familiar Quonset hut. It opened in 1958.

Building a Rink. Ice is the basic product, so you cannot
skimp on the quality of the rink and equipment.

Site Selection. This is the first step in building an ice skat-
ing rink. For technical reasons, the land must be well
drained and capable of providing a sound foundation. If
it is to be an outdoor rink, the site should aISo be protected
from prevailing winter winds.

PROPER SITE selection will help insure satisfactory rink
construction. Other factors to be considered are ac-
cessibility, adequate parking area, and location of public
transportation. The South Mountain Arena occupies a 12-
acre area, has parking facilities for 513 cars, and is serv-
iced by two bus lines. Branch Brook Recreation Center is
served by numerous public transportation lines. If the rink
can be located so that it is seen by the public, this serves
as a valuable part of your publicity and public relations
program. Anyone who has visited Rockefeller Ccnter in
New York can testify to the appeal of an ice-skating rink
in public view.

Size is important if hockey is contemplated. The mini-
mum regulation hockey rink is 85 by 185 feet; both of ours
are 85 by 200 feet, in order to handle peak loads.

People in Essex County have accepted their new ice rinks
with great enthusiasm, as attested to by the following at-
tendanee figures. For the period extending from Novcmber
28, 1958, through April 26, 1959, the South Mountain Are-
na (indoor) racked up an attendance of 128,226 skaters.
At Branch Brook, 73,000 people skated from October 17,

1958, through March 15, 1959. In its first year of opera-

tion, Branch Brook chalked up an attendance of 95,000;
the lower figure for the second year was caused by the very

bad weather that winter. In a normal season, we can ex-
pect about 100,000 people.

Construction. A permanent rink foundation consists of a
gravel or crushed-stone base, topped by a reinforced con-
crete subfloor. This subfloor is insulated from the main
rink floor by a vapor barrier of asbestos or tar paper. Pipes
to carry brine, circulated by the refrigeration system, are
laid on supports over the paper. Finally, the main rink
floor is poured over the pipes.

Concrete for the rink floor must be carefully prepared,
poured, and leveled. The entire floor is poured in a con-
tinuous operation, and it is imperative that the concrete be
uniform throughout. Good finishing is a must, and the
level of the finished surface should not vary more than
one-eighth inch from true in any direction.

In some outdoor rinks, clean and washed sand or fine
gravel are substituted for the final concrete floor. It is filled
around the pipes and leveled to the top surface of the pipes.
This type of floor is cheaper than concrete and simplifies
repair of defective piping. However it imposes the annual
expense of maintaining a level floor, and it cannot be used
for any other purpose.

Refrigeration System. The primary component of the sys-
tem, and the one which determines its capacity, is the re-
frigerant compressor. Branch Brook is equipped with two
Worthington Corporation Model 6]F6 compressors, each
having a capacity of eighty-two tons of refrigeration. Be-
cause an indoor rink requires less refrigeration, the South
Mountain Arena has two sixty-ton capacity Worthington
Model 6JF4’s. All four units are high-speed, V-type, recipro-
cating compressors driven by electric motors. The refrig-
eration systems at both rinks are automatically controlled.

BOTH THE Branch Brook and the South Mountain sys-

tems employ Freon-22 refrigerant. At South Moun-
tain, there are two completely independent refrigeration
circuits, each of which is capable of maintaining ice by it-
self. The two circuits at Branch Brook use a common liq-
uid-refrigerant storage tank but are otherwise independent,
and, again, each is capable of maintaining ice by itself ex-
cept under the most abnormal weather conditions.

Basically each refrigeration system consists of a motor-
driven compressor that compresses the refrigerant. The
liquid refrigerant then passes through a chiller! through
which the return brine also circulates. In the chiller, the
heat picked up by the brine in its travel through the pipes
located beneath the rink floor, flows to the refrigerant, caus-
ing it to boil away. Thus cooled, the brine is returned to
the pipes beneath the ice and the evaporatcd refrigerant
is recondensed for use again.

The importance of the refrigeration system cannot be
overemphasized for it is truly the heart of an artificial rink.
In their combined three seasons of operation, there has been
no ice lost, at either Branch Brook or South Mountain,
because of equipment failure. Peter Carver Associates, re-
sponsible for many rinks in the country, designed the re-
frigeration systems at both of our new skating facilities.

Buildings. A minimum of buildings is required for an out-
door rink. The refrigeration equipment must be housed,
and so should the other facilities essential to successful rink
Operation, including a Zamboni ice resurfacer. At an in-

door rink all facilities and the ice are housed under one
roof.

THE NECESSARY facilities for effective rink operation are

as follows: office, checkroom, skate shop, first-aid
room, lavatorics, locker rooms, and a snack bar. Finally,
a relatively large area must be provided and equipped to
permit people to change into their skates. Checkrooms
should be of adequate size. The cheekroom at the South
Mountain Arena is equipped to accommodate more than
twelve hundred persons and at Branch Brook, approxi-
mately eight hundred.

Thc skate shop has several important functions, includ-
ing skate rental, maintcnancc, and skate sharpening. Both
Essex County rinks maintain five hundred rental skates and,
although there is always the problem of running out of spe-
cilic sizes, the number of rentals appears to be adequate.
Skate sharpening is almost an art, and most communities
supply few places where skates may be properly sharpened.
Serious skaters are most particular about this. The sale
of skate accessories is another important skate-sh0p func-
tion. Skate hooks, guards, and laces are always needed.

Another service provided by the skate shop at the arena
is skate sales. The need for this service is based on the
fact that improperly fitted and poorly made ice skates can
take more fun out of skating than any other single factor.
As a matter of fact, with well-built, properly fitted skates,
there is no such thing as a weak-ankled skater. Supple ankles
are an advantage to the skater whose skates are properly
fitted. For this reason, the South Mountain skate shop only
sells pr0perly fitted quality skates. A card system has been
established through which children receive an allowance
when they trade in outgrown skates for a new pair. The
trade-ins are then umd as rental skates. The commission
itself operates the skate shOp, snack bar, and the skate
rental and skate-sharpening services.

A snack bar is a necessary adjunct to a skating rink, for
several reasons. First, pe0ple do not skate continuously for
extended periods and the opportunity to st0p and eat a sand-
wich or drink somcthing hot is welcome. In addition, on-
a crowded day, people coming off the ice to eat make more
room for those on the ice. So a snack bar actually increases I
the capacity of the rink.

A room should also be set aside and equipped for emer-
gency first aid. Finally, besides standard public toilet fa-
cilities, a rink should also have two locker rooms equippe
with toilet and shower facilities, as well as storage lockers
and benches, and, of course, an equipment room.

Programing. Successful Operation of a rink depends Upon
the development of a comprehensive program and Operating
personnel to carry it out.

Part II of this article, which will appear in our next issue,
covers practical details of program, maintenance, on
personnel management.

no WILL PAY?” That is the
first question when an acci-

dent occurs and a liability
suit threatens.

A West Coast city reports $30,000
paid out in damages during the three
years prior to purchasing insurance
Iflocking the barn after the horse was
stolen). It also defended itself against
Idamage claims during that period of
lover $1,000,000. In a major North
.Carolina city, the recreation depart-
I-ment was the loser in a liability case
Ito the tune of $35,500.

In Michigan, a recreation depart-
ment employee was faced with the ex-
ll'pense of defending himself against a
“$250,000 liability suit. The judgment
against him was settled at considerably
rless than the quarter million dollars,
4'but the burden of payment and defense
ltwas unnecessary. It could have been
avoided if preper insurance coverage

Ind been in force.

1' Very few recreation employees are
aware of the liability exposures arising
:Irom their duties, or of the protection
available to them and to their depart-
ments. In states where public rcc-
‘reation is considered a proprietary
tunction, recreation departments and
[gencies can be held liable for injuries
unstained by participants and spccta-
pors if negligence or lack of supervision
tire indicated. The settlement or judg-
ent can be disastrous. In states where
eereation is considered a government
unction, the municipality or recreation
epartment is usually considered im-
une to liability suits. However. this
mmunity does not extend to the rec.

worker.

reation In fact, this very

agency immunity can direct the wrath
of the injured upon the recreation de-
partment employee. “Who will pay?"
can now be answered with, “Someone
will pay.” It is apparent the recreation
worker needs the security and assur-
ance of adequate protection against ac-
tual and presumed ncgligence liability
lawsuits.

Insurance, too, can he a lifesaver. A
modern court decision against a recre-
ation employce or department can, in
one blow, snuff out the financial life of
the individual or organization. The
answer is public liability insurance that
will not only provide defense against
lawsuits, but also pay the judgments
rendered by the courts. Coverage for
the recreation department should be
purchased on a comprehensive basis,
with $100,000 the absolute minimum
limit of bodily injury liability coverage
per person and $300,000 per accident.
Any good local agent can advise you.

Through the National Recreation
Association, as a service feature to
NRA Affiliates, excess public liability
insurance Up to $1,000,000 per acci-
dent, can be obtained by recreation de-
partments in large cities with a popula-
tion of 50,000 or more. The department
may eithcr self insure or purchase lo-
cally the first $10,000, or $25,000,
coverage. The excess insurance cover-
age over either primary amount is only
written on an individual basis. NRA
investigated the idea of a group excess
public liability plan for this coverage,
but insquirient interest was rcflectcd
from the field.

A study of case histories shows that
almost every phase of a recreation pro-
gram can be subject to accidents. either
to participants or to spectators. The

recreation administrator's responsibil-
ity is therefore quite clear. He should
know the hazards emanating from his
pregram and should recommend that
adequate coverage be purchased, to
protect the children and adults partici-
pating in reercation pursuits, and also
to safeguard the financial status of his
recreation unit. A substantial judg-
ment against a recreation department
can do irreparable injury to the devel-
opment of the municipal recreation pro-
gram. The fear of a liability suit also
can watcr down a program until its vi-
tality and benefit to the community are
sapped.

Last December the Association de-
veloped an insurance plan to protcct the
individual recreation worker against
personal liability suits. This “business
pursuits” plan has been made available
at the low individual rate of $2.63 per
half year and $5.25 per year, per person,
to all recreation employees and volun-
teers in NRA-afliliated agencies. The
coverage provided is $100,000 per oc-
currence. All recreation peOple should
check with their department or organ-
ization to avail themselves of this pro-
tection. The next filing date will be De-

cemb er 1, 1959.

Protection against ‘pure" accidents
is also available. This is not to be con-
fused with liability insurance. It is ac-
cidcnt coverage in the full sense. It
pays bills for accidents where there is

‘

no contributory negligence on the part
of the recreation department or rcc-
reation employee. thn an uninsurcd
accident occu rs, for example, a sprained
ankle at a teen-agers’ baseball game, the
results generally follow a pattcrn. The
injured, or his family, suffers the finan-
cial burden of medical bills, or the case
goes to a lawyer who may try to show
negligence on the part of the recreation
department or employee. In turn, this
requires the expense of legal defense,
or a token settlement. Also, the reerca-
tion department fecls morally obligated
to assume some or all of the medical
cxpenses incurred.

The solution is accident insurance
for the participants in the recreation
program. For a relatively minor pre-
mium, participants may be insured on
a per sport basis, or on a blanket activi-
ties basis. Individual team sport poli-

ance agents in most cities. However,
the National Recreation Association,
for the past five years, has offered a
policy for baseball and softball teams
at a considerably lower premium than
can be obtained locally.

The NRA also sponsors a blanket

recreational activities accident plan by
which all participants, age nineteen and
under, in both athletic and nonathletic
aclivities, may be insurcd at seventy-
iive cents per participant per year. This
plan is particularly well suited to a rec-

registration of between 150 and 2,000.
One hundred percent registration is
required.

In thc near future, the NRA hopes
to oller an all-sports accident plan for

to insure their tcam sports program on
a group basis. This obviates taking out
individual policics for each tcam sport.

reation Congress experiences, to enrich
a local community recreation program,
is illustrated by the April playground
“fcstival” in Mobile, Alabama, this
year. Martha Maitre, superintendent of
recreation in Mobile, attended the 39th
Congress in Long Beach, California,
and joined delegates in their visit to
Disneyland. Result: the mobile play-
grounds incorporated the Disneyland
theme “with the permission of Disney
himself,” according to the local press.
The Mobile Press Register of April 12
gocs on to say, “Everything possible
has becn included—Main Street U.S.A.,
Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Fantasy-
land, and even Adventureland!” The
space ships, the cruise boat moving
slowly through the jungle and into Ad-
ventureland, trolleys, surreys, and an
lndian village, wcre not overlooked.
These were presented in separate
scenes, in a production representing
a communitywide playground program.

It’s all in knowing how to look for
ideas, and in recognizing one when you
meet it face-to-face.

“Jump for Joy”

From skin to scuba diving, we now
take to the air and, according to The
New York Times, “jump for joy,” at
the recently opened parachutc sports
center at the airport in Orange, Massa-
chnsctts. Pleasure parachuting is grow-
ing in this country and has long been
popular in Europe. This is mostly the
result of one man’s vigorous crusade—
that of Jacques André lstel, proprietor
of Parachutes. Inc. and vice-president
of the nonprofit Parachute Club of
America. An ex-\larine, lstel organized
the first U.S. jumping team in 1956.

At Orange, he demonstrates his new
concept of jumping, called sky-diving.

this sport is “safe as swimming.” Of

cautions are carried out, preceded by
an intensive training period.

“Vision to Actuality”

Four years ago the State University
of Medicine, N. Y. (connected with
Kings County Hospital), approached the
Junior League of Brooklyn about start-
ing a children’s recreation program.
With the enthusiastic cooperation of;
the hospital, vision became actuality in
April of this year, when a gaily painted
pumpkin-orange-and-yellow playroom
was made out of an enclosed sunporch.

Part-time director Elizabeth Rosen
is assisted by a civil service recreation
leader, provided by the city. Half of
the program’s thirty-five volunteers are
Junior League members from Brooklyn.

LISTENING AND VIEWING

Where does UNICEF money go? What
does the money buy? These are ques-
tions the various recreation depart-
ments sponsoring Trick or Treat for
UNICEF (United Nations Children's
Fund) on Halloween, should be able
to answer. As part of your pro-Hallow-
cen briefing program in your commu-
nity, we suggest you show some of the
excellent educational films, made by the
various United Nations organizations
to explain their work. The films de-
scribed below, particularly good for
children, are equally informative for
adults. Remember an alerted, informed
public is a cooperative and generous
one.

Order your UNICEF Halloween plan-
ning and publicity material—aside
from films—from: U. S. Committee for
UNICEF, P. O. Box 1618, Church Street
Station, New York 8.

Overture would make a particularly
good lead-off film, because it is a superb
overall depiction of the United Nations
work in all its many phases, in both war,
its aftermath, and in peace. There is no
narration; the moving story of the UN
is reeled off against a symphonic back-
ground of Beethoven’s Egmont Over-
ture. Black and white; running time:
10 minutes.

Big Day in Boga is a fascinating 16
nnn. color film. shot in the French Cam-
eroons in Africa, showing how the op-
position of the juju or witch doctor, had
to be overcome, so the chief could let
French administration officials and UN
people into the village to help eradicate
the malaria felling eight out of ten peo-
ple in this once healthy village. Run-
ning time: 15 minutes.

Open Your Eyes, a 16-minute, 16
mm. color film, narrated by Boris Kar-
loff and produced by the World Health
Organization, illustrates how the Mor-
ocean government was able to organize
health teams for the treatment of tra-
chonia and conjunctivitis, with the
medical advice of WIIO and supplies of
drugs and equipment from UNICEF.
Self-treatment with antibiotic ointment
is easy and successful, once learned
from health workers.

Three 0/ Our Chihfren, in color, nar-
rated by James Mason and running 30
minutes. gives a threefold picture of
UNICEF operation in three different
countries.

The first is Crccce, where we are
shown how a seven-year-old girl, strick-
cn with polio, is taken from her almost
inaccessible mountain village to a city
where she receives vital treatment and

rehabilitation, With the help of UNICEF
funds.

We next meet Modjcna from French
Equatorial Africa. He is a victim of
leprosy—a disease shadowed by a tra-
dition of exile and humiliation, even in
the so-callcd civilized Western world.
This is the story of how his plight is
overcome when a doctor comes to his
village with a traveling UN health team
and treats him with a “strange” medi-
cine—sulfone.

The next stop is Luzon in the Philip-
nines. This is the story of how old-
fasbioncd and often fatal midwifery is
gradually being supplanted by methods
learned in the UNICEF-assisted training
courses, pictured for the first time in
this film. In this area, previously, one
out of every ten babies, lucky enough
to be born alive, died before his first
birthday.

All films are available through As-
sociation Films, in liidgefield, New Jer-
sey; La Grange, Illinois; Dallas. Texas;

. One of the problems ree-
reation people face as Sports
move indoors for the winter
is how to accommodate var-
ying numbers of Spectators
in a large multiusc space,
such as a gymnasium. The
Husscy Closed Deck Roll-
Out gym seats efficiently
answer this problem. The
manufacturers claim theirs
is the only one with this closed-deck feature, which elimi-
nates the possibility of slipping or falling through the
stands, dr0pping things through the Opening, including
trash—to the annoyance of anyone who may be standing
underneath. This feature also saves janitorial time and
money. If the floor is to be used for another activity, the
stands can be folded up, intact with trash, and cleaned later.
Fire hazards are also cut down. Hussey seating is of box-
girder construction, with steel diaphragrns at the ends, to
make the unit even more rigid; provides a positive me-
chanical locking device; casters, horizontal and diagonal
bracing; and the paralleling device, to make them roll
straight. For complete details, write Hussey Manufacturing
Company, 591 Railroad Avenue, North Berwick, Maine.

0 A permanent, weatherproof sculpture material, Crea- :
Stone, adaptable to varying age levels and art ability, is a ,
specially formulated cast stone: Just add water to the de-
sired amonnt, mix in a waterproof container, and let stand
for twenty-four hours. Coming in three hardnesscs, it can
be carved with a knife, hacksaw blade, or spoon, none of
which need be sharp. This material is not hard on the
hands; can be finished with files, sandpaper, steel wool, or
turned on a woodworking lathe. It comes in colors, can be
painted, varnished, shellacked. Crea-Stone hardens pro-
gressively and can be worked until it is bone dry. It is a
natural for recreation programs with limited budgets be-
cause it requires no molds, no expensive kilns to install and
operate, nor glazes to get contaminated. Crea-Stone is not
limited to sculpture alone, may be used for relief maps,
model building, and so on, and can be modeled directly
over a paper or wire-mesh armature. For details write

INTRODUCTION TO
COMMUNITY RECREATION

Bv

George D. Butler

Director of Research and Assistant Executive Director,
National Recreation Association

New Third Edition
577 pages, $7.50

Introduction to Community Recreation is a thorough revision of a well-known and highly respect-
ed text and reference hook. It offers a comprehensive picture of community recreation in the
United States—its nature, importance, scope, and development.

The hook eomplctcly outlines the growth of the community recreation movement and describes
the activities and services comprising the conununity recreation program, the indoor and outdoor
areas and facilities used for recreation, the leadership personnel and its methods of organizing
and conducting activities.

Major emphasis is given to community recreation as an essential function of local government.

RECREATIONAL USE OF WILD LANDS

BY

C. Frank Brockman

Professor of Forestry, College of Forestry,
University of \Vashington

McGraw-Hill American Forestry Series
346 pages, $8.50

The first texthook to he puhlishcd in the rather specific hut increasingly important area of forest

and wild land recreation management, in which the author is a well-known authority. The hook

will serve as a useful reference for those interested in outdoor recreation. It notes some of the

major reasons for the importance of recreation in modern life. The hook thcu points out the re-
lationship of various types of public and private lands to recreational needs, considers the man- t
agcment and administration of recreational lands, and provides an historical outline of the dc-
velopmeut of current recreational land use philosophy.

Hobbies—The Creative Use of Leisure,

Margaret E. Mulac. Harper and Broth-
ers, 49 East 33rd Street, New York 16,
Pp. 27l, illustrated. $3.50.

This curiously unsatisfying book is
not at all typical of Miss Mulac's other
books. In spots it has the flashes of the
wit, humor, charm, and practicality that
have distinguished so many of her game
and party books. It lacks, however, the
hroadminded, unbiased approach; her
brief descriptions of possible hobbies
seem biased, in many cases, as far as
length given “each. Games and sports,
for example, are admittedly a very
large interest area but more could have
been included in types of games and
sports, and the satisfactions in them,
as against a passionate protest against
junior organized team sports, a point
somewhat out Of place in a book on
hobbies. Eight pages on letter writing
seem out of proportion to two para-
graphs on pets, one paragraph on reli-
gion, and about a page on church ac-
tn‘ities.

Any book on hobbies in general
should contain the best possible refer-
ences if it is to be valuable to a reader
who wants to follow up some sugges-
tions. Here, again, this book is curi-
ously uneven. No information is given
as to whether a book is out of print; no
reference is given any annotation. In
one case, for example, a book listed on
wild flowers was printed in 1926 and
has been unavailable for many years.
Yet there have been excellent books on

The Earth Beneath the Sea, Francis P.

275, photographs. $5.00.
Dangerous Marine Animals, Bruce W.
Halstead, M.D. Cornell Maritime Press,
Cambridge, Maryland. Pp. 146, pho-

Here are two new books of fascinat-
ing and useful information for skin-
divers and others interested in knowing
more about the sea. The first, illus-
trated with sketches, graphs, and pho-
tographs, deals with the mysteries of the
ocean floor—the continental shelves,
mountains, canyons which make up
seventy-two percent of the earth’s sur-
face— and is for those without technical
kuowlcdge.

The second, especially timely right
now in light of recent shark scares, de-
scribes marine organisms that bite,
sting, are nonedible, and often danger-
ous. Similarly illustrated, this can be
of value to other swimmers, physicians,
biologists, shell collectors, beach ex-
plorers, and nature groups.

Book Week—November l-7

WOll'l'll EXPLOIUNG

Co Exploring in Books: This is the
theme of the 1959 Book Week, Novem-
bcr 1-7, sponsored by the Children's
Book Council. This would be an ex-
cellent time for recreation departments,
in cooperation with their local libraries,
to arrange a special book display or
put on a book fair. Colorful posters and
materials for such an event are avail-
able from the Council at 50 West 53rd
Street, New York 19. Such a display or
fair might well give special prominence
to a number of excellent books issucd
recently that were written primarily for
young readers but are of interest to the
recreation leader as well. These supple-
ment various aspects of the recreation
program, such as art or crafLs, nature,
and conservation, or lend themselves to
creative dramatics. They would make
fine prizes or presents. Among interest-
ing new publications are:

A WORKSHOP or Yoea Own, Martha
Lincoln and Katherine Torrey. Hoagh-
ton M iylin, 2 Park Street, Boston. Pp.
148. $2.50. The authors are the direc-

tors of a successful workshop for chil-
dren, the Bantam Workshop, and their
book is designed to help the child
acquire skills in working with wood
and tools. The simple directions can
be read and easily understood by
fourth graders. Here are directions
for making chock-a-block peOple and
chunkies (animals of blocks and
straight pieces of wood), barges,
castles, and dragons.

about it, they too can think up new

Do You SEE WHAT I SEE? Helen Bor-
ten. Abelard-Schuman, 404 Fourth.
Avenue, New York 16. U npaged. $2.75.
This is an exciting introduction to art.
Slanted lines, you see, “are like a see-
saw—sometimes they go up, and some-
times they-come down.” Some lines are
thin and delicate as a spider web, others
ragged as a barbed-wire fence. Then
there are the shapes and colors that
make the world a great big painting
to look at and enjoy. This beautiful
book, in four colors, will put “vision”
into seeing and help children escape
the flat, literal “looking” done by adults.

SOUNDS ALL AROUND, Tillie S. Pine
and Joseph Levine. W hittlesey House,
330 W. 42nd Street, New York 36. Pp.

48. $2.50. If children really listen

they can hear a bottle sing and play
different notes on a drinking straw.
They can hear sounds, feel sounds, and
make sounds. This book is full of the
“how” and the “why” of sounds, from
the brushing of teeth to the making Of
rhythm instruments.

ANIMAL TRAVELLERS, Marie Neurath.
Sterling Publishing, 419 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 16, Pp. 36. $2.00. This

nature hook for the preteen group ex-
plains the strange migrations Of the
world’s most interesting insects, birds,
fish, and animals. With simple dia-
grams and color illustrations, the book
tells of thc journeys of the Arctic terns
that fly from Pole to Pole, the return of
salmon to their spawning grounds, the
march of crabs from the hills to the sea,
the migrations of the mountain hares.
Young nature lovers should be en-
