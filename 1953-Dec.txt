IN AMERICAN LIFE

By Frederick W'. Cozens and Florence S. Stumpf

Operating on the thesis, “Study a
man’s pleasures, and half of him is
known," the authors have produced
a basic book on the sports we enjoy
and their relation to our unique
American way of life. Within the
framc of reference of our Culture,
they have studied the family, the
school, the sports page, radio and

and the government—all in relation
to sports. There is nothing clse like
it for the sports enthusiast or the
teacher of sports. $5.00

RECREATIO]

Wpaquzmm

'hilosOphy is concerned with values.
urpose is to “shed some light upon
[path” we are to travel. In recreation
' a common body of values is
d to give it uniform direction,
ming and purpose, and to serve as a
ring point for the profession.
Fllere are these values to be found?
H are their origins? Recreation
hrs must know the sources of values‘
recreation and be able to discover
ie values for themselves, for only in
way can they really understand and
jpt them as their own. No ready-
ie list will suffice unless one
roughly understands and agrees with
processes by which another arrived
these values. Plato once defined a

e as a person who executes the pur-
of another.

I'any of the values we consider im-
bant have their origin in the nature
meaning of democracy which, in
1, derives many of its concepts from
'stianity and democracy. Since the
eme importance of the individual,
ignity and value of human life, is
aramount significance in our way
fe, it follows naturally that depart-
s of recreation, schools, other
prnmental units and all other
ueies of society should begin their
'(‘h for values by asking this ques-
I: What are the basic needs of
Ian beings? The determination of
ature of these needs and the means
vhich recreation can help satisfy
is one of the major problems of
field.
uman beings rarely live entirely
t from other human beings. They
an integral part of a community of
r individuals each of whom 1nust
Ible to take his place in society as
)cialized human being with the at-
des, qualities, and skills essential
1e is to be an effective and happy
ten in a democracy. Society has a
it, in fact, a responsibility, there-
5, to demand that all its public
rcies of a social nature shall make
greatest possible contribution to the
plopmcnt of the qualities of the good

citizen in a democracy.

In the nature and needs of human
beings and in the nature and needs of
American democracy are to be found
the values for which recreation should
strive. If we would attain professional
status we must not only define our aims
but invest them with a social purpose
and then pursue them intelligently with
a sense of mission and of dedication.

Individual Fulfillment

All living things have needs. The
higher one goes in the scale of life the
greater and more diverse become the
needs of the living organism. Man, the
highest»form of life on this earth, has
needs so numerous and varied, and so
vital to his general welfare and happi-
ness that much of his existence consists
of a continuous series of attempts to
satisfy these deep-seated needs, or
drives. The extent to which he succeeds
is, in a very large sense, a measure of
his personal fulfillment; the extent to
which he fails is a measure of human
frustration, maladjustment, unhappi-
ness and, in many instances, illness or

death.

Among the basic needs of human
beings are the need for activity or move-
ment; the need for recognition, status,
and self-direction; the need for group
acceptance; the need for new and in-
teresting experiences or adventure; and
the need for expression. In the satisfac-
tion of these needs, in the attainment
of the goals of personal fulfillment, rec-
rcation has an important part to play.

Growth in Democratic H uman
Relationships

It is not enough that individuals
develOp their powers and capacities
simply as individuals without reference
to other human heings. The strong man
may use his strength to injure those
who are weaker than he. The attainment
of status and of self-direction may be
the prelude to domination of others;
group acceptance may lead to gangster-
ism, the need for adventure to crime,
and expression of the aggressive drive
to brutality and sadism. The fundamen-
tal needs of human beings must be satis-
fied and their capacities developed

with reference to a standard of conduct,
a code of behavior, which is based upon
moral and ethical principles—in short,
with reference to democracy and what
it means in terms of human relation-
ships.

We leaders in recreation have been
too long divorced from great social
issues. As John Collier puts it we have
been too often conducting “pigmy pro-
grams seeking pigmy results amid giant
opportunities.” We can make a great
contribution to the forces of freedom
in this world-wide struggle between
democracy and communism by (1) con-
ducting our programs in harmony with
democratic principles or tenets and (2)
by working with youth and adults in
such a way as to assist in developing.
many of the qualities of the good citizen
in a democracy. For, in the final analy-
sis, this struggle will be decided in
favor of those forces which are able to
prove that their way of life is a better
way of life for all mankind than is the
way proposed by their enemies.

Some may say that the development
of citizenship qualities in youth is a
job for education, not for recreation.
Actually the attainment of educational
values from a recreation activity—pro-
vided the activity is pr0perly conducted
——in no way detracts from the recrea-
tion values but, in fact, enhances them.
Those who would have recreation lead-
ership concern itself solely with enjoy-
ment and happiness, without regard for
the so-called educational values, not
only are burying their talents in the
ground and denying to recreation a
tremendous educational significance,
which it rightly possesses, but in the
long run will achieve neither enjoyment
nor happiness.

My philosophy of recreation, there-
fore, revolves largely around two basic
concepts, the supreme importance of the
individual and the vital significance of
the Democratic Ideal. So oriented and
so directed recreation rises above the
trivial, the frivolous, the immaterial
and assumes an importance comparable
to the other great areas of life—educa-
tion, religion, and work. The ultimate
test of the success of a program of
recreation will be the extent to which it
enriches human life and contributes to
the preservation and strengthening of
American democracy.

Salaries

Sirs:

Mr. Sutherland’s article in ., the
October 1953 issue of RECREATION is
very timely.

We are very much interested in the
salary problems at this time as we
are undergoing job analysis and work-
ing on the 1954 Budget. If you have a
comparative chart showing suggested
salaries for other recreation positions,
as well as superintendent, supervisors
of recreation centers and directors of
neighborhood recreation ecnters, we
,would appreciate a copy or two.

Bicycle Safety
Sirs: '

The Dodge City Recreation Commis-
sion in Dodge City, Kansas, has experi-
mented with a bicycle safety program
and we think we have some worthwhile
information to pass on to other recrea-
tion commissions.

Through the police department, fire
department, and recreation department
the following program was established.
After reading the article in RECREATION
magazine on the use of Scotch-Lite tape
for bicycles (January 1953, page 4198)
the recreation commission purchased
Scotch-Lite tape for all bicycles in city.
Firemen at the various stations applied
the tape on bicycles, free of charge,
when owners presented a bicycle regis-
tration card. Bicycle registration cards
were obtained from the policc depart-
ment with the purchase of bicycle
license plates. This registration card
served as a driver’s license for all
hicycle owners.

We then set Up a bicycle safety patrol
and bicycle safety court. The bicycle
safety patrol was established through
the cooperation of the school principals.
Each principal appointed eight children
to the bicycle safety patrol in his school.
Rules and regulations were established.
It was the duty of the safety patrol to
enforce the rules and regulations. All
members who were chosen attended
bicycle safety lectures given by the
police department.

The bicycle safety court was made up
of students from the junior high school.
Each court session consisted of one
judge and five jurymen under the super-

390

- OCettenA

 

vision of the police traffic judge. The
safety court was held at ten every Sat-
urday morning and the judge and jury-
men changed for every session of court.
No money was involved in the penalties
handed down by the court. Periods of
impoundment of the bicycles were the
fines imposed upon the bicycle owners
in accordance with the seriousness of
violation.

After almost a year’s experiment with
this program, our violations have de-
creased eighty per cent and the chil-
dren, by participating as patrolmen and
serving in the court procedures, have
become conscious of bicycle safety.

tendent, Dodge City, Kansas.

The Handicapped Child

Sirs:

In the November issue of your maga-
zine you state that you are interested
in “What the Playground Can Do For
the Handicapped Child.”

The playground, if properly super-
vised, can fulfill an essential role to
satisfy the need of the child upon whom
limitations have been imposed through
his or her handicap. The playground
director may serve as a loving helper
to assure the child of being wanted,
thereby giving him or her the feeling
of security and acceptance. This will
help to overcome the feeling of timidity
in the presence of normal, healthy
children. The alertness and speed of
the average child frightens the less able
youngster into the background.

Children can be cruel to those less
capable than themselves and may cause
sadness and shyness in the handicapped
child. Here the director has the oppor-
tunity to guide and educate the normal
children in their responsibility towards
the others. In the presence of other
handicapped children, the contrast may
serve to develop a sense of gratitude for
what capabilities one does possess.

The child can be encouraged to ex-
press himself more freely without fear
of abuse or ridicule from over-confi-
dent, and sometimes hostile, children
In the director’s role of “referee,” all
children involved may be encouraged
to “love one’s neighbor as one’s self.”

The supervisor can help develop the
child spiritually—help him to know
that he is God’s perfect child. He may
also explain Jesus’ love for little chil-

 

dren and offer the child hope in l
“miraculous” healings are occurr
frequently. Hence Divine Love may
as much for others who have faith :
are pure in heart.

The leader can point out exam]
such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and m
others who made notable strides in
in spite of handicaps. Often handic
are incentives or challenges 'to g]
contributions to the community,
nation, or the,world. Too often tall
lie dormant for fear of expression. '
love, friendship and guidance of a p'
ground director can very well be
turning point in the life of a ha]
capped youngster.

In a playground, the child will cc
into contact with many children,
opportunity which may otherwise
denied him.

All children are receptive to kind:
and can easily be led in the path
right thought and activity, which ‘
serve to make their lives full and r
Feed the famished affections and
little one will blossom into matu‘
with hope and a sense of accompl
ment to make living truly worth wh

It was Christmas Eve long ago in a wilderness. Snow
floated tO earth in great feathery flakes. It was as still
as death. Only the Balsam sighed as Winter’s breath
caressed its myriad needles. Its forest companions
were deep in their cold sleep.

Through the drifts a ragged, bleeding figure crept
and fell in a heap under the tree. Compassionately the Balsam
lowered its branches as a shelter. The figure slowly revived and heard
the Balsam whisper, “Take of my gum and bind your wounds.”

Heeding the advice, the traveler soon felt strength returning. “Now,
rub my branches together and you shall have warmth,” sighed the
tree. After the flames came, the Balsam made a soft couch Of its twigs

Now that it had given Of all its possessions, the tree felt a glow
of happiness. Its very twigs gleamed as with a thousand candles.
Then a strange thing happened. The forlorn figure was suddenly
clothed in a glorious light and said‘, “Since this night you have
sheltered the Christ, evermore, you shall be the. symbol of Christmas
Eve, the night of the Shining Tree. This shall be your greatest gift.”

Before the social workers moved in,
parents were able to find useful things
for kids to do. They could, for instance,
clean out the basement and scrub the
front porch. They could cut the grass.
They could dust the furniture and go
to the store for a pound-and-a-half Of
hamburger.

When these things were done, they
were permitted to turn to wholesome,
non-supervised recreation. With a
great scorn for adults, my crowd went
to the hills and built cabins, learned
tO recognize the birds and animals,
fought pitched battles with rocks and
sticks, learned to swim in the Barksdale
hOle, explored newly-built houses,
stepped on nails, became infected with
poison ivy, tinkered with old auto-
mobiles, played baseball with a tin can

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

Denver, Colorado
September 11, 1953

Dear Mr. Rivers:

I am delighted to send greetings to those attending
the thirty-fifth National Recreation Congress in
Philadelphia.

We all recognize how richly leisure can contribute
to the life of the individual and of his community.
In free time, free men develop many of the talents
and attitudes so essential to democratic living --
be it teamwork, Sportsmanship or individual and
creative initiative. Today, since scientific devel-
opment of our natural resources and the efficient
organization of our industrial life have so vastly
increased the leisure time of Americans, it would
be particularly unfortunate if that leisure were
not wisely Spent. We can therefore be grateful
for your efforts in this important field.

In sending you my best wishes, I want to add a
special word of commendation to those devoted
men and women on the local boards and committees
responsible for the recreation services of the Na—
tion. May your deliberations in Philadelphia serve
to bring increasing benefits to our pe0ple.

Sincerely,

074/11..me

Mr. T. E. Rivers

‘RECREATION

 

THERE WAS a bursting-at-the-seams
look about the Bellcvue-Stratford
Iluring the last week in September as
.he full tide of 1,700 recreation leaders
and interested laymen flowed cheerfully
hrough corridors, in and out of meet-
g rooms, exhibits, elevators, restaur-
rats—and pre-empted every available
acility for business-at-hand at the big
heeting.
The persistence of warm summer
ather in Philadelphia, combined with
preponderance of tweed suits and
ther obviously new fall clothes, failed
dim the fresh look and eager light-
in-the-eye of their busy wearers.
Thc congress program, in the com-
Iete kit of materials presented to each
clegate upon registration, carried a
page of instructions as to location of
pongrcss services and meeting rooms,
Ind so on, but the usual number of
reople lost themselves, or their friends,
r their schedules and amiably milled
Ibout—finding all or none—and never
thinking to look at page nine.
Administrators were assured in man-
ner, with an expansive friendliness;
young exccutives, many of whom were
new to the scene this year, were as eager
a group as has ever assembled, fizzing
over with interesting ideas, questions
and problems in their own right. Pro-
gram leaders of public and private
agencics, hospitals and other institu-
tions, churches, industry, army special
services and the air force, were present

in generous and interested numbers,
contributing and taking away with
them the stimulation of exchanged ex-
pericnce and the widened horizons that
such an exchange can bring about.
Substantial numbers of civic leaders
who are aiding in the development of
national and local recreation programs
were also present.

Attendance covered forty-four states
and seven foreign countries. German
delegates, Dr. Ernst Korff, executive
director of the Agency for Community
Centers and Leisure-Time Activities, in
Munich, and Dr. Werner Koerbs, Vice-
president of the Physical Education
College of Cologne, stressed the serious
need for sponsored recreation programs
in Germany and the danger of allowing
refugees from Communist-dominated
sectors to remain idle. Notably out’-
standing this year, was the participa-
tion of lay leaders, both local and na-
tional, in the program throughout the
entire week. They took part in the
chairing and leading of a variety of
meetings as well as in the actual dis-
cussion sessions. A special meeting for
board members only was well attended
and all who participated were articulate
in their lively approach to shared
problems.

Members of the board of directors of
the National Recreation Association
who were present were Otto T. Mallery
of Philadelphia, chairman of the board;
Reverend Paul Moore, Jr., Grace
Church, Jersey City, New Jersey, first
vice-president; Miss Susan Lee, daugh-
ter of Joseph Lee, second vice-president,

F. W. H. Adams of New York; William
H. Davis of New York; Grant Tits-
worth, Noroton, Connecticut; Frederick
M. Warburg, New York and Mrs. Wil-
liam L. Van Alen of Edgemont, Penn‘
sylvania. NRA sponsors and citizen-
members of local recreation boards, pri-
vate agencies, and civic and youth serv-
ing groups represented every section of
the country. Among, these were Ray-
mond Firestone, vice-president of the
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company;
Mauricc du Pont Lee, president of the
board of park commissioners, Wilming-
ton, Delaware; Mrs. Bartlett B. Heard,
of the California state recreation com-
mission; Mrs. George H. Gorton, chair-
man of the public recreation board,

CONGRESS

— in Review

 

More than sixty prominent Phila-
delphia civic leaders were honorary
sponsors of the congress. Fredric R.
Mann, commissioner of the Philadel-
phia Department of Recreation was
host at a luncheon for this group on
Tuesday.

Among distinguished guests arriving
to address the big meeting were such
notables as Secretary of the Interior
Douglas McKay; Governor John S.
Fine of Pennsylvania; Vice-Admiral
H. G. Norman, general secretary of
National Playing Fields Association of
England; United States Air Force Air
University Commander, Lt. General
Laurence S. Kuter; Mayor Joseph S.
Clark of Philadelphia; Dr. Ralph W.
Sockman, famed minister of Christ
Church, New York City; Dr. Luther
Gulick, president, Institute of Public
Administration; and Hugh Pomeroy,
city planning authority.

Wives of delegates, too, were too
busy to be slowed up by summer wea-
ther. They had their own usual meeting
(presided over by Mrs. William Van
Men of the National Recreation As-
sociation board) and were entertained
at tea in historic Strawberry Mansion,
in Fairmont Park. They stood by their
husbands through thick and thin and
many a meeting, gave the Philadelphia
shopping district a thorough going-
over, and attended a special luncheon
and fashion talk at Strawbridge and
Clothier. In addition, special tours
were planned for them.

In fact, the local arrangements com-
mittee, headed by Robert Crawford,
deputy commissioner and superinten-
dent of recreation, with the help of
many local organizations, was busy
throughout the week doing everything
possible to make congress delegates
feel welcome and at home. An informa-
tion booth, near the registration desk,
was manned by Philadelphians through-
out each day.

The commercial exhibitors displayed
and gave first hand information on a
wide range of the products and ser-
vices, from miniature trains for parks

396

to materials for silk screening, which
they make available to recreation
leaders; and their fascinating and
colorful booths somehow withstood the
stampede between and after sessions.
In addition, more space was available
for educational exhibits this year. Fore-
most among them was a “live” arts and
crafts exhibit from the Baltimore rec-
reation department, offering continu-
ous demonstration and participation
activities under the able and friendly
leadership of members of the Baltimore
staff. The products displayed and made
on the spot were of exceptionally fine
quality.

All other congress services were
crowded—consultation room, press
room, registration desk, National Rec-
reation Association membership desk,
all space reserved for conferences, and
corridors—with groups of guests spill-
ing over into the congress administra-
tion offices where executives, associa-
tion staff personnel and local secre-
taries stumbled over each other in de-
termined attempt to discharge a ter-
rific workload and make the congress
as cordial, smooth-running and as suc-
cessful as possible. Facilities were so
congested that more space had to be
taken over, extra meetings scheduled.
Hotel staff remarked, from time to
time, that they had never seen such a
“hard-working convention.”

New in the press room was the press-
photograph service. Here, press photo-
graphers stood ready to take pictures
of delegates with their fellow leaders
from other states, or with congress or
association officials, to be sent, along
with a press release, to their home town
newspapers.

New in the consultation room was a
RECREATION magazine exhibit with a
staff member always in attendance—-so
that anyone wanting to discuss ideas for
articles, check up on old subscriptions
or take out new ones, sign cards for
Christmas gift subscriptions, examine
the new binders and so on, could be sure
of having the opportunity.

New in each section meeting was the
distribution of a bibliography of
articles on the subject under discussion,
which have appeared in RECREATION
during the past four years. Complete,

collated sets of these bibliographies'

were made available at the magazine
exhibit. ‘

For the second year, the rough draft,
containing summaries of all section
meetings was made available at cost-
price by the end of the week. It was
this project that kept the midnight oil
burning and mimeograph machine
humming in the secretary’s office
through the far reaches of the night.

Messages of greeting and good
wishes poured into the congress from
many sources. Among those arriving, in
addition to that of the President of
the United States, was a letter to the
National Recreation Association from
the Duke of Edinburgh, president of
the National Playing Fields Association
of England. It states, “Recreation in its
widest sense and the healthy rivalry of
games provide a natural outlet for the
energies of young people and an im-
portant part of the training of our
future citizens. On the two sides of the
Atlantic, our associations are striving
for the same end.”

Two new songs were introduced dur-
ing the congress: “We Build,” in which
words by Howard Braucher were set
to music by Mrs. Anne Livingston; and
“A Time to Play,” with music by Paul
Smith and lyrics by Hazel George. The
latter has been published by Carl
Fisher, of New York, and copies were
on sale at the congress.*

Evening Meetings

Thc throng turned out to capacity
for the first general evening session,
chaired by Otto Mallery, chairman of
the National Recreation Association
board, on Monday. After the invoca-
tion by the Reverend Paul Moore, Jr.,
first vice-president of the association,
the entire audience joined in the singing
of the national anthem, most effective
with special lights playing on the flag
of the United States—and the meeting
was underway. Mr. Mallery opened the
business of the evening with the read-
ing of President Eisenhower’s message
to the congress. (See page 394.) Fred-
ric Mann, commissioner of recreation
in Philadelphia and host to the congress,
was introduced, and the city’s enter-
prising mayor, Joseph Clark, Jr., gave
an excellent address. He stated that al-
though today’s tax burden is great,
local governments still are justified in
“spending public money to provide out-
lets for the leisure time of their citi-
zens.” He held that recreation is an
essential part of the program of any
great American community and that it
can make a big dent in the numbers
of citizens requiring treatment or hos-
pitalization for mental diseases. “In a
democracy,” he said, “elected public
officials respond to the pressures and
demands of the electorate. America’s
are committed,

metropolitan areas

through these pressures, to continua-
tion and expansion of governmental
activity in the recreation field. No
elected oHicial could retrace our steps,

eliminate recreation as a major func-
tion of local government and expect

re-election. Recreation has bccome a
governmental function, not from con-
sent but by demand, of the governed.”
At the conclusion of his spcech, the
audience gave him a standing ovation.

At this point a great swell of music
introduced a surprise and brought from
the wings, and from the back of the
house, the colorful championship Hege-
man String” Band of Philadelphia.
Their resplendcnt uniforms were sham-
rock green satin, a-glitter with sequin
trimming, while their marshal was
garbed in gold. Their large plumed
Indian head-dresses swept the applaud-
ing spectators, as their wearers paraded

down the aisle.

Herman Seflin, of the Philadelphia
recreation department, is musical direc-
tor of this group, and told us that this
is its thirty-third year of organization.
It plays for orphanages, organizations
of all kinds, gives free concerts to citi-
zens—and entertained as many as 150,-
000 people during the hot weather
months last summer. Members were
most generous with lively music for
the delegates, set many a toe to tapping
and called forth cheers and “bravos.”
Their interesting collection of instru-
ments included a bass viol, banjos, ac-
cordions,- guitars, violins and a saxa-
phone. As a closing number, they
played “The Bells of Erin,”—the theme

of the Mummer’s Parade this year.

Other entertainment for the session
included a tumbling demonstration by
boys of various ages, both tap and bal-
let dancing by girls in gaily colored
costumes—both groups from the Phila-
delphia recreation department—and in
contrast in size, an unusual rope-jump-
ing demonstration by four high school
girls from the small community of
Bristol, New Hampshire. This is an
important activity in Bristol, and has
been worked out by the girls in a unique
manner. They, by the way, furnished
their own costumes—simple, but effec-
tive uniforms—and paid their own ex-
penses to the congress, through their
local rope-jumping activities.

The Tuesday evening meeting was
ably chaired by Raymond Firestone,
who is the Akron sponsor of the “Na-
tional Mr.
Firestone urged corporations to look
more carcfully into the field of recrea-
tion as a significant opportunity for ser-
vice. In referring to’ corporate contri-
butions to the recreation field, he said,
“While it is not entirely new, much is
now being said about the responsibility
of corporations to give financial sup-
port to community services. It is re-
ported that corporations in 1951 con-
tributed ,well over 300 million dollars
to philanthropy.”

Recreation Association.

The first speaker, Governor John S.
Fine, stressed the need for recreation
in an atomic era. “Recreation has be-
come a pressing question for the
twentieth century American,” he stated,

“requiring greater consideration of
cooperative suPport on the part of pub-
lic and civic authorities, greater initia-
tive on the part of private organized
professional groups, and greater in-
terest in cultivating opportunities crea-
tively by the individual citizen.” He
brought out the point that “recreation
is an important key to inner concord
for the tension ridden human being.”

Lt. General Laurence S. Kuter, was
the other speaker of the evening, and
he took the opportunity, at the end of
his talk, to award to the National
Recreation Association, in behalf of
the Secretary of the Air_ Force, H. E.
Talbot, the highest air force citation
for civilians. (See page 401.) Said
General Kuter, “Only thirty years ago,
the idea that the military profession
and the recreation profession had any-
thing in common would have met with
incredulity, if not outright disbelief.
The fact that today we do meet on com-
mon ground in our concern for young
people, as well as in our concern for
the future of the free world, is a mea-
sure of the progress that has been made
in both our professions in the second
half of the twentieth century. Recrea-
tion and the sponsorship of community
recreation is a basic component of the
American way of life, an element of
our national culture. The right and
privilege of the individual to choose
leisure-time pursuits that are personally
gratifying to him is the essence of free-

dom.”

Next on the program came the pre-
sentation of awards to the winners of
the U. S. Air Force Service Club Pub-
licity Contest, by Mr. Prendergast, of
the National Recreation Association.
TheSe were accepted in behalf of the
winners by Miss Nancy Casey, Com-
mand Service Club Director, Head-
quarters Fifth Air Force, Far East, and
Miss Marjorie Miller, Command Ser-
vice .Club Director, Headquarters,
United States Air Force in EurOpe.
Sixty-three service club directors, from
many parts of the world, had submitted

398

entries consisting of publicity scrap-
books—pictures of exhibits, posters,
signs and other promotion media. The
three prizes, for the best publicity pro-
gram between July 1, 1952 and June
30, 1953, were won by service clubs
in Germany, Hawaii, and Japan, with
honorable mention going to a club in
Guam. The National Recreation Asso-
ciation provided udges for the contest.

A gaily attired group of boys and
girls from International House an-
nounced entertainment with Estonian
dances in the ballroom, thus closing the
session.

The Wednesday evening meeting was
treated to selections by the Temple Uni-
versity Concert Choir, under the ex-
pert direction of Mrs. Elaine Brown.
The word “treated” is used advisedly,
for their concert was beautifully ren-
dered and enthusiastically received.

Mr. Henry W. Meers, partner in the
firm of White, Weld and Company and
chairman of the Chicago Area Com-
mittee. of the National Recreation As-
sociation, chaired the meeting. Ad-
dresses of the evening were by Mrs.
Howard Braucher, widow of the late
president of the National Recreation

Kay, who heads the many divisions

which are concerned with ‘the recrea-

tion welfare of the United States, em-
phasized the importance of recreation
as a curb on crime. “There is an em-
phatic need,” he stated, “for public

officials to examine with more realism
the importance of better recreation op-

portunities as an effective weapon in
the struggle to protect the nation’s
yout .”

The Thursday evening meeting was
the gala affair of the congress—the ban-
quet. Dressed in best bib and tucker,
guests poured into the ballroom in a
gay mood. There they were served an
excellent turkey dinner while being
serenaded by a male quartet, sketched
by wandering artists, and having their

fortunes told and a future trip to the.

Ozarks foretold by a seer from the
state of Missouri. His prophecy was

correct, for the Missouri Resources and
Development Commission conducted a
“drawing” for a free trip to the Ozarks.
This was won by Miss Marie Berna-
towing, of Detroit, with three “runners-
up,” in case she can’t go.

DECEMBER 1953

Other General Sessions

Again this year, the morning period
from eleven to twelve-thirty was used
for general sessions on specific topics.
On Tuesday the meeting was chaired

by F. W. H. Adams, board member

of the NRA. Mr. Prendergast, in pre-
senting “A National Look at Recrea-

tion,” spoke of current trends and work
to be done in the recreation field, re-
ported on current and future projects

of the National Recreation Association,
and emphasized that an important func-

tion of the association is that of “acting
as the secretariat of the national recrea-
tion movement.” He defined the move-
ment as the hundreds, the thousands of
recreation workers, professional and
volunteer, and lay citizens interested in
recreation. “Such a movement,” he
said, “is apt to lack form and substance
because it is made up of innumerable
individual elements each primarily con-
cerned with a particular phase of rec-
reation and a specific community. How-
ever, it is from the movement as a whole
that the needs, ideas, leadership and
vision must come. It is, in my opinion.
the responsibility of the National Rec-
reation Association to provide'continu-
ing staff services on a national, regional

and state level.”

Dr. Paul F. Douglass, who is chair-
man of the NRA National Advisory

Comlnittce on Recruitment, Training

and Placement of Recreation Personnel
followed, and was helped in an excel-

lent presentation of his committee re-
port _entitled “Leadership for Recrea-

 

tion,” by the sub-chairmen of his very

active committee.

Last, but by no means least, was the
fine address on “Recreation and Re-
search” by Dr. Luther H. Gulick, chair-

man of the new NRA National Council
on Research in Recreation.

“There are many ways of testing the
hypothesis that men, especially modern
urbanized men, need and want recrea-
tion,” he said, “and that societies which
have such programs are better than

those which lack them. While we have
a right to state hypotheses on the basis

of our own limited experience and as
matters of faith, we have the obliga-
tion to test the assumptions with rig-
orous scientific honesty.” Dr. Gulick’s
address will be published in the Janu:
ary 1954 issue of RECREATION. .

At the Wednesday morning meeting,
John Turner, superintendent of recrea-
tion, St. Louis, and Robert Black, rec-
reation consultant, Missouri Resources
and Development Commission, extended
an official invitation to the congress to
meet in St. Louis next. year. This morn-
ing session 011 “Planning for Recreation

in the Modern City,” chaired by Miss

Susan Lee, was one of the most out-
standing of the congress, and was ad-
dressed by three of the nation’s top
planning experts: Hugh R. Pomeroy,
director of Westchester County, New
York, Planning Commission; Henry
Fagin, planning director, Regional Plan
Association, Incorporated, New York
City; and John T. Howard, associate
professor of city planning, Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology. Because

of the excellence of these talks, plans
for their publication as a series in
RECREATION are already underway.
They will later be reprinted in pamph-
let form.

Mr. Pomeroy defined planning as an
Operation which “gives direction to
forces already in motion.” Citing the

modern city as an aggregate of the
physical things that people, have done
and continue to do since its founding,
he explained that what planning seeks
to do is to “set an objective for the
things being done so that the resultant
city serves best the social welfare of
its inhabitants.” This dynamic concept,
in which planning provides a pattern
for the location, character, form and
timing of the use of public lands, must
permeate the entire operations of gov-
ernment, according to Mr. Pomeroy,
and must include the entire physical
community—public and private—as
well.

Mr. Fagin emphasized the distinction
between carrying out these objectives
and the making of the larger policy de-
cisions on which they must be based,
pointing out that the latter should be
made with public participation because
they are “more important than deciding
which facilities to build where.”

The importance and effectiveness of
citizen participation in planning at all
levels was also emphasized by Mr.
Howard, who outlined for delegates the
how-it’s-done deveIOpment of planning
operations.

The last general session on Friday
morning, chaired by Mr. Mallery, was
devoted to “\Vhat Has Been Significant
About the Philadelphia Recreation Con-
gress?” Dr. Paul Douglass, speaking
from the point of view of the volunteer
pointed up the new patterns of life that
are developing as a result of more
leisure time, more economic income,
the provision for free-time activities.
Briefly, these patterns are: habits of
participation; a strengthening of the
home through family recreation; a
deepening of a sense of community; a
new interest in cultural and creative ac-

400

tivities. Mrs. George Gorton spoke for
other board members in an excellent
and hard-hitting speech that did not
pull its punches.

Mr. Robert W. Crawford said that
the recreation pattern in America is
adjusting to a changed population
structure, and that the recreation
profession has the task of meeting de-
mands for service which will require
vast new facilities, more and better
qualified personnel, and more standard-
ized conditions of professional employ-
ment. He stressed the immeasurable
values of the congress for those who
attend and for the city in which it is
held.

Daytime Sessions

The regular discussion sessions ran
from 9:15 to 10:45 AM. and sometimes
12:30, and from 2:30 to 4:00 in the
afternoon, with some few exceptions.
To report the content of these fifty-
seven meetings here is impossible, but
a summary of each, in addition to thc
evening addresses, will be included in
the Congress Proceedings* which may
be available by the time this magazine
reaches you.

“We are deeplyr gratified with

ceived from the more than 500
persons with assigned tasks who
participated in the Philadelphia

sponse and the work of thc vari-

Other Activities

Under “other” we include the socia
activities and the fun, although th:
latter actually permeated the entin
congress. Recreation leaders are no
like the “shoemaker’s son who alway
goes barefoot,” and—in their Spar.
time—have a way of seizing upon an}
recreation Opportunity that rears it
head. Planned social events started of
with the NRA tea on Monday which
without a receiving line, was more in
formal than usual.

Each evening, after the general ses
sion, some form of social activity wa
offered. Here, even while relaxing bj
enjoying themselves, delegates picket
up leadership pointers and progran
ideas to take home. In such affairs
mixers, square and folk dancing pre
dominated, with the interesting demon
stration of Estonian dances by young
peOple from International House 01
Tuesday, a real orchestra playing fo
the do-si-doers on Wednesday nigh
and, of course, ballroom dancing, again
with an orchestra, on Thursday nigh
after the banquet. All of these evening:
ended with voluntary and informa
singing around the piano. Evening
meetings throughout the week provider
their share of the singing too, whil:
waiting for the crowd to assemble ever}
night.

On Wednesday afternoon, instead 0
the regular meetings, two tours tool
off into the sunshine of a beautiful daj
——the “Historical Tour” taking in som.
of the interesting sights related to th.
birth of our national independence ant
ending with refreshments served by th:
Smith Memorial Playgrounds at the las
st0p, in Fairlnont Park; and the “Rec
reation Tour” which introduced dele
gates to recreation facilities of the city
Some of the more diligent souls stayet
behind, however, to hold more con
ferences, special meetings or to attenc
the craft classes at the Baltimore craf
exhibit. Special tours of golden-agu
clubs and of hospitals were also fea
tures of congress week.

A period was set aside 011 Tuesday
afternoon, for the showing of moti01

picture films brought by delegates.

All-Day Conferences

The all-day conferences on Monday
were so productive of interesting results
that brief digests of these meetings are
given here. More complete information
will be included in the Congress Pro-
ceedings.*

Administrative Problems. These three
meetings were heavily attended. From
the tackled there
emerged a concern for the c00peration
of public and private agencies in the
local community, for as communities

many problems

grow there is a tendency toward an
overlapping of agency services. A great
part of the discussions, too, had to do
with swimming pools and revealed the
interesting information that one in
every four communities represented
was planning the construction of a new
pool, of has completed a pool during
the past year. Several executives indi-
cated that they are operating school-
owned pools after school hours and
during the summer.

Stimulating and enlightening also
was the extensive discussion of the rela-
tion of full-time and part-time recrea-
tion staffs to the effectiveness of the
recreation program, the problems in-
volved in evaluating recreation leader-
ship and program services.

After these meetings were over it was
felt that there could have been more
participation on the part of new, young
executives, many of whom attended. It
is to be hoped that, another year, they
will come forward and toss in more of
their own good ideas. There is some
talk of a special meeting of their own,
with a panel of old-timers for a stump-
the-expert session. All in favor say

Recreation in Hospitals. These meet-
ings were also well attended, partici-
pation was excellent. The first, chaired
by Mrs. Elizabeth K. Couch, recreation
supervisor of the Brooklyn State Hos-
pital, included an excellent address by
Dr. Paul Haun, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the Bowman Gray School
of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North
Carolina. He stated that the recreation
worker is not a therapist and therefore
has neither diagnostic nor treatment

powers. Therapy has to do with the
medical side of the patient’s treatment;
but certainly no wise physician would
minimize the part which a healthy spirit
can contribute to the development of
a healthy body. A heated discussion
followed, based upon two questions:
whether or not the work of the recrea-
tionist is therapeutic and should be so
considered; and how the recreation
worker may attain greater status in a

pose by Mrs. Beatrice Hill, who h.
been successful in introducing recre
tion to New York City hospitals. Tl

his usefulness and opportunity for
service.

The second meeting, chaired by
Rosemary Ward, recreation supervisor,
American Red Cross, U. S. Naval Hos-
pital, Portsmouth, Virginia, was con-
cerned with the value and place of a
recreation program in terms of the
long-term and the carry-over program,
and with evaluation of program; while
the first meeting in the afternoon dealt
with the role of recreatiOn in rehabili-
tafion, and was chaired by Maurice
duPont Lee, NRA sponsor in Wilming-
ton and president of the Wilmington
Park Commission. It was addressed by

Dr. George C. Deaver’of New York
University’s Institute of Physical Medi-

1*cine and Rehabilitation, who stressed

the values of using rhythmic, creative
and cultural activities with patients. He
said that iegreation workers need to
meet the social and mental nceds of
patients.

The high point of the day was
reached, however, with the thrilling
panel presentation of the recreation
program at the Goldwater Memorial
Hospital for Chronic Diseases, of New
York, put on by a group of the patients
themselves. The patients were brought

this meeting stressed the importance
of leadership, and was chaired by F red-
erick M. Warburg of NBA board of di-
rectors. The group held that first it is
important to work out a philosophy of
recreation to include everybody in the
community. No community is so small
that it does not have potential leaders.
These should be discovered and used.
It was stressed that willing “fellowship”
creates leadership. A good leader is
similar to a catalyst in chemistry—by
using his ability and techniques he
changes the attitude and outlook of the
group. He is interested in getting the
job accomplished rather than in taking
the credit for doing it himself.

The third panel, chaired by Earl H.
Regnier of the University of Illinois,
also stressed the importance of first
determining what the local youth need
and want. It was decided that all young
people want social contacts, competitive
fun, and to play the game according
to the established rules. When left on
their own, participation lags. Skillful
guidance is a necessity. It was also
brought out that there is a great need
for the return of recreation to the home.
The last half of this session was con-
ducted in the form of a workshop, with
each of four sections presenting suc-

cessful program ideas.

Motivation of Church Recreation. The
Reverend Paul Moore, Jr., who is first
vice-president of NBA, chaired the first
two of these meetings, Dr. William W.
Reeder of Cornell University, the third.
Unfortunately, many delegates came
too late to hear Mr. Moore’s pertinent
opening remarks at the first session or
the points developed by Father W. T.
Couch of Baltimore in his opening ad-
dress. Mr. Moore pointed out that “rec-
reation should be recognized as a true
expression of life, of fellowship and of
joy, and should not be used simply as
a ‘baited hook’ to entice people into
church pews.” Father Couch concurred
with this and elaborated upon the state-
ments that: (1) Motivation for recrea-
tion in the church is found in the scrip-
tures. The love of God must be the
primary motivation for recreation ac-
tivities. This is threefold—love of God,
love of neighbor, and love of self. (2)
All recreation activity must be co-
creative with God. (3) The religious im-
pulse must overflow into recreation. His
address was followed by discussion.

The second session was a panel meet-
ing, with open discussion of the subject
of church recreation programs for all
ages. Many areas in recreation have
long been considered the responsibility
of the church, but some groups have not
been included, such as older adults, the
very young, and the “silver-age” adults.
To reach all who need assistance is thc
responsibility of the church. In plan-
ning recreation programs, the church
should: (a) use existing organizations
within the church; (b) provide oppor-
tunities for fellowship, and for partici-

‘pation by all ages; (c) provide oppor-

tunities for projects to be community-
wide and to cross denomination lines;
and (d) develop family Unity.

The last session, chaired by Dr. Wil-
liam W. Reeder of Cornell University,
dealt with leadership for church recrea-
tion and covered such questions as:
How may volunteer leaders be found?
How may professional leaders bc found
and trained? How may capable, trained’
people be recruited? How may a pro-
gram of leadership training be started?
Where social dancing is not allowed,
what substitutes are useful? How may
undesirable leaders be eliminated from
positions which they hold?

From an Address by Mrs. Howard Braucher,
National Recreation Congress, Philadelphia.

NE NEED not be a seer nor a prophet
0 to know that the recreation move-
ment in the United States is a going con-
cern. The sails are filled, the streamers
waving. That over a thousand pe0ple
have gathered in Philadelphia in the
year 1953 to spend a week deliberating
on problems of recreation for all the
people, when interests and activities of
every kind beat upon us, all indicates
that here we have something that has
claimed us for its own. We are busy
pe0p1e. We see our goals clearly—and
we are moving toward them.

I love recreation congresses—and
have been to many since that spring day
in Pittsburgh in 1909 when I, the super-
visor of dramatics for the Pittsburgh
Playground Association, poured out my

heart before the Congress on the spirit;

ual values of storytelling. There was a
young man in the audience, newly ap-
pointed executive of the then Play-
ground Association of America, who

also was thrilled by the spiritual values
of storytelling—and out of our shared
beliefs grew our forty years of shared

dedication to the recreation movement
in America.

We were a young organization in
1909—only three years old. New York,
Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, and a few
other communities had achieved some
kind of year-round work. We were aw-
fully excited about the lighted school-
house, a glorious new idea. We talked
a lot about slums and crowded streets.
I don’t believe we had envisioned the
vast meaning of recreation for all peo-
ple. I remember some of us Pittsburgh
workers snickering softly when a
speaker suggested horseback riding for
girls. We wondered how she supposed
the little waifs we dealt with would ever
even see a riding horse! That, in 1950,
the National Recreation Association
Yearbook would report 58,029 paid
workers in 1,710 cities and almost as
many volunteers as paid workers would
have seemed beyond our wildest
dreams. Oh, yes, the work has grown,
has developed! Think of the activities
reported—music in all its forms, drama
from Mother Goose to T. S. Eliot, with

But how blessed, how past belief

The Spirit of Youth and the City

reels writes of a baseball game:

"The enormous crowd of cheering
ys and men [nowadays she wouldn’t
lit women and girls] are talkative and
pdnatured, full of the holiday spirit,
(I absolutely released from the grind
life. They are lifted out of their in-
.ridual affairs and so fused together
it a man cannot tell whether it is his
r11 shout or another’s that fills the
rs; whether it is his own coat or an-
ler’s that he is wildly waving to cele-
atc a victory. He does not call the
'anger who sits next to him his
'othcr’ but he unconsciously em-
nces him in an overwhelming out-
rst of kindly feeling when the favorite
lyer makes a home run. Does not this
ntain a suggestion of the undoubted
wer of public recreation to bring to-
ther all classes of a community in the
)(lern city unhappily so full of devices
r keeping men apart?”
Hiss Addams out of her wide experi-
ce with all kinds of peeple and her
lat loving heart early recognized the
ep springs of human need and frus-
lliOll, out of which rose the yearning
r the joy and satisfaction which rec-
Ition can give. In another connection
B says:
“We may cultivate this most precious
ssession, or we may disregard it. We
1y listen to the young voices rising
Iar above the roar of industrialism
d the prudent councils of commerce,
we may become hypnotized by the
w emphasis placed upon wealth and
user, and forget the supremacy of
iritual forces in men’s affairs.”
And later in the book she makes that
lanI‘tal appeal for the boys and girls
the city:
“We may either smother the divine
e of youth or we may feed it. We
1y either stand stupidly staring as it
1ks into a murky fire of crime and
res into the intermittent blaze of folly
we may tend it into a lambent flame
th power to make clean and bright
Ir dingy city streets.”

We have also in our heritage Joseph

I-CEMBER 1953

Lee’s penetrating vision of the meaning
of play. I could quote from almost
any page:

“Play is the word that best covers the
things which man was wound up to do,
in the doing of which he was most him-
self. It is by being citizen, nurturer,
poet, creator, scientist, by actively fill-
ing out the ideal waiting for him that a
man can win or save his life.”

Richard Cabot in, 1915 analyzing
work, love and play as the very stuff out
of which life is made declared:

“By these three principles we are
helped to grow up and saved from grow-
ing old. . . . Out of the dazzle and welter
of modern civilization which offers a
hundred quack remedies for every ill of
the soul, work, play and love emerge as
the permanent sources of helpfulness.”

In the early days George E. Johnson,
educator and'first superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Playground Association,
strengthened our faith and understand-

ing in Why Teach a Child to Play:

“No case ever appeared in the Pitts-
burgh juvenile court or in any other
juvenile court in which the act com-
mitted was not prompted wholly or in
part by some impulse which, under

other relations and other associations,
could be both right and desirable. . . .

“Every year our great rivers, over-
flowing their banks, endanger life and
damage property. No one ever wishes
that the rivers could be removed, for if
they were Pittsburgh would be dead.
One only wishes that pr0per channels
could be provided. The immemorial
streams of heredity in our boys and
girls often break over the barriers of
law and convention. We do not wish
these streams could be removed, for if
they were the boys and girls would be
dead. We can only wish that pr0per
channels be provided. . . .

“It seems pitiful that the qualities
that have led the race upward and have
made it possible for it to be what it is
today should be the qualities that lead
many boys to their destruction. . . .

“Who is a bad boy? He is one in
whom the streams of heredity run deep
and strong, in whom the virtues of his
ancestors are expressed in tireless en—
ergy. The good boy is like him, only he
has had a fair chance. . . .

“Species and races have advanced

proportionately as they have played.
Nay—as they have taught play!”

It is as though these early leaders had
said in the words of the parable, “Give
me a light that I may tread safely into
the Unknown,” and had received the
great admonition: “Go out into the

darkness and put your hand into the
hand of God. That shall be for you bet-

ter than a light and safer than a known
way.”

I am trying to say that this movement
has always had a spiritual basis, that
from the organization of the National
Recreation Association in 1906 we have
had great prophets and we have been
brought up to believe that our service
has a profound meaning for the de-
veIOpment of the individual and the
growth of the democracy.

With the mounting complexities of
modern life and the development of psy-
chology to meet the stresses, recreation
has been increasingly recognized as
having the utmost therapeutic value. I
have collected countless bits of evidence
of this recognition. Rollo May in Man’s
Search for Himself says that emptiness
is the chief problem of peeple in the
middle of the twentieth century.

“We are the hollow peOple who indio
vidually compulsively conform to a col-
lective emptiness which leaves us lone-

 

ly, anxious and bereft of meaning. Man
must be rescued from a sense of per-
sonal isolation and general meaning-
lessness to renew his awareness of him-
self as a person of dignity and worth.”
And right on top of the statement of the
problem we get such answers as the re—
port of community activities in New

York’s Hillside Homes in which Miss
Louise Blackham says:

“Here where community leadership
is encouraged, where each resident has
an Opportunity of fitting himself into a
useful spot in the project, personalities

405

seem to round out and become full.
People are happier because their inferi-
ority feelings and their different kinds
of phobias are sublimated into channels
that are responsibilities. The ensuing
sense of importance gives each a place
in his world.”

Our modern psychology has taken us
through the study of frustration and
suppressed desires and arrived at the
conclusion that a sense of well-being is
based upon “good mental and physical
health, a sense of belonging to a group,
the comfort of knowing one is loved,
the satisfaction of accomplishing some-
thing worth while, the stimulus that
comes from new experiences and the joy
of serving.” Does not recreation pro-

mote every one of these ohjectives?
Good mental health—can anyone
deny that having something to think
about, something to look forward to,
variation of routine, forgetfulness of
self in a game or a hobby, is of pri-
mary value in building mental health?

Good physical health—Lthat’s right up
our alley! “Play is laughing while you
run,” said a child. One of our thinkers
once said, “There’s no known germ that
can survive the. sunshine on the laugh-
ing face of a child at play.” Some one
told me recently of a group of people,
all past sixty, whose bodies had been
completely rejuvenated under the in-
pired leadership of a teacher of rhyth-
mical expression. Intellectuals who had
scorned physical exercise all their lives
now found delight and exaltation in
Old muscles and bones
ceased to creak and crack, and every-

movement.

body said, “Why you look ten years
younger!”

A sense of belonging—from the in-
fant who delights in this little pig went
to market to the eighty-year-old citizen
stopping in the middle of the street to
shake hands with the traffic cop and tell
him he’s a member of the city council——-
we all want to belong; and on the play-
ground and in the recreation center peo-
ple do belong—sometimes in a very ten-
tative fashion-—sometimes in an all-out,
taking-over-the-management fa sh i o 11!
But through play that fundamental
longing can be satisfied.

The comfort of knowing one is loved
—here we pause a moment. An English
teacher, alert to errors in grammar,

406

wrote on the blackboard, “I didn’t have
no fun over the week-end!” and asked
the class, “What can 1 do about that?”
Answer came promptly from the back
seat, “Get a feller.” Well, that’s the
nicest way to be loved. But there are
all degrees. Note how basic in the think-
ing of Jane Addams, George E. John-
son, and Joseph Lee is the love and un-
derstanding of the individual. Friends
are made, reSpect engendered, person-
ality blooms in the hright rays of play-
time.

The satisfaction of accomplishing
something worth while—I suppose in
the main we associate that objective
with work, but the field of accomplish-
ment is wide. Happiness in work de-
pends first of all on the kind of person
who goes to work. We can’t all, in these
days of assembly lines, just love our
jobs and wonder privately whether it’s
right to take money for having so much
fun. Maybe achieving complete relax-
ation could be the ultimate satisfaction.
Make up your mind what you want and
then go toward it. I’d like to make the
best cherry tarts in Greater New York.
I don’t do so well as yet, but each time
I try I have a sense of achievement, and
the polite praises of my friends are
music to my ears. I seem to find a con-
genial spirit in Dorothy Thompson who
wrote recently of the delight in achieve-
ment outside one’s field. “Praise me for

“The American way of life on the
surface may sometimes have seemed to
wander up and down and around, but
underneath it has always, on the long
haul, moved toward beauty, music,
sport, richness in living. Church spires,
school bells, art galleries, parks, play-
grounds, swimming holes, libraries,
choruses, symphonies; art and living——
the art of living—have always been a
very real part of the dream in times of
famine, in times of flood, in war and
pestilence, in times of prosperity and
abundance.

“Nothing that has come out of Ameri-
ca is more characteristic of her, ex-
presses more truly her inner spirit, than
her national recreation movement.”*

Dorothy Canfield has said, “We can

conceive of no finer use of the divine
instinct to shape into comely form what
it finds in human existence than to make
of the relationship between human be-
ings something enduring, stable and

IUATHIN 0F NEW INDUSTRIES

The important role which community
'rcation plays in influencing the loca-
p of new industries is clearly pointed
t in a booklet, entitled Local Govern-
!nt Services and Industrial DeveIOp-
Int in the Southeast, issued coopera-
Iely by the Tennessee Valley Author-
r and seven state universities early
is year. It contains quotations from
Hustrial leaders, and from various
lblications, stressing the importance
recreation as one of the factors that
tract industry to a community. It
tes a report issued after an interview
.th two hundred Michigan manufact-
ers as follows: “The fact that Michi-
Ln is a pleasant state in which to live
ould be emphasized. Its excellent rec-
'alion facilities, its climate, its schools
Id the pleasant suburbs of its towns
present important considerations for
my industrialists.”

Recreation is one of several commu-

pCEMBER 1953

nity services which are discussed in
some detail, although it is pointed out
that the total impact of community fa-
cilities has greater meaning to industry
than can possibly be revealed by their
separate elements. It states:

“Adequate public recreational facili-
ties such as parks, playgrounds, and
swimming pools are sometimes given
more emphasis than schools by indus-
trial personnel managers. The role of
recreation as a locational factor was il-
lustrated dramatically in the case of one
Kentucky city which lost a very attrac-
tive potential industry mainly because
it lacked a decent park system and had
virtually no public recreation program.
Having learned its lesson, the city pre-
pared and executed a long-range recre-
ational plan, and a few years later
secured one of the largest new factories
in the Southeast because this enterprise

religion and my politics. I hope 1 do.
I know I mix my religion and my recre-
ation, for I see our movement building
a richer, lovelier more humane civiliza-
tion. We’ve gone almost as far as we
can in building refrigerators and Cadil-
lacs. Now we are about to concentrate
on building human beings. And no man
can see the end! Edwin Markham
grieved over the early industrial man as

workers, a people strong and free and
eager. Let us extend ourselves. Let.us

with a progressive recreational program
that would satisfy its employees. 0n the
other hand, one Tennessee industrialist
says: ‘I think people in general place
too much emphasis on recreation. I do
not consider recreation facilities at all.
More work and less play is good for
workers.’ To those who hold the latter
opinion, community services generally
will have little appeal.

“The possibility of an escape to near-
by hunting and fishing preserves, as in
national parks and on TVA lakes, espe-
cially for the hard-pressed executives
and employees of a modern industry,
has in some cases been a significant con-
sideration among the industries survey-
ed. The majority of employees must
depend on local or readily accessible
parks, forests, and community centers
for outdoor recreation. If facilities for
employee recreation are not supplied by
the community, the farsighted indus-
trialist may either pass up the commu-
nity or take steps to supply such facili-
ties himself.”

originated Santa Claus Lane, with the first figure created.

I INUSUAL holiday decorations brighten Norris Avenue

(named for the late U. 5. Senator George W. Norris)

in'McCook, Nebraska. Extending for several blocks along

this avenue are some forty Christmas and winter scenes in
cut-out shapes, covered by refiective sheeting. -

There are the three wise men, a caravan of camels, a na-
_ tivity scene, and a snow-banked church on the religious side.
And there are modern interpretations of Christmas: an
eight-foot Santa Claus, a four-foot fireplace, a sleigh with
reindeer, a snowman, a girl caroler, toy drum, toy soldiers,
toy train, teddy bear, rocking horse, Christmas tree, boy in
a sleeping garment—all ready for Christmas Eve—and other
figures.

One sign delineating the stained glass window of a church
carries the familiar message: “Peace on earth; good will
toward men.”

Tagged “McCook’s Original Santa Claus Lane,” the dis-
play draws visitors from a wide area to see the first holiday
lane to be illuminated not by electricity but by a luminous
cloth. The cloth is of various colors, and glows with jewel-
like intensity when touched by automobile headlights. In
fact, it’s the same luminous material long used on road
markers and advertising posters.

But it was an imaginative laundryman, Ed Petersen, J r.,
who glimpsed the shining cloth’s_ possibilities for creating
Christmas decorations. As a member of the McCook Cham-
ber of Commerce’s Christmas Decorations Committee, Pet-
ersen dropped in to chat with his business neighbor, sign
maker W. K. Swanson. Swanson was putting the finishing
touches on a tourist cabin sign. Petersen recalls:

“The sun was shining through the window on the sign,
bringing it to life with color. I said to my friend Swanie,

‘Why couldn’t that stuff be used to create some Christm

“ ‘Oh, no. It’s just for posters,’ the busy sign-mak-
replied.”

But that night W. K. Swanson couldn’t sleep. He kc
thinking about what his friend Petersen had suggested. 5
he rolled out of bed. And he began to sketch. That night 1
completed sketching an eight-foot Santa Claus. He blOCkf
in a color chart.

Early next morning'Swanson rushed into Petersen’s lau
dry oIIice with his giant sketch.

“I was excited,” Ed Petersen recalls, “But I knew Pd [1
a heck of a time selling that marked-up sketch to a h
boiled committee. That’s what I told Swanie. He Wrin
his brow, began to do some figuring on a piece of paper,
came up with the offer to invest enough of his money

The committee ordered ten signs of Christmas-motif. And
satisfy his own creative feeling about the project, W. K.

Although Mr. Swanson studied art at the University of

0 DRAW MORE ATTENTION to park areas in Fayetteville, North
olina, recreation and parks superintendent Selwyn Orcutt has
igated the building of groups of figures to compose different
istmas scenes to be used in the parks. Each year one new scene is
ed. The scenes shown, which are made of scrap and salvage
erials and are lighted at night, are two of the three now in use in
e of the parks. With an additional one added yearly, it won’t be

before every park in Fayetteville will be decorated at Christmas-
——and without a lot of strain to the department’s budget.

EMBER 1953

The chamber of commerce has made long-range plans to
develop this lane and to tie it in with some of the more tra-
ditional types of decoration to suit those folks who like a bit
of the old-fashioned in their holiday displays.

This year a full-grown evergreen tree will be planted in
the first parkway area where Santa Claus Lane has its be-
ginning on Norris Avenue. And special wiring is being in-
stalled on individual electric light posts along the avenuc so
that additional Christmas decorations may extend on down
McCook’s main street.

Al Hein, secretary of the chamber of commerce, says:
“We’re building for permanency in our decorative plan; not
just for a flashy temporary display.”

The idea seems to appeal to many people. W. K. Swanson
has had letters of inquiry about the lane from South
America, Cuba, and other far places. And other towns have
begun to utilize McCook’s original idea for creating Christ-
mas spirit.

Since there are no copyright privileges in this field of
decorating, the three McCook men who created this first new
type of Christmas display are properly humble about their
jewel-bright lane—for true artists are generally modest.

Of this, about two hundred dollars went for insurance.

that the high rate was primarily caused by the ladder climb-

“We couldn’t just go ahead with the work, once the money

TEEN-AGERS CAN DECORATE YOUR
COMMUNITY FOR CHRISTMAS

he Oyster Bay recreation director, Mr. Ruckel, writes
National Recreation Association as follows:

"Lacking a youth center, it did not take our teen-age club
0' to find something useful to do. With “civic pride and
spirit of Christmas” in their minds, it is unbelievable
' much money the children can save the community in a
re such as our decorating project. Proof that it has
d zest to the recreation program was shown when the

Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Alice in Wonderland, and
Rudolph the Reindeer could do so. The young people took

all these parts and accepted nearly three thousand phone
calls weekly.

“Our plans, this year, call for decorating immediately
after Thanksgiving; and the club offers the following sug-
gestions to others who may wish to do the same and save
their community several thousand dollars. The money goal
should not be set too high, depending upon the size of the
community. As an average, one thousand dollars is sufficient.

1. Secure from state, county, or local government permis-
sion to decorate streets.

2. Plan the number of blocks to be decorated. This is im-
portant for insurance purposes.

3. Obtain permission from the light and telephone company.

4. Use ladders. It is best to have at least two, one for each
side of the street.

5. Insurance is a problem—especially with teen-agers.
Start investigating early, since the idea is novel and insur-
ance companies are not prepared to give you rates on this
type of undertaking. By all means have insurance.

6. Costs will vary but the items are roughly as follows for
an 3800 expenditure:

Insurance $100
Cable wire $100
Laurel $150 (we gathered ours)
Xmas lights $150-$200 ’
Pole decorations $100 (we made much of our own)
Miscellaneous r $100
Timers and extras $100
Total 35800

7. Set a goal of $600 to $700 for decorating a community
which usually spends $3,000 at ’Xmas. Ours cost less than
$400, but we had the advantage of being able to gather
laurel from local estates. This was $150 saved.”

IIURCHES have a program of religious education
@ through which they try to nurture the mind of the

pupil toward a Christ-like way of living. They seem
to feel that developing the mind is enough—without consid-
ering the fact that in ‘order for the mind to develop, the
body must develop also.

Recreation is needed because a person is a whole being,
and he is not complete without recreational activities. We
can become physically, socially, and spiritually undernour-
ished without some fun and fellowship in life. Just as a
flourishing plant needs many elements to make it grow and
bear fruit, so an individual needs work, love, worship, and
play, to make him a well-rounded person.

Unfortunately, all leisure-time activities are not true rec-
reation, and for this reason the church should be much con-

cerned about what its people do in their Spare time.

The Church Needs a Recreation Program:

1. Because recreation satisfies a normal and legitimate
human want. From babyhood to old age, recreation adds
sparkle and zest to life.

2. Because recreation, when well conceived, makes abund-
ant living possible. We live according to the number, the
depth, and the richness of our interests.

3. Because recreation is necessary to relieve the tensions of
life. There must be periods of relaxation to counteract the
tremendous drains on man’s physical and emotional powers
that our present mode of living exacts. The right kind of
recreation can be just what is needed to revive jaded physi-
cal, mental, and spiritual powers.

 

MR. JOHNSON is director of recreation in the Highland
Presbyterian Church, Fayetteville, and president of the
Church Division of the North Carolina Recreation Society.

4. Because recreation has in it the possibilities for buildin;
attitudes, habits and interests that enrich moral characte
—thereby becoming a basic ally to the church. No progran
of education, secular or religious, can afford to ignore thl
eiTects of recreation on character and personality.

5. Because an intelligent and active interest in providin;
wholesome recreation will tend to refute the idea that “re
ligion is a dry creed with all the joy squeezed out.”I

6. Because training in a well-balanced program of recrea
tion will stabilize life and character at those points when
some of the severest tests of life are made. To quote L. P
Jacks, “Leisure is that part of a man’s life when the strugglq
between the white angels and the black for the possession 0
his soul goes on with the greatest intensity.” The churcl
has a responsibility here that it cannot ignore. The churcl
that sends its people out into social and business life to con
form to the patterns they find there is doing neither then
nor the cause of religion much good.

7. Because the Christian’s life is not well-rounded if th:
recreational aspects of his life are starved for lack of ex
pression. E. O. Harbin says, “LOpsided Christians maki
pathetic figures, and they help the Kingdom of God bu
little.”

8. Because Jesus said, “I am come that ye may have lifl
abundantly.” And the “abundant life” cannot be attainet
without the enrichment which intelligent Christian employ
ment of leisure-time can bring.

9. Because there are many people who cannot find whole
some recreation unless it is provided by an agency which i'
dominated by the motive of service. There is no agency the
can so well meet their social and recreational needs as tlu
church.

RECREATIor

F

Many of us remember the clean wholesome good-times
we used to enjoy in our church homes . . . the suppers . . .
the picnics . . . the hymn-sings. All simple things in them-
selves, but all contributing to the friendliness, the fellow-
ship, and the abundant living which are among the goals of
the church.

Churches were the community centers then, as they should
bc now. To a great number of people, the church was their
main source “of social and recreational activity. Then came

period of ever increasing commercialized diversions in the

rms of theaters, drive-ins, the radio and television, and
ell-en the motor car—-—-to mention a few—and churches came
be considered as places of worship only.

The trend now is toward the church again endeavoring to
fill the needs of the people for worship, for social affairs,
.nd for recreation. More and more the churches are recog-
Itizing that the good life includes recreation. Recreation
Iepresents fellowship of man with man; worship is fellowship
of man with God.

Today forms of church recreation are changing, but still
ivith us is the desire for fellowship; still present is the re-

onsibility of the church to help its members find the satis-

ction they crave through recreation. One of the prime ob-
ctives of church leaders is to create an atmosphere of good

till, fcllowship, and a cordial relationship among the mem-
ers of the church.

What do people want when they come to use the facilities

d leadership which the church offers them in their free

me? Something educational? Something amusing? Or

mething just to pass the time?

We might also ask—what do people need in the free time

at is theirs? They need amusement—yes. They need

mething beneficial to their minds and bodies—yes. They
ced relaxation—yes. In short, they need re-creation.

A program of recreation in the church must be built on

e basic interests of people—whether social, physical, cre-

tive, mental, or simply the desire to be of service to their
llowmen. It must meet the needs of various age groups——
om the youngest child to the more advanced ages. It must
vary, including both active and passive forms of recreation
——and it must be rich in the activities that boys and girls,
men and women, can enjoy together. It must take into ac-
count thc fact that personal satisfaction comes -from per-

sonal achievement and personal participation. It must con-
sider that the high ideal of play is that those who participate
experience real joy.

You may observe a group of young people apparently
playing a game together—which they are, but in reality they
are learning to cooperate, to help each other, to be loyal, to
be tolerant, to be fair.

In this sense, we can say that character values are by-
products of play. And these by-products are most likely to
appear when the group is not consciously trying to develop
them.

Games are capable of taking individuals and welding them
into -a group—a small democratic society. When playing,
the success of the game depends upon the cooperation of
all. Each individual becomes an intimate part of the whole.

We may therefore state that the truest value to be gained
from recreational games is more than social—it is religious.
Religion is concerned with all of life. Christianity has
sought to make living more rich and beautiful. Recreation,
like every other aspect of life, should help one become posi-
tively and actively a Christian. An organized recreational
program within the church will do just that—and will do it
more completely than any other medium.

What are the Values of Church Recreation?

1. It gives boys and girls spontaneous, vigorous things to
do at ages when their need for exercise and sociability is
greatest.

2. It furnishes an opportunity for shy youngsters to get
together for a wholesome good time.

3. It makes participants of spectators.

4. It fosters a spirit of cooperation.

5. It helps develop and preserve our physical bodies.
6. It completes the educational program of the church.

7. Through all these, it brings us closer to Christ by teach-
ing a more abundant way of life.

It is to be greatly desired ihat more and more churches
will come to realize, along with Bishop William T. Manning,
that “The instinct for play is as divinely planted in human
nature as the instinct for worship. The church must not
merely tolerate clean sport and recreation, but it must give
them its glad and open blessing.”

The fate of the English Traditional Children’s Games in New Zealand,
pointing up the relation of childrcn’s play to the processes of social change.

The Migration of Games

IT MIGHT be thought that the old English traditional chil-
dren’s games would be well preserved in a country so
isolated as New Zealand.. After all, it was as late- as 1918
that the great folk song collector, Cecil Sharp, gathered
numbers of very old folk songs from the Southern Appala-
chian Mountains of the United States. And surely the South-
ern Appalachian Mountains are no less remote from England
than is New Zealand. However, although there will be no
one to deny the remoteness of New Zealand, even the casual
visitor there can quickly tell you that the traditional games
of England have not been preserved. This has occurred
because New Zealand—unlike the Appalachian Mountains—
was settled in an era when the traditional dances, songs and
games were dying out. The traditional games of England
had scarcely struck their roots in New Zealand soil when
the changing conditions of the times swept them away.

The story of the fate of English games in New Zealand,
therefore, will not be of great interest to a student of tradi-
tional games. He will not find among New Zealand children
any wealth of folk lore, any relics of ancient festival and
primitive rite. What he will find is an interesting record of
the process of social changes as they have occurred through-
out the past hundred years, and as they have been mirrored
in the shifting patterns of children’s play.

Naturally, there is little record of games in the first twenty
or thirty years of New Zealand’s history as a British pos-
session. When the New Zealand Company’s settlers arrived

during and after the 1840’s, their first concern was to make

a home and a livelihood for themselves. In this they were
helped by children. In the pioneering economy, children
were an economic asset. There was, consequently, little
spare time left for them to play. Nevertheless, being chil-
dren, of course they did play. I will let one of the old set-
tlers who lived later in the century speak for the pioneer
children. His account is a typical one.

MR. SUTTON-SMITH, Fulbright Scholar and Smith-Mundt Re-

search Fellow, after extensive research in folk games of New
Zealand, is preparing two books on. children’s games.

Brian Sutton-Smith

He says, “One of my outstanding recollections of my boy-
hood is that practically nothing was provided to help us in
our play. From our own initiative, labour and pence we had
to achieve our play in the hard way. This rule applied to
the making of such things as shanghais from forked manuka
sticks, stilts, kites, sledges, skates, hoops, building huts and
forts, and last but not least, excavating and leveling off a
piece of sloping ground on which the older boys could play
cricket. For bathing, swimming and boating, Lake Waka-
tipu provided the water. For climbing and mountaineering.
the hills surrounding Queenstown, including the Remark-
ables at 7,688 feet, gave us full scope for our energies. 0n
the same hills we engaged in rabbiting with traps, ferrets.
dogs and guns, also the shooting of wild goats. Bird nest-
ing was tame but it found its place. Horse riding was a dail)
activity in which some of us became so expert as to emulate
the circus rider standing erect on the horse’s back while i1
was in active motion.”

It is noticeable that in this account there is practically 11c
reference to traditional games. The picture is a typical one
The circumstances of pioneering existence were not pro
pitious for the maintenance of such ephemeral forms of tra
dition as games. When children began to play there were
no established village or hamlet “greens” where they could
learn their games. Their parents, generally speaking, had
neither the time nor the attitude of mind to teach them
Except in the towns, there were seldom those aggregations
of children without which formal games cannot develop or
a large scale. In any case, what children would have wanted
to play formal games when everywhere around them lay tl'lt
challenge of unexplored bush, streams and mountains, ané
the cries and murmurs of birds, animals and fish awaiting
to be trapped, gafled and shot? No, the children of Nev.
Zealand’s first thirty years were miniature frontier settlers
concerned mainly with the hunting skills, not with the graces
of traditional games. The symbol of their play life was nol
“London Bridge is burning down;” it was the Shanghai!
It is little wonder that professors theorizing about play, al
a time when children in most pioneering countries of the

RECREATION

new world were engaged in exploring, fishing and shooting,
should have imagined that children in their wild hunting
and fighting games were recapitulating the early and savage
history of mankind.

But once these early days had passed, traditional forms
were bound to re-assert themselves. In the 1870’s and ’80’s
universal education forced all children to attend five times
a week a school playing-pitch; and that pitch became a uni-
versal, secular and compulsory village green. For the first
time, the children in every district had a definite locale for
games. Brought together every day on this locale, they car-
ried on the games they had learned from parents and rela-
tires at picnics, at sports gatherings, and in the parlor. The
:period between 1870 and 1900 was in consequence the hey-
I(lay of traditional games in New Zealand.

Nevertheless, if we compare the games of the day with
those recorded in England at the same time we find that the
ariety known by New Zealand children was far less than
that known ‘by English children. Those traditional games
which were played by New Zealand children, however, were
[strikingly similar. Cames such as the Jolly Miller, Kingie
Seenie, Stagknife, and Mother, Mother, the Pot Boils Over,
’diflered very little from their English originals. Differences
which did show themselves were only of a trivial nature.
For example, the Old Lady from Botany Bay, changed in
most New Zealand games to the Old Lady from Poverty Bay.
Had children gone on playing these games in isolation from

 

their English counterparts for another fifty years perhaps
[greater changes would have developed. This, however, did
not occur. Before important differences could develop, the
Itwentieth century had arrived and with it came vast changes
in p0pular and professional attitudes toward recreation.
ln the twentieth century, organized and commercialized
recreation became a standard feature of adult life. And, at
[be same time, psychologists, educationists and social work-
ifs directed attention to the importance of children’s play.
The result was that adults, including teachers, took a new
and positive attitude toward this play and began to influence
it. Whereas once they had neglected it and left it to develop
as it would—and that was along traditional lines—now they
set out to “correct”~it and to introduCe children to the con-
temporary sporting ideals of the adult world.
Now in New Zealand, after 1905, there was only one
sporting ideal of any importance in the adult culture, and
lat was Rugby football. The successes of the All Blacks at
ugby football in Australia and England brought to New
aland a consciousness of itself such as nothing else had
ne before and nothing else has done since. Out of the mud
f a scrum, in effect, came the New Zealander’s national con-
I iousness. So much national success for such a young
country was like too much whisky for a very young baby.
Rugby football came 'to be treated with all the seriousness of
an ancient ritual drama, which is, truly enough, its closest
analogue in the Sphere of human behavior. What should
have been an ideal became an idol!
The years between 1900 and 1920 represent a transition
period in the play and games of New Ze&land children. The
l’aditional gamcs still persisted, but they were gradually

'ECEMBER 1953

replaced by the rising prestige of the major sports. After
the first world war, this process of replacement was carried

even further. Children of ten years and older now gave
themselves almost entirely to the “gladiatorial combats” of
organized sports. Yet, in the earlier days, these were the
children who had been chiefly responsible for the main-
tenance and development of traditional game forms. Little
wonder if few remnants were retained in these years by the
under-tens.

In most recent years, even these last relnnants have been
threatened (remnants such as marbles, skipping, hop-scotch
and tops). Now that many New Zealand schools have been
decapitated and the eleven- and twelve-year-olds sent off to
intermediate schools, the teachers and public have been re-
cruiting their schoolboy football and cricket teams from the
eight-, nine- and ten-year age groups. In fact there are even
some areas in which football clubs run organized sports on
Saturday mornings for six- and seven-year-olds!

The fate of the English traditional games in New Zealand,
then, is that no sooner had these games found their feet than
they were replaced by the overwhelming influence of or-
ganized sport. Indeed, it has been one of the paradoxes of
the modern world that while modern psychology and edu-
cational theory have placed such a great stress on the im-
portance in children’s development of their spontaneous
play and games, the modern schools in New Zealand have
nevertheless been gradually organizing the traditional
games, which are spontaneous games at their best, out of
existence. In fact—the traditional game, no less than the
rural school, is fast becoming a dodo of modern education.

Friendship Among Children and Youth

Friendship Among Children and Youth was founded in
1945 with the purpose of building friendship among chil-
dren and teen-agers everywhere. Projects have been created
in which the boys and girls themselves can take an active
part—such as the “World Friendship Greeting Cards” for
children who like to paint; “The Story of the Pictures on
Our Stamps” for stamp collectors; and the “World Friend-
ship Correspondence” project, through which teen-agers
with the same interests or hobbies are put into touch with
each other. All these projects serve the same purpose: to
encourage young people, through cooperation and corres-
pondence, to learn to know and understand each other better.

This summer, in Copenhagen, children from forty-two
nations exhibited paintings illustrating their beloved fairy-
tales by Hans Christian Andersen. Ten cards, made from
original paintings selected at this exhibition, which can be
used for Christmas cards or for daily notes, are now
available. A box of these ten cards, with envelopes, is $1.00;
one hundred of the same cards, with envelopes, cost $9.00.
You can order the cards or obtain further information by

Miss Santa Claus welcomes servicemen to “Christmas-
town” with smile and directory of holiday acnwttes.

HEAVILY industrialized city of forty thousand, New Bruns-
A wick, New Jersey—located a few miles south of Camp
Kilmer—until last year had always been a “poor” soldiers’
town. Since the camp was first built in 1942, most of the
soldiers and airmen were going through Kilmer either on
their way overseas or to be processed for induction or dis-
charge. Transient servicemen out “on the town” during
World War II days were living in the rush and excitement
of war. The few “bad actors” in uniform, together with an
occasional “sharp” businessman, left a bad taste in the
mouths of both civilians and servicemen.

During the past year the superintendent of recreation for
New Brunswick, Leslie A. Gordon, has worked hard to de-
ve10p a better relationship between community and post.
Gordon came to the New Brunswick position after service in
the navy as a welfare oHicer and as the civilian director of
recreation at Governor’s Island for the First Army. He
brought with him a fine understanding of the need for inte-
grating servicemen into community recreation activities as
well as know-how in dealing with community-military co-
operation.

When the National Recreation Association’s special bul-
letin of suggestions for joint community-military planning
and participation for Christmas“ arrived in the mail on the
morning of November 20, Gordon knew that he had a made-
to-order program for New Brunswick and Camp Kilmer.

He showed the bulletin to key pe0ple in the community.

His boss, Chester Paules, park and public safety director,
gave him the go-ahead signal. The publisher of the news-

paper, the oHicials of the chamber of commerce, the mayor,

the commanding general of Camp Kilmer, the recreation
commission and other important community leaders were all

At a luncheon of representatives of the chamber of com-

merce, Camp Kilmer, and local industry on December 5, Mr.
Gordon outlined what New Brunswick might do. “This is a
plan of cooperation between both the army and the civilians
and should be done in a spirit of putting a little more 01
Christ back into Christmas,” he said.

“The soldier at Camp Kilmer gets as good food as we do
on our own tables, so we can’t buy him a dinner, but we can
give the things he can’t buy—Christmas spirit, cordialit}
and friendliness.

“We are going to put big signs on the street, with om
motto, ‘Let there be no strangers here,’ and we will ask tht
merchants to include it in all their advertising.”

Brigadier General Charles F. Craig, the commanding gen
era] of Camp Kilmer told the luncheon group, “Camp Kil
mer wants to feel a part of the community. The averagc
soldier is well paid and we want no handouts for him. H:
wants friendliness and cordiality and you should treat him
as your direct representative in the army, because_ he i:
fighting for your laws and your doctrines.”

Within two weeks, Gordon, together with these civic lead
ers, the U50, and the community service advisor for Firs
Army, George Adams, had worked out the broad outline o
the kind of a Christmas celebration New Brunswick an:
Camp Kilmer would enjoy together. The special Christma
bulletin of the National Recreation Association was care
fully evaluated for ideas and suggestions, and these wer

followed with great success.

Looking to the Future

A number of the results of “Cliristmastown” were quickly

parent. Plans were immediately started for a New Bruns-
'ick-Kilmer Christmastown for 1953.

The chamber of commerce is seeking to have Congress
.)I)I‘OVC a bill authorizing New Brunswick to use a post-
hark including the words “Christmastown, U.S.A.” during
he period from December 15 to January 1.

The New Brunswick Sunday Times in its lead editorial on
anuary 4 said: “One of the popular features of the Christ-
iastown program in New Brunswick was a directory,
ublished particularly to give visiting servicemen a handy

Hsting of sport events, social events, church services and
other community activities which they might like to attend
at participate in. The directory was prepared by the staff
If the municipal recreation department.
I' “lt seems to us that regular publication of such a direc-
ry all the year around might be a fine service which the
immunity could render to servicemen from Camp Kilmer
and elsewhere. There is much that goes on in the area which
he visiting scrviceman knows nothing about. A directory
Hld help him find interesting and wholesome entertain-
lilint here.

“We understand that the recreation department has the
hilities for preparing such a directory but has not the
Elances. This might be a worthwhile endeavor for a serv-
ice club or a group of service clubs.”

'Hr. Gordon reported that the actual cash outlay by the
municipal recreation department for its promotion of

liecsmaen 1953

 

“Christmastown” was less than 3300. “But,” he added,

“next time we’re going to get started early in the fall. We’ll
need committees on every phase of the program. Time was
so short this year and there was so much detail work to do
that we had to turn down many offers of assistance.”

Plans for 1953-54 call for:

The “ham” radio program to operate in store windows.

The home hospitality program to be expanded.

A city ordinance, which is being considered, to make it
illegal to abbreviate Christmas to “Xmas” in any public
statement or display.

A continued program of friendly welcome to servicemen
twelve months out of the year. ‘

A joint Polio F and campaign for February, to include as
one of its features a boxing show staged cooperatively be-
tween Calnp Kilmer and New Brunswick’s recreation de-
partment.

Looking Back at the Publicity

Although every one involved in “Christmastown” at New
Brunswick and Camp Kilmer knew that they had a pretty
wonderful program, none of them were quite prepared for
the deluge of publicity it received. The New York Times
and the New York Herald Tribune carried complete stories
on the program events. Tele-News and NBTV had camera
crews there on December 15 and opening ceremonies were
televised across the country. Yank Magazine, Army Times,
and a number of camp papers across the country carried the
story. i

The New York Herald Tribune editorially complimented
New Brunswick on its Christmas spirit. It said in part:

“If the epidemic of benevolence that has recently engulfed
the City of New Brunswick should spread, the State of New
Jersey would have a holiday to remember this year. It seems
the city could not afford to entertain the Camp Kilmer
soldiers in the fashion appropriate to Christmas and made
their embarrassment known to the good burghers at large.
As a result New Brunswick has outdone itself, every con-
ceivable agency has mustered its resources to give the boys
a good time, city and camp have emerged temporarily into a
single community, and the name given to it, also tempora-
rily, is Christmastown, U.S.A. ,

“ ‘Let there be no strangers here’ is the splendid motto
adopted by the city for the occasion. It should be pro-
claimed far beyond the banks of the Raritan, and it need not
be forgotten, for that matter, when the holidays are past.”

Recreation in a State Mental Hospital.

OSAWATOMIE

 

BERT was what the psychologists call

asocial. He was a psychotic patient
at the Osawatomie, Kansas, State Hos-
pital. He was there because the word
“sociability,” meant nothing to him. He
would sit quietly bothering no one; that
was the trouble. He didn’t care whether
he knew anyone or not.

All this was before he was encouraged
to work on the hospital newSpaper.
Here, in this simple maneuver of pro-
viding a patient with a type of recrea-
tion fitted to his needs, Bert found that
working with other patients was fun,
and he accomplished something. He re-
gained confidence in himself, renewed
typing skills, and is now trying to es-
tablish himself on the outside.
ently in the process of finishing a busi-

Pres-

ness course, while maintaining a part-
.time position as a clerk-stenographer,
this changed man has been promised a
full-time position when his schooling is
completed.

final result. I have that urge again to
tell the story of our h05pital. I

recreation as part of treatment. During

the past few years, this hospital has
come forward as one of the leading
state mental institutions in hospital rec-
reation. It has been a wonderful ex-
perience to play a part in its develop-
ment, to see the progress of the patients
because of this program, and to see the
way in which community organizations,
such as the excellent Gray Ladies of the
Red Cross, have c00perated in the ef-
fort to make the community a part of
the hospital and the patients a part of
the community.

In September 1950, when I came to
Osawatomie as the recreation director,
one of the first things I did was to make
arrangements with the Red Cross for its
help in my new job.

In our program, every activity is
carefully planned with an objective in
mind and is built on physiological, so-
ciological and psychological criteria.
The following activities have been set
forth and continued: patients’ canteen,
folk dancing, hobbies,‘glee club, report-
ing and newspaper work, groups of four
hundred patients in social dancing,
bingo, amateur shows, movies and ath-
letics. To fill the needs of non-ambu-
latory patients, some 161nm movies are
brought directly to the wards.

Seven birthday parties are given per
month for the patients—one party per
building. Each patient having a birth-
day in the current month is a guest of
honor in his own building. Another
aclivity which has added variety is a

patients’ rhythm band. Through this
it has been observed that they relea
aggressive drives and take positi
steps toward resocialization. Throu
it the asocial patient has found ag
that he can be an active part of a grou

Other activities include outside eI
tertainment for patients, such as a shm
by the United States Naval Air Static]
at Olathe, and a variety show of musi
for four hundred patients in the recreu
tion hall. Community groups are 110\
Sponsoring birthday parties, variet
shows, bingo parties and musicals.

In order to carry on this program, VI
sought the services of one hundred vo
unteers in the surrounding comn1u1l
ties. Thesc volunteers were careful
selected and screened from the staI '
point of stability and readiness to!
voluntary work with the patients. Thi
group is known as the Osawatomie Stat
HOSpital Auxiliary.

The Red Cross Gray Ladies are th
nucleus around which the men and W(
men of the community serve in helpin
the patients on their road to recover}
These volunteers assist in recreation:
therapy, in the observation of patienl
under insulin therapy, in the clothin
sh0p for used and new clothes donate
by merchants and others, in a patient:
library, in personal services to war
patients who are unable to attend e1
tertainments, in the operation of 16111!
movies, and in assisting with and plat
ning large group activities such 8
dances, folk dancing and bingo.

RECREATIO

The volunteers, before working with
he patients, or before being accepted
3y the hospital, are given a ten-hour
)rientation course. Then each volun-
eer is put on a ten-hour probationary
Jeriod in order that he may decide for
iimself whether or not he is satisfied
rith his duties and responsibilities and,
)y the same token, whether the hospital
hinks he is satisfactory for the assign-
nent. The function of the volunteer is
that of a companion to patients rather
han as a replacement of a paid worker.

Two attendants were delegated to as-
sist with evening activities. Recently,
hese attendants have been assigned full
ime to the recreation department. We

also obtained the services of an adjunc-
:ite therapist and a canteen manager.
Recreation in a mental hospital is
rery different in type from that in the
community. Hospital recreation must
be adapted to the temperament and con-
dition of the patients. With more nor-
mal individuals, recreation is but a
means of establishing a well-balanced
and meaningful life and learning how to
make use of leisure time. It would be

DECEMBER 1953

detrimental to an aggressive patient to
participate in a quiet passive activity,
such as checkers or reading. On the
other hand it would be detrimental to a
TB patient, who must remain quiet, to
participate in an active game or even
see an exciting movie. All films are
carefully screened. They should not re-
late too closely to the patients’ illnesses.
Musicals and westerns are much pre-
ferrcd by all patients.

Recreation has an outstanding part to
play in treatment of mental patients. It
is not a cure for mental illness, but one
of the ad unctive therapies which, when
added to the whole treatment program,
creates a total push to help the patient
to get himself well.

It is not the recreation department’s
function to amuse or entertain patients.
It is our function to help them get well.
The physician prescribes certain activi-
ties for each patient. The patient is ob-
served in these activities and is moti-
vated according to the treatment aim of
the prescription. The paticnt’s progress
is noted by the recreational therapist
and is reported to the physician, who
then attempts to discover if the patient
is more receptive to medication and
treatment. If he seems improved, the
program is then geared to effect a total
push toward recovery.

One patient had _never been too
friendly or cooperative in doing ordi-
nary housekeeping chores and indus-
trial work, yet he was given the respon-
sibility of operating the 16mm movie
projector for “shut in” patients. He has
since been home on a trial visit, the first
in five years as a patient. He now takes
great pleasure and pride in his work
with movies. Previously, during leisure
hours, he had sat mumbling to himself.

Another patient has been encouraged
in a project of raising chickens. When
he is ready to go home he plans to go
into this as a business. Another, who
came here as a severely regressed pa-
tient, is now being assisted to overcome
muteness and to become sociable,
through working as a clerk in the
patients’ canteen.

One patient never used his right hand
beCause of a mental block. After three
sessions in the rhythm band, he began
using it to hold his silverware at meals.

This was followed by playing volleyball.

PROGRAM

The patient is slowly coming from a
state of immobility to a state of mobility
and agility. Socialization has encour-
aged him to smile and say a few words
whereas before he had been in a stu-
porous catonic (lnute) state.

Any cost involved in this program is
justified when patients progress and
benefit. We are only practicing false
economy when we say such recreation
programs are a luxury. Even on a lim-
ited budget, much can be done to im-
prove recreation facilities.

Under careful supervision, our pa-
tients have built two play areas. We
used old boiler tubes for net posts.. We
made a ping pong table from an old
pool table and painted ward floors for
shuffle board. The patients’ canteen was
painted and repaired by the patients
themselves.

Many organizations have donated
prizes for bingo, refreshments and mu-
sic for our parties and dances. One or-
ganization contributed a juke box. Oth-
er organizations and individuals have
given us books, games, magazines, play-
ing cards—and twenty-five chickens for
the chicken project.

The 16mm movies are operated at a
film cost of ten dollars and entertain a
thousand patients per week--—-which
amounts to one cent per patient. Free
films are also shown. The major film,
shown once per week, is enjoyed by
around four hundred patients at a cost
of only three-and-three-quarter-cents
per person.

If we can erase or release many of
our fears and feelings of guilt through
the things we like to do (recreation) be-
cause we like to do them, then we can
add to the security of our mental health.
With mentally ill individuals our recre-
ation program attempts to teach, and
move them toward, interest in those
leisure-time activities which serve as a
diversion while in the hospital, and as
a rehabilitative measure after their re-
lease from the hospital. .

We are trying here, with all the re-
sources available, and with the wonder-
ful c00peration of community groups,
to help Osawatomie patients to renew
their lives. We feel an indefi nable pride
every time we see the gates of the world
open for one of them and the gates of
the hospital plose behind him.

DECEMBER 1953

 

 

SINCE JANUARY 1951, the Newark,
New Jersey, Board of Education
has presented “Report to Parents,”.a
series of sustaining, non-commercial
programs, featuring pupils and class-
room teachers in their normal school-
room environment, as well as all the
other services provided by the board of
education. The recreation department,
as an integral part of the school system,
has participated in nine such telecasts.

The board of education, through its
department of radio and television,

‘0perates a 200,000 watt FM radio sta- .

tion (WBGO 88.3) and produces the
half-hour program weekly, on Wednes-
day afternoons from one to one-thirty,
in c00peration with television station
WATV (Channel 13), Newark’s local,
independent television station. If the
audio content of the program is of suf-
ficiently good radio content, the tele-
casts are re-broadcast over WBGO.

From its participation, the recreation
department has gained some “video
know-how” concerning the various
phases of recreation activities success-
ful on television and the best ways to
produce them.

The planning of the program is three-

fold in Newark. Station WATV donates

its physical facilities, its time, its em-
ployees and technical advice on the
actual staging of the production. The
department of radio and television, for-
merly a part of the department of libra-
ries, visual aids and radio, acts as a
liaison between the participating de-
partment and the television station. It
is, in reality, the producer of the pro-
gram, providing additional technical
advice, scripts, floor plans, announcers
and publicity, as well as standing by
with advice and suggestions from the
conception of the program until the
final closing announcement of the tele-
cast. The recreation department plans
and provides the actual content of the
program, including the phi1050phy of
the recreation program in the city, the

theme and purpose of each individual _

program, the participants and the ma-
terials to be shown. It also provides the
sweat, nerves and tears!

During the last two and one-half
years, the following recreation depart-
ment programs have been presented:
Summer Preview, June 25, 1952—High-
lights of the planned summer recreation
program.

Food for Fun, July 16, 1952—Games

From these programs we have learnet
the following “Do’s” and “Dont’s” am
offer them as suggestions and as a guidu
to anyone contemplating a recreati01
program telecast.

 

1. Keep the program simple. Each tele
cast should dcal, preferably, with one
central idea. This central idea must be
stated and repeated as well as demon

strated.

 

"‘ Script of this telecast is reproduced or
the next page of this article.

2. Limit the number of people in the
:lIow to as few as possible to present
rour point successfully. We endeavor
0 keep this number under ten. To keep
(our picture uncluttered, request your

)articipants to dress as simply as pos- ‘

rible.

. Keep the arrangement of the set and
e movements within the set as simple
possible. If this advice is followed,
video picture will be less crowded

d the audio pickup will be more clear.

Prepare visual materials to be pre-
hntcd, such as charts or pictures, in a
IIree-to-four ratio—three-quarters as
'gh as they are wide (as is the tele-
ision screen)—regardless of their size,
ut the larger, the better. Cray paper
‘ preferred as background mounting

r these materials. Such materials
would. be checked by the art depart-

[ant of the individual television station.

Demonstrate rather than describe.
[how your story, don’t tell it. You can-
not show your whole Little League, but
pou can demonstrate an individual skill
buch as pitching or catching. ‘Vhen
HIowing skills involving dexterity and
peed, like jackstones or hopscotch, re-

eat each play several times and eXplain

h play, as the action is too fast for

c audience to follow.

Select the best possible program
rsonnel. Do not use television par-
°ipati0n as a reward or as an award.
our aim is to present your recreation
rogram in the best light. Program per-
nnel should be selected on the basis of
eir ability to enhance the effective-
rIess of the telecast and not because of
any special position they may hold.
ey should be intelligent, quick think-

i g and have a facility for speaking.
7. Let the teacher do all the‘explaining
and instructing. Teaching is his job,

furthermore, his voice carries better
than a child’s.

8. To insure the spontaneity and nat-
uralness of a good telecast, do not have
a “prepared script.” The teacher should
know exactly what he plans to do every
single minute. This does not apply to
thc children. Some basic knowledge of
their part in the telecast is essential;
however, to keep them alert and to be
natural they must not anticipate. Sur-

prise the children at times, but never

surprise your television director, or you
may find yourself “out of the picture!”
We have found that the younger the
child, the more natural and “unre-
hearsed” looking the show is. Older
children and teen-agers tend to freeze
up before the camera if the program is
too “set.”

9. Use “give-aways” when possible. A
“give-away” is simply an offer to send
additional information concerning the

program, upon request, free, to the

viewer. Through this procedure, some
idea of the type of audience and the
size of the audience may be learned. It
also helps you to discover which of your
programs has the most “audience ap-
peal.”

Can recreation be good television?
Yes, definitely. There are so many in-
teresting phases, but remember, use one
facet of one phase for one program.
Furthermore, the recreation program
lends itself to demonstration. It’s activ-

\

ities are interesting, and more impor
tant, they are active. Never forget tha
a good recreation television prograr
has audience appeal, because childre
can visualize themselves participatin

' in the activity, and parents can see th

carry-ovcr value of the activity an
adapt it to their own homes.

Community recreation now has witl
in its grasp this new medium for moder
publicity. Let us use it regularly b1
with technical skill!

 

Holiday
Games

 

Cranberry Toss

This relay requires a hatpin and a box or dish for each team, an
five cranberries for each player.

Each team lines up, one player behind the other, and the first play:
takes the hatpin and stands about fifteen feet in front of, and facin;
the second player on his team. The second player throws his cranbe
ries, one at a time, to the first player who tries to spear them, in High
with the hat pin. Those berries impaled on the pin are put in the be
or dish and count as points for the team. The second player then D
places the first, who goes to the end of the line. The third play!
throws his berries to the second player, and so on, until each one 112
had a chance to be both a thrower and a spearer (first player throws1
last player) . Team with most berries in its box wins.

Song Titles

Give each team several pages from a magazine or neWSpaper, a pl6(
of plain paper, and a roll of transparent tape or paste. Players cut 01
words from the printed pages to makeisong titles and mount them c
the plain paper. The team which completes the longest list of titles i

the given time wins.

Holiday Hat Contest

On a large table, place wrapping paper from which to make, basic
hat forms and all sorts of odds and ends of tree decorations, Christmas
cards and seals, colored paper, and so on. Allow thirty minutes work-
ing time and let participants choose their materials, design and make

their hats.

Participants may parade their hats for the judging, or place them
around the room (tall fruit juice cans serve as good bases on which

to display them) .

Christmas Quizzes

Christmas symbols, personalities, songs, and stories offer endless

possibilities for quizzes—and any good Christmas book can serve as
the source material for the preparation of these quizzes. Samples of
questions which could be used are: (1) In what country would you
be if you were visited during the holidays .by (a) Befana? Italy
(b) Jule-nissen? Denmark (c) Kriss Kringle? Germany (d) St. Basil?
Greece. (2) From what songs are the following lines taken: (a) Glory
to the newborn King? Hark, the Herald Angels Sing (b) Brightly
shown the moon that night? Good King W enceslas (c) The stars in the
sky looked down where He lay? Luther’s Cradle H ymn. (3) In what

stories or poems do the following characters'appear: (a) Bob Cratchit?

Dickens’ Christmas Carol (b) Mama in her kerchief? A Visit from

Louisiana State Capitol,

gram, in array of lights.

 

Christmas is a time of good will, cheer and peace to all
en. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, truly observes this season
ith the same spirit, in what is known as the Annual Com-
unity Christmas Festival. Without a doubt this is our best
'ogram of the year, not because of its Christmas music or
e large ‘audience that attends, but because every important
gency in this city of 160,000 has an important part in the
'oject.

It has been jointly sponsored by the Inter-Civic Club
)uncil, Executive Department, Division of Building and
rounds, State of Louisiana, and the Recreation and Park

)mmission of East Baton Rouge Parish. In addition to

these sponsors the state university, the public schools, the
Catholic and Protestant churches, and industrial groups
have participated.

This program started back in 1945 and has been held each
year on the steps of the State Capitol, except in 1946 when
it was transferred to the House Chamber, due to inclement
weather. In its very beginning, money was collected through
the civic clubs, in donations of five to ten dollars, to cover
the cost of decorations; and this first year the fund ended
with $230. School children and civic groups were invited
to sing. More adults sang in the first festival than in any of
the succeeding ones. The program and decorations have
varied slightly from year to year, but have continued to have
different groups participating.

Each of the three sponsoring groups financed the pro-
gram, in relation to their function. The Inter-Civic Club
Council financed the printed materials, loud speaker system
and scenery materials, while the State of Louisiana pur-
chased decorations for the building and furnished electri-
cians and personnel to string the lights. The Recreation and
Park Commission furnished personnel who developed the
details of the program, constructed scenery, moved chairs
and bleachers to the capitol.

Ten thousand printed programs, which proved to be val-

425

uable aids, were given to the participants and spectators.
Four city merchants helped to pay the cost of printing the
program at thirty dollars per merchant, and in return
their names were placed on the back page. Other expenses
for materials and labor were paid directly out of the funds
of the sponsoring organizations. All purchasing for the pro-
gram, outside of the capitol decorations, was done by the
pr0gram coordinator, who in turn gave a financial report
to the Inter-Civic Club Council.

As early as the middle of September, preliminary plans
were started for the organization of the program. The Inter-
Civic Club Council elected a general chairman and vice-
chairman. Tentative plans were developed by the assistant
superintendent of the Recreation and Park Commission, who
acted as the pr0gram coordinator, and groups were selected
to perform various parts of the program, a representative
from each of these becoming a member of the Christmas
F estiyal Committee. The committee held several meetings
before the program to develop the details and approve rec-
ommendations. This is a coordinating committee and the
members are able to report back to their individual groups
on what progress is being made by other groups.

Each group has separate rehearsals of their part of the
program and no combined rehearsal is held before the night
of the pr0gram.

Several days before the program, the Recreation and Park
Commission maintenance crew starts the construction for
the stable and other scenery for a Nativity scene. The frame-
work is built with two by four’s; and pine slats, which are
acquired free from local lumber mills, are used to cover the
frame and in the construction of the walls. Hay is placed
inside the manger and on top of the stable, and a platform
is built, behindithe manger scene, on which an angel appears
during the program. Blue spots, located at the foot of the
stable, give the desired lighting effect. This stable covers
the complete front entrance of the capitol.

At this time crews from the capitol start decorating the
building which, with its thirty-four-Iloor tower design, is
ideal for this purpose. At the front of the building and above
the steps on which the program is held, a huge white cross
has been designed by lighting and darkening windows for
ten stories. Windows are frosted and the individual white
lights form a cross, one hundred and twenty feet high and
sixty feet across, which can be seen from fifteen miles away.
A huge candle has been substituted on several occasions for
variation. In 1950, an outdoor advertising company ex-
perimented with a twenty-foot luminous painted star, at the
apex of the capitol. The Baton Rouge Trade School con-
structed two ten-foot candles which were placed on the but-
tresses on each side of the steps. Also, the capitol crew
strings lights from the top of the capitol to far corners on
the first floor creating the effect of a huge Christmas tree.

The pr0gram itself, which takes place below these decora-
tions, is usually held on the Thursday night before Christ-
mas. Governors, mayors, education administrators and
others have opened the program each year by throwing on
the switch to light these beautiful decorations, and by offer-
ing a few remarks about the spirit of Christmas. A brass

426

band from one of the high schools usually plays a Christm:
selection. This group, of about twenty members, is und:
the direction of the school band director. Favorite Chris
mas carols such as “0 Come All Ye Faithful,” “It Carr
Upon a Midnight Clear,” and “Silent Night” are sung E
the entire audience, and are lead by a music professor fr01
Louisiana State University. During the community singin;
spotlights light the Nativity scene at the top of the steps. .
Catholic youth organization last year portrayed the scen
which included Mary and Joseph, the wise men, shepherd:
and angels; and 1,600 school children from twenty-two pa
ish (county) elementary schools sang four songs. Eac
school choir learned the songs at their school and the twenty
two choirs were brought together for the first time on th
night of the festival. They assembled in the basement of th
capitol by the aid of a loud-Speaker and signs. After orgal
izing in their school groups, they marched on the capitt
steps in less than twenty minutes. Nothing could give a pm
son a better feeling than to hear these 1,600 small childre
singing Christmas carols together. The music teachers hav
done an exceptional job in organizing them and teachin
the songs in the same manner so that the music was excd
lent without a previous combined rehearsal. Several weal
before the program, mimeographed song sheets were passe
out to the children.

Many of the industrial groups in the area have recreatio
programs. A male chorus from one of these firms sang tw
selections last year and two more songs were sung by
Presbyterian church choir. An outstanding soloist is calle
upon each year to sing one carol. The program is usuall
closed with everyone joining in the singing of a favorit
carol such as “Silent Night.” An announcer from one c
the five local radio stations is called in to be narrator for th
program and he writes his own script.

Pianos are placed on the steps to accompany the smalli
groups; and there are microphones before each of thu
groups and before the speakers’ stand. Spot lights focus 2|
tention upon each group as it sings.

' The contrast of colors of the participants was very stri
ing last year. The brass band wore green and gold un
forms, the church choir was dressed in rich red robes, an:
the school children donned white vesper robes.

The program lasts approximately forty minutes and late
during the evening the children can listen to their own
voices over the radio in a tape recording of the program
Much publicity is given to the program, including front pagl
coverage and spot announcements on the radio. Printer
invitations are mailed to city and state dignitaries, to schoo
principals and officials, and noted people in the community
and a special chair section is reserved for their convenience
Over four thousand people attended last year. ’

Our Christmas festival is truly a community-wide pro
gram and only the entire community can be given credit fo
its success. Its pageantry and color provide a magnificen
setting for the celebration of this, our most important, holi
day season. Church, school, government and business her:
are working together with good will, in order to put the Inos
into our community Christmas.

IN SCARSDALE, Santa Claus sets up housekeeping on De- Agencies Cooperating

cember first in an Igloo (see November RECREATION,
1ge 373) and talks to all the youngsters who can come to
sit him. But “writing to Santa” is something else again.
llildren who can’t come to see him, or were too shy to talk
I him, or who have thought of something else to ask him Functions of Cooperating Agencies
11', can write a letter—and Santa answers it! Imagine!
-real letter, written on Santa’s own paper, with his own let-
rllead in bright red—“SANTA CLAUS, NORTH POLE.”

ihat is more, it’s fun for everybody else, too. Here’s how

works :

Post oflice, chamber of commerce, women’s club, town
newspaper, local radio station, schools—private and public,
Parent-Teacher Association, recreation department.

Recreation Department—Organizes and conducts the proj-
ect; obtains stationery, stamps, and other materials needed;
takes care of publicity and coordinates the work of the co-
operating groups; makes up sample letters that the ladies
may use as a guide in answering the children.

Women’s Club—Provides a group of ladies—usually twelve
to sixteen of them—to answer letters in their own handwrit-
ing on stationery provided by the recreation department.
The letters are short, but individualized.

Post Omce—S aves all letters addressed to Santa Claus. These
are picked up by the recreation department.

Chamber of Commerce—Each merchant builds a letter box
and places it in a conspicuous place in his store. Merchants
call the attention of parents to the boxes and urge children
to write a letter to Santa: Lettcrs are sent to the recreation
department.

Newspaper and Radio—Give the project plenty of attention
———usually over a three-week period before Christmas.
Schools—Superintendent of schools approves, and princi-
pals urge teachers to interest children in writing to Santa
Claus.

Parent-Teachers Association — Helps spread the gospel
through their meetings and publicity media.

Plan of Procedure

November 1st—Make arrangements with the postmaster to
save the letters written to Santa Claus. ’

Contact the superintendent of schools to obtain approval
for teachers to urge children to write Santa.

Request the chamber of commerce to start building their
letter boxes and place them on display about December lst.
December 12th—Start picking up letters from post oflice,
and accumulate and sort them. Continue pick-ups as demand
calls for it.

December 18th—Set aside a meeting place for members of
the women’s club to meet and answer letters.
December 22nd—Last day for answering letters.

Roller skating, like marbles, rope jumping and hopscotch,
is an almost universal spring and fall activity which today

is expanding to include the winter and summer months as
well. In view of its popularity with all age groups, the almost
automatic acceptance of skates as part of a child’s play
equipment, and the success of commercial indoor skating
rinks, it is surprising that we in the recreation movement
have not done more in making it an integral part of our in-

door and outdoor programs.

0 In most communities, roller skating is regarded as one
of the “self-directed” activities. We give it room on hard-
surfaced tennis courts, or on roped-off streets. We arrange
an occasional meet. We sometimes move it indoors (whcn
we can persuade the authorities that fibre, rubber or wooden
wheels won’t ruin the gym floor) and we give an occasional
“party-on-wheels.” We seldom really integrate it into ’our
over-all program, give instruction, plan progressive activi-
ties in it as skill improves, stimulate teen-agers and adults to
take part, and make roller skating the colorful, rhythmic,
exciting and dramatic activity ‘that it can be.

We’ve let commercial recreation far outdistance us. It’s
not too late, however, to catch up! We can take advantage of
the appeal of roller skating. It has speed, action, grace,
movement, skill. It can be enjoyed alone or in groups. It
combines well with racing, dancing,'music, drama. It has
no age or sex limitations. It can be indoors or outdoors.
It’s a good lead-up for ice skating and for dancing. It’s
good exercise for “slim and trim” adult groups. It has
spectator appeal. Families can enjoy it, so will servicemen.

It’s not expensive. Outdoor skates are owned personally;
indoor skates can be rented. Civic clubs might be willing to
furnish them as a service project. Commercial rinks often
make special prices for groups brought in under leadership.
The wear and tear on hardwood floors of school gyms is no
more excessive than for any other activity. Costumes, when
needed, can be supplied hy the skaters, come from the cos-
tume box, or can be a good project for the arts and crafts
department, or a mother’s club. Rowdiness and excessive
speed can be controlled by the use of music, and by a plan-
ned program of skating events.

Continuity and Progression

The roller skating program should be a continuous one,
leading to a natural progression of skill and events. It
should cut across the whole program of:

Clubs. It lends itself beautifully to clubs—all-girl, all-boy,
mixed, adult, special, and so on.,..The Rollaways, Free-

428

The New Trier High School at Winnetka,

Illinois, sponsors roller skating program.

Roller Skating

and the Recreation Program

 

Wheelers, Roller Racers, Whirlaways, will form nature
groups for' instruction, for special types of skating, for Spf
cial parties, trips, picnics, for care of skates, skating et
quette, and for a source of special “acts” or the cast f0
spectator shows or demonstrations.

Athletics. Plaili “sidewalk skating” can lead, through ir
struction, to many kinds of Special athletic skills—racing
jumping, coasting, back skating, twirling—all useful in spa
cial roller meets, fun to do, and to watch. Specialty act
can be developed for carnivals, amateur shows, talent nights
demonstrations, meets, and so on. ’

Dancing. Skating to music leads straight to dancing! A
skill develops, the dance instructor can teach simple danc
steps and routines on skates. The discipline and cooperati01
needed by a dance-on-skates group is very wholesome. Am
for teen-agers, it is excellent for the deve10pment of boy
girl relationships. It deve10ps grace and poise; and it 3131
gives the shy boy and girl a chance to be together withod
embarrassment.

Music. As in most physical activities, music lends addet
enjoyment and, in fact, increases skill. The school or play
ground band, recorded music, a juke box, a piano—all ca]
be used. A loudspeaker system for special events is im
portant. Choice of music is important. The rhythm ShOlllt
be sharply marked. Marches, two-steps, foxtrots and tango
are usually good.

Arts and Crafts. Anything is more fun if it’s colorful ant
dressed up! Making costumes and sets can be projects f0]
the sewing club, drama club, mothers’ clubs. Designing
sketching, painting, stenciling and sewing are all involved.

A skating race with small boys as clowns is more fun thar
one with them in everyday jeans or slacks. Teen-age boy:
with bright cummerbunds are more colorful and gay. Littlt
girls in Dutch costumes will get applause even when out 0‘
step. Comedy acts ust call for special costumes!

And tied up also in arts and crafts are possibilities sucl
as the sketch club, or the clay modelers’ club trying tc
catch the skater’s movements, the painting class using livt
models—and of course the photography club turning out in
full force—not to mention the need for posters, handbills.
and so on, to advertise all special events.

Drama. As skating takes hold, and special skills improve, a
special Skaterama, or Rollerama will evolve. The drama
leader can help plan the theme, the sequences, the sets, just
as the music and dance leaders help with the choreography
and music. The skaters, however, should share in all this
planning.

Paper Santa Claus2

This Santa Claus (Figure II) can be made from any kind
of paper or cellophane and in many different sizes to suit
the individual need. If you are not good at drawing, out a
face from an old Christmas card or magazine. In this case
you will have to build the body to fit the cut-out head. Many
characters may be made by this method, perhaps using
family snap shots for your cut-outs.

1. Draw figure from the shoulders down on tissue paper.
Make narrow folds crosswise of the entire piece as indi-
cated by dotted lines.

2. Draw two long arms, fold as you did the body.

3. Cut from light weight cardboard: a head, two hands, two
feet and a toy sack. Ink in features.

4. Paste cardboard head, hands, feet and bag to body. Put
cord hanging in top of cap.

Bead Dolls for Your Tree2

1. Thread two needles on a long, strong thread.
2. Slide a bead t0 the center of the thread between the two

needles.

3. Bring both needles down through the next head to the
neck.

4. Cross the two needles in opposite directions through the
neck.

5. Bring both needles down through the body bead.

6. Cross in opposite directions through the hips.

7. String five beads on each needle for the legs and through
a foot bead. ‘

8. Retrace each needle back up to the neck and cross
through the neck in opposite directions.

9. String on four beads for arms; add one for a hand.

10. Retrace back through arms, cross through neck again,
or up through the head, hat and top bead; tie and form loop

for hanging. (See Figure III.)

Mail Boxes

Mail boxes are erected in front of each of the elementary
schools several weeks before Christmas. Letters are posted
to Santa Claus without postage. A return address is re-
quested. The letters are picked up by Santa’s “helpers” and
answered. No commitments are made. This project is ex-
tremely: popular and is co-sponsored by the Junior Women’s

Club.—Teaneck, New Jersey.

Toy Shower Day

Sando Bologna, of the Waterbury Republican, reports in
connection with Torrington’s (Connecticut) Christmas Vil-
lage (see RECREATION, November 1949) that a Toy Shower
Day is designated about one week before the village opens
for its two:week stand. At that time city merchants and gen-
erous Torringtonites donate hundreds of gifts for the pro-
ject. The park and recreation department, meantime, takes
out from storage the thousands of gifts bought during the
year.

Also, that a Telephone Day is set aside on which to take
toys to home-bound boys and girls. Just before Christmas,

Hospital Day is observed when toys are brought to child
patients in Torrington’s Hungerford Hospital.

Says Mr. Bologna,“ “Carl Bozenski gave a lot of thought
in planning Christmas Village during a four-year illness.
While in a sanitorium, he wondered how he could show his
appreciation for the nice things that the Torrington folks did
while he was hospitalized. They had sent him letters, pack-
ages and gifts. When he returned to his ob with the park
and recreation department, he set into motion the idea for

a village to bring Yuletide cheer to kids——-with no com-
mercialism attached.”

Is There a Santa Claus?

The original editorial which appeared in the New York
Sun, and with which we are all familiar, was used in Sum-
ter, South Carolina, last year as the basis of a Christmas
pageant. This editorial is also excellent for your story-
telling group at Christmas, or to be read aloud at any
Christmas gathering. Look up the original and refresh
your memory. (RECREATION, December 1948, page 387.)

Virginia interrupts his reading the paper.)

NARRATOR: As he strokes her hair tenderly, Virginia
gathers her courage and says:

CHILD’S VOICE: Papa, everyone else is so gay and happy
tonight. I wish I were!

MAN’S VOICE: Well now, suppose you tell me what’s troub-

CHILD’S VOICE: Papa, Papa. Is there a Santa Claus?

NARRATOR:,, Virginia’s father is a wise and gentle man.
He thinks carefully of all the answers to this dillicult ques-
tion, and then he says:

and will answer you. You may be sure, my dear, that you

can believe whatever he says.

involved—-—and cannot be shattered. This question re-
ires a real—-an honest—a sincere answer.

NARRATOR: To all the boys and girls in this country, that
bpired answer goes out each year. Here in 1952 is his
Iwer: ( Editor reads in pantomime) Virginia, your little
Ends are wrong. They have been affected by the scepti-
,m of a sceptical age. They do not believe except they
(3. They think that nothing can be which is not compre-
insible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether
ey be men’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe
' ours, man is a mere insect—an ant, in his intellect, as com-
Ired with the boundless world about him, as measured by

PROGRAM

NARRATOR: There would be no childlike faith then—-—no
poetry, no romances to make tolerable this existence. We
should have no enjoyment, except in the sense and sight.
The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would
be extinguished.

( Lights off scene—on editor)

NARRATOR: Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as
well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire
men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch
Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming,
what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that
is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things
in the world are those that neither children nor men can see.
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not,
but that’s no proof that they are not there.

( Lights of} editor—on dance group.)

DANCE: Fairy Dance Group.
( Fade of} dance group—on editor)

NARRATOR: Nobody can conceive or imagine all the won-
ders there are unseen and unseeable in the world. You tear
apart the baby’s rattle and you see what makes the noise in-
side, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not
the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the
strongest that ever lived, could tear apart.

( Lights 0,6 editor—up on tableau)

TABLEAU: Living Picture—-—Faith, Fancy, Poetry, Love

NARRATOR: Only faith, fanpy, poetry, love, romance, can
push aside that curtain and View and picture the supernal
beauty and glory beyond.

there is nothing else real and abiding. No Santa Claus!
Thank God, he lives—and he lives forever. A thousand
years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years
from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of child-

hood.

Yes, Virginia—there is a Santa Claus.

INFORMAL OBSERVATIONS
ON RECREATION BOARD MEETINGS

[‘HE WEAKEST link in many recrea-

tion systems is the slip-shod way in
Fhich board meetings are planned and
onducted. Recreation board meetings
an be an inadequate eXperience for
veryone concerned if time and effort
re not put into them. They can also

just happen.” Someone has to spend
many hours in planning details and
;athering necessary materials. It is the
oint responsibility of the board and
he superintendent in any recreation
rystem to see that meetings. are con-
luctcd properly.

A good board meeting should be pur-
Ioscful, business-like, informative,
:hallcnging, friendly—and short. The
ward should have decisions to make
kusually on the recommendations of the
superintendent)——a solid reason for
neing present. There should be subjects

presented that will offer a challenge.
Information should be available con-
cerning all phases of the program or
topics to be discussed.

The meeting should be business-like
but not so much so that all the fun is
taken out of it. Following a set pattern
too closely can be as colorless as having
no pattern at all. A friendly and har-
monious atmosphere should prevail. A
wise and efficient chairman will keep
the discussion on the subject and still
pcrmit all members to eXpress them-
selves freely. A feeling of good will is
necessary and a short deviation from
the subject under discussion is not
harmful. Many times it is the best
thing that can happen.

Having short board meetings does
not mean that much cannot be accom-
plished. Some meetings will be longer
than others but at no time should they
be allowed to drag on and on. We all
dislike meetings that last too long. After
an hour we are usually ready to call a
time out. It is sometimes better to leave
business unfinished than to prolong the

Russell J. F oval

meeting to the point where interest di-
minishes. The chairman is in a position
to keep the meeting moving along, yet
get a great deal done and give everyone
a feeling of having accomplished some-
thing.

I have heard recreation superinten-
dents say that their boards meet only a
few times a year or when something
really important is to be considered. In
such cases the program is either not
very good or it is a “one man show.”
When boards do not have enough busi-
ness to hold regular meetings, it indi-
cates that someone is not on the job.
Either the board members are not inter-
ested or they pass the buck to the super-
intendent and staff. This is not good
for the recreation board, the staff or
the program. Superintendents of recre-
ation need all the help they can get,
and the board is the first group they
should turn to for assistance. . The
board should be interested enough to
have regular meeting dates at least once
a month. Too much can happen in one
month for an executive, no matter how
well qualified, to establish policies and
to run the program alone without the
full cooperation and help of the board.
A certain day of the month should be
designated for meetings in the by-laws
of the board. This date should be ad-
hered to at all times. Dates should not
be changed for the convenience of one
or two members. If a quorum can be
present, the meeting should be held.

The time of day that meetings are

435

held is most important. All members
must be considered when making this
decision. Noon meetings meet the ap-
proval of some but the length of time
available is apt to be too short. Most
people try to get back to their jobs by
one-thirty. By the time food is ordered
and eaten, much of the noon period is
gone. Business is conducted under hap-
hazard conditions with interruptions or
ordering, being served and eating. Not
enough attention is focused on the real
purpose of the meeting. The entire af-
fair is likely to be too rushed to accom-
plish much. Afternoon meetings, early
or late, are usually not too satisfactory.
People cannot get away from their jobs
to meet in the early afternoon and if
they meet around four o’clock, they find
themselves tired from a day’s work and
wanting to get home to dinner.

The evening meeting seems to be the
most satisfactory time for a number of
reasons. It allows everyone to go home
after work, get cleaned up, and possibly
relax a little. By meeting in the early
evening, the business can be finished in
time to allow the members to go to other
functions. It affords an Opportunity for
the members who can do so to stay after
the meeting is over and visit with the
superintendent or other board mem-
bers. The evening meeting does not
have the hurried atmosphere of a day
meeting and usually a better job can
be done.

The place of board meetings can add
to or detract immeasurably from the

 

sessions. A meeting in a public dining
room, or anywhere it is necessary to eat,
is likely to be a failure. The interrup-
tions that usually occur make it difficult
to have an orderly and worthwhile meet-
ing. Meetings held in private clubs can
be unsatisfactory because of the sur-
roundings and because some members
might feel out of place. If possible the
meetings should be held in the recrea—

436

Records are available if
needed, arrangements can be made in
advance and interruptions can be held
to a minimum. The meeting place,
wherever it is, should be as quiet and
pleasant as possible. The selection of
the date, time and place of the meeting
should meet with the approval of at
least the majority of the members.

The recreation board meeting should
be planned well in advance. The agenda
for the coming month should be started
immediately after each meeting. Some-
times it is best to plan several months
ahead. A “live file” should be main-
tained and as ideas: or possible t0pics
for board discussion come up they
should be filed. Materials for the board
meeting, such as reports of activities and

correspondence, also should be put in
this file.

About a week before the meeting is
scheduled, a tentative agenda should be
prepared and discussed with the board
chairman. The chairman needs to be
familiar with all the items on the
agenda. If he becomes familiar with the
problems before the meeting, he will be
able to conduct a much better session
and will be in a position to assist the
superintendent in clarifying many
points. The chairman appreciates the
pre-meeting discussion as it enables him
to do a better job as presiding officer.

tion office.

The agenda should include calling to
order, approval of minutes, approval of
bills, approval of financial reports, re-
port of the executive, report of commit-
tees, communications, and old and new
business. This pattern need not be fol-
lowed to the letter. In fact, it is a good
policy to vary it from time to time.
Material for each board member and
the executive should include c0pies of
reports and recommendations. Vouch-
ers for bills, accident reports, and com-
munications should be at hand. Any
material that will give the board more
information regarding the department
should be made available.

Written notices of board meetings
should be sent to each member about
one week before the meeting. A COpy of
the minutes of the preceding meeting
should be included with the notice. The
member can read the minutes and be
prepared to act when he comes to the
meeting. This practice can save consid-

erable time at the meetings: It is we]
to communicate with the members threl
or four days early if there is any douh
that a quorum will be present. Thi
often helps get members to attend wh.
might otherwise have been “on th
fence.” Most members have many othe
responsibilities in the community and i
is sometimes hard for them to decid
which meeting they should attend. 1
your call indicates that they might b
needed at the recreation meeting t
make a quorum, they will probably 13
at your meeting. The last call and fine
check is the day of the meeting. On
might ask, “Why call them a secon
time?” Things can happen at the la:
minute that will change their plan:
Sickness or business problems coul
arise in a short time. It is better to ca
the second time than to run the risk (
not having a quorum. It seems be:
many times to call board members afte
they reach their offices. If there are pet
ple on the board who cannot be reache
by phone at their offices, they should b
called at home. The executive gradt
ally gets to know the best time and plac
to call each member. By calling earlyi
the morning there is time to Chang
plans if for some unexpected reason
quorum cannot be, present. If at tl.
last minute the chairman cannot attent
the executive will want to communica1
with the vice-chairman and review tl
agenda with him.

The meeting itself needs considerab‘
planning and attention. The superi1
tendent should be present at least fiftee
minutes early. He should be sure tll:
there is a large table, adequate chair
ash trays, pencils, writing pads, an
such available. Conversation piecl
such as new pictures of program acti‘
ties, magazine articles or craft iten
can be handy for the board memb:
who arrives a few minutes early. Tl
agenda material for each membu
should have his name on it. It is a goc
idea to place this material at the san
position on the table at each meetirn
This encourages the member to sit .
the same place and know that his n1
terial will be there. He can thus loc
over his material as soon as he arrive
Quite often this saves considerable tin]

If a quorum is present, the presidil
officer should start the meeting on tim

RECREATI1

Members should become used to meet-
ing at the scheduled hour, conducting
the business at hand and adjourning
promptly. The chairman of the board
should conduct the meeting. Some-
times the board depends Upon the super-
intendent to take the lead. This should
be avoided as much as possible. The
superintendent should let the board
members do most of the talking. They
will ask plenty of questions of him and
Ilhere will be adequate Opportunity for

him to speak. If the superintendent has

done his work' well before the meeting,
it will not be necessary for him to
mon0polize the discussions.

The result of all this planning is most
worthwhile. The little things and details
can make a meeting a success or a fail-
ure. A well-planned meeting will be
purposeful, business-like, informative,
challenging, friendly and usually brief.
The board members will discuss more
than finances. They will feel that they
are making a real contribution. They
will look upon the monthly meeting as

a pleasant and satisfying experience.
They will know that they are an impor-
tant part of the work. They will be
proud of the part they play.

Examine the inadequate recreation
programs throughout the country and
many times it will be found that the
board meetings are poorly or inade-

quately planned, conducted and evalu-
ated.

No member of the profession accepts a position as

superintendent of recreation unless he is fully in ac-
cord with the principle of recreation service as a function of
local government and unless he is confident that he is quali-
fied to serve to the advantage of the community.

The superintendent of recreation has a firm belief in

the dignity and worth of the services rendered by gov-
ernment. He has a constructive, creative, and practical atti-
htude toward urban problems and a deep sense of his own
social responsibility as a trusted public servant.

The superintendent of recreation is governed by the

highest ideals of honor and.integrity in all his public
and personal relationships in order that he may merit the
respect and confidence of the governing body of the rec-
rcation board, of other officials and employees, and of the
public which he serves. He believes that personal ag-
grandizement or profit secured by confidential information
or by misuse of public time is dishonest.

The superintendent of recreation as a community

leader submits policy proposals to the recreation
board and provides the board with facts and advice on
matters of policy to give it a basis for making decisions on
community goals. The superintendent of recreation defends
recreation policies publicly only after consideration and
adoption of such policies by the board.

The superintendent of recreation realizes that the
recreation board, the official representatives of the
people, is entitled to the credit for the establishment of
recreation department policies. The superintendent of rerea-
lion avoids coming in public conflict with the board on

rECEMBER 1953

controversial issues. Credit or blame for policy execution
rests with the superintendent.

The superintendent of recreation considers it his duty

continually to improve his ability and his usefulness
and to deve10p the competence of his associates in the use
of leadership techniques.

The superintendent of recreation keeps the community
informed on local recreation affairs. He emphasizes
friendly and courteous service to the public. He recognizes
that the chief function of the local government at all times

is to serve the best interests of all the pe0ple on a nonpartisan
basis.

The superintendent of recreation, in order to preserve
his integrity as a professional administrator, resists
any encroachment on his responsibility for personnel,

believes he should be free to carry out board policies without
interference, and deals frankly with the board as a unit

rather than with its individual members.'

The superintendent of recreation handles all matters

of personnel on the basis of merit. Fairness and im-

partiality govern the superintendent of recreation in all mat-

ters pertaining to appointments, pay adjustments, promo-
tions, and discipline in the recreation department.

10 The superintendent of recreation curries no favors.

He handles each problem, Without discrimination, on

the basis of principle and justice.

WHAT IS A BUDGET? It is not the co-
lossal headache that some may

term it, but rather it is a plan for financ-
ing an enterprise over a given period of
time. Once this plan has been approved
by an appropriating body, the budget is
the controlling financial plan for exe-
cuting a program of operation and of
service.

In Arlington, Virginia, the depart-
ment of recreation and parks uses its
budget as a work plan, a yardstick, and,
during budget hearings, as a public re-
lations device.

How is this done?

First, we must consider how Arling-
ton’s recreation department formulates
its proposed budget for the coming
year. Instead of the purely expedient
base of the expenditures of the past
year and of the supposed ability of the
community to pay, Arlington works
from a long-range plan outlined in a
formalized six-year program of growth.

With this fore-knowledge of the
goals toward which the department is
moving, recreation executives can make
intelligent provision for expansion of
facilities or programs or both. Granted
that such goals are flexible, they have
been set and offer definite guideposts
for budget requests.

Here, in Arlington, the budget origin-
ates with the section supervisors who
prepare their proposals on the basis of

tion in Arlington County, Virginia.

the desirable program expansion for
the given year within the over-all plan,
and who consult with division heads on
costs of such programs in terms of per-
sonnel, equipment, facilities, and other
items.

Once the outline of programs and
costs has been compiled, the division
heads consult with the recreation di-
rector and the head of the department’s
accounting division. Since the recrea-
tion department has its own accounting
division, the cost accounting system
easily enables the director to determine
the exact cost of any given service,
broken down into functions. Compared
with attendance figures, such cost ac-
counting also furnishes a statistical
basis for estimating the efficiency and
economy of specific programs.

Since every person in each division
knows the exact amount of his share of
the proposed. budget and exactly what
this share is expected to provide, he
may be called into the discussion to
explain and ustify his figures.

\Vhen the departmth has agreed
upon its proposed budget for the com-
ing year, the figures are sent to the
county manager who, in turn, invites
the department director and the budget
officer in to consult with him and with
the county finance director. Now, in-
cluding recommendations from the
county managcr, the budget passes to
the county board for consideration, and
is made available in printed form so
that any interested organization or in-
dividual may have a copy for study and

consideration.
Because many of the citizens are

vitally interested in recreation prob-

lems and may have excellent ideas 0
their own to offer, they often ask th
recreation director to visit their organi
zations for discussion and explanation
Since some of their suggestions hav
been made long before budget time
they are often curious to know wha
disposal has been made of their idea
as well as to hear the ideas of the de
partment itself.

Eventually, the county board holds a
public hearing at which groups and in
dividuals may express their feelings re
garding cuts or additions.

Finally, the county board weighs a1:
arguments, agrees upon a definite bud-
get, and sets the tax rate for the coming
year.

Obviously, when the department di-
rector appears before citizens’ associa-
tions, PTA’s, and other groups, the rec-
reation budget plan immediately is
transformed into an important instru-
ment of public relations and publicity.
Instead of speaking merely in terms of
abstract dollars, the director translates-
figures into such human terms as play-
ground assistants, picnic tables, sports
equipment, and “ telephone service.
Since, in Arlington, the budget has been
prepared in terms of meeting commu-
nity needs within the framework of the
progressive over-all plan, such interpre-
tation may be made both effectively and
explicitly.

As an example of how this is done,
let us assume that an influential com-
munity organization, thinking in terms
of dollars alone, advocates economy
and the deletion of $10,000 from the
recreation budget. In dollars, this I
means only a drop of a cent or two in

RECREATION

e tax rate. When the recreation di-
ctor translates $10,000 into services,
c cut may mean no spring play-
ounds, or no custodial or maintenance
.vice for a park, or no maintenance of
[ii fields. With new understanding of
6 meaning of $10,000 to the recrea-
)11 program, the organization will
'obably favor and recommend the
nount which was requested in the
'ginal budget.

In Arlington, the recreation dircctor
has not presume to dctermine what the
unty can afford in recreation services.
Ie program of the department is set
Ith in terms of meeting expressed
eds within the outline of the long-
Iige plan, and the director lets the
[nnlunity decide for itself whether or
it it wants to and can take the finan-
al rCSponsibility to pay.

During the operations year, the bud-
3t continues to servc as a public rela-
:J-FIS dcvice——rather a back-handed one,
.this instance. For example, when an
ate taxpayer calls in to ask why his
pal park is still undeveloped, why the

tion upheld such cuts.

With the appropriated budget figures
in his hand, the director notifies his di-
vision heads of their allotments, and the
new budget formally becomes the recrc-
ation work plan for the coming year.

When the program can proceed as plan-i

ned, the year’s work is simple. When
occasional cuts force curtailment of a
program, the division head must decide
how best to handle the cut without un-
due detriment to future expansion. Most
important of all, no matter what the
final appropriation, the entire depart-
ment must remember the long-range
goals and guide its program in their
direction.

Because the entire staff has partici-
pated personally in budget planning,
from start to finish, the department is
usually highly budget-conscious. This
desirable state of mind furnishes an in-
ternal incentive toward economy of
operations as well as toward whole-
hearted cooperation with the cost ac-
countant.

Through its cost accounting, Arling-
ton has a clear picture of the financial
status of all programs at all times, with
both object and functional breakdowns,
The operating budget is divided into
three parts: Administration, Activities,
and Development and Maintenance. In

addition, the department has a separate
budget for capital outlay, also divided
into three parts: Labor, Equipment,
and Materials. Within each division are
additional breakdowns under personal
services (staff), contractural scrvices
(telephone, lights, and so on), supplies
and materials (fuel, signs, office sup-
plies, and so on), and equipment (office
machines, and so on).

In many instances, even finer break-
downs result in secondary classifica-
tions for such specific items as “waist-
high grills (12), power mower (1),
card tables (6), and kiln (1).”

A brief narrative accompanies each
section of the budget, giving an abbre-
viated description of the services fur-
nished by each division. _

Arlington’s cost accounting system is
set up in such a way that each division
head and each supervisor can know ex-
actly how much his program is costing
and how much remains in his account
whenever' this information is needed.
In addition, the systcm gives the appro-
priating authorities a clear picture of
the department’s financial. situation, of
the usc made of allotted funds, and of
the soundness and scope of the depart-
ment’s program within the limits of
such allotments.

With an accounting system of this

ADMINISTRATION

type kept up-to-date every day, estima-
tion of the amount of money required
to expand the program each year be-
comes a relatively simple matter of
checking files and making easy mathe-
matical computations.

Therefore, in Arlington, the budget
is a work plan which sets forth in mon-
etary terms the exact amount of service
which can be given the community dur-
ing the year. Through up-to-date ac-
counting, the budget becomes a yard-
stick which shows how much service was
given with the funds allotted. And the
budget, through interpretation to the
public, serves as a public relations tool
which clearly explains how many serv-
ices, and which ones, may be bought by
the community with the year’s appro-
priations.

The following “Narrative of Main-
tenance Program,” is set up on another
special budget form:

The development and maintenance
division is reSponsible for the following
services:

Parks: This year we will have five
parks, a total 101 acres, operating for
a period of at least six months full-
time. Park custodians keep attendance
records, accumulate all trash and litter,
cut grass, trim hedges, clean and service

eral keep the parks in order. Additional
maintenance men make any necessary
repairs to equipment, distribute tire-
wood to picnic areas, haul trash to the
county dump, and clear and grub brush
in wooded areas.

Ball Fields: The number of ball fields
maintained by the department is twenty-
seven. Maintenance includes dragging,
grading and dressing up the fields in the
spring. These operations are continued
during the summer as needed. A two-
man crew cuts infield grass, dresses up
infields, and lines off the fields daily
during the playing season.

The Parking Problem

The part which recreation plays in
: parking problem of large cities is
'ealed by a survey of downtown park-
; conducted by the Cleveland City
mning Commission. This report,
Eh is presented in unusually effective
Phic forln, indicates that of the per-
§ who use parking areas while they
engaged in recreation, 12 per cent
' for more than four hours, 44 per
from one to four hours, and 44 per
less than one hour. Of these per-
who use parking areas while they
[engaged in recreation 40 per cent
I walk more than 800 feet from the
ting area, 25 per cent from 400 to
) feet, and 35 per cent less than 400
t. These distances are greater than
used by any other group of

Irrkers” except shoppers.

Survey of Physical Education
Facilities

Rn analysis of the gymnasiums and
[cor facilities related to the physical
Ication programs in 269 schools in

ry, 1953 issue of Scholastic Coach.

built before 1930 than since 1940.

Size is not the only limitation on
a diversified program, for very few
schools have additional rooms for in-
dividual correctives, swimming, or for
other special activities. 3"

Another comment, is on the very
small part which local education au-
thorities played in determining the
dimension of the gymnasiums. Practi-
cally no influence from local school
staffs or lay groups was reported.

Unsegregated Use

According to the 1951 report of the
department of recreation and parks in
Baltimore, “In July 1951 the board of
recreation and parks authorized the un-
segregated use of all golf courses Opera-
ted by the bureau. This resulted in an
increase in .the numher of rounds
played.” The board also arranged to
allow Negroes the exclusive use of Fort
Smallwood Beach ten days a month.

CCC Budgeting

The pamphlet entitled Budgeting for
1953, issued by Community Chests and
Councils of America, Incorporated, in-
dicated a large and expanding portion
of local Chest appropriations for leisure-
time services. In 1953, recreation, in-
formal education and group-work serv-
ices received 40.41 per cent of the total
apprOpriations to local agencies in 168
cities. 39.6 per cent of the income of
leisure-time agencies receiving funds
from the Chest or United Fund came
from these sources.

Compared with the 1935-39 average,
the 1953 appropriations to local leisure-
time agencies from Community Chests
in 27 cities represented an increase of
259.1 per cent. This increase is much
greater than that reported for other
fields of service receiving Chest funds.
As compared with the 1947-49 average,

to local leisure-time
agencies from Chests in 43 cities repre-
sented an increase of 31.7 per cent. This
was a higher percentage than recorded
for any other type of service except
“health, other than hospitals,” which
was 46.7 per cent. Appropriations for
leisure-time activities apparently are

apprOpriations

leveling off as compared with their strik-
ing increase the preceding ten years.

City-School Cooperation

There are several factors that have
contributed to the success and the de-
ve10pment of the recreation program of
the Cooper River Park and Playground
Commission, in North Charleston,
South Carolina. First and foremost has
been the close cooperation of the
Cooper River School District No. 4. The.
two groups are entirely separate, yet by
mutual agreement the park and play-
ground commission operates play-
grounds on school property and has
spent several thousand dollars in the
deveIOpment of them. The school young-
sters enjoy the facilities during the
school day, and playground supervisors
take over in the afternoon and during
the summer vacation period. There is
no duplication of playground facilities,
which results in a saving for the tax
payers of the community. Mr. A. F.
Heinsohn, chairman of this commission
and also of the school commission, is
greatly interested in the recreational
development of the area.

Another factor is the largenumber of
enthusiastic volunteer workers. Still
another is a friendly county legislative
delegation that has approved the bud-
gets recommended by the commission.
Without this support in providing the
funds the program would not be pos-
sible. County agencies, such as the
county council through its public works
and prison farm labor, have assisted the
commission in developing park and rec-
reation sites throughout the area.

ADMINISTRATION

 

Wyandotte Gets Swimming Pool

This is a story of unceasing effort. It got a big push early, when George H.

Benjamin F. Y:

Baker, vice president of Employee and Public Relations, and a representative of
the union, Local 12270, U .M .W., appeared before the city council to voice Wyan-

dotte Chemicals since're interest and endorsement of the pool.
The pool aroused a civic spirit as few issues had before. And thanks to our
American way of doing things, the issue was settled in a free and democratic

manner——at the ballot box.

 

A COMMUNITY of 40,000 people on April 6, 1953, went to
the polls and voted for a bond issue to build an
indoor-outdoor swimming pool which would cost $490,000.

Sixty-seven per cent of the voters approved the proposal
which required a 60 per cent majority. Wyandotte, Michi-
gan, located ten miles south of Detroit, is five and three-
quarters square miles in area, with approximately four miles
of frontage on the Detroit River.

The Problem

Years ago the citizens in the community enjoyed swim-
ming and fishing in the river which, at that time, was clean
and free from bacteria. With the advent of industry, how-
ever, it slowly became contaminated and unsafe for swim-
ming. Industry was dumping oil and other impurities into
the water.

W’yandotte was faced with the need of more swimming
facilities. Only one indoor pool, in the Roosevelt High
School, was available and that was used by two junior high
schools and the high school itself. People of the community
had no place to swim. Therefore, it was necessary for those
who could not use the school pool to travel up to twenty-fivc
miles to inland lakes and other swimming areas. Many of
the places they chose for swimming were far from ideal, and
added to the natural hazards of open lakes and deep pools

was the ever present traflic hazard and the inconvenie:
and expense of traveling to and from these places.

For years, Wyandotte has dreamed of a municip:
owned swimming pool. A pool within our own boundar.
where our children could enjoy the most invigorating E
healthful recreation possible; where we know they are s
and under proper supervision; where those unable to sv‘
would be taught by competent instructors; and where a]
life guards would be constantly on duty.

A Proposed Solution

The board of education of the city contemplated build
a junior high school in the same area as the proposed indo
outdoor swimming pool. 50 the board of education,
mayor and council, and the recreation commission met; a
a solution was arrived at whereby the city of Wyandc
would place on the ballot, in the April 6, 1953 election
proposal for a bond issue of $490,000 to build an indo
outdoor pool connecting with the new junior high school
the board of education to use the pool during school ho‘
and the city to use the pool after school.hours and on n'
school days for city recreation programs.

The clergy, business, industry, service clubs, women’s
ganizations, labor unions, veterans’ organizations and s
dents from various schools were brought in to form a c
zens’ committee for  municipal swimming pool. 'I

II talks to PTA groups, service clubs, veterans’ groups,

the summer, thus providing the fcatures of an outdoor pool.
Sixty per cent of the pool will be designated for shallow
water swimming and forty per ccnt for deep water swimming
and diving use. Water will be maintained at a constant tem-
peraturc during the winter and chemically treated and filter-
ed for purification at all times. The structure enclosing the
pool will provide a gallery for spectators and other facilities
necessary for the operation of the pool. The city owns the
thirty-two-acre tract on which the pool is to be built, so no
condemnation or demolition of buildings will be involved.
The recreation department evisions complete facilities for
baseball, softball, football, ice skating, wading pool, an out-
door shell, picnic ground, and ample parking space.

The main reasons for passage of this bond issue were:
(1) Too many teen-agers were leaving our community to go
elsewhere to swim. (2) The taxpayers were saved a sizeable
sum by a joint effort between the board of education and the
city. (3) The intensive campaign waged by a great many
groups and individuals who were confident that an indoor-
outdoor swimming pool, available to public and parochial
school children and adults the year around, would be a valu-
able asset to the community, and make Wyandotte a better
place to live and work and play.

The people of Wyandotte are just like those in any other
community. They realize that, “It costs less to build healthy
minds and bodies than to have to rebuild them!’-’

RECREATION

in the
AMERICAN COMMUNITY

By HOWARD c. DANFORD

 

 

Here is the most complete coverage ever prepared
of-the field of American public recreation: espe-
cially the aspects dealing with practical opera-
tional problems of organization and administra-
tion. The author has had broad experience both
as a city recreation director and as a college
teacher of the subject. Basing his approach here
on the needs of an urbanized and industrialized
democracy, he discusses the problems involved
in operating playgrounds, community centers, and
municipal athletics, with a full consideration of
safety in recreation and liability for accidents.
A stimulating, practical book for all recreation
workers.

at the

1953 National Recreation Congress

The general problems related to rec-
reation personnel received considerable
attention in Philadelphia at the 1953
National Recreation Congress. The
membership at large should become
familiar with four phases of the per-
sonnel problem that evolved as high-
lights of the week.

Placement Service. The activities oc-
curring in placement services perhaps
inaugurated a new era in the field of
recreation. The dirth of qualified rec-
reation leaders to fill available positions
appeared more acute than ever before.
This condition kept the representatives
of various recreation agencies busy in-
terviewing potential candidates as well
as encouraging others to help in the
total recruitment program. The follow-
ing few examples show the extent of the
services provided:

1. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jensen of
the National Recreation Association
spent endless hours each day interview-
ing candidates in an attempt not only
to develop comprehensive personnel
records but also to match personal qual-
ifications against the demands of vari-
ous job openings.

2. The United States Air Force sought
to fill various openings.

3. The United States Army Special
Services endeavored to recruit a large
number for overseas and stateside va-
cancies for club and program directors,

ation at Teachers College, Columbia
University, is vice-chairman of the

cruitment, Training and Placement.

craft specialists and librarians. Many
new jobs have been created recently in
the European theater.

4. The Young Women’s Christian As-
sociation, Girl Scouts of America and
the Campfire Girls representatives
sought candidates to fill many positions
in their reSpective organizations.

5. An opportunity to fill out forms for
the national roster of recreation per-
sonnel was made available.

.6. A “Job Mart” aiiorded agencies an

opportunity to place their job oppor-
tunities in an open file available to all
who attended. On the other hand those
who sought positions also placed their
qualifications in the open files. This
process not only opened the door for
a better exchange of placement informa-
tion but also tended to eliminate many
unnecessary interviews.

This total placement eiiort raises two
vital issues. First, the need for intense
recruitment and eventual placement is
a most serious factor which faces the
profession nationwide. Second, the role
which colleges, universities and other
preparation institutions play, both in
the education of new recreation leaders
and the re-education of those now em-
ployed, may determine to a large ex-
tent the gains which the total recreation
movement makes in the immediate de-
cade ahead.

Personnel Sessions. Three major ses-
sions dealing directly with personnel

combined to help make the 1953 Con-

gress a success.

1. “College Training—Student Field

Teachers College, dealt with the I
issues involved in field work in v

2. “Personnel-———People, Perform;

joyed a combination luncheon-business
meeting. All .members who attended
were the invited guests of Paul Doug-
lass, chairman of the National Advis-
ary Committee. The meeting included a
discussion of many problems relating to
personnel which have confronted the
National Advisory Committee in the
past year. Other related topics also re-
ceived attention; and the committee ap-
proved the “In-service Training” re-
port. This will result in the immediate
publication of the document, which
should prove of great interest to both
recreation and park personnel:

It was the consensus of committee
opinion that all further action by the
sub-committees should be the result of
c00perative action, if possible, with all
other groups and agencies that have
mutual interests in the problems of per-
sonnel. This approach will insure not
only a better solution to the problems
but also a wider acceptance of the
results.

In addition to the above, the other

sub-committees made progress reports;
the feasibility of a national personnel
survey was discussed and the proposal,
presented by Paul Douglass, was en-
dorsed by the committee. New busi-
ness was presented by Mr. Sutherland.
The able leadership of Paul Douglass
resulted in a stimulating, interesting
and compact meeting.

In conclusion, it seems apparent that
the various personnel problems have
become of prime importance to the rec-
reation profession. It is generally
agreed that progress in the immediate
years ahead and in the distant future
depends upon the degree to which these
problems are resolved. The importance
of good recreation leadership and com-
petent personnel on all levels cannot be
overlooked because the profession can
pr0gress only in relation to the people
actively engaged in it.

It is sincerely hoped that much more
progress will be made by the time of
the Congress in 1954 at St. Louis. At
that time, this large area of concern will
once more be re-evaluated.

and Events

 

Walter Roy, another thirty-year man
and director of recreation of the Chi-
cago Park District, has broadened and
developed the concept of recreation in
that metropolitan area so that leisure-
time activities have been made avail-
able to people of all ages. Mr. Roy has

participated widely in state and na- .

tional organizations and his progressive
thinking, along with the ability to com-
municate his ideas, has influenced rec-
reation people everywhere.

Recognition

* An unofficial, but equally valid,
citation was proffered in the Milwaukee
Bay View Observer to the Department
of Municipal Recreation and particu-
larly to Miss Webster, director of Lewis
Field and Beulah Brinton Social Center,
and her associates. The open letter ap-
peared in the newspaper in September
and was signed by “The Norton
Family.” It stated the family’s gratitude
for the department’s “clubs and hun-
dreds of activities that have kept our
children without an idle day, and how
can too much praise be given to any
individual, group, organization or city
which offers full and happy days to its
youngsters and citizens.”

* Another. unofficial acknowledgement
was recently given in the East Orange
Record to Miss Frances H. Haire,
superintendent of recreation in East
Orange, New Jersey. Miss Haire was
named head of the recreation depart-
ment in 1925 and, since then, has built
a recreation system that well may serve
as a “model for many large com-
munities throughout the country.”

* Staton R. Curtis, director of recrea-
tion in Brunswick, Maine, has been
named “the outstanding young man
of the year” by the Brunswick Junior
Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Curtis
secured his master’s degree in recrea-
tion from Springfield College in 1947.
He has received this laudatory award

Ian NOW for the

7954 PM gang/teed

The National Recreation Congress is a valuable con-
once for anyone interested in recreation. Every recrea-
n program, public or private, should be represented—by
rd members as well as by professional workers. How
ny hundred more board and staff workers could have
nded the Philadelphia Congress if adequate plans had
11 made in time?

f planning starts early enough—before budgets are
optcd—and if tllcre is enough conviction that the Con-
ss is a valuable conference, it should be possible to over-
ne most obstacles to attending the St. Louis Recreation
ngress, September 27-October 1, 1954.

lany Congress delegates make formal reports on their
urn home. One such report, dated October 5 this year,
ntains such important testimony on the value of the
ngress that we want to share it widely in hope that
n more communities and agencies can be represented
St. Louis than were represented, by more than 1,500
egates, at Philadelphia.

First of all, the rcport was made immediately following
Congress to members of the city council, members of the
rk and recreation board, and to the city manager. In
* four-and-a-half-page report this community recreation
ecutive listed seventcen specific ideas which he had gar-
red at the Congress, and which he intended to do some-
'ng about. And finally, he listed several other reasons
y it had becn worthwhile for, the city to be represented
the Congress.

“When I mingled with the delegates of that great national
1ference I quickly realized that I was with the best.

  
 
   
   
  
  
   
   
 
 
  
   
   
   
 
  
 
  
   
  
 

is association was a challenge and an inspiration.”
He outlined briefly the range of topics discussed, the
akers who addressed the general sessions, and em-
sized the magnitude of the plans Philadelphia is execut-
in the field of recreation as given by Mayor Clark in
opening address.
He quoted Dr. Sockman, “The most dangerous age of
E is not youth and it is not man’s later' years, but it is
middle age. We must provide playgrounds for children

(1 activities for the aged; but, even more, we should be
ncerned about the middle-aged.”

He spent some time on the general session Planning for
Icreation in the Modern City since his city is “knee-deep”
I1 planning, as are many cities.

He referred to Bob Crawford’s speech at the close of
e Congress when Philadelphia’s deputy commissioner and
“made a profound state-
ent about the significance of the recreation congress from

perintendent of recreation . . .

the point of view of community recreation executives. He
stated that it was impossible for any (recreation) depart-
ment to live in a vacuum and to receive no outside ideas
or inspiration, and I sincerely hope that it will result in a
better recreation system in the city of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..”

Among the seventeen specific ideas he took home, and'
told about, were a four-day workshop for recreation leaders,
per capita costs for playground operation, purposes and ob-
jectives for the recreation program, uniforms and emblems
for playground workers, a small zoo as part of the nature
program, staff meetings with representatives of the press to
develop awareness of what is news, several ideas lumped
under the heading of in-service training, developing TV
programs in the several activity fields, several swimming
pool ideas, training for maintenance staff including school
custodians, steel bars instead of chains on swings, and
three new ideas from exhibitors at the Congress.

This one city got real help because it sent a wide-awake
delegate to the Philadelphia Recreation Congress.

It is not too soon for you and your department or agency
to begin planning to be represented at St. Louis. If we
can help with your planning, let us know.

Indiana Recreation Societies

The Graduate Recreation Society of
Indiana University has eleCted the fol-
lowing ollicers for the current year:
president, Bctty Van der Smissen,
Marion, South Dakota; vice-president,
John Hug, Davenport, Iowa; secretary,
Norma Jean Loveland, Terre Haute,
Indiana; treasurer, Michael Kiely, San
Mateo, California.

The Undergraduate Recreation So-
ciety has elected as presidcnt, Barbara
Walker, Washington, D. C.; vice-presi-
dent, Kenneth Badertscher, Fort
Wayne, Indiana; secretary, Barbara
Patterson, Highland Park, Illinois; his-
torian, Kathryne Strauser, Bloomfield,
Indiana.

The major project of the graduate
recreation society is the sponsorship of
the Audubon Screen Tours. Projects of
both societies include development
projects on the Bradford Woods Camp-
ing, Outdoor Education, and Recrea-
tion Area—a 2,200 acre wooded tract
operated by the department of recrea-
tion—and leadership projects on the
campus, local community and nearby
communities in the state.

High School Sports Night

An interesting high school sports
night was conducted by recreation stu-
dents from the University 0/ California,
last spring. This project was the result
of coordinated activities by several
community groups and the university
and reached beyond recreation major
students to include the entire Student
Association of Health, Physical Educa-
tion and Recreation. The event, super-
vised by faculty, included planned
activities—swimming, volleyball, table
tennis, folk dancing, social dancing and

stunts—in the physical education build-
ing at UCLA. It was a huge success
and has brought community pressurc
from other schools for similar events
during the year. The community is at-
tempting this as a means of controlling
youth activities during vacation periods
and to do a more adequate job of plan-
ning for their needs and interests. The
experience which students at the uni-
versity derive from this provides
another Opportunity for developing the
leadership so vitally needed in the
recreation profession. i

Listening and Viewing

Television

0 It was decided in the television meet-
ing at the 35th National Recreation
Congress that community recreation
departments ‘should first decide upon
their goals and whom they are trying
to reach before planning programs for
presentation on TV. In Philadelphia,
for instance, the department of educa-
tion cooperates with the bureau of
recreation to provide a program with
the following objectives:

1. To interpret the recreation program
to the community.

2. To increase family recreation in the
home.

3. To increase participation in the
local program.

Local “live” TV recreation presenta-
tions can be supplemented with motion
picture films, camera snaps and slides,
used in news broadcasts, breaks and
other spots. Recreation directors should
seek technical advice from TV studio
advisors. A TV channel in Los Angeles
held a ten-day training course for com-
munity organizations.

Suggested published material that
will help local recreation departments

in the use of TV:

0 Over two thousand applications have
been made to the FCC for television
stations. Largest TV network now has
only thirty-eight stations. Immediate
developments in TV will probably see
many independent stations using kinc-
scope and local program material. Op-
portunities for promotion of com-
munity recreation locally seem to be
enormous. The National Recreation
Association will shortly start a survey
of local TV programs featuring com-
munity recreation activities.

What Is Your Department Doing?

0 Radio management is aware of the
value of recreation departments” con-
tributions to its program schedule, but
the departments fail to utilize the radio
potential in stimulating their own pro-
grams.—Summary of remarks by Mr.
Cecil Hoskins, WWNC Station Man-
ager, Asheville, a panel speaker in the
radio and television session at the
annual North Carolina Recreation Con-
ference last year.

0 Radio station KTUC has for several
years, as a public service, opened its
doors to the Tucson, Arizona, recrea-
tion department and Pima County rec-
reation program for a joint weekly
fifteen-minute period. The program has
served as a vehicle for bringing recrea-
tion news of both departments and of
other states and cities to the com-
munity, and as a stage for local talent.
Spot checking has indicated a sur-
prisingly large listening audience.

0 The “Playground Quarter Hour,”
one of Hawaii’s oldest continuous radio
programs, was granted an additional
“quarter hour” by station KGU in
honor of its twentieth anniversary last
February. Twenty-two talented singers
and musician's were presented on the
program, including men and women
recreation directors and executives,
guitar-playing mothers from the hous-
ing areas and high school students.
Through the efforts of the music super-
visor and the hula-music specialists,
the program has presented, through the
years, qualitative programs of Ha-
waiian songs.

Recreation in the American
Community

Howard G. Danford. Harper and
Brothers, New York 16. Pp. 464. $5.00.

Recreation in the American Com-
munity is a thoughtful discussion of
many of the major policies and practices
of local public recreation activities. It
includes also practical, useful informa-
tion on the administration of local ser-
vices. Although the presentation reflects
somewhat the special experience of the
author in public recreation administra-
tion under public education authorities,
it contains a wealth of material of value
to all who are interested in the best pos-
sible public recreation services at the
community level.

The book is an effective combination
of sound philosophy and practical ad-
ministration and should be stimulating
and valuable reading for the experi-
enced worker as well as the student and
the newcomer to the field, Dr. Dan-
ford is to be congratulated particularly
on the emphasis throughout the book
on the need for quality in recreation
services and for quality of recrcation
experience on the part of the partici-
pating public—Arthur Williams, As-
sitant Executive Director, National Rec-
reation Association.

—Past and Present

Sidney Dillick. The Woman’s Press,

Dr. Dillick’s book should be required
reading for all administrative and
supervisory workers in recreational
agencies, both governmental and volun-
tary. It belongs on the reading list of
all professional schools and departments
for the training of recreation workers
and of social workers.

Publications

Covering the Leisure-lime Field

It brings together in readable form
sympathetic descriptions of a wide
variety of social movements, large and
small. The criteria of selection is their
relation to neighborhood and district
development in urban communities.
The reader feels that the author really
understood what the founders of these
movcments were trying to do. So often
descriptions of movements and organi-
zations reveal the describer’s feeling
about them more faithfully than they
convey the emotional and intellectual
motives of the founders. It is not so in

this book.
The book is readable both bccause of

its relatively non-technical language,
and succinctness.

It would have been helpful if Dr.
Dillick had elaborated just a little on
his definitions of “neighborhood” and
“district,” page 21. Neighborhood in
its specific sense should be used to de-
note an area within which most of the
needs of pre-adolescent children are
met. His “rule of thumb” definition of
it as “a relatively small area such as
that served by an elementary school”
is a convenient one and is true more
often than not. A neighborhood will
have in it those institutions which are
most immediately necessary to family
life—a grocery store, a drug store, a
“cleaner and presser,” and often a
parish church. It is the neighborhood
which provides the environment which
so vitally affects children and family
life. A district is an area within which
most of the needs of all members of the
family are met. True, the father and
perhaps the mother may be employed
outside of the district, but the high
school, the play field, and other institu-
tions serving young people and adults
are available within its borders.

While Dr. Dillick acknowledges the
accuracy and validity of these defini-
tions and writes frequently of organiza-

n

tions at the “neighborhood and district”
level, he neverthless drops equally
frequently into the common habit of
referring to both and even larger areas

as “neighborhood.” There are dif-

ferences between community organiza-
tions at the neighborhood level and at
the district level. The district has
cnough organizations to provide a dele-
gate type of council; many neighbor-
hoods, perhaps most neighborhoods do
not. Organizations calling themselves
neighborhood councils are very often
associations of citizens interested in
particular local problems. It would be
helpful if Dr. Dillick had been more
consistent and accurate in his use of

the word neighborhood.

Of special interest to recreation
workers are descriptions of councils
which accepted the fallacy that juvenile
delinquency is prevented by recreation
programs. There are also several illus-
trations of the difficulties encountered
when councils established primarily for
coordination and planning became in-
volved extensively in providing recrea-
tional or social services. The observa-
tion that one or the other task suffers in
the attempt to carry both should sur-
prise no one.

On the other hand, there are several
references to the inappropriateness of
“direct service agencies” becoming the
sponsor of an inter-organizational plan-
ning council at the district level. One is
tempted to ask “Why?” even though in
a well-organized community the point
made in the book is valid. Does the
mere fact that an agency, such as a com-
munity center, either governmental or
voluntary, provides recreational ser-
vices to a community render it unfit to
provide staff service to a district
council? The argument has been ad-
vanced that it has equal status with
other agencies which would be partici-
pating in the council and therefore
could not accept any “over-all” respon-
sibility.

Another question with which Dr.
Dillick could not deal in a book of this
size is this: Do all districts Ifeed profes-
sional staff service in order to develop
an effective district council?

The glory of a free society, such as
ours, is that the individual with imagi-
nation, vision, energy and know-how in
community relations will continue to
“spark” community organization at the
neighborhood and district level. Let no
district or neighborhood turn away
from qualified leaders because they
don’t represent what someone con-
siders to bc the “proper auspices.”——
John McDowell, Executive Director,
National Federation of Settlements and

Neighborhood Centers.
