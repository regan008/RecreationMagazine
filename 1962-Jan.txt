Lez‘ Voiz‘ he/p you do it the rig/72‘ way

Today’s biggest, fastest-growing sport among active teen-agers is SCUBA and skin diving. Across the
country, schools are adding it to physical education curricula, and forming after-hours SCUBA clubs.
Many teachers are accepting the responsibility for teaching SCUBA the right way. This sport is fun
and healthful, but proper safety precautions must be taken.

The sound way to treat SCUBA diving is to provide a proven program as well as time-tested standard
equipment for instruction use.

Voit—pioneer designer and leading manufacturer of underwater equipment—is vitally interested

in helping in this work. . . and now provides a SCUBA Consultant Service, to help you set up a
course of action to fit your needs. If you are interested in this—mail the coupon for full information.
No obligation . . . service is free.

The Whole Picture
Sirs:

Mr. White’s “Critique 011 Recrea-
fion” [November] is an article that re-
quires issue with his basic concepts
more so than his “challenging state-
mcnt.” The fact that Life and Fortune
magazines record billions spent on pur-
suits other than community recreation
does not make the efforts of organized
recreation “relatively limited.” More-
over, it does not present the gloomy pic-
ture outlined by the author. I wonder,
does Professor White have any concept
of how much is spent annually for rec-
reation by federal agencies, states, coun-
ties, municipalities, church groups, fra-
ternal organizations, scouts, Y’s, civic
groups—semi-public, private, semi-pri-
vate———and schools?

Concerning his thoughts on commer-
cial recreation versus community rec-
reation, both have in a way been re-
sponsible for each other’s growth. Ice
rinks, marinas, and golf courses are but
a few examples. I am convinced he had
tongue in cheek when he suggested that
municipalities undertake private enter-
prise to support their programs. If it
were legal, which it is not in most states,
I would suggest “blue chip stocks,” not
bowling alleys, as an investment.

A good community program (should
include all private recreation agencies
as well as public) will more than pay
l or itself, not in dollars and cents as is
required by commercial intrests, but in
the intangibles and personal services
that Americans demand and require.

Lest anyone conclude that efforts ex-
pended in community recreation are so
minor in public interest that they can be
disregarded, let them question their
mayor, community chest chairman, city
manager or councilman on what re-
quests he has had lately for new recre-
ation services or facilities.

Mr. White is to be congratulated on
a provocative article; however, his con-
clusions are not as obvious as he may
believe . . . merely false assumptions.

Let’s practice what Mr. ( Critique on

the best suggestion that I have read in

Gokarts: Pro and Con

Sirs:

As the principal of an elementary
school, a former teacher and recreation
director, I strongly support the idea
that racing in a motor-driven vehicle is
undesirable for youth under legal age.
Not only is it hazardous and too com-
petitive but it keeps the participants
from taking part in more active sports.
Surely our President in his physical ht-
ness program has pointed the way to
the development of strong Americans.
Do we not owe it to our youth to help
them choose the recreation which will
build strong bodies? Are we not obli-
gated to help them select activities
which are not so dangerous?

RUTH HIGGINS, Principal, Nannie Lee

Frayser School, Louisville, Kentucky.

*3? * it *

Once again one of our national or-
ganizations is speaking on behalf of all
the people . . . . The National Congress
of Parents and Teachers has issued the
statement registering disapproval of go-
kart racinG. The reasoning is that it is
too competitive for the emotional ma-
turity of children and physically haz-
ardous. I wonder if these well-meaning
leaders have policed their national or-
ganizations, of which I have been an
active member for twelve years, or are

simple as we are trying to impress on
our children. Who knows at What hour
the world might be turned into chaos,
leaving our young ones to make their
own way, scrambling for food, shelter,
even their own existence? It is time we
start impressing 011 our children and
adults that life in its entirety is competi-
tive.

We fight disease, we compete in
school for grades, for positions on ball
teams, school plays, etcetera. 0n gradu-

and positions in life. It is time we in
America got off our big fat overstuffed
chairs and started educating ourselves
and our children in the facts of life. We
hear the clamor to stop high school
football, baseball, etcetera because of
dcaths. I have yet to hear any of our
people in top positions say to stop driv-
ing cars, where the deaths are appalling,
or to stop riding bicycles, boats, skis,
etcetera, where there are also many
deaths. I say let’s teach‘the children
how to protect themselves; teach them
what competition is, provide proper su-

country something to' fight for and a
will to fight.

I have worked with children as a
teacher and a principal for over thirty
years and during part of that time I
have worked actively with the National
Safety Council in its efforts to educate
children and parents to live safely and
wisely in a world which presents many
natural hazards as well as too many
man-made hazards created by those who
exploit children for profit or for projec-
tion of “unmet” needs of adults. The
gokart is an example of this kind of
overzealous and unsafe offcring to
young children. I personally hope that
the efforts of the National Congress of

in pointing up the dangers inherent in
this activity.

was carefully considered and was madc
only after an extensive survey of the '
disastrous results of little children

the “push” or pedal type sidewalk
vehicle is the kind that should be used
by children below the drive licensing
age. Even though motor-driven gokarts
are used on off-the-street areas, they
are too hazardous for youngsters. Let’s

Upgrade the Profession
Sirs:

Mr. Hill’s letter to the editor [on rec-
reation personnel] in the November
1961 issue expresses the opinion of
practically every large municipal rec-
reation department which employs pro-
fessionally trained face-to-face leaders.
His two proposals, no doubt, have al-
ready been made by many recreation
associates. I helieve it is most impor—
tant that we assemhle the factual data
of the many cities throughout the nation
so that we may improve the recreation
picture just as the nation has improved
the profcssional teaching horizon.

We, in Los Angeles, have made many
studies together with other recrcation
surveys and believe this will lead to an
improvement in the economic oppor-
tunities and social status of professional
rccreation lcaders. It is important that
recreation administrators he informed
that standards must include not only
performance and educational experi-
ence but there must be economic status
for professional recreation leadcrs. I
therefore suggest that those who are in-
terested in this broad survey take the
initiative and do something to upgrade
our profession.

I should like to hear from as many
interested persons as wish to write re-
garding conditions affecting qualified
recreation leadcrs. Address replies to

MY
PHILOSOPHY
OF RECREATION

Julian \V. Smith

THE CHANGING SCENE of living makes

it necessary to translate time-used
concepts into ideas and words that fit
into the context of our current society.
While certain basic principles relating
to human behavior remain constant,
many of the patterns of living become
obsolete and are replaced by others
which reflect the social, economic, and political setting of

 

a given period.

Recreation, increasingly important in our times, needs to
have a philosophical basis which has meaning and applica-
tion for this century. What has been called recreation and
leisure time are examples of currently used terms which have
their roots in the past and now need to be re-thought and
clarified. The Greeks, several centuries prior to the birth
of Christ, had a concept of recreation which is more appli-
cable to our day than that which prevailed in the interven-
ing centuries. To describe a philosophy of recreation, one
is faced with the alternatives of finding different words
which have more meaning today or in placing a modern
interpretation on terms and concepts which were used in an
earlier period. What often results is a combination of both,
which makes it even more difficult to understand the signifi-
cance of recreation. A brief look at some of the changes in
society will help understand the philosophy of recreation as
set forth here.

The reversal of the amount of time in the last hundred
years devoted to earning a living as compared to that which
millions of Americans call their free or released time now is
an important factor in the changing concept of recreation.
The difference in the nature of labor occurring during the
hundred-year period, the drift to cities and automation, and
the higher standard of living for large numbers of our pop-
ulation all have a part in modern thought concerning the
nature and role of recreation. Leisure has been aptly de-
scribed as the time spared from the necessities of life, such
as earning a living, eating and sleeping. Recreation, as we
are beginning to envision it, encompasses the purposeful use
of the hours, days, and weeks at the individual’s disposal
which his forebears may have regarded as “idle time” or
would, with reservations, have labeled “worthy use of lei-

“The potential for the good life
lies within the human heart and mind”

sure.” The puritanical concept of leisure time as idleness
and “tainted with sin” still appears at times, particularly in
legislative halls when laws and funds for recreation are being
considered. Recreation must now be regarded as one of the
necessities of life which has an important bearing on man’s
values.

It has always been the dream of man to have the time and
means to pursue activities of his own choosing in which he
might find satisfactions, adventure, relaxation, and chal-
lenge for himself and his family. American democracy, with
the advantages of abundant rcsources, a system of free edu-
cation, and highly developed industrialization has brought
the goldennage in this regard within reach, but—alas—many
people lack thc skills and appreciations to enter into the
richer life which could‘be theirs. This may well be the great
modern paradox because a society which has freed so many
from long hours of toil has done little to prepare them for
an abundant life. i

A phrase that most nearly embodies this broad concept
of recreation is “creative living.” Dr. Jay B. Nash conceives
of it as an outlet to creativity. Recreation thus defined de-
scribes the potential for man’s endeavors during the newlyr
acquired time at his disposal. While some may find oppor-
tunities for self-expression and creativity in their work, for
most people “the creation and re-creation” of man’s values
will take place during the time freed from life’s demanding
tasks.

THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES that could be labeled “recrea-
tion” are as broad as life itself. What is, or has been,
considered work for some is recreation for others. The
range of pursuits may vary from quiet meditation and read-
ing to mountain climbing and vigorous sports. Relatively
few of life’s most satisfying activities require “being led”
or regimented. To the contrary, the desire, motivation, and
pcrformance coming from within the individual will be ex-
pressed through the hand, mind, and heart. Unfortunately,
recreation has come to mean only “organized” activities to
many people, which may account for part of the lag in good
leadership and adequate facilities.

Recreation has an added challenge and responsibility in
this day of sedentary living: fitness. It is obvious that the
American adult will be more likely to keep fit by participat-
ing in self-directed activities of his clloos‘ing, provided that

AS WE GO TO PRESS

Pnshbntton living has left America “under-exercised as a nation” and
deprived of the “minimum of physical activity essential for healthy
living,” President Kennedy declared at the annual awards dinner of the
National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. The President received
a gold medal for his “dedication to competitive athletics and to Ameri-
can intercollegiate football.” President Kennedy pointed out that “too
many of our children get their exercise from climbing up the seats in
stadiums or from walking across the room to turn on our television sets
. . . we look instead of play; we ride instead of walk. . . . And the remedy,
in my judgment, lies in one direction——-that is in developing programs
for broad participation in exercise by all of young men and women, all
of our boys and girls.” He called upon the nation's community reerca-
tion centers “to provide more opportunities for those who are no longer
attending school . . . to help establish more programs for participation
by American boys and girls, by Americans young and Olt .”

See Pages 26-29 for a documentary view of the wide range
of activities offered by recreation departments.

} MUSEUM CU tATORs are now speaking
boldly of a renaissance of a popular ap-
prcciation of the arts. Rising attendance
figures and new ways to tempt lookers
to become members have swelled mu-

ties have also prospered. Curators hap-
pily report that the public no longer
thinks of museums as repositories of
dead mummies but a lively spot with
dynamic programs.

> THE INCREASING BOREDOM of city life,
the dearth of escape hatches, and virtual
bankruptcy of thinking on how to make
the city more interesting have sped the
trend away from the central urban core,
according to Charles Abrams, a profes-
sor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a Specialist in housing
problems. He addressed the annual con-
ference of the American Institute of
Planners. He declared that the goals of
urban America must relate to human in-
terests and needs as much as to wood
and stone, monumental buildings, huge
parking lots, and refurbished homes.

At the same conference, Norbert Gor-
wic of Wayne State University declared,
“Our whole culture is a culture of cities.
All that is great and lasting in our spir-
itual inheritance has been created in
and by the city. Suburbia has created
produced nothing except snobbery, so-
cial segregation, and economic ego-
tism.”

} SERVICE CHARGE: The Recreation
Personnel Service of the National Rec-

increasing expenses in handling and
mailing personnel credentials for indi-
vidual professional leaders, as well as in
the cost for sending  ob notices to candi-

of the Association are now available for
members only and at the cost of an addi-
tional $5.00 annual charge for “active
personnel listing”: for the maintenance

dentials and the sending of notices of
specific openings. Job listings will no

New Frontiers for Mission 66

 

National Park Director discusses the plan for national parks

which was bold—but not hold enough

Conrad Wirth

F IVE YEARS AGO
the National
Park Service
launched a ten-
year program
called Mission 66
to bring the facil-
ities and services
of the Park System up to a standard
that would meet the requirements of the
times and of the American people.
Mission 66 found- immediate support
in high places of our government and
by the people; and so the program was
launched. We thought we were being
almost too bold. Used to putting patch
upon patch, many of us could not imag-

ine park families living in neat cottages
instead of tent houses, new museums
and visitor centers for the public, and
all the other things that Mission 66
promised. Some felt we were being far
too bold and that our imaginations were
getting away from us. We planned for
ten years—and we did not plan it big
enough.

Five years have passed. Instead of
the urgency being over, we find our-
selves facing a new dimension where
an action program is required which
dwarfs the first five years of Mission 66.
We were once permitted the luxury of
a “time lag” between the recognition
of need and its ultimate realization. But
now we find that we have come close to
our very last chance to round out the
National Park System. There is no time
to hesitate. In fact, as Secretary of the
Interior Udall puts it, “Time is our

enemy.” Unless the American people

can act quickly, they and future gen-
erations will lose forever the Opportu-
nity to save a few remaining remnants
of the natural shoreline, vast wilderness
areas of scenic beauty, and simple open
spaces for men to enjoy.

There is one great difference between
Mission 66 of five years ago and Mission
66 of today. We were pioneers then.
Now we have the company of many
others who must adjust to the challenge
of the 1960’s—the great population
growths and movements, technological
progress at an unheard of rate, new
scientific discoveries, and the conse-
quent sociological advancement that re-
flects our national character in this
small world.

Our national parks can never again
be islands standing isolated and lofty
on the face of the nation. What happens
in national parks results from the same
pressures and changes which shape
every other reserve of scenic, recrea-
tional, scientific, natural, and historic
value. This even extends to privately
owned open spaces such as the timber
holdings of the larger corporations.

The National Park Service program.
as it unfolds, will probably call for as
many as twenty-five new national parks
and a sizable number of new recreation
areas—many of them on reservoirs,
along streams, and on the seashore—to
provide the Opportunity needed espe-
cially by urbanized Americans to secure

healthy, outdoor recreation and inspira-
tion.

MISSION 66 is still the long-range pro-
gram it was before. Its sc0pe is
being widened greatly to meet the exi-
gencies of our rapidly changing times.
We have learned a few things in five
years and can readjust Mission 66 ac-
cordingly. We have also accomplished
a great deal. Our first job was to do
something about the shameful physical
facilities in the parks—the roads, trails,
quarters, comfort stations, camp-
grounds, and all the rest. While much
is still needed, we are “over the hump”
on construction in existing parks and
can now address ourselves to other
things.
More emphasis is going to be put on
staffing in field areas, especially as it

12

relates to the operation of physical fa-
cilities. Staffs have increased, as you
know, to meet new demands, but not
commensurate with them. In the early
days of Mission 66 we had to give some
emphasis to the Washington Regional
and Design OfEce staffs so they could
be tooled up for the work ahead. We
must continue to improve our manage-
ment in order that there is no waste mo-
tion and so the work of our staffs will
be aimed more directly upon things that
count the most. This includes better
training as Park Service people move
up the career ladder. It involves better
evaluation of service people with im-
proved transfer and promotion oppor-
tunities.

The constant flow of unsolicited let-
ters complimenting the service upon its
dedicated rangers, naturalists, and oth-
ers in the field is no accident. Proud
as we may be of the men and women
who wear the National Park Service
uniform, our personnel policies and
procedures must be continually reex-
amined and kept up to date if our tradi-
tional level of service is to remain con-
stant.

NO LONGER can we gamble with the
future as we have in the past,
for, in the accelerating speed of

change, the future is tomorrow and

the past is today.—C.W.

 

The research program continues to
lag. We cannot administer our great
scenic and historic treasures by guess-
work; the results of research must go
to work for us.

THERE ILAS NEVER BEEN a time when
park protection has been so im-
portant. This is no simple matter of pa-
trolling boundaries and keeping down
the number of speeders on park roads.
It is a highly technical, often unappre-
ciated job. We cannot let trends drift
into big problems anymore, such as un-
restricted boating, excess animal p0pu-
lations, and unplanned-for winter use,
to name but a few. In any reappraisal
of Mission 66, the broadest concepts of
park protection becomes one of our
most important goals.
Hand in hand with protection is the
almost insatiable need for a constantly

.r z-

improving, constantly expanding inter-
pretation program. It must never re-
main static. We have not yet begun to
tell that story in its entirety—in the best
way—to the fullest audience. Interpre-
tation is a hallmark of the National
Park Service. We must strengthen it.

Park maintenance is better today
than it has ever been in the history of
the service. Again, we cannot rest on
our laurels. The pressure of people will
increase and we must be wise enough
to plan for it. In addition to this, Mis-
sion 66 has brought many new facilities
to parks which must_ now be maintained.
We must plan to do more maintenance,
do it better, and use every new tech-

nique that we can perfect for this job. .

Over the years, concession operations
have shown continuing improvement.
The concessioners of the National Park
System have shown their faith in the
Service to the extent of about $20,000,-
000 of private capital investments since
the start of Mission 66. This feeling of
cooperation and mutual respect must be
retained and strengthened.

M \NY PEOPLE hold the strong convic-
tion that it is absolutely necessary
for the advancement of free society for
those who make up that free socicty to

appreciate and know what this earth of -
ours means to us; we cannot takc it for

granted. We must understand also, very
clearly, what our forebears have done
to give us this freedom that we have
today. We must learn to understand
and enjoy this hcritage.

We peOple in the United States have
more leisure time than any other people
in the world. We have developed our
high standards because of the inspira-
tion we have gotten from our land. Lei-
sure time and its soul-rewarding bene-
fits is the thing we work for, it is the end
product. If we abuse it, we destroy the
results of our labor and destroy our way
of life in a free democratic nation. We
need park and recreation areas, and we
need the knowledge of how to use them.

The way we use our leisure time will de-
termine the kind of a nation we will
have tomorrow. #

CHARLES ELLIOTT REED,
better known as “Char-
lie Reed,” retired from the
staff of the National Recrea-
tion Association on Decem-
ber 31, 1961. Somehow one
. cannot imagine it; for he has
served the Association for
forty-hve years.

For the past thirty-one years Mr. Reed has held, in
his quiet, statesmanlike manner, the post of manager
of the NRA Field Department. In this official capac-
ity he will be greatly missed by a host of friends in
every state and the Canadian provinces. For the held
and headquarters staff members, the sense of loss is
even more poignant—for they are so accustomed to
gaining inspiration and help through frequent con-
ferences or informal shop talk at his busy desk, set
back in a quiet alcove of the second floor at NRA
headquarters. His gentleness, his easy and effortless
way of pouring oil on troubled waters without seem-
ing to do so, his unruffled disposition, all make him
very “special.”

 

Charlie had a most unusual preparation and back-
ground for his life work. Raised a Hoosier farm boy,
he inherited sound religious convictions, a friendly
and winning personality, a hne sense of humor, and
tolerance of the other fellow’s point of view.

He studied at Wittenberg College, completed his
baccalaureate work in sociology at Indiana Univer-
sity in 1912, and took higher studies at the Chicago
School of Civics and Philanthropy, graduating there
in 1913. This school was later known as the School
of Social Service Administration, University of Chi-
cago. Mr. Reed’s held work training in Chicago with
such agencies as the United Charities, the Juvenile
Protective Association, the Court of Domestic Rela-
tions; his two-year residence and volunteer service
at Chicago Commons; and his three-year service 011
the Subscriptions Investigating Committee of the
Chicago Association of Commerce gave him a broad
understanding of the helds of social work and private
philanthropy.

| JANUARY, 1962

Drawn to the field of public recreation, he joined
the NRA staff in October 1916 and worked for sev-
eral years, except for some time durfng World War
I as an enlisted U. S. Navy man, on the promotion of
comprehensive recreation systems for individual
communities, largely in Michigan and Minnesota.
Following the passage of legislation in Illinois and
Iowa, Mr. Reed headed a promotional campaign in
those states, beginning in 1923, to secure the estab-
lishment of local recreation departments through lo-
cal referendum campaigns for special recreation tax
funds. After a period of service as an NRA district
representative, Charlie was called to headquarters to
help with field administration. Since 1930 he has
served as manager of the NRA Field Department.
His responsibilities have involved not only close
counseling and guidance of a large and devoted field
staff and attendance at countless field conferences
and meetings, but also a continuing liaison with the
Committee on Field Service of the National Social
Welfare Assembly and with the various federal agen-
cies in fields related in part to recreation.

Charlie Reed has a great capacity for quietly get-
ting things done. As field manager he was also re-
sponsible for supervising the work of the Associa-
tion’s Leadership Training Service and its Commu-
nity Recreation Survey and Planning Service. His
field department’s voluminous annual report covers
every phase of the held work and has served the
Association as a year-by-year history of exactly what
has gone on in every part of the country. This un-
published report serves the Association as a source
of trends and challenges in the held of public recrea-
tlon.

The joyful part of this official separation of Char-
lie Reed from his work is that he and Mrs. Reed will
now have time to do things they enjoy. Since both
are home and family people this will mean plenty of
time each year for unhurried visiting with daughter
Jane and her husband Joseph Chandler at Downers
Grove, Illinois, and much time, too, for “just keeping
up the place and the garden”—as any good Hoosier
farm lad is taught to do. #

‘x 71mm THE TIME of written his-
tory the first of the armies to
discover the necessary rela-
tionship between work and recreation
were the Greeks. They were pretty well
sold on the fact that a Greek needed a
strong body to live up to the physical
combat doctrines of his day.

Long before the Greeks came along,
armies and soldiers were trained by
forced physical exercises; but it re-
mained for the Greeks to make it fun,
with games and competition, and make
the building of muscles a thing to be
admired by fellow men. They invented
the Olympic games; they created a civil-
ization that lasted a thousand years and
ruled their world during that time; they
left a heritage in the arts and sciences
which we respect, even in today’s
atomic world. Whether they had so
much recreation they burst into con-
quest, arts, and sciences, I don’t know.
In any event, virtually every military
commander since then has been faced
with the responsibility of keeping his
men healthy and their morale high. It
has become the axiom of leadership.

port Agency at Sandia Base, Albuquer-

Today, we have armies, navies, and
air forces of a size greater than the pop-
ulation of all Greece in its golden age.
We have young Americans serving
around the world under conditions
which were never thought of twenty
years ago. We are taking youngsters
from their homes and making them into
soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen,
when their every instinct cries for peace
and the American heritage of freedom
and free will, as opposed to the disci-
plines of military life. The very disci-
plines we seek so avidly in our men are
too frequently not received in their
homes before they come into the mili-
tary establishment. This is the problcm
today, then, and let’s not fight the prob-
lem. Rather, let us see if there are things
we can do to begin solving some aspects
of the problem.

First, let us realize that we cannot
force servicemen or women to partici-
pate, for very long, in any recreation
program in which they are not inter-
ested. We can, in the name of physical
training, demand certain calisthenics
and conditioning programs to prepare
them, physically, for military duties.
This can be stepped up to a more intense
pace so that, finally, their bodies can
withstand a great deal of physical exer-
tion. I have read many histories which

seem to bear out the fact that man’s
physical abilities go far heyond belief
when they are demanded by the mind
and spirit. The condition of the mind
is of great importance. The mind can
make the body do anything.

Physical training, then, can be com-
pulsory, but it isn’t recreation. Recrea-
tion must be something in which partici-
pation is voluntary and from which the
participant receives more pleasurable
return than from any other possible ac-
tivity offered at the time—recreation is
the opposite of work.

In the peacetime service before
World War II, all the men were volun-
teers, making a long or short career of
the service. Their pay was negligible.
even by the concepts of their day. They
put in a hard physical day in their serv-
icc, and their usual recreation was wait-
ing for the monthly payday on which
they bought their simple needs and then
were broke for another twenty-nine
days.' After their workday, their rec-
reation consisted of troop, company.
squadron, or duty-section baseball us-
ing unit-bought equipment: or a hot
game of checkers, cribbage, or pool in
the company dayroom. Enlisted clubs
and NCO clubs were generally unknown
items. Occasionally, a regimental box-
ing night and a baseball series com-

or Today’s Military Man

“He is completely different from his pre- World War II counterpart”

pleted the recreation program. Some—
times it is luxury to remember such

simple days.

TODAY’S YOUNG SERVICEMAN, drafted
into service, finds himself beside
the career man in a new and confusing
life. His roots are still in his hometown,
and he fervently expects to return there
to resume his civilian career at the end
of his service. Very frequently he is
working alongside men from the other
services, and he does not have the iden-
tity with his troop, company, battery,
squadron, or ship that solved so many
daily problems in the old service. At
most, his professional service duties can
only use him for a specified number of
hours each day. He must sleep, eat, and
take time with normal living duties. All
these added up still leave about six
hours of every day_ free. It is during
those six hours that we are most respon-
sible for the man’s morals, his morale,
and his physical well-being. These hours
are his time—his American-heritage
time-to-himself. There are many things
he can do during these hours to negate
all the other things we are trying to
give him.
Perhaps the answer does not lie in
providing him with every conceivable
automated gadget or activity which he

JANUARY, 1962

can find at a carnival or programs
which appeal to him for a brief and
Heeling time. Perhaps we can never at-
tract the interest of some of our service-
men for the simple reason that they do
not have any practical interest; perhaps
we can never interest some men in com-
petitive sports or others in arts and
crafts.

Are we possibly trying to be all
things to all men?

THE OTHER SIDE of the coin would be

that we can never do enough for
our servicemen. When we see the input
from broken homes and from good
homes for which the boy is homesick
every day to return—and when we see
what happens to kids when they don’t
have enough to (lo—then we wonder if
we do enough. Today’s serviceman is
a completely different man from his
prewar counterpart. I strongly suspect
he had just as much trouble finding
something to occupy his leisure time in
civilian life as he does in the service——-
perhaps more.

Today’s American service recreation
programs are the most highly organ-
ized, staffed, and equipped of any in the
world. Dedicated men and women make
careers of providing libraries, facilities
for almost every imaginable sport: and

the artistic possibilities are almost un-
limited. Competitive activities are pro-
vided on a scale almost unbelievable,
with regional and national meets, and
with recognition. Yet I sometimes won-
der if we are really reaching impor-
tantly into those six hours of off-duty
time and reaching into the minds of our
new servicemen.

A ridiculous story frequently has
enough truth to describe a genuine sit-
uation; for instance, there’s the story
of the two first-grade youngsters talking
in front of thcir school one morning.
“Do you think,” said one, “that the
thermonuclear projectiles will pierce
the heat barrier?” '

“N0,” said the second, “because a
force entering the atmosphere at the re-
quired re-entry speed . . .” and the
school bell rang.

Said the first, “There goes the bell.
darn it. Now we have to go in and string
heads again.”

This points up the basic fact that the
increasing complexity of our military
arsenal has generated the rcquirement
for a new kind of serviceman never
known before. The intelligence and
training levels required of this service-
man are fantastic by previous stand-
ards. By requiring these levels of in-
telligence and training. we inevitany

15

create a sophistication in that lad which
compounds the problem of interesting
him in planned recreation programs.
This fact, in turn, has generated a
requirement for ochers trained in rec-
reation management and part of the
staff of the responsible commanders.
Professionally trained civilian activity
directors are needed as never before.

THE IDEAL recreation oHicer would

know the policies and demands of
his commander and spend his time in
carrying out a flexible program to meet
the situation. He would be a leader of
his civilian program directors, able to
translate their advice and projects into
the plans or programs of the command.
Above all, he would be flexible in his
thinking and approach. There is one
thing constant in life today, and this is
change.

For instance, I, as a military com-
mander, am not interested particularly
in the amount of equipment on hand for
sports if that equipment is heing used
by ten men in a command of four thou-
sand. I would much prefer two thou-
sand men kicking a tin can for an hour
if they were actually enjoying kicking
the can around; if they were getting

ART TEACHES YOUTH many things. It
trains the mind as well as the hand.
It heightens awareness, sharpens obser-
vation, and develops originality. When
a youngster draws a clown standing on
his head, people larger than houses,
trees of a magnificent orange or pink,
he is both having fun and expressing
his own response to his environment.
Creativity, stimulated by youthful art
activities, is vital if society is to meet the
future’s challenges. This fundamental

fresh air, exercise, and letting off steam.

One of the popular activities at all my
bases is the hobby shop automobile re-
pair facilities. Perhaps we should ex~
pand these facilities; perhaps we could
get more people to use them if we ac-
quired an instructor in automatic trans-
missions. These are veryicomplex. We
might have a lot of cars out of order
for a time, but we might have a lot of
good transmission mechanics, too.

However, money and facilities are
mere props for the programs of reach-
ing the serviceman and interesting him
in something that may educate him, im-
prove his mind, exercise his body, and
give him something to hold on to within
his spirit. Leadership is the key.

A great many recreation facilities are
housed in makeshift buildings on our
military bases. For example, a main li-
brary is housed in an old guardhouse.
and a library and service club are
housed in a stable. Arts-and-crafts fa-
cilities are generally housed in build-
ings dating back to World War II, since
these programs did not exist then.

Actually, the housing is not as impor-
tant as the leadership and integrity of
the personnel in the recreation field.

quality, born in all of us but often un-
developed, marks every successful ca-
reer, in the office, laboratory, factory,
or home. As one ten-year-old so aptly
put it, “Art teaches you to think for
yourself.”

Many youth organizations, realizing
the vital role art plays in developing in-
dividual skills and talents, will be cele-
brating Children’s Art Month this
March. Among them are Big Brothers,
Camp Fire Girls, Chamber of Com-

drill instructors. And, by the same
token, I do not believe the erection of
the finest gymnasium in the world will
necessarily cause another boy in my
command to take up baseball. boxing,
or. harbells.

As A COMMANDER, I will never ceasc
to explore the new concepts and
ideas, and to try those which seem
sound for improving my command and
the men in it. I am determined that the
men of my command will have access
to a recreation program that will appeal
to them and interest them in voluntary .
participation. I will not settle for less.
President Kennedy said in his inau-

country rather than what our country
can do for us.” As we go about our daily

why we are on this earth. We are on

country, to work for peace, and to do

tatement of the National Advisory Council to the AF L-CIO Community Services Committee

The Role of Labor in . . .

Organized Community Recreation

This statement was drafted by the National Advisory
Council to the AFL-CIO Community Services Committee
«2nd approved by the council on June 2, 1961. It was ap-
proved by the CSC on October 9, 1961 and by the AFL-CIO

duced for millions of workers the satisfactions they
once received from their labor. The resulting lack of

f I ‘HE INCREASING MECHANIZATION of industry has re-

diversity and the elimination of craftsmanship in so large
a proportion of industry has resulted in unrelieved job mo-
notony for these workers. They must of necessity seek more
of their life satisfactions in alternative ways. We are not
only faced with more leisure time off the job but with a
duller time on the job. The gradual availability of more
leisure time in our society, as differentiated from enforced
idleness, is the result not only of improved productivity
growing out of a constantly improving technology, but from
action taken by those most directly concerned.

Organized labor, through collective bargaining and social
action resulting in needed legislation, has helped to secure.
as benefits of this increased productivity, additional hours
of leisure. Historically, the worker, through his union,
has chosen to take the benefits of technological improve-
ment not only in cents per hour but in additional hours of
leisure. In the past sixty years, this has resulted in a de-
crease of the workweek from sixty to forty hours or less,
more and longer vacations with pay, increase in the number
of paid holidays, and more opportunities for earlier retire-
ment.

More leisure time presents a challenge to all labor to make
considered choices in its use to insure maximum satisfac-
tions and benefits both for itself and for the society of which
it is so substantial a part. More leisure time makes possible
new opportunities for public service, for fuller participation
in the life of the community as well as for recreation. It is
the opportunity offered labor as the result of its increased
leisure time for more and better recreation to which this
statement is addressed.

Because we have not provided the resources which will
enable us to utilize our free time in ways that will yield
lasting rewards in personal and social development, wc are
not now realizing the fullest potential from current leisure
hours. Our ability to realize the full potential has been made
more difficult by the increase in population, growing urban-
ism, increased mobility of the population, the tendency to

JANUARY. 1962

overcrowd the land with the resulting elimination of Open
spaces for public use and the variations within our economy
which has made it difiicult to finance leisure-time programs
on an equitable basis. These factors have made it difficult
to provide adequate services in community recreation. Com-
munity recreation resources including facilities and services
are provided by public agencies, voluntary agencies, labor,
industry, membership groups and commercial interests.
Some of these agencies are concerned exclusively with rec-
reation, others include recreation with other activities and
some are offered for private profit.

L ABOR UNIONS have a responsibility to help mobilize com-

munity recreation resources. The leisure needs of union
members and their families can be met more adequately as
sound, comprehensive community recreation programs are
(lcveloped. Like other members in the community, the union
member generally spends his leisure hours with his family,
friends and neighbors. Even those recreation programs
sponsored directly by the union and limited to the union
membership are sometimes dependent upon the availability
of adequate facilities and trained leadership of public and
voluntary agencies. As a general rule, therefore, it is better
for union members to support public and voluntary agency
programs that provide needed facilities for the total com-
munity.

It is the unions’ belief that government at all levels has
the basic responsibility for meeting the needs of all the peo-
ple for recreation facilities and services; that government
services should be supplemented by voluntary agency pro-
grams and by programs directly sponsored by unions. 0r-
ganized labor’s traditional championship of public recrea- _
[ion is a matter of record.

Unions support public recreation programs at the local.
state, and federal levels through the support of desirable
legislation, referendum proposals, budget appropriations
and accepted standards for areas and facilities, financing,
personnel, program and administration. Organized labor is
also committed to support full participation in all public
programs by all the people regardless of age, sex, race, re-
ligion, national origin, or economic status. Labor can pro-
vide this support through active participation in campaigns
for public education and action, and through participation
on policy-making boards and program-planning committees.

Unions havc the opportunity and responsibility to support
and strengthen voluntary agency recreation programs by
contributing to their financial support, by participating in

ENERALLY ACCEPTED by most public
G recreation agencies is the concept
they have a reSponsibility to serve all
persons of all ages in all parts of the
community. Most public recreation
agcncies fall far short of meeting this
responsibility, particularly for teenage
youth and, more particularly, for the
older teenage youth. Usually, considerably less than half of

 

the teenage youth in a community engage in supervised pub-
lic recreation programs even once a year.

This conclusion is reached after examining some twenty
thousand leisure-time questionnaires administered to junior
and senior high-school students in some twenty different
Wisconsin communities over a five-year period of time.
Even more important, it is probable most public recreation
agencies fail to reach the so called “hard—to-serve youth”
who well may need the services of the public recreation
agency the most.

Public recreation agencies have at least two alternatives:

0 To continue to say that public recreation has no respon-
sibility for the prevention of uvenile delinquency pardon
the dirty words) or

0 To acknowledge that recreation leaders everywhere are

Unacceptable:

in a particularly strategic position to identify youth with
problems and they do have a reSponsibility to make proper
referrals of these youth to agencies who can be of assistance.

May I further point out that the rules and regulations of
the agencies frequently prohibit eflcctive contact with these
youth. For example, one large Midwest city has a hoard
rule which on pain of dismissal prohihits rccreation person-
nel from leaving city-owned property (playground or park)
while on paid time. This regulation effectively rcstricts thc
leader from “rcaching out” or even going half way to con-
tact hard-to-reach youth playing in the vacant lots adjaccnt
to the playground. Another board of education-adminis-
tered recreation program prohibits the use of schools or
school property (including the fine community center) from
being used by school-age youth during school hours or on
school nights (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day) after 6 PM. Thus the agency imposes a 6 PM recreation
curfew rather than 8 PM or even 10 PM.

HILE IT IS ALWAYS RISKY to develop prototypes, let us
now examine the case of Johnny:

Johnny at eight had already had two years’ expcrience on
the playground swings, slides, and sandhoxes where older
boys (and girls) had chased the “small fry” away from their
facilities (the playground directors were busy supervising
the ball games and swimming pool). When Johnny was old
enough for cub scouts, his mother (on relief because her
hushand deserted her or is in an institution or is an alco-

RECREATION

I h'nlic) saved money from the food budget for the registra-
ti )n fee. After two den meetings and one cub-pack meeting
Juhnny is told by the den mother (supported by pack £om-
n ittee and district scout oflice) that he cannot bear cub
s«-out because of the rule that “a cub’s father must attend
p 1ck meetings with the boy.”

Several other boys in Johnny’s neighborhood had had
smilar experiences and this group became his primary
group. He began to experiment in petty thievery and other
: nti-social activities, and when the well-meaning men’s serv-
i:e club presented him with a membership in the‘YMCA
lbut forgot to include cost of towel, soap, and locker fees,
I) say nothing of gym shoes and gym suit and bus fare), he
“ (as caught stealing money from other boys, was rejected

by the agency (and by the YMCA boys) for his behavior.

Similar rejections for approximately the same reasons
ny the Saturday-morning school recreation program and by
..i church young-people’s group set the stage for complete
tntagonism towards society when Johnny and his rejected
riends were picked up by the police department on a charge
of loitering and suSpicion of pilfering in a drugstore. Whilc
the boys had not been pilfering, the police had sound basis
,Ifor their suspicions and, when their investigation revealed
frequent truanCy from school and uncontrollability at home
(late hours and refusal to obey mothers), the boys were la-
beled “had,” placed under the supervision of a probation
officer, and subsequently joined the rest of the community’s
hard-to-serve or hard-to-reach youth who found acceptance.
status, and recognition with youth of their own kind.

Yes, Johnny had been a member of several socially ap-
proved youth-serving organizations. At fourteen his mem-
ory of these experiences was vague and distorted. When
asked he said, “Yeah, I’ve been kicked out of better clubs
than that.” He found difficulty in admitting he had been
rejected and preferred to claim expulsion with cause.

MIDWEST CITY with over 100,000 population faced up to

this problem. Its citizens had become concerned over
the apparent failure of its leisure-time and youth-serving
agencies to “reach” or to “serve” a large segment of its teen-
age youth who used the brightly lighted commercial recrea-
tion section of the community as their “hangout.” In an ef-
fort to accumulate more information about “hard-to-reach”
youth for the purpose of being able to plan to meet their
needs more effectively, a detached worker or street worker
was employed on a part-time basis (twenty hours per week)
for approximately six months. This person, a male, uni-
versity graduate student, with some experience and special
training in working with teenagers was asked to determine
what natural groups of youth could be identified, whether
or not they were engaged in anti-social behavior, where they
congregated, what was the makeup of the grOUps, what was
their interests, activities, and behavior patterns, and to try
to determine what would meet their recreation needs. It was

formation rather than to give service to groups or individu-

establishing relationships and securing reliable information.

JANUARY, 1962

This WORKER’s FINDINGS and conclusions indicates that

this community did not have “gangs” or highly organi
ized groups, organizcd primarily for delinquency parp'oses,
although he did find groups of teenage youth'engaged in ac-
tivities, nonconformist in nature, which frequently resulted
in delinquent acts. He reported that these hard-to-rcach
youth had problems, many of them serious problems beyond
the ability of the youth to solve. He found they rarely seek
out help from agencies capable of helping them, that they
were suspicious, resentful, disappointed, and, in many in-
stances, frightened youth. For the most part there was a
tendency for them to seek out the basic satisfactions of se-
curity, affection, new experience, and status from and with

youth their own age who had similar problems and frustra-
tions.

The community had a bright-light section and it was
agreed that probably most of this community’s hard-to-reach
youth tended to congregate in this particular section of tha
community. The worker spent much of'his time in commer-'
cial recreation establishments, frequenting coffee, popcorn:
hamburger, and root becr stands; restaurants; bowling al-
leys; drugstores; gas stations; and other youth hangouts.
He spent his time talking with and listening to youth, getting
acquainted, hearing about their problems, discussing the
questions they had, and questioning them about their inter-
ests and concerns. He was able to determine that approxi-
mately one hundred youth were seen often enough to know
their names and of this group a sample of forty-five people
was studied more closely.

Information was then obtained about these forty-five (28
boys and 17 girls) from the police department, vocational
school, public school, probation department, and the com-
munity’s social-service exchange to determine the extent to
which the youth and his family was known to the various
social agencies of the community. Information gathered in-
cluded the youth’s age, marital status, living arrangements.
area of residence, school last attended and grade, IQ, and the
number of these youth or their families known to social agen-
cies. Some of the information about this special sample
group is as follows:

0 Only a third of these youth were currently attending
school of any kind.

I Only a third were currently living with both natural par-
ents. Of those who had independent living arrangements :1 '
fifth were under twenty-one, and half of these were seven-
teen or younger.

o The average age was eighteen, the average grade in school
was tenth grade, and the intelligence quotient scores formed
a normal curve for an average, typical population.

0 Seven-ninths of this group had had at least one contact
with the police.

Labeled “bad” by the community, they attempted to live
up to this reputation and to reflect the community’s attitudes
about them back to the community. No existing youth
agency was effectively serving these groups. Membership
and participation in youth-serving agencies was hard to es-
tablish by the worker. Responses such as “Yes, I’ve been
kicked out of that club.” or ridicule were common when the

19

names of various youth-service organizations were men-
tioned. From these youth’s viewpoint the personnel in law
enforcement, social agencies, courts, and the recreation agen-
cies seemed to represent authority and someone they should
resent whether or not they had first-hand experience with
that agency.

Conclusions reached by a citizens’ committee after exam-
ining these and more detailed findings suggest that these
older adolescent problems are so severe and that they are
so socially damaged (at the age of sixteen and seventeen)
as to indicate the usual kind of community recreation pro-
gram will offer little or no help to these hard-to-reach youth.
However, it was concluded that all youth-serving agencies
including the public-recreation agency did have a respon-
sibility in preventing reoccurrence of “hard-to-serve” or
“hard-to-reach” groups. One avenue of “prevention” could
be accomplished, it was felt, by giving increased emphasis
to staff in-service training programs designed to increase
staff ability to understand youth with problems and to rec-
ognize emotional and social maladjustments at an early age
and to deve10p a structure within the agency for the proper
referral of youth with problems to the agency best equipped
to give assistance. A critical reexamination of agency “rea-

policy making and program planning, and by c00perating
in the education of the public about recreational activities.
Unions are doing many other things, too, in recreation. For
example, they sponsor their own programs directly, limited
in some instances to their own memberships and in other
instances Open to the community. Such programs may be
supplementary to other union activities or may be needed
to fill the needs currently unmet by public and voluntary
agency programs.

Unions can provide a service to their members by organ-
izing various recreation activities, stimulating new recrea-
tion interests, informing their members of available commu-
nity recreation resources and developing effective liaison
with public and voluntary agencies in jointly sponsored
activities.

Organized labor has a stake in the protection of existing
recreation areas from unwise encroachment for unrelated
uses, in the conservation of our natural resources, and in
the acquisition of additional recreation areas needed for our
rapidly increasing population and our expanding leisure.
Unions can help to protect public and voluntary agency pro-
grams from undue pressures to levy charges and fees on par-
ticipants to the point where certain economic groups are un-
able to participate because of these fees and charges. Unions
can help to stimulate and support imaginative program plan-
ning so that a broad range of activities are available to meet
the varied leisure-time interest of the people. Organized la-
bor should cooperate with other community groups to pro-
tect public recreation areas, facilities and tax funds from“
exploitation by commercial interests for personal profit.

sons for expulsion” from its activities was suggested.

EFFECTIVE ACTION for public recreation agencies must in-
clude:

o Reexamination of agency policy for exclusion of youth
for infractions of rules and regulations. Alert staff to find
out “why” did the youth violate rules, indulge in “testing”
or “acting out” behavior.

0 Staff training aimed at helping staff understand that ex-
pulsion of a youth is also an admission of staff failure to
cope with a situation (or to understand the motives of the
youth involved) and to understand “why” the act was com-
mitted without condoning the action.

0 Reexamination of agency rules and regulations which pro-
hibit recreation staff from “reaching out” to contact hard-to-
reach youth and which exclude youth from program.

0 Establishing working relationships with community agen-
cies and staff who are also working with and concerned
about these youth (child-guidance clinics, social-work agen-
cies, school guidance staff, police and juvenile court offi-
cials) to facilitate easy referral of youth to these agencies
and to enable these agencies to make appropriate referrals
to the recreation staff. #

Effective social action is necessary, beginning with the
local community and extending through the federal level.
Local and state central bodies and national and international
unions should review the problems of recrcation and lcgis-
lation as they pertain to their members and families and to
the general public and establish appropriate machinery for
effective action.

Labor can be a powerful influence in shaping leisure-time
programs and insuring the facilities required by thcm to the
extent that its membership is informed. is interested and will
support the action called for. #

Fitness Frontiers
There were no flabby Americans at

the Highline Summer Gym Camp at
Camp Waskowitz in North Bend, Wash-
ington. Youngsters from eight through
high-school age worked at building
muscles in a simulated replay of the
Rome Olympiad. Flags of thirteen na-
tions were displayed. “Yoomp, yoomp,”
boomed Swedish-accented Inga-Liza
Franzon, Seattle Pacific College physi-
cal education instructor, at morning
calisthenics, and the youngsters
“yoomped.” Physical education in-
structors and athletic aces are grooming
these American youngsters to physical
fitness with an eye out for future Olym-
pics stars.

In Newton, Connecticut, 710 students
received fitness certificates from the
Junior Chamber of Commerce. The
youngsters qualified on the basis of the
AAU Junior Physical Fitness and Pro-
ficiency Test. The number of students
qualifying increased from 599 in 1957.
The Junior Chamber of Commerce in
Newton also sponsored 3 “Continuous
Hiking Day” which sent seven different
groups of parents and children on hikes
ranging from one to five miles.

Hydraulic Fitness
Twenty children, products of two am-

bitious recreation programs conducted
each summer by the Los Angeles
County Department of Parks and Rec-
reation, participated in a special event
during National Physical Fitness Day,
in May, at the Los Angeles Police Acad-
emy in Elysian Park, Los Angeles. In
order to spotlight constant effort by the
county department to raise the stand-
ards of children’s physical fitness, offi-
cials arranged for children to demon-
strate what they learned last summer in
the Los Angeles County Junior Life-
guard and Junior Frogman courses.
Ten children. between the ages of ten

and fourteen began their portion of the
program with a demonstration of skills
learned in the frogman course. Ten
graduates of the Junior Lifeguard pro-
gram followed with a quarter-hour dem-
onstration of their new skills. The Jun-
ior Frogmen did surface dives, recov-
ered objects from the bottom of the
swimming pool, demonstrated under-

 

water swimming strokes, and competed
in a timed underwater rescue. Uni-
formed Junior Lifeguards presented a
quick series of activities illustrating the
lifesaving skills learned in their pro-
gram.

“We are particularly pleased with the
manner in which youngsters through-
out the county have responded to the
two programs,” says Norman S. John-
son, county parks and recreation direc-
tor. “I am confident that each child
who went through the program not
only benefited physically, but learned
many new things that will add to his
appreciation of life and the importance
of physical fitness.”

Mobile Pools
A new project sponsored by the East-

ern Union County YMCA brought the
pool to the public in Linden, New Jer-
sey. Twenty-five children were the first
to use the mobile pool which is the prin-
ciple attraction of a Funmobile. The
pool is mounted on a flat trailer, made
of structural steel and marine plywood
and lined with plastic. It is twenty feet

 
 

long and forty inches deep. The pro-
gram aims to teach children to swim

and to increase physical fitness.

Gold Bush
A gilt-edged idea for killing two birds

' with a “gold” nugget comes from Pat-

terson Park Recreation Center in Balti-
more, Maryland. A rock-collecting con-
test was held and certificates presented
to the youngsters collecting the most
stones. Then the rocks were painted
with gold paint and stored in anticipa-
tion of “The Gold Rush” when children
brought paper bags to the playground
and searched for the hidden gold. The
gold rocks were then collected and
weighed in on a kitchen scale and cer-
tificates presented to the most persistent
miners. The result, reports Virginia S.
Baker, center director, is very, very fcw
broken windows and more rock-collect-
ing contests.

Space Race

If you get a reply from an outer
spaceman, it’s A-Okay! In Montclair,
New Jersey, a space race was sponsored
by thc recreation department and the
Keep Montclair Beautiful Committee.
Children paid a nickel, signed a pledge
to help kcep the city litterless and
launched helium-filled balloons. Post-
cards attached to the balloons requcsted
finders of the balloons to fill in informa-
tion about who picked up the balloon
and where.

New Faces at the Zoo
Male zookeepers at thc Central Park

Zoo in New York City had mixed reac-
tions when two female menagerie keep-
ers were added to the staff. The young
women are in charge of the new Chil-

RECREATION

 

clren’s Zoo. Until now, women have
worked as attendants for visitors, but
never have been in charge of cages.
Menagerie keeping calls for strongarm
tactics, is definitely not for the weak
of arm. The staff of the zoo looked at
the two new arrivals with different eyes
when they saw them at work lifting and
cleaning.

Turtle Happy

Saturday mornings in the House of
Refuge Museum in Stuart, Florida, is
the time for all good volunteers to come
to the aid of the turtles. The museum
' asks for volunteers to bring old tooth-
brushes to help take algae off the backs
of the museum’s two hundred baby
turtles.

Trailblazing the Long Path
New Yorkers with a yen to hike have

four hundred miles to do it in. The
Long Path trail extending from the New
Jersey side of the George Washington
Bridge to Whiteface Mountain in the
Adirondacks was recently marked out.
Trailblazers have gone modern, using
sky-blue paint and signs reading “Long
Path” or little aluminum markers bear-
ing the initials L.P. instead of the tra-
ditional tree-whacking trail marks.

Catch a Hobby by the Tail

A hobby can swim away with you, a
group of skin divers has discovered. A
band of fish watchers has organized to
study the migration, population, and
behavior of salt water fish. The Ameri-
can Littoral Society was formed at
Sandy Hook, New Jersey, when skin
divers, tired of” spearing fish, sought a
more scholarly outlet. They embarked
upon their new project after having

Sharing the Wealth ‘

“Farmers and other private land-
owners can help meet an important rec-
reation need by opening their lands to
the camping public,” Rea Agnew, ex-
ecutive in the Camping Council, re-
ported at a recent conference of land-
owners and Camping Council top brass.
A new era is opening in outdoor recrea-
tion with provision of parklike areas

and camping facilities for families on
private land.

Throttles Away
Model train races for youngsters six—

tecn years old and under are a big at-
traction in York, Pennsylvania. An an-
nual contest is sponsored by the York
Recreation Commission and the Junior
Chamber of Commerce. Prizes are
awarded, including a grand trophy
which must be won by the same indi-
vidual three times before it becomes a
permanent possession. “Don’t put your
train away after Christmas,” say the

sponsors, “enter the model railroad
races.”

Fallow Pasture
Put out to pasture, many people find

retirement to be a fallow field. The
knowledge those years can be the most
meaningful in a person’s life belongs to
the happy retirees who know the ful-
filment of time. When Gilbert C. New-
man, a former Akron, Ohio, tire builder
retired, he began to coach weightlifting
classes at Central State College in
Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Mr. New-
man, who has never accepted remunera-
tion for his work, says coaching has
been his hobby for forty years. Some of
the young men he has coached have

paints as a hobby and recently received
an honorable mention in the amateur
division of the fall art festival in his
community. He was asked to present
a one-man show later in the season.
Bird watching and small game hunting

tired man.

In Honolulu, retirees also seem to be
getting a lion’s share of fun. When
retiree Karl W. Green, voluntecr cura-
tor of the Children’s Museum for almost
a decade, recently had to give up his
work because of health, thc museum
was apprehensive about obtaining a
man to fill the post. But a young re-
tiree who, according to thc Honolulu
Recreation Department, “puts new life
into the project” stepped right up and
into Mr. Green’s shoes. He is Com-
n1ander William H. Christensen, retircd
from the U.S. Navy. The commander
majored in zoology and botany and has
an excellent avocational background in
amateur malacology (the study of mo]—

lusks) .

Civic League, decided to interest mem-

bers and other townsfolk in an idea: to
build a cement slab 80-by-100 feet, so

that the town could have a place at
which to roller skate, play tennis,
square dance, give band concerts, hold
picnics, and plan community gather-
ings. The fire department provided
acreage as a site for the slab. The fi-
nance chairman needed $1,000 for ex-
penses and, with everybody pitching in.
old and young, including high school
children, local businessmen, etcetera,
the money was raised. Civic League
members planted grass around the con-
struction and built fireplaces. The city
fathers gave the restrooms. Much of
the material and most of the work was
donated. The community is proud of
a joint effort. Would that every town
had such a great-grandmother!

Chemist with a horn helps teenagers hit a high note

THE MAJOR MINORS SWING IT

WING TROMBONIST Harold 1.. Di-
8 mond. an organic chemist for the
Gulf Research 81 Deve10pment
Company in Harmarville, Pennsylva-
nia, spends his days helping the oil com-
pany find new uses for its products, and
his nights helping teenagers learn how
to play a hot horn. Dr. Dimond is one
of three adults "heading 3 project de-
signed to give talented teenagers an op-
portunity to learn and play good music
under professional guidance.

The instrument for this singular ex-
periment in youth activities is Major
Minors, a modern swing band of fifteen
North Hills high-schoolers led by three
adults. This orchestra combines the
talents of top professionals with the po-
tentially great music stars of tomorrow.

Formed by a trumpet-playing insur-
ance man, John Harris, a former Glenn
Miller bandsman, the Major Minors
have become one of Pittsburgh’s fore-
most swing groups. The music is that
of traditional big “name” bands, now
being rediscovered by a new generation
of youngsters who play old standbys.

JANUARY. 1962

such as “Leapfrog,” “I’m Getting Senti-
mental Over You,” and “Deep Purple.”
The teenage orchestra has appeared on
nearly every Pittsburgh TV station, has
played for innumerable high-school
proms, and has raised more than $7,000
for various charities. Last year, five
Major Minors won coveted “chairs” in
Carnegie Institute of Technology’s H011-
ors Band, an orchestra made up of the
district’s best amateur musicians.
How did an organic chemist get in-
volved with a swing band? Dr. Dimond
first learned of the Major Minors, then
called the Little League Swing Band,
by reading a newspaper feature story
about businessman-trumpeter John
Harris. Although band activities cut a
swathe through his Spare time, Harold
Dimond wouldn’t give up his seat in the
trombone section for anything. “I get
a lot of satisfaction helping them out;
besides, it keeps me from getting rusty,”
he says, “the band gives the kids an op-
portunity that was never open to me. It

also teaches them courtesy toward each
other, cooperation, and discipline.”

Membership in the Major Minors is
a much sought-after goal among area
high-schoolers. To merit the profes-
sional training received, players have to
pay strict attention to the work at hand.
“There’s no monkey business at re-
hearsals,” Dr. Dimond points out.
“Strict discipline is enforced. We prac-
tice for several hours each Monday eve-
ning at the Bradford Woods Elementary
School, and a youth must account for
any absence. Weak excuses aren’t tol-
erated. If a youngster is not sincerely-.
interested in playing, there are many
replacements eager to take his place.

“Since we’re not subsidized, John
Harris always ends up buying the mu-
sic. I have to spend many extra hours
building trombone and trumpet stands.
Moreover, we often provide transporta-
tion for the youngsters to and from re-
hearsals since many are below driving
age.

“Certainly,” muses Dr. Dimond, “on
stage, such minor problems are all
washed away and forgotten. . . . When
they play, they’re really with it!” if:

FITNESS ACTIVITIES

IN RECREA T I ON

26

I : YER SINCE 1955, when the results of

the Kra us-Weber 'l‘est show ed

that European youngsters far outranked children in the United

States in certain minimum muscular fitness tests. youth fitness
has been given high priority in the national fitness program. Efforts
to promote youth fitness were and are being encouraged and urged
from the top level of government, first by President Eisenhower and

now by President Kennedy. whose belief

 

is expressed by his statement,
“Fitness can keep us strong."

It is understandable that
much of the past and present
efforts for fitness haVe been
directed toward working
through the field of physical
education in the schools.
Here it is possible to give
local tests and to stcp up thc
prescribed gym and playfield
programs through required
classes.

The conccrn at top lcvel
focused the attention of the
z\merican public on the un-
deniable fact that physical
education programs in many
elementary schools were in
need of upgrading; that all
too many junior and senior
schools were ill-equipped to
provide adequate play space
and trained leadership; and
that current sports programs
were all-too-often limited to
the small group of youngsters
who “made the team,” leav-

ing the others to act as spec-

tators to a few major team sports: baseball, football, and basketball.

It was during that time, too, that the youth-serving agencies, includ-
ing not only public recreation agencies but private agencies as well,
took a look at their programs and realized the importance of stepping
up their physical recreation activities and strengthening their out-of-

school opportunities for boys and girls.

The Youth Fitness Committee of the National Recreation Associa-
tiun’s 1National Advisory Committee on Recreation Programs and
Activities encouraged such efforts in its widely distributed pamphlet.
Youth Fitness, A Community Responsibility, issued in 1958.

HERE DO WE STAND TODAY? Has public recreation proved that it
has a real place in the youth fitness program? Is it accepting its
potential role? What does it have to offer over and beyond the school
physical-education program? What does it offer to the boys and girls
who, for any number of reasons, do not take part in the Big Four—
baseball, softball, basketball, and football? In order to answer these
questions, the Youth Fitness Committee asked its members for photo-
graphs of current physical activities, a few of which are shown here.
An out-of-school recreation program offers free choice and volun-
tary participation. It is not a required subject needing a passing grade.
It is personal. It is fun. Effort + Interest 2 Youth Fitness—we happy
equation! Hiking, for example, in terms of physical fitness might be
an excellent means of developing leg muscles. To the youngster, hiking
is the way to get to a camp site or other destination. His leg muscles
will take care of themselves!

Does it necessarily follow, however, that providing active games and
sports in the out-of-school recreation program will automatically re-
sult in physical fitness? Not necessarily, to any appreciable degree,
unless recreation leaders understand, use, and insist upon adequate
standards of performance. If hiking is to be of value in developing
endurance, and strengthening backs and leg muscles it requires knowl-
edge of how to walk correctly—something many youngsters do not
know. It requires a time limit, an adequate speed, a rhythmic stride.
It requires wise selection of distance to suit the degree of competence
of the group. Many a child has given hiking a black mark because he
was taken too far too soon.

Physical fitness is not a “sometime thing.” A Fitness Day held
once a summer is no answer. Fitness demands constant attention, regu-
lar participation, the opportunity to progress in skill development. It
means a constant state of awareness of the individual needs of the
individual child.

Alec Smith, chairman of the National Recreation Association Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Recreation Programs and Activities,
and superintendent of recreation in Palo Alto, sums up the opinion of
recreation departments when he says, “Every boy and girl needs suHi-
cient muscular strength to maintain good posture at rest and in motion
and to do with ease the tasks of the day. He needs strength and en-
durance to persist in work and play without undue fatigue. Skills
learned in a variety of activities will serve throughout life as safety
valves for relieving the pressures of high-tension living and as re-
sources for the constructive use of leisure.” #

HE PAST ONE°AND-A-HALF DECADES

have been a time of greatly ex-

panded general, informal activity
in conservation education by govern-
ment agencies and the multitude of citi-
zen organizations in one way or another
active in conservation. We can point
with pride to growing society member-
ships, new publications and films, in-
creased use of television and other mass
media, and a host of camps, workshops,
training schools, interpretive services
and museum programs that did not exist
fifteen years ago. However, there is
critical need for an evaluation of these
programs. Let us examine the duplica-
tion of effort, failure to base programs
on the most up-to-date research find-
ings, inadequate jobs of selecting and
training instructors and lay leaders, use
of outdated materials, and reliance on
emotional approaches.

True, the last fifteen years have wit-
nessed both growth and innovation in

the comparatively new graduateolevel
integrated curricula available at the
University of Michigan, University of
Colorado, Ohio State, Cornell, and else-
where represent an especially needed
and refreshing development. General
offerings in natural resources conser-
vation have sprung up in many colleges
and universities; and in some states,
real progress is being made in teaching
conservation principles in a variety of
courses in the public schools. This does
represent a start, but it is only that; we
have a way to go, especially in teacher
training and doing more with this sub-
ject in our schools.

WITH THE TIDE of interest in open

space problems now running so
high in and around our urban centers,
some might be inclined to score a vic-
tory for conservation education. It is
not possible to assess the effects of edu-
cation efforts in this phenomenon, but
conservation education can be given
relatively little credit in bringing the
wave to a crest. Certainly, however, the
conservationists’ persistent attention to
open-space problems over the years was
responsible for setting it in motion.
What we are witnessing, first in New
York, and now elsewhere, is strong ex-
ecutive leadership coming at a time of
urgent need, substantially aided by an
exceptionally favorable press, and hard.

EDUCATION

and the

OPEN SPACE
PROBLEM

Conservation education faces
a challenging coming of age

hitting campaigns of interested organi-
zations.

Since it is impossible to push some.
thing that’s moving faster than you are,
the very rapid pace of developments in
the open space quest might tend to frus-
trate some workers in conservation edu-
cation and give them the feeling that
they are being left behind. Actually,
these whirlwinds of present activity are
largely devoted to the absolutely essen-
tial and unpostponablc business of ac-
quiring the last bits of close-in open
space. The educator is not left out;
rather, he is confronted with some of the
greatest challenges ever to arise in con-
servation. We still have not begun to
tackle the many complex aspects of our
outdoor recreation problems; in fact,
most, as yet, are inadequately defined.

One of the diHicult situations facing
us, that spells opportunity for educa-
tion, is the apparently wide discrepan-
cies that exist in the feeling of concern
and urgency for open space problems.
We must help communities to recognize
their needs for open space and to show
them how to profit from the experience
of areas that have postponed attention
to the problem.

ANOTHER CHALLENGE is the often
subtle, yet increasingly important,
matter of competition among outdoor

and an industrial plant

N INDUSTRY and the community in
A which it is located benefit mu-
tually fro’m friendly cooperation
in the field of recreation. A good case
in point is the recreation program of
the Rocketdyne division of North
American Aviation, Inc. at its plant in
Neosho, Missouri.

Rocketdyne, like the other divisions of
North American, supports a recreation
and welfare program with proceeds
from candy, coffee, and cigarette ma-
chines. When thc. Neosho plant was
established in 1956, a nonprofit cor-
poration, the Rocketdyne Foundation,

was formed to administer recreation ac-
tivities. Starting from scratch, the foun-
dation confined its first three years’
operations to sponsorship of ball teams,
welfare grants, contributions to depart-
ment activities, etcetera. Arrangements
with the city of Neosho’s recreation de-
partment made available playgrounds
and gymnasiums for baseball, basket-

ball, and volleyball.
By early 1960, the foundation had

accrued enough funds to embark upon a
building program. First move of the
foundation’s board of directors was to
contact the city planning commission,
outlining plans for a park and recrca-
tion center 'and asking for the city’s
cooperation in providing a suitable lo-
cation.

A fine 36.7-acre site, situated between
the municipal nine-hole golf course and
the city airport, was finally selected.

 

Heavin wooded, the location served
only as a trcacherous rough along one
fairway, although a city archery course
was located just north of the proposed
site. The city council went along, agree-
ing on terms which provide for several
significant advantages to both parties:
0 The annual rental of the city-owned
land was placed at $1000 per year, but
only $36.70 of lhat sum is payable in
cash (one dollar per acre). The re-
mainder might be paid in improvements
to, or maintenance of, the property. The
foundation, in turn, pledged to spend
at least $10,000 in improvements in the
first two years, and at least $15,000 in
the first five years. Improvements over
the $1000 annual figure are credited to
subsequent years.
0 The lease was made on a renewable
basis, with the initial term for ten years.
In effect, the park will belong to the
foundation for as long as Rocketdyne
maintains a production operation in
Newton County, in which Neosho is
located. The plant manufactures large
liquid-propellant rocket engines; its
current products are powerplants for
the Thor and Atlas missiles.
0 Corollary to the above terms was the
provision that should Rocketdyne ever
leave the county, the park improve~

HEN Pennsylvania State Univer-
W sity acquired two tracts of sub-
marginal farmland from the

federal government a half a dozen years
ago they were considered good for noth-
ing except timber. Today they comprise

a major multiple-use development for
recreation, research, and conservation.

The university’s Stone Valley Recre-
ation Area, with a seventy-two acre lake
located on sixty-three hundred acres of
forest land fifteen miles south of the
University Park campus, opened in
April 1961. Original construction of the
lake was financed largely by alumni
gifts and future improvements will de-
pend upon the same source of financial
assistance. This project, as other rec-
reation facilities at the university, will
be self-supporting.

Pennsylvania State University creates a multiple-use area

for recreation and conservation

as essential to the physical welfare of
a student body which by 1970 is ex-
pected to number twenty-five thousand.
Besides, the objective of higher educa-
' tion at the university is to contribute to
the education of the whole person, so
that he may be effective as an individ-
ual, as a participating member of his
family, as a member of his profession,
as one responsible to his community,
his nation, and to mankind.

Farming was the chief occupation of
Stone Valley during the last half of the
19th century. However, as many farm-
ers began to increase the size of their
farms by cultivating the steep hillsides
of their land, the light, silty soil on the
top of these hills eroded severely. Pov-
erty and bankruptcy plagued the area
and in 1934, the United States Resettle-
ment Administration provided assist-
ance to farmers by offering to buy their
farms and/ or by providing better farm-
land elsewhere in exchange for their
property. In 1935 a committee ap-
pointed by the president of the univer-
sity conferred with federal authorities
for the use of the Stone Valley as it
would relate to the university educa-
tional program.’

In 1954, the Stone Valley Tract of
4,614 acres of land, and in 1955 the
Standing Stone Tract of 1,754 acres of
land was deeded to the university by the
federal government. During the winter
of 1957, the assistant dean of the college
of engineering and architecture, drew
up the plans for the construction of the
dam across Shaver Creek. The actual
construction of the dam was started in
June 1957 and it was completed in Jan-
uary 1960.

The estimated cost of developing the
lake was $250,000. The breast of the
earth dam is 240 feet wide at the base,
15 feet wide at the top, and 520 feet
long. The lake is approximately one
thousand feet wide at the widest point,
and about three thousand feet in length

JANUARY, 1962

with a shoreline of about two miles with
a maximum depth of thirty feet. The
lake formed an irregular body of water
adjoining the university’s Mineral In-
dustries, Civil Engineering and For-
estry Camps that had been used for in-
structional purposes. Trees and stumps
were cleared from the dam site, largely
through the efforts of personnel of the
491st Engineering Battalion, a local
Army Reserve unit. Fraternity and so-
rority groups also helped clear the area

of debris.

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT Eric A. Walk-

er appointed a Stone Valley Forest
Planning Committee to be concerned
with the development of the area, estab-
lishing general policies, and initiating
new projects, together with suggestions
for financing them. He assigned the
management of the recreation facilities
to the dean of the College of Physical
Education and Athletics and the forestry
operations to the director of the School
of Forestry. The committee allocated
575 acres of land in the Stone Valley
Tract for recreation development.

To guide the orderly development of
the recreation area the committee need-
ed a master plan. A graduate student
in the recreation education department
was assigned responsibility to deter-
mine the recreation interests of stu-
dents; to collect information pertaining
to the problems and limitations of the
site; to ascertain the needs in relation
to instruction and research programs to
be offered; to consider the use of the
site by the Continuing Education Con-
ference Center; and finally to provide
recommendations for the development
and operation of the area.

During the spring semester of 1960,
two checklist surveys were distributed
to determine the recreation interests of
students. The men’s group survey was
distributed by the president of each fra-

EADMINISTRATION

 

ternity (52) through the Inter-Frater-
nity Council. The group survey for
women students was conducted with the
cooperation of the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil and included all sororities (25). In-
dependent men and women living in the
residence halls were included in the
study. Combining the results of the in-
dividual and group surveys a total of
1736 persons or approximately twelve
percent of the student body was studied.
The student group interest survey indi-
cated the activities in which fraternities
and sororities were most interested. Ac-
tivities listed in order of their prefer-
ence were:

Swimming Ice Skating
Lodges for Rowboating
Overnight Rifle Shooting
Water Skiing Bicycling
Canoeing Fishing
Tobogganing Target Archery
Sailing Skeet Shooting

Horseback Riding Field Archery
Snow Skiing Trap Shooting

THE COMMITTEE approved a general
master plan for the development of

the area and established the following
objectives:
0 To provide outdoor recreational fa-
cilities for the use and enjoyment of
university students, student groups,
alumni, faculty and staff.
0 To utilize the advantages of the Stone
Valley Recreation Area for appropriate“
academic and research projects.
0 To encourage the use of Stone Valley
and its facilities for student, alumni,
professional and citizen workshops, in-
stitutes, clinics and conferences, with
particular emphasis on recreation, out-
door education, conservation, and
camping.
0 To stimulate an appreciation of out-
door recreation activities and to develop
fundamental skills in outdoor living
through organization, planning, and di-
rection of outdoor activities.

Under the direction of the dean of

33

the College of Physical Education and
Athletics, equipment was purchased and
existing facilities were improved for
recreation. Twenty canoes and fifteen
rowboats were purchased; directional
signs and picnic tables were secured
through the 000peration of the Pennsyl-
vania State Department of Forests and
Waters; parking areas and roads im-
proved; two lodges winterized; utilities
and lavatory installed; twelve tent plat-
forms constructed; eleven cabins com-
pletely equipped; and charcoal grills
placed throughout the picnic area. Also,
two existing camp facilities, one with a
capacity of fifty and the other seventy-
five campers, with large administration
lodge, storage building, and tent areas
were improved. Senior students voted

ponds contributed 8,050 large-mouth
bass and 5,000 bluegills. The United
States Fish and Wildlife Service pro-
vided 15,000 large-mouth bass and
9,200 rainbow trout. The State Fish
Commission approved a special regula-
tion for this area to the effect that there
is no minimum size, no bag limit, and
no closed seasons with the exception of
trout.

When additional funds are available
extensive deveIOpments in the major
day-use facilities will include an eight
hundred foot sandbeach; Open stockade
dressing facility; concession stand; pic-
nic shelters with one to accommodate
two hundred persons; tent camping
areas, boathouse and dock; and an
alumni lodge overlooking the lake.

on a self-supporting basis these service
charges were established: daily student
admission permit per car $.25, others
$.50, or a seasonal permit of $5.00;
boat rental to students $.50 for the first
hour, to others $.75; daily boat launch-
ing permit to students $.50, others $1.00
and seasonal boating permit $5.00 and
$10.00 respectively; daily lodge rental
$15.00 or overnight $25.00; daily resi-
dent camp rental $.50 per camper; and
weekly cabin rental of $25.00. Admis-
sion to the area includes picnicking and
fishing privileges.

his education has included a wide variety of lifelong inter-
ests and skills ( see Pages 26-29).

Some decades before industrialization had its full stride
and when the work week was long and the time for recrea-
tion short, the job of earning a living required more physi-
cal energy. It was during this time that passive recreation
and organized activities constituted a major portion of the
program sponsored by public and private recreation agen-
cies. Coming off the farms, up from the mines, and away
from the trades, many pe0ple sought rest and relaxation
through organized sports and games and social forms of
recreation.

Today, with longer periods of time available and with
paid vacations, neither passive recreation nor organized ac-
tivities can meet all of man’s needs recreation-wise. -The
tensions and complexities of city and suburban living and
routinization of much of work creates a great demand for
self-propelled and self-directed recreation activities, some of
which lend themselves to solitude. The great surge of inter-
est in all forms of outdoor activities is illustrative of the de-
sire to “escape” from mechanized living and return to the
open spaces.

without reference to education, which has a major re-
sponsibility to bring the good life within the grasp of every

individual and establish within the human mind a rational
basis for making choices concerning his life endeavors and
pursuits. Recreation thus conceived is inseparable from ed-
ucation and to make creative living a reality for increasing
millions of people will require the combined efforts of all
community education and recreation agencies and organiza-
tions. The emerging community school, serving the broad
education needs of all, and cooperating with other agen-
cies, brings education and recreation into a sharper focus.
The school with its many resources should provide basic
learning opportunities for children, youth and adults; use
its facilities for participation; and serve as a motivating
force for action in the development of a “community cur-
riculum.” This assumption of responsibility by the school
will enable the other community agencies to provide facili-
ties and leadership sufficient to extend the opportunities for
all to pursue their recreation interests and skills thus ac-
quired through the community’s educational system.

The potential for the good life, of which constructive use
of time is a part, lies within the human heart and mind. So-
ciety should provide the environment for the creative expres-
sion of all its pe0ple. The good and ills of the world come
out of the time during which the individual can make his
own choices as to its use. If he lives healthfully, mentally
and physically, seeks for self-improvement, enjoys the best
of the culture of mankind, is imbued with the spirit of com-
munity service and finds some of the “great good places”
for the mind and soul, he will have come into possession of
the heritage of creative living in a free society. #

FLORIDA. The state has more fishing piers than any

other state, and it goes without saying, more pier fishermen
than any other. Pier fishing is not costly, and many of the
piers are open without charge to the angler. Less than a
dollar invested at most of them includes bait and permission
to fish to your heart’s content, and nobody angling in salt
water needs a license. One of the newest on F lorida’s East
Coast is the 1,200-foot New J ax Beach Pier at Jacksonville
Beach. The giant pier at Naples on Florida’s Gulf Coast
was destroyed by Hurricane Donna last year, but has now
been rebuilt and is again in the fishing business.

ILLINOIS. In Chicago, the towers of a $36,000,000 circu-
lar city-within-a-city loom above a 3.1-acre site on the north
bank of the Chicago
River, ust north of the
“Loop.” This Marina
City project, sponsored
by the Building Service
E mployees Interna-
tional Union, repre-
sents not only an im-
portant advance in ar-
chitecture and concrete
engineering, but also a
new concept in urban
living. Two circular,
six-story, reinforced-
concrete apartment
towers represent the
core of the “city.”
Along with this hous-
ing, a wide range of
recreation and com-
mercial facilities is provided. It is a return to the time when
men not only worked but lived in the downtown area. The
site occupies what was known as Block Number One in the
original town of Chicago. In effect, Chicago was born on
this site one hundred and fifty years ago, just two blocks
west of historic Fort Dearborn where the garrison was mas-
sacred by Indians in 1812.

The union bought the 3.1-acre site for nearly $3,000,000
from the Chicago and North Western Railway. This is the

biggest private single land transaction in metropolitan Chi-
cago’s history. In addition to 896 apartment units, each
room with a curved private balcony, the Marina City com-
plex offers year-round swimming and iceskating; a health
club and gymnasium; 54 lanes for bowling; a 1250-seat
theatre; a plaza for shops and parks; and 12,000 square feet
of auditorium space; and, of course, a marina with slips to
accommodate seven hundred boats.

MISSOURI. St. Louis expects its $1,200,000 planctarium

to be open sometime next fall. Located on a gradual rise
near the southern extremity of Forest Park, the building can
he seen at great distances from all directions. Thc thin-
shell concrete structure is a hyperboloid of one sheet, dcm-
onstrating symbolically its content and function. The form
is defined by a vertical axis around which a straight line
revolves, maintaining a constant angle to the axis. The lower
end describes a circle which forms the plan outline; the
upper end of the building describes a smaller circle. The
structure thus appears to be a hyperbola in silhouette, which
rises off the ground on equally spaced pillars running around
the perimeter of the building.

 

The heart of the planetarium is a dome, invisible from the
outside of the building. The interior of the dome, con-
structed of perforated aluminum, serves as a projection
surface for a facsimile of the celestial universe. The dome
encloses 420 individual seats for spectators to view all of the
projected phenomena. The projection instrument will em-
ploy over one hundred projectors to demonstrate all of the
stars and planets which are visible to the unaided eye. The
nocturnal heavens will be shown as they appear from any
place on the earth, and at any time of the earth’s history;
past, present, and future. The instrument also projects the
coordinates used by astronomers and navigators, schematic
diagrams of the constellations, artificial satellites, a view of
the earth as seen from an artificial satellite, and a view of
the solar system from a point external to the earth. The
inside of the dome has a skyline of St. Louis, viewed from
the planetarium site. The presentation of the programs in
the projection auditorium will be further enhanced by a
high-fidelity stereophonic sound system.

The top of the building, reached by a ramp running
around the outside surface of the dome, will serve as an ob-
servation deck, some sixty-five feet from the ground. The
circular upper ledge of the hyperbola will function as a light
shield, protecting the observer from the distracting lights of

graphic instruments will be installed on the observation
deck for general public use.

The basement floor provides for more exhibition space
which, in addition to the area on the first floor, gives the
St. Louis Planetarium the largest exhibition and display area
of any planetarium now in existence. The basement also
contains offices, a lecture room, facilities for classes and
informal lectures, a metal and woodworking shop, provi-
sion for amateur telescope makers, a darkroom, and a
library, all of which surround the downstairs display area.

 

The entire structure rests on a square, paved platform,
creating a plaza, which is shaded by a number of mature
trees. A parking lot, accommodating over two hundrcd ca rs,
is located to the west of the building. A wide, trec-lined
drive leads up to the site, affording an unobstructed view

of the building.

Charles Schweighauser will manage the planetarium for
the St. Louis Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry.
The McDonald Corporation donated $200,000 for the plan-
etarium to supplement the $1,000,000 provided in the de-
partment’s 1955 bond issue.

NEW YORK. Hundreds of empty lots in New York City

are now available to neighborhood groups for recreation
use. An interested group may lease the lot for a nominal
fee from the Department of Real Estate. It must acquire
liability insurance and keep the area clean. However, the
group must agree not to make any capital improvements,
such as putting in swings and large equipment.

The city will clean the lot before leasing it if the group

36

   

desires. But the city retains the right to
break the lease with thirty day’s notice
and sell the land. (The city holds peri-
odic auctions for its lots.)

The idea was conceived by Peggyann
Murphy, planning consultant for the
Neighborhood Conservation Program,
and approved by J. Clarence Davies,
chairman of the Housing and Redevelop-
ment Board, and Ferdinand Roth, com-
missioner of Real Estate. Miss Murphy
points out that the city owns hundreds of
lots which “are ust lying fallow, collect-

  

,.   ..  ,  _ - ing rubbish and becoming rat havens and

hazardous play areas.” (The Department of Sanitation

cleans most of these lots three or four times a year for about
$50 a cleaning.) “We can change all these negative factors
into positive ones with a little help from the neighborhood,”
she said. Four lots were put into use last summer by the
Neighborhood Conservation Program. One lot was turned
into a play area after the city cleaned it. Three other lots,
in Brooklyn, were made into gardens. The city cleaned the
lots, and the top soil was donated by the Abraham 32 Straus
department store. The gardens were planted and cared for
by residents of the arca under the sponsorship of the Neigh-
borhood Conservation Program.

The Conservation Program also sponsored the conversion
of the lot in Manhattan, but Miss Murphy said the program
is really aiming for neighborhood Sponsorship. “We hope
the four lots already converted will be turned over to neigh-
borhood groups and that other groups from all over the city
come forth to take part in the plan.”

0 “Fitness through fun for every member of the family”
is the credo of the new recreation center at Edgerton Park
in Rochester. Apparatus and facilities to suit the needs of
every age group from toddler to senior citizen now fill an
area that only two years ago was wasted space. The centcr
provides a modern play area for youngsters, picnic area for
senior citizens, shuffleboard, outdoor patio for tcenage danc-
ing and roller skating, tennis courts, basketball courts, base-
ball and softball diamonds, a gymnasium, an auditorium.
and outdoor game court. The children’s play area offers
playground equipment designed to serve the needs of chil-
dren in our push-button age. For thc child who no longer
chops or carries wood, hauls or pumps water, shovels coal

0 In New Y ork City, Park Commissioner Newbold Morris
reported recently some facts and figures on what it takes to
keep Central Park in condition. He said that to correct the
ravages of time, weather, soot, gasoline fumes and “thc
intensive and often improper use of Central Park” depart-
ment workers do the following: Spend forty-five thousand
manhours a year rehabilitating the park and an equal num-
ber of manhours just maintaining the grass, flowers, shrubs,
and trees. They use five hundred cubic yards of top soil
every year, four hundred cubic yards of humus, one hun-
(lred cubic yards of well-rotted manure, three hundred bales
of peat moss, a hundred tons of ground limestone, sixty-five
tons of fertilizer, and five thousand pounds of grass seed.
The commissioner said fifty thousand sods of grass are used
annually to patch ballfields and lawns and cover bare spots.
The same number of English-ivy plants are planted every

year along with one hundred trees and seventy-five hundred
shrubs.

NORTH CAROLINA. In Burlington a new dam and new
facilities at Lake Burlington are providing the area not only
with an extra reservoir of drinking water (3,000,000,000
gallons) but also with a beautifully wooded and landscaped
park and marina where residents of the area can go pic-
nicking, boating, sailing, or water skiing without traveling
a great distance from their homes. Approximately 750 sur-
face acres are now covered in water backed up by a towering
concrete dam that only a few months ago turned rolling
woodlands into one of the largest bodies of water in this
section of the state.

Here is a center for water sport enthusiasts; here is an
attraction for family recreation that has long been needed.
0n weekends the marina becomes a beehive of activity as
motorists approach the checkpoint station, pay the fee and
then take to their boats for several hours of fun. In another
section, nearer the entrance, a sprawling parking lot ac-
commodates the large crowds of people who continue to
pour into the park and marina area. More than fifty diHer-
cnt cities have been registered to date on the checkpoint log.

JANUARY, 1962

Water skiers skim over the lake for almost its entire live-
mile length. Even the very young crowd into the skiing act,
and last summer almost all teenagers around were as anx-
ious to learn to ski as to pick up the latest dance steps. In
fact, water skiing came into its own as a recreation and now
ranks 'as the Number One water sport in this area. The lake
warden, Dan Viers, says that boats to pull skiers have been
in such demand that youngsters often stand in line and await
their turns.

Folks in Burlington look with pridc to this project that
for so many years was only a dream. It was not until Sept.
28, 1958 that a bond election opened the way for the facili-
ties to become more than sketches on paper or discussions
in council meetings. By April of that year the plans werc
completed and contracts awarded, with the actual work on
clearing thousands of acres and construction of the dam
getting underway in July. Dynamite, giant cranes, and
bulldozers moved into the Stoney Creek area and began the
task of removing tons of stubborn rock and acres of timber.
Only a few months later a giant spillway stretched 345 feet
across Stoney Creek, and 80,000,000 pounds of cement had
been poured to form the barrier that now backs up water
over hundreds of acres. By spring of last year the under-
growth had been cleared, pine seedlings set out, the banks
sown with grass, parking lots laid out and graveled, build-
ings erected and an access road cut through the wooded
area leading from the highway entrance. Cover crops were
planted on the shoreline to keep down soil erosion. A float-
ing safety line made of Styrofoam blocks was thrown up
across the lake just above the dam as a measure designed
to keep boats from penetrating the area too near the summit
of the dam. From the state nursery, the city of Burlington
purchased more than fifty-five thousand loblolly pine seed-
lings which were set out during the winter season.

PENNSYLVANIA. The underground movement in the
zoo field has reached Pittsburgh which is spending $400,000
to develop an underground zoo, expected to be ready next
May. It will augment the city’s existing Highland Park Zoo
and is an expansion of any idea pioneered several years ago
in Tucson, Arizona.

Pittsburgh plans to exhibit fifteen to twenty species of
creatures, ranging from a prairie dog to a kinkaou. It also
wanted to exhibit a duckbilled platypus but Australia re-
fuses to export any more of the animals. The zoo actually-
will be a 300-foot-long tunnel made of concrete, curving like
a cave. It is being built on an excavated hillside. When
construction is finished, bulldozers will cover it with earth.

The visitor will be able to see a beaver working under-
water building a dam, a wolverine in a burrow, a “hibernat-
ing” bear, prairie dogs, the blind fish, an aardvark, a kinka-

' jou, and bats. The light will be dim and the visitor, by lean-

ing on a rail in front of glassed or barred cages, will switch
on a light in the adjacent cage. The light is not expected to
annoy the creatures. In an adjoining concrete cave, there
will be a mushroom garden.

The zoo is being financed principally by the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Foundation of Pittsburgh and construction is being
done in collaboration with the city of Pittsburgh.

I A guide to a desirable minimum of
equipment needed by a park depart-
ment to operate effectively, economi-
cally, and efliciently has been prepared
by a project study committee of the
American Institute of Park Executives,
Manual of Park Equipment for Cities
of 150,000 or less. This handbook is a
management aid in its true sense. It is
intended to serve as a guide in submit-
ting purchase recommendations to park
boards and commissions. It will be use-
ful to two types of park departments:
0 Expanding departments which do not
know what sort of equipment might best
suit their growing needs.

0 Established departments that know
their needs but could benefit from out-
side support to justify planning and
purchase recommendations to city au-
thorities.

In his introduction to the manual,
Carl Fenner, chairman of the project
committec, states: “The committee saw
quickly that a simple listing of trucks,
mowers, saws, and spraycrs would not
make any significant contribution to the
park field. Local conditions governing
skill and availability of labor, park-use
habits. budgets, and plant growing con-
(litions vary so much that any listing of
equipment must be qualified and inter-
prcted hv the individual park man in
terms of his own needs. These questions
wcre considered whcrevcr possible in
the discussion following each listing of
equipment.

I. What kinds of work can better be
done by equipment than by hand?

2. What kinds of equipment are pres-
ently in use, but may not be widely
known?

a. New machines for spccial uses.

h. New uses for old machines.

3. How much can one machine (10?

4.. How many kinds of work (multi-
ple-use) can a machine do?

The manual is well organizcd, is com-
prehensive. and will he of practical
value to anyone who manages park 0p-
erations in cities of 150.000 or less.
Available for $2.00 ($1.00 for AIPE

A Course for Puppetry Teachers

petry Guild and the Ontario Pup-

petry Association are planning a
course that would lead to certification

T1113 SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO Pup-

of leaders and teachers of puppetry.
The projected course would include:
History of Puppetry: Europe, Asia,
United States, Canada.

Types of Puppets: (1) classification
and characteristics; (2) uses in recre-
ation, therapy, education, entertain-
inent, etcetera.

Teaching Methods and Philosophy: (1)
techniques with adults or children; (2)
development of a lesson—motivation,
preparation, application in practice;
(3) organization of class or group;
conduct of classes—authoritarian, dem-
ocratic, and laissez-faire.

Materials: (1) construction materials;
(2) tools; (3) sources of materials;

Digested with permission from the Com-
munity Courier, A pril-May-J une, 1961.

(4) how to plan for ordering; (5) ar-
rangement of workshop.

Play Writing: (1) original plays based
on given characters; based on suggested
plot outlines; (2) adaptations from
plays and stories; ( 3) elements of the
dramatic story: mood, suspense, climax,
denouement.

Staging the Production: (1) stage
construction; (2) scenery and set de-
sign; (3) music; (4) lighting; (5‘)
voice production; (6) direction; (7)
costumes (color, authenticity, harmony,
mood, suitable materials); (8) use of
technical equipment (sound effects,
tape-recorders, sound projection, rheo-
stats, etcetera) .

Practical Applications: Each student
will present two short plays, one with
hand puppets, the other with 1narion-
ettes. A list of suggested themes will
perhaps be set, but one of the plays is to
be original. The student will be respon-
sible for the puppets, the settings. and

the entire production, though the work
may be Citr'ietl out by a group under
his or her direction.

Assigned Remiings: (1) a group of
books on pertinent subjects will be cir-
culated among the students; (2) a gen-
eral list of readings on music, drama,
puppetry, teaching methods, and edu-
cational psychology will be provided;
(3) list of recommended titles and au-
thors: Children. and their Art, C. D.
Gaitskell; The Marionette and the Hand
Puppets, George Merten; The Puppet
Theatre Handbook, Marjorie Batchel-

Land
Ethics

“We must develop an ethical awareness
of the landscape . . . a sort of personal ma-
turity of man in nature and nature in man”

W. C. Yeomans
Q- MONG our great national heritage of freedoms has been

the freedom to enjoy the land, to cultivate it, explore

it, and utilize its resources for our diverse ends. This
is one of our most valued social legacies. Yet, at this very
moment, forces are at work to deprive us of both the land
and the right to its use. These forces are twofold: physical
or ecological and those generated by man.

Natural forces of reduction, such as wind and water ero-
sion or biotic community deterioration and regeneration,
are either generally beyond our ecological control or altered
for man’s beneficial use within flood control zones, reservoir
impoundments, and forest management areas, to mention a
few examples. Within natural areas, such as Oregon’s Three
Sisters Wilderness, we do not wish to alter them, since their
phenomena becomes a part of the experience we call outdoor
recreation.

Concurrently at work upon the earth, however, are the
erosive forces of man. In small numbers, he inflicts hut
minor inroads upon the recreation resource base, whether
it be a formal city park or a remote wilderness area. In
direct proportion to his numeri‘Cal increase and consequent
descent upon the recreation resource, the land suffers.

MR. YEOMANS is a landscape architect and park and recrea-
tion consultant in Bend, Oregon. This material is adapted
from a talk presented at the Cascade Recreation Workshop,
Camp Sherman, Oregon.

40

So recent has been our national population increase with
its corresponding extension of leisure- time, mobility, and
income, that the science of assessing maximum allowable
recreation capacities is hardly out of the formative stage.
Where such standards have been determined, satisfactory
means for their implementations have not yet been devised,
short of extending campground areas, screening plants from
impaction, and, in some instances, even surfacing with struc-
tural materials.

Meanwhile, more roads are being built to bring more peo-
ple to already overcrowded park and recreation areas. Mass
pack trips into wilderness areas, originally designed to ac-
quaint urban outdoor groups with wilderness values via the
saddle, invariably erode perishable trails, overgraze short-
lived mountain meadows, and leave their usual spoor of
debris.

I believe that only with restriction in use, coupled with the
development of a parallel ethical awareness of individual
responsibility toward the landscape, will we rest in the assur-
ance that our mountains will remain clean, our forests wild,
our lakes and streams pure and uncluttered. This brings us
strongly to the point of land ethics.

I have used the term “ethical awareness of the landscape.”
Aldo Leopold, in A Sand County Alnianac, stated “An ethic,
ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of action in the
struggle for existence, while an ethic, philosophically, is a
differentation of social from antisocial conduct.” I would
go a step further and add that, in either instance, ethics in-
volve moral judgment of a highly personal nature.

AS A MORAL CONCEPT, land ethics must apparently be

taught in a society not too distantly related to the rug-
gcd “nature taming” school of the last century. You will
generally find the European or Asiatic more aware of the
perishability of his natural environment—probably because
there is not much of it left to share. Until comparatively
recent times, we in the United States have had space to spare
-—or at least so has been the illusion. If the out-of-doors be-
came crowded in one locality, it was simply a matter of
“moving on.”

All of us are now patently aware that such an attitude was
ehimerieal. Wilderness, for example, has always had its
fixed geographical limitations. Recreation development can-
not possibly hope to sustain either qualitative or quantita-
tive pace with exploding population pressures. And at the
gates of our cities, as well as within them, the loss of simple
open “breathing” space has become cause for alarm at all
planning levels. Obviously we have no choice but to share
what is categorically limited in amount and quality: the
natural environment. We must be taught to see it: to feel,
hear, and otherwise sense our relationship to it before we
can be seriously expected to protect, preserve and cherish it.

IN CONCRETE TERMS, this may mean the time is not too dis-
tant when entry to wilderness areas will he by permit only,
just as our crowded metropolitan picnic facilities must now
be reserved early in the year. It may even come to pass that
some demonstration of personal interest or wilderness sur-

RECREATION

vival ability may likewise be an entry permit requirement.
1, for one, would gladly accept this limitation on my indi-
vidual freedom if I knew the qualities I sought in a wilder-
ness experience would thus be preserved. I would have the
further satisfaction of knowing those I might meet under
such circumstances and within such an environment would
likewise have demonstrated a willingness to wait for entry
into something irreplaceable—something perishable—some-
thing sheer numbers might in good faith destroy for all time.

These observations are not entirely subjective. They are
practical considerations, based upon professional park and
recreation planning experience coupled with personal ob-
servation. I don’t know where, at the public planning level,
enough policy courage could now be mustered to pose the
concept of restriction as opposed to unlimited mass use of
recreation areas. Political repercussions would be too se-
vere. Too many of us feel public lands are necessarily open
at all times to visitation whenever the mood comes upon us.
In any event, I am not at all certain this should be the source
of such a proposal. In a nation essentially urban in charac-
ter, and promising to become more so, the natural environ-
ment has become an avenue of desperate escape. National
forest and park administrators, as well as those at the state,
county and urban level, find it an overwhelming task simply

to attempt to maintain quality within the outdoor recreation
experience itself.

National consideration of the landscape as being highly
subject to loss or impairment through a series of individual
acts of vandalism, thoughtlessness or by sheer numerical
weight, will perhaps come, if not too late, through individual
awareness of reSponsibility to land—a sort of personal ma-
turity of man in nature and nature in man. It can probably

EPRECHEATION
y DIGEST

be sparked by those in a position to carry the message: edu-
cators, planners, foresters, park rangers—all communicants
at the public level. A strong interpretive program at the rec-
reation base itself which was oriented not only to plant or
animal identification, but the organic ecological whole of
nature as well—and man’s relation to it—deserves much
thought. We should discover more of seasonal meanings,
inspiration through meditation in natural surroundings—
more of a deeper understanding of the systole and diastole
of the living earth about us.

 

AND ETHICS cannot be forced—only encouraged. The
attitude, which becomes something of a faith in itself,
must be a discovery—an evolvement. We need our Emer-
sons, Thoreaus, Whitmans, and Carlyles as never before.
We need some sense of “belonging,” wherein the natural en-
vironment becomes an avenue of escape.

The development of individual, personal responsibility
for his actions—unpoliced and unsupervised—is one of
man’s more exciting and challenging manifestations of the
gentle art of being civilized. Short of such social evolution
toward mass conservation in the most general sense, we are
surely moving toward an environmental desecration ap-
proaching that of ancient Egypt. As Glickson recently
pointed out in Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth,
“The rate of deterioration of landscape is still much faster
than preservation. Comprehensive environmental recon-
struction is the only workable approach. Land-use planning
for recreation must be comprehensive in a geographical
sense . . . [for] the disfigurement of the landscape is not
merely a symptom, but also one of the basic physical causes
of cultural decline. The recreational crisis is part and parcel
of the general crisis of basic resources.” #

ments and facilities are to revert auto-
matically to the city without cost.

EARLY MOVES in the building pro-
gram were again examples of fine
cooperation between the foundation
and the city officials. The city improved
its access road to the park and helped
in the construction of the foundation
road from that point. Then, to get water
to the site, the city and the foundation
reached an agreement to split the cost
of laying a 3500-foot water line from
the existing terminus. Essentially, the
city provided the labor during the off-
season of the public works department,
and the foundation bought the ma-
terials. The line not only benefits the
Rocketdyne club, but—because it was
laid over the city‘s sporty nine-holf golf

course, generally through its center—
it offers the city the potential of trans-
forming the present sand greens to
grass greens.

After access roads were built, the
foundation leveled a flat, open area
adjacent to the airport and built two
baseball diamonds, back to back. Long-
range plans call for the eventual light-
ing of one of the diamonds, which have
helped to relieve crowding of similar
facilities in town.

Not long after, a skeet range was
developed at the far end of the property.
A fieldhouse providing restroom facili-
ties for ballfields and skeet range and
storage space for athletic gear was the
next item of construction to be com-
pleted. Most recent addition—and most
noteworthy to many—has been a 60'-
by-120’ clubhouse.

An imposing building, the clubhouse
is situated on a wooded hillside over-

looking the golf course, with patio
space at the rear. In the woods sur-
rounding it, the foundation intends to
develop picnic areas suitable for family
use in the mild months of the year. The
landscaping further enhances the area;
it is in keeping with the town’s interest
in beautification. Neosho, with a popu-
lation of 7200, is known nationally for
its efforts in this direction—it is labeled.
“The Flower Box City.”

Various Rocketdyne departments
used the club as the locale of depart-
ment parties and dances. A Neosho
social organization has booked it for
monthly use, and high school groups
have requested dates. The foundation
has made the quarters available for that
kind of use whenever company person-
nel do not have affairs scheduled there.
Thc city-foundation cooperation is be-

ginning to pay off . . . in both direc-

tions. #

the stamina that men and women
know when they face the wilderness
on their own. The frontier—wthe wil-

encouraged immigrants to become
good Americans and inspired Kath-

self beautiful for those pioneer “pil-
grim feet, whose stern impassioned
stress a thoroughfare for freedom

beat across the wilderness!”—Rep.

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

4‘ Watch for encouraging develop-
ments in recreation services for the ill,
aged, and handicapped in 1962. Every-
one in the field of therapeutic recreation
should carefully study the new legisla-
tion and the manner in which Abraham
Ribicoff, Secretary of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare, plans to carry out
these mandates. Two quotes from re-
cent speeches by Secretary Ribicoff are
noteworthy:

At the National Foundation Confer-
ence, held in New York, he said, “Re-
search is remarkable to be sure. But it
is worshipped out of all proportion. A
research discovery in the laboratory,
until it is applied, saves mice, not men.
Breakthroughs in research should not
be followed by breakdowns in delivery.
The key—uthe lifesaving job of the
health worker today—is to bring the
results of new research to people.”

At the Conference of the Family Serv-
ice Association of America, also held in
New York City, the Secretary said: “A
great new program of human renewal
is about to begin. It was no solution
simply to hand the dependent person a
relief check when he was beset by ill
health, faulty education, racial discrim-
ination, or inadequate skills. Again and
again we have seen what can be done
with creative, thoughtfully conceived,
and properly managed programs of pre-
vention and social rehabilitation.”

4‘ Chapters of the National Association
for Retarded Children are now actively
engaged in teaching a child—eventually
slated to return to the community—~50-
cial skills while he is still institution-
alized. This should do much to further
the development of the retardate’s vo-
cational potential.

‘4‘ Two leading youth organizations
will collaborate with Comeback, Inc. in
demonstrating how simple and inexpen-
sive it is to develop a recreation pro-
gram for handicapped children, using
lhe methods so well deve10ped in the
Homebound Recrcation Demonstration
Project—made possible through a grant
from the Office of Vocational Rehabili-
tation and carried out by the National
Recreation Association.

Dr. Morton Thompson and his exch-
lent staff at NRA are working with the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York
and the Bellevue Hospital Home Care

MRS. HILL is executive director of
Comeback, Inc.

Beatrice II. Hill

Department on a two-ycar project to
demonstrate how the social and psycho-
logical needs of the chronically ill home-
bound can be met. A group of ninety-
seven homebound persons were selected
and interviewed regarding their recrea-
tion interests by Dr. Thompson’s staff
which then recruited and trained volun-
teers to work with this group. With the.
help of the volunteers, 45 of the 97 cli-
cnts wcre brought to the NRA activities
center each week, where they were in-
volved in recreation activities to help
them become socially adjusted.

As a result of the stimulation derived
from attending these sessions, seven-
teen of the forty-five attendees are now
attending centers for nonhandicapped
people on their own initiative. Five are
also being trained vocationally.

This same plan of operation will
prove effective in attempting to gradu-
ally integrate handicapped children into
centers for the nonhandicapped. The
agencies concerned will bring children
into an activities center for the handi-
capped and, where possible, teach them
sufficient social interaction and skills to
make them acceptable for integration
into ongoing programs at centers for
nonhandicapped children.

Past experience in Connecticut, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania has proven
that the major problem in attempting to
put over demonstrations with children
is parental attitudes—usually based on
numerous fears for their children. How-
ever, this time, in both demonstrations,
the Child Study Association will show
how to work with parents of handi-
capped children to help them discard
their own fears, so that the child can
have social contact and be involved in
activities with so-called normal children.

+ The Report of the Therapeutic Rec- _
reation Curriculum Development Con-
ference is now available through Come-
back, lnc., 16 West 46th Street, New
York 16. This is an outgrowth of the
meeting held last February (made pos-
sible by the Avalon Foundation) to set
up suggested curriculum standards for
those colleges and universities offering
programs in the area of therapeutic
recreation. Almost one thousand copies
of the Report—which includes a sug-
gested curriculum guide—~have gone to
colleges and universities offering grad-
uate study in recreation, state and fed-
eral civil service commissions. schools
of hospital administration, and a select

Education and Open Space
Continued from Page 30

 

recreation interests. While recreation
agencies are fairly well united in the
general quest for open space and in fac-
ing some of the other overall objectives
in this problem and are pulling together
in meeting the pressures of alternative,
non-recreation-producing forms of
land-use, they are, at the same time, con-
testing each other in battles of marina
versus wild marshland or sanctuary-
park versus multiple recreation area. It
is, in fact, a race within a race that em-
bodies many complex relationships.

These and other characteristics of
outdoor recreation problems do not
spell simply opportunity for education.
1 think that education programs are ab-
soluter essential to the satisfactory
solution of these issues. They are the
key to real progress eliminating the
continual setbacks that characterize our
history of defensive campaigns. How-
ever, a particular kind of education ap-
proach is required, one specifically
aimed at helping communities solve
their outdoor recreation problems. It
should help pe0ple become aware of
their problems and aid them in work-
ing out the solutions for themselves.
Further, the type of educational effort
needed should be independent of any
specific government action program
that serves outdoor recreation. It would
not supplant the education efforts often
associated with action programs;
rather, it could greatly increase ef-
fectiveness.

Sponsorship of such education could
come from a variety of sources: adult
educational programs, institutions of
higher learning, civic groups. The task
at hand is so great that there is room
for many contributions, but one organ-
ization whose sole purpose is education,
and that has had marked success with
teaching approaches of this very na-
ture. is the Cooperative Extension Serv-

ice, an agency that functions with fed-
eral, state, and local financing in each
of the fifty states and in our territories
as well. I pr0pose that encouragement
be given our state extension services to
push ahead in this field; to provide
more of the basic education assistance
that would, in effect, prepare the way
for applying present and future govern-
ment service programs.

There would be strong advantage in
an enlarged effort by the extension serv-
ice: it is a long-established program,
well-organized from the grassroots to
Washington; it is close to research
sources bearing on local recreation is-
sues; among its specialists are persons
especially trained to work in the area
of community affairs. Extension has
gained its outstanding worldwide repu-
tation primarily in the field of produc-
tion agriculture, but it has natural re-
source specialists in each state, and in
recent years has been increasingly ac-
tive in forestry, soil, and water conser-
vation, and wildlife management. It
also has conducted successful pilot pro-
grams in natural resource ficlds that
could be applied to this need. Here ap-
pears to be an almost ideal foundation
for building education programs.

The preceding suggestion concerns a
relatively specialized and limited Oppor-
tunity in terms of the number of agen-
cies prepared to participate. A second
proposal for an educational effort could
be joined by practically every agency
active in outdoor recreation.

BEYOND THE VALUES of outdoor rcc-

reation that are commonly es-
poused—the therapeutic benefits to
body and mind—there are some others
considered less frequently that center
on reminding the outdoor recreationist
of his natural heritage and of his de-
pendency on nature. Some even look
beyond the gain of this increased aware-
ness and view the outdoor experience
as a potential for motivating man to ac-

tion on his conservation problems, or
even to move him closer to adOpting an
ethical approach toward his natural en-
vironment, an ultimate goal of the con-
servationist. These values deserve uni-
versal recognition by recreation agen-
cies and should be pursued vigorously.

The recent pace of science and tech-
nology has brought us only an apparent
independence from our natural environ-
ment.
these gains have tightened the lines of
dependency and even stretched some to
the breaking point. What is needed is
for man, especially urban man, to gain
a fresh and intense appreciation of his
place in nature, and it is outdoor rec-
reation’s unique opportunity to provide
it. Today, a very small and still shrink-
ing proportion of us gain our livelihood
from occupations that afford the chance
daily to witness examples of the drama

The fact of the matter is that i

of evolution or see the intricacies of na- '

ture’s life-supporting structure.
more and more of us are spending a
greater and greater number of hours of
our time away from work in situations
where such revelations are common-
place and available to all.

We must be challenged by the cogent
reality that, senses sharp or dull, people
by the tens of millions are making phys-
ical contact with nature. It seems in-
cumbent upon all who lead, or other-
wise participate professionally, in the
many ramifications of outdoor recrea-
tion, to make their quest one of stirring
and developing the perception of the
outdoor recreationist. Our efforts would
assume unique, far reaching impor-
tance; as Aldo LeOpold, a great leader
in our conservation movement ex-
pressed it: “To promote perception is
the only truly creative part of rccrea-
tional engineering.”

To date, our concern has been almost
entirely with the re-creative challenge
of outdoor recreation. Is it not time to
give attention to this creative opportu-
nity, as well? #

WE’LL NEVER BE twentieth-century walkers with Eden’s angels if we let malefactors of great stealth and

casual picnickers destroy [our] glorious resources. . .

. Every encouragement should be given to all

who diligently desire to extend the scope of nature. The naturalists and the conservationists are properly
concerned with valiant opposition to miscreants who want to take over a splendid forest for lumbering or
build dams where there’s no damn need for them. They should also support the city dweller who puts a pot
of amaryllis in his window and tries to save a peach tree on his twelfth-floor terraCC.—CHARLES Poona, Book

Dramatics for Creative Teaching,

Samuel Citran. United Synagogue

"Committee an Jewish Education, 3080
Broadway, New York 27. Pp. 405.
$7.50.

This book is of interest to those in
teacher education, elementary or sec-
ondary classrooms, recreation, camp-
ing, and religious education. It is a
result of the need to vitalize and drama-
tize religious teaching, but, although of
value to Sunday School teachers of all
faiths, its uses are not limited to reli-
gious purposes. Its title indicates the
broad scope the author intended.

It offers ideas for teaching language
arts, history, social studies, chor‘al read-
ing, literature, as well as for the dra-
matic activity per se in club, school,
private classes, camp, or recreation
group. The application of the tech-
niques of the mass media to the teach-
ing situation is made very clear so the
teacher inexperienced in radio and tele-
vision can use them successfully.

Mr. Citron is experienced in the
needs of teachers who do not have thea-
tre training and background, and his
book can be used by any teacher, be-
cause direction is clear and concise.
The author has anticipated possible
problems and prepares the teacher to
meet them. ~— fGrace M. Stanistreet,

Did you ever make a grasshopper or
a butterfly from paper and cloth
scraps? Every child loves to cut and
paste, and will be fascinated—~as will
adults—mwith the projects in this color-
ful and delightful book. It is designed
to bring out the creative instinct in chil-
dren by mixing commonplace objects
and materials with their native imagi-
nation. It trains them to see with new
eyes. Colored cloth, pipecleaners, soda
straws, flower petals, pieces of eggshell,
wrapping tape, bright papers, crayons,
paints—Hall can be used in making cut-
and-paste pictures or designs. The gay

Games for Boys and Girls, lillian
and Godfrey Frankel. Sterling Pub-
lishing Company, 419 Park Avenue
South, New York 16. Pp. 224, illus-
trated. $1.25.

This is a revised combination of two
previous books by the authors, 101 Best
Games F or Boys, and 101 Best Games
F or Girls. Except for the convenience
in reprinting, which probably accounts
for the inexpensive price of the book,
and except for a few singing games and
dual contests, there seems little justifica-
tion for keeping the division of the book
by sexes. “Redlight,” for example, is
not what is usually considered a girl’s
game, nor is “Three Deep” limited to
boys. The illustrations by John Fis-
chetti are clever; the type is readable;
the collection of games satisfactory, ex-
cept for the arbitrary division; and the
price is low. The paper cover, however,
makes the book perishable for long-
term use.

Craft and Contemporary Culture,

University Press, New York. Pp. 158.

$3.50.

The author is a potter who has trav-
eled in many countries and has used her
craft as her language in communicating
with fellow craftsmen in foreign lands.
She finds that “many of them have pre-
served the values that we have lost, ask-
ing that while we may be able to offer
to share with them our advances in sci-
ence and technology for the better liv-
ing of human peoples, they who still
hold it will preserve the wisdom of
craftsmanship for all of us.”

PUBLICATIONS

There is a chaptcr for everyone: the
potter, the teacher, the recreation
leader, the small workshOp, the de-
signer, and the craftsmen in industry.
There is also fascinating reading in her
descriptions of some special experi-
ences: the tea ceremony of Japan, a
walk in the parkland, and a Sicilian car-
retto. A creative-person will get a great
deal of enjoyment from this book. I
recommend it highly to leaders of rec-
reation for the sheer beauty of the writ-
ing and for the inspiration it. gives all
people to use their creative powers.-——

The Weaver's Book—Fundamentals
of Handweaving, Harriet Tidball. Mac-

millan Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New
York 11. Pp. 173, illustrated. $5.50.

Crammed with technical information
on handweaving, with good clear step-
by-step illustrations and patterns, this
textbook or reference book meets the
needs of the beginning handweaver and
also the advanced weaver who wants a
source book. There is much data on
yarns and methods of estimating quan-
tities; on equipment and techniques of
setting up a warp and of weaving; and
most of the book is on designing and
drafting weaves and patterns, with fully
detailed examples (diagrams and pho-
tos) , fairly classic in design and deriva-
tion. Solid tables of information, down
to the minute details of thread count,
supplement the lucid but professionally °
phrased text. One could learn to weave
just by studying and thoroughly un-
derstanding this book—but there is a
lot to digest.

The author, who has taught for years,
is editor of the monthly Shuttle Craft
Bulletin. She succeeded Mary Meigs
Atwater as director of the Shuttle Craft
Guild.

The Design and Creation of Jewelry,

Robert van Neumann. Chilton Cam-
pany, Philadelphia 39. Pp. 228. $7.50.

Here is a fascinating book, full of
fine black-and-white photographs. The
printing and the layout of the drawings

49

and photographs are in excellent taste.
It is the kind of a book that a craftsman
or student will cherish or long to own,
and would make a beautiful gift to one
who teaches or just does jewelry for
fun.

There isn’t a thing missing to help a
student, amateur or professional crafts-
man. The information is well written,
simple and complete. This author “feels
that skill alone is not enough; and he
directs the student to develop a design
personality — an awareness of design
possibilities — that continues to grow
along with the development Of skills.”

Supervisors in Action, Joseph J. Fam-
ularo. McGraw-Hill, 330 West 42nd
Street, New York 36. Pp. 238. $4.75}

The author makes a good case for
democratic leadership at the top man-
agement level. It seems quite clear that
no top-level position, be it superin-
tendent of a local recreation departmcnt
or the executive director of a national
or federal agency, gives the incumbent
a legal or moral right to dominate his
staff or to violate generally accepted
democratic principles or statesmanlike
behavior. An executive quality, com-
pounded of humility, self-control, and
inner strength, together with deeds to
match one’s words, is strongly indi-
cated.

Although many studies have been
initiated, the author recognizes that the
question of “what makes a successful
manager or supervisor” has still not
been answered adequately. In looking

50

at the supervisor, he gives considerable
attention to such areas as purpose,
policy, and program, working with and
through people, problem solving, or-
ganization structure, making what you
have set up work, compliance and cor-
rection, and accepting accountability.

The author recognizes the tremen-
dous cost and waste in turnover, point-
ing out that some thirty million job
changes occur annually at a cost of ten
billion dollars in business and industry.
We, in recreation, realize our own
serious problem at this point. Training
comes in for special emphasis—espe-
cially on-the-joh training—for it is
recognized that well-qualified workers
who are trained adequately are more
likely to be satisfied workers who do not
end up in the turnover statistics.

Here is a fresh new insight for im-
proving one’s skill in handling people,
and realistic solutions to the problems
faced on the job. The author’s treat-
ment of many personnel topics is lively
and interesting . . . a book worthy of
your attention I—W. C. Sutherland, Na-

which is a plea for closer cooperation
and coordination of all agencies and
groups interested in delinquency pre-
vention rather than its treatment or con-
trol. Four major objectives are dis-

When a sizeable number Of them turn
out badly, the question must be faced:
Why are we unsuccessful in transmit-
ting our way of life to our offspring?
What can be done about this? The idea
of a survey of delinquent youths and
their acts was conceived by two dedi-
cated persons, Karl Holton, probation
ofhcer of Los Angeles County, and Dr.
Elisabeth Frank, then director of the
research department of the Los Angeles
Welfare Planning Council. Their study
shows what can be learned for planning
prevention and treatment programs

and prison expert gives the reader a
conducted tour through the world of
juvenile delinquency—slums, court-
rooms, detention homes, even pent-
houses. Contending that we have given
judges in children’s courts too much
power, the author believes that we
ought to include in all such cases a
court composed of the common people
who know the neighborhood and the
home conditions of the child. The case
histories given are taken from her own
wide consultation experience. This is a
hrutally frank, revealing, and enlight-
ening book.

direction of deviant conduct. Our social
unrest is reflected in thc behavior of
our children: “Where there is great
social mobility and change, accom-
panied by population movements, re-
moval of large groups from traditional
cultural contacts, and important shifts
in the’functional and status roles Of
youth, [juvenile delinquency] hecomcs

read the chapter on environmental
group treatment which considers the
community life of the child during his
leisurc time.
