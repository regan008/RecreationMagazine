"0 Utterclimblnz No other play device can

IUNGLEGYM JUNGLEGYM for safety, for

low maintenance cost, and for
beneficial development of a child’s body
and mind. No other play device can com-
pare for popularity with children them-

unlimited opportunities for imaginative
play, and satisfies the child’s basic instinct

There are scores of other reasons why
thousands of JUNGLEGYMS ‘are in daily
use from coast to coast! For instance, the
JUNGLEGYM accommodates more chil-
dren per square foot of ground occupied than
any other play device, and costs less per
child accommodated than any other appa-
ratus. No wonder leaders in education, rec-
reation, health and social work have for a
third of a century called the JUNGLEGYM
"the perfeCt playground device."

RECREATIOi

Editorial

FIFTY YEARS A - GROWING

 

“You might as
well try to teach
fishes to swim as
1ildren to play.”—so said a legislator
1 1909. As a milepost of some fifty
ears of recreation progress, compare
1is statement with one made in 1953
y Mayor Clark of Philadelphia, “No
ected official could . . . eliminate recre-
:ion as a major function of local gov-
'nment and expect re-election.”

Susan Lee

Playgrounds under leadership—tad-
Dles being taught to swim, if you will
—are at the heart of the recreation pro-
ram in American communities today.
or the playground, or play idea, has
)read to parks and community centers,
:hools and housing developments—
nnetimes giving the backyard a new
use of life along the way. It has spread
eyond the teen-age, through the mid-
le years to the oldsters until, in the
:cent neighborhood plans for Chicago
e sec it coming full circle, combining
:hool, park and playground in a seven-
Dre unit.

In fifty years of growth, playgrounds
ave been in the vanguard and are still
[1 the march. Not only have standards
5 to space, design and equipment
loved forward but a greater profes-
Lonal competence in recreation leader-
nip has improved the quality of pro-
ram.

When one sees some of the newer and
lore imaginative playground designs,
uch as the Chicago plan, with its mul-
iple-use areas for sports and games,

dAY 1954

As our thoughts turn to planning for the coming
playground season, it is indeed appropriate that we
hear from Susan Lee, daughter of Joseph Lee——
father of the playground movement in this eountry.

its quiet corners for varied activity, and
its well-placed shrubbery marking off
picnic areas for family groups; or the
colorful modernistic equipment appear-
ing in the public housing devclopments
of New York and on various com-
munity playgrounds across the country,
it seems a far cry indeed from the mul-
tiple swings of yesteryear, so character-
istic of the dreary old-time city play-
ground with its concrete paving and
high iron fence.

This new design not only introduces
an element of beauty but re-emphasizes
the importance of a broad concept of
recreation; while the new equipment in-
dicates that there has been a fresh look
at children to see what they do when
left to their own devices in a free situa-
tion. To my mind, these are healthy
trends as it has sometimes seemed as
though, in our effort to socialize our
children in a highly competitive world,
the individual had become lost in the
shuffle and the family superseded by the
age group. On the other hand, the drive
of the youngster in search of drama and
derring-do, along with his comrades-in-
arms, has too often been limited by the
jungle gym or channeled onto the basc-

ball diamond .

Some of the better modern equipment
with its potential for dramatic play and
adventure might well serve as a spring-
board for introducing our modern cow-
boys to the time-honored hunting and
chasing games such as “Beckon” and

“Run Sheep Run,” “Duck on the Rock”

and “Prisoners’ Base”—activities where
there is other game to chase besides
gangsters and other forms of excitement
than “Stick ’em up!” Indeed, among
the “gunmen” in the backyard of the
city block in which I live, I have noticed
that ambush, as in the old game of

“Hide and Scek,” is the chief require-
ment.

.Some modern equipment provides
outlet, also, for the younger childis joy
in merely climbing up stairs or inclines,
and along ledges, jumping off low walls,
and crawling under and through things,
as well as providing him with houses
for his domestic activities.

In spite of the latent possibilities of
this modern equipment, however, play-
ground leaders should be on the alert
lest the designers’ interest in a new art-
form lead thcm to forget the basic na-
ture and needs of the child, or commer-
cial manufacturers either vulgarize the
equipment or limit its imaginative pos-
sibilities through a too realistic treat-
ment of structure. A tunnel, which can
be either a woodchuck hole or a rail-
road passage through the Rockies is
better than a permanent snake, or even
a subway. There is, in fact, a distinct
danger that the equipment will limit the
child’s imaginativc expression by being
too abstract or complicated or .too
stereotyped and static. Then, too, chil-
dren need boxes and assorted junk, as
well as permanent fixtures. They like
to mould their own world, actually as
well as figuratively, and should be given

261

an opportunity to do so. Playgrounds
should never become either too arty or
too slicked up. '

But no amount of equipment or play
material, however good, should be a
substitute for other kinds of recreation,
or take the place of leadership. Children
must not only have the opportunity for
contact with play material, but skilled
guidance along the way, if the exposure
is to take, and true growth as well as
joy come out of the experience. The
best equipmcnt in the world can remain
as dead as a doll without sawdust t0 the
child who has never had a chance to
learn its language—at best, its possibili-
ties will be limited; at worst, it will
never come alive.

Even in a free play situation, equip-
ment and'materials, of whatever kind,
should serve the child as a broad high-
way to new skills, new worlds to con-
quer within himself, and as a bridge
to the wide, rich heritage of the race in
games and dances, song, drama and
art. Though pictures of playgrounds
around the turn of the century may
look, to our modern eyes, old-fashioned

t

in layout and equipment, games they
did have—ball games, ring games, sing-
ing games.

From my own experience, in play
situations, both as a child and as a
teacher, I am convinced that what one
gets from the children (or what thc
children get from a play experience,
however free) is what the leader-—
whether in the home, in the school, or
on the playground—-—has within himself.
Perhaps this is especially true in the
arts, where, in terms of the child’s inner
growth, the leader is the veritable touch-
stone of success or failure. As Emerson
says, “It takes two to speak the truth.”

There is irony in the modern child’s
interest in spacemen (perhaps it ex-
presses the nostalgia of the race) as
space is something we have less and less
of, both indoors and out. And with the
disappearance of space—backyards
and attics, as well as woods and open
fields——many games and social activi-
ties of the past are disappearing. In. the
accelerated tempo of living, time, too,
tends to disappear, swallowed up by the
new locomotion and the new media for

passive and secondhand recreation.
Americans of today seem to be spending
more and more time doing less and less.
What price our hard-won leisure?

But children have not changed, not
basically, in their nature and their
need—to be somebody, to do something,
to belong somewhere; it is rather their
environment and their orientation that
have changed. The airplane, the motion
picture and the radio were born yestcr-
day, but .not the child. We deny the
child outlet for his needs at our peril.

In America 1954, the so-called pro-
gress of a scientific age has made play-
grounds more important, not less. Never
has a play leader had a wider oppor-
tunity or a greater responsibility than
now. Children, if they are to grow to
man’s estate, strong in mind and heart
as well as in body, need playgrounds;
for a child who grows up without play,
in all its manifold and creative aspects,
is as a ship without a rudder or a house
without foundations. Play leaders, like
runners in a relay race between the
generations, must carry the torch of a
dynamic heritage into the future.

SUMMER —VILLE, U. S. A.

The baseball diamond's clouded with the dust of boyhood Spikes
And here's a Flemish sand-box town, complete with mills and dikes.

Square dancers have their corner too; some lads are flying kites,
And all are learning to respeCt the Other fellow’s rights.
With jackstones, puppet shows, ring games, there’s always something new.
Play leaders hear the perfect phrase, "I want to be like you."

We’ll say it’s fun to be a youth and live the life of play,

No clock to punch, no boss to fear, no grocer's bills to pay,

No wars to fight, no shaving chores, no need to search for truth,
The playground is their Paradise—God Bless Them, Happy Youth!

Quickies from an Annual Report

Samples of the many interesting
straws-in-the-wind emerging from th:
annual report of the National Recrea
tion Association Field Department
which in turn is based upon reports 0
association district representatives:

0 There was a distinct improvement ii
operating budgets during the year f0]
the country as a whole. A “hold th:
line” condition prevailed in the Nev
England and Middle West districts ant
in New,York State, otherwise local bud
gets moved ahead in all other district:
during 1953. More cities received ap
preciable or substantial increases
Fewer cities suffered decreases and it
lesser amount than in the previous year

0 In the area of program for manner
and girls, there is more awareness oi
needs, with modest expansion to mee‘
them. Greater progress is essential, es
pecially in employment of more trained
leadership to serve this group. The em
ployment of a full-time woman assist
ant for the first time during 1953 was
reported by twenty-three cities.

0 As heretofore, athletic activities, par
ticularly major competitive sports, con
tinue to have heavy emphasis. In far
too many recreation departments they
constitute the main program with otheI
types of programs being entirely lack‘
ing or minimized.

0 Among cultural activities, every dial
trict reported increased interest ani
participation in arts and crafts by chi
dren and adults in this growing phaa
of local recreation programs. The lead.
ership training service provided by the
Association is credited definitely fOI
much of this advance. Interest in chil
dren’s drama programs shows some in!
crease although it is not general.

articles on the trends and developments
in the field of day camping.

Also worthy of the attention of the

would make an excellent companion to
this day camp issue of the magazine.

The Handicapped Child
Sirs:

In reply to a letter in your November,
1953, issue from Bill Hearn, on the
handicapped child on the playground,
here are a few of my ideas gained from
experience:

Should this category include the
often-seen child standing on the fringe
of the activity wanting to participate,
but afraid; who doesn’t know how?
The answer should be “yes.”

Perhaps this is a physically handi-
capped child. The child who has even
a slight handicap has an obstacle to
overcome in his play life.

For instance, the child with a slight
loss of hearing, but who is not wearing
a hearing aid, is unable to participate
in games where you have to hear or
face the possibility of loosing face if in-
correctly heard—such as in the game of
“Telephone” or “Gossip” or in a game
like “Numbers” where you have to hear
what is being said if you are going to
know when it’s your turn. Even during
a craft session, especially outdoors
where it is harder to bear with the wind
picking up the voice, the child who does
not hear the instructions and conse-
quently does not do what is eXpected of
him becomes flustered, turns away and
fails to return for fear of further unac-
ceptable behavior or reSponse.

The physically handicapped child,
such as one with a leg shorter or arm

MAY 1954

crippled, has a minor handicap which
does not interfere with a normal play
life, if the recreation leader is aware
of the handicap and adjusts leadership
and program accordingly. These chil-
dren can participate in many activities
-——for example, as junior leaders, in
club groups, as play officials, and so on.

They should be urged to develop a
real skill in something. Not a ,skill or
hobby to withdraw them from the group
but, rather, one to help them be real
members of the “gang.” It is through
a skill that these children can gain con—
fidence in themselves and a standing in
the group; with a tangible ability it is
easier to learn the give and take of play
and everyday life.

More food for thought along this
line: what about the “normal” child of
the group who becomes bed-ridden
with TB or rheumatic fever, or breaks a
bone, or in some way becomes confined
to home or bed? This presents a real
challenge for the group to continue serv-
ing him. Board games can be made and
sent, small group games played with
him, and so on. When he comes back to
the playground a quiet place can be
found for him in the activity to fit his
convalescence.

Regular activities can-be adapted to
the handicapped. Right now I am a vol-
unteer director for a social recreation
program for a totally deaf group. It’s a
challenge. Activities which “everyone”
is doing can be done by them with a
little thought and understanding and
adjustment.

Who Agrees?
Sirs:

I have a suggestion for your depart-
ment. I find in our own office, and in
the oflices of many other recreation
agencies I have visited, a dearth of
good, large recreation paintings, pic-
tures, and photographs suitable for
framing. Because of the nature of our
work and our large number of visitors
daily, much of the impression of our
offices consists of what these people see
during their visits.

Hospital Recreation
Sirs:

There were many things in Hedley G.
Dimock’s article, “Is Hospital Recrea-
tion on the Move,” in your February
issue, with which I agreed. There are
also several points with which I differ.

Hospital recreation is certainly on the
move—and one direction is away from
the first level which Mr. Dimock men-
tions, the purely diversional type of
program. Rather than two other clear-
cut levels, most good recreation pro-
grams in hospitals are a combination of
three levels.

Cooperation is undoubtedly a neces-
sary part of life, but I heartily disagree

that competition is not just as necessary
to stress when the hospital patient is at
a level to tolerate it. If he can not ac-
cept competition with all its concomi-
tant results, he is not facing reality or
ready to resume his responsibilities as
a well-adjusted citizen in a community.

Objectives in the second area are the
ones toward which most recreation lead-
ers work earnestly and are the reasons
why the sincere recreation worker will
never be satisfied with a purely diver-
sional type of program. This is not said
as a condemnation of diversional pro-
gram conducted by volunteers, because
parties and passive entertainment are
an accepted part of our way of life.

There is one place I would concede
there should be no competition. That
is among the hospital team. Mr. Dimock
has stressed the importance of the nurse.
The nurse is vitally important and nurs-
ing education is another area where
hospital recreation is on the move.
Many nurses’ training schools now pre-
sent lectures on recreation as well as re-
quiring each student nurse to work in
the recreation department for a specific
period of time.

I do not feel so complacent about our
leaders needing no training heyond the
usual requirements. The requirements
now are much too limited in vital areas.
As an example, little or no opportunity
is afforded them to try their wings
under adequate supervision before the
entire burden is thrust upon their
shoulders. ‘

Many volunteers have done a splen-
did joh, which has paved the way for
the full-time, paid, trained recreational
worker. I have read Beatrice Hill’s
pamphlet; and I am convinced it has
done much to raise the level of the vol-
unteer program and to be an inspiring
guide for new ones.

“A Challenge to Recreation”
Sirs:

The letter written by Mr. Mortimer
H. Morris, superintendent of recreation
at Croton-on-Hudson, New York, in
your March issue, seems 'undulyipessi-
mistic about recreation in the United
States.

In the first place, Mr. Morris appears
to be speaking for only a relatively
small fragment of recreation leaders—
namely the directors of organized ac-
tivity programs at the municipal level.

It should”he pointed out here that rec-
reation in this country is a hroad area
in human living. It includes those in-
dividual and group activities found in
homes, churches, schools, colleges,
youth serving agencies, private organi-

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

zations, local, state, and national gov-

ernmental departments, and numerous
other groups.

The concern over the quality of recre-
ation leadership would hardly apply to
the developments of rural recreation ac-
tivities such as, for example, those
under the auspices of agricultural ex-
tension agencies, 4-H clubs, and the like.
It would be questionable as to whether
the article speaks for local, state, and
national parks, to say nothing of the
great surge of interest in hunting, fish-
ing, camping, and travel. What about
many fine programs of choral and in-
strumental music or the arts?

To be sure, recreation needs more
and better trained leaders, as do many
other professions, trades, and move-
ments. It is recognized that organized
recreation is important, but let’s be sure
that one group doesn’t exclude the
others when speaking for recreation.

Reference was made to “missing the
boat” in school camping because class-
room teachers are handling it. School
camping is an integral part of the school
curriculum, and it is the responsibility
of the teachers to give it leadership.
City recreation directors having an in-
terest in camping could render much
assistance, however, as resource leaders.

It is true that there is an overempha-
sis on athletics, but the goodness of
other kinds of recreational activities
that are made increasingly availahle to
people will tend to restore balance.

The National Recreation Congress has
been an inspiration to many people, in-
cluding the writer. Like other conven-
tions, it does not appeal equally to
everyone, and it is not the only organi-
zation that suffers from inadequate con-
vention accommodations frequcntly.
There are many other professional or-
ganizations that have a major responsi-
bility in recreation and offer many lead-
ership opportunities to their members.
All such organizations have “ups and
downs” because human beings are in-
volved. The only real hope for im-
provement of total recreation is through
teamwork and cooperation at all levels
—local, state, and national. Recently,
there has been an attempt to establish
cooperative machinery for nearly a
dozen professional organizations that
have a common interest in recreation.
Many colleges and universities are now
in the process of trying to develop better
opportunities for the training of recrca-
tion leadership of all kinds, including
activity directors.

In the judgment of the writer, there
are many signs of progress.

Editorially Speaking

 

Spring

“For, lo! The winter is past, the rain is

earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our

land.”——-The Song of Solomon. ll. 11, 12.

Should Children Be Paid To Play?

Many people are not in agreement
with the policy Of discouraging the use
of prizes in favor of ribbons for the
many Special events on our playgrounds.
Perhaps an explanation is in order.

First Of all, we want our playgrounds
to be places where children learn. One
Of their important functions is to pro-
vide a safe place to play. . . . But we
have a greater responsibility to the
children and their parents than merely
keeping them safe. The playground,
its facilities and its staff, can greatly
augment what parents are doing at
home to help their children develOp into
fine men and women. We have a won-
derful opportunity on the playground
to help children learn to play crea-
tively together. The importance of this
part Of their education is second to
none. Children who learn, at an early
age, respect for other people . . . . are
more likely to grow up to be happy
and useful members Of the community
than children who are encouraged con-
stantly to try their hardest to “beat”
everyone else.

Surely no parents can disagree with
us so far, and yet reports of many little
incidents here and there have caused
us to become seriously alarmed about
this matter of prizes.

A few illustrations, or rather ques-
tions, may help us to answer. . . . A
ten year old girl came home from a
dress-up party at the playground crying
bitterly. She didn’t win a prize. . . .
At one playground there were only two
entries in a tricycle parade. When ques-
tioned, the parents answered “Why
should we go to all the trouble Of dec-
orating the children’s trikes when they
only get a ribbon for a prize?” . . .
On another playground, a young boy
was being encouraged by the super-
visor tO join a ball game. He asked
“What’s in it for me if I do? What
is the prize?”

Is it too much to expect children to
play for fun?

Certainly, the bigger and better the
prizes, and the more of them, the
greater the participation. But what of
all the tears and broken hearts after-
wards because “the judges were unfair.

MAY 1954

I should have the first prize.” What of

the youngsters so stimulated to win that
they will cheat to do so?

Is there not a danger that the con-
tinued and in fact increased use of pri-
zes is deveIOping a group of children
who are in danger of growing up with
a very false set of values? One super-
visor reports the following episode. A
small boy about to enter a race, asked
her “what do I win if I win?” She
told him he would win the race. His
reply was “NO, but I mean what do
I win?” When it was fully explained
that he would have the satisfaction Of
having won the race, he didn’t think
it worth even running so he didn’t enter
it.

Parents can help . . . by teaching
your children that it is fun to play a
game, to run a race, to dress up for
a parade. . . . by visiting your play-
ground and assisting the supervisors
with their plans, and if there is some
money burning a hole in the treasurer’s
pocket --— why not buy ice cream for
all of the kids?—MARGARET FARR, in

“Cantrfare”
D

United efforts succeeded in having
a truce declared in “gangfare” in South
Philadelphia, according to Centerviews,
bulletin of the Philadelphia Recrea-
tion Department. For several months,
United Neighbors and the department
of recreation had been working hand-
in-hand to solve the gang problem. The
group was successful in calling a meet-
ing at Seger Recreation Center, which
was attended by twenty representatives
Of the gangs. All the representatives
wanted the gang rivalry halted and in-
vited each of the various groups to
each others’ social functions.

At a second meeting held at the Stan-
field House, representatives from all the
gangs were present, totaling over 150
boys and young men. It was unani-
mously agreed that the “hatchet” be
buried. A grievance committee of five

From “Promotion, a Must,” a paper presented at the League of Calif-
ornia Cities Conference, in the “Success Symposium” on Recreation.

.. THE PLAYGROUND

As I sit here at my desk, a vision

appears before my eyes. I can see
a boy with tousled head and freckled
face ambling up a sidewalk in an un-
known city. He has time on his hands
and nothing to do. Let’s call him Bob.
Listlessly he moves along, kicking a
stone for want of something else to
think about. He comes to an intersec-
tion and turns right. Remember, he
turned right! Moving half-heartedly
along he soon comes to a playground on
which a ball game is being played. He
stands by the fence, looking on. Soon
one of the participants calls out, “Hey,
you wanna play?” Bob becomes inter-
ested; and soon he is engrossed in the
game. When he comes to bat he gets a
double, drives in a run and immediately
receives the plaudits of the group. He
has found a recreation Opportunity
which may mean much in the days,
months and even years that lie ahead.
The vision clears and I lean back in
my chair, smiling over the plot of my
little dream. But, I am brought up with
a start by the thought, “What if Bob
had turned left instead of right at that
intersection?” I close my eyes, expect-
antly; soon the vision comes again.
There is the same old Bob, still look-
ing “for something to do.” He comes to
the corner, shrugs his shoulders and
turns to the left. Up the street he passes
the corner malt shop. In front stand
three or four members of the local
“gang?”r One'of them steps forward,
challenges Bob’s right to the sidewalk

and, to back up his argument, clouts

Bob on the side of the head. Bob im-

mediately squares off with him and they
go ’round and ’round. The battle rages
for a couple of minutes and then the
opponents back off, each with new-
found respect for the other. Having
seen that Bob is capable of using his
fists, the gang accepts him as one of
their own. Bob now has found some
new friends. This haphazard meeting,
and the resultant joining of the gang,
might well mean the ultimate downfall
of this young lad. Little by little, devia-
tional and delinquent patterns may de-
velop until he becomes enmeshed in
habits too strong to overthrow.

As I ponder these two dreams, I am
staggered by their meaning. To think
that a casual choice, such as whether
to turn to the right or to the left, could
mean so much in the life of a boy. As I
think on, I am troubled with another
question. Why did Bob not know about
the playground before he left his home
that afternoon? Did someone in the
local recreation department fail to uti-
lize the various means of publicity to
get 'the word out to Bob? I guess that
is the answer.

The moral of this simple little story
is that the provision of recreation facili-
ties and activities is not suliicient unless
the program is also promoted and pub-
licized. Any product, no matter how
good it may be, must be continually
brought before those who are expected
to purchase it. To illustrate, the tobacco
manufacturers in America know that
there are tens of millions of habitual
users of tobacco in our country. Yet,
they will spend over $33,000,000 an-
nually to advertise their products.

As recreation administrators, ours is
a task of continual promotion. Al-

though this term has become sur-
rounded with unpleasant connotations,
let us lay these aside and utilize it in its
proper setting. “To promote” means to
advance, to further or to contribute to
growth. Therefore, promotion in rec-
reation is to initiate or accelerate the
recreation program. This is our task.

How can we best do this? There is
no broad, all-inclusive answer. Each
individual community will have its own
particular means of advertising, pub-
licizing and interpreting its program to
the citizenry. These means must be ex-
plored, developed and utilized contin.
uously. Our goal should be to be all-
inclusive in our program, serving both
sexes and all ages, disregarding racial
distinction, religious preference or eco-
nomic level. It is obvious then that, if
we are to contact and inform these
many and varied people, we must vary
our promotional outreach.

In this short space I cannot develop
the promotional prospects, I can only
briefly comment on a few of the more
important and useful ones.

The best and easiest medium by
which to reach the youth is, of course,
the school. This necessitates a rapport
with the schools sufficient to utilize their
agencies to make contact whenever
necessary. Such harmonious relation-
ship is now being used, to the mutual
advantage of both the school and the
recreation department, in many locali-
ties. For a simple announcement the
use of the school bulletin or the inter-
com system is often sufficient. Flyers,
questionnaires, and so on, can be dis-
tributed by the teachers in their reSpec-
tive rooms if they are properly placed
in their hands.

RECREATION

ewspaper coverage. Anything that
as happened or is about to do so is
1ews. If the story is typcd in newspaper
tyle it often is readily accepted, and
ppreciatcd, by the person covering
hat particular department, such as
ports, socicty, women’s page, and so
n. A regular column, such as a weekly
calendar of events, is often acceptable
to the newspapers, but will be printed
only if it is submitted on time. A pic-
ture in recreation, as well as in all else,
is often worth more than a thousand
words. The recreation dcpartment
should own a camera. If not, the local
police department has one which can,
lin most situations, be borrowed for the
+asking. This eliminates the expense of
using a professional camcraman. [See
“Simple Rules for Good Photographs,”

ECREATION, June 1953, or send for a
ree reprint.]

The local radio station also stands
eady to accept proposals from the en-
erprising recreation promoter. A reg-
ular weekly feature, on donated time,
can, at times, be had for the asking.
The sports announcer stands willing
and ready to give a boost to all local
sports activities if he is simply asked
to do so. The program director is con-
tinually looking for local tidbits to spice
up his regular program. Often he can
be persuaded to have some event in the
recreation calendar broadcasted, either
“live” or taped.

Public meetings, to discuss some as-'
pect of community life, are often one of

the best ways to contact public-spirited
citizens. Such meetings, when conduc-
ted properly, offer a fine medium to
promote the program. Out of such a
meeting, and the critical thinking
aroused, citizen participation can often
be secured and public support solicited.

All newcomers to the community
should be immediately informed as to
the availability of the recreation serv-
ices. If the city utilizes such a person
as a “city hostess” she can distribute
promotional material to all the new
citizens. If not, their addresses may be
secured from the public utility com-
panies and the literature can easily be
mailed to them.

For special events a sound truck will
get the word out in an expedient fash-
ion. Such cquipment can often be had
for the asking at some local business
house that uses this medium of adver-
tising. If not, the necessary loud-
speakers can be borrowed or rented
from many radio repair shops and be
attached to an automobile. This me-
dium is one that tells the information

rapidly to many, for little money.

These are but a few of the opportuni-
ties available. A yearly calendar of
prospective events should be printed.

 

Also, seasonal bulletins are in order.
Properly placed posters are ideal ad-
vertising and can be made at little ex-
pense. Exhibitions and window displays
of departmental activities are excellent.
Announcements made in the local mot-
ion picture theaters reach many young-
sters as well as adults. The time of
annual or oiiicial reports can be pub-
licized and used as promotional ma-
terial. Speeches can and should be
made to service clubs, PTA groups, and
so on, from time to time to contact this
element of the adult population.
PROMOTION IS A MUST. All else will
fail, to a greater or lesser degree, unless
we persistently, regularly and frequent-
ly tell the people from whom we get the
money what we are doing with it.

Services for Youth

Assistance in the operation of com-
munity leisure-time enterprises should
be recognized as a form of service eSpe-
cially appropriate for youth. Definite
efforts should be made . . . to mobilize
youth effort for the mutual benefit of
youth and the community, and young
people should share in the planning of
programs—From Youth and the Fu-
ture, published by the American Coun-
cil on Education.

S peeial Events

Fantastic Horse Sliow.———“Any horse that isn’t a horse” cre-
ated a sensation on our playground. The entries included an
oil painting of a horse, horses of plastic, plaster of Paris,
wood, metal, and clay; stick horses and even horses made
of paper sacks. Some of the horses were garlanded with
wreaths of marigolds, bells, and ribbons. The classifications
included the wildest looking, best home-made, funniest, pret-
tiest, largest, and smallest—CHRISTINE L. GANTLEY, Dorah

Soap Box Derby—This was one of our most successful
eveiits. We used a wooden sled- or ski-slide located on the

playground for the race. The slide was constructed of rough
lumber with two-by-four framework. The boards were
spaced two inches apart, horizontally, on the ramp surface.
For this reason we borrowed lumber and nailed it vertically,
down the slide, to make it serviceable.

At its highest point, the ramp was twenty feet and had a
railing around the t0p and the two sides. We built a wooden
lever arrangement-at its t0p to rclease the cars for their
descent.

A small area on one side of the ramp was used as a car
pit. The tiny mechanics brought their hammers, nails, and

oil to this roped-off section and serviced their vehicles like
professionals.

The runway, over one hundred twenty-five feet long, was

r0ped oil to keep back spectators. White lime was used t
mark oil twenty-five-foot distances.

Catagories included both light weight and heavy weigh
divisions for coasters and for soap box cars. All coasters an
cars with their drivers were weighed on a platform scal
Each contestant was given three trials and the best trial w
counted. We used a portable microphone to announce eac
boy’s trials, safety regulations, and so on.

First place in each division was won by the boy who
car rolled the greatest distance. At the time of our (ler
there happened to be a carnival in town and we were fort
nate to receive complimentary tickets. The first-place wi
ner in each division received a dime-store trophy and sc
eral carnival tickets. We awarded free tickets for secou
and third places also.

The boys used various materials to build their soap box
cars. Many used the wheels and axles from old buggies and
coasters. One boy whittled a broomstick for his axle. (He
happened to win a first place in his division.) A rope use
for steering was attached to the axle, near each front wheel
Rubber bands made from old inner tubes were used as sta
bilizers on the front wheels to make steering safer. Cars and
coasters with pneumatic tires were prohibited because they
would have given an unfair advantage to the few boys who
had them. Cardboard and orange crates were used for the
bodies and for trimming. The vehicles were painted with
enamel and water paints, and some boys even painted num-
bers on their cars. Football helmets and heavy jackets were
worn for body protection.

To publicize our derby, posters were made and put up in‘
various places in the neighborhood. The local newspaper
contained an article concerning the event. Then, too, boys'
from other playgrounds were invited to enter the race; and,
as an added attraction, the girls sold root beer and cookies.

Free Donkey Ri(les.-—-As a special playground feature,
donkeys are transported in carts to the various playgrounds
daily to give the children free rides. Hundreds of the young-
sters squeal with joy when the donkeys appear. The rides
have proved to be the most popular daily event on the play-
grounds.-—-Shreveport, Louisiana.

Out of Town Trips

. . \ . . . .
We’ve d1scovercd, 1n Champalgn, lllmors, that one of the

Diggest attractions we can offer is an occasional trip out of
:own. First in popularity is the annual trip to see a big-
eague baseball game in St. Louis or Chicago.

During the first two weeks of the playground season, our
Idult councils, junior councils and playground leaders meet
0 establish a “point system.” Points, awarded for sports-
nanship, participation, cooperation and other qualities, are
aarned for this trip. Leaders are responsible for keeping
'ccords on their children. We do not allow those under ten
0 make the trip.

 

Ioncrete ping-pong tables buzz with activity in Ricblaml,
Vasllington. No warping, storing or leveling problems here.

All money, except for meals and incidentals, is raised on
he playgrounds by children and parents working together
an all sorts of money-making projects such as carnivals, ice-
:rcam socials, watermelon feeds, movie concessions, and
ialnily nights.

Permit slips, to be signed by parents, are sent to them
.vith a note asking that the children be provided with ade-
luate, but not too much, spending money. Parents are also
Iotified that it is their responsibility to have the children at
he station on time and to meet them on their return.

We usually charter buses as it is easier to supervise the
:hildren in these than it is in public transportation. How-

:ver, this past year we used rail transportation. Arrange- ,

nents, taken care of by the railroad, included the train trip,
I sightseeing tour of Chicago before the game, a bus ride
lround Lake Michigan after the game, and box lunches on
he homeward trip. Each child brought a sack lunch to be
:aten at noon.

Individual playgrounds sponsor out-of—town trips to state
)arks and other points of interest. Usually these are onc-day
rips, but we have taken overnight camping trips as well as
:cveral weekend trips to Mark Twain Cave in Hannibal,
Vlissouri. The financing of these is up to the playground
~ponsoring them. In come cases, we pro-rate the cost with
Iach individual taking care of his own expenses. We never
lIlan expensive affairs.

Our community has enough civic minded organizations

which assist with the financing, when necessary, so that no
child is kept from taking a trip because of inability to pay.

Final Report

The following final report is required of all playground
supervisors by Pat Ruflin of the Wilson, North Carolina,
Recreation and Park Department, according to the North
Carolina Recreation Review. It is turned in on the last day,
and helps her considerably in planning for the next play-
ground season:

1. What do you consider the best part of your summer pro-
gram?

2. What do you consider the weakest part?

3. What changes would you like to see?

4. What was your most difficult problem and how (lid you
handle it?

5. What additional facilities and supplies are needed on
your playground for next year?

6. Did you need more leadership? Where, specifically?

7. How can the training program be strengthened?

8. Do you feel that this has been a satisfactory summer?

9. Would you like to supervise a playground next year?

Character Building

From Memphis, Tennessee, Marion Hale, recreation su-
perintendent, writes that the following—posted on all park
bulletin boards as a step toward character building on play-
grounds—received quite a bit of attention from the local
press:

CHILDREN’S BILL OF RESPONSIBILITIES
—To God, My Country, My Parents and Myself.

1. Grow in character and ability as 1 grow in size.

2. Be honest with myself and others in what 1 say and do.

3. Learn and practice my religion.

4.. Honor my parents, my elders and my teachers.

5. Develop high moral principles and the courage to live
by them.

6. Strive for health in body, mind and spirit.

7. Respect the rights of others.

8. Set a good example so that others may enjoy and profit
by my company.

9. Give honest effort to my work.
10. Regard my education as preparation for the future.
11. Obey our laws so that we may live happily together.
12. Preserve and strengthen our Amcrican’way of life and
government.

Singing City

THERE IS AN old popular tune saying,
“Did you ever see a dream walking?
Well, I did. . .” When I’m asked to put
the Singing City story into words, I
often have the feeling that I’m describ-
ing a dream that not only got up and
walked, but began to sing! It began to
sing (at least for me) in a most un-
likely place—on a ship in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean. I like to think that
the fact that I happened to be on that
particular ship was not really a coinci-
dence—but more like a small miracle.
It could have been any other ship that
was taking me home to the United
States, after a summer of volunteer
work in Belgium for the American
Friends Service Committee. But it just
happened to be the U.S.S. “Washington”
—and it just happened that on board
that same ship was a man named David
Richie, who was a full-time worker for
the Friends. David and I got to talking
about our summer’s experiences, and I
voiced to him some of my concern over
the fact that my musical experience, up
to that point, had been confined to only
one portion of the American commu-
nity. When I went on to say that I had
a crazy sort of a dream about some day
finding a choral group which would rep
resent all of the many racial, religious,
and nationality groups which go to
make up our country, David smiled and
said, “Your dream’s not so crazy. What
you’re talking about sounds to me like
Fellowship House Choir in Philadel-
phia.”

“Fellowship House Choir?” What in
the world was this? Was it really the
kind of choral group I had been pictur-
ing in my mind? David maintained that

it was, and suggested that I write to
Mrs. Elaine Brown, the director of the
choir. Actually, it was a good four
months later when I finally worked up
enough courage to write to Mrs. Brown;
I still couldn’t get used to the idea that
such a choir really existed, and I was
almost afraid that a letier would come
back saying that the choir had ceased to
exist. My fears turned out to be un-

founded. And the dream? Well, the ,.

night that I came up to Philadelphia for
the first time, and heard the music drift-
ing out of the windows of the building
towards which I was headed, I couldn’t

quite believe my cars. It was jazz—but
what jazz! The words made a pattern
as I got closer. . . “We’re in the same
boat, brother. Yes, it’s the same hoat,
brother. And if you shake one end,
you’re gonna rock the other. It’s the
same boat, brother!” Surely this must
be the place . . . yes, it was. There was
a sign marked “Fellowship House,”
swinging over the door of the building
from which the song was coming—and
the sign was rocking too, with the
music! I opened the door, climbed up
the long narrow stairs to the second
floor where the choir was rehearsing——
and stopped short.’ Because here was
my dream—and what a lively, vocal
dream it had become! The words of the
song filled the room——

“Oh, the Lord looked down from His holy
place,
Said, ‘Lordy me, what a sea of space.
What a spot to launch the human race!’

So He built Him a boat with a mixed-up
crew,

With eyes of black and brown and blue;

And that’s how come that you and I

Got just one world with just one sky!

We’re in the same boat, Brother!” *

 

* From “The Same Boat, Brother!” by Earl
Robinson and E. Y. Harburg.

 

And the faces of the singers shone an
laughed as the song came pouring 0
of their throats, for this was a song an
by white singers and colored singers,

singers who were Catholics and Je
and Protestants, and even non-believ
—by singers whose parents had co
from faraway lands to make Ameri
their home. This was the song of Ame
ica and of the world. This was the son!
of people who were happy together.
How did it happen—how did they g
that way? And who started it? I h
more questions than any one perso
could answer, but as I talked with tli
choir members and the director, aftd
the rehearsal, the answers hegan it
make a sort of picture in my mind——
and the picture was called (you’v:
guessed it) “Singing City”! Every pic
ture, however, needs a frame—and it
this case, the frame was fully as inipor
tant as the picture because, without it
the picture would never have come t<
life. The frame for the “Singing City’
picture was an idea, an idea which too]
root in the hearts of some young Phila
delphians about twenty-thrce years ago
The idea, actually, was more that
an idea—it was a strong belief tha

RECREATIOI

Philadelphia could be a friendly city, if
all Philadelphians put their hearts and
minds to the job. Out of this belief
:amc, some ten years later, a house——
the one of my story—-a house where all
kinds of Philadelphians could come to-
gcthcr and learn the ways of building a
friendlier, happier city to live in. And
there were so many ways of doing this
—ways for everyone, whether eight or
eighty! And one of the ways was, of
:ourse, through music. It turned out to
bc vocal music, because there was no
noney to embark upon an instrumental
orogram. But the one instrument each
person had, that he didn’t have to go
wt and buy, was his own voice! So the
Jeople with the voices began to get to-
gether, and Fellowship House Choir was
Jorn.

 

HAY 1954

Marjorie Penney, the director of the
Fellowship House at 1431 Brown Street
in Philadelphia, says that the first choir
had more enthusiasm than talent—they
looked wonderful—-but their first vocal
efforts were not always easy on the ears!
But they made, as she says, a kind of
harmony; and, somehow, this little
struggling .choral group hung together
——-no one knows exactly how, except
that they knew they belonged together.
Then, after several years of ups and
downs, along came a fine musician
named Mrs. Elaine Brown, who looked
at these very ordinary singers, of extra-
ordinary belief, and said to herself,
“Now this is the kind of a choir I’ve
been looking for—-a choir that believes
that people, all kinds of people, were
born to sing together!” Under her
warm and devoted leadership, recrea-
tion through music’ became more than
recreation; now it was’re-creationm-the
re-creation of love and respect for
human personality. The singers sang-—-—
and as they sang the liturgical music of
churches and synagogues, the folk mu-
sic of all peoples, and the strong music
of democracy, other choirs and choir
directors began to ask, “Can’t we share
in this, too?” And so a conductors’
group was formed—a group which
shared music materials and ideas, and
a group which finally put on the first
annual Singing City Concert at the
Academy of Music, in 1949. Since this
first formal inception of Singing City
as an organized program, each concert
has drawn into its orbit more and more
choruses and conductors.

I think of such choirs as the Lithuan-
ian choral. and folk dance group, who
performed So enthusiastically that they
nearly danced right off the academy
stage and into the laps of a thrilled audi-
ence. And the Catholic boys’ choir
which was jammed and crammed into
buses, coming all the way from Trenton,
New Jersey, to hold everyone spell-
bound with the crystalline beauty of
their singing of ancient Gregorian
chants.

And the innumerable other wonderful
choirs—-—synagogue and church choirs,
industrial choirs, recreation center
choirs (the Philadelphia Department of
Recreation is taking a lively interest in
the Singing City program, and is seri-
ously considering the adoption of their

techniques and materials in its many
fine centers), school choirs, university
choirs—-—almost every conceivable type
of choir is represented in the Singing
City picture.

You Can Obtain Guidance‘

Since that first Singing City concert,
other schools of music have joined with
Fellowship House in co-sponsoring the
Singing City program, believing that
people sing better when they have a
big idea worth singing about. One of
these schools is Settlement Music
School, a Community Chest agency,
which offers special training courses for
both amateur and professional musi-
cians, and fosters an extension program
giving all kinds of Americans the chance
to grow together, through the arts. An-
other sponsoring school is Temple Uni-
versity, which offers a new curriculum
leading to what is probably one of the
few baccalaureate degrees in choral
conducting in this country.

If you are a community or a rec-
reation leader, you can obtain guidance
in planning a music program for your
community or center; leadership assist-
ance to get your group started in its mu-
sical activities; opportunities to share
in combined concerts, festivals, and
workshops; and invaluable resources
for easing inter-group tensions through
music. If you’re a choral conductor or
a music teacher, you’ll find a variety of
training courses offered through'Sing-
ing City—-—courses such as conducting,
choral techniques, choral literature.
choral arranging; seminars on such
topics as “Music As a Community Build-
er”; “Music in Worship”; “Music of
Democracy”; and unlimited opportuni-
ties for the exchange of ideas and ma-
terials. If you’re a student, you can get,
through Singing City, the training and
guidance necessary for an important
career in community leadership as a
choral conductor. If you’re a member
of any kind of a chorus, you will find in
the Singing City program the chance
to share your particular experience or
cultural heritagc, and enrich the lives
of others, as you enrich your own. If
you’re a church or synagogue musician,
you can share in a stimulating program
of study and exchange in the field of
music of the faiths. And if you’re a
composer, arranger, or writer, you’ll

terested in new works in every medium

lief that every human being is of infi-
nite worth and of infinite dignity, and il
is this deep-rooted belief which shines
in the faces of Singing City choirs.

A choir went on tour this past sum-
mer to Europe, under the leadership of
Mrs. Brown, director of Singing City
When the choir had returned to this
country, Mrs. Brown received a lettel
from a professor of Heidelberg Univer
sity in Manheim, Germany: “Yom
notes have meant more to us than al
those from the ambassadors!” Man
heim was reduced to rubble by Ameri
can bombs eight years ago—and man]
of the pe0ple still live amid the rubble
simply because there is no other plac:
to live. To the pe0ple of Manheirn
America seemed to be a country whic]
talked a great deal about “democracy,’
but often didn’t practice it. Then, on
hot July night, the pe0ple of Manhein
crowded into the town auditorium am
not only heard a choir which was un
surpassed musically, but saw a 0110i
reflective of every single racial and re
ligious group in America. They wil
nessed the dream which is America—
and they wept, because this was wha
they had longed to believe, but wha
neither bombs nor ambassadors ha:
taught them.

What greater miracle is there, afte
all, than this—that the intangibl
threads of song should have the powe
of re-creating the long-forgotten bond
of brotherhood—of bringing men bac
to a glad recognition of each other a
members of one family—the huma

RECREATIO

September 27-October 1

T. E. Rivers I.

 

 45.

Among familiar St. Louis sights is the Levee down by the Mississippi.

With the help of the 1954- National Advisory Committee,
1e planning of another well-balanced program is just about
ompleted for the 36th National Recreation Congress in St.
.ouis. The annual Preliminary Pamphlet, as it has come to
e known, will be in the mail this month for all to see the
)pics selected for discussion this year and the general out-
me of activities for that busy last week in September.

Balance of content is very important in every Congress
rogram. Each is planned as carefully as possible so that all
rho are interested in recreation will find help: professional
I'orkers, board members and volunteers, executives and staff
tembers, big-city and small-town delegates, old-timers and
ewcomers, whether from public or private agencies. In an
ge of specialization there is recognition of special interests
f many delegates. The attempt is always made to develop
program which will encourage as many as possible to come
) the Congress and to help all who do.

Committees

In addition to the advisory committee mentioned above
nd the other committees listed in RECREATION in April,
no committees are hard at work on the programs for the
pecial sessions for executives and for supervisors. Those
rho have agreed to serve on the 1954- Executive Advisory
Iommittee as this issue goes to press are: James Grooms,
Vellesley, Massachusetts; Roscoe M. Marker, Whitinsville,
lassachusetts; Peter J. Mayers, New Rochelle, New York;
Itobert D. Sisco, Livingston, New Jersey; Russell Johnson,
'Iinneapolis, Minnesota; Jerome T. Femal, Bloomington,
ndiana; Ray Forsberg, Waterloo, Iowa; Kenneth M. Kurtz,
iasper, Wyoming; Frank Harnett, Long Beach, California;
Ioward B. Holman, Fresno, California; R. E. Anderson,

"Plus" Values in Conference Attendance

“A person who goes to a conference has to travel in two
senses, not iust one. We're all aware of the geographical
travef required . . . less apparent but more Important from the
standpoint of what the participants get out of the experience is
the sacfaf travef involved. Every conference is a miniature

saciety set up to assimilate, for the time, immigrants from
various backhome cultUres. Its aim is to produce changes in
these immigrants through conference associations—changes
which will modify, directly or indirectly, backhame practices and
patterns."——Kenneth D. Benne and Charlotte K. Demarest in

Congress Hotels

It is expected that practically all scssions of the Congress
can be held at the headquarters hotel, the Hotel Jeffcrson,
just as this was possible in Philadelphia last year. Those
delegates who prefer to stay at the headquarters hotel should
send for reservations now. Other cooperating hotels are the
Statler, the DeSoto and the Mark Twain.’ Rates in these
hotels are as follows:

Plan Preparation

The third stage of the operation is
the working out of the over-all plan of
recreation areas for the future. In effect,
this is a process of applying the stand-
ards to the map of the city—not the city
as it is today, but as it will be in the
future, with residential areas expanded
shrunken in
others, and with population densities
and composition probably markedly
changed.

Up to this point in the process, one
might ask why city planners are in-
volved; has it not all been a job for
recreation specialists? The answer is

in some locations and

that-in most cities the recreation person-
nel are primarily oriented to operating
recreation facilities rather than to de-
signing them. They have much knowl-
edge and much understanding to bring
to the processes of standard-setting and
survey. The contribution of the city
planning specialists is principally in
techniques of map presentation and sur-
vey analysis so necessary to make the
standards and survey material “talk,”
and also in providing much of the non-
recreational data essential to the survey

fessor of City Planning, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

and evaluation: population material,
data on land use, and the like. A team
operation, using both kinds of skills, is
far more effective and more valid than
an attempt by either kind of specialist
to do these jobs alone.

Once the system-planning stage is
cntered, the contribution of the city
planners is more clearly essential. Rec-
reation areas, once purchased and de-
veloped, are fairly permanent; there is
substantial waste incurred in abandon-
ing them and replacing them elsewhere.
50 it is important that the plan for a
new system of recreation areas be long-
range—an integral part of the compre-
hensive plan for the future growth and
deve10pment of all aspects of the physi-
cal community. It must fit future land-
use patterns and population distribution
patterns, which are almost sure to
change, which can to a fair extent be
predicted, and which indeed are often
deliberately planned to be changed. It
must fit with locations of major streets
and express highways; some of these
may exist, but others are yet to be built.
f In some cases, a recreation area may
be so important and so tied to a specific
location that it will be the plan of future
streets that must be changed to fit the
needs of the recreation system.) There
are other features of the over-all city
plan with which recreation facilities
must also be coordinated; probably the
most important of all is the school sys-

tem. The significance of closely related
systems of schools and of play areas is
clearly great, not only from the point
of view of physical layout and economy
of development, but also from the point
of view of economy of maintenance and
operation, and quality of both educa-
tional and rccreational programs.

The process of preparing a plan, of
determining the type, size, number, and
location of recreation areas for the fu—
ture, is from the purely technical view-
point most efiiciently performed by
locking up the team of technicians in a
back room until the plan is finished.
But this is a short-sighted efficiency.
which may well doom the finished plat
to a moldy death on the shelves of thal
same back room. This is going to bf
a plan of the community and for tht
community. The extent to which it wil
be followed by the community depends
in large part on the extent to which the
community can feel a sense of partici
pation, almost of ownership. The tech
nicians will do well to share with the
public, thc various citizen groups, ever}
stcp of the Operation that they can.

The Program for Action

It is almost certain that the plan, as a
ong-range view of necessary and desir-
Ible recreation system improvements,
[ill be beyond the immediate capacity

FAY 1954

of the municipality to build and put into
operation. Measured against capacity
and willingness to foot the bill, it will
probably be a task that will take twenty,
thirty, or even forty years. It is there-
fore an essential final stage of the plan-
ning opcration to deve10p a step-by-step
program for the fulfillment of the plan.
This is important because, with so much
of the plan deferred for so long, only
the most urgent things should he done
first. It is also important because a
thirty-year look is too long for most
people—“If it’s going to take that long
we’ll never get there.” The only way a
community can be started on so long-
range a project is to be helped to see its
way. The program, then, hecomes the
bridge across which the community can
he led to start toward the distant goal.
This action program is usually gearcd
to the community’s capital improve-
ment program, which is normally a five-
or six-year program for all capital ex-
penditures and public works. The an-
nual preparation of this program is the
joh of the planning agency, which rec-
ommends it to the mayor and council
who share the authority for putting it
into effect. It consists of a schedule for
prOposed land purchases and project
construction, which sets all of the com-
munity’s needs for permanent improve—
ments into a pattern of relative urgency
whose timing is tied to the fiscal rc-
sources that can be foreseen. Here rec-
reation projects must take their place
alongside projects for highways, sewers,
airports, schools, and a host of other
public works. But within this compre-

 

hensive pattern, the recreation projects
themselves must follow a pattern of
logical sequence.

Here there is a need for establishing
criteria of priority: another set of
standards, they might be called, to guide
the choice of specific items from the
long-range plan. Such criteria will ohvi-
ously be aimed first at plugging the big-
gest gaps in the present system of facili-

ties. Thus they are in the first instance
derived from the survey-evaluation ma-
terial, and its measures of inadequacy.
There is obviously a variety of ways in
which inadequacies can be compared:
one of the easiest to calculate is the num-
ber of people unserved. For instance,
all the people may he considered to he
unserved, in reSpect to a given type of
recreation area, who live beyond the
standard access-distance from any ex-
isting area of that type. Also, if accord-
ing to the area-population-ratio stand-
ards, an existing area is only half big
enough to serve the pe0ple within its
service distance, then half of those peo-
ple can be considered to be unserved.
If figures like this are worked out for
each part of the community, and thcn
expressed in terms of the varying per-
centages of the p0pulation of each part
that are unserved, there results an ef-
fective comparison of the relative in-
adequacy of the different parts of the
recreation system.

This kind of calculation offers a
rough measure of the relative urgency
of action to remedy the inadequacies.
It is, however, probably too rough to be
used alone. Other differences between
neighborhoods may have to be consid-
ered. An analysis of residential density
offers another aspect of urgency; pre-
sumably, families living in elevator
apartments without yards have more
immediate need of public play space
than families in single-family houses
with sizeable yards (assuming, that is,
that population composition is approxi-
mately- the same). A third criterion
might be the comparative rates of uve-
nilc delinquency in one neighborhood
or another, on the theory that provision
of an adequate recreation program
where none exists will tend to reduce
delinquency. This kind of sociological
approach can be carried as far as your
data and your conscience will permit;
it might even be argued that high-in-
come families without local recreation
service can drive to the country, or nor-
mally leave town for a long summer
vacation, and therefore, their need is
less immediate than that of low-income
families who have to stay put.

These examples should be sufficient
to show that in any community a series
of locally valid criteria can be set up, to
show, among the various parts of the

277

community and the various types of rec-
reation areas, just which Specific pro-
jects in which locations are the most
urgent.

This objective approach, however, is
not sufficient to serve as a valid guide to
an eXpenditure schedule. Another im-
portant factor is availability. This ap-
plies especially to proposed sites for
recreation projects that are now vacant.
In a community that is growing at the
edges, as most of them are, the compre-
hensive plan is likely to look forward to
still further new fringe development;
the recreation plan will therefore be
pr0posing a system of recreation areas
in these outskirts, taking advantage of
empty lands not yet built up. Here, the
urgency feature based on social need is
likely to be very low, or even non-ex-
istent. But there is another kind of ur-
gency: the danger that, if these sites are
not snapped up promptly, they will be
built upon. If that happens, the chance
to get play space in the right place will
be lost, or even perhaps the chance to
get any play space at all, except at pro-
hibitive costs involving buying and de-
molishing new houses. Since these
rapidly growing areas are now having
stamped Upon them a pattern of de-
velopment that will constitute the neigh-
borhood environment of many families
for half a century or more, it becomes
vital to the future of the community to
make sure that the pattern is a sound
one. We cannot afford to be faced again,
in these new sections, with the task we
already face in old areas of correcting
past mistakes and carving out breathing
space at great expense.

This suggests a second parallel sys-
tem of criteria, relating to the availa-
bility of project sites and the relative
danger that they will be .built up and
lost. For instance, if a growing neigh-
borhood has three possible playground
sites of almost equal quality, it is not so
serious if one of them is built upon; but
if the neighborhood has only one site
vacant that meets the standards, prompt
acquisition of that land becomes abso-
lutely essential.

The probable result of applying these
two systems of criteria will be a double
set of priorities, and in effect a double
schedule of projects selected for early
action. Those in the older, inner areas,
chosen on the basis of need for recrea-

278

tion service now, will be projects for the
immediate development of facilities,
perhaps even on inadequate sites to be
gradually expanded. Those in the newer,
outer areas, chosen on the basis of per-
ishable availability, will be projects
merely of land acquisition, with site de-
velopment and recreation-program ope-
ration deferred until the need for serv-
ice becomes compelling.

The balance in the proposed action
schedule between these two series of
projects will depend in part on their
relative cost and the amount of money
allocated to recreation, and in part also
upon certain political realities. To win
sustained community support for the
program, it must propose a balance of
progress among the different areas of
the community. If even the best-served
neighborhoods are not adequately serv-
ed, they or their representatives will not
vote year after year to spend all the
money on raising the standards of other
neighborhoods with no prospect of im-
provement for themselves. Completely
“scientific” objectivity in setting up an
action program may result in no action
at all. In order to win widespread pub-
lic approval and political concurrence,
the priority schedule must be so de-
vised that it will bring all parts of the
community up towards “standard” at
about the same rate, so that the whole
community will reach the goal at about
the same time.

Thus an impartially but realistically
devised priority schedule can serve es-
sential educational and political pur-
poses. If c0mpleting the whole plan will
take thirty years, a six-year program will
carry into reality a fifth of what needs
to be done. Six years is a short enough
time to be grasped by the voter and the
member of the city council; and one-
fifth is a big enough fraction to seem
like worthwhile progress. Six years is
also long enough so that projects from
most parts of the community can be in-
cluded, without slighting the areas in
most urgent need. Here again is the
process of political and public education
worked into the mechanics of develop-
ing the plan.

And here again, in this stage of pro-
gramming for action, the participation
of public and political interest should
be sought. It is not enough to have
sound criteria and apply them wisely;

\

before the program is crystallized, and
at a stage when it can still be modified,
the civic groups and the officials should
have their chances to influence it. This
is also the best chance for the technical
team to influence them. If the council-
man from Ward Three can be told, in-
formally and in advance: “No, we don’t
have that playground in your ward in
the program for this next year, but we
do have it for four years from now. The
reason for the delay is that the need is
even more urgent in Wards Seven and

 

Nine, as you can clearly see from this
table of priority factors. You can take
this story back to your constituents
and explain it to theml”——there is a
good chance, even with a politically-
minded city council, of getting agree-
ments to a program couched in terms
they can understand, and reaching far
enough into the future to benefit the
whole community.

Tools for Plan-Fulfillment

The final disposition of the recreation
area plan and the action program is out
of the hands of the technical team and
the advisory and operating agencies
that have nurtured them into being. But
the stage of plan-fulfillment is not be-
yond their interest. They may, indeed,
be able to advise the community not
only what to do and when to do it, but
some of the ways to do it. The plan
and program call for the acquisition of
certain sites, and their development into
recreation areas. The tools for accom-
plishing this may involve some new
devices.

The first step is the acquiring of land,
and there are several ways of doing this
without buying it. Some special sites
may be given to the community; this of
course is how many of our older parks
were acquired. In undevel0ped areas
where raw land is in the process of be-
ing converted into house-lots by sub-
division, the community may require
the subdivider to dedicate the sites for
play areas and schools needed to serve

RECREATION

1is lots, as well as for the streets to be
)uilt. In other districts, long-dead va-
:ant subdivisions may become forfeited
or tax delinquency, and the land that
hus becomes publicly owned may, if it
3 suitable, be developed for recreation,
rr if it is not suitable may be traded for
ites that are. In blighted areas, urban
edeve10pment projects for residential
Ise or public housing projects may be
equired to reserve some part of the
leared sites for recreation purposes.
ll] of these are ways in which progres-
ive communities are building up their
nventories of sites for recreation. Alert
rlanning and recreation agencies will do
tell to eXplore the local opportunities
or these bargain-basement processes,
nd to pass along to the officials these
Irocedures for plan fulfillment along
rith the submission of the recreation
Ilan and priority schedule.

Weighed against the total job to be
one, however, these devices are only a
artial measure. The most important
301 for plan fulfillment will be money.
lost of the necessary land acquisition,
nd all of the site development—the
aving of hard-surface areas, the in-
tallation of equipment, the planting of
tees and grass—these will have to be
aid for out of public tax funds. Since
rlese are all permanent or “capital” im-
rovements, the normal source for these
ands is long-term borrowing, financed

by bond issues.

Bond issues are political issues. In
many states and cities, they require a
favorable popular vote; elsewhere, they
require approvalafrom the city council
or other legislative body. If the com-
munity faces a long-term program be-
cause it is so far behind the standards
that it will take decades to catch up
(which is true of ninety-nine cities out
of a hundred), this process of bond-
issue borrowings for recreation im-
provements cannot be done once and
for all; it will have to be repeated every
few years for a long time to come.

This is the point, or rather the series
of points, at which an effective program
of citizen participation in the planning
process will “pay off” in a very literal
sense. If the procedures outlined here
have been tactfully and sincerely prac-
ticed, the voters and politicians of the
community will have had a genuine
share in the setting of standards and thc
determination of policy, in the evalua-
tion of the existing recreation system,
in the formulation of the long-term plan,
and in the setting up of the action pro-
gram to be financed with these funds.
They will have learned what proposed
improvements will mean to them and
their families and constituents. Most
important, they will feel that this is
their plan and program. How can they
not vote for it?

The success of the first major politi-
cal test of the recrcation plan will be a
measure of how well it has been con-
ceived and developed. It is a laborious
operation, not to be carricd through in
a few months or a year. It is not over
when the first bond issue has becn
passed. There will be other political
tests, some city-wide, some local. There
will be need for continuing education,
repeated efforts to sustain the level of
citizen concern necessary for long-range
accomplishment. There will be need,‘
too, for continued technical work, con-
stant minor adjustments in the plan,
and occasional complete revision in-
volving the whole process over again.
Nothing is more sure than the fact that
the next decade will bring changes that
cannot be foreseen, which will affcct
p0pulation composition, rates of city
growth, and the standards themselves.
In fact, an improved recreation pro-
gram operating within improved recre-
ation facilities is likely to increase the
community’s appetite for these things,
and require a successivelifting of sights.

This process of recreation-systcm
planning, then, like the process of com-
prehensive city planning to which it is
so closely tied, is one that can never be
considered finished. Like all the impor-
tant aspects of our living democratic
society, there will always be new fron-
tiers.

7” ILL TIIE RECREATION district conduct a summer recre-

ation program for our children this year? This
question was coming from parents of cerebral palsied and
mentally retarded children. With misgivings our district
decided tO conduct a playground program on an experi-
mental basis in COOperation with the Cerebral Palsy Asso-
ciation of Alameda County and the Association for Be-
tarded Children Of Southern Alameda County. Other groups
who assisted were Hayward Elementary School District and
Castro Valley Elementary School District of the Alameda

County Schools and, of course, the parents. Fear of having
inadequately trained personnel and insufhcient facilities
made us hesitant tO enter this new field.

Planning meetings were held with groups requesting the
recreation programs and, after approval by our advisory
board, we set up the organization for operation. We pro-
vided leadership for both programs, made arrangements for
sites and equipment, and planned activities. The purpose
was to provide a regular playground program wherein these
children would participate in activities being provided on
the other playgrounds in the district which, in turn, would
help them to become socialized and to play in and with other
groups.

The final report for each group was divided logically into
three sections covering pre-planning, operation Of program,

PROGRAMS

RECREATION PROGRAM FOR CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN

Planning—Meetings with superintendent, supervisor, occu-
pational therapist Of Sunrise School (site of the program),
instructor in charge at the school, and representative of
parents’ association were held. A meeting with United
Cerebral Palsy Association representatives, director of Spe-
cial schools and classes Of Alameda County schools, and other
recreation department leaders in Alameda County conduct-
ing like programs, was followed by several meetings at th
school with Mrs. Berrettini (occupational therapist) an
myself. Later meetings included the recreation leader and‘
parents.

The program was set Up to run eight weeks, in the after
noon, with children transported by school bus. Registra-
tion forms, sent out to students of the Sunrise School, in
cluded information regarding group experience, hobbie
and limitations Of children. Ages ranged from five tO eigh
teen, both boys and girls. The program was planned on
daily, weekly and period basis, and included a trip ever
other Wednesday, with parties on alternate weeks.

The schedule of volunteer leadership was set up, with a
average of two parents helping each day; and a committe
of three helped with tranSportation—they went on the b
to help with supervision during the trips, and the bus driver
and matron also helped.

Craft supplies (such as modeling clay) were purchased
by the United Cerebral Palsy Association. The school al-
lowed the use of all their equipment—special chairs and
tables, phonograph, records, books, paper, and so on, for
crafts. Hayward Area Recreation District furnished ath-
letic equipment.

Program—In addition to trips, this included movies, music,
dramatics, and marionettes.

Enrollment was eighteen, but attendance averaged twelve,
and total attendance by actual count was 566. Light re-
freshments, served daily in mid-afternoon, were furnished
by the United Cerebral Palsy Association and the parents.

Evaluation—The success Of the experiment was owing, in
great part, to the recreation leader. She was very interested
in the group, knew each one in it, and created an atmos-
phere Of friendliness and fun. She was a twenty-year-Old

district before her program started at Sunrise, and was ac-

perience had been as a camp counselor for three summers.

RECREATION PROGRAM FOR MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN

Planning—A meeting of the recreation superintendent with
representatives of the Association for Retarded Children of
Southern Alemeda County, the recreation chairman of the
School for Retarded Children in the San Lorenzo area, and
the representative from Fuller School in San Leandro, was
held to discuss the project.

After the advisory board approved the project, several
meetings were held to outline the needs of the children, and
the day, time, site, and volunteer leadership available. Then
there were meetings with this group, the recreation leader,
and myself to plan the detailed program of operation. (June
19 we met at the school site, toured the area, and mapped
our areas of play.) The recreation leader assigned was a
teacher in the San Lorenzo elementary schools with a special
credential in physical education. She was experienced in
crafts, low-organized games, folk dancing, dramatics, and
athletics, with special training in swimming. She had workcd
one summer for another recreation department and had been
a Girl Scout leader for one summer. She was twenty-two
years old.

Facilities, provided by the Castro Valley Elementary
School District, included a large room kindcrgarten with

lavatories adjacent), patio adjoining kindergarten room,

and regular school playground, including volleyball, basket-
ball and tetherball areas.

Program—Attendance at Chabot School was 420 by actual
count for the period of operation. Eighteen boys and girls,
agcs six to nineteen, signed up. No registration form was
sent out ahead of time, and I think this would have helped;
as it was, word was spread by parents, newspapers, and at

the Luella Fuller School.

Cooperation of the Hayward Soroptomist Club was excel-
I lent. They provided refreshments for parties every Thurs-
day, heginning the first week and concluding with a party-

Volunteer leadership, provided every day, averaged four
parents, who provided transportation.

Activities included: trips; talent show; crafts; making of
spool marionettes; record playing and listening; singing
and singing games; checkers, chinese checkers, jig saw puz-
zles; games of active and semi-active type, hoth indoors and
outdoors. Most of the games were played indoors because
of the tendency of the children to wander off. They liked
circle games, such as Dr0p the Handkerchief and Cat and
Rat, and mimetic games.

The group helped to decorate the room, using pictures
they had colored for murals around the walls. The leader
brought plants and the children cared for them and watched
them grow. A playground council was organized and helped
with the care of the room as well as with special activities.

paration for Thursday’s party.

swim program during its first week and the children, know-
ing her, were much easier to handle. The rest of the swim
instructors did an excellent ob—never showing displeasure
with the group but using a great deal of tact and patience.
After the swimming classes for this group, the children met
in Memorial Park and had a recreation program of crafts or
a short hike, or playing on the apparatus, or stories, and then
lunch.

Sisssssss . . . . . . Boom! . . . . . .Whoooooooooooooosh. They
were off in a shower of rocket sparks to make an exciting
visit to the planets of this vast universe.

The occasion for this trip was the twenty-fifth annual
playground pageant of the Austin (Texas) Recreation De-
partment, held in our City Coliseum on Wednesday, August
19, 1953.

How did we hit on a space theme? During a creative
painting session for the Southwest District Conference last
spring, one of our assistant supervisors suggested a “space”
theme for a department pageant since the boys and girls are
so space-conscious these days. That did it! Our theme was
arranged and all gears and wheels went into action for “Des-
tination Space.”

The spaceship, “Princess,” was named for a character in
a local television show andowas operated by a crew of four
children from Pan-American Recreation Center. Passengers
were six boys from the Children’s .Theatre, and Abner, the
spaceman. Abner played a very important role as it was he
who escorted the boys through the trip and protected them
from the possibly hostile planet people.

Abner is known to children of Austin through his appear-
ances on “Uncle Jay’s” television show. However, Abner
cannot communicate directly with anyone but Uncle Jay
(Jay Hodgson), who acted as narrator for the show. The
boys from Children’s Theatre came to see Uncle Jay and talk
to Abner about space. So, Uncle Jay said that he would try

to contact Abner. He eXplained that this was not his regular

time to contact him, but that he would try.

Uncle Jay was successful, and as Abner lumbered onto the
stage, dressed in a heavy asbestos fire-fighting suit with a
space helmet on his head, the boys deluged him with a

shower of Questions. Uncle Jay hushed them so he could un-
derstand what Abner was trying to communicate to him. A

Abner had said that he would take them on a trip through
space so they could see for themselves what goes on there.

The supervisor of drama for the Austin department wrote
and directed the pageant. Technical aspects of the show
were produced by Harold Klein, special events supervisor
during the summer.

The great silver spaceship, twenty feet high with a peaked
top and wings attached, was constructed by the ingenious
Will Kretschmar. “Mr. Will” is head carpenter in the de-
partment’s maintenance shop, and this was the twenty-fifth
annual playground pageant for which he built the props.

Staging of the production was accomplished by dividing
the stage into three parts. Uncle Jay and the TV studio were
down stage left; the spaceship was down stage right; and
the planet people appeared center stage. Lighting and sound
effects played a great part. The lights gave us the feeling of
whirling through space and time, while from the sound crew

came great atomic vibrations which projected our imagina-
tions into outer Space.

Bird-like creatures from Uranus, radio men from Mars,
spindly and wiggly creatures from Neptune,large round men
and triangle ladies from Pluto, weird black and white crea-
tures from Mercury, and many others were represented by
the 250 children from the seventeen playgrounds which par-
ticipated in the pageant. Costumes were created out of the
imaginations of the playground leaders and the district su-
pervisors. Most of them were from original sketches by
Mrs. Jean Kubala, North District supervisor.

Costumes were made from inexpensive and easily avail-
able materials such as paper sacks, crepe paper, cardboard
boxes, coathangers, featherboning, and cellophane. Weird,
special and out-of-the-world effects were achieved by the
imaginative use of paints. The only costumes which were
made completely of cloth were the bird-like creatures from
Uranus. These were fashioned of black cloth from head to
toe with a red comb on top of the headdress and a long yel-
low bill over the nose. Black bat-like wings completed the
costumes.

Perhaps the most unique costumes were those worn by the
Neptune peOple. These were created by making three pro-
gressive-sized hoops from coathangers. These hoops were
covered with wall canvas and strips of green crepe paper
were hung from the hoops to cover the actor’s body. Indi-
vidual battery units created lighted antennae-type eyes for
these incomprehensible creatures.

Other very interesting costumes were the ones worn by
Mercurites which were made from cardboard boxes and
brown papcr sacks. The boxes were used for the bodies and
were painted black with white markings. The paper sacks
were painted with faces and the nose holes in the sack served
as “eyes” for the person wearing it. Sacks were also used to
cover the hands and feet of the people. The legs were cov-
ered by blue jeans.

The show-must-go-on-spirit prevailed ' over the depart-
ment on the afternoon before the evening performance, as a
“Texas cloudburst” caused the removal of scenery, Space-

ship, lights, and children from the original site, at the out-
door Zilker Hillside Theatre, to the City Coliseum.

As the director tore her hair and the technician rushed
around frantically, the maintenance crews worked feverishly
to move and re-set the pageant. Publicity about the change
of location was released over local radio stations, and as
the last weary crew member slipped out of the Coliseum, the
audience began to arrive. On time, the Austin Municipal
Band began the overture, the house lights dimmed, and the
stage lights came up for the performance.

The children, with the able and experienced hclp of the
playground leaders, were made-up, dressed, assembled, en-
tered, and exited—on cuel—to entertain the two thousand
spectators who were unaware of the hectic four hours which
preceded the smoothly running show.

To carry through the theme, and to keep in touch with
Earth, the boys called Uncle Jay after each landing to report
on what they saw and what their next stop would be. An
example of Uncle Jay’s conversation follows:

“How do you feel? . . . Dizzy and air sick? Well, bettcr
chew some of that air-sick gum I gave you. How did you
like Venus? . . . A square dance? . . . That was Earth-
like. Now, in order to reach the next planet, Mars, you
will pass over Earth. . . . Oh, you see it now? How do wc
look? . . . Now you know you can’t see Texas from way up
there. Oh, I forgot to tell you that we have reason to
believe that the Martians are very radio minded and have
been trying to get in contact with Earth. It is believed

283

that they Operate an interplanetary radio relay station. . . .
You’re there? O.K. I’ll talk to you later.”
The boys were able to endure the varied climates of the

planets because of the fantastic chemical qualities of their
space helmets. These “all-purpose” helmets allowed them to
breathe, walk, live, and communicate with the planet people.

a dance, or pantomime, and refueling took place on the
Milky Way. There, a great silver hose was used to fuel the

ship, while the Big Dipper dipped candy bars out of the
Milky Way for the boys.

The dances were very simple, incorporating tumbling, bal-
let, tap, and modern dance. The Tumbling Stars of the
Milky Way were dressed in white shorts and shirts and wore
six-pointed stars. The stars were made from featherboning
covered with silver metal foil. Their entertainment of the
visitors was a variety of tumbling acts which ended in pyra-
mid formation.

As mentioned previously, a square dance was presented by
Venus. Mercury’s creatures presented a military drill and
tap routine. Saturnites performed a modern dance in which
they wore flowing white robes of cheesecloth draped over
their heads and falling to the floor. This was very eerie, and
they seemed to be dancing in space.

After each visit, the boys secretly took on board the space-
ship two of the planet creatures. Upon arriving on Earth,
they told Uncle Jay what they had done as the creatures flied
out of the spaceship for the grand finale. Uncle Jay praised
the flne looking group and called for a round of applause
from the boys and audience. Then he ushered the creatures
back on the spaceship, commanded Abner to return them to
their homes, and eXplained to the children that they must be
taken back in order to survive. The band played a farewell
song as the boys and Uncle Jay waved good-bye to the giant
spaceship speeding off with the new-found friends aboard.

RECREATION

RECREATION
and HUMAN
UNDERSTANDING

Josephine Randall

No field offers a greater opportunity for human under-
standing, respect and fellowship than does recreation. It is
on the playground and in the recreation center that the
brotherhood of man is demonstrated. How can the Spirit
engendered through games, dance, song, and arts and crafts
be captured and nourished until it is a recognized pattern
taken for granted by all?

Every race and every nation has its special characteristics
passed down through the ages. The folklore and folk tales,
the music, dance, arts and crafts, sports, dress, food and
language of each country all have their place in the culture
and the development of our present civilization.

Every playground and recreation center has a special time
for stories, music, dance, arts and crafts, and athletic activi-
ties. Mothers’ clubs are an integral part of most recreation
centers.

The influence of the recreation program through all the
various channels of clubs and special activities is far-reach-
ing. By focusing the attention of all groups, for a given
period, on one country, an intimate knowledge of that
country is acquired, resulting in friendship and a better
understanding of all the pe0ple living there.

During the storytelling period much can be done. The
storyteller can present in an interesting way the geography
of the country, the habits and customs of the people, the
folklore and the folk tales, and something about the native
language of the people. A few words can be taught, such
as words of greeting and farewell.

During the music period the national anthem and the folk
songs of the country can be sung.

In the time set aside for such activities, the national flag
can be drawn and the characteristic arts and crafts of the
country can be demonstrated and practiced.

During the drama period the native plays can be pro-
duced in costumes typical of the country.

The characteristic games and athletic events of the country
can be played during the free time on the playground.

The mothers’ club can learn how to cook a few of the
native foods of the country.

MISS RANDALL, now retired, was superintendent of recrea-
tion, City and County of San Francisco, for many years.

MAY 1954

After several weeks of experiencing the living conditions
of the chosen country, the program may culminate in a
national festival, with an invitation extended to the entire
community.

Splendid travel motion pictures of practically all countries
are available from the transportation companies.

The consul general, or his assistant, may be happy to make
a short talk about his country. The storyteller may present
one of the folk tales. The neighborhood recreation clubs
may present the music, drama, folk dances and some of the
native games. Samples of the arts, crafts and food of the
country may be on exhibit, and, if practical, the mothers’
club, with the help of the city-wide nationality society, may
serve refreshments typical of the country being presented.

The practicability of the nationality programs on play-
grounds and in recreation centers has been demonstrated
and has proved to be of great interest to the recreation par-
ticipants, who are of all ages, and to the neighborhood

groups attending the festivals.
Considerable research work must be done before the
customs of any country can be demonstrated. It is advisable

to appoint a staff member in general charge, on a city-wide
basis, who will be prepared with information and assistance
when recreation directors request nationality programs.

The value of such a program is manifold and results in a
friendly relationship that will continue throughout the lives
of those having the privilege of participating in it.

Modernize Outdoor Dramatic
Performances by Tape Plus Pantomime

Most of us get our enjoyment of any dramatic production—whether a pageant, festival, talent
show, puppet show or musical event—through a combination of SEEING and HEARING. We
find it very annoying to see that people are talking or singing, and yet not to be able to hear
what is being said.

In our outdoor productions, we usually do pretty well in seating or grouping audiences so
they can see. We haven’t done so well by them in making sure they can hear. We KNOW
that children’s voices just don’t carry. We KNOW that even the best public address systems
can’t catch all the voices when the actors are moving about the stage. W e’ve been fairly success-
ful in using narrators, letting the actors pantomime the action—but we lose part of the full

egect by this method. Something else is needed.

Here is the story of how Mr. Warren J. Higgins, drama supervisor for the Chicago Park Dis-
trict, has used tape recordings to make outdoor performances more effective, and more enjoy-
able, with practical suggestions for making the best use of this new technique.

Spring is here, and'summer is coming. Why not give this idea a whirl? Try it in your next big

outdoor performance.

TEN years ago tape recording was done only by profes-

sionals. Today many people have adopted it as a hobby
and make tape recordings of concerts, broadcasts, plays,
speeches, letters. Let’s get in on the act! A tape recorder
can play an important role in a recreation department. It
can save rehearsal time; it can point out flaws; flaws can
be erased until the result is perfect: it’s fun!

“What did he say?” “I didn’t hear that!” Don’t these
questions run through audiences time and time again? They
represent a particular problem to those groups who present
large outdoor events where a crowd of 500 to 5,000 must
hear every word or audience reaction will be lost.

If we are to have smoothness of performance audibility,
the use of tape is one solution. Tape recorders are expen-
sive but the rewards are high. How often have we presented
an outdoor pageant on the ball field (usually because there
are some bleacher seats we can utilize) or used a grassy area
that had a slope rising from the acting area for the benefit
of the audience, and arrived at the following conclusion:
There were not enough microphones to pick up dialogue
because the movement of the actors created constantly vary-
ing distances. Trying to solve the problem, we decided to
use narration with pantomime. Granted your narrator is
excellent in speech, your actors also have good voices: Is it
not a pity to lose all this good talent because of lack of
sound equipmcnt?

The average P.A. set has a phono input, and with the tape
recorder and P.A., with a pigitail to tie them both in, various
episodes of the play can be given with varied dialogue in-
stead of the constant tone and voice level of the narrator. You
may need,him several times throughout the play to tie in

286

scene changes but, even with his good narration, without
dialbgue it becomes, colorless. The variety of voices is bound
to give more life to the performance. This is true of all
productions from a puppet show to the most spectacular
pageant. The best puppetry today is not done by the operator
speaking lines and manipulating the figures too. A few
professionals still do this sort of routine, but that is a large
order to ask of the amateur.

Our audiences must be constantly given more considera-
tion. Mom and Dad say, “My, what we go through to get our
youngsters on the ‘boards’!” However, they do not mind
the time and effort if they have been entertained—and their
enjoyment depends upon whether or not they heard the play.

The fun of recording on tape has a potential. Departments
of speech recognize its value. What delight when the voices
are “played back,” but when disappointment and dissatisa
faction occur, we wipe the tape off and rehearse until the
finished “cut” is perfect!

The recreation division of the Chicago Park District an-
nually presents a number in the Tribune Music Festival in

Soldier Field with 90,000 spectators. Several years ago my
assistant and I were the pantomimists in a dramatization

of an episode in Egbert Van Alstyne’s life when he wrote
“In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree.” After a blackout we
were discovered in the middle of the field, talking while row-
ing a boat. The scene was laid on a lake in Central Park
(which was a large blue canvas with a stagehand under
each corner of it, shaking it and making waves according to
the script). Our dialogue was handled by two outstanding
radio actors on a tape recording and not a word was missed

by that vast audience!

RECREATION

Because of vacations and hot weather, many of our actors
just don’t show up for long drawn-out rehearsals. By using
tape recordings, rehearsals can be considerably shortened,
and for the actual performance the actors are faced only
with the necessity of acting and synchronizing gestures and
stage movements. Another advantage is that if the possessor
of the voice is not available for a performance someone clse
can step in and carry on.

Because of the not-too perfect synchronization of move-
lnent, mugging, musical cues and gestures, thc tempo of the
play should be a trifie slower than ordinary stage direction.
First row seats should be at least seventy-five feet or more
from thc acting area which will cover up the Split second
synchronization. Also, by keeping the first row back, the
sight lines become an easier problem.

If any scenery is used it should be done in oil. Setups are
usually done in the afternoon and a shower of rain at 6:00
P.M. would greatly damage cold-water paint. Of course,
a front curtain is not necessary. During a change of scenes,
it is a very good idea to blackout all of the acting area and

use about four Hood lights arranged to shine in the eyes of
the audience, and carry over the lapse of the short inter-
mission with a musical phonograph record.

A night production brings up the problem of lighting.
Naturally the outdoor play cannot start until darkness has
set ill. With daylight saving during July and August, that
hour is usually around 9:00 P.M. If the audience is seated
on hard seats, or on the ground, or standing up for the
occasion, the play should not be too long. Our last pageant,
“Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” had a running time of
forty-eight minutes. We tried the hour and a half perform-
ance and sadly discovered the timc to be too long.

In the final analysis, if you tape your show, it savcs time
on rehearsals, makes it a simple thing when called upon to
use a substitute pantomimist in an emergency, and the
audience will certainly follow the story, with the change of
voices giving added color to the action. Instead of the
spectators remarking upon leaving, “I didn’t hear their lines

too well,” they will say, “Heavens, the actors didn’t miss a
line!”

PLACING VOLUNTEERS

To make full use of volunteer manpower means all volun-
teers must have jobs in which they can serve to the best ad-
vantage of the organization and to the greatest satisfaction
to themselves. To place volunteers in such jobs, there must
must be a workable plan.

No good businessman would advertise for help for his
firm without knowing what positions need to be filled and
what duties are entailed in those positions. Similarly, an or-
ganization should not recruit volunteers without analyzing
the jobs that need to be done. Only then should it look for
the peOple to do those jobs.

Setting Up Jobs

Grouping functions is important if talents and skills are
to he used to best advantage. After grouping the functions,
the next step is to break up the work into manageable por-
tions, each of which can be handled by one person.

After obs have been set up, it is time to determine quali-
fications needed by volunteers to fill these obs.

Preparing Job Descriptions

After job requirements have been decided upon, a written
job description can be'.prepared and should include the
following:

1. The general nature of the work, where performed, and
for what purpose. :

2. The specific responsibilities and duties.

' 3. The time required, including specific days and hours if

(all) necessary or helpful experience; (e) needed skills and

7. The training required prior to assignment.

With a written job description in hand, workers respon-
sible for recruitment, selection, and assignment know what

kind of person to look for and what to tell the prospective
volunteer about the ob.

A true ob description must be prepared locally since it

defines a specific job in a particular center, committee or
other activity.

Relating Jobs to Pe0ple

“All this is fine theory,” some say, “but we can’t find vol-
unteers for these carefully defined jobs—we have to use
people we have and do what we can.”

It is unrealistic, surely, to h0pe that volunteers will fit
perfectly into a set pattern of needs and plan of organiza-
tion; adjustments of the ob to the person will always have
to be made. Yet this is no real argument against the im-
portance of defining needs and translating them into jobs
and job descriptions. As Lyndal Urwick, an outstanding
authority on organization, said: “Personal adjustments must
be made in so far as they are necessary. But fewer of them
will be necessary . . . if the organizer first makes a plan, a
design—to which he would work if he had the ideal human
material. He should expect to be driven from it here and
there. But he will be driven from it far less and his machine
will work more smoothly if he starts with a plan. If he starts
with a motley collection of human oddities and tries to fit
them all in, thinking first of their various shapes and sizes

and colors, he may have a patchwork quilt; he will not have
an organization.”1

Brothers, 1943, p. 37.

I IOW many workers in the field of recreation have ever

dreamed of extending recreation activities to hundreds

of thousands . . . even millions . . .

own communities do not know about the recreation facilities
already available? '

Unfulfilled dreams and frustrations need be no more; the

opportunity and the means are at hand to inform almost

everyone of the availability of recreation activities which
they do not, for one reason or another, now know about or
enjoy. The means, of course, lie in television.

It isn’t easy to talk about this medium without sounding

 

extravagant. “A new window on the world” . . . “a pipeline
from everywhere” . . . “the greatest invention for human
enlightenment since the printing press” . . . these and other
uninhibited descriptions of TV have been offered by nor-
mally conservative people.

But let’s get down to facts. Today there are over 28,000,-
000 TV receivers in American homes, and that’s over fifty
per cent of all the homes in the land. So television is rapidly
becoming a mass medium in the absolute sense. They say
that, in Chicago, there are more TV sets than bathtubs.

As to viewing habits, it is a fact that the average family
with a TV set spends more time watching that screen in the
living room than it devotes to any other leisure-time activity
-—about five and a half hours per day. Children of elementary
school age watch TV for more hours per week than they
spend in school; teen-agers average seventeen hours weekly.

Potentially, then, TV offers an unparalled opportunity to
community recreation agencies to do two things:

First, to use it as an informational 'and public relations
tool for reaching a mass audience with the story of their
facilities, activities, problems, and needs. P

Second, to use television as a technique for vastly expand-
ing their regular recreational programs by reaching into
the homes of many more people than could ever take advan-
tage of the most ideal recreation activities.

These are not idle dreams. The value of TV as a flexible
and powerful audio-visual teaching tool, both for children
and adults, already has been established clearly. In Phila-
delphia, the department of public instruction is now in its
sixth year of regular in-school telecasting to the city’s
elementary and secondary schools. There, and elsewhere,
TV has been adopted as an integral part of curriculum teach-
ing. As for adult audiences, the most extensive research has

of people? And how

many have ever felt frustrated because more people in their

been conducted by the U. S. Navy which, after seven months
of experiment at Rutgers University, concluded that stu-
dents taking their instruction via TV absorb and retain in-
formation at least as well as students taking the same course
under normal campus conditions.

School systems and other public agencies, in enough
cases to warrant generalization, have found TV of unique
value as a public relations tool to stimulate interest, under-
standing and support of their activities by the public al
large.

The pertinence of all this to the recreation field already
has been put to the test. In a number of cities, the com-

TV and the Recreatio

munity recreation agencies are employing TV today, and
some have been using it for a period of years. Several of
these programs have found sponsors, the most conspicuous
being the network-carried “Zoo Parade,” put on by the
Chicago Park District. The New Orleans Department of
Recreation also has a sponsored weekly show. Most of the
programs devoted to recreation, however, are televised dur-
ing public service time donated by local stations. As for the
opinions of the agencies which have used TV so far, here
are a few excerpts from letters on the subject:

“There is no question in my mind that television has in-
creased the interest of the public in our Jefferson County
recreation program and has caused many people who did
not know just what was arranged for them to be informed
and to go out to the playgrounds and centers and enjoy them-
selves.”—Jefferson County, Kentucky.

“We feel that the use of TV for public relations and as an
information medium is very valuable to our department . . .”
—Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

“It is my considered opinion that television is the finest
means of publicity available today . . . it is amazing the
response we receive after our many programs. I cannot urge
too strongly that recreation departments take advantage of
all possible television time for advertising their programs.”
—-—Salt Lake City, Utah.

“We have had excellent results from television. . . . We
use the medium quite extensively and next year, when'we
secure our educational channel, we are contemplating a
weekly program of Chicago Park District activities.”—Chi-
cago, Illinois.

That last sentence in the letter from Chicago brings us
to the question of non-commercial, educational TV. It was
just about two years ago that the Federal Communications
Commission reserved 242 channels, across the nation, ex-
clusively for educational, cultural and instructional pro-
gramming. Every city of more than 100,000 population has

RECREATION

such a reservatlon, as do many communities of 25,000 to
100,000 population. These stations cannot accept ad-
vertising or sell time, and their facilities must be available
to all educational and cultural institutions in the communi-
ties they serve.

The reason that the job of fulfilling the expectations of
TV as an educational and cultural force could not be left
entirely to the commercial stations is an intensely practical
one. The operation of a TV network or station is a business
enterprise, conducted for the purpose of making a profit.
Profits depend upon advertising revenue and advertising
revenue depends upon the size of the audience reached. The

most valuable programs, therefore, are those that are watched
by the greatest number of people, and the most valuable time
is when the greatest number of people are available for
television viewing. Commercial TV station owners simply
cannot afford to program for special interest groups, or
give away the valuable early evening hours. Entertainment
programming and educational programming—for this as
well as other reasons—therefore constitute complementary
television services. Both are needed and both are wanted.

The chances are that recreation agencies will continue to
program via both commercial and educational stations, and
the reason for this is inherent in the nature of their work.
Many of their activities are, at one and the same time,
instructional and entertaining, and therefore can appeal to
large enough audiences to justify some programs on com-
mercial stations. At the same time much greater opportuni-
ties for the use of television open immediately when the
facilities of non-commercial, educational stations become
available.

Take the case of Los Angeles, where the Allan Hancock
Foundation of the University of Southern California is
operating educational station KTHE. one of the first pro-
grams on the air was a children’s drama program called
“Let’s Play Like,” which is worth telling about in some
detail. It is produced by Foy Va_n Dolsen, a drama instruc-
tor on the staff of the Los Angeles County Department of
Recreation and Parks. Last summer Van Dolsen attended a
ten-day workshop for community leaders conducted at the
studios of KTHE, which had not yet gone on the air. This
suggested to him the transfer to TV of the unrehearsed and
informal play-acting that he had been conducting in the Los
Angeles public parks. The idea won immediate approval.

Van Dolsen’s formula is simplicity itself. Each day he
selects a.children’s play and requests the supervisor of
one of the public playgrounds to come to the studio with a
specified number of children within a given range of ages.

MAY 1954

The first time Van Dolsen lays eyes upon his cast is when the
children show up at 7:00 P.M. At 7:15 he gathers them
together in the studio and begins talking about the fun of
play-acting. At 7:30 they are on the air. Van Dolsen then
announces his choice of a play, summarizes the plot very
briefly, and asks the children to choose parts. Then he pulls
out a set of simple, even crude, costumes and props which
have been whipped up in the art department in the course
of the day, and the children start struggling into their cos-
tumcs. From that moment on, they are practically oblivious
of cameras and lights.

With casual nudging from the instructor, the play begins.
If all goes well, Van Dolsen drifts off camera and stays
there until the kids get stuck. If things bog down, he re-
appears and gives them another start. When the “play”
has run its course, they all sit down again and talk things
over.

In the closing part of the conversation, Van Dolsen makes
his major pitch: play-acting is fun . . . and it can be done

almost anywhere . . . in the attic, the garage, anywhere that
is agreeable to the parents . . . costum'es can be made by the
children themselves . . . why not form a neighborhood group
and put on plays regularly?

 

Mr. Dolsen, drama instructor of Los Angeles County play-
grounds, on stage with two of the principals in a spontan-
eous, unrehearsed TV version of fairy tale, “Cinderella.”

I

Thus, via TV, Van Dolsen performs one of the major
functions of recreation leadership—the springboard, the
stimulus to self-perpetuating group activity. His show is
now in its sixth month and is going stronger than ever.

When and where will the new educational stations be
coming on the air? By the end of this month (May), there
will be seven or eight telecasting regularly. The University
of Houston’s station was the first; then came Los Angeles,
which made its bow at the end of November, to be followed
by the Michigan State College’s station at East Lansing in
January. Before this month is out, it is expected that Pitts-
burgh, San Francisco and Madison (Wisconsin), and per-
haps Cincinnati will be added to the list. Another group of

291'

 

between ten and twenty stations will turn on the lights early
next fall; and after that there should be steady accretions to
the educational TV world. Some fifty communities have
applied to the FCC for construction permits, and there is
some degree of organizational activity in at least 120 com-
munities.

But all who have worked with community organizations
know that “some degree of organizational activity” is not
necessarily a guarantee of imminent success. Let’s face it:
to organize a community association for such a complex and
technical task as building and operating a television station,
and then to go out and raise anywhere from a couple of
hundred thousand to a million dollars is hard work, and
often slow going.

Last August the National Recreation Association ac-
cepted a position on the Advisory Council to the National
Citizens Committee for Educational Television. The Advisory
Council now numbers eighty-odd national organizations, all
of which have endorsed the aims of educational television
and agreed to work in all appropriate ways for its realiza-
tion. It is natural that the NRA should identify itself with
this movement because of the great opportunities offered
to the recreation movement and because the community
groups sponsoring educational stations are normally the
groups with which recreation agencies traditionally have
coOperated in community projects.

There are several types of activity in which state, county,
and municipal recreation agencies can assist in furthering
the cause of educational TV:

1. Helping to initiate community support in over a hun-

dred places where no discernible movement to use the chan-
nels reserved for educational TVthas taken shape to date.
The FCC reservations may not be good forever; if a com-
munity shows no interest in the channel reserved for
educational TV, the FCC might well release it to a commer-
cial applicant.

2. Joining and assisting educational TV associations in
fund campaigns and the-wide variety of jobs that have to be
done before a station can go on the air.

3. Programming. This is of the utmost importance for,
in the final analysis, it is in the quality and value of the
programs presented that educational television will reach or
fall short of its shining goals. Every community recreation
agency in the country can be considered as a resource for
television programs. The first thing is to call this fact to the
attention of those who are interested actively or potentially
in community educational TV, for it is not safe to assume
that pe0ple are aware of the program resources that lie at
their finger tips. The next thing is to start, very early in
the game, definite plans for specific programs and program
series. Television programming is a complicated business
technically, but even more important is the conception and
detailed planning that must go into really successful tele-
casts.

By nature and training, workers in the reci‘eation field
have experience and talent that is likely to be valuable
background for TV work. It is up to them to accept this
unprecedented challenge to use educational TV to promote
and extend the constructive use of leisure time through

recreation activity.

 

Softball Round-Up

Our Softball Round-Up on the Iowa City, Iowa, play-
grounds, last summer ust grew!

We couldn’t credit any one playground director with
the idea; it was a cooperative effort on the part of all of us
as we discussed what we could do for our final playground
week.

The last week of playground activity had been captioned
“Round-Up Week.” During this week a concerted effort was
to be made to tie together any loose ends of the activities,
with the hope that this would make the whole summer’s
play a more worthwhile eXperience.

The playgrounds had enjoyed a very successful softball
season, with each playground fielding at least two teams in
inter-playground competition. A week before our meeting,
at the conclusion of the round-robin play, one of the play-
grounds had sponsored an all star tournament in which the
best hoys from each playground, regardless of team, repre-
sented their playground. Thus the traditional types of com-
petition had been exhausted; and what to do to “round-
up” the season seemed a problem indeed! '

We needed something new. Something which would even

to win; something which would provide new teams so that
the feeling of competition between playgrounds would be-
come one of cooperation; something which would give
everyone an equal opportunity to play; something which
would emphasize the fun of play instead of the pressure of
winning and loosing. We feel that we found that “some-
thing” in the Softball Round-Up. Here is a brief list of
rules, with some modifications, based on our first year’s
experience:

1. Everyone who wants to play softball is registered.

2. Playground directors seed their players into “poor” and “good”
groups.

3. Teams are formed by drawing an equal number of players from
each group.

4. Teams are designated by number.

5. Team number one begins at bat; team number two takes the field.
6. One inning is played and the winner stays on to meet the next team.
7. The oncoming team always takes the field.

8. In case of a tie, the'teams play a maximum of three innings. If
at that time the tie still exists, both teams are eliminated.

9. No team may face more than three teams in succession. In the
event that it wins against its third opponent, both teams, are elimi-
nated and two new teams take the field.

10. The batting order is resumed at the previous inning’s point of
departure. No changes may be made in the batting order.

playgrounds depicted the “old woman who lived in a shoe.”

 

7N an effort to secure more of the interest and active par-

ticipation of industrial plants in the local recreation
program, in Auburn, New York, and also to further educate
the community about products manufactured in the city, a
playground festival parade with “Industrial Auburn” as
its theme was held as a part of the playground program in
the summer of 1952—and was repeated in 1953.

The superintendent of each manufacturing firm was
asked to send a representative to a preliminary meeting
where suggestions were discussed and definite plans for the
parade established. This was done about a month before
the regular playground season started so that, during our
playground training institute, the idea could be described
in detail and each of the fourteen playgrounds could choose
one of the cooperative industries.

Each company taking part provided a truck and driver
and assisted in deciding on a theme which could be depicted
lin a float. The recreation department furnished all decor-
ating materials with the children, under the supervision of
directors, doing the actual work.

The idea was very popular for everyone concerned; and
the parade, held during the next to last week of the regular
playground season, drew several thousand spectators as it
made its course through the downtown section. It was gen-
erally felt that the objectives of the parade were achieved—-
with the children having had an unusual recreation and

ducational experience, and a generous portion of good will
eveloped with the business establishments who took part.

Many floats with the “Industrial Auburn” theme com-

osed a large part of the parade, and the locally-made prod-
cts received their share of attention from the folks who

lined the curb; but it was the youngsters atop, in front,
behind and beside the uniquely decorated trucks who were
the real centers of attraction. They were attired in costumes
ranging all the way from dainty white dresses for little girls
to stalwart pioneer outfits for boys. Pets, constant com-
panions to the children, were not overlooked.

Dogs, one decked out in a hula collar and skirt, were in
line, apparently enjoying the attention they attracted. A
decorated donkey had a place in the parade and a live cow
looked mildly down from atop a float. On another truck was
a life-like replica of bOssy.

Motorcycle officers preceded the parade and with other
Auburn police exercised special caution against mishaps.

Music was supplied by a youthful Cayuga County band
and by the calliope of the John Pawling Ring Circus. Clowns
capered around the calliope at the end of the parade. The
Stars and Stripes led the parade and were carried by color
bearers at the head of most of the sections.

Among the many gay exhibits, there were the “old woman
who lived in a shoe” and her numerous children, Daniel
Boone in his buckskins, the acrobatic cow that jumped over
the moon, the hula girls in their rope costumes, and others
equally appropriate. Slogans showed the predominant
notes of a youthful assembly such as “Youth of Today the
Pioneers of Tomorrow,” and “We Have Faith in Auburn.”

First in line was the Bradford Playground with the Gen-
eral Electric exhibit stressing the part played in the lives
of Americans by radio and television. Children on the truck
represented some of the radio and TV favorites. A donkey
bore the sign “I was at Chicago.” The elephant who “was
at Chicago also” failed to arrive in time. The little donkey
provided the laugh highlight of the parade when it refused
to go any further as the procession got to Osborne Street.
Six husky men pushed it from behind. It didn’t budge. The
parade moved on. Still the little animal stayed in the same
place; and it was still there long after the procession ended.

Capitol Playground showed, in a pioneer days setting,
some of the part played in industry by American Locomotive
Company. “Children—America’s greatest possession,” a
banner on the truck proclaimed.

A calf, many turkeys and chickens, surrounded by chil-
dren, were on the Beacon Milling Company float; while the
“magic carpet” of fairytale fame represented the First Carpet
Company. Many other original, entertaining floats and fea-

tures representing cooperative community contributions took

part in this gala community enterprise.

RAILROAD
EXCURSION

 

THE FOLLOWING account of what started out to be a small
group of children on a short train trip, and resulted in a
one-day migration to a state park beach, will highlight some
of the important incidents related to the planning and con-
ducting of that trip.

Origin of the Idea: The trip resulted from a comment by
Waldo Hainsworth, NRA field representative, about a group
of children in Torrington taking a short train ride as a new
program idea. The thought occurred to us that surely a trip
on a train through beautiful New Hampshire would be
equally appealing to Concord children. The idea Was first

A Boston and Maine conductor with his assist- discussed at a “766le Staff meeting 0f Playground directors

8d hm] m conecmlg hekets from passengers' at each other as if to say, “What is he planning next?” Each
was asked to query possible participants in his area, to see
if there were any interest in such a trip. The response
seemed favorable.

 

Arranging for Tran5portation: The next step seemed to be
to get in touch with a representative of the Boston and Maine
Railroad. The public-relations official was coolly receptive
to a suggestion that special cars might be put on for a one-
day playground trip to Lake Sunapee State Park. He agreed,
however, to get in touch with the Boston oflice, and to report
the reaction. Within a few days he sent a railroad repre-
sentative to the oflice of the recreation and park department
to discuss the matter. When asked how many we thought we
might have for such a trip, we stated that we might have
as many as eighty, or enough to fill one complete car. He
mopped his brow and said that would require an extra car to
be put on at Boston for the run. (The regular run usually
consisted of one car plus a mail car.) After spending many
hours on the telephone and a long hour and a half in the

 

This is typical of the cars filled with playground parti-
cipants. Children totalled over 400, some dressed as bums. .

rfiice of Mr. A. W. Malloy, New Hampshire Division super-

ntendent of B 8: M, we finally agreed on a plan to sell special
educcd rate tickets at each of the playgrounds for the trip.
f we had more than enough passengers to fill one car we
rould notify the B & M. Mr. Malloy was very dubious about
my suggestion that the group be allowed to make an inspec-
ion of the big diesel engine prior to leaving the station. He
grced to think it over. He also agreed to think over a pro-
Iosition that we elect honorary train officials to act as con-
uctor, brakeman, engineer and fireman for the day.

Treating Interest: Posters were made for each playground
nd radio and newspaper announcements advertised the date
f the trip. Interest seemed to be growing; but, until tickets

rere sold, it was anyone’s guess as to how many would take
me trip.

't'nal Plans: After a lot of speculation, over a period of
everal weeks, we started to sell tickets and soon realized
lat we would have no trouble filling not only one railroad
ar but, perhaps, cven two cars. We got in touch with Mr.
[alloy and he listened with interest when we said we thought
'e would need at least two cars. He also “complained” about
1e announcement that we were selecting the honorary con-
uctor, fireman, brakeman and engineer. He wondered why
1ey had not included the superintendcnt! i! Wc hurriedly
tumbled something about not thinking the B 8: M superin-
rndent would be interested in the idea . . . or words to that
Ffect’. . . and immediately announced that an honorary rail-
)ad superintendent would be selected. Ticket selling con-
nued. Two weeks before the trip, an estimate indicated
[at more than two hundred would make the trip. Hurried
lllS to the B StM office were made requesting additional cars.
At the last staff meeting, it was found that Rolfe Park (at
Le north end of town) would fill one car itself. This pre-

‘nted the problem of how to get so many children to the
ation. But word got around and, within twenty-four hours,

a collection had been taken in the neighborhood and two
buses were chartered to transport the Rolfe Park youngsters
the seven miles to the station and back.

It was decided that with such a large group, it might be
well to close the playgrounds so that the entire playground
staff would be available for supervision. Staff committees ‘
were appointed to plan for ticket sales and money, program
for the day, the ceremony of installing the honorary train-
men at the station prior to embarking, inspecting the engine,
taking roll enroute, first aid, lost and found, and guarding
the water front while at the beach.

The Big Day: A last-minute summary of ticket sales threw
the entire staff into a “tizzy.” Over 450 tickets had been
sold, with indications that more would be disposed of at the
station at the last moment. It had been announced that chil-
dren under six would have to be accompanied by a parent,
although two members of the playground staff were selected
to head up plans for the “tot-gang” (supervision and care
enroute and program upon arrival). Hurried calls to the
railroad for still more cars put the finishing touches on a
gradually-increasing interest on the part of the B 8: M of-
ficials. The railroad representative announced that he was
cutting his vacation short and would makeithe trip with the
children. Mr. Malloy announced that the public relations
man from the Boston office would go along to take pictures.
He also insisted on drawing up the “charges” to be made by
Mayor Shelby 0. Walker and himself at the installation cere-
mony of the honorary trainmen. Special badges and hats

were rounded up to be worn for the occasion. “Impossible”
suggestions to switch the diesel engine in position for an in-

spection were found to be much easier to carry out than at
first consideration.

At 9:15 A.M., children from all sections of Concord des-
cended on the State House Plaza and formed in orderly but
noisy and excited playground groups, each with a huge “con-

vention-type banner.” Several playgrounds had decided to
dress up in bums’ costumes for the trip. The recreation and
parks department station wagon, with public address system
mounted on top, played lively music on records until time to
parade. Then, headed by a motorcycle escort, station wagon,
and drum majorettes, over five hundred children from the
city’s playgrounds marched down the center of Main Street
while hundreds of shoppers, bankers, office workers and tour-
ists stood and watched the array of excited youngsters
dragging sweaters, lunches in all forms, water balls, cameras,
pets, swimming suits and towels.

Upon arrival at the station, all were assembled around a
baggage car as Mayor Shelby 0. Walker greeted Mr. Malloy
and thanked him for his cooperation. The honorary train-

296

men, two girls and three boys, were introduced to their real
counterparts of B & M as they were sworn in, badges pinned
on and trainmen’s hat placed on their heads. Pictures of the
officials were taken as plans immediately got underway to
start the five hundred children through the train. At this
point we had our first setback. The diesel could be entered
only by climbing up a ladder and crawling in a small door;
then it was necessary to move through a narrow passageway
along the tremendous engine. The tallest male staff members
took positions next to the ladder and boosted each and every
one of the five hundred children up the ladder, first attempt-
ing to hand a conglomeration of packages, lunches falling
apart, and so on, to a leader in the engine. All of this with
frantic efforts to get the last few children up the ladder to
complete the inspection and have the “all aboard” on
schedule.

The trip to Lake Sunapee was a gay one, with few of the
youngsters keeping their seats for long. It was a dynamic,
chattering, laughing, moving gang having the time of their
lives. Aside from using up all of the paper cups and a bit
of water throwing, all went well. People in the villages along
the way were amazed to see the string of five railroad cars
filled to capacity with children. Few could remember a train
of more than a car or two passing through their town.

Upon reaching Lake Sunapee, the train was quickly
emptied and the children headed for the beach a quarter of
a mile away. Lifeguarding had been carefully planned, with
seven lifeguards supplementing the state park guards. Every.
one went in for a fifteen-minute dip, then a signal sounded
for lunch. Each had his own food; some made fires and
cooked hot dogs and hamburgers; some had already con-
sumed their lunches enroute.

The day passed quickly with beach ball, volleyball, tag,
lolling in the sun, eating refreshments (the state park stand
sold out for the only time during the entire summer) and
just plain having a good time. It was filled with amusing
incidents, but one of the funniest was the story of the boy
who spent the entire afternoon gathering up pop bottlcs in
a shopping bag and lugging them back the quarter of a mile

to the train, and thence to Concord.
It was a tired group that trouped down the road and

waited for the B & M diesel to roll into view for the trip
home. Within seconds all five hundred were aboard and
settled ( ?) for the return trip.

The city hummed with conversation that night, and for
days afterward, about the trip that started out as a littlc idca
and grew into a mass excursion. We considered the outing
a huge success. Perhaps nothing we did the whole summer
made people sit up and take so much notice of the recreation
and parks department and the value of its planned sunnncr
playground programs.

RECREATION ‘

INDIAN WEEK

Wild Indian cries, Indian dances, and many other tribal
customs of the American Indians were witnessed in Barre,
Vermont, during the week of July 13-17 last year. The Barre
Recreation Department, under the direction of Guido Tar-
quinio, dcvoted one of its weekly playground themes to the
American Indians and their customs. “Indian Week” pro-
vided thrills-a-plenty for all the youngsters who took part
in the program, and to say that it went over big with the
children is an understatement!

The five playgrounds in the Barre area were given indi-
vidual tribe names for the week; the Iroquois, Sioux,
Apaches, Cherokees, and the Blackfeet. During the previous
week each playground held an election for its own chief,
head squaw, and medicine man. The history, customs, and
legends of the tribes were re-enacted with all the play-
grounders learning at least two or three different basic In-

dian ceremonial dances. The children not only were enthusi- '

astic, but they did an excellent job with the various dances.
The age group was from four to fifteen.

At the beginning of the week, tepees, stone fireplaces, and
lean-tos were constructed on all playgrounds. One play-
ground had as many as twelve tepees. The children madc
their own Indian bracelets, headdresses, and neck pieces.
Each tribe made tom-toms and peace pipes, and one play-
ground even made a totem pole. The crafts for Indian Week
were the making of breechcloths and headbands from pieces
of sheets, necklaces and bracelets from colored macaroni,
spears, clubs, tomahawks, and shields.

The big event of the week was an evening powwow which
was preceded by a parade. This included a float with a tepee
as decoration and two chiefs and the various members of
their council on it. Two horseback riders dressed in Indian
costumes accompanied the group of children who snake-
danced behind the float. At the site of the powwow was an
altar-type council fire with big logs around the outside,
making the council ring. The Sioux reservation had tepees
in a circle around the fireplace with the tepee of Chief Sit-
ting Bull at the head. The ceremonies started with the chief
asking the braves to do a hunters’ dance. The braves then
assembled and danced around the fire giving blood-curdling

NIAY 1954

 

cries and whoops. Meanwhile, the squaws sat at one end of
the circle and chanted an Indian song. These chants were
made up by the playgrounders.

Following the hunters’ dance the chief called for four of
the most honorable braves to come and smoke the pipe with
him. When they were seated around the chief, the medicine
man came racing out of his tepee carrying the “pipe of
peace” and danced around the fire to drive off the evil
spirits. Then he laid the end of the pipe in the fire to warm
it up and presented it to the chief. Each brave in turn
smoked the pipe which, of course, was not really lighted.
After this, the chief asked that food be prepared for the
tribes. The braves and squaws then cooked their own food
(marshmallows) over the fire.

Following the feast, the chief asked the braves to do the
rain dance, as it had not rained for weeks. The braves
gathered and danced around each tepee so that each family
would be assured of good crops. After the rain dance the
chief told the tribe many legends and facts of the mighty
Sioux.

This type of program had wide appeal, not only for the
small children, but for the larger ones as well. Many of the
older fellows deserted their ball playing to build tepees, lean-
tos, and fireplaces. They all wanted to take part in the In-
dian program. '

This was one of the Barre Recreation Department’s most
successful events in years and will be a part of the program
next year. Playground leaders everywhere will find that the
American children of today are very much interested in the
first- true American, the Indian.

NOTE—A special session on Indian lore was one of the
features of the Vermont Playground Leaders’ Training lnsti-
tute, held in June 1953 at Aloha Manor on Lake Morey,
under the sponsorship of the State Board of Recreation and
the Vermont Recreation Society. James Fearon, summer rec-
reation director of Lyndonville, Vermont, and a Springfield
College graduate, conducted the session and started a wave
of Indian enthusiasm which has resulted in many a tepee,
war dance and powwow on the playgrounds of Vermont
this summer.

Playground Field Trips

E. Laurence Palmer

THERE WAS A TIME when school build-
ings were used almost exclusively for
daytime classes. Now they are used for
night classes, for election booths, for
community affairs and for Parent-
Teachers Association meetings.

Today, playgrounds are used for ath-
letic events, for games, for physical rec-
reation and, in many instances, for cre-
ative and cultural activities. Tomorrow,
they may be put to further use as the
sites for field trips that require no
transportation time or expense and yet
may provide more fruitful experience
than many elaborate field trips now be-
ing held. There is hardly a playground
in the country that cannot yield experi-
ences with all the major groups of
plants and of animals; that does not
provide spectacular, though miniature,
examples of the major land forms con-
sidered in physical geography. These
mighty, milimeter mountains are seen
by few; and yet they provide the set-
tings for little deserts, lakes, forests and
grasslands whose recognition and un-
derstanding can well lead to a sane ap-
preciation of the significance of the
major ecological areas of the world. In
any playground, there are spots that are

The playing field is a good site for a playground natural history trip. Here
there is considerable variation in the plant eover, in the acidity of the soil,

the light intensity and in eonipaeting influences. All these make good studies.

never touched directly by the sun, where
there is great variation in temperature,
humidity, exposure to violence of wind,
animals, vehicles and moving water.

To illustrate our point, let us look at
our first picture. A football game was
going on when this photograph was
taken; have you noticed that some
plants can survive the vigors of these
games while others cannot? (Knowl-
edge of this sort is valuable to men who
plan athletic fields, airfields and play-
grounds. A bare spot may cause a slip
that might lose a game or affect the
bound of a ball and determine a vic-
tory.)

What can you read into this particu-
lar picture? If it was taken in the
afternoon, was it early or late afternoon
and was player number 54 (point 3)
going towards a north or a south goal?
A white streak, or line for field mark-
ing, shows at point 4. Obviously this
is different from the surrounding ter-

ritory. I once talked to over two hun-
dred teachers who were sitting on the
bleachers of an athletic field. I collected
some plants growing on ,one of these
white lines and asked delegates to find
similar plants and to stand on them.
They all stood on the lines; none of
them found these plants growing be-
tween the lines. It was simple, from
this, to show that these plants required
a higher lime content than the other
plants on the field, and to suggest that
if many of these plants are needed on a
particular field, it might be well to add
lime. This led to a general discussion
and demonstration of the effect of acid-
ity and alkalinity of soils. Undoubtedly
some playgrounds will show the effects
of salinity as well. The amount of sun
reaching the soil may also affect the
nature of things living there.
Frequently, fields such as this are
bordered hy dcep holes in which the
poles of banners are thrust. Drop a few

thermometers on strings down into
these holes and let the group on the
blcachcrs guess how much temperatures
vary at the soil surface and at various
.depths beneath. Make a few guesses
yourself—but not aloud and before a
large audience, you might be embar-
rassed.

Examination of the earth in a field
such as we have here will probably show
the castings made by burrowing earth-
worms. Are these more or less abun-
dant on the litned areas? What other
variations in the nature of the soil are
indicatcd by the variation in the abund-
ance of these animals? Are they more
abundant in the playing area or out-
side of it?

In our second picturc, a quiet game
of horseshoes is in progress. What
might be more interesting are the bare,

erosion of the soil as shown in this pic-
ture. Notice how it is banked around

Even the small shrubs shown around
point 5 have the qualities of forest
lands. There is a can0py of leaves above
a relatively open understory. The litter
under these plants shows variations in
decay from that seen in the Open. The
light intensity varies under and outside
of them. The soil will rcmain moist be-
neath them differently than outside. In
this lawn may be found representatives
of the major groups of animals from
worms through mollusks, insects, spid-
ers and so on. Birds, like robins, haunt
such places in search of their special
worm food, and toads and garter snakes
have undoubtedly been found in such
areas as representatives of the cold-
blooded animals.

Studies of the way the light falls on
the poles and posts should be useful in
training students to locate direction
without a compass. Assuming that this
was taken in the afternoon, the posts at
point 4—illuminated as they are on one
side—should help give some idea of di-
rection, and the length of the shadows
should suggest something as to the near-
ness to noon. [1t is fun to practice tell-

Since many of our youths entering
military service may find themselves in
situations where knowledge of compass
directions may be of life and death im-

portance, studies such as are here sug-
gested may be worthwhile.

If we look at the center of activity of
the game wc can see dust ind-the air.
From this we can get some igea about
wind direction and velocity and, of
course, observc loess in the making.

If an area is paved with blacktop and
the adjacent areas are paved with ce-
ment or gravel or loose earth, which are
the hottest? Which dry most quickly
after a rain? What behavior of bare-
foot boys indicates temperature varia-
tions? Do these same variations hold
for these areas at night? Check what
you decide by using thermometers.

These paved areas are really little
deserts where thcre arc great and sud-
den variations in temperature and hu-I
midity as compared to ground covered
with plants. You do not need to go
miles to determine this. Put your bare
hand on as many places as can be found
in such a situation to determine which
are the hottest or the coolest spots, or
watch the behavior of dogs to see if this
helps in such a study.

Pavements and sidewalks are always
interesting studies for short field trips.
Within one block of my house I was
able to identify the trees along my path
without once looking up. In the picture
shown here we see not only the leaves
of maple, basswood and pine but the
winged fruit clusters of basswood. The
cracks in the walk provide avenues
through which water may enter the
ground. Ants also use these avenues and
find, at a few inches down, comfortable
temperatures not available to them on
the concrete surface. In early morning,
such walks may be marked with the
shining mucus trails of slugs. Some of
these mollusks get caught on the side-
walk desert during the heat of the day
and fail to get to a haven provided by
the bordering vegetation. (Human be-
ings not infrequently have similar ex-
periences in larger, more remote des-
erts.) Help your children to see and
identify these things.

I have found much pleasure in mak-
ing weed shadow silhouettes as they ap-
pear along the edges of sidewalks. The
illustrations should suggest a few pos-
sibilities along these lines. [These
should provide interesting designs for
crafts projects.—Ed.]

I contend that, until we' have ex-

Sidewalks often present excellent laboratories for
outdoor study, displaying leaves for inspection and
identification. Maple leaves are most conspicuous in

hausted the possibilities of our immedi-
ate environment, it is rather futile to
attempt to take long field trips that are
expensive in time, eiiort, money and re-
sponsibility. I believe thoroughly that
any playground properly used can pro-
vide an abundance of opportunity for
improving our ability to think and to
observe the exciting things about us. I
see no reason why we should worry
about the situation on Mars when we

cannot understand the situation on the
First Street Playground, Ourtown, U.
S.A. Are you making the most of the
opportunities of your playgrounds?
There is no reason why children
should be denied the superior oppor-
tunities provided by teaching by the
field trip method simply because the
school bus has broken down. I once at-
tended a training course for teachers’
college faculties, and heard the respon-

chicory and yarrow are found from left to right in
picture four; timothy, ragweed and pepper grass
in picture five; and sweet clovcr in picture number six.

sible parties get out of taking a re-
quested field trip simply for this reason.
The school was surrounded by lawns,
playgrounds, pools, groves and steep
banks that WPA workers had been un-
able to anchor with a grass cover; but,
apparently, none of these phenomena
was legitimate study for a field trip.
This, mind you, in a school training
teachers of teachers. Please get out and
get acquainted with your own yard.

“I should wish all my children to be sensitive to all those aspects of earth and sky that can move the soul
with loveliness and sublimity. . . . Certainly I should like them to be at home with Nature’s infinite vari-
ety; to love not merely her verdure and blossoming but her mystic mists and yellow decay. . . . I think
I should have a course in nature running pleasantly through my children’s years.”

EACH YEAR, you, as a recreation di-
rector, most likely look back on your
summer playground season and cons-
ciously or unconsciously evaluate it on
the basis of how it compared to other
years.

Although attendance has been used
by recreation directors from the incep-
tion of the playground movement, I
sometimes wonder whether attendance
records are true thermometers of how
p0pular our program has been. Attend-
ance figures are of value, however, if
they are accurately kept, and if the at-
tendance count is taken at regular inter-
vals each day.

I should like to suggest that you de-
velop a graph based on your weekly at-
tendance records. Make the graph large
enough, so that your playground lead-
ers can see it each week or whenever
you hold your institute. It will develop
a competitive spirit among your leaders.
It will rule out erroneous figures which
would cause the graph to fluctuate to a
greater degree than would be normal.

We have kept our graphs for several
years now, and find that a similar pat-
tern is followed each year. The graphs
show a large attendance the beginning
of the season; a falling off after the
Fourth of July; and a steady rise for a
period of time until vacation time, when
it dr0ps again, and continues to drop
to the end of the season. We have told
our leaders that the best graph is one

of recreation in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

which has as level a plane as possible,
or a consistent, steady attendance. We
feel that this indicates good leadership,
provided such factors as vacation time,
weather, or special events outside of our
own program do not cause the graph to
fluctuate.

One line of your graph should be des-
ignated “average attendance.” I sin-
cerely feel that using the attendance in
this manner is of much greater value
than stating at the end of the season that
“this is the greatest season—we had this
or that thousand or more spectators and
participants in our summer playground
program.” You will finally arrive at an
astronomical figure which will be hard
to ustify.

One of the best methods of evaluating
your summer playgrounds is to require
your playground leaders to file a final
report. That report, coupled with the
final report of your supervisors, gives
the director an opportunity to evaluate
the program and personnel from an ob-
j ective point of view. Some of our most
outstanding program events and im-
provements have come about from the
constructive criticism in the leaders’
and supervisors’ final reports. The fol-
lowing headings are suggestions for
final reports:
games; quiet games; memory and sense

your low organized
training games; story hour; high or-
ganized games; athletics and meets;
sand box work; handcraft; use of facili-
ties; methods of self government; bul-
letin boards; special events; neighbor-
hood playground patrons; attendance;

and suggestions.

It is suggested that the final report
contain snapshots, or that illustrations
be used to better explain what the sea-
son’s activities were. The following are
several excerpts from an actual report:

“The success of our season at Moose
Playground is evident by the large at-
tendance which remained at an almost
constant level during the entire season.
The large attendance can probably be
attributed to the fact that we had enough
activities to keep the general crowd of
playground-goers interested every day
during the summer.”

“The children were anxious to play
low organized games any time during
the day, but I found that the best time
was from about ten until eleven, in the
mornings, and after handcraft in the
afternoons. On several occasions the
children had enough initiative to start
the games when I was busy with other
projects.”

“I found the best time for stories was
following active games in the morning.
The age range of people who listened to
stories was usually between four and
twelve. Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Kip-
ling’s Just So Stories were the most
popular. The ‘Story Lady’ was always
well accepted, especially by the younger
children.”

“Arts and crafts were under excellent
supervision this year. The introduction
of such a variety of projects stimulated
interest among the children of all ages.
We spent from one and a half to two
hours after dinner on handcraft each

RECREATION

day. Because the younger children
couldn’t do the same projects as the
older children, I Spent Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons working with
them on such projects as yarn dolls,
paper sculpture, hand puppets, sewing,
and similar projects.

“Although we had a lot of children
working on it, I had the feeling that our
woodworking was not well organized,
perhaps because most of the children
seemed to be working just for the fun of
using a saw, rather than to gain skill in
making something constructive and
useful.”

If our summer playground program
can be adjudged successful, it is because
of our handcraft program. We consider
it the most basic phase of the summer
activities and build our entire program
around the handcraft program.

Our most outstanding special event
is known as Park and Recreation Day,
for which boys and girls construct many
candle-lighted lanterns which they carry
into a natural-bowl amphitheater. The
lantern parade is usually preceded by
short, live-minute skits presented by
each playground. The report stated:

“Judging by the reaction of Moose’s
children, the lantern festival was defi-

 

Reprinted from Wisconsin Recreation Asso-
ciation Bulletin, September 25, 1953.

nitely a major success both as a valu-
able learning experience and because
each child had the satisfaction of mak-
ing his own lantern. A young child’s
lantern may have been no more than a
cut-out cardboard box covered with
crepe paper, but it gave the creator 3
sense of accomplishment in completing
his own lantern.

“It is suggested that the assembly line
method of producing lanterns be dis-
couraged. It is true that by choosing a
group of older, efiicient children and
setting up a production line, it is possi-
ble for a playground to manufacture
impressive lanterns by the hundreds;
but how can that compare with the joy
of a group of youngsters who work, al-
though slowly, to be able to carry lan-
terns made by themselves? The pur-
pose of the festival is to occupy as many
children as possible in a project that will
give them an experience in designing
and constructing, and an Opportunity to
exhibit the results of their own work.
The purpose is not to train a few assem-
bly line workers.”

This playground leader, in giving her
own self-analysis, gives the director an
insight into her motives and reasons for
accepting a playground job; gives him a
means of deciding whether he should
re-hire her for the coming year; and

NEW HYDBANT SPRAY CAP

NEW TYPE of hydrant shower de-
A signed by the department of water
supply, gas and electricity of New York
was used extensively in the city’s streets
last summer. The device was especially
welcome because use of the hydrants for
street showers had been forbidden for
several years because of the water short-
age. The accompanying diagram of the
spray cap illustrates the manner in which
the holes have been drilled and shows
how the water is directed upward in a
wide spray. Caps were drilled by the
department force. The spray is de-
scribed by the commissioner as follows:

“Our standard hydrant has two noz-

MAY 1954

zles, one 2%-inch and one 441/2-inch.
The larger one was used to produce a
better spray.

“This sprinkler cap replaces the 41/2-
inch cap on the hydrant when a spray
is desired.

“As the threads on the caps and noz-
zles do not all start at the same point,
two different thicknesses of rubber gas-
kets (5/32 inch and 5/ 64 inch) were
furnished with each cap, thus any cap
could be made tight with the spray holes
lined up on the upper half of cap.

“The estimated How of water through
the cap is twenty-live gpm at forty
pounds pressure.

gives the director an opportunity of
evaluating his own goals and objectives:

“. . . I’d like to say that I sincerely
enjoyed working at Moose Playground.
In my opinion, it is an ideal playground,
for it gives one the opportunity to work
with all types of people. There are chil-
dren attending of all ages and from
‘both sides of the track,’ learning to
work and play together. For each co-
operative, well-behaved child, there is
another who is neglected, delinquent,
much in need of guidance and trust.
Because of the great extremes in human
nature and in age range at Moose, it
could well be considered the hardest
playground to work at. And yet, it can
also be called the best, for its great ver-
satility creates many opportunities in
all fields of recreation. I certainly feel
I’ve learned much from my experience
at Moose Playground, and would indeed
be pleased if I could apply this knowl-
edge by spending another season there.”

In conclusion, therefore, I feel that
if we, as recreation directors, can look
back on a playground season and can
appraise it, not on the basis of how
many attended, but on how much in the
way of democratic fundamentals and
how much in the way of Christian ideals
Was attained, we can feel that we have
obtained satisfactory results.

Health Education

in a Recreation Program

(E ‘29))

IN WHAT John S. Nagy, commissioner

of recreation, hopes will be a step
towards making health protection a di-
mension of recreation in Cleveland, he
has added a nurse to his staff to fill the
newly-created position, the director of
health education. The idea of a quali-
fied, full-time staff member to work
closely with other supervisory personnel
is believed to be unique among estab-
lished municipal recreation programs
in this country; and is Mr. Nagy’s an-
swer to a problem which has long
troubled him: that the health protection
available to children at school and
adults at work is not available to them
at play. The idea had its origin last
summer when the commissioner hired a
nurse to study health problems at the
city’s swimming pools, and a whole new
policy for the pools resulted. He was
surprised and pleased at what even one
nurse could do, saw improvement in an
area in which he had long felt recrea-
tion to be deficient, and ordered similar
studies made of indoor recreation facili-
ties. These stinies, now under way, give
promise of yielding equally impressive
results.

Cleveland News, is now, a free lance
writer specializing in recreation tOpics.

When the city’s outdoor swimming
pools opened last summer, there were
the familiar complaints from mothers
that their children had picked up skin
rashes at the pools, or had not been
given adequate first aid treatment after
minor accidents, or had been exposed to
other children carryinglarge, open sores
on their bodies. Much as he would have
liked to, Commissioner Nagy knew that
staffing the pools with trained medical
personnel was a budgetary impossibil-
ity, so he decided to hire a nurse to
study the problem and make recommen-
dations.

Fortunately a nurse with wide experi-
ence in dealing with large groups was
available for the job—Margaret T. Bo-
gart, R.N., with fourteen years nursing
experience in industry, the government
and the army, was seeking summertime
employment while studying for her mas-
ter’s degree. Nurse Bogart says that at
first she couldn’t see the need for a
nurse in recreation, but one summer on
the job has changed her mind.

After personally inspecting the pools
to check on the complaints, she sug-
gested that a proper first step would be
to have pool staff members examine the
bodies of patrons before they entered
the pools and exclude those persons who
looked as though they were carrying in-
fectious skin diseases. Although per-
missible under the city health code, this
had never been attempted before for
lack of competent people to make the
examinations, but Nurse Bogart felt
that she could teach lifeguards and
other pool personnel to recognize sus-
pected cases of ring worm, impetigo,

athlete’s foot, various skin rashes and
poison ivy. After consultation with the
division of health, she added open,
draining sores to her list of grounds for
exclusion when it was decided that the
chlorine strength of the city’s pools,
while enough to kill most germs, is re-
duced by the presence of large numbers
of bathers and of bathers with oil on
their bodies. Tests for chlorine strength
are conducted hourly, after which the
proper chlorine level is restored, but it
was agreed that the interval was too
long for safety. Signs were posted in-
forming patrons that those who did not
qualify for admission under the new
regulations would get their money re-
funded and would be admitted only
when they produced certificates from

.their doctors or from the division of

health (obtainable at no cost) to prove
that the infectious condition had been
remedied.

In addition to teaching recognition
of suspected cases of these various dis-
eases, Nurse Bogart set up surveys at
the pools to determine “accident poten-
tial” as a start toward finding ways to
prevent accidents, and prepared a
course in first aid, to be revised the fol-
lowing year on the basis of the surveys,
which also would establish which types
of injuries occurred most frequently.
She used both formal and informal
teaching methods for her “in-service”
education program. On Mondays, when
the pools were being drained, lifeguards
were required to attend institutes, where
the nurse would lecture and show post-
ers and films depicting those diseases
which would not be grounds for exclu-

To enlist patrons in the new health
program, a division of recreation artist
made posters to be displayed at all the
pools. One of these colorful and highly
original signs told patrons how, “For
Safety’s Sake,” new qualifications for
admission had been established and
urged all to cooperate. Another offered
“Ten Swimming Hints” to remind
swimmers to “Look before you dive”
and to “Stay within your depth”; while
a third told of the “Signs of Prolonged
Swimming” such as “bluish tinge to the

lips” and “uncontrollable shivering.”
The biggest problem during the pro-
gram’s first summer was found to be the
large turnover in pool personnel, which
made it necessary to teach the same ma-
terial several times during the summer.
This condition led Nurse Bogart to rec-
ommend at season’s end that formal
training sessions for key boys and girls,
similar to the institutes for lifeguards,
be undertaken next summer, to make
certain that a wider range of fully quali-
fied people would always be available.
Another problem was found to be gen-
eral indifference to the new health pro-
gram, which led in some cases to our-
sory examinations and failure to report
every pool accident, but it is thought
this attitude will pass once the health
program becomes established as a reg-
ular part of the summer routine. Occa-
sionally a patron would object to being
excluded, but none of these complaints
were carried past Mr. N agy’s office.

That there was a need for the new
health program in the city’s pools is
borne out by the figures below. They
are more impressive when it is remem-
bored that a full month in one of the
hottest summers in recent history had

elapsed before the program was insti-
tuted:

Commissioner Nagy accepts these
figures as proof that swimming in pools
can be made safer and healthier at a
cost which is minimal in comparison to
the importance of the work being done.
In addition, he feels they indicate that
a vast area for research exists. Anxious
to see if the same can be done for rec-
reation indoors, he has authorized
Nurse Bogart’s study expanded to in-

with health education coming in for as
much attention as health protection.

In addition to mounting health post-
ers at all the centers and making avail-
able free pamphlets on various health
topics, Nurse Bogart has been asking
for requests for information relating to
health. A typical response was that of
a member of a golden-age group (per-
sons sixty-five and older) who wanted
to learn about the process of aging, so
he could better understand changes
within himself. No attempt at personal
diagnosis is ever made, of course, but
Nurse Bogart is happy at the chance
which recreation affords for spreading
health information. Whenever a topic
is suggested that she does not feel quali-
fied to handle, she arranges for a doctor
from the division of health to speak to
the group requesting such information.

Mr. Nagy sees the new health pro-

elude six recreation centers, four “boys’

and crafts center.

Spotting infectious diseases on pa-
trons, accident prevention and knowing
how to administer proper first aid are
still the important considerations, but
it is hoped that the program indoors
will eventually become more general,

tivities,” he says, and assures'that so

can be found to make recreation safer
and healthier, health protection will be
a part of recreation in Cleveland.

“Here comes the Craft Mobile!”

Yes, that’s the shout commonly heard on the playgrounds
of St. Cloud, Minnesota. Here is another “mobile” unit to
add to the ever-increasing p0pularity and use of the prin-
ciple: “put it on wheels.”

The city of St. Cloud does not pretend this is possibly the
only Craft Mobile in operation in the United States; but
perhaps many recreation systems are not acquainted with
the workings and advantages of such an innovation. The
idea of the Craft Mobile was originated in the mind of Bill
Miller, craft specialist for the St. Cloud Recreation Depart-
ment. The idea was not born because of its “novelty” as-
pect, but rather because of the recognized need.

St. Cloud, a city of about 30,000 people, has a total of
seven playgrounds in operation in the summer-phase of its
year-round program. Like so many other cities in the U.S..
most of St. Cloud’s playgrounds are not fully equipped with
tools, machines, electrical devices, and so 011, to implement a
complete craft program. The craft specialist who traveled
from playground to playground during the week was using
the well-known method of carrying supplies and equipment
in the trunk of his car. Even at best, this was highly uncle-
sirable as the ensuing disorder meant that materials, equip-
ment, and SUpplieS were often lost, forgotten or misplaced.
Many craft projects could not be undertaken simply because
of lack of certain electrical or heavy equipment.

MR. LOREN M. THORSON, University of Minnesota graduate,
is the superintendent of recreation, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

RECREATION

When Bill Miller suggested the idea of the Craft Mobile
to the superintendent of recreation, it seemed to offer the
immediate solution to our prohlem of eXpanding our craft
program. A hunt was instigated which turned up a house
trailer that had been damaged by a stove explosion. This
seemed ideal since much of the interior needed to be rebuilt
to suit our particular needs. The house trailer was obtained
for a relatively low price because of its damaged condition
and all conversion work was done by Mr. Miller himself.

The Craft Mobile is divided into two sections. One sec-
tion is the so-called workshop where machines and other

 

Machine shop where various electrical appliances are in-
stalled or removed as projects demand. You sce a jig saw
and on the right, partly hiddcn, clectrical sanding mach-
ine. Not shown are two storage cabinets in center section.

movable or electrical devices are installed. The other sec-
tion has a semi-workbench area. Not only may craft pa-
trons work in this section, but built-in racks make supplies
innnediately available for the particular project. Separat-
ing the two sections are two large storage lockers which
house all supplies needed to complete various craft projects.
To accommodate the majority of the craft patrons, long col-
lapsible tables are stored inside the vehicle and can be
quickly set up outside or near the door of it.

Quite naturally we waited with bated breath as the Craft
Mobile was first introduced to our playgrounds. Would it
be accepted; would it result in any increased participation?
The results were amazing and pleasing. In 1952, the first
year, attendance at our craft projects doubled; and, even
more encouraging, was the fact that the attendance held up
right to the end of the program rather than falling off the
latter part of the season. Despite the fact that our craft pro-
gram is larger, we were actually able to save money in craft
supplies, simply because they could be issued from a central
point, and not stored at playgrounds as formerly, which had
resulted in waste, drying out of paints, breakage of bottles,
and so on.

In our second year of operation, interest was still at a
high peak, and going up. Our vehicle is painted in bright
colors and each year we plan to repaint, changing the color
scheme, of course. The following specific results and ad-
vantages are possible with the use of a mobile craft unit:

1. Increased attendance.

2. Increased enthusiasm.

3. Electrical machines may be moved into the Craft Mohile
as the particular project demands.

4-. With an extension cord, the Craft Mobile can set up a

craft program anywhere in the city where an electric outlet
is available.

5. The unit can be utilized by young and old alike. (Even
golden-agers have their fling at it.)

- 6. Materials are given out only as needed, resulting in craft

supply savings.
7. Sight of the Craft Mobile moving from playground to
playground attracts much attention and provides recogni-
tion of our craft program.

While other recreation departments may differ in Opinion
as to who should own the Craft Mobile, our craft specialist
has purchased and rebuilt ours and the city of St. Cloud

leases it by the season. Private ownership seems to assure
a higher state of readiness and upkeep.

We have found, too, that having all tools and supplies for
crafts handled by a competent person has saved us money.
Yes, if you have only a few pieces of craft equipment and
limited craft facilities, try installing your precious pieces

of equipment into a Craft Mobile and make it available to
all playgrounds.

All crafts have a design—the way
they are put together and the decora-
.tions which are applied to them. Cer-
tain elcments govern design, and how
they are comhiued makes a good craft
or an unsatisfactory one.

The first element, called function, re-

l flects the purpose for which the object is
intended. To achieve this, suitablc ma-

terial and mechanical efficiency in the

working parts are necessary. The sec-

pm] is beauty, which evolves from the
?way the material is handled. To secure

NIAY 

Design in Crafts

beauty, designers employ balance,
rhythm, and contrast in materials in ap-
plied design. Applied design is usually
understood to be decoration, which in
turn is governed by the use for which
the craft is intended.

When a leatherworker plans a wallet,
he knows that it will carry cards and
money of certain dimensions. He plans
the size of the wallet accordingly. He
is concerned with safety for the contents
and convenience in the arrangement of
the inside sections. He uses materials

which will wear well. This is the func-
tional side of his craft. He may be sat-
isfied with the texture of the material
and fine workmanship to provide
enough beauty. He may decide to go on
and apply some additional decoration.
Again function enters, for the decora-
tion should suit the material and not
decrease its efficiency.

ZOOK OUT for your head!” is a warning frequently heard
at school and on the playground, because there are
many places around these areas where such warnings are
needed. Written signs warning of dangers often go un-
noticed, but bumps can be prevented, and this is where color
comes in. It can be mobilized to warn the child in such a
way that his body will react automatically.

The first step is to determine what warnings are important,
and the second step is to select the right color to give the
warning.

Principles

The “Du Pont Safety Color Code” is a uniform system of
“color signals” which was deve10ped by safety and color ex-
perts of the Du Pont Company and Faber Birren, color con-
sultant in New York City. First announced in March of 1944,
and promptly approved by the National Safety Council, it
has been widely used by schools and industrial concerns, by
the railways, and by others.

In its development, every effort was made to reduce the
types of warnings needed to a minimum. Consideration was
also given to the associations which pe0ple in all parts of
the world have given to color through the ages. The sched-
ule of warnings to be signalled by color was reduced to six,
and individual colors were chosen because of their practi-
cal aspects and traditional associations.

Yellow was adopted in the Du Pont Safety Color Code to
be used for the bumping, stumbling, falling, or tripping
hazards. This was done because numerous tests have shown
that yellow attracts attention more quickly than any other
color. Another advantage of yellow is that most children
can distinguish it even though they may be color-blind, and
unable to distinguish between red and green. Also, yellow
has a very high visibility under practically all lighting
conditions.

Orange, like yellow, has a high attraction for the eye. It
possesses good visibility, even in shadow. This is in con-
trast to red, which is apt to appear brown if the light is bad.
Therefore, orange is ideal for marking danger areas, and it
was chosen to mark things that might cut, crush, or cause
injuries other than the hazards signalled by yellow.

308 Reprinted through courtesy of E. I. du P.0nt de Nemours & Company.

Green was chosen for marking safety equipment because
of its traditional association with this subject.

Red has long been associated with fire protection. Every
child who has seen a fire company in action links red with
fire, and the authors of the color code therefore chose it
for this one purpose.

Blue was chosen for the marking of electrical controls or
for equipment under repair, or which should not be oper-
ated. Throughout industry and transportation, blue has been

- used for many years to indicate caution.

White or gray or black—colors that are not as striking as
the other five used in the code—are reserved for the lesser
role of indicating traHic lanes, corners, rubbish boxes, and
the like.

It can thus be seen that the recommendations in the Safety
Color Code are simple. They can be used in the school
buildings and on ships, and can easily be adapted for use on
playground equipment such as slides, see-saws, swings,
swing rings, jungle gyms, and trash cans.

Playground Recommendations

Slides and Jungle Gyms: Green is the logical color. It is
IJOpular. It is conducive to happiness, and counteracts the
excessive brightness of sunlight. Furthermore, it is very
restful. The steps leading to the top of the slide should be
painted yellow to increase their visibility. The contrast be-
tween green and yellow will automatically draw the atten-
tion of children and remind them to watch out for the steps.

See-Saws or Teeter-Totters: Green is a pleasing color to
use here. The edges should be painted yellow. That will
tend to make them more easily seen by children who are apt
to be hit by them or to run into them while at play.

Swings and Swing Rings: For the uprights and overhead
hars, green is again the best color. The seats or rings should
be painted yellow. They will thus be more easily noticed by
children who might otherwise be hit by them.

Trash Cans: Gray with a white star. Gray is the most
practical color for waste receptacles. A white star empha-
sizes neatness and cleanliness. By so painting refuse cans,
children are attracted and unconsciously encouraged to do
their share to keep up the neat appearance of a playground.

PLAYGROUND
SAFETY I
IN ATOM CITY

 

pLAYGROUND safety is a two-pronged program of educa-
tion and hazard elimination in Richland, Washington,
me town of men and women who manufacture the atomic
:l, plutonium. Boys and girls in the southeastern Wash-
;ton atom city are taught the safe way to handle radio-
:ive isotopes at Hanford Atomic Products Operation.
The General Electric Company, operating the plant and
a town as prime contractor for the U. S. Atomic Encrgy
mmission, has applied industrial formulas to playground
ograms with these gratifying results: in 1950, at the bc-
wing of the city’s park and playground development pro-
am, there were no accidents reported on existing play-
ound cquipment; in 1951, thc number of accidents rose
arply to fifteen after the major portion of the city’s new
ayground equipment was installed; this was brought down
the low total of three reported accidents in 1952.
In 1943, when Richland was selected as a site for the
arthwest’s atomic city, there was a p0pulation of 250; in
’53, thcre were nearly 25,000 people living in the city.
bout 7,000 of them were school-age children depending
most entirely on the city’s park and playground system
r their summer recreation. In 1952, General Electric’s
:mmer recreation program attracted a total attendance of
1,000 children. Yet there were only three accidents serious
lOngh to report.
Hazard elimination by itself is only half the job done.
be other half, added to complete the safety picture, is thc
:mpanion campaign on safety education.
Recreation leaders are constantly teaching and helping
1ildren to play more safely. It’s a sort of perpetual motion
rogram to develop that sixth sense of self-preservation in

)ungsters.
Rules of conduct in the parks and playgrounds are mainly

safety regulations. Adults as well as children are covered by
regulations posted in all play areas. Adults are also given
the benefit of recreation leadership in informal and formal
group gatherings. While safety is not “preached,” it does
play a part in instruction since the right way to play a game
is always the safest way.

Football, baseball and basketball clinics are conducted
each season, not only to help youngsters have more fun by
learning more about games, but to teach them the safest way
to play them. Players in baseball clinics, for example, are
taught how to fall away from a ball or a slide, how to slide
into a base, cover second base on a double play, and how
to get away from a sliding runner. Similar techniques are
taught in other clinics, usually held at the beginning of the
respective seasons. Such instruction is also given adults in
a special winter recreation program.

Kite Hyers are warned every spring of the dangers of
flying their craft too near power lines and against using
anything metallic, such as wire or Christmas string, to guide
kites.

Bicycles, too, can be a problem if youngsters use them
without discrimination. The city’s patrol force conducts a
bicycle safety school, and the Recreation and Civic Affairs
Unit conducts a bicycle skill contest as part‘ of the summer
recreation program. There are in excess of six thousand
bicycles registered with the patrol. Without this program,
they could become one of the worst hazards in the city.

Turning to drama, music and poetry to tell the playground
safety story, members of the General Electric Recreation
and Civic Affairs Unit have found one of their most effective
means of reaching the children.

“Mr. Wrong Way” and “Mr. Right Way” have become
classic playground characters in Richland. This shows that
children are best reached through something they love. The
characters are two clowns played by Richland’s own “Tony,
the Atomic Clown,” a perennial favorite with atomic city

309

children, and his partner, twenty-year-old Burton Pierard.
Tony Prince is a professional circus clown who now works
for General Electric. He has trained Burton Pierard, who is
now an independent clown in his own right, and together
they tell the safety story.

In skits they act out short poems written by Mrs. M. L.
(Betty) Szulinski, better known in Richland as “The Lady
from Safetyland.” Mrs. Szulinski has written numerous
stories and songs for children and many of them have been
made into recordings for broadcast over local radio stations.
They have also been syndicated for radio programs by the
National Safety Council.

Planning Eliminates Hazards

In layouts for playground equipment, areas for pre-school
and elementary-age children are placed out of the paths of
traffic of older children and adults. They are fenced off in
such a way that others will be discouraged from making
the area a thoroughfare to other apparatus. Courts and
diamonds are also located out of the paths of general traffic;

and special attention has been given to proper placement"

and height of backstops. Placement of specific pieces of
equipment has been planned so that various types of appara-
tus stand in safe relationship to one another. This is done
to prevent dangerous running in front of swings or tumbling
off slides or jungle gyms into the path of giant strides, tee-
ter-tooters or swings.

Neighborhood playlots are located on corner lots in the
city for convenience, but could provide a major traffic haz-
ard. So they are fenced, and access ways are placed at
crosswalks, to prevent children from dashing into the streets
between intersections.

All play areas in the city have street warning signs read-
ing SLOW—PLAYGROUND. Adequate parking lots are located
in easy access to all the city’s parks and playgrounds, elim-
inating the hazard of cars driving on grounds or too close
to play areas. Bicycle racks are also placed in thesc areas
and bicycle riding on the grounds is prohibited. Other
fencing has been installed at the edge of the city’s Riverside
Park to prevent youngsters from wandering too near the
Columbia River, which forms the east boundary of the park.

The problem of keeping grounds green in the desert means
there must be an extensive watering program. To simplify
matters, and to reduce maintenance costs, automatic “pop-
up” type irrigation systems have been installed in most park
areas. These are ground level and have protective rubber
caps over the sprinklers in athletic fields where necessary.
They pep up during the watering, which is usually done at
night after parks are vacated.

Engineers, checking pr0posed playground equipment,
look for safety features in basic design and probable dur-
ability against the onslaught of active atom city youngsters.
It gets a double check from recreation leaders, who are

familiar with the habits of the children who’ll be runni
and playing on such apparatus. .

Somc safety features incorporated iniequipment at RT!
land are: chair type swings for pre-schoolers; swir
equipped with rubber-covered seats to resist slipping a
eliminate sharp edges if a bump does occur; short li
chains on swings are lighter and more Hexible, giving p1
tection for the child who ust might be struck.

Base anchors in baseball and softball fields are not rigit
anchored but are installed on a swivel to “give” when
player slides to base. This bit of resilience reduces dang
of a youngster breaking a limb. Outdoor basketball goals 2
offset from the main supporting poles so that players sho
ing and running will not collide with supports before the r
is broken. Outdoor electrical fuse boxes are locked a
placed high to discourage dangerous tampering.

Check and Double Check

Park maintenance crews and recreation leaders are
the constant lookout for possible hazards. During routi
maintenance work, crews watch for, report and corn
safety hazards. Pruning crews make certain no decay
limbs are left to fall from trees or in the path of a child.

Weekly inspections of grounds and equipment are ma
by General Electric Recreation and Civic Affairs U1
people throughout the year. During the time a playgrou.
program is being conducted, equipment and grounds a
checked every day by members of this group.

Injury report blanks are kept at all play areas where
recreation leader is on duty, and an accurate record
made of all reported accidents. This way, deve10p1ne
of an accident pattern can be checked at the source, alo1
with a check on effect of safety programs.

An emergency first aid kit is available- so playgrou1
leaders can administer minor and emergency treatment
wounds. Injured persons needing medical treatment a
sent directly to the company’s first aid station in connectiu
with Kadlec Hospital. Emergency telephones are locat.
conveniently so that an ambulance may be summoned
minutes . . . or a parent may be called for a child not bad

hurt but who should be taken home.

Cooperative Effort

Efforts of other groups in Richland add greatly to tl
safety consciousness of children on playgrounds. Publici
campaigns sponsored by the Richland Safety Council, pr
grams conducted by the schools who also teach safety
playground programs, and the Richland Junior Chamber

Commerce program to Scotch-lite bicycles all play a maj

role.
Parents are exposed to a thorough and effective indL'

trial safety program which can’t help but overlap into tl
home. It all leads up to the elimination of accidents.

“Soundly conceived and properly administered, the community recrea-

the key to character training and to the general develoPment of morale

and patriotic citizenship.”

t in one of the troubled spots of the
nrld.

“Our new centre and playground in
iwloon is functioning to capacity, and
ry large numbers of children and
ults are using the facilities which are
ailable. All concerned are very de-
hted with the progress made.

“You will recall that during your visit
Hong Kong certain details were put
fore you regarding a large reclama-
in scheme, and I am sure you will
interested to know that the whole
this area has now been reclaimed
(1 filled in, and work is about to pro-

ceed on turfing and surfacing. It will
be some time before the whole area is
laid out in the manner envisaged to
include a swimming pool, bandstand,
gardens, changing rooms, and so on—
but it will only be a matter of a month
or so bcforc recreational activity be-
gins. This should prove a great boon
to the Hong Kong public. In addition
three large stadiums have been con-
structed capable of seating 15,000,

17,000 and 30,000 Spectators each.”

0 In Newport News, Virginia, the
new Dorie Miller Recreation Center is
attended by more than a thousand par-
ticipants daily. The program of activi-
ties provided by an able staff varies
from marble tournaments to adult ath-
letic leagues. The “Reck,” as it is com-
monly called, provides most modern
facilities for arts and crafts, dramatics,
all outdoor and indoor sports, dancing
parties and a snack bar.

It is well located to serve the Negro
population of this city, with an entire
block being covered by its playground,
tennis courts, swimming pool and a
large high school plant and athletic
field adjacent. The local recreation su-
perintendent, Mr. C. C. Nixon, boasts
that these facilities are among the finest

in the U.S.A.

A c00perative staff of nine labors ar-
dently to provide a varied program. An
advisory committee composed of twelve
citizens represents a cross-section of the
city’s population. It provides helpful
suggestions for the betterment of the
program and encourages larger parti-
cipation in, and appreciation of, the
program activities offered. This service
is very much needed in all centers and
is greatly appreciated by the staff.—
GORDON L. STARKS, Director.

private golf courses in the United
States, 1,321 semi-private courses, 765

Of these, 2,977 were nine-hole courses,
and 2,079 were eighteen-hole courses
or larger.

6 A tract of land in southwest Wash-
ington, D. C., consisting of about 427
acres largely covered with dilapidated
slums and outworn commercial struc-
tures, has become the center of some
controversy through the many propos-
als being made for its redevelopment.
Some of the proposed plans give too
little consideration to the basic civic
and cultural requirements which so des-
perately need to be filled, and merely
suggest replacing housing with housing.
According to Robert J. Lewis, however,
reporter on the Washington Evening
Star, Pierre M. Ghent challenges all of
us to think in larger terms, in a bill
now before the 83rd Congress  R.
5397, revised as H. R. 7185). Ghent

suggests a federal center to include,
among other interesting items, a na-
tional theatre, opera house, music cen-
ter, art gallery, and an olympic stadium
-—the latter suitable for international
sports gatherings, with parking space,
above and below ground, for approxi-
mately 30,000 automobiles.

NATIONAL RECREATION ASSOCIATION’S SERVICE TO COLLEGES
AND UNIVERSITIES

The National Recreation Associa-
tion’s direct service to colleges and uni-
versities dates back to the year 1910
(forty-four years ago) when Dr. Clark
Hetherington served as the association’s
representative to visit schools to consult
with faculty members about courses in
play. At one time Dr. Hetherington’s
schedule'was made out a year in ad-
vance. Following Dr. Hetherington,
similar service was carried on by
Eugene T. Lies, another member of the
association’s staff.

Preparatory to this personal field
service was the work of a “Committee
on a Normal Course in Play” appointed
at the National Recreation Congress
held in Chicago in 1907. Three courses
were outlined, after extensive investi-
gation of what was being done through-
out the country, and many related ac-
tivities were introduced. The historical
picture is indeed an interesting one.

Today it has eXpanded to include
many available services which are re-
lated to the professional education for
recreation leadership.

listing of individual schools and their
courses was published.

0 City dwellers in America have the
power to determine whether their own
communities must endure run-down,
blighted neighborhoods or will renew
or rebuild them, according to a new
documentary film recently released by
Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and
the Twentieth Century Fund. The film
is based on a special study made for the
Fund by Miles L. Colean, nationally
known authority on housing and city
planning. The 24-minute, 16mm film
will be distributed by Encyclopaedia
Britannica Films, 202 East 44th Street,
New York 17, New York.

0 'The first Walt Disney feature film to
be released in 16mm for school and
community use. So Dear to M y H eart—
a technicolor production—has proven
to be one of the most popular full-
length entertainment films in Associa-
tion Films’ library. Disney films are
available for rental from Association
Filins’ four regional libraries in Ridge-
field, New Jersey (Broad at Elm,) Chi-
cago (79 East Adams Street), Dallas
(1915 Live Oak Street) and San Fran-
cisco (351 Turk Street).

0 The Sport of 0rienteering*—a 25-
minute, 16mm, sound color film, de-
picts Swedish Sportsmen in a cross-
country orienteering race and also

time of 26 minutes and is available in

Filmstrips

o Filmstrips for storytelling should
prove a boon to playground leaders
everywhere. The strips, used in a stan-

dard film strip projector, are appeal-

ingly colored scenes from children’:
classics, and are used to illustrate th.
story as it is told by the storyteller
Three stories are now ready for distri
bution, available with or without print
ed captions: “The Ant and the Grass
hOpper”; “Monkey See, Monkey Do”
and “The Crab and the Monkey.”
Reaction to these filmstrips was s<
favorable during their eXperimcntal us:
on playgrounds in ten cities that the Na
tional Recreation Association has ar
ranged to handle them as part of the
regular publication service. They may

Records

Capital Records, Inc., has released
more of the “Bozo-approved” album}
for‘children. One which should be of
particular appeal to small-fry play-
grounders is “Bozo’s Merry-Go-Round
Music.” Genial Bozo the Clown helps
the tots on and off the merry-go-round
for their lilting imaginary rides to the
familiar “Our Dire'ctor” march and

“Ciribiribin” waltz played on a rea
band organ. Available on 78 rpm (CA
3173) and 45 rpm (CASF 3173).

Church Use of Audio Visuals, by
Howard E. Tower. Published by Abing
don-Cokesbury, 150 Fifth Avenue, Net
York. Price $2.50.

Although published in 1952, thii
“how and why” book is still worthy o
mention. The author writes out of Ion
experience as a pastor conscious of th
value of audio-visual aids in worshi
and other church activities. This book
tells clearly what kind of equipment I
buy and how to make the best use of it.
A section of the book is devoted to th
tape recorder and the record player.

I TEMPO CONTROL

 

with

The Rhythmaster is the most unique instrument of its kind. With one
easy movement, the teacher, the director, or the coach, can slow down
a phonograph record to as little as 1/3 its normal tempo or speed it up
as much as 300 percent to suit the rhythm requirements of any activity.
This is because the Rhythmaster is the only instrument in which the
speed is continuously variable over the entire range from 25 to 100 rpm.
Moreover, only with the Rhythmaster can the speed be varied without
the need for resetting or stopping. It is designed for all records: 33-1/3,
45, and 78 rpm, up to and including 16 inches in diameter.

The Rhythmaster is a practical and effective public address loudspeaker
system as well. . . for indoors and outdoors. By simply connecting a
micrOphone, large as well as small groups can be addressed and directed,
even while the record is being played. In fact, the Rhythmaster is a
complete, self-contained high fidelity sound system which also serves as
a radio when connected to a tuner.

There isn’t a single activity . . . educational or recreational . . . which
cannot be more effectively conducted with the REK-O-KUT Rhythmaster.
It is portable, and readily lends itself to any location . . . the class room,
the assembly hall, the gymnasium, the athletic field . . . indoors or
outdoors. P

REX-o-KUT is world famous as a maker of professional disc recorders,
turntables, and phonographs. These products are used by broadcast
and recording studios, and among the nation’s leading schools and
recreation centers.

Intercommunication System

Talk-A-Phone Company has an-
nounced a new master selective inter-
communication system.

Two models, the Talk-A-Phone AC-
5406 (illustrated with the C-20 nine-
inch weatherproof re-entrant horn)
master station with five substation ca-
pacity, and AC-5411, master station
with ten substation capacity, provide
ample volume for paging on all posi-
tions in the intercom system. The addi-
tional master selective system, which
operates on AC current only, is de-
signed for covering large areas, eithehr
indoors or out, or where high noise
levels would drown out ordinary inter-
communications facilities. The master
station can talk and listen to any one

substation or to all simultaneously. Only

 

the master station plugs into an elec-
trical outlet. Both systems have an op-
tional feature whereby substations can
be connected privately or non-privately
and still originate calls to the master
station.

The address of the company is 1512
South Pulaski Road, Chicago 23, Illin-
ois.

in use. Heavy tarred netting protects

Playground Ga mes

Several games ideally suited for play-
ground use have made their appearance
on the market. If you haven’t already
seen these three, by all means send to
the companies indicated for descriptive
literature about them. Any one might
prove to be just the “lift” your summer
program needs.

XL Tops——-The old game of “Dia-
bolo” or “Loriot”—with new equip-
ment. It is a challenging game of skill
and coordination for solo or partner
play. The pliable rubber tops, shaped
like two cones joined together at the
tips, is manipulated on a string attached
to two hand-sticks. Write to Hammatt
81 Sons, 11356 Orangewood, Anaheim
5, California.

Sky-Pie——An exciting new game for
one, two or more players. Equipment
consists of a flexible plastic disk, about
twelve inches in diameter, with a hole
in the center, and a wire “snagger”
which is used as a foil in catching the
flying boomeranging disk. This Cali-
fornia invcntion gives a new twist to
many types of games involving throw-
ing and catching. Information on this
game also available from Hammatt &
Sons.

Loop Tennis——This game, while not
new, is growing in popularity among
all age groups and has proved to be a
highly successful activity on the play-
grounds where it has been used. A
frame containing metal upright loops
and a center pole with a tethered ball,
and paddles, comprise the equipment

needed. D. R. M. Loop Tennis Com-

Folk Party Fun

Dorothy Gladys Spicer. Association
Press, New York 7. Pp. 320. $3.95.

Here is one of the nicest party books
we’ve seen in a long time. The parties
are original, planned in detail, based
upon some holiday or season, and pre-
pared around fourteen different folk
cultures. Wouldn’t it be fun to put on
a Hawaiian Beach Supper or a Ground-
hog Party, a Chinese Moon Festival or
Mother-Son Polka Party? Twenty-five
original programs are all here, plus what
so many party books leave out—where
to get resource material like candles,
flags, records, recipes, and so on.

Another nice thing about this book is
its three major sections—Parties For
'Mixed Groups, Parties For Girls and
Women, and Parties For Boys and Men.
And each party is complete with invita-
tion, decorations, favors, games and re-
freshments! The age range is from pre-
teen through adult. -

Dorothy Gladys Spicer is well known
for her other books—The Book of Festi-
vals, Holiday Parties, Parties F or
Young Americans, and Windows Open
To The World. She is an authority on
folk costumes. In this new book, she
has done a beautiful job in giving us
parties full of real flavor. Highly recom-
mended. ' '

Trends in Swimming Pool Design

Elgin-Refinite, Division of Elgin

Pp. 20. Free.

This pamphlet contains simple, effec-
tive illustrations of the various pool
shapes and brief comments as to the ad-
vantages of each. It also presents, in
summary form, fundamental informa-
tion with reference to a number of as-
pects of pool design and construction,
such as materials, color, lighting, fit-
tings, mechanical and cleaning equip-
ment, which should be of interest and
value to all recreation authorities.

New Dance Books

Back in the April 1949 issue of REC—
REATION we reviewed a set of delightful
books, each on the folk dances of a dif-
ferent country. New ones have been
added: Dances of Austria; Dances of
England and Wales; Dances of Sweden;
Dances of France; Dances of Spain;
Dances of Ireland.

These are all authentic and tradi-
tional. The booklets are attractive, and
the music as well as instructions are in-
cluded. The illustrations are colorful,
and will serve as a costume guide.

Each book is $1.00, and may be or-
dered from Clarke, Irwin and Company,
Limited, 103 St. Clair Avenue West,
Toronto 5, Canada.

They’re well-worth adding to your
dance library.

How-To-Do-It Books

Robert E. Kingery. R. R. Bowker
Company, 62 West 45th Street, New
York 36. Pp. 262. $4.50.

The latest, revised edition of this
selected reference guide to publications
in print and available in the U. S. It
contains 3,500 entries arranged alpha-
betically under 900 headings, with nec-
essary sub-divisions. A directory of
publishers and an index of authors
make it even more useful in locating
books on non-vocational, sparetime, rec-
reational and home-making activities
of men and women. (We are sorry,
however, that it does not include Na-
tional Recreation Association publica-
tions in this field, and wonder why.)

It will save you time looking up titles
in a library. Put it on the bookshelf
next to your dictionary, thesaurus,
atlas and book of quotations.

Short Cut to Etiquette

Edith M. Barber. Sterling Publish-
ing Company, New York 16. Pp. 125.
$2.00.

Miss Barber, winner of the New York
Newspaper Women’s Club Prize for the

best women’s page feature of the year,
has written this book primarily for teen-
agers. From what we hear, teen-agers in
many communities could stand im-
provement in their manners!

Be that as it may, this book is simple,
frank, intelligent and good-natured. It
would make an excellent course of study
for charm clubs, modeling classes, and
so on. We suggest that a copy be added
—casually of course—to the teen-center
library!

Doug Anderson’s cartoon illustra-
tions are delightful.

The Complete Picnic Book

John E. Shallcross. A. S. Barnes and
Company, New York 16. Pp. 123. $3.00.

Akron, Ohio, is the only city we know
that has on its recreation staff a Di-
rector of Picnic Services—and Mr.
Shallcross is IT. He therefore writes
with assurance and authority—and he
writes well!

He has kept his book simple in out-
line, devoting chapters to games for
children, older children, women, cou-
ples, men, older people and special
events. His chapter on planning is
practical and concise; and, in case of
rain, there is a chapter on indoor games.

The last chapter is on food, and dis-
cusses menus suitable for special types
of picnics like clambakes and fishfries.

A cross-index makes the book even
more easy to use; and special praise
should be given to Hamilton Greene,
whose illustrations are clever and amus-
ing. Mr. Shallcross deserves a big hand.
He’s done a fine job.

Under his jacket

Are you proud that he has everything he
needs as he starts the adventure of eaeh

day at sehool? Be prouder still of
something hidden under his trim
jaeket—the stout heart that sends him
off unafraid and eager.

This, too, you have given him beeause
your love has made his small world
seeure. With it, he will build his own
seeurity as each ehallenge comes, in
those days when he must stand alone
without you.

What finer gift can you give those you
love than the gift of security? It is
the great privilege in America,
where we are free to provide it.

And think, too—this is the way
each of us helps build the security

of our country, by simply taking
care of our own. A secure America
is the sum of its secure homes.

The security of your country
begins in your home.

Saving for security is easy! Here’s a sav—
ings system that really works—the Payroll
Savings Plan for investing in United States
Savings Bonds.

This is all you do. Go to your company’s
pay oiliee, choose the amount you want to
save—a couple of dollars a payday, or as
much as you wish. That money will be set
aside for you before you even draw your
pay. And automatically invested in Series
“E” Savings Bonds which are turned over

to you.

The U. S. Government does not pay for this advertisement. It is donated by this publication

If you can save only $3.75 a week on the
Plan, in 9 years and 8 months you will have
$2,137.30.

U. S. Series “E” Savings Bonds earn
interest at an average of 3% per year,
compounded semiannually, when held to
maturity! And they can go on earning
interest for as long as 19 years and 8
months if you wish, giving you back 80%
more than you put in!

For your sake, and your family’s, too,
how about signing up today?
