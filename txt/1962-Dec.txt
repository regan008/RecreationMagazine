Indictment
Sirs:

Having just read Rick Lambakis’
Letter to the Editor in the November
1962 issue, I can only express amaze-
ment! Are human beings “birds of a
feather, flocking together”? Are we
this clannish? Are we really this status
conscious? I believe most people are
against segregation of any kind—and
the private and semi-private family club
is economic and social segregation at its
rankest.

In Wilton, Connecticut, we have a
country club which charges a memher-
ship fee of $3,000 per year. No doubt
there are clubs costing much more than
that for those in the extremely high eco-
nomic categories. Conversely, there must
be clubs which are scaled down in price
to the $10.00 per month mentioned in
the letter for “the upper-middle and
upper-income families.” Why don’t we
carry this down a few steps further
down the scale to perhaps a private club
with a proposed fee of $1.00 per month
for the low low-income families. Don’t
they have any rights?

It would seem to me that this move-
ment—if that is really what it is—
should not be needed. If adequate bud-
gets are provided by the taxpayers to
the public agencies, and if outstanding
creative leadership is chartering the
course of these public agencies. then all,
and probahly more, of the attributes,
save snob appeal, available in the club
are also available publicly. In addition,
you are going to pay taxes anyhow, so
why pay double for the so-ealled pri-
vaey? Speaking of privacy, just how
private are they? Can anyone able to
pay belong? If sheer weight of num-
bers closes memberships. then would
not new clubs spring forth to care for
those “not in the swim”?

One of the outstanding strengths of
the senior citizen or golden-age clubs
has been the fact of no segregation:
former professional people, laborers,
housewives, and all levels of people have
met on a common ground, with a wealth
of experiences, attitudes, etcetera to
share. Is this not, or should this not be,
true of recreation, public or private?
The private family cluhs, it would ap-

pear to me, certainly do not function in
this way, but, rather, by an economic
freeze, lump likes together.

I say that where these private clubs
have flourished to meet these goals pub-
lic recreation is in quieksand, complete-
ly inadequate to meet the needs and de-
sires of the populace. One or both of
two things have happened in these
areas: (1) there has been NO creative
leadership and planning; (2) the mu-
nicipality has been unwilling to put into
the puhlic program as much as it wishes
to benefit from it.

I feel, then, that one of two things is
going to happen. Either public recrea-
tion, as we know it. disappears and the
private clubs take over i there will al-
ways he positions availahle for the
competent professional and adequate
funds by their very nature) or the pub-
lic program casts off this stigma and
does a complete houseeleaning and pro-
gram of public education where needed.
The result of the latter will be a natural
death of private clubs. I sincerely hope
this is the direction we take.

I would like to sum this whole thing
up by saying that the very existence of
a number of such private clubs in any
locality is an indictment against the
public agencies in that area. No greater
Compliment could be given a profes-
sional than. after a sufficient time after
his arrival in an area. to see club mem-
berships slump drastically because these
individuals are receiving whatever it
was they were after in the public pro-
gram. After all, isn’t this our function
———meeting needs and desires?

Recreation Is NOT All Play
Sirs:

In any given profession, it is an abso-
lute necessity to use Clearly defined
language. The word recreation has
probably been given more connotations
than any other word used to identify
any field of work. It is certain that we
could never arrive at a definition of
recreation that would be universally ac-
cepted; but perhaps by reviewing some

RECREATION

 

of the most commonly used definitions
3f recreation, we can establish a con-
:ept that will be thoroughly descriptive.

Perhaps the most widely known de-
scriptive word of recreation is play.
Certainly, we must agree that inclusive
in the field of recreation is a variety of
play activities. Recreation does, and
rightly should, afford within its pro-
grams opportunities for all age groups
to play. However, to say that the word
play can completely define or describe
recreation is a gross misunderstandino.
Though playing could even be consid»
ered one of recreation’s basic phases, it
can never be used as a synonym for it.

One of the important points we al-
ways emphasize during in-service train-
ing programs for new recreation per-
sonnel is the fact that recreation does
include play, but it is never all play!
Needless to say, because so many peo-
ple do not have a truly complete picture
of all that recreation involves, the first
thought of the majority is that workers
in the field have nothing to do but to
play. This is even the attitude of some
applicants seeking employment as work-
ers in recreation.

Since recreation is one of the most
rapidly expanding fields, it goes without
saying that the general public will have
to be educated as to what is meant by
recreation. If the idea persists that it is
all play and nothing more, recreation
can never accomplish its purpose. The
first thing that will have to be estab-
lished in the minds of the people is the
importance of recreation. It must never
be considered as an extra, a dispensable
phase of community life, or as some
consider it, a [rill that can be taken or
left. It is of primary importance that
recreation be valued, in the eyes of the
total population, as a vital and neces-
sary part of community life. It has been
referred to by a devotee of recreation
as the backbone of the community. The
basic idea involved here is that, because
of its many and varied phases, recrea-
tion is one of the components of a good
community around which all else re-
valves and upon which all else must be

built.

Evidence has proven that communi-
ties with a well planned and properly
conducted recreation program rate
highly on the list of successful commu-
nities. In such communities, crime rates
and juvenile delinquency statistics are
low on the list, which is reason enough
for anyone to refer to recreation as the
backbone of the community. With in-
creasing leisure ti1ne on the part of the
American public, recreation, unlike any
other field, is in such a position as to
influence to the good the lives of all of
our citizens. But it must not be adver-
tised as an opportunity to play only, but
also as an opportunity to choose, to cre-

ate, to learn, to associate, to plan, to
think, and even to work.

As recreation presents these oppor-
tunities to its potential participants, it
must always present them as optional,
not compulsory. This encourages the
individual, whether juvenile, adolescent,
or adult to develop and use the privi-
leged power to choose. This idea has
been referred to as providing a cafeteria
of opportunities, where before our eyes,
within our reach, tempting our appe-
tites, are foods for every taste. Though
we should never firmly coerce, strictly
require, or fanatically insist that people
participate, we should at all times en-
deavor to maintain an atmosphere that
would prompt and enable the public to
want to join in the program actively.

If in presenting our recreation pro-
grams to the community, we remind
them that in order to play successfully
and beneficially, the participants must
exercise their right to choose, to think,
to plan, and to work, then recreation
can be properly understood as to its
truly intended purpose. This is as true
with the participants as it is with the
professsional recreation worker. If it is
true that work can be better accom-
plished when some play is included
within it, then it is equally as true that
play can be better accomplished when
some work is included.

I have not attempted to define recrea-
tion here, but rather to assert that the
many misconceptions of what it really
is, does, and represents make it difficult
to understand its purpose. In appealing
to every phase of human makeup—
body, mind, and soul—recreation is a
giant among inter~related professions,
making it possible for our society to
produce healthy, sound, well-coordi-
nated persons.

Area Leadership
Sirs:

I enjoyed reading “The Squeeze
Out,” by Sidney Lutzin. I heartily agree
with him, and could add pages to his
article.

Our city has made such a rapid
growth in the last few years, and the
neighborhood images have changed.
There’s a “crying need” for good lead-
ership in areas such as one I have
served, where family units have moved
to new areas and the neighborhood is
now a bilingual mixture of Mexi-
cans, Negroes, and migratory laborers
(white). There’s no money for paid
recreation, very little money for any-
thing. The children are starved for at-
tention and parental love, and some
recognition.

I don’t like the trend. Area leaders

are a department’s bread and butter and
the only means, outside of the school,
for the children to become good citizens
and form good moral habits.

Don’t Talk to Other Foresters

The Society of
American Forest-
ers held its 62nd
Annual Meeting
October 21-24 in
Atlanta, Georgia.
This was a record
meeting with over
hundred
memhers and wives in attendance from
all fifty states. The theme was “South-
ern Forestry on the March”; however,
this far from eliminated recreation from
the thinking of the assembled foresters.
On the contrary, recreation in its vari-
ous forms as related to the nation’s for-
ests through the multiple-use concept
was very much in evidence.

Dr. Edward C. Crafts, director of the
new federal Bureau of Outdoor Recrea-
tion, delivered an off-the-cuff speech.
Dr. Crafts, not originally scheduled to
address the foresters, asked the man-
agers of forest resources to blend their
thinking with that of the recreation peo-
ple who are more familiar with the
needs of the people to he served . . .

“Don’t talk to other foresters. . . .
Of note in the session on forest rec-
reation were comments by John Mc-
Clellan of American Forest Products
Industries, citing the increasing action
being taken by private industry in pro-
viding valuable forest lands for recrea-
tion pursuits. The attendance in this
section on forest recreation clearly dem-
onstrated to all that great strides are
needed to supply the overwhelming de-
mand for outdoor recreation areas.

Diving into Shuffleboard

To construct a table shuffleboard
game from an old diving board, cut the
ends of the board off, leaving the four-
teen-foot board twelve feet in length.
Use paint remover to clean the surface.

490

A REPORTER’S

NOTEBOOK

Use angle iron (try your local junk-
yard) about sixteen-gauge with a three-
inch width to completely surround the
board, letting it extend the full three
inches to form a gutter around the
board. This is held to the board with
larger angle irons. After being attached,
this is lined with %”-by-4"—hy-l2'6”
white pine board. The end of this board,
which measures twenty-six inches long,
is covered with carpet which acts as a
bumper. Six legs, thirty'inches long,
fastened to the diving board by floor
flanges form the table upon which thc
game rests. After this is completed, a
piece of Masonite is glued to the diving
board to make a good smooth surface.
The Masonite is painted with lacquer in
three colors. Measure ofi eight inches
from each end and paint white. Paint
the next eight inches yellow, and the
third eight inches red. Pucks are made
of electrical conduit reducers, from one-
and-a-half inches to three-quarter inch.
These are ground smooth, making the
bottom slick and eliminating the rings
on the outside. They are painted to
provide identification. To score, the
packs must remain on the table in one
of the three colored areas. A score sys-
tem of three points for white, two points
for yellow, and one for red can he used.
The appropriate numher for scoring can
be painted on the board in each colorcd
area. Each player has four pucks and
the players shoot alternately trying to
knock the opponent off the hoard and
remain themselves on a scoring area.—

and Recreation in Hammond, Indiana,

sociation Newsletter.

IN MEMORIAM

 

«- PAUL VAN BUSKIRK, advance plan-
ning engineer for the Huron-Clinton
Metropolitan Authority in Detroit,
Michigan, died in November at the age
of sixty-nine. He was among the very
first to join the five-county regional park
and parkway agency, serving Living-
ston, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw,
and Wayne counties, shortly after it was
approved hy the vote of the people in
1940. He started as an assistant engi-
neer in March 1942 and had worked on
all the authority’s projects, including
Kensington MetrOpolitan Park near
Brighton, Metropolitan Beach along
Lake St. Clair near Mt. Clemens, and
most recently had pioneered site devel-
Opment of the new Stony Creek Metro-
politan Park located three miles north-
east of Rochester and four miles south-
west of Romeo. Almost a decade ago he
did preliminary studies in Oakland and
Macomb counties so that the authority
could develop a new large regional park,
to be open for limited public use some-
time in 1964.

Throughout his life he was interested
in hiking, camping, and preservation of
the natural beauty of the outdoors for
public use. In selecting parklands he
was always aware of developing “sur-

prise views” where people could see and
enjoy the scenic countryside.

o ROY M. LILES, national director of
the Education Division of the Boy
Scouts of America, died in November
at the age of forty-six of injuries suf-
fered in a three-car crash. Mr. Liles had
held the director’s post in the Scout or-
ganization, with headquarters at New
Brunswick, New Jersey, since October,
1961. He had previously served as
Scout executive in Cincinnati.

Christmas Commercialism
vs Recreation

ISGUST with the commercialism of
Christmas, which debases an old
festival, is widely shared. Christmas
will always have a split personality. His-

torically, the pagan aspects of the sea-
son are more ancient than the Christian

religion. They are in the blood stream
of the human race, which has always
celebrated the winter solstice (Decem-
ber 21) with feasting and merriment.

“Yule” is the word for that aspect of
Christmas. It derives from an old Ger-
man word that meant a “turning wheel”;
that is, the turn of the seasons. At the
dark time of the year, men and women
have always made merry as if they
hoped they could exorcise the dreari-
ness of December.

But many reject the calculated com-
mercialization of Christmas. Once
Thanksgiving is over, the commercial
assault begins with the bogus joy of tele-
vision commercials, the paper snow, the
unctuous acting of singers in hired cos-
tumes, the Santa Claus mercenaries.

The carols are not even being sung by
people. Reiterated all day long from re-
cordings at a screeching pitch, they de-
grade the lovely folk music that retains
the wonder, hope, kindness and sociabil-
ity of people in many lands and cen-
turies.

It is not the pagan aspects of Christ-
mas that are distasteful. It is the cynical
huckstering and the greed.—-—BRO0KS

ATKINSON, The New York Times, De-
cember 8, 1961.

Ir Ir * *

Let local recreation departments be
keenly aware of this preponderance of
commericalism and plan their Christ-
mas programs to counterbalance it:
with carol singing, home parties, family
recreation, folk music, thought for the
less fortunate, emphasis on the spiritual
side of Christmas, service projects, do-
ing things for others, presentations of
the Christmas story—in dramatics,
creches, readings, and so on. Help make
Christmas this year a real Christmas—
filled with old-fashioned warmth, won-
der, and friendliness.

Green Islands Needed

DURING the past hundred years, the
growth of our population, the un-
wise and wasteful use of our lands and

492

Dorothy Donaldson

natural resources, as well as the unnec-
essary destruction of much of our wild-
life, have made imperative a greater
understanding of conservation problems
on the part of our people. More than
ever before, the local community must
take the initiative. In comparison with
national and state eHorts, relatively lit-
tle has been done by our towns and cit-
ies to provide outdoor recreation and
education facilities for their own people.
There are tens of thousands of children
who have literally never seen a green
hillside, and each day the opportunity
for them to do so becomes further re-
moved.

One of the ways in which a commu-
nity can help is to establish a commu-
nity nature center . . . an island of green.
The philosophy here is that man is a
product of nature and a stcward of the
land. Only by being a part of and work-
ing with nature can he hope to realize
his full potential on this planet.

The building of a conscrvation phi-
losophy is perhaps the greatest value of
a nature center. Unless peOple have the
right understanding and appreciation
of nature and conservation, the will to
protect and conserve cannot be created
and the peOple concerned stand to lose
the very thing they hope to preserve. A
nature center, then, besides having edu-
cational, scientific, cultural and recrea-
tional values to the community, also
helps people protect and safcgua rd what

they already have. It shapes attitudes
and actions.

In a practical sense and generally
speaking, a nature center is an institu-
tional device which brings land and
people together on intimate terms . . .
an area of natural land where one may
find the typical flora and fauna of the
locality, and where good conservation
practices may be seen and demonstrated.

To generate the kind of popular sup-
port required for the preservation of
natural resources, we obviously need
outdoor education places where Ameri-
cans, young and old, can be told and
sold the great conservation story. It is
here where community nature centers
or outdoor conservation education areas
present both a challenge and an oppor-
tunity. Time is running out. Available
areas of natural land are rapidly disap-
pearing, and in many communities it is
already very late indeed.

The Nature Centers Division of the
National Audubon Society offers to fur-

nish guidance to communities in the uti-
lization of natural areas of land, and in
the organization of educational and rec-
reational programs designed for out-
door education.—National Audubon

Society, 1130 Fifth Avenue, New York
28, N. Y.

Conservation of Natural
Resources

THE GREAT TIDE for conscrvation
which has been sweeping the coun-
try has not skipped Connecticut. In
drawing up a comprehensive plan of ac-
tion to conserve the dwindling open
spaces in Connecticut, \Villiam H. Why-
te, commissioned by the state to make
a study, called for a state expenditure
of $50,000,000 in state funds. “If the
state scts up mechanics for a compre-
hensive resource effort,” said Mr. Why-
te*, “it puts itself in a position to get
greatly increased federal funds.” How-
ever, he emphasized that “the heart of
this program is the community,” and
called for enabling legislation to allow
municipalities to accept federal funds.

Although Connecticut has been espe-
cially blessed in the number of public-
spirited citizens who havc given their
land for parks, and thc Community
Park and Forest Commission has done
a fine job of encouraging donations, he
emphasized that, “A vigorous public
acquisition program tends to stimulate
rather than stifle this spirit, and ex-
istence of strong statc and local action
programs will causc many more people
to think seriously of making gifts.” The
preserving of opcn space also has fun-
damental economic value for the state,
particularly in assuring abundant water
supply, and in soil and forest conserva-
tion.

* Mr. Whyte gave the banquet address

at the 44th National Recreation Con-
gress in Ph iladciphia on “Building Rec-

reation into the Environment.”

A proposition for an additional $25,-
000,000 for purchase of open space was
passed by the voters of New York State
in the November elections. It won with
an overall 74 percent voting Yes, 26 per-
cent, No. The state was helped by the
National Recreation Association in the
promotion of this bill, as it was two
years ago in the passage of an initial,
pioneering $75,000,000 bond issue for
parks and open space. What has hap-
pened to the 375,000,000? Virtually
all of it has alrcady been invested in
recreation areas for the future or has
been applied for and earmarked for
specific purposes. New York, by its
own initiative, thus builds a priceless
heritage for generations to come.

RECREATION

 

P PEACE CORPS training program for
volunteers going to Indonesia begins in
February. Thirty coaches for physical
education and sports are needed. Vol-
untecrs with degrees in physical educa-
tion and recreation, who can coach,
teach, organize, and administer a corn-
plete sports curriculum can qualify for
this project. They must be proficient in
any of these sports: basketball, swim-
ming, gymnastics, track/field, tennis,
wrestling, boxing, and baseball. They
should also have some experience in
state, regional, national, and/or inter-
national amateur athletics.

Volunteers must also have a sound
knowledge of physiology and all the at-
tendant sciences that are part of a phys-
ical education degree. They must be
American citizens and, if married, both
husband and wife must have needed
skills for this project. Indonesia has
stipulated that sonre of the swimming
instructors should he women.

A volunteer receives $75 a month
payable at the end of his two-year tour
of duty. He also receives allowances to
cover food, clothing, housing, and inci-
dental expenses. For the Indonesia
projects, he will receive a two-to-three-
month training course on the Indone-
sian language, history, customs, tradi-
tions, and refresher courses in his spe-
cialization.

Applications and information can be
obtained by writing to .lules Pagana,

URING the closing days of the 87th Congress a number of bills dealing
with various phases of recreation were passed. A digest of these is
given below. The 87th Congress will also long be remembered for estab-

ant to the National Sporting Goods As-
sociation, in an interview in Sports Il-
lustrated of Octoher 22, 1962. Tents
have shown the highest individual
growth rate with 11 percent, and gym-
nasium equipment is second in rate of
growth, with 9.4 percent. “Bowling will
continue to grow,” Mr. Snyder said,
"but at a slower rate than in the past.
Tennis has prospects of resurgence on
a broad front. Oddly enough, I think
that within the next decade this country
is going to see a tremendous increase in
bicycle riding. . . . Curling? I sure
never heard of it ten years ago, but I

RISE AND BUILD!

So many worlds, so much to do,

So little done, such things to be.

RECREATORS, in choosing the field of recreation as their

profession, have obligated themselves to strive con-

tinually. objectively and positively, to steer other
people to a richer, happier way of life. They have assumed
the responsibility of influencing and aiding people in ob-
taining maximum enjoyment through the wise use of leisure-
time hours. To do this effectively takes skill, democratic
leadership, understanding, and real interest in the welfare
of their fellowman.

Before the philosophy of a profession can be exerted to
influence the minds and actions of others, the members of
that profession must consistently reflect its underlying prin-
ciples in their own personal attitudes. It is important that
we in the recreation profession are so firmly indoctrinated
with the true value and appreciation of re-creating our lives
that we automatically reflect a wonderful revitalization of
spirit. mind. and body through our enthusiastic zest for
living!

Since time began man has striven for personal recogni-
tion through achievement. This personal drive of individuals
has been responsible for contributions to the world, whether
for good or bad. An architect, sculptor, composer, or sci-
entist leaves tangible results for all to see and judge . . .
which are praised or rejected by posterity. This personal
drive within a recreator is satisfied with the knowledge that
in a small way he has contributed to his world by assisting
in the sound huilding of human beings and to the happy
soul of man. These contributions are intangihles but are
the most priceless of all things 011 this earth. Is there a
greater challenge?

MANY CENTURIES AGO a young slave by the name of Nehe-
miah heard of the plight of his native town Jerusalem.
He sat down and wept. One day his master, the king, said,
“Nehemiah. why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not

ment.

sick?” The young man told the king he grieved because
he had received news his home town was in ruins. Since
the king listened to his troubles with a sympathetic and
understanding ear, Nehemiah had the courage to ask for
permission to go to Jerusalem and see what he could do.
The king not only gave him permission to go but offered as-
sistance by writing letters of recommendation to dignitaries
along the route to be traveled. He also gave Nehemiah many
supplies that would be useful upon his arrival at the end of
the long journey.

Nehemiah was shocked at seeing thc walls of Jerusalem
crumbling and the gates to the city ruined by fire. The
townspeople were in a state of depression and bewilderment.
The entire p0pulation of the once busy town seemed to he
merely sitting around hemoaning the sad state of things but
doing nothing to remedy it. With the enthusiasm of the
modern-day rehahilitation leader, Nehemiah shamed, chal-
lenged and then inspired the lethargic citizens to say of
their own accord. “Let us rise and build!”

TODAY we are told that horedom is the fifth greatest men-
ace to our nation. We in the recreation profession know
that boredom can be a fatal malady. We know, too, lhat
it is curable regardless of the age of its victim. We know
the importance of exposing the young to the many facets
of self-satisfying recreation experiences which become a sus-
taining part of the personality of a person throughout a life-
time. We know that, regardless of a person’s age and lack
of such experience in his past, there is still a great oppor-
tunity for him to open doors to exciting adventure and ex-
plorations—each a potent dose of remedial medicine against
the dread disease of boredom.

So let us project our leadership into the thinking of men
until they will recognize the need to fight this insidious
menace by channeling their leisure hours to the never-dry
oasis of a happier existence through the wise usage of these
hours and, as in the days of Nehemiah, they will accept the

challenge of “Rise and Build!” #

THE SLCCESS of a master park plan depends on com-

munity support. Eugene, Oregon, with a new twenty-

five-year master plan, unexpectedly lost a ten-year
levy election in May 1960 by six hundred votes. One year
later an election for the same annual amount over a six-year
period passed by twenty-five hundred votes. What happened
during this year? First, a few key people sat down and listed
certain problems believed significant in defeating the levy.
These included such questions as:

o How well were we meeting recreation needs? Were the
parks merely providing baby-sitting services?

0 Should we be concentrating on large parks instcad of on
a balanced program of neighborhood, community, and re-
gional parks?

0 How much should be spent on acquisition of new park-
land, relative to development of existing parkland?

0 Where should the Pearl Street extension be routed. rela-
tive to Amazon Park?

0 Was $150,000 a year too much to have asked for? Could
we effect economies through more cooperative effort?

A committee, called the Park Study Group, was set up to
try to find the answer to these questions. It was a spccial
ad hoe committee of thc Eugene Planning Commission, or-
ganized and directed by the chairman of the commission’s
committee on parks and recreation, acting in cooperation
with the chairman of the Eugene Recreation Commission
and the director of the Burcau of Parks and Recreation.

PSC members were carefully chosen to provide a rcpre-
sentation that would give the group the maximum oppor-
tunity to solve ccrtain problems. Thus, all agencies of gov-
ernment were represented, as well as various civic organ-

ieations and service clubs. In addition, there were many
individuals with an interest in recreation problems, but with
no special affiliations. The combination of administrators
and a large lay membership on this committee of sixty kept
us close to administrative realities but out of administrative
ruts. The leadership came from the lay membership, a point
of prime importance. Because we were an interagency
group, we were freer to make recommendations to all the
agencies than if we have represented only one agency of
government——-another point of importance.

The Park Study Group proved successful largely because
we worked on real problems, and because we worked to have
our recommendations adopted as we made them, rather than
presenting them all at the end of the study period. For ex-
ample. one of our most significant contributions was secur-
ing the adoption by Eugene and School District 4 (the Eu-
gene district) of a joint policy agreement which states, in
part:

It shall be the policy of the city and the district to coop-

erate in the acquisition, development, and operation of

integrated school-park sites and the operation of separate

facilities where these already exist, subject to the con—
ditions and regulations of the local budget laws. . . .

The city and the district will locate new park and school
facilities as centrally as possible in the neighborhoods as
defined in the Development Plan of the Eugene-Springfield

Metropolitan Area (1959).

Neither the city or the district will purchase additional
land without conferring with the other agency as to its
needs in the area of the land being acquired. . . .

Wherever possible, development of school and park fa-
cilities on an integrated site shall proceed concurrently,
with full consultation between the city and the district,
and park designer and the architect, before any construc-
tion begins. . . .

The architect of a school or the designer of a park shall
be instructed to maximize the joint use of certain specified
facilities (play, equipment, gymnasiums, swimming pools,
lockerrooms, craft and hobby rooms, restrooms, etcetera)
by locating them carefully so that they may be conven-
iently used by the patrons of park or school personnel. . . .

In the joint use of facilities, the liability of the city and
the district and the responsibility for maintenance and up-
keep shall be carefully spelled out in contracts between
the city and the district. . . .

There shall be a separate contract for each integrated
site development and Operation. . . .

THIS GENERAL POLICY was adopted in December 1960, four
months after PSC’s first meeting and five months be-
fore the successful levy. A word of warning: A general
policy agreement should be kept general. Any attempt to
anticipate every eventuality at the time of its formulation
will only bog down the whole effort. Save the details for
later contracts, one for each joint use.

The illustration shows the proposed development of the
first integrated school-park site to be undertaken under the
policy agreement. Having a high school and a grade school
on the same site complicates the planning; that the grade
school was built before the joint development plan was
ad0pted makes for further complications. Nonetheless it is
easy to see that the joint development will provide many
economies and conveniences for both the school district and
the city.

Such economies and conveniences are readily understood,
and we found the school-park agreement a very good talking
point when we discussed park problems and proposals with
various groups. About forty of these “participation” talks

RECREATION USE

OF FARM

EVELOPMENT of income-produc-
D ing recreation enterprises on the
nation’s farms, ranches, and pri-

vate woodlands promises to help relieve

crop surpluses by taking land out of
agricultural production, according to
Dr. Edward C. Crafts, director of the
Department of the Interior’s new Bu-
reau of Outdoor Recreation. Speaking
in Washington at a recent annual con-
vention of the Soil Conservation Society
of America, Dr. Crafts said, “I firmly
believe that the Department of Agricul-
ture has as great an opportunity and
responsihility in outdoor recreation as
any other department. USDA estimates
show that by 1980, 5,000,000 acres now
producing crops could be shifted profit-
ably to farm recreation enterprises.” He
noted that another 18,000,000 acres of
other farmlands could be used primarily
for recreation or wildlife.

Vacation farms, picnicking and sports
centers, fishing waters, camping and na-
ture recreation areas, and hunting areas
are typical farm recreation enterprises
now being operated for profit.

“Installing recreation down on the
farm is a mammoth enterprise, but the
needs are great and worth the effort,”
Dr. Crafts pointed out. “The National
Forest System, which is administered
by the Forest Service in the Department
of Agriculture, already receives over
100,000,000 recreation visits a year on
its 180,000,000 acres and the pressure
is increasing rapidly. Management of
National Forests for recreation is an
equal partner with management for tim-
ber or other purposes.”

The Department of Agriculture has
sought and obtained new legislative au-
thority to increase the help it can give
farmers in outdoor recreation. The
87th Congress heeded the department’s
requests to amend the Bankhead-J ones
Farm Tenant Act to allow loans to farm-
ers for recreation enterprises and to

provide for development of public rec-
reation and wildlife and production. It
also amended the Soil Conservation and
Domestic Allotment Act to authorize
long-term cost-sharing with farmers in-
stalling measures to conserve and de-
velop wildlife and recreation resources
and amended and modified the Water-
shed Protection and Flood Prevention
Act to provide loans and to help local
organizations develop recreation enter-
prises at selected reservoirs.

’ I IIIE Soil Conservation and Domestic

Allotment Act has been amended to
provide for continued federal adminis-
tration of the agricultural conservation
program and provides authority for the
Secretary of Agriculture to carry out
long-range conservation plans with in-
dividual farmers and ranchers in all
agricultural areas through agreements
for periods not to exceed ten years to
provide for changes in cropping systems
and land use, and for development of
soil, water, forest, wildlife and recrea-
tion resources by means of cost sharing
and other assistance.

The amendments to thc Bankhead-
Jones Farm Tenant Act include changes
to provide for the protection of fish and
wildlife, but prohihit the building of in-
dustrial parks or establishing private
industrial or commercial enterprises.
They provide that the Secretary of Agri-
culture may cooperate with federal,
state, and local public agencies in de-
veloping and carrying out plans for land
conservation and land utilization. This

assistance and loans.

through loans, to carry out land utiliza-
tion plans. This would enable the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to make loans to
appropriate state and local public agen-
cies for the purpose of facilitating the
shift of land resources out of unsuitable
uses or out of unneeded production of

governor or

surplus crops into new and better uses.
It would also provide an opportunity for
rural renewal development by author-
izing the Secretary of Agriculture to
help develop plans for improvements
and to assist in carrying out such plans
by means of loans to state and local puh-
lic agencies. These plans could be de-
veloped for severely disadvantaged ru-
ral areas where much of the land is not
in its best use, resulting in chronic un-
derenlployment and poorly developed
community facilities. Their objective
would be to create conditions that would
make these communities attractive to
private investmcnt and individual en-
terprise.

SEVERAL important changes have been
made in the Watershed Protection
and Flood Prevention Act which now
includes recreation development as a
purpose for cost sharing. This means
funds appropriated to carry out the pur-
poses of the act could be used to cost
share with local organizations in enlarg-
ing a reservoir to make it more suitable
for recreation. It authorizes the secre-
tary to bear costs not to exceed half the
cost of land, easements. and rights-of-
way for reservoirs or other areas to he
available for public recreation and of
providing minimum basic facilities
needed for public health and safety, ac-

cess to, and use of the reservoir or other

RECREATION

 

area. The cost sharing is conditional on
a local organization agreeing to Operate
and maintain the reservoir or other area
for public use. This amendment would
not authorize the federal government
to acquire title to any land. It would be
entirely Optional with local organiza-
tions as to whether they would include
public recreational developments in wa-
tershed projects which they sponsor.
The secretary would be authorized to
participate in recreation development in
any watershed project only to the extent
that the need therefor is demonstrated
in accordance with standards to be es-
tablished by him. Moreover, the num-
ber of public recreation developments
on which the secretary would be au-
thorized to cost share is limited to one
such development in the smaller proj-
ects and no more than three in the larg-
est projects.

The secretary is permitted to advance
funds to local organizations for immedi-
ate acquisition of lands, easements, and
rights-of—way to prevent encroachment
of other developments but such funds
must be repaid with interest prior to
construction, except for any part of such
costs which the secretary is authorized
to bear.

MULTIPLE-USE management of the
nation’s 535,000,000 acres of com-
mercial timberlands is the only way to
meet the growing demands for both
wood products and outdoor recreation,
according to a noted forester at the
same meeting. James C. McClellan, as-
sistant managing director of American
Forest Products Industries, said these
needs can be met only by “intensive ap-
plication of the multiple management
principles” to these timberlands. “The
large industrial landowner realizes that
his responsibility as a steward of one of
our most important renewable natural
resources—~trees—does not end with
growing the maximum amount of raw
material for his mill.”

“He knows that his land must con-
tribute to other needs of the people, too.
He has found that the secondary uses of
the forest are compatible with the grow-
ing of timber. The roads he builds for
entering the forests to bring out the
timber also serve as access to streams,
lakes, prime hunting spots and scenic
areas. The tree-farming techniques he

DECEMBER, 1962

employs automatically encourage most
wildlife p0pulations, guard watersheds
and promote soil conservation. Thus,
he regards his tree farms as a producer
not only of essential products, jobs, and
income, but also of water forage and
wildlife as a supplement to the outdoor
recreational needs of the nation.

“By the turn of the century, the de-
mand for forest products may increase
by 70 to 114 percent to meet require-
ments of 350,000,000 Americans. Forest
industries, which own only thirteen per-
cent of the commercial forest land, al-
ready are making major contributions
to the country’s recreation needs. A re-
cent AFPl survey of 518 timber com-
panies showed 97 percent of their lands
used for fishing, 92 percent used for
hunting. Nearly all of the lands also

were used for various other forms of.

recreation, including picnickinn', berry
picking, camping, boating, horsehack
riding, hiking, skiing and similar ac-
tivities.”

AT THE TIME of the survey, 107 com-
panies were operating 146 public

parks and 157 picnic areas, and about
100 companies already were projecting
additional parks for the future. Since
the survey, recreation use of forest in-
dustry lands has expanded sharply. For-
ester McClelland said use of these lands
for recreation will increase even more

rapidly when more states enact fair lia-
.

bility laws giving landowners a greater
measure of protection from accidents.

Up to now, recreation on forest in-
dustry lands has been provided almost
entirely without charge. However, some
of the companies are beginning to make
charges, at least sufficient to pay ex-
penses of providing facilities, and a few
are getting into the recreation business.
Small tree farmers, too, are beginning
to look into the Opportunities for rec-
reational income from their tree farms.
There have been serious problems, such
as vandalism, forest fires, and inade-
quate liability laws, but some industrial
owners are going ahead with plans to
expand recreation facilities.

“Within the past year I have learned
of companies that are making recreation
surveys and developing recreation plans
for their entire properties,” Mr. Mc-
Clellan said. “One large Northeastern
company is planning to construct luxury
campsites serviced by the latest equip-
ment, including modern bathhouses,
washers, driers, and similar conven-
iences.” He stated that the forest indus-
tries are committed firmly to the multi-
ple-use principle of forest land manage-
ment, but that their primary concern is
growing repeated crops of timber for
harvest. This is tree farming. He con«
cluded, “The forest industries see mul-
tiple use as the only way we can meet
our future needs for both forest prod-

ucts and outdoor recreation.” #

National
Recreation

Congress

0 The recent l\ational Recreation Congress in Philadelphia
chalked up the largest attendance ever. Latest reports show
a total of 2500 registrations.

0 Awareness of a changed world and a more prominent role
for recreation in today’s picture was uppermost in every-
one’s mind and evident in every meeting. As was so well
stated in the stimulating address on “Man—“His Nature as
an Individual” by Dr. Ethel J. Alpenfels of New York Uni-
versity, “Recreation leaders and specialists, in a profession
which has the greatest potential for survival, must stop talk-
ing about the changing world of some future time . . . the
world has already changed. . . . individuals continue to read
article after article about startling inventions of the next
ten or twenty years, while each lives in a world that science
and technology has already remodeled. The problems of
this changed world are the problems of the recreation move-
ment. You must face those problems realistically and begin
now to develop new kinds of programs, new recreation cen-
ters, and more specialized services for a nation that not only
will not accept the idea of a shorter work week but cannot
even make plans for the free time that is already theirs. And

RECREATION

the best way to do this is, is to begin to ask some questions!”
0 The new “Day-in-Depth” approach to Congress program-
ing proved to be a successful dcvice in the sparking of dis-
cussions and some good thinking in succeeding sessions.
The Day-in-Depth theme, “The Recreation Participant—
Present and Potential,” was carried like a banner at the
second general session by the three principal speakers, Dr.
Alpenfels (see above); Dr. Luther Culick, vice-president
of the National Recreation Association and well-known
public administrator, writer, and speaker, who spoke on
“The Challenge to Recreation” [see Page 506), and Dr.
Harold D. Meyer, Chairman of the recreation curriculum
and professor of sociology at the University of North Caro-
lina, who did a recapitulation of the day’s program. There
emerged the strong conviction that recreation department
programs of today should be more cencerned with the indi-
vidual—his needs and his interests—as well as with the
serving of large numbers of pe0ple. The Congress Program
Committee, under the able leadership of Edward Thacker,
did a yeoman joh this year. In the planning, it took a giant
step away from the how-to-do-it emphasis to stress the “why”
of recreation.

o The Hotel Sheraton was a joy in many ways, with light
and airy rooms, smoothly running self-service elevators,
and other fascinating service devices, such as telephones
from which one could dial other rooms directly, signal lights
that flashed on in one’s room when there was a message at
the front desk, free parking in the hotel garage, and so on.
However, the size of attendance at some of the meetings
exceeded the size of the meeting room. In the session on
“Planning Parks for People,” ninety delegates were unable
to get in and a second session on the subject had to be
scheduled.

0 Today’s interest in the cultural and performing arts as
an integral part of the well-rounded recreation program was
evident throughout the week’s schedule. The first general
session ever devoted to “Recreation and the Performing
Arts” filled the Grand Ballroom with eager spectators who
witnessed demonstrations of these activities at their best.
These were put on by performing groups of the Philadelphia
Department of Recreation. The music produced by the All-

Philadelphia High School String Band and the All-Philadel-
phia Junior High Band would have done credit to an adult

symphony orchestra. The program, extremely well done, in-
cluded the dance, drama, and two numbers from The Three-
Penny Opera sung by Jacqueline Pack of the Society Hill
Playhouse Company. The specialist leaders were “inter-
viewed” by Siebolt Frieswyk, consultant on thc performing
arts for the National Recreation Association.

The plans for the National Cultural Center in Washing-
ton, D.C. were described by Jarold Kieffer, executive sec-
retary-coordinator for the project, and in the discussion
session on “Problems Relating to the Arts in Recreation
Programs” on the following afternoon.

Further musical treats were offered to delegates in the
opening session and as a part of the Congress evening enter-
tainment. These included the lively playing of the prize—
winning Hegeman String Band of the colorful Philadelphia
Mummers Day Parade, in full costume, led by Captain Al
Fink ( see RECREATION, November 1962, page 437), and the
beautiful symphony concert honoring the Congrcss, given
by the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra with Johnny Creen con-
ducting and Robert Merrill, leading baritone of the Metro-
politan Opera, as soloist. Response to Mr. Merrill’s power-
ful voice, and his warm singing of selections both from opera
and Gershwin, was an enthusiastic ovation. The great audi-
torium of Convention Hall teemed with people, and a large
section was roped off for Congress delegates, who needed
only their badges to enter. Philadelphians, as well as dele-
gates, were invited, and tickets were free to everyone. The
mood of the evening was appreciative and gay.

Immediately following intermission, Robert Crawford,
Philadelphia’s commissioner of recreation, William Fred-
erickson, Jr., president of the American Recreation Society,
and James Evans, chairman of the National Recreation As-
sociation Board, appeared on stage. Mr. Evans presented a
Congress plaque to Fredric R. Mann, city representative
and director of commerce for the city of Philadelphia
and a member of the National Recreation Association Board,
for his contributions to the Congress and to local, national,
and international recreation. Mr. Mann, who is also presi-
dent of Robin Hood Dell, preceded Robert Crawford as com-
missioner of recreation for Philadelphia and was instru-
mental in bringing Bob to that city.

0 Senator Joseph S. Clark, US. Senator from Pennsylvania,
pI‘Ophesied an era of luxury as well as leisure “if we have
the wit to bring it about,” in his address at the opening
general session of the Congress on Sunday evening. He
called this vision of leisure and abundance “the real revolu-
tion in the world today,” and stated that the American people
“We must shift our social investments
from things to people. The new American will not live where

are now on trial!

there are no opportunities to satisfy his leisure hours.” He
went on to assert that recreation leaders are among the “chief
architects” who will design the ways in which the new lei-
sure time will be spent.

0 The. All-Congress Reception on Sunday afternoon was
overflowing with a genial crowd, and the receiving line of

503

 

the Congress Policy and Program Committee members and
their wives were delighted but exhausted by the end of a
happily successful affair. This hroke the ice and started
a busy round of special breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, par-
ties, business meetings, conferences, which lasted all week
long. Delegates were relaxed and friendly, applied them-
selves to making new friends, seeing old oncs, comparing

Opinions, and taking advantage of the chance to exchange
information, opinions, news, and know-how.

o The exhibitors of commercial recreation products were
helpful, as usual, and were satisfied with the response to
the display of their wares. The exhibit area bummed with
activity between sessions and at other session-free times.
In a post-Congress evaluation, many of the exhibitors com-
mented on the high caliher and mature conduct of recrea-
tion personnel generally. Although reercation people are
all-out for fun when the time is right, as we all know they
do not go in for horseplay, practical joking, or widespread
back-slapping.

0 Discussion sessions throughout the week were treated to
some excellent papcrs on the topics at hand. Notable among
them were the two speeches by Dr. Joseph B. Wolffe, medical
director of the Valley Forge Medical Center and experienced
cardiologist, on “Changing Concepts of Medical Care,” and
“Relationships of Exercise and Health,” both of which at-
tracted the attention of the national press and were quoted
from coast to coast. ln the first speech he said, “The image
of America as a nation of pill swallowers and pin cushions
could be drastically changed if there were a more universal
recognition and application of recreation as orood therapy
and good preventive medicine.” In the latter speech, he as-
tounded everyone by stating that exercise helps heart pa-
tients and that he “had never known a single death from
heart disease occurring on a stairway, while many persons
have died in bed.” He termed exercise good therapy and
prescribed carefully chosen exercises and recreation for pa-

tients with a variety of diseases including those of thc heart
and blood vessels. (See Dr. W olffe’s article “Recreation,
M cdicine and tlrc Humanities, RECREATION, Dccen1ber1957.)

o The vital role of the Peace Corps in aiding underdevel-
oped countries was discussed at the session on “International
Recreation” by Kenneth J. Coffey, deputy director of the
Professional, chhnical, and Labor Division of the Peace
Corps Office of Public Affairs. U.S. government agencies
are already vying for thc services of Peace Corps memhers
after they complete their two-year service (the first con-
tingent has just completed its first year) since they will havc
special and intensive knowledgc of the areas in which thcy
have worked. Young architects are espccially anxious to
join the Peace Corps as they are able to work on much larger
and important projects than would be their lot in the United
States. Recreation and physical education skills play an im-
portant part in the Peace Corps program, not only in helping
other countries to set up community centers but also as a
bridge of communication will] the local populace. Mr. Cof-
fey quoted a top govcrnment ollicial as saying, “We‘ve pro-
gramed money; we’vc programcd food; we’ve programcd
tools, but this is the FIRST time we’ve programed people.
The irn pact has been tremendous.”

0 Recreation leaders must learn how to he status seekers,
according to Dr. Edward C. Crafts, director of the new fed-
eral Bureau of Outdoor Recreation established last April.
Dr. Crafts told Congress delegates, “Recreation is burgcon-
ing in this country today. It is the resource bandwagon
of the moment. Indeed, it is possible that we may hear so
much of recreation in the next ten years that many persons
may become sick and tired of it. Be that as it may, the pur-
suit of recreation and the supply of recreation to meet con-
sumers’ needs are essential components of the American
scene. Recreation needs status in the American mind, and
it needs it badly. . . . to achieve this status and recognition
for recreation among our citizens, there is little point for

RECREATION

recreationists to talk shop with other recreationists. We need
instead to carry out convictions persuasively and dispassion-
ately to other groups and disciplines. In time, the smile on
their faces will disappear. This is why I hope in thc future
to talk mostly to nonrecreational groups. . . . In the future,
1 hope most public remarks may he addressed to groups and
individuals not oriented primarily toward recreation. By
this 1 mean legislators, administrators, businessmen, and
executives from all walks of life. . . .”

o A handful of trenchant thoughts picked up at various ses-
sions still ring in our minds after all the verbiage is over:

Busy lives of leisure—Dr. Ethel Alpenjels.

Free time-u—the triumph of free 1nen.—Lloyd Sherman,
exhibits supervisor, Franklin Institute and president, Phil-
mont Mobile Radio Club, Philadelphia.

Lethargy can be lethal.—Dr. Howard A. Rush, director,
Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, New York
University Medical Center.

Today society does not pay for strength. It pays for only
two things—the skill in your hands and what you have in
your head.—Dr. Howard A. Rush.

0 Mrs. Fredric R. Mann, wife of the city representative
and director of commerce of Philadelphia, and Mrs. Rohert
Crawford, wife of Philadelphia’s commissioner of recrea-
tion, made gracious co-chairmen and hostesses of the wives’
program. This included coffec hours, tours of the city, mu-
seums, the new Alverthorpe Park, as well as luncheons, teas,
and shopping expeditions. On the more serious side, many
of the wives attended regular Congress sessions and partici-
pated in a Tuesday morning discussion of their own, on “The
Wife’s Role in Family Leisure.”

0 During the presentations made at the NRA luncheon, the
highest honor the U.S. Air Force can give to a civilian not
employed by the Air Force, its Exceptional Services Award,
was bestowed on Helen Dauncey, retired social recreation
specialist of the National Recreation Association. The
award was presented by Colonel Guy N. Blair, chief of
Special Services Branch, Directorate of Military Personnel,
Department of the Air Force. Miss Dauncey, under the aus-

Among other awards made at the luncheon, the Associa—

tion honored Mr. and Mrs. Lessing J. Rosenwald with a
special citation of appreciation for the magnificent gift of
their estate, Alverthorpe Park, to Ahingdon Township, Penn-
sylvania (an article on Alverthorpe Park will appear in a
future issue of RECREATION). The Girl Scout Golden Anni-
\ersary Plaque was given to the Rational Recreation Asso-
ciation for its long service to the recreation movement. Mrs.
Forrest A. Irwin of Jenkintown, Pcnnsylvania, vice-chair-
man of the Girl Scouts lNational Camp Committee. made the
presentation. Samuel Darofi of the Pop Warner League
presented Robert'Crawford, Philadelphia’s commissioner of
recreation and member of the NRA Board, with the league’s
All-American Award for “his outstanding contribution to
the field of recreation.” Mr. Crawford, in turn, presented
the American Recreation Society Past Presidents Award
to George Hjelte who recently retired after thirty-three years
with the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks.
A newly appointed NRA staff member was introduced at the
luncheon: Frank J. Breen, assistant executive director in
charge of development.

Recreation Commission; Charles M. Graves of Graves Asso—
ciates, Atlanta, Georgia; Dr. Allen V. Sapora, University of
Illinois; and Pauline des Granges, assistant park and rec-

‘x-Tze Challenge to Recreation Today

A 44th National Recreation Congress address

emphasizes that recreation should offer its participants

a connterbalancing change from daily activities

Luther Guliek

We ARE ACHIEVING new understand-
ing as to the nature of man and
the function of recreation. There is, for
me, nothing more exciting or important
than the new thinking which has come
to us from anthropologists, sociologists,
psychologists, and social workers, not
only as to the nature of recreation, but
as to the needs of individuals and of societies. Such analyses
bristle with new challenge. They not only “shake us up”
and launch us forward, but they help us to read more un-
derstandingly the prophetic things which were said and
written by the classical leaders of recreation and conserva-
tion, many of whose words we are only now beginning to

 

understand f ullyl

The new understanding of recreation seems to me to
spring from the new awareness that we are always dealing
with the whole man. We are not working principally for
strong muscles, great skills, or smooth teamwork, or to re-
duce juvenile crime, or fill time with pleasant activity and
banish boredom, or save the wonders of nature in vacuo.
We are always concerned with these in relation to man, the
whole man.

This produces two highly important practical results: hrst,
we develop our program as a counterbalance to the changing
environment, physical and social; and second, we test the
value of our activities not solely in terms of mass benefits,
but primarily in terms of the individual. For me the counter-
balance test is most revealing. If men live more and more in
great urban concentrations, this test suggests that recreation
will need to balance this constraint with opportunities for
wide open spaces. If men work more and more in great
organizations, let them play more and more in unregimented
isolation. If men are surrounded more and more by gadgets,
push buttons and pre-digested everything, let them “re-
create” in simple and primitive surroundings. If men live
in concrete, steel, and glass, let them luxuriate on the soil,
surrounded by grass, trees, water, and the denizens of na-
ture. If men are dizzy with jazz, introduce them to the music
of the birds. If they recede from action to bleachers, and
from bleachers to the picture tubes, give them the chance
and the ability to enjoy direct and vital life too. If men live

lic Administration and vice-president of the National Rec-
reation Association.

in noise, let them have quiet; if they hreathe fumes, give
them pure, “uncivilized” air and unfiltered sunshine.

WHATEVER man is forced to endure, or undertake, in his
ever-changing work or way of living, let us in recrea-
tion seek to balance out and enrich, through contrasting
opportunities and programs. Once you start with the whole
man and his fulfillment as your objective, you are on a
broad .and far-reaching highway. You are putting things
together which have been torn apart; you are trying to see
things whole. This is not always easy, because we are always
ripping things apart in order to see their insides and dis-
cover what makes them “tick.” The chimpanzee does this
in his laboratory cage, and the small boy in his playpen.
We rip things apart, and out of their context, and then we
forget that the context is a fundamental part of the thing we
seek to understand.

Specialization in science, in technology, in any field of
human knowledge and operation, seems to force this atom-
izing approach upon us, because nature is so vastly complex
and the individual man so limited. This tendency to spe-
cialize, to subdivide, hits us in recreation too. We are forever
“defining” recreation as that part of life which is torn out
of the real world, out of the doing of the things which are
required, like jobs or going to school. This is another case
of ripping things apart and forgetting the context. Thank
God for the anthropologists and sociologists who are now
restoring us to our senses—all our “senses”—an(l showing
us that human life is not in fact divided into neat packages,
known as “work” and “play” or “economic regimentation”
and “leisure time,” but is, in fact, for each of us, a seamless
web.

MAN 15 A UNIT, and life is a unit, and we are always con-
cerned with all of that man and all of his life. We in
recreation are the counterbalance, the fulfillers. We want
all normal work, and school, and family life, as well as lei-
sure time, to be filled with these balancing elements which
restore to man the physical, the emotional and the spiritual
activities and values of which he may be deprived hy the
compulsions of his daily life.

Most of us in the recreation field are now doing in our
work exactly the thing we want most to do. Our careers
were freely chosen; they were not forced on us; and, in

RESEARCH BRIEFS

Teenage Recreation

I.

TWO SURVEYS on interests and activities of teenagers were
conducted in Cincinnati, Ohio and New Haven, Con-
necticut. The two reports contain recommendations for
appropriate action based upon the results of the question-
naire returns. The Cincinnati study conducted by Paul A.
Dupuy‘in connection with a graduate course at Xavier lini-
versity involved gathering data submitted by 1,501 students
in the ninth ,through twelfth grades. It is entitled Delin-
quents, Normals and Recreation. The New Haven report is
based on returns submitted by forty-five hundred fourth-
through-sixth—grade pupils and six thousand boys and girls
in the seventh-through-twelfth grades. The findings are in-
cluded in Citywide Recreation Survey. Part I.

In Cincinnati, two-thirds of the children reporting have
participated in summer swimming in the city. Nearly two
out of three boys took part in knothole baseball. Over ninety-
five percent of the students attend Sunday school, at least
occasionally, while seventy-two percent attend regularly.
About half of the students have participated in social activi-
ties sponsored by the church. Fewer students in the twelfth
grade commented on available recreation opportunities than
did students in the lower classes. Many students requested
more activities for teens, commented that the programs were
too crowded and asked for deeper swimming pools. (Many
of the Cincinnati playgrounds have very shallow pools.)

The study revealed that the greater proportion of teen-
age recreation was provided in dense population areas by

DECEMBER, 1962

George D. Butler

the recreation commission and athletic clubs. In the suburbs
where distances to recreation activities are greater, the
schools churches and private agencies provide more of the
recreation. Cincinnati teenagers feel that the most signifi-
cant recreation lack is recreation specifically and solely
devoted to the older teens. Among the conclusions of the
study were that in the whole Cincinnati area about forty per-
cent of all students live within five blocks of a playground
and over three-fourths live less than a mile from a play-
ground. In the densely populated central area, about three-
fifths live within five blocks of a playground and about nine-
tenths within a mile of one. In the samc area about forty-fire
percent live within five blocks of a “community center” and
about four-fifths within a mile of one.

Results of the New Haven study showed differences by
neighborhood, age, and sex. According to the study, young
people in the basically sound neighborhoods are more 
stricted in the number of evenings they can go out during;
the week, study and read more, and attend movies less f*e-
quently. Although there was considerable interest in "social
dancing and listening to records” in all neighborhoods, more
boys and girls in renewal neighborhoods checked “school
days” whereas those in other neighborhoods checked “week-
ends” more frequently. A lower percentage .of youth in
basically sound neighborhoods checked “membership in
organized activities, but a much higher percentage on
high-school level checked “school clubs." More girls than

Income and Expenditures

EVENUES and general expenditures of local government
in 1960 are included in Compendium of City Govern-
ment in 1960 available from the U. 5. Printing Office, Wash-
ington,.D. C. for $.45. Data was received from all 675
municipalities with at least 25,000 population in 1960 and
from a stratified random sample of the smaller 17,368
localities. The publication contains valuable information
with reference to recreation income and expenditures. 1n-
cluded under the heading parks and recreation are cultural-
scientific activities, such as museums and art galleries;
organized recreation, including playgrounds and playfields,
swimming pools, and bathing beaches; municipal parks; and
special facilities for recreation, such as auditoriums, stadi-
ums, auto camps, recreation piers, and yacht harbors.

Total 1960 park and recreation expenditure in all popu-
lation groups was $551,000,000, which represented an aver-
age per capita expenditure of 3.75. Of the total amount,
$144,000,000 was spent for capital outlays, $407,000,000 for
other purposes. The highest amount expended per capita for
parks and recreation was $7.62 in the 200,000-499,999 popu-

lation group and the next highest amounts were spent in thc

two groups of larger cities. The average per capita spent in
cities under 25,000 was $2.08.

The total 1960 expenditure exceeded the 1956 amount by
thirty-one percent. The increase from 1959 to 1960 was only
two percent; capital outlays were much lower, but other
expenses increased 7.4 percent during the year. The bulletin
includes figures for individual cities 50,000 and over, cover-
ing their total and per-capita park and recreation expendi-
tures. lt segregates the capital and current expenditures in
forty-three larger cities of 300,000 and over. Of the current
expenditures totaling $185,642,000 in these forty-three
cities, $35,913,000 or 19 percent was secured in revenue
from fees and charges.

Another bulletin entitled Governmental Finances in 1960
records amounts spent by governments at all levels, but no
separate figures are included for amounts spent for parks
and recreation by federal or state governments. The bulletin
is available from the Bureau of the Census, Washington 25,
D. C. for $3.50. Total expenditures for local parks and recrea-
tion, however, were reported as $770,000,000 or 0.6 percent
of all general expenditures by all levels of government. This
figure represents an average per-capita expenditure for local
parks and recreation of $4.28. Of the amount spent, $105,-
000,000 or nineteen percent of the amount spent for non-
capital items was received in operating revenue.

The difference in the total 1960 expenditures reported in
the two documents is explained by the fact that the $55,000,-
000 was spent by city governments only; whereas the
$770,000,000 figure included expenditures by counties, town-
ships, special districts, and school districts.

Challenge to Recreation
Continued from Page 506

 

spite of the headachcs, they give us grcat satisfaction. But
even those who are thus engaged in recreation every day
need a counterbalancing change. a fulfilling complement
to their life. In fact, I sometimes think we need it more than
the rest and we may need quite a different set of opportuni-
ties than do the rest. This is inherent in the counterbalance
test.

This new approach to the whole question of what we mean
by recreation projccts two important implications. It sug-

, gests that the recreation leaders have more to contribute

to personnel directors of big business than suggestions for
factory baseball tcams, as a means of reducing the dropout
rate. Perhaps work experience itself can be made better
balanced, more absorbing, less fatiguing, less mechanical.
Second, it brings us back again to the notion that recreation
demand is individual, relating not to people in the abstract,
but to the individual man, in his particular and unique
characteristics.

Thus, while we must, for administrative reasons, concen-
trate on the many, on leisure time, and on things which we
know from experience will appeal to the crowd. we must
never forget the significance of the structure of nonleisure
time, and the importance in recreation of leaving room for
vast variety, for freedom of choice, for facilities and activi-
ties and inactivities, which our concept calls for. #

Analysis of current trends
based on data from the

Recreation and Park Yearbooks

rapid growth in the nation’s population and the

mounting public demand for more recreation oppor-
tunities. The studies of parks and recreation conducted by
the National Recreation Association shed light on the com-
parative rate at which population and local park acreage
have expanded. A third factor that has affected the situation
has been the encroachments upon park property due to the
current federal-state highway program and the tendency in
many cities to develop parks for non-conforming uses. In
most American cities and counties the population is increas-
ing faster than park acreage.

The following data tables are based upon information
submitted by local and county authorities for use in the
Recreation and Park Yearbooks for 1950, 1955, and 1960
and in the study conducted by the Association for the year
1940. Some of the figures compare the situations in 1950
and in 1960; others show trends over a twenty-year period.
It will be noted from the different number of cities reporting
that identical cities did not submit data each year, although
a considerable number of cities did so. In reading the tables
it should be kept in mind that the widely accepted standard
for municipal park acreage is one acre per hundred of the
population. Since the standard applies only to properties
within the city limits, whereas some of the acreage reported
is in out-of-city parks, the tables indicate a more adequate
provision of park acreage in some cities than is actually the
case.

Two SIGNIFICANT TRENDS in recent years have been the

Table I indicates for each of eight population groups the
number of persons per acre of municipal park in the city
with the lowest, median, and highest ratios in 1950 and in
1960. It also records the percent change in the median
city in each group each year. The fact that each acre of
park in the median city reporting in 1960 must serve eight
percent more people than in 1950 is evidence that park
acreage has not kept pace with population growth. This
is confirmed by a comparison of the lowest, median, and
highest populations per acre of park for the entire group

Recreation Association Research Department.

DECEMBER, 1962

of cities in 1960 and in 1950. In each instance where the
1960 figure is larger, it indicates that population increased
faster than park acreage during the period.

The table further shows that in each population group
the city with the lowest pOpulation per park acre in 1950
had more acreage per person than the comparable city in
1960. In three of the four population groups under one-
hundred thousand the median city had much less park acre-
age per capita in 1960 than in 1950. On the other hand, the
situation was relatively improved in the case of the com-
paratively few cities over a quarter million.

Table II records for both 1950 and 1960 the percentage
of the reporting cities in each of eight population groups
that provided various amounts of park acreage per capita.
It reveals the degree to which in each year the cities either
met or fell short of the accepted standard. No striking
change occurred during the ten-year period, although some
ground was apparently lost. In 1960, twenty-two percent
of the cities met the standard of one acre of park per hundred
people, as compared with twenty-three percent in 1950. A
larger percentage of the entire group had less than one acre
for each five hundred people in 1960 than ten years earlier.
The table again indicates that the large cities maintained

their ratio of park acreage to population to a greater extent
than the smaller municipalities.

TRENDS over a twenty-year period are noted in Table III,

which for 1940, 1950, and 1960 indicates the percentage
of cities in the eight population groups that either met the
one-acre-per-hundred standard or that failed to meet even
half the standard. Here again in each succeeding decade
relatively fewer cities attained the standard. The 50,000-
99,999 group is the only large one that appears to have more
than held its own during the period. None of the five cities
of one million and over met the standard and only one of
them reported half the park acreage called for. A larger
percentage of the cities in 1960 failed to meet half the
standard (or a park acre for each two hundred) than in
1950, although the table does reveal a gain over the com-
parable 1940 figure.

Inasmuch as there is a variation in the number of cities
reporting each year, the data in the preceding tables are
not strictly comparable. However, they afford evidence
that, in spite of the marked increase in the' public demand
for more recreation areas and facilities and the remarkable
progress that many cities have madc in acquiring them
since World War II. municipal and county park acreage for
the country as a whole has scarcely kept pace with popu-
lation growth. The relatively good showing made by the
large cities doubtless reflects the fact that a number of
them had little increase in population or actually lost popu-
lation in recent years, whereas others acquired considerable
park acreage during the period.

The total amount of municipal and county park acreage
—in excess of one 1nillion-—-in 1960 was a third greater than
the total reported for 1955. This increase was due primarily
to the greater number of localities reporting, although thir-
teen percent of the total at the end of 1960 was acquired dur-

THE
COUNTY’S
ROLE IN

RECREATION

Changing concepts

place an increasing emphasis on
facilities and leadership

Joseph Prendergast

HE STORY of county recreation is a story of growth——
in the number of counties providing parks and rec-

reation facilities and services, growth in park acre-
age, and growth in the number of facilities and the scope
of the services provided. A park study report published in
1928 tells us that Essex County, New Jersey, undertook the
pioneering effort of establishing a county park system in
1895. Says this report: “The idea was not of rural origin
but came out of the metropolitan park needs of cities and
was, no doubt, inspired in part by the example of the Boston
Metropolitan Park District established a few years previ-
ously. The plan, while eminently successful in Essex County,
was slow in being adopted elsewhere. Eight years later
(1903) , Hudson County, New Jersey, adjoining Essex
County, adopted the plan. Twelve years (1915) after Hud-
son County, Cook County, Illinois, established a system of
county forest preserves.”

The first county park systems were established primarily
for the purpose of preserving open space and providing
places where city dwellers could enjoy the beauties of nature
in peace and quiet. Certainly the Essex County authorities
never could have guessed, in 1895, that the 1960 Report
of the county park commission would print such a statement
as this: “Every time we get a new blade of grass to grow,
we get two kids waiting to play on it. we don’t chase the
children, nor do we grimly hammer in a ‘Keep Oil" sign.
The Essex County park system is not a matter of blades of
grass or thousands of acres. It is a matter of people; a
matter of equestrians, ice skaters and picnickers; of day
campers, fishermen, and bocce players; of ball players, play-
grounders, and golfers; of old people, young pe0ple, and
in-between people.”

MR. PRENDERGAST is executive director of the National Rec-
reation Association. He presented this material at the County
Home Rule Congress of the National Association of County

Opticials in New York City, July 1962.

Such an attitude would have been incomprehensible sixty-
seven years ago. Today, all progressive park authorities
accept the concept that parks are for active recreation as
well as for rest and the enjoyment of beauty; there is general
agreement that the two uses are by no means incompatible.
Even quite small parks, if they are properly planned, well
managed and maintained, can and should provide for both.

A measurement of the extent to which county agencies
are providing facilities and leadership for active recreation.
as well as the traditional park services, can be found in the
National Recreation Association’s 1961 Recreation and Park
Yearbook, a nation-wide inventory of local, county, state
and federal recreation and park services. Published every
five years, it contains information 011 municipal and county
park acreage, facilities, paid workers, expenditures, and
many other useful statistics. (The 1961 Yearbook sells for
35.50. It’s a bargain!)

A comparison of a few figures from the 1961 Yearbook
covering the year 1960, with similar data for 1950, gives
some idea of the extent to which county authorities have
expanded their recreation and park services in the past ten
years. In 1950, the county agencies reporting in the Year-
book controlled 933 parks totalling over 213,000 acres; in
1960, county agencies reported a total of 2,610 parks com-
prising nearly 431,000 acres. This was an increase of 180
percent in the number of parks and 102 percent in acreage
over the ten-year period. In 1950, these agencies employed

some three thousand executives and recreation leaders; this
figure does not include maintenance and other nonsleader-
ship personnel. By 1960, the number had grown to more
than 7,400, an increase of 143 percent. Over the same pe-
riod, the amount spent for current operations went from over
$18,000,000 to nearly $57,000,000, up 213 percent. Capital
cxpenditures by 214 counties for the 1955-1960 period to-
taled over $127,000,000 with a capital outlay of over $38,-
000,000 reported by 178 counties for the year 1960. Sev-
enty-eight percent of the total funds spent by counties in
1960 for capital and operating purposes came from taxes
and other public funds; sixty~five percent of the total came
from general appropriations; eighteen percent from general
fund levies; twelve percent from bond funds; and five per-
cent from other funds. Almost $38,000,000 in bond issues
were voted in twenty-eight counties in 1950-1960.

ONE OF THE iMPORTAN-T tasks of the professional recrea-
tion executive is to recruit volunteers for teaching,
coaching, and other forms of activity leadership. The total
recreation job is so tremendous that no government agency
can possibly underwrite it, so the number of volunteer lead-
ers secured is a measure of the success of a recreation pro-
gram. In 1950, nearly five thousand unpaid leaders gave
time to recreation service under the direction of county
authorities. In 1960, nearly thirty-five thousand such leaders
were reported—a tremendous increase of 611 percent. None

of these people devoted any of their time to horticulture or
other traditional park services. They coachedteams, they
demonstrated arts and crafts, directed plays, told stories,
explained their hohbies so enthusiastically that other people
wanted to try these hobbies, too. In all the ways for which
they were fitted by their various skills, they helped to provide
recreation for others. Perhaps more than any other figure,
this great increase in volunteer service indicates the growing
extent to which county authorities are making themselves
responsible for the provision of a well-rounded recreation
program for all age groups. It shows, too, that the general
public has accepted the county in this role.

N0 SINGLE PATTERN for the administration of county park
and recreation service appears to he evolving. In some
cases, new agencies are established; in others. these duties
are assigned to existing departments. Some counties com-
bine the park and recreation function; in others they are
administered by different agencies. Cooperative arrange
ments with other agencies, such as the school authorities,
sometimes have been found practicable.

In 1960. 45 counties had agencies administering recrea-
tion as a single function; 81 had authorities administering
departments of parks, parks and public pr0perties, etcetera;
38 had agencies administering both recreation and park
services, such as park and recreation or recreation and park

513

«‘ ,‘r "nts; and 126 had other agencies administering

m park services, such as school boards or de-

v. .~ county commissions or boards of supervisors,

. a. . n ' highway departments, conservation or forest agen-
ms and public works departments.

The I carbook reports show that while many of the largest
counties in the country do not employ paid recreation lead-
ers. such leaders do serve in some of the smallest. In 1960,
for example. paid leaders served in Mariposa County, Cali-
fornia, which has a population of five thousand; in Pershing
County, Nevada, the home of 3100 individuals; in Cameron
County, Pennsylvania, with a population of 7500; and in
Crane County, Texas, population 4600. Both of the latter
counties employed paid leaders on a full-time, year-round
basis. In 1960, eighty-two counties reported f ull-time, year-
round recreation leadership and 129 reported part-time rec-
reation leadership.

Normally, county recreation and park agencies provide
one or more of the following services: they acquire, develop,
and maintain areas and facilities for the use of all or many
of the residents of the county; they organize and promote
recreation services and programs on a county-wide basis;
they provide service in unincorporated areas; and they sup-
plement and coordinate wherever possible the work of the
municipal recreation and park authorities. The precise ways
in which different counties carry out these functions vary
widely.

In Cook County, Illinois, for example, more than forty-
six thousand acres of prOperty are controlled by the Forest
Preserve District, which employed 733 workers and spent
more than $4,000,000 for current operations in 1960. The
Forest Preserve District maintains six golf courses, fifty
baseball diamonds, thirty softball diamonds, and three swim-
ming pools, but does not employ recreation leaders or super-
vise activities.

Lake County. an agricultural area in central Florida, with
a population of less than sixty thousand, exemplifies an cn-
tirely different type of operation. Here the County Board
of Public Instruction operates twelve playgrounds and three
indoor recreation centers under the supervision of fifty-two
recreation leaders. The program utilizes no park property
and all facilities are owned by the schools.

The Recreation and Park Commission of East Baton
Rouge Parish in southern Louisiana provides all recreation
and park service for the capital city of Baton Rouge and thc
surrounding parish (county). The commission employs
about eighty-seven recreation executives and leaders, and
more than eighty non-leadership workers. It operates twenty-
nine playgrounds and many other facilities, controls nearly
fourteen hundred acres of park property, and spends about
$1,000,000 annually for its operations.

In Berks County, Pennsylvania, for example, the county
recreation board cooperates with more than forty boroughs,
finances its own playgrounds, and hires its own leaders. The
county sponsors a training institute for these leaders and
a county-wide series of playground events. The county staff
issues bulletins, maintains a recreation library, and serves
as a clearinghouse and administrative center. The staff in-
cludes a recreation director and supervisors of arts and

CONCERN for land development looms as a staggering

challenge to all of us. We must be concerned about
whether our rivers continue to become more and more
a sewage system; whether woods and hills continue to
be flattened; whether our cities and major arteries con-
tinue to decay; whether our land areas can be built
upon, in whatever degree necessary, with a greater sen—
sitivity.——WILLIAM J. JOHNSON, Associate Professor
of Landscape Architecture, University of Michigan.

crafts, girls' activities, men’s and boys’ athletics, special ac-
tivities, and folk dancing, storytelling and dramatics.

Incidentally, in 1935, when the original petition for the
appointment of a recreation board and an appropriation
to cover its expenses came before the Berks County Com-
missioners, there was no provision in the county budget
for an appropriation for such a purpose. The commissioners
were about to reject the petition when, in the nick of time,
a bootlegger forfeited his $1,000 bond. This windfall was
promptly allocated to the recreation board. Fortunately, the
commissioners provided a recreation appropriation in their
next budget, and Berks County recreation has rested on a
firm financial foundation for many years.

A very different type of operation is that of the King
County, Washington, Park and Recreation Department.
This agency administers thirty-three playgrounds, eighteen
buildings and centers, an indoor and an outdoor swimming
pool. six bathing bcaches, a golf course, a bridle trail, and
many other facilities. In addition to the usual playground
program, the department cooperates with the Red Cross in
offering two-week concentrated swimming classes each sum-
mer. The level of instruction rangcs from novice to ad-
vanced lifeguard training. More than twelvc thousand in-
dividuals, from three years of age up, attended these classes
in 1960. Plans are being made now to provide swimming
instruction at all the department’s pools and beaches
throughout the summer for the benefit of those who cannot
attend the classes.

A feature of which the King County Dcpartment is espe-
cially proud is its year-round program of adapted rccreation
for mentally retarded and physically handicapped children.
The activities include a half hour of swimming instruction
and an hour of active and quiet games each week, training
in crafts, parties, Special excursions, and an annual five-day
camping trip to a site made available by the Lutheran Church
for a very small fee from the children's parents. Fraternal
and social groups have cooperated in giving parties, which
provide a valuable social experience. The inclusion of nor-
mal participants in the activities is beneficial in helping the
handicapped and normal children to adjust to and accept
each other.

The program for the handicapped and retarded is super-
vised by a recreation specialist and ten part-time workers
assisted by volunteers. In 1958, its first year, eighty-six ex-
ceptional children were enrolled; by 1960 the number had

RECREATION

grown to 380. It is now conducted in four centers, hut the
department hopes, in view of the enthusiastic response, to
extend this program to all its centers.

The park district of Hamilton County, Ohio, does not
operate playgrounds or indoor centers, but its program of
outdoor education, instruction, and entertainment adds a
great deal to the benefit and enjoyment the county’s citizens
derive from their forty-seven acres of park property. Riding
instructors give individual and group lessons, with success-
ful students participating in a horse show at the end of the
season. A park naturalist and his staff lead field trips and
conduct outdoor classes. Saturday “camera walks” and Sun-
day “nature walks” are rotated among the three parks dur-
ing the year. The program also includes outdoor movies,
band concerts, and day and overnight camping.

In 1960, 732 counties reported a total attendance of over
five million people at some fourteen hundred recreation
buildings and indoor centers. Forty-one types of recreation
facilities or special-use areas were reported on ranging from
4,665 picnic areas to sixteen zoos, including 1,642 baseball
diamonds, 1,107 softball diamonds, and 177 swimming
pools. Eighty-eight different county recreation activities
were engaged in by people numbering in the millions. The
activities included games and sports, outdoor activities, wa-
ter sports, winter sports, crafts, fine arts, performing arts,
and special activities of various kinds.

ESSEX COUNTY, New Jersey offers an outstanding example

of a park commission thoroughly committed to the rec-
reation function. To quote from its 1961 Report: “In the
‘old (lays,’ the Essex County Park Commission necessarily
dedicated itself to beautification first and recreation second-
arily. Recreation in the early part of the century was more
a matter of enjoying the horticultural displays. Families
walked enough or bicycled enough in their daily living so
that they didn’t require an agency to make them physically
active. Today, the emphasis is on active recreation. The
heritage of beauty is jealously guarded, but the key to
modern park success is use of facilities.”

In line with this philosophy, the commission operates
playgrounds and day camps, sponsors community dancing,
and provides opportunity, leadership, and instruction for
many types of activities—all this with no neglect of the
park function. Among the commission’s more spectacular
achievements are the succession of spring and summer How-
ers blooming in great heds, so placed that they can be ad-
mired from a passing car, and the magnificent blossoming
of the twenty-two hundred cherry trees in Branch Brook
Park—there are more cherry trees in Branch Brook than
there are in Washington, D.C.

Two new Essex County facilities are worthy of special
mention. These are an indoor and an outdoor ice skating
rink, each with 85-by-200 feet of skating surface. ( See REC-
REATION, October and November 1959). Nearly eleven miles
of wrought iron pipe are embedded in the smooth concrete
surface of the outdoor rink, and the capacity of its refrigera-
tion plant is more than 150 tons. Tests have shown that it
is capable of making and holding ice on days when the
temperature reaches seventy degrees. A center huilding with

DECEMBER, 1962

a luncheonette, lounge, checking and skate-rental facilities
serves rink patrons. The indoor rink provides seats for
twenty-six hundred spectators. It frequently is in operation
for twenty hours a day, with a program of peewee hockey,
high-school hockey, speed skating, dancing, figure skating,
and group instruction for all ages. Attendance at the two
rinks in 1961 was over two hundred thousand, and interest
in ice hockey and figure skating have increased steadily in
the county since they were opened.

ALTHOUGH sports and games are an important part of the
recreation program, they are not—and they certainly
should not be—the whole program. Kern County, Cali-
fornia, recognized this fact when it organized a recreation
and cultural commission in 1944. The commission was con-
solidated with parks in 1952, but the Kern County Parks
and Recreation Department has retained its interest in pro-
moting art, drama, music, and dancing.

Eleven art councils cover all areas and school districts
in Kern County. Under their guidance, nearly every county
public, private, and parochial school takes part in the annual
community art program. Participants in the program also
include college students, adult amateurs, and professional
artists. More than thirty-two hundred paintings recently were
submitted for udgment at the local district art festivals and
nearly three hundred of these won blue ribbons and were
Shown at the county finals. A number of the paintings sub-
mitted were included in a traveling art exhibit and some of
them were shown at the County Museum.

The annual drama festival places high-school and college
students in competition with adults in the regional qualify-
ing performances and again in the finals. There was some
question originally about the fairness of asking the students
to compete against adults, hut since most of the awards each
year have gone to students, it’s obvious they are not over-
matched. This may be because high schools in the county
increasingly are adding drama to their curriculums and are
employing competent instructors to train the students in
drama techniques. The Kern County department also spon-
sors a chamber music festival. a series of children’s con-
certs, and folk dancing for children and adults.

These are ust a few of the recreation services that coun-
ties all over the country are offering their citizens. Any
county can provide some of these things. Some counties
can provide all of them and many more. What any county
should be doing depends entirely upon the local situation,
and only when no one else is doing anything should the
county attempt to do the whole recreation job. Even then,
the county should try, wherever possible, to aid and encour-
age individual communities to initiate their own recreation
services. #

o The basic philosophy underlying the county's role has
been summed up in a letter sent last year by the Las An-
geles Caunty Department af Parks and Recreatian to public
recreatian administratars in the county. This is repraduced
on Page 516. This is sound philasOphy far a county recrea-
tian and parks agency. It is alsa gaad public relatians.
Any caunty department which has this cancept af its re-

sponsibility, and which deals with its canstituent communi-
ties in this spirit, is on the raad to success.——Ed.

UNIN C ORPORA TED RECREA TI 0N

” a I' 'r tin“ HEARS the Los Angeles County Department of
il l ante and Recreation has provided leadership for rec-

n ation programs serving residents of unincorporated
areas throughout the county, in addition to its function of
operating regional parks and recreation facilities. The
count) department has therefore supplemented and comple-
mented the service rendered by local park and recreation
authorities within the county. As a means of clarifying its
functions and services, the county department prepared a
statement in 1961 addressed to “Public Recreation Agency
Administrators,” outlining its regional responsibilities and
emphasizing its cooperative relationship to local recreation
authorities. The statement, which follows, was prepared by
Daniel R. Furman, county recreation superintendent, and
was mailed to all public recreation agencies in the county.
It has received a very favorable response from professional

recreation personnel.

To: Public Recreation Agency Administrators

The similarity of your responsibility to one phase of ours
is well-known: we each minister to the leisure-time needs of
local communities. You do so in your jurisdiction and we
in the unincorporated areas. However, our other main re-
sponsibility may not he as well understood. We take this
opportunity of telling you about it. Federal, state, and
county governments have “regional” responsibilities. The
county of Los Angeles has a regional responsibility in rec-
reation and the following paragraphs relate to it.

Inasmuch as the county has boundaries which overlap
those of all other political jurisdictions, it is obvious that
the taxpayer in each city also pays taxes to support us. Thus,
it is incumbent upon this department to be certain that we
do nothing that competes with or duplicates what any local
recreation agency does for its peOple. In other words, we
should supplement what is ofiered to those people. lt is our
intention that every action we take will be preceded by the
question: Is this supplementation and not duplication or
competition? The county’s regional reSponsibility falls into
three categories:

Regional Facility. Such facilities are ones that are in-
tended to serve in a collective way many dierrcnt cities and
communities. They are ones that no one city normally is
prepared to establish and maintain because the cost and/or
the uniqueness and/or the size and/or the type as well as
intercity use preclude it. Examples are: reservations; na-
ture preservations; mountain and beach areas; camp sites;
large inland water and picnic areas; large and special sports
centers—tennis, etcetera; cultural centers—special theaters
and music halls.

Regional Service. These are those services which help
others through training and other ways to better serve the
general public’s leisure-time needs. We are not directly in-
volved with local programs (except on our own local areas)
but, rather, we strive to improve such programs in one or
more indirect ways. Examples are: training of volunteers

516

and/or paid leaders, consultation and advice, preparation
and distribution of instructional materials.

Regional Programs. Such programs are ones where we
furnish all or part of the planning, equipment, supervision
and leadership. The programs may be conducted 011 or ofIr
our facilities. To be regional at all, a program must involve
people from two or more communities or cities. Co-sponsor-
ship‘and other types of joint action are always preferable to
our “going it alone.”

The best type of regional pr0gram is one that is inter-city
and jointly planned with us by the various local public rec-
reation agencies concerned. It is especially fine when we
each take a share in the operation. For example, the joint
plan could include the setting of rules and regulations for
lead-up activities to he conducted by each city for its own
people and then with our assuming the leadership and super-
vision when the intercity phase was reached.

Another type is one conducted without lead-up or pre-
liminary local activities. It is important that we attempt
to give the local recreation agencies a chance to approve a
program which purports to draw from their area. Hopefully,
such agencies would have jointly agreed that the program
was a need which no one of them could meet. Even then we
welcome cosponsorship, with each city advertising the pro-
gram as its own, perhaps even rcquiring participants to
register at the local recreation agency and then being sent
by that agency to us. Examples are: intercity orchestras,
drama groups, Sunday baseball leagucs, special sports
leagues of various types, choral groups, etcetera. Another
good typc includes unique or unusual programs not normally
donc by any one local agency and which draw from sevcral
communitics. Examples are: [lower shows. art and gcm ex-
hibits. travel lectures, literary clubs, art classes, etcetera.

We want to emphasize that joint planning and/or opera-
tion with local agencies is a paramount aim of ours. We
welcome and solicit suggestions for cosponsorship and other
joint rcsponsibilities. No matter what program or service
we would hope to render the people of your community. we
want your approval first. Conversely,.we urge you to cxpress
disapproval whenever pertinent. Arrangements can be made
for you to get full credit for whatever we do for your rcsi-
dcnts. In many instances, your total program can be greatly
enriched at little or no cost to you. We do the work and you
take thc credit in your community! Ask us for details.

Ollicially effective this July, a new phase of our rcgional
responsibility has to do with our use of ccrtain junior col-
lege facilities. ln each instance, the total program will he
jointly sponsored by the college district and ourselves. The
college furnishes the facility and we the personnel. Such re-
gional programs will be conducted only after review and
approval by our cosponsor—the college district. The pro-
grams must be regional and not local.

A specific budget allocation has been granted this de-
partment and we may not spend it for any purpose other

break the monotony of highly regulated skating areas

SKATE CAPADES, or “picnic games on ice”, as used in Mil-
waukee County, Wisconsin, are designed to break the
monotony of highly regulated skating areas, to give the aver-
age skater a chance to compete, as a test of skating skills, but
mostly just for fun! These games“ have evolved over a pe-
riod of five years and have been presented over forty times.
They have been conducted in snow storms, in below-zero
weather, on slush ice, as well as on perfect skating days. The
rink areas used have been both small and large, always leav-
ing skating room for the general public. They have received
an enthusiastic response in all areas of Milwaukee County.

An equipment hox with all basic material is shuttled from
park to park, and an effort has been made to keep supplies

to a minimum. Eight parking cones to mark the course, four
old tires, one dozen brooms, twelve-foot sections of rope, old
shuffleboard discs, and a hand P.A. system is the basic equip-
n1ent.

A minimum of four people is necessary to run this event
efficiently, as events must move quickly with no long interval
between. All personnel must be fully aware of their duties
and must take their cues from the director as this is an ac-
tivity that is “played by ear” according to the age categories,
the enthusiasm, and, last but not least, the weather condi-
tions.

The girls like the relay events the most and will participate
in these when they won’t get into the individual events.

Prizes, while not necessary, are simple but effective—
trophies (plastic) or ribbons for first place, and candy for
second and third place prizes and relay winners.

The time element for about 150 participants is dependent

on the number of heats to be run in individuals events, but

Getting Community Support

were conducted before we made our levy recommendation.
At these talks we first explained our land and facility situ-
ation in terms of national standards, then compared our
past parkland-pOpulation ratio with the present ratio and
considered future population growth ( see also Page 509).
We made it clear that the park administration knows what
needs to be done in the next twenty-five years, knows how to
set up an adequate park and recreation program. However,
we said, we also recognize the fact that there have to be
priorities for hlling these various needs, and we want you
park-users to help us determine these priorities.

One point we kept firmly in mind throughout—the park
administrators should not be trying to sell the levy. Our
talks were given by Rotary members and others. A mem-
ber of the park administration went along purely as a re-
source person to answer administrative questions.

How did you vote on the Park Levy last May!* Yes 420 No 64
How would you vote today on the same levyi* Yes 505 No 31

*These last figures coneerned us; obviously we were not reach-
ing the right people. Sinee the totals did not equal 726 we assumed
that some people would not admit to their “No” votes or that we
were at least reaching some non-voters. We took eomfort in the
inerease in “Yes” votes. The twenty pereent increase shown here
would be more than adequate to earry the levy if it were repeated
at the polls.

 

After the talk and a discussion period, the people were
asked to fill in the questionnaire reproduced here. The re-
sponses were weighed, five points for a first choice, four for
a second. etcetera. The hgures filled in are for the city-wide
results on 726 questionnaires. We also made a breakdown
by elementary school districts, since these are the dehnition
of neighborhoods in our master plan, generally. We used
the results of the questionnaires to determine the emphasis
in our six-year levy program. Then we were able to use them
as the justification for our recommcndations when we later
went out to sell the levy. (These were among the most suc-
cessful of our techniques.) The blueprint provided by the

DECEMBER, 1962

results continues to be a valuable point of reference to the
park administration when it is presented with new and un-
anticipated demands for facilities not included in the six-year
levy program.

In one respect PSC’s levy recommendation deviated from
the questionnaire priorities. We did not think that the
groups we had spoken to adequately reflected the needs of
older people as these were revealed by the subcommittee of
Park Study Group that reviewed our recreation program.
In Oregon, 10.4 percent of the p0pulation is over 65; of
these people, 71 percent have incomes under $1500 a year;
56 percent, under $1000. Clearly, these people need to have
minimum cost recreation programs provided by the city.
From a political viewpoint we would do well to supply these
programs, because this 10.4 percent represents about a hfth
of the voting p0pulation, and they do go out and vote—
usually “No.”

In a study made of a school election in Eugene in May
1960, it was found that over half the votes cast against the
school budget were cast by voters over fifty—five, although
they comprised less than a hfth of the eligible electorate.
No city or state can afford to he complacent about the role
and needs of the older citizen. PSG concluded that our
concept of the neighborhood park needed to be extended
to provide for hoth ends of the age spectrum; it should serve
those who are otherwise dependent upon the middle-age
groups to transport them. (The dependency argument was
also used to counter the claim that Eugene does not need
parks because we are in a great natural wonderland, two

hours from the coast or the mountains. Neither coast nor
mountains 611 the recreation needs of persons of low income
or of such tender or advanced years that they cannot trans-
port themselves there.)

Not all of our older peOple prefer passive kinds of rec-
reation. A fair sprinkling of them appeared at one of our
two public hearings and supported a request for improv-
ing the trail up Eugene’s little mountain, Spencer Butte,
which lies hve miles south of the central business district
and rises sixteen hundred feet above the valley floor. The
t0p of the Butte is city parkland, purchased by individual
and city contributions in 1938 when logging operations
threatened to denude it. It is a cherished part of the local
sccne, visible from most parts of the city. It is also an inter-
esting climb and there is a remarkable age span in the peo-
ple seen on the trail. Some oldcr pe0ple who used to climb
the Butte could still do so, they believe, if a few handrails
were installed and a switchback were substituted for the
steepest grade, which is slippery with fir needles and dust
or mud. As a result of the interest shown at the public hear-
ing, funds were provided in the levy for trail improvement.

The hearings and the participation talks provided us with
valuable publicity, as did PSC’s reports on the questions
we were studying. The chairman of any committee like PSG
should visit the editor of the local paper very early in the
program to acquaint him with what the group is trying to
accomplish and to try to enlist his aid for editorial support
and adequate news coverage.

The participation talks and the hearings also served to
personally involve people in the election, a vital ingrcdient

“To build a park in this neighborhood, vote YES May 11.”
They were gay and cheerful and the source of many com-

in the heart of the central business district provided the op-

portunity to set up a parklike display which attracted many
favorable comments.

and the Homebuilders Association of Eugene. The best way
to get endorsements is to ask for them at the end of a talk,
and then have a news item about it. Attempts to get letters

almost a waste of time. People mean to write them, but just
don’t get around to it.

TV: Half an hour on Joycee Spotlight.
Radio Spots: Just before the election.

THE IMPORTANCE of personal involvement of many people

can hardly be overemphasized. Our participation talks
were given primarily by members of Rotary; our posters
were distributed primarily by the Women’s Architectural
League; our park sign materials were donated by local
merchants. One of tbe techniilues that involved the most
people was the use of the “pyramid plan” in the last stages
of the campaign, when PSC joined forces with the committee
organized to support other city ballot measures.

The pyramid plan worked like this: Eighty leaders each
contacted five captains and gave them literature to be dis-
tributed to five people who would agree to become informed
and then to vote. The day before the election, the leaders
were alerted to remind the captains to call their five voters
at 6PM election day, two hours before the polls closed, and
to ask if (not how) they had voted. This would guarantee
a turnout of 2,480 voters, or, if all the people involved were
couples, 4,960. This would be a sizeable informed vote. The
actual turnout of more than eleven hundred was very high
for a special election——forty-six percent—and the pyramid
plan undoubtedly had something to do with it.

We believe a special election is best for city measures
provided the pyramid plan or some similar technique is used
to get out the vote. A small turnout is bad because studies
show that more “Yes” voters than “N o” voters fail to go to
the polls. At a general election the turnout is large, but the
emphasis on national and state issues results in lack of in-
terest and information concerning local measures. In such
situations people are prone to vote “No” on the illogical
basis that an uninformed “No” vote is somehow more intelli-
gent than an uninformed “Yes” vote.

So our advice would be: Get a good committee before
you set the levy; let it work on real problems; get as broad
community participation as possible in formulating policies.
Then, use every means at your command to inform the public
and get them out at a special election. #

than for the college programs. Since regional programs
sUpplemcnt local ones, it is readily seen that the allocation
is placed in trust with us but literally belongs, collectively,
to the local agencies in the college district. The fund will
be ample enough for this first year. We expect succeeding
years to see a great increase as local agencies demonstrate
the need. Our district representatives will shortly be con-
tacting the agencies concerned in this year’s program.

I would be more than pleased to discuss our regional plans
in person with you to determine how we might be of greater
service to you and your community. #

TOYS, SPORTS, and VEHICLES

Baseball and croquet appeased a pleasure-hungry country

Marshall and Inez McClintock

THE CIVIL \VAR helped make base-

ball the number one sport of the

nation. Among Union prisoners
in Confederate camps, baseball was the
favorite pasttime during the hours al-
lowed for outdoor activity. After the
war, teams toured the country, playing
before larger and larger audiences——
and professional baseball was born.
What had once been a game for boys
became a game for men as well. Bats
were turned out by the thousands, by
Hawes of Towanda and many other
woodturning plants located near good
hardwood reserves. \Vell-known sport-
ing-goods houses were established : Peck
& Snyder of 1\',ew York in 1865, A. J.
Beach 8' Co. of Philadelphia in 1867,
Wright 3; Ditson of Boston in 1871, and
A. G. Spalding 8: Brother of Chicago in
1876. Wolf Fletcher and Philip Gold-

smith of Covington, Kentucky, who

America by Marshall and Inez M cClin-

manufactured dolls and stuffed animals,
looked about for something to keep
their workers busy after the Christmas
rush—the perpetual toy-business prob-
lem—and hit upon baseballs. These sold
so well that during the 1890’s baseballs

and other sporting goods became the

 

major products of Philip Coldsmith’s
Sons.

Immediately after the war another
outdoor pastime seized the fancy of a
nation hungry for pleasure after four
ugly years. Croquet was a quieter and
more genteel game than baseball, and it
could be played on almost any lawn——
nearly everyone had a lawn in those

days. One reason for its pOpularity was
its mildness, for women could engage
in this sport without ruffling hair or
clothing. In an era which saw the first
signs of the emancipation of women——
it was the time of Amelia Bloomer, Lucy
Stone, and the first women’s colleges—
the weaker sex snatched at the oppor-
tunity to engage in sport with men.

With hundreds of woodturning plants
in the country, it was easy to supply the
unprecedented demand for croquet sets,
as did Charles M. Crandall, Hawes of
Towanda, E. I. Horsman, and many
others. The South Bend Manufacturing
Company, established in Indiana in
1874, was still one of the principal man-
ufacturers of croquet sets eighty years
later.

Wars usually produce scores of minor
revolutions in the habits, thoughts, and
customs of the pe0ple involved, as well
as major alterations in cconomic and
political life. The Civil War brought
ruin to the South and increased pros-
perity to the North. When it started, the

 .v ' industry" that spread to almost
a'l -: ';.- .m-nts of the Northern population.
Printmiive tariffs were passed to encour-
agi- American industry—notably iron
and steel——-and new factories were
erected by the hundreds. The increas-
ing use of coal by factories and fast-
growing railroads caused more mines
to be opened. In 1859 the first oil well
was sunk in Pennsylvania and a new in-
dustry born. which was hustled quickly
through its childhood with the speed
that war imparts to so many human

activities.

PRODUCTION or TOYS dropped during
the Civil War—and all subsequent
wars—as toy factories turned to war
work. Woodturning plants made gun
stocks. tent poles, axle-grease buckets
for army supply wagons; carriage mak-
ers produced the wagons themselves. El-
lis, Britton 81 Eaton of the Novelty
Works in Springfield, Vermont, out-
standing manufacturers of children’s
carriages, doll carriages, wagons, and
other wood toys, added a toy cannon to
their line—a spring gun shooting a mar-
ble about sixty feet—and also produced
Dr. S. A. Skinner’s folding hospital and
camp bed “designed for the use of arm y
officers, and their servants, for tempo-
. and as a litter for
moving the sick and wounded.”

rary hOSpitals . .

Some idea of the relative lull in toy
activity during the war may be gained
by looking at the patent records. Dur-
ing the years of conflict there were only
seventeen patents issued for new toys;
whereas, in the five years following the
war, there were 166. Of the toys pro-
(luced, many were inspired by the war.
The first patent for a toy gun which we
have found was issued in November
1859 to J. Johnson of New York City.
Of the next eighteen patents issued for
toys, through the year 1864, seven were
for toy guns, including one for a “toy
breech-loading firearm” in 1862. Al-
together. there were thirty-four patents
for toy weapons in the years 1859-1869.
After the war, the patent records show a
continually increasing number of “me-

66

chanical toys,” “toy automatons," me-
chanical movements for toys,” and toy
steam engines. The war speeded up the
mechanical aspects of the industrial rev-
olution considerably, and the toy indus-
try, as usual. followed suit; it even an-
ticipated some events of the adult world.

While some firms made few, if any,
toys during the war, others were forced
into making them by the conflict. An
example was Adolph Meinecke of Mil-
waukee, a German who had come to
America, with thousands of his compa-
triots, in 1848, when he was seventeen
years old. Meinecke worked in New
York for a few years, then became a
traveling salesman. When he visited
Milwaukee, he liked it so much that he
decided to settle there, and in 1853, with
the help of a loan from his old New
York employer. he opened a small toy
shop. He bought some toys from East-
ern manufacturers and imported others
from his native Germany. He prospered
so well that within a few years he had
not only a good retail business but a

substantial based

wholesale division
largely on his imports.

Then came the war. increased tariffs,
difficulties of transportation. and othcr
trouhles which, by 1864. reduced Mein-
ecke’s importations to almost nothing.
He decided to start a factory of his own
and began by making willow-ware car-
riages, because willow was readily avail-
able. He bought all the willow he could
from farmers in the surrounding area,
and finally started a farm of his own to
grow more. In 1870. he built a three-
story factory employing more than 150
boys and girls who peeled willow
branches, and almost as many grown-
ups for the other aspects of his opera-
tion. By this time he was making bas-
kets, hobby horses, bahy wagons, cro-
quet sets, shoo-flies, slcds, and children's
furniture.

A Milwaukee newspaper called the
Meineckc factory a “hive of industry,”
and said that “every department of the
business is thoroughly systematized. and
the best machinery used to facilitate the
work of the employee. A hundred and
seventy thousand pounds of willow were
used last year, more this year.” ln 1873,
after Meinecke had built an addition to

his factory, the newspaper commented,

“Only a few years ago nearly all the
wooden toys such as hobby horses,
sleighs, etcetera offered for sale in the
West were of eastern manufacture. . . .
Now, however, the superior articles
manufactured at the establishment of
Adolph Meinecke & Co. in this city are
fast displacing all others and are also
finding their way eastward. . . . Having
established a reputation for their goods,
the firm is now compelled to protect
them from being counterfeited, and will
hereafter attach a silver-plated brand to
every hobby horse sent out of their es-
tablishment, as well as on the better
makes of sleighs.”

One reason for Meinecke"s great suc-
cess was his entrance into a field that
enjoyed a great boom from the middle
of the century on. Vehicles of one kind
or another were favorite toys. E. W.
Bushnell (later Bushnell S; Tull) of Phil-
adelphia advertised in 1852 that they
made “velocipede coaches, gigs, cahs,
barouches, and boys’ wheelbarrows.”
An illustration showed a boy in a three-
wheeler, a form of velocipede often
called a “propeller” in those days. He
sat in a seat with his feet on extensions
of the front-wheel axle by which he
could steer the vehicle. Propulsion
came through two levers hooked up to
thc rear wheels, and the ad stressed how
beneficial to arm and chcst muscles this
device could be.

The Crandalls of New York were ac-
tive in “wheel goods.” both before the
Civil War and after recovering from
their war difficulties, and many firms
were competing with then], making car-
riages, wagons, sleighs, carts, sleds,
hohby horses, propellcrs, and baby
walkers.

Cincinnati was the home of onc of
thc most prominent manufacturers of
hobby horses and other “bulky” toys.
“7. A. Marqua seemed to have been is-
sued the first patent for a hobby horse,
in 1865, although later ads of his com-
pany called it a “leaping horse,” and
pointed out that it could be obtained
with a sidesaddlc for girls for flfty cents
extra. Marqua claimcd later to have in-
vented the first blackboard desk and the
first drop-hack bahy carriage. as well as
important improvements on sleds and
propellers. if:

THREE WHEELERS GIVE

IN MINNEAPOLIS

HE JOB of keeping the municipal

boarded pickup sections, the units can
circle the lakes three times a day, pick-
ing up trash and other debris left by
lake users. Prior to the use of Truck-
sters this was performed by mainte-
nance men on foot, who could make
only one trip around the lake per day.

Low weight and good maneuver-
ability make the three-wheelers
well-suited to the job of main-
taining outdoor recreation areas.
T0p, the Model 780 Cushman
Truckster used in Minneapolis.
Below, a Truckster operates on a
soft lakeside grass area with ease.

DECEMBER, 1962

Additionally, the Trucksters make a
circuit of the lake four times a week to
empty trash barrels. The special side-
boards, added by park personnel, nearly
double the vehicles’ standard capacity
of eleven cubic feet. This, coupled with
pay-load ratings of eight hundred
pounds, equips them to carry large
loads, reducing the time previously
needed for the job.

They frequently assume a number of
other maintenance chores. When equip-
ped with a wire-screen drag, they per-

form leaf mulching. They ha\ e hauled
gravel for road and walkway rcpairs,
and aided in hrush removal. Periodi-
cally, they are used to move seaweed
and moss from the lake edges. Recently,
when new concrete slab benches were
being installed. the Trucksters replaced
wheelbarrows in hauling cement, re-
quiring less time and fewer men.

In normal service, the Trucksters
travel live to eight miles daily. Although
most of their duties involve frequent
starting and stopping, and periods of
sustained idling, they average 25 miles
per gallon on gasoline. Maintenance
costs have been negligible.

Additional plus values, say their
drivers, are the unit’s short turning
distance and low unit weight of around
750 pounds. These features allow ma-
neuvering in confined areas and opera-
tion on soft lakeside grass without dam-
age to turf. #

Crafts Design: An Illustrated Guide,
Spencer Moseley, Pauline Johnson,
and Hazel Koenig. Wadsworth Pub-
lishing Company, Belmont, California.

Pp. 436. $12.65.

A highly stimulating bookl Design,
the theme of the book, is integrated with
every step of learning. Don’t be afraid
of it! It is the craft itself: the materials
and textures you explore. You are de-
signing as you work! You learn in a
well-organized, step-by-step procedure
that includes an appreciation of the art
form, the techniques involved in mak-
ing the object, illustrations, and back-
ground information to enrich your
knowledge.

The crafts presented are bookbind-
i ng, weaving, decorating fabrics, leather,
clay, mosaics, and enameling. Ideas
range from the most simple to the most
advanced. A well-prepared bibliography
is included. The over one thousand pho-
tographs are well chosen, the print easy
to read, the paper is high grade. The
book is an excellent example of the de-
sign principles presented by these in-
Spired authors!-—Shirley Silbert.

Celebrating Christmas Around the
World, Herbert H. Wernecke. West-
minster Press, Witherspoon Building,
Philadelphia 7. Pp. 246. $3.95.

This is the fourth Christmas book by
the author, and, like the others, is a col-
lection from various sources, many of
them church agencies or leaders. It is
arranged alphabetically, beginning with
Africa (Congo, South Africa and South-
ern Rhodesia) and ending with South
America (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
and Ecuador).

The stories, essays, and other mate-
rial in the collection are not dated and,
for that reason, may be rather mislead-
ing if accepted as recent or current cus-
toms. For example, Stuart Cloete’s
Christmas in Matabeland was published
in 1942; Christmas in Armenia was
written in 1939; Delia Coetz’s Letters
from Guatemala was published in 1941.
Several other items go back to articles
or hooks published in the twenties and
thirties. This is correctly credited in
the author’s acknowledgments, but the
book would make a more accurate im-
pression upon the reader if each article
were given its proper date. The history

526

and customs in many lands have
changed drastically in recent years.
Former Christmas customs may be in-
teresting but not necessarily still cur-
rent.

It would be interesting if Mr. Wer-
necke, in his new book, would collect
brand new material, especially from
those lands that have in many ways re-
pudiated the past in their efforts to
emerge into the future. If a book is de-
signed to promote brotherhood, it should
be based upon present-day reality rather

than a romantic, amusing. or touching
past.—-—V.M.

Folding Paper Puppets, Shari Lewis
and Lillian Oppenheimer. .l. B. Lip-
pincott Company, East Washington
Square, Philadelphia 5. Pp. 77. $3.95.

This is an interesting book on paper
playthings. They would bring a lot of
fun and gaiety to a party as they can
be made to move their mouths as if they
were talking. The illustrations are line
drawings, well done. and each step is
very clearly written. After making one
or two of these from the instructions,
one could make others by experimenting
and perhaps adding other pieces of pa-
per, feathers, paper-cup frills, etcetera,
and doing a creative piece of work.

These Origami paper puppets can he
used for Christmas tree decorations,
greeting cards, as well as party favors
or decorations, centerpieces for the
party table, and even masks. The au-
thors have made the rules for folding
the Origami papers and also other pa-
pers very simple. 1 think recreation
leaders would have the time of their
lives with this useful book, and children
and adults would have fun making them.
“Mary B. Cummings.

Amateur Theatrecraft, Percy Corry.
Pitman Publishing Company, 2 West
45th Street, New York 36. Pp. 159.
$3.95.

Here is a concise description of the
art and craft of the theater. Despite his
brevity, Percy Corry has managed to
introduce the reader to the production
of any play, and the simple facts of act-
ing, staging, lighting, costuming and
makeup. This would seem superficial to
the extreme, were it not for the author’s

Preface which clearly states that no sin-
gle book can answer all the questions

involved in so complicated a husiness as
theatre.

Mr. Corry’s ability to express himself
in simple paragraphs makes this a most
practical handbook for the beginner.
Throughout, he urges the reader to ex-
tend his study and to learn through ex-
perimentation on stage. What informa-
tion he does give is sound, however, and
would seem, to this reviewer, of the
greatest help to the adult amateur. Al-
though he is addressing himself to the
inexperienced producer and actor, Mr.
Corry makes the point of high standards
and a serious approach.

I should recommend this book highly
as basically sound, literate and clear. I
should furthermore hope that after hav-
ing digested it thoroughly, the reader
would continue in depth in each of the
areas presented. Excellent photographs
and diagrams clarify and illustrate
many of the chapters.———Nellie M cCaslin,
Director of Dramatic Arts, Mills College
of Education, New York City.

A Sense of Nature, John Hay and
Arline Strong. Doubleday and Com-

pany, 575 Madison Avenue, New York
22. Pp. 128, illustrated. $4.95.

Nature lovers will recognize Mr. Hay
as the author of The Run and Nature’s
Year: The Seasons of Cape Cod, two
outstanding nature hooks. Arline Strong
is one of the outstanding photographers
of children. Together they make a won-
derful team and have produced a beau-
tiful book. To get it, they followed sev-
eral children around all summer taking
photographs in natural settings of spon-
taneous events. They listened to the
children’s questions of “What?” and
“Why?” as they romped in and out of
the water, up and down cliffs and sand
dunes, into swamps, and across mead-
ows. The photographs and the very
short, simple text have the taste of salt
air and the feel of sand and sun.

It is a dillicult book to classify. It is
not strictly a nature book or yet a book
of child photography. It is both; but
most of all it shows graphically what
nature means to children, and how
eagerly they respond to its opportunities
to look, feel, smell, touch, and find out.

ries of wooden lanes and tunnels. A portable golf course,
which can be built outside on a temporary basis or indoors
permanently, comes with Fiberglas fairways and greens im-
pervious to moisture, rot, or termites. Minimum lengths of
the holes are sixteen feet to twenty-eight feet by three inches
in width. Greens are eight feet square. Tee-off areas are
covered with heavy corded rubber matting. Each of the
eighteen holes has a different type of hazard—flower boxes,
barn with silo, weather vane, wishingjwell, church. etcetera.

walls. such as con-
g-type walls, etcctera.
The filter permits water caught bchind this type of wall.
either from rain, runoff, or oversplash, to bc channeled to
those openings which are designed to relieve the back pres-
sure. A cloth of polyvinylidene chloride resin nionofilament
yarns is woven so water passes through freely without per-
mitting fine fill particles of soil or sand to be wasth away.

ORGANIZATION OF A PHYSICAL FITNESS PIIO.
GRAM. Physical Fitness Elements in Reerea- I
tion, published in October by the President’s
Council On Youth Fitness, will be of special
interest—and use—to leaders in public and I
private youth service agencies, since it focuses
attention on physical activities in the recrea-
tion, rather than the school, setting. It stresses
the importance of a community organization
plan, the use of all available resources and
facilities,and the need for family participation.

At least half of the book is given over to
appendices that provide help in setting up a
physical-fitness program: a sample agreement
between a school district and a city recreation
department; a park-school plan; typical pro-
visions of state recreation enabling acts; city
charter provisions; a challenge obstacle
course; sources of official rules and selected
references.

The National Recreation Association has
sent a copy of this booklet as a service to all
of its afhliated agencies. It is available for
3.25 from the Superintendent of Documents.
