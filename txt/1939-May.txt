The program for this year's observance
of Joseph Lee DayI in honoring the mem-
ory of Joseph Lee may fittineg be dedi-
cated "to the children who this summer
will play safely on public playgrounds;
to the youth of the country whose con-
structive use of leisure may become one
of the bulwarks of the American way of
life; and especially to those men and
women who are following Joseph Lee's
example—that body of laymen who are
giving of their time. energy and re-
sources to help keep strong and grow-
ing the national recreation movement."

    last July. While the reports from the field

And its significance for the inter-
pretation of community recreation

HERE WAS a hush on the playgrounds of the
Tnation. Flags were lowered to half mast; tens

of thousands of children listened reverently
for a few moments to the story of Joseph Lee, the
friend of little children. Then came a rush of
joyous activity as the children and their leaders
entered into the events that had been planned to
observe National Joseph Lee Day. The record of
what happened on that day is not only in the files
of a host of grateful executives but is deeply en-
graved on the hearts of those who shared the fun
and fellowship of that memorable day. Children
had learned of a great man, suitably called “one
of God’s playfellows,” who gave his life and for-
tune that they, and all children to come after them,
might have a chance to play. So they played that
day in memory of Joseph Lee.

And now requests have come from all over the
United States for a second observance of Na-
tional Joseph Lee Day. After careful considera-
tion the Board of Directors of the National Rec—
reation Association have acceded to that request
and have set Friday, July 28th, as the day.

As we look forward to another Joseph Lee Day,
perhaps the most helpful thing we can do is to
review some of the things that actually happened

will be referred to, it is well known that
many celebrations occurred of which we
have no written record. '

The purpose of National Joseph Lee Day, ac-

cording to the National Committee, was to com-

memorate the life and work of Joseph Lee and to
interpret the importance of community recreation.

What Was Done to Interpret Community
Recreation

The efforts of interpretation were (significant.
A large number of cities all over the United
States and four countries participated in some
way in the observance of Joseph Lee Day. In all
of these some attempt was made to acquaint chil-
dren and adults with the life and work of Joseph
Lee, through the newspaper, the radio, and by
events on the playgrounds and in community
centers.

In several hundred cities where there was no
active observance the newspapers carried editori-
als in honor of Joseph Lee, used his picture, or
reported on activities in some other city which
actually observed the day.

A special letter with the brochure was sent to
columnists whose materials are syndicated. Bruce
Catton wrote a column on Joseph Lee and Joseph
Lee Day which was widely printed, constituting
the bulk of the publicity in non-participating
cities. Most papers used it as an editorial, but
some credited the copy to Catton. One paper used
it in the “Voice of the People” signed “An
Anxious West Sider.”

60 NATIONAL JOSEPH LEE DAY

National and local broadcasts carried the mes-
sage over every network in the country. Com-
mentators made special note of the day, and dis-
tinguished speakers such as Charles Francis
Adams spoke of the life and work of Joseph Lee.

Local broadcasts were made in some cities, ty-
ing in the local situation with the national com-
memoration.

Proclamations declaring July 28th as Joseph
Lee Day were made by Governor Hurley of Mas-
sachusetts and by the mayors in a number of
cities. Mayor James E. Dunne of Providence,
Rhode Island, issued the following:

PROCLAMATION

Thursday, July 28th, will be known
throughout the nation as “Joseph Lee Day,”
and thousands of children and adults will
take part in festivities, exercises and games
in celebration of the day, observed for the
first time this year.

Joseph Lee, who died last year, was

~ known as the “father of the playground
movement in America.” He gave his en-
tire life to the promotion of good causes
and most of his inherited income he gave
away quietly to advance playgrounds, edu-
cation, social service, housing and other
c1v1c improvements.

As Mayor of the City of Providence, I
am heartily in accord with this movement
of setting aside a special time to pay tribute
to the life and work of Joseph Lee. Ap-
propriate exercises will be held on the play-
grounds of our city in order to bring the
attention of those gathered there just what
Joseph Lee meant to the Playground Life
in our nation.

Activities

The type of activity which occurred most fre-
quently was the informal, usually brief memorial
program, on the playground around the flagpola
or in the evening when adults were present.

Many cities combined commemorations of
Joseph Lee Day with a track meet, a field meet
or swimming meet. Some used the day to run off
finals in tournaments started earlier in the sum-
mer. Among the happiest events was playing the
favorite games of Joseph Lee, singing his favorite
songs, and dancing his favorite dances. No
speeches or formal ceremony could mean so much
to the children as these simple joyous activities.

Libraries and stores cooperated by displaying
special exhibits of recreation books, pictures and

material about Joseph Lee. Where attempts were
especially made to interest adults with the pro-
grams of the playgrounds and community centers,
there were displays of arts and crafts work, na-
ture collections, and similar exhibits.

The pageant “Pursuit of Joy” which was sent
out by headquarters was used in a number of
cities and was very well received. In Westchester
County, New York, fourteen towns cooperated in _
the pageant using a cast of 500 children and play- f
ing before a large audience.

The Child’s Biography of Joseph Lee was used 
in a number of localities, posted or read or dis-
tributed.

Addresses at Service Club meetings on the sig-
nificance of the life and leadership of Joseph Lee
carried the message to a wide spread group of
influential adults.

Various other activities such as soap, clay and
sand modeling of Joseph Lee’s head or profile,
essay contests, carnivals, circuses, fairs, story
telling hours devoted to Joseph Lee, festivals and
nature hikes were a part of the many programs.

Having learned that Joseph Lee loved picnics
and hiking through the woods, one city built a
part-of ,its celebration of National Joseph Lee
Day around a nature program.

Significant Observances

Boston, as Joseph Lee’s home for many years,
had a particularly fine Joseph Lee Day. Charles
Francis Adams had spoken over the Columbia
3roadcasting System from Boston on July 25th,
so Boston was prepared for the Day. Governor
Hurley designated July 28th as Joseph Lee Day
“to memorialize the services of one of the fore-
most citizens and benefactors of the State of ;‘
Massachusetts and of the whole nation.”

At the dedication of Joseph Lee Playground in '
the morning, the President of the City Council
gave the dedicatory address and the Fire Com-
missioner also gave an address. The remainder
of the ceremony was given over to group play
engaged in by 2,000 children. In the afternoon
there were playground demonstrations on all park ,
department playgrounds, and an adult arts and
crafts exhibit on Boston Common. In the eve-
ning, I ,000 boys participated in the Greater Bos-
tOn Playground Olympic Games at South Boston
Stadium, and on Boston Common the adult rec-
reation project of \VPA, Drama Division, put on
a pageant with episodes depicting Joseph Lee’s
battle for Boston playgrounds.

Boston newspapers cooperated very well and
gave the day a great deal of publicity. Commis-
sioner Long of the Park
Department headed a large
Boston Committee.

Houston, Texas, had al—
ready planned on July 28th
as the date of their folk fes-
tival, the crowning event of
the summer program. They
dedicated this program of .
folk dances by representatives of the many na—
tionalities to Joseph Lee. The Mayor of Houston
issued a procla-
mation making
July 28th Joseph

grounds through-
out the city the
week was given
over to activities
in memory of Mr.

Lincoln, Nebraska, featured
visitors’ day on all the play-
grounds, inviting the public to
come out and see what was being
done. In the evening there were
entertainments on the grounds

and a member of the local committee, headed by
Mrs. Fred R. Easterday of the National Commit-

tee, was at each playground
to welcome visitors.

Boat Building in the Chicago Park District

.'

rfAT’s NEW about the din—
w ghy? Just this. Formerly

used as a tender by large
motor boats or yachts and propelled by oars or by
means of a motor, it has, by the addition of sails,
become a smart sailing yacht. The dinghy has
been streamlined—at least in Chicago!

With all its facilities for water sports, Chicago
has until recently lagged in small boat building
chiefly because of the prohibitive cost. This was
changed when the Lake Michigan Yachting Asso-
ciation of Chicago took a hand. Believing that the
growing youth of
Chicago would
benefit by an inter-
est in boating, the
Association secured
from Phil Rhodes,
noted naval archi-
tect, a simplified
type of plan for a
speedy little dinghy.
The Chicago Park
District was then
asked to organize a
number of junior
yacht clubs from
among the boys who
participated in park
activities.

Thus originated the now
famous Rainbow Fleet, or-
ganized to bring Chicago’s
great lake front to the youth
of the city who might other-
wise have no opportunity to
become acquainted with the
sport of sailing on Lake
Michigan. There are now
thirteen clubs in the fleet which have built a tdtal
of twenty—four boats.

Any Chicago boy between the ages of fourteen
and nineteen, even though he has had no previous
sailing experience, may become a member of the
junior yacht club at no expense to himself. To
date the Lake Michigan Yachting Association has
purchased all materials for the construction of
thirty of these sailing dinghies, and no expense
has been spared in securing the best of materials.

By F. E. KARDES

TechnicianI Crafts Department

 

Dinghy racing as an organized sport is
comparatively new. During recent years
it has become quite popular in the EastI
and has reached the stage where inter-
collegiate races are held. And now, in
Chicago. the Rainbow Fleet sponsored by
the Lake Michigan Yachting Association

of Chicago and the Park District is dot-
ting the waters of lakes and lagoons.

The hulls are built of mahogany
and oak, the spars of spruce, and

the fittings and hardware of
bronze.

The boats are made in the various craft shops
maintained by the Park Department. As boat
building is a somewhat new phase of craft work,
it was found necessary first to give the various
craft instructors a thorough understanding of the
required technique. This was accomplished by
holding a series of institute sessions and having
the instructors construct the first boat. As was

expected, difficul-
ties were encoun-
tered, but in gen-
eral the work was
carried out success-
fully, and now many
of the junior yacht
club members are
capable of carrying
on the boat build-
ing program with
little or no instruc-
tion.

Safety Measures

The finished din-
ghy remains the
property of the
Rainbow Fleet but is avail-
able at all times during the
sailing season for use by
members who have passed
the swimming and safety
tests established by the Park
District. During the build-
ing program technical in-
struction is given the boys
in sailing, and they are required to pass certain
swimming tests. In addition to these tests they
are given the opportUnity to take'the Junior Red
Cross life saving and first aid course.

‘One of the principal requirements in the swim-
ming test is that a boy must be able to swim two
hundred yards in open water and demonstrate his
ability to swim fifty yards fully clothed in deep
water. The first test qualifies him to be a crew
member in moderate weather; additional tests

carry him through various
stages to unlimited skip-

per privileges.

Except in the case of

races or intercity regat—
tas, all sailing is done in
the protected waters of
Burnham Park Lagoon.
The sailing is further safe—
guarded by the presence
of the instructor, life guard
lookout, and an emergency
lifeboat which is always
ready to speed to the aid
of a disabled or capsized dinghy.

The boat designed for the Rainbow Fleet by
Mr. Rhodes is a modified Frostbite dinghy of the
center board type, I0 feet in length, 52 inches in
beam, and carries 75 square feet of sail. Carry-
ing out the theme of the Rainbow Fleet, the sails
are multicolored, and each club has its own burgee
in the same colors. Every junior club is organized
as a regular yacht club, having its regularly
elected commodores, vice-commodores, and other
officers.

Interest Grows

With the advent of the Rainbow Fleet, the gen-
eral interest in boat building has grown by leaps
and bounds and has spread to older boys and men
who are desirous of building boats which they
may retain as their own property. Exhibits
in the various boat
and sport shows
have aroused ,so
much interest in
small boat building
that our facilities
and instructional
staff are being tax-
ed to the utmost,
and two new sh0ps
have been establish-
ed the activities in
which are confined
entirely to boat
building.

In addition to
the parks in which
Rainbow Fleet
boats are being
built, there are now

"Boat building is a fascinating. socializing
sport. and while the boy is dreaming of skip-
pering his craft in a leisurely lake or lagoon
he is unconsciously laying the foundation for
the development of dexterous hands.a healthy
body. and a contented mind. Building a boat
requires a high type of craftsmanship. teaches
exactness in wood working. and in the neces-
sary fitting and ioining it develops superior
mechanical skills. In fact. the construction
work. and the swimming and sailing tests re-
quired all aid in building the faculties on
which depend accurate iudgment. The train-
ing the boy receives cannot fail to help
produce a sound balance between mind and
body. as well as a broader outlook on life."

 

four other craft shops car-
rying on a major boat
building program. The
members of the Gage
Park Yacht Club alone
produced fifteen Class “B”
or eleven and one-half
foot dinghies last winter.
The National One design,
a seventeen foot boat, has
been quite popular and
about ten have been built in
different parks. Another
boat which is being built
extensively at this time is
the Sea Gull which is eighteen feet in length.

Building is not confined entirely to sailing boats
as several small motor cruisers are now under
construction and two Sea Scout groups are build-
ing twenty~six foot cutters.

One of the principal reasons for the popularity
of small boat building is the fact that splendid,
seaworthy boats may be built for as little as $100.
As this cost is spread over the period necessary to
construct the craft, it puts boat building within
reach of hundreds of men and older boys in our
city. Needless to say, of course, the splendid shop
facilities of the Park District and competent in-
structors are essential to a boat building program
of this magnitude.

Kayaks and Canoes as Well

The desire of many boys to build even cheaper
boats than the sail-
ing dinghies has re-
sulted in an exten—
sive program of
kayak and canoe
building. In this
t y p e o f w o r k
elaborate shop fa-
cilities, machinery
and equipment are
not required, and
there are about
twenty parks in
which large num-
bers of such craft
and other water
sports equipment is
being built.

The Craft Program Goesto the Waterfront

URING THE PAST few years
much consideration has
been given to the impor-

tance of correlating crafts very closely with other
recreational activities. So far, the waterfront crafts
seem to have been a neglected field. The use of crafts
with nature study has long been employed where
nature prints, plaster casts and aquariums help to
motivate the program. More and more we find
those leaders interested in recreation music, mak-
ing shepherd pipes or simple stringed instruments
for use with their community singing group. Per-
cussion instruments are easily constructed and are
becoming popular for use with the dance.

Let us consider the possibilities that waterfront
crafts have to offer and see if they cannot be
made more p0pular in the outdoor program this
summer.

Waterfront crafts are not new; in fact, they
are probably among the oldest on record. Primi-
tive man must have sat along the shore or river
bank while he fashioned his boat out of materials
he found that would float. Today we look back on
dugout and birch bark canoes with carved or
painted paddles and fibre fish—
nets as curiosities, but many of
them represent the superb crafts-
manship of primitive
man. South American
Indians on Lake Titi-
cara fashioned boats
from bundles of straw
and wheat. A famous
Carthagenian, Hannibal,
in his fight with the
Romans is credited with
building a boat under
which were tied hun-
dreds of gourds to make
it float. .

VVaterwings are an-
other form of water-
front craft that seems
to have been used for
many centuries. For
thousands of years
Chinese living on boats
have been accustomed to

Have you ever thought of all the
things you can make from shells?

 

tie large gourds to their babies to
keep them afioat should they fall
overboard. Pieter Brueghel, a
Flemish painter of the 16th century, in his famous
painting of children playing games has shown a
child keeping afloat in a stream by means of
waterwings.

Very often the camper or the craftsman who
loves the open seeks the woods for an interesting
medium from which to create his craft. He might
fare equally well if he were to take a stroll along
the shore. There he can find beautiful shells to
set his creative mind to work, or the driftwood
and rocks washed in from other shores might
stir his imagination. If he wishes to make some-
thing simply to utilize material at hand, creating
projects from shells or driftwood will satisfy this
urge. Or, if he wants to add pleasure to his stay
at the waterfront, let him make games that can
be played in the water.

The educational angle, too, can be considered in
selecting a craft. Why not make a weathervane
and place it on the waterfront so the boats can be
brought to shore properly and docked according
to the direction of the wind?
There are many kinds of ba-
rometers that are easily con-
structed and lend in-
terest to the study of
weather. Nautical in-
struments such as ones
used in making charts
may also be made. A
chip log, like those used
years ago, will afford
much pleasure to chil-
dren in measuring how
fast their canoe or row-
boat is traveling.

Things to Make

From Shells. Every
shore offers an abund-
ance of shells, and yet
almost no use has been
found for them in the
craft field. Not so many
years ago nearly every

65

66 THE CRAFT PROGRAM GOES TO THE WATERFRONT

farmer’s wife used a large
shell as a trumpet to call
the men folk in from the
field at meal time (Figure
1). Such a shell trumpet
might be useful today in
camp, or for signaling while
on a hike. They are easily
made by boring a hole in the
side of the shell and cutting
off the apex in which to
blow. There should be many
uses for the broad flat shells
similar to those of the fresh
water clam. They can be
used as individual bake
dishes (Figure 2) ; paint
pots for the craft room
(Figure 3); or bulbs may
be planted in them, converting them immediately
into dish gardens. The smaller shells may be
pierced and strung together with elastic for brace-
lets (Figure 4); or they can be fashioned into
boutonnieres. Very attractive necklaces can also
be made by combining them with native seeds
(Figure 5).

Games. Games that may be contrived with lit-
tle craft knowledge are as numerous as the in-
dividual’s capabilities for imagination. Two sim-
ple games are suggested-—
one for use in the water and
the other for the beach. There
is a water quoits game
readily to be recognized
as being adapted from
the one used on land or
more familiarly known
as “Horseshoes.” It is
made by placing a round
stick about fifteen
inches long in the cen-
ter of a round flat
board, with a long rope
attached to the bottom
in order to anchor it at
a given spot. Rings can
be fashioned from cork,
light wood or pressed
paper.. ‘

The beach game is
made by tying fish net
between two poles and
numbering the squares

shown in the illustration
(Figure 6). Two fisher-
man’s bobbers are tied to-
gether with a short string
and used for tossing at the
net. The bobbers will loop
through different holes to
make their points.

A Water Ball. The water
ball and animal shown in
Figure 7 are designed for
play days or pageants; they
are easily made and can be
as colorful as desired. They
are made from wrapping
paper and colored with
waxed crayons which pro-
tects them from the water.
The small diagram next to the ball shows its gen-
eral shape before it is sewed together. They last
longer if the seams are bound with a piece of
paper an inch in width which is folded in the
center and sewn with yarn or thread. Kapoc is
used for the stuffing, as it is light in weight and
its greasy quality tends to keep the water from
seaping inside. If the ball is large, clump up some
paper and use it for the center. Then cover it
with kapoc so the project will not become too ex-
pensive. Such balls and ani-
mals have lasted for three
days in the water.

Other Articles. The
bathing belt is made of
hard seine twine, Num-
ber 36, such as the cord

used in making fish

There are nine
strands of string the

and two longer lengths
are left at each end for

muda. (See Figure 8.)

may also be used to line compacts or a powder

puff bag.

A Novel Checkboard. The checkboard illus-
trated may be used either at the waterfront where
the swimmers are checked as they go in and out
of the water, or as an achievement board, which
is placed usually in the recreation hall. If it is
installed at the waterfront, it is suggested that
each child cut his own fish out of tin and paint
it the color of his cap. He may cut a mummy. a
gold fish, a trout or any hsh he chooses, and
punch a hole near the eye and another near the
top of the back. He hangs the fish Up by the
hole in the back while in swimming, and by the
hole in the eye while on land. If the board is to
be used as an achievement chart, the fish may be
made of colored construction paper or cardboard.

Using Fish Nets. For many years, the wives of
the fishermen along the Virginian shores and
other coasts made nets while their husbands were
making practical use of them on their fishing
trips. Finally a machine was invented that could
produce thousands of yards of fish nets in a single
year, so that the women could no longer compete
with the market. The Works Progress Adminis-
tration, finding these women destitute several
years ago, discovered a commercial use for net-
ting and now they have a new use for their skill.

Scarfs made from net are now being sold at all

And where will you find a more
ingenious checkboard than this?

From an old fisherman in Bermuda came
the directions for melting this belt

summer resorts, and in the past season new ones
appeared dyed in beautiful colors. Netting is also
being used for curtains, luncheon cloths, bed
spreads and other decorations appropriate for
summer use. These projects can be made at any
waterfront and are useful as accessories or for
decorations in the cabins or homes.

An attractive bathing suit bag would be very ap-
propriate for the waterfront and it can easily be
made from fish net. Usually someone can be
found in the neighborhood that can teach netting,
and certainly there is an opportunity to visit the
fishermen along the shore and be introdtlced to
the ancient craft in its real setting. The bags can
be made in any size, and if they are made from

regular fish cord it is not necessary to line them.

A Hobby Craft Program for Cleveland

in recreation though adult

crafts are comparatively
new in our program. In our
first eXperiment, the open-
ing of a well equipped work-
shop for adults, we were
not seeking for novelty of
approach or presentation,
but for a definite goal to
strive for which would be
within reach of our limited
resources. Should our effort
be to turn out skilled crafts-
men concentrating only on
'those with evident talents? Should our attempts
be in the direction of producing pieces suitable for
exhibition or should the emphasis be placed on the
individual’s reaction to the craft?

C RAFT PROGRAMS are not new

Crafts as Hobbies

We decided to develop the program on the
hobby basis with the emphasis-on the individual
rather than the craft. Our whole objective in the
program became that of giving opportunities of a
varied nature to every interested person; of help-
ing him find the activity that interested him most,
and of developing an interest which would grow
with experience and have a lasting value for the
individUal.

With this principle in mind, the question of
what crafts to pre-
sent took on new
importance. We had
to decide whether
to choose the “fad”
type of craft that
. crops up now and
then, runs its short
course with a burst
of enthusiasm and
dies, or to spend
our limited funds on
materials and tools
for crafts that have
long been recogniz-

ed and practiced.
We decided with-

out hesitation that

What is to be the purpose of the program?
What crafts shall be offered? How can the
leadership available be most effectively
used and the limited funds at our disposal
most efficiently spent? How may the op-
portunities for craft activities best be
presented to the public? In the answers
to questions such as these lay the solution
to the problems faced by the Cleveland
Division of Recreation in planning its
program of crafts for adults.

 

our policy would be to concen-

trate on the long established

crafts. Jewelry, metal craft,
marionette making, wood-
craft, leather craft, and
game craft took their place -
on the list along with rug
making, weaving, sewing,
and quilting. A number of
other crafts, as, for exam-
ple, ceramics, enameling and
bookbinding, were” tempo- ,
rarily omitted because of
the initial cost involved or
lack of trained leaders.

Leadership and Materials
How could we stretch our leadership to cover

the entire program? Each of the seven leaders

had other duties three days of the week, leaving
only two full days for each leader for instruction
in crafts. Each leader decided which craft he
liked,best and was most proficient in, then made a
special study of it and outlined a series of short-
term projects. Thus instead of seven miscellan-
eous craft leaders we had a staff of craft special-
ists, each prepared to answer questions on his
particular specialty and well able to conduct a
program in that particular craft.

With a large program in mind and a very small
pocketbook, our next question was how can we
make each dollar do
the work of five?
Is it advisable to ;
buy materials or.
spend all our money
on permanent tools?

We bought per-
manent tools. The
purchase of a lathe, '
buzz saw, jig saw, '
and an electric ,
motor nearly ex-
hausted our budget
allotted to wood- :
craft. Through ‘
careful buying we r'
managed to secure
a hammer or two, ‘

A Rovers' Archery Course in Milwaukee

HE ROVERS’ ARCHERY course in Milwaukee had
Tits origin in one of the boys’ clubs maintained

by the Department of Municipal Recreation
and Adult Education. The boys had become adept
making their own bows and arrows and in shoot-
ing at regulation targets, and interest was some—
what on the wane. There was need for devising
a plan which would catch the imagination of the
boys and make them feel more akin to the Indians
they were emulating, whose feats with the bow
and arrow were far famed.

Animal Targets

And so the idea of a rovers’ archery course
came into being. Why shoot at a regulation tar-
get when you were reliving the days of the Indian
roaming the forest with bow and arrow in search
of food? “Shoot at animals,” was the answer to
that question. So the boys began constructing
targets which would represent animals.

These targets are made of six thicknesses of
corrugated cardboard sewed or wired together.
(Corrugated cardboard can be obtained from any

local merchant.)
On the face of
each target is
painted the pic-
ture of an animal
or bird, usually
one and a half
times larger than
life size. Deer,
bears, wild fowl,
geese, rabbits, clay
pigeons, foxes,
lions, tigers, and
other denizens of
the forest are cre-
ated. In painting

the animals every effort is made to approximate
their natural colors. Water colors have been
found most satisfactory for the purpose. It is
helpful to make a sample target base out of ten
so that it can serve as a pattern in making other
targets.

When the targets are completed they are
mounted on two or more stakes, depending on the
size and weight of the target and the number of
supports needed, and driven into the ground at
least a foot for support. If this is not‘done, when
the arrow hits the target it will jar and crack the
whole structure. Wiring the target to the stake
is more practicable than nailing it because if an
arrow hits a nail it is liable to break.

Through the use of these targets the boys learn
much about animals and conservation. They come
to realize the incorrectness of putting a doe on a

of a buck and
of shooting
such birds as
robins and blue-

vices make shooting more dif-
ficult and increase the shoot-

er’s skill.

Moving targets are popular and there

Type of Targets. Moving targets are popular. A
target is cut out in the shape of an animal and
hung from an easel, and a cord is attached to it
so that it may be swung either automatically or by
hand. Other types of targets may be used. I have
seen an old mattress rolled together with perhaps
a head on it and an apple on top of the head—a
perfect setting for the William Tell act! The
greater variety of targets the more interesting will

the rovers’ course be.

The Course

There are two types of rovers’ course ranges.
The first type is semi—circular in form, and is de-
signed more especially for tourna—
ment use; the other is the form of a

large circle.

An ideal’location for
a range is- one in which
there is a semicircular
hill in the background
to stop arrows in flight.
It is highly desirable
from the standpoint of
safety to have a rather
high embankment in

back of the targets to 

st0p arrows which miss
the mark. The targets
are placed in a semi—
circular form and the
position of shooting is

safety must be taken into account at all times, this
is a major consideration. It is interesting to note
in this connection that since the recent revival of
this sport no one has been killed by an arrow.

The second type of rovers’ range involves a
large circle. Here again it is ideal, though not
absolutely necessary, to have a fairly high em—
bankment surrounding the circle to stop arrows
which have missed their mark. This method of
layout is somewhat similar to that of 'clock golf
in which players shoot at one target and go on to
the next, the range changing from target to tar-
get. If properly laid out a regular
archery shooting range can be made

eral acres if possible. As a safety precaution ade-
quate signs should be posted indicating that shoot-
ing is going on. N 0 one should be allowed to get
behind the flight of arrows, and spectators must
remain in back of those shooting.

Scoring

In scoring no“ target counts more than ten or
twelve points. Rings are drawn around the tar-
get, and the most vulnerable part of the animal
carries the highest score. The more difficult the
target, the lower the score for the reason that the
more experienced archer, although he does gain a
hit in the more difficult target, will not in the end
have a great deal higher score than the poorer
archer. In this way the less experienced and suc-
cessful archer will not be discouraged by his score.

It is well to use a standard method for scoring
each target, taking into consideration the contest-
ant’s shot and the size of the target.

By using higher mathematics, our groups have
devised a scoring system which is uniform for all
targets. It takes into consideration the diameter
of the bull’s-eye, the diameter of the arrow, and
the shooting range or distance. The following are
the elements of the formula:

S= maximum possible score

K= constant. It is determined by assuming a

score for one target and working the
problem backward.

D= diameter of the bull’s-eye in inches

=- diameter of the arrow in inches
R= range in yards
Formula: 5 = K (D—|—d)
R

The group has also devised a score sheet which
makes use of the above formula. Across the top
of the sheet is the diameter of the bull’s-eye in
inches, and down the left-hand side is the range
in yards. All possible scores are worked out
ahead of time, so it is merely a matter of consult-
ing the card and adding up the scores to deter-
mine the linal score.

Although this is a rather complex method of
scoring, it has many advantages over the average
method of scoring. The extreme accuracy in
scoring is its outstanding characteristic. Archery
-associati0ns ‘all over the country have faced the
problem of a uniform scoring system in order to
hold telegraphic meets. We believe we have
solved this problem.

General Suggestions on Equipment

We have found that it adds to the boys’ inter—
est in archery if they make their own equipment.
In Milwaukee the boys buy their own material,
and the average type of wood they can afford is
ash or hickory or rock elm. If this is bought in
large quantities in six foot lengths about eight
inches wide and ripped into proper bow widths
of 1% to 1%; inches, it is possible for the boy to
make a bow stave for about 35 cents. If a better
type of bow is desired, lemon wood or yew or
osage orange should be used. The last two woods
mentioned are the best.

The boys make two types of bows—the Indian
flat bow and the round bow. The flat variety is
easier to make and more mathematically correct
than the round bow, though the latter type is
more beautiful when completed.

We usually buy the arrows in the dowel form

' 28 inches long. The boys put steel heads on the

arrows, fletch them, and cut in knocks. They also
make their own strings out of either No. 12 or
N o. 25 linen thread which is marked in different
ways in different parts of the country. Many of
the boys have gone even further and made their
own archery tackle. Such things as quivers, arm—
guards, and finger tips are examples.

Why Have a Rovers’ Course?

A rovers’ archery course has a number of ad-
vantages. It makes archery more interesting;
though less scientific in certain respects it is more
fun; it accommodates more people at a time and
has all of the physical values of the regulation
game. A recreation department will find it well
worth while to develop one of these interesting

COLII'SCS.

NOTE: In submitting this material Mr. Breeden ex-
presses his appreciation to Vincent E. Victoreen for his
work on the uniform scoring formula and scoring sheet
and to C. G. Whitman for his design of targets.

“Along with the revival of interest in all sports
of the individual type, archery is being used by
a fast-increasing number of men, women and chil-
dren as an absorbing leisure-time activity. There
are probably several reasons for this growth of
interest. One is the fact that the new method of
shooting which is being developed is easier to
learn and tends to be more accurate than the old.
Another is the deveIOpment of more efficient and
accurate bows and arrows, and the fascination
many people find in the making of their own arch—
ery tackle.”—From M odem Methods in Archery.

WhatrfThey Say About Recreation

ll ov IN PHYSICAL RECREATION may be com-
J pounded of many elements, including pleas-
ure in the actual activity, relaxation and
change, pleasant surroundings, companionship,
anticipation and memory. There is satisfaction
in doing well some physical thing.”—-—Dndley B.
Reed, M.D., in Keep Fit and Like It.

“We must see youth clearly—our boys and girls
who long to be happy, to go places, to feel and
experience life; who want to work at tasks they
love, and play with those they love, and some day
become the parents of children they will love;
who want a part in making over this world along

lines of their own adventurous thinking and who ,

dream of rendering their service to humanity.”—
Frances 5. Pettengill, President, National Con-
gress of Parents and Teachers.

“Always people have liked to make plays. Some-
times they have made them just for fun: to amuse
themselves and others, and to make people laugh.
Sometimes they have made them as artists paint
pictures, and musicians compose music, and chil—
dren build block houses: for the joy of creating a
thing of beauty.”-——Margnerite Fellows Melcher
in Ofstage.

“I do not care by what term you call what I
have in mind. You may call it culture if you like.
What I am pleading for is the recognition of the
supreme importance of the enrichment of the
inner life of the youth of today and tomorrow.
In so far as education can accomplish this, much
that distresses us in the inequalities and injustices
and confusions of the life about us will vanish.”

-—Dr. Harry W oodbnrn Chase in Planning the
Future with Youth.

“There is nothing more essential to the liva-
bility of communities than an allowance for an
adequate background of open land. Such allow-
ance as this will become more important as the
margin of human leisure continues to Widen.”—
Karl B. Lohmann in Regional Planning.

“There are new forces in the world, new pa-
trons of architecture. A new architecture is being
born—an architecture for the people. It is proj-

72

ects of social value, parks, swimming pools, tre-
mendous dams and power plants and schools that
form the great architecture today. A new vision
of decently housing all the people has come in like
a breath of fresh air. That is what has changed
and is changing our architecture today. The
architect is beginning to realize his opportunity
and his duty to the people. They are his really
significant patrons.”———Talbot Hamlin in Bulletin
of the American Library Association.

 

“Today, with vastly increased leisure and edu-
cational facilities, the common working man can
become as broadly educated as were formerly only
the aristocratic few. And if the masses are taught
to use their leisure in such a way as to enrich
their lives, this can be made a more civilized
world.”-——Dr. Harry A. Overstreet.

Mark M cCloskey.

“A challenging job confronts us all. The home,
the church, the school must each do its part but
you as playground directors and recreation lead-
ers have an equally important task to perform.
Yours is essentially a great adventure in social
relations and a splendid Opportunity to mold the
character of the plastic material with which you

“We need a new conception of life. It must con—
cern itself less with the number of years we live
and more with how we live them. After all, there
is plenty of evidence that some men live more in

ten years than others do in ten decades.”—Gabriel
Heatter in Faith.

"The great problem before us today is to create
a civilization that does not degenerate under lei—
sure. This can be done only by setting in opera-
tion forces making for a culture that recognizes,
as no civilization since the fall of Rome has been
required to do, that leisure must be a means and
not an end; that its value is measured by what we
do with it as to Whether it lifts or lowers us in

playground theater.

There is a thrill in
transforming almost
overnight a corner or a
barren portion of a play-
ground into a thing of
real beauty which will
serve many purposes. The playground theater
adds to the general landscape development of the
area. It is simple and inexpensive to construct and
economical to maintain. The planting of decidu-
ous shrubs or evergreens, the establishing of a
lawn, or the introduction of a tree or two may be
all that is necessary in the construction process.
In the case of an existing lawn area, it becomes
merely a problem of adaptation.

It must be clearly understood that this article
is dealing with the natural types of playground
theaters which depend entirely upon natural fea-
tures for effects. This means, of course, that
there will be no artificial scenery, draw curtains,
or specially constructed wooden stages, as is typi-
cal of the indoor theater. The structural theater
of the playground with its artificial scenery and
effects, sometimes permanent but often portable,
has been used successfully in various playgrounds
throughout the country. This type of theater is
very popular and adapted to certain types of dra-
matic productions. It usually means the introduc-
tion of a portable stage in as.desirable a setting as
possible, which is immediately removed after the
production is over. The construction of a per-
manent theater of this type which will materially
contribute to the aesthetic value of the playground
involves a great deal of expense.

The permanent natural theater which we are
discussing is inexpensive
to construct. It is made
up primarily of living
plant materials, ever-
changing in character. Each
season of the year brings
forth different color and
texture effects. Even in
the wintertime, if care-
fully planned, it can be a
thing of unusual charm.

Some suggestions for the design and
construction of playground theaters

By P. ELLWOOD ALLEN
National Recreation Association

In the first part of this discussion of play-
ground theatersI which appeared in the April
issue of Recreation, Mr. Allen outlined three
types of theaters—the informal, semiformal
and formal, and presented a plan for the pro-
posed playfield-park for Watertown, South
Dakota, showing a theater of the formal type.
In this article he continues his discussion
of natural types of theaters which depend
entirely on natural features for effects. and
takes up problems of grading, drainage, soil'
and types of plant materials to be used.

haps to mention briefly
some of the general prob-
lems involved in the con-
struction of the natural
playground theater, such
as grading, drainage, soil,
and types of plant ma—
terials, before discussing
the individual problems pertaining to each theater
type.

Grading. Abrupt changes in grade should be
avoided. The grade should be uniform regardless
of slope. If the stage is elevated there should be
a slight pitch toward the apron for surface drain-
age. This pitch should not exceed an inch and a
half for every ten feet. (See Figure 3.) When
the stage and the auditorium are on the same
level it will only be necessary to provide enough
slope for surface drainage. (See Figure 2.) The
direction of the pitch depends on the size and
design of the theater and the topography. A
pitch from the periphery of the theater to a point
at the imaginary or actual center of the stage
apron (provided with a catch basin) would be
ideal. T erracing is not recommended for the play-
ground theater except where the slope of the audi-
torium is so steep that terracing is necessary for
erosion control. Terraces are expensive to con-
struct and very costly to maintain. All top soil
should be removed and stored before the grading
operation, and then replaced over the area for the
establishing of a turf.

Drainage. Drainage is a very important factor
in the construction of the outdoor theater. If the
soil is porous and has natural drainage, very little
needs to be done. If, however, the soil is heavy

or impervious, it will be necessary to provide sub—

drainage by tiling. One
catch basin will probably
be necessary at the low
point to carry off surplus
surface water. The size
and type of basin will de-
pend entirely on the size
and topography of the
area. Often a six inch vit-
rified tile with wrought
iron grating connected
with proper underground

73

74 SUNBEAMS FOR FOOTLIGHTS

outlets will serve for all practical purposes. The
principles covering drainage for any lawn, play,
or planted area are applicable to the playground

theater.
Soil. As the theater is constructed of living

plants, the soil should be prepared according to
standard planting specifications. At least three
inches of top soil will be necessary for the estab-
lishing of a turf area. Beds for plant materials
should be carefully prepared before planting and
should be provided with sufficient top soil to in-
sure satisfactory growth. It will probably be
necessary to supply some form of fertilizer both
to the soil of the lawn area and of the planting
beds, either in the form of commercial fertilizer
or barnyard manure.

Types of Plant Material. Plant materials should
be selected to serve their special use, namely for
screen purposes. This means that dense foliage
will be necessary where plants are used for wings
and background. The habit and character of
growth of the plants should be carefully studied
as well as their
adaptability to
shearing or
pruning. Only the
hardy, tested vari—
eties should be
used, and those
producingpleasing
effects. Varieties 3'" 734%} 1‘“
having thorns and
briers should be
avoided because of
the danger of in-
jury, and tearing
of clothing. It is
possible to select
materials that will
not only serve for ‘
screen purposes
but produce very
pleasing Winter,
spring, summer,
and fall effects.

the season is longer and the soil in better physi-
cal condition.

Care should be taken in the selection of the 7‘
seed mixture for the lawn. In the Atlantic coast
region and north to the Great Lakes, Kentucky
bluegrass has no superior for general lawn use.
A mixture of Kentucky bluegrass seven parts,
red top two parts, white clover one part, by
weight, has proven very satisfactory in producing
a durable lawn for concentrated use.

General Considerations. A planting and grad-
ing plan of the area should be prepared before
actual construction is begun. This plan would show
the size and arrangement of the beds, the type, size,
number and placement of plant materials, the lo-
cation of all drainage and water supply features,
and the existing and proposed elevations. Shrubs
are usually grouped in masses and rarely used as
specimens in this type of development.

Figures I, 2, and 3 illustrate respectively the
three types of playground theaters previously
mentioned—informal, semifOrmal, and formal.

This plan illustrates the arrangement of a proposed play-

All plant materials
suggested in these
plans are adapt-
able to the north-
eastern coastal and
Great Lakes regions
of the United States.

Figure I shows the
general arrangement
of suggested plant-
ing for the informal type of playground theater.
The stage is merely a part of a level lawn area in
the corner of a playground. Around the border
are plant materials for screen effects and to im-
prove the general landscape appearance of the
playground. The dotted lines in the beds repre-

sent the outline of one particular variety of shrub. '

For example, five Spirea Thunbergii would be
necessary for the space indicated for that variety
in the plan. The shape of the bed provides a

field showing the relation between the playground theater
and other facilities. It is interesting to note that the
theater is located near the shelter and away from noisy
types of activities. The tennis and horseshoe courts act
as transition between the quiet area and that devoted to
field activities. The plan takes- advantage of a terrace
slope for its auditorium and has a low elevated stage
supported by a retaining wall. The wings and backstage
areas are formed by mass planting of deciduous shrubs.

partial wing. The
imaginary apron of
the stage would ex-
tend from this ex—-
treme point to the
tree located thirty
feet away. Such an
arrangement is easily
adapted to other uses,
in addition to dra-
matics. It can be used for quiet games, for arts
and crafts, and is an excellent location for the
storytelling hour.

Figure 2 illustrates the semiformal type of
playground theater. There is only a slight change
in grade. The stage is not elevated, but a low,
dwarf privet hedge is designed to act as a divi-
sion between the auditorium and the stage. This
should be kept low, and not allowed to grow over
twelve inches high. A mass planting of W eigelia

76 SUNBEAMS FOR POOTLIGHTS

rosea forms one wing of the stage and the exten-
sion of the planting bed with the Siberian Dog—
wood forms the opposite wing. Here again the
area can be used for many types of activities as
well as for dramatics.

Figure 3 illustrates the formal type of play—
ground theater, with elevated stage. A dry wall
two and a half feet high forms the apron of the
turf stage. The wings and background shown in
hatch are solid blocks of sheared evergreens,
usually six feet high. There is an ample back-
stage area, completely screened by the surround—
ing shrubbery borders. Access to the stage is pro-
vided from the rear. The wall of the stage can be
of any type of material—stone, brick, concrete. For
pleasing effects and low construction cost, a dry
stone wall is most satisfactory. This type of wall
requires no foundation, and if the bonding ma-
terial is soil the joints between the stones can be
planted with alpines with interesting results. These
plants should be placed in the wall at the time of
construction and not inserted after the wall is
completed. In this way the roots of the plants
will have direct contact with the soil, which should
be thoroughly packed around them.

There are many alpines suitable for wall treat-
ment. Among the outstanding species are Dian-
thus deltoides, Saphonaria ocymoides, S edums in
variety, Alyssum, Phlox snbulata, C ampanula gar-
ganica, Ambis, and many others. These plants
are profuse bloomers and many of them are ever—
green throughout the year. They are all very
hardy. While the plan indicates Hemlock for the
wings and back-
ground, there are
many types of
evergreens satis-
factory for this
purpose. Arbor
Vitae, upright
Junipers, and
Yews are often
used for such
purposes. Any
evergreen that
can withstand
severe shearing
and attain the
necessary height
is satisfactory
for wings and
background.If
deciduous shrubs

are used for this purpose, it is best to select those
that adapt themselves to severe shearing and pro-
duce dense foliage from crown to t0p. Various
types of privets are the most satisfactory, and they
are inexpensive. The introduction of trees in con-
nection with the stage not only provides shade but
helps to create a more pleasing skyline effect.
Elms, maples, and oaks are standard hardy varie-
ties used but the occasional introduction of a semi- .
weeping willow, such as Salim elegantissima adds
variety and beauty in color and effect.

The width of the proscenium depends on the
type of use and the size of the area. Thirty feet
is usually considered a desirable width for most
activities. This type of theater is more difficult to
adapt to other playground uses than the informal
or the semiformal types. It is probably not feasi-
ble to construct the formal type unless there is a
keen interest in dramatic and musical activities.
Careful planning and programming, however, can
find many uses for it. It does have the distinct
advantage of inviting use.

The question of dressing rooms is often im-
portant in the outdoor natural theater. Usually an
adjacent shelter building or similar structure is
used for this purpose. It is sometimes practical

Rainy Day Programs for Camps

By DAN DRYDEN and BILL SCHAFER

HE PROBLEM of providing a good program for
Trainy days has long been a “headache” for

camp leaders. One of the reasons it has been
a problem is that it has been approached in the
wrong light. 'If counselors and directors could
look upon the rainy day as a boon, the problem
would be half solved. Variety is one of the things
we try to plan for in any recreation program, so
why shouldn’t we accept a change in the weather
and put it to use as we would any new activity?

It is not a bad idea to plan for a lull in activi-
ties once in a while and the rainy day is just the
time for a let-down. By this we do not mean that
the day should become boresome or that time
should hang heavy on the campers’ hands. There
are plenty of activities which can provide a lot of
fun and may be a welcome relief from the usual
more athletic type of program. If it is felt that
something exciting is needed to vary the program,
there is no lack of games of a more robust type
which may be played indoors, even if the space is
fairly limited.

Perhaps one of the best things counselors can
do is to give the campers a chance to use their
own ingenuity in dealing with the rainy day. That
is one of the things camp is supposed to develop,
and this is a good chance for a little practice. In
most cases weather has little effect on the natural
exuberance of children. They will find a great
many things to do if left to their own devices.
Of course something is needed to fill in the gaps
when the youngsters run out of good ideas tem-
porarily. For you may bank on it that they will
not be at a loss for something to do for very
long! If they run out of ideas that are acceptable
to the camp, they will soon concoct schemes that
may be somewhat devastating. However, if coun-
selors are on the lookout they
may be able to provide the neces-
sary stimulus or added ingenuity
which will produce a good activity
from a hazy or imperfect idea.

Why not, in the first place,
prove to campers that bad weather

The authors of these practical
suggestions on how to take the
gloom out of rainy days at camp
are both associated with the rec-
reation program ofthe Children's

Aid Society of New York City.

 

can be pleasant? The explanation of this paradox
will be apparent to the reader who has spent a
cold, blustery evening before a pleasant lire when
the sound of the wind and of the rain beating on
the roof has'seemed actually to add to the warmth
and angness of the room.

Another easily demonstrable point is that
many activities enjoyed during sunshiny weather
are just as pleasant to pursue in the rain
-—if one is properly equipped. We don’t know
whether the experts agree with us, but in our
youth we did a lot of fishing in the rain and en-
joyed it, especially trolling for bass and pike. We
do not remember whether the catch justified our
belief that a light rain enhanced our chances, but

. we do remember the main thing about it—and

that is that it was fun! Hiking or just going 'for
a walk in the rain will give campers a view of
beauties of nature not to be seen in fair weather.
Anyone who has seen a spider web adorned with
crystal raindrops or who has walked with the
summer rain in his face will appreciate this.

Swimming, too, can be fun if it is not overdone
and the air is not too cold. Perhaps it should be
suggested that this sort of activity should be en-
tirely voluntary, but that enthusiasm or a show of
interest on the part of counselors will engender
greater participation and also greater enjoyment
on the campers’ part. Campers also like to run
naked or almost so in a heavy downpour and it
can be done without harmful effects if care is
taken that it is not continued until the children
become too cold and that they have a good rub-
down afterwards.

A spirit of informality and do-as-you-please
will allow for relaxation and spontaneity. All or
as many as possible of the various camp depart-
ments should be available to the
campers. All counselors should
be “on tap” and ready for any-
thing. The craft shop, of course,
should be open, and it will in all
probability be well attended. Sug—

might include decorating the slickers or the can-
vas jackets youngsters are wearing these days,
and making miniature gardens. Certainly there
should be a place for wrestling, tumbling, boxing,
and general rough-housing. A few of the camp-
ers might like the chance to gather around the
piano and sing informally. Others might enjoy
just poking the fire to their own satisfaction!
Time spent about the fireplace in a good old-
fashioned bull session is not always wasted. There
is a good opportunity 0n rainy days for practice
in signalling and perhaps Indian sign talks. Quiet
games such as cards, Monopoly, Parchesi, check-

ers and chess will pass the time both pleasantly
and profitably. °

but with the proper attitude in

the many things that can be done
most of the unpleasantness can
be relieved. Make provision for
the comfort of the campers by
providing neatsfoot oil or any
other waterproofing material. It

ply of old clothing on hand to
replace wet outfits. Check camp-
ers’ blankets to see that they

may be thoroughly dried in a
commercial laundry.

A Few Rainy Day Programs

The following programs for
rainy days are by no means new,
but can be adapted to almost any
camp. We have used them and
found them both practical and
popular with the campers.

Scavenger Hunt. Prepare a list
of articles that are difficult to find

/ I on a rainy day. Organize group
/ / into teams and give each team the
I I, list of articles; the first team to
I return with all the articles wins

I I I the hunt.

Suggestions for the list are: a
dry leaf, a snail, a butterfly, a

Hunt muShl‘oom or puffball, a fish-

worm, a spider web.

Treasure Hunt. Treasure hunts have long been
a popular program at camps. A rainy day will
give it added‘ thrills and adventures. Make the
trail difficult, but not dangerous, to follow.

Cowboy and Indian Fight. This may be played
outdoors or indoors, if space is available. The
group is divided into two teams— Cowboys and
Indians. Each member of both teams is given a
number of gummed stickers.‘ At the signal, “War
declared,” teams try to capture each other by
sticking a gummed sticker on an opponent, thus
eliminating the captured player from the fight.
The team wins which captures all of its opponents.

This is an excellent game when played outdoors
(players wear trunks or bathing suits) where

RAINY DAY PROGRAMS FOR CAMPS 79

players can stalk opponents and hide behind
foliage and rocks.

Indoor Track Meet. An indoor track meet can
be held in a very limited space. The group is
divided into teams—a small number of players on
each team. The events in the track meet may be
such as:

Shot put—Shot is a blown up paper bag or

balloon.

Javelin throw ———- Javelin is a piece of broom

straw.

100 yd. dash—Dash over marked area hopping

on one foot. '

High Jump—on one foot.

Broad jump—on one foot.

Discus} throw—Discus is a paper pie plate or

cardboard disc.

Relay race—relays hopping on one foot.

Medley relay—crab walk, backward walk, and

snake walk.

Pole vault—standing pole vault for distance,

using broom stick for pole.

Hammer throw—Hammer is blown up paper

bag with string attached.

Peanut Party. Use the same organization as for
the indoor track meet, and offer novelty events
and races. Each team winning an event is per-
mitted to send a representative (the one with the
largest hand) to take a handful of peanuts. The
teams keep the peanuts until the events are fin-
ished and divide them among the members. Sug—
gested events for the party are:
potato race, using peanuts; a race
in which peanuts are pushed with
nose; needle-threading ' race in
which contestants race over given
distance, thread needle and re- , *CK)
turn; cracker eating race in which
each player eats three crackers and
whistles; and a match box relay.
In this stunt the first player sticks
his nose into one end of the lid
of a match box. He passes it on
to the second player by pushing
the other end onto the nose of
the second player withdrawing
his own nose. Neither player is

permitted to touch the lid with
his hands.

Stunt Party. The stunt party is
a program of events that are
mainly entertaining. Little or—

ganization is required as volunteers participate in
the events. Encourage all of the members of the

group to enter into at least one event. Suggested
events for the party are:

C hef’s hat boxing—paper bag is placed on the
heads of the boxers for hats; object is to knock
opponent’s ,hat off.

Paper tear-outs—Give every member of the
group a piece of paper. By folding or tearing
the paper countless numbers of figures and de-
signs can be made.

Friendly enemies—Two contestants, blindfold-
ed, lie prone on the Hoor facing each other. They
grasp left hands and hold swatter (roll of
paper) in their right hands.

A starts by calling to B, “Where are you?”
When B answers, “Here,” A strikes spot where
voice came from. In return B asks A where he
is and attempts to hit him.

Chinese get-up. Two players sit on the floor
back to back, with arms folded. Each presses
against the other’s back and attempts to rise to
a standing position without unfolding his arms.
Handkerchief pick-up — A handkerchief is
placed on the seat of a low chair. Player, stand-
ing on one foot with arms folded behind his
back, bends forward and attempts to pick up
the handkerchief with his teeth.

and rests forehead on short broomstick. Object

Playgrounds as Community Centers

THE OLD battle cry of

recreation leaders

“Playgrounds for
Children” is now giving
Way to a new and more
far-reaching slogan “Play-
grounds for Everyone” — for
youngsters, mother and dad,
big brother and sister, and the
man and woman next door.
Formerly a playground was
open from nine in the morning until five at night.
Now playgrounds are open, with supervision,
from nine in the morning, or earlier, until dark
and, in many instances, until ten or eleven at
night. The old playground program consisted
largely of games, sports and swimming, with a
smattering of dancing, handcraft and dramatics
for children. Many playgrounds displayed signs:
“For children under sixteen years of age,” and
parents visited the playground at the closing ses-
sion or on a special occasion to watch a play,
exhibit or demonstration of the activities of their
children.

A Center for All!

The new conception of a playground is a gath-
erinng place, a community center, so to speak,
where children have the use of the facilities and
play space during the day, but where everyone in
the neighborhood can congregate at night for
games, swimming, handcraft, movies, hobby in-
terests, social dancing, band concerts, or just to
sit around and talk with neighbors and friends.

Concerts. In Cincinnati, under the direction of
Robert E. Coady, Supervisor of Playgrounds, the
playgrotInds are rapidly becoming the summer
neighborhood meeting place, with particular em-
phasis placed on programs for adults after 5 :30
P. M. In cooperation with the Board of Park
Commissioners and the Federal Music Project,
band and orchestra concerts are given two or
three times a week on different grounds. On the
day of the concert available benches are delivered
to the playground by the Recreation Commission,
chairs are borrowed by some members of the
audience from houses in the vicinity, while others
bring their own boxes, stools, or folding chairs.

As you plan your summer program
ask yourself this question: "Are
our playgrounds serving adults?"

Dances. Social dances
are conducted in many
districts one, two, or three
nights a week by the
Playground Mothers

Clubs. Where WPA orchestras
are used admission is free;
where private orchestras are
employed the charge is two
dances for five cents. The
Playground Mothers Club,
with the playleader, assumes complete charge of
the dance, including employment of the orches-
tra, sale of refreshments, and chaperonage. Any
profits derived from the dances are used by the
clubs to purchase material for costumes, pay the
carfare of the children for inter-playground '
games, and for special treats for the children.
These dances are conducted especially for the
’teen age boy and girl, to give them a place where
they can dance in out of doors in pleasant sur-
roundings and with wholesome supervision at a
very small cost.

Everyone Helps! Other money-raising activities
conducted by the Playground Mothers Clubs with '
the assistance of the playleaders are carnivals,
festivals, and bake sales. Booths are erected by
the Recreation Commission, often with the help
of the men in the neighborhood. When these car-
nivals or festivals are held on Saturday, parents
and friends throng the grounds all afternoon and
evening, purchasing the articles for sale and par-
ticipating in the many progressive games of skill
which are placed at intervals on the playing field.
The men, particularly, take a sporting interest in
making a better score than their opponents.

Handcraft. In several locations “Ladies’ Night”
is celebrated once a week, with softball diamonds,
the wading pool, and other facilities reserved for
the exclusive use of girls and women. Some of
the community center handcrafts, knitting and
leather-tooling classes continue all summer, meet-
ing in the playground shelter building under the
covered shelter, or simply in a cool spot under
the trees. Last year one of the community center
photography classes met each week during the
summer at' the playground shelter building, the
members. traveling from there to one of the parks,

the conservatory, the Zoo, or some other interest-
ing place to take pictures and compare, discuss and
criticize photographs taken on previous trips.

Swimming. Cincinnati, unfortunately, is one of
the few large cities that does not have a publicly
owned swimming pool for adults, and in spite of
the many songs and poems written about the
“Beautiful Ohio,” it is not safe for swimming.
When one of the playleaders suggested a few
years ago that the children’s wading pools be kept
open at night for adults, no one believed that
grown men and women would want to try to swim
in pools having a maximum depth of three and a
half to four feet. The experiment was made,
however, and much to everyone’s amazement the
pools are crowded on hot nights with boys and
girls and men and women from sixteen to sixty
years of age. One or two large floodlights at-
tached to the shelter building outlets serve to il—
luminate the pools and the surrounding space. A
charge of five cents is made to cover the extra
service of caretaker and playleader, and in some
districts a small profit is realized.

Play Days. Community play days, with three or
four playgrounds in the district combining for a
celebration at the largest or most accessible area,
are another source of stimulating good fellowship
and better community spirit. Committees, with
representatives from each place, are formed to
assist the supervisor and
play leaders in organizing
the program. Wherever
possible the Federal
Music, Theater and
Vaudeville Projects are
enlisted to provide en—
tertainment.

Pageants. Two years
ago Cincinnati discon-
tinued the city—wide
playground pageant and
substituted a pageant on
each playground to
demonstrate to the par-
ents one part of the
playground program.
The pageants include
dancing, dramatics,
tumbling and singing,
and of course the par—
ents and relatives attend
to see little Johnny and

Mary perform, even if they are only members of
a large chorus. Many times the supervisors, stand—
ing on the sidelines, have heard remarks to the
effect that “I certainly had no idea the children
were doing anything like this,” or “I thought all
they did on the playground was swim and play
games.” The playground pageant, as well as the
handcraft and hobby exhibits can be excellent edu-
cational and publicity media for selling“ the play—

leaders.

On the Fourth of July. Independence Day, com—
ing so soon after the closing of school and the
opening of the summer playgrounds, can serve the
triple purpose of helping children to appreciate
the advantages given them by the Declaration of
Independence and the efforts of the great patriots
who made it possible for us to live in a de-
mocracy; to give them a joyous holiday without
the dangers of fireworks; and, through parades,
athletic events and short historical tableaux, to
bring large numbers of adults to the playground
early in the season, thereby creating an interest
which can be fostered throughout the summer. In
most neighborhoods the Playground Mothers Club
helps sponsor the Fourth of July celebration,
sometimes in cooperation with the local Welfare °
Association, by giving small
inexpensive prizes for the
best' costumes and win-
ners of athletic events,
and a treat, generally
ice cream and cake, to
every child participat—
ing in the parade and
program. In a similar
way, Labor Day can be
a fitting climax to the
season’s activities.

Co-Recreation. The
evening program, if
carefully conducted,
should provide a con-
structive social outlet
for the young men and
women in the neigh-
borhood. Often we have
found that a group of
young women playing

Travel Tours via Wishful Thinking!

LAYGROUND chil-
dren in Leomin-
ster, Massachu-

setts are going abroad
“via imagination,” and are having almost as much

fun with-their trips as if they were the real Mc-
Coy! Under the direction of Mrs. Mary Rocca
travel tours have been conducted to France, Italy,
Japan, England, Poland, and other foreign coun-
tries. How? It really is quite simple.

First, the children gather around in a circle to
start planning their trip to another distant land.
Paragraphs concerning the various countries are
read from a travel book to help in deciding what
shall be the next trip on their list. Comparisons
are made between our country and the foreign
ones. Transportation, food, dress, historical
features, and modes of. living are discussed. An
effort is made to answer all questions and to
obtain a clear picture of other countries.

In outlining their trip, the map of the country
is used to locate the important cities and rivers.
Parts of books are read about these places to pre-
sent a general picture of the country itself. Nat-
urally the group must carry along a dictionary of
the language used in each country visited, and in
this way members learn conversational expres-
sions in many foreign languages.

Next, the children get down to business with
time-tables, bus and
steamship pamphlets,
and plan in detail the
actual traveling involv-
ed. This gives them an
idea of What the trip
will cost, including rail-
road and steamship
fares, food, tips, sou-
venirs and similar ex-
penses. Each child has
his own expense book
in which he jots down
the sum agreed upon to
cover the whole trip.
After deciding definite-
ly on the date of de-
parture and the number
of stops en route they
are off—with the aid of

a map and a certain
amount of imagina-
tion!

As the trip pro-
gresses, the children spend their money, which is
carefully budgeted, and subtract it from the main
total, being careful to have enough for the return
trip. I

The good thing about a vicarious “crossing” is
that no one can possibly become seasick! Once
on the other side of the water, some time is spent
at each of the foreign cities on the list, and the
children learn for themselves the historical facts
of the country, noting the differences in customs,
food, and ways of living, and being very careful
to pay the exact amount for guide and taxi ser-
vice with the air of a connoisseur.

Stamps and souvenirs are often brought into
make the trip seem more real. Many times the
children draw pictures of some of the places, and
often they are taught to weave articles or to make
metal ornaments like those of foreign countries.
Once in a while some child has a relative or a
friend abroad and through this contact may be
able to add very interesting knowledge to the trip.

Upon returning home, each child tells about the
part of the trip he enjoyed most. The expense
books are checked and balanced, and a general
discussion follows which helps in planning the
next trip. Each trip be-
comes longer and more
interesting. The chil-
dren soon become well
enough acquainted with F
many countries to feel
quite at home in them.

cational and entertain-

There are many themes
which are adaptable for use
in the summer playground
program, and in them dra-
ma, music and handcraft
may all be introduced
in happy combination

 

"On Wings to Fairyland”

“ N WINGS TO F AIRYLAND” was the delight-
O ful theme on which the Playground and
Recreation Association of Wyoming'Val—
ley built last summer’s entire playground program,
with the exception of the athletic program which
was run separately. The idea of “On Wings to
Fairyland” was the feature, week by week, the
fairy tales of different lands, correlating the musi—
cal, dramatic, storytelling and handcraft activities
with the countries under discussion. The season
ended with a final pageant in Kirby Park bringing
together 3,000 children in the costumes repre-
sented by the fairy stories. .

The theme was unusually well chosen since it
was culturally worthwhile and at the same time
interesting, colorful, and adaptable to children of
all ages, especially to young ones. From the di-
rectors’ standpoint it was an
easy program to put on be-

Music: Get acquainted songs.

uThe Strong and the Brave"

An Indian playground pageant
given last summer in Reading,
Pennsylvania, by the Depart-
ment of Public Recreation

By CATHERINE HERB

Supervisor
Dramatics and Storytelling

chosen for the Reading playgrounds was that

of the Plains Indians. Two very helpful ad—
visors were William; “Lone Star” Dietz, foot—
ball coach at Albright College, a full—blooded
Sioux Indian, and Fred Cardin, Senior High
School music director and a Quapau Indian.
During the usual playground leaders’ insti-
tute both these men lectured on handicraft,
customs, music, dances and legends of the
Plains Indians. Most of the games, dances,
songs and handicraft learned there were later
incorporated into the final pageant. In this
way the pageant was merely an outgrowth
of the summer’s work.

The events of the pageant centered around
two orphaned, outcast children in the Pawnee
tribe—Ishnela, “Lonely Heart,” and Whean,
“Little Girl.” As is the custom among Indians,
wandering orphans remain outcasts because
the instinct of self-preservation is too great.
The children try to join in the games of the
small children, the tournaments of the older
boys, the work of the women and finally the
council of the men. There Ishnela hears that
the men are planning to attack a neighboring,
hostile tribe whose stealthy ways Ishnela
knows. He tries to interrupt their “War
Dance” and also their march toward the
enemy. Finally, in desperation, they all drive

him back to .the village, reaching safety just
as the hoots of the enemy are heard outside.
Because of Ishnela’s insistence and bravery,
which has saved them, the men decide to admit
him into the tribe, and to change his name.
Now follows the “Change—of-Name” ceremony
in which he is killed as his old self and revived
as his new self with'the new name “Chi-tan
Wa—lit,” the “Strong and the Brave.” After
the celebration he is given the honor of lead-
ing all the members of the tribe in a snake

dance which incidentally leads all of the per-
formers off the held.

Organization

After the third week of the playground
season, each leader was asked to give the num-
ber of boys and girls, ages 6—8, 9—12, 12-up,
the number ofvtomahawks, tepees, tom-toms,
and any oother particular talent which the
playground could provide. From these lists
were made the final assignments. Those who
could provide older boys were assigned the
parts of the braves; those who had more small
children were given the little girls’ games. _
As far as possible nearby playgrounds were
grouped together in the pageant, thus facili~

ln Step with the Playground Procession

" ALL ME EARLY, Mother
C dear,” the alert play-
ground director will
say this year, not because he is
to be Queen of the May, but
because the playground pro-
cession is almost under way
and it behooves him to be on hand to join the
lively marchers! So many splendid, colorful pro—
grams will be put on all over the country by re-
sourceful recreation directors and energetic play-
ground supervisors that we wish we could have a
roll call and beat the drum for each one. This
being impossible, we are jotting down a few of
the news items that have come our way about last
summer’s program. Some of them may prove
adaptable to your playground program, if you
haven’t already tried them.

Junior Fire Fighter Clubs. When the “clang
clang” of the fire bell is heard, where is the child
who does not run to follow the engine?

Four years ago Park Roberts, an Akron hre-
man, after careful study came to the conclusion
that fire prevention must be recognized as a prob—
lem demanding constant education and further
that it must be directed primarily at youth rather
than adults. Today there are 20,000 members en-
rolled in the Junior Fire Fighter Clubs in Akron,
Ohio. °

The activities of the program are varied. Radio,
dramatics, debates, demonstrations, lectures, and

The playground procession will
soon be on its ioyous way, skip-
ping and dancing through America
to the music of song and laugh-
ter. Won't your city ioin it?

motion pictures are all used in
the club program which has
been ad0pted as a part of the
curriculum in all elementary
schools of Akron with regular
firemen acting as instructors.
During the school term regu-
lar meetings are conducted on schedule once every
two weeks in each of the sixty elementary schools.
Specially made I6 mm. motion pictures accom-
panied by simple synchronized lectures on various
fire problems are the core of each meeting
program.

In the spring of 1937 the Akron Recreation
Commission suggested that the Junior Fire
Fighter Club program be incorporated in the sum-
mer playground program in order that the fire
prevention education might continue during the
summer and outdoor demonstrations be conducted
which would be impossible in the winter indoor
club program. A station wagon painted a fiery
red, completely equipped with loud speakers and
demonstratiOn equipment, each day all summer
long attracts club members and their friends to
several scheduled key playgrounds throughout the
city to take part in a demonstration dealing with
the chemistry of hre, proper extinguishing meth-
ods, first aid, and other allied subjects. There
were nfteen clubs last summer on the playgrounds,
and they were of unfailing interest.

A Whistling Contest. New York City whistlers
87

88 IN STEP WITH THE PLAYGROUND PROCESSION

There'll be music, and plays and
pageants, lantern parades, hikes
and picnics, and circuses as well

rallied round last summer when the Department
of Parks announced a whistling contest! The
contest was open to all types of whistlers, whether
finger or lip, and to two age groups, those under
eighteen and those over this age, with separate
divisions for boys and girls. The classifications
were: whistling soloists (classical, semi-classical
and popular songs), whistling novelties, and bird
imitators. Each contestant was required to par-
ticipate in the borough eliminations in order to be
eligible for the finals at Mullaly Playground. The
winner of each classification in the borough elimin
nations, from both age groups of the boys and
girls divisions, qualified for the city-wide compe-
tition. Persons prominent in the radio and whistl-
ing world acted as judges.

Venetian Nights in Oklahoma City. The an-
nual evening beach festival presented at Oklahoma
City is an event of color and beauty. For the past
two years the festival has been titled “Venetian
Nights.” As complete darkness settles upon Lin-
coln Park Lake, floodlights over the water and
beach are extinguished, and from one end of the
lake three long columns of lighted lanterns wend
their way towards the judges’ stand in the center
of the bathing beach. Small children carry their
lanterns along the beach; older boys and girls
form a column out in the water about knee deep.
Far out in the lake a motor boat pulls a train of
beautifully decorated lantern floats on boats in a
winding course about the lake.

Last year numerous lanterns were displayed on
a float near the center of the lake, and when the
parade was at its peak thousands of fireworks
when set off creating a beautiful background for
the spectacle. On the float was an accordion Vene-
. tian band producing lilting melodies which floated
back to the thousands of listeners along the shore
line. So successful has the beach festival been
for the past two years that it will be repeated this
summer; the theme this year will be Noah’s Ark.

Attractive Articles from Scrap Wood. Day-
ton, Ohio, playgrounds and community centers
find boys perennially interested in woodworking.
Several hundred prune boxes and orange crates

secured through the city relief bureau were con-
verted last year into over 6,000 articles. The fol-
lowing were some of the articles made: corner
shelves, book ends, wall brackets, tie holders, cor-
respondence files, sewing kits, towel racks, pipe
holders, ash trays. Each one of these articles was
made in several different models; tops in variety
were book ends and ash trays, numbering _twenty
models each.

Storytelling in Cincinnati. Storytelling hours
for the benefit of both children and adults were
made possible through the unselfish assistance of
the Cincinnati Story League. The storytellers
visited the play streets, hospitals, orphanages and
other institutions.

Hobo Day Picnic. The Hobo Day Picnic was
an outstanding feature of the special activities
promoted on the Davenport, Iowa, playgrounds
last summer. Children were encouraged to dOn
Mother’s andp Dad’s old clothes, -paint their faces,
bring their lunches and enjoy a full day at the
playground. Many picnic games, races and novel
events carrying out the Hobo Day theme proved
popular with the children.

Special Activities During Heat of the Day.
Realizing that harmful results could occur in
the promotion of strenuous activities during the

 

IN STEP WITH THE PLAYGROUND PROCESSION 89

heat of the day, Kansas City, Missouri, play—
grounds last summer placed emphasis on the fol-
lowing mid-day activities (in addition to dra-
matics, music, handcraft and nature study) : mar-
ble golf, clock golf, golf baseball, mumblety peg,
knife baseball, shufHeboard, O’Leary, tether ball,
horseshoes, stick bowling, checkers, marbles, do—
do boards, caddy, ring tennis, hand tennis, nine
man mill, loop tennis, box hockey, hop scotch,
’ homemade games, top spinning, story telling and
target pitching.

Wheel Day. Friday, July I, was W'heel Day on
all the Davenport, Iowa, playgrounds, last sum—
mer. Boys and girls had an opportunity to test
the speed of their scooters, wagons, kiddie cars,
bicycles, and anything else that ran on wheels.
Climaxing the local contests an inter-playground
wheel contest was held in which finalists in the
playground championships competed for city titles.
One of the most amusing races was the “used
tire” event in which boys eight years of age at-
tempted—in most cases successfully—to roll huge
tires over the finish line. Another of the more
exciting races was the cross country bicycle race.
Hazards were erected to check the speed of the
cyclists and a large crowd watched breathlessly
while the boys hurdled the barriers.

 

And there'll be athletic contests
and games, roller skating races,

handcraft and clubs of all kinds

Original Playground Songs. Playground chil—
dren of Salem, Massachusetts, turned poets last
summer and wrote playground songs which were
not only sung but used as accompaniments to
marching, and, in some cases, as themes for singing
games. The following tunes were chosen: The
Ranger’s Song, Columbia the Gem of the Ocean,
N otre Dame Alma Mater, If I Had One Wish to
Make, Heigh-Ho, I Love to Whistle, Happy Days
Are Here Again, Anchors Aweigh, Shipmates
Stand Together, Something About a Soldier, Stars
and Stripes March.

Baseball School. One of the features of last
summer’s city-wide program in a midwestern city
was a baseball school in which instruction was
given both in batting and fielding by some of the
city’s ace baseball men to midgets, juniors and
seniors. Seventy-five boys, chosen for their inter—
est and faithfulness in attending the school were
given a trip to Chicago, to be guests of the Chi—
cago Cubs. In spite of the fact that Old Man
Weather played his meanest trick by sending
enough rain that the game was called off, the boys
proclaimed it a great holiday and spent an inter-
esting half-day at the Brooklield Zoo.

Around the World in Sport. For Salt Lake
City’s children’s parade, (part of a city-wide cele-
bration), “Around the World in Sport” was
chosen as the theme. Each playground represented
at least one country and portrayed the sport most
typical of the country. The Spirit of fun and
drollery prevailed, and a steady roar of laughter
and applause greeted the frolicking youngsters as
they passed by.

Playground Caps and Other Handcraft Projects.
The making of playground caps was an original
and much liked feature of Salem’s last summer’s
handcraft program. It was fun for the children
to make the caps and it was fun for them to
wear them at the annual field day meet. Other
projects that were enthusiastically carried through
were: burlap belts of Tyrolean design; leather
chain purses, pocketbooks, pouches, billfolds and
wrist pocketbooks; doll needlecases (felt) ; Spool
knitting; bead work, table mats woven with jersey

loops. All of these articles were fairly inexpen-
sive to make.

The girls at several Chicago playgrounds made
in their art craft clubs little peasant aprons to be
kept in their playground lockers and worn at club
meetings.

Carnival Capers. August 13th was a far from
unlucky day for the children of Provo, Utah.
W eeks before this date hundredsyof busy fingers

had fashioned gay crepe paper into attractive fes-
toons and pompons. Large, life-like cardboard

animals, with a carnival air about them, had ap-
peared at the various play centers and fanciful
costumes bloomed like tulips. At 6:30 on August
I 3th, the parade went
into action. Led by boys
and girls of the Drum
and Bugle Corps, bears,
giraffes, trained ele-
phants and other strange
beasts dazzled the on-
lookers. Hundreds of
children appeared in
costume as Indians,
cowboys, freaks and
snake charmers. Eighty
Hoats were entered and
approximately 800 chil-
dren took part. After
the parade, twelve side
shows were opened at
North Park in the new-
ly lighted softball dia-
mond and a sixteen-act
Karnival “bigger than a show
and better than a circus” was
presented. .
Olympics in Webster County,

Iowa. At the first annual Webster County, Iowa, '

playground Olympics conducted last summer
under the sponsorship of the City Recreation
~Commission of Fort Dodge, events included pad-
dle tennis for men and women, checkers, tether
ball, chinning the bar, horseshoe pitching, soft-
ball throwing, and volleyball for men and women.
Each member of the winning and losing softball
and volley ball teams playing in the Olympics was
awarded a ribbon, the awards being made at the
playground jamboree which was the closing event
of the season. The cost of the yards of ribbon
badges totalled not over $5.00; thirty-one yards
of ribbon were used and were typed by members
of the staff instead of being printed commer-

cially. This summer it is planned to add Chinese
checkers, tennis, croquet, and swimming to the

list of Olympic events.
Step-by—Step Development of Dramatics. Plau-

dits to Salem, Massachusetts for its very reason-
able approach to the treatment of playground
dramatics! The first week saw dramatics in its
most rudimentary form, the pantomiming of sim-
ple scenes familiar to‘the children, such as scenes

in a doctor’s office, a bus or a store. The next A

week, the director chose a simple story and guided
the children in its pantomimic presentation in
three scenes. The following week, the children
themselves chose the story and pantomimed it
with the help of the in—
structor. The next“ step
was the introduction of
dialogue and by the lat-
ter part of the season
the children were writ-
ing and acting their own
plays. The last two
weeks were given over
to preparing for and
staging a play on each
of the playgrounds.
These plays were adapt—
ed from well-known
tales, such as Hansel
and Gretel, Tom Saw-
yer, Alice in Wonder-
land, Red Riding Hood,
and The Three Bears.

Theater Trailer Unit.
A theater trailer unit decorated in
circus fashion was in constant
use in the Akron, Ohio, play-
ground dramatic program all
summer. Equipped with sound, lights, scenery
and piano, the unit was scheduled on playgrounds
for one or two days at a time. The marionette
plays, part of the program, attracted especial at-
tention and interest.

Playground Booster Clubs. St. Paul, Minne-
sota, has playground booster clubs similar to
Parent-Teacher organizations connected with the
schools. The chief function of the clubs, which
meet monthly, is to help the Playground Bureau

to provide the necessary materials for their re- A ,

spective community centers. The majority of such
clubs have furnished pianos, chairs, tables, and
dishes for their centers. The clubs also assist or-

Dramatics for the Camp Community

ETWEEN the produc-
B tion by the director

of “regular” plays
and the creation by the
children of their own productions
there is an intermediate stage in which
the campers\ may take the initiative,
but which is more or less impromptu,
so that it does not require so much time for plan-
ning and rehearsal. These brief performances
may take the form of “stunts,” in which case they
are played in a humorous manner, or they may
have the dignity of amateur dramatic tourneys.

The result will depend upon the spirit in which~

the plan is first presented to the children. A great
deal depends upon the tact and the enthusiasm of
the director.

One day we announced a contest between
groups of campers to take place that very night.
The problem was for each group to take a ballad
or a story-poem‘ and arrange it in any dramatic
form that seemed most interesting. We submitted
a list of poems for them to choose from, but sev-
eral groups thought of better ones, and we, with
“hands off,” waited eagerly for the evening’s
performances.

At the performance, what amazed us most was
the high imaginative level of the whole affair,
though the groups had been made up arbitrarily,
not divided according to ability. Some of the
younger children did good work with nursery
rhymes; there was the usual “Young Lochinvar,”
unusually well done, and a version of “There
\N ere Three Gypsies” acted in pantomime to the
singing of the poem. Best of all was a perform-
ance of one of A. A. Milne’s

the imaginative spirit
which sometimes finds its
best release in self-expres-
sion through informal dra-
matic activity. After that we discov-
ered even more possibilities in Mr.
Milne. “The King’s Breakfast” is
particularly rich in pantomimic pos-
sibilities, and, although I have never tried, per-
haps the Pooh books.

Source Material

The dramatics counselor should certainly own
a good book of storytelling ballads, such as Vir-
ginia Olcott’s Storytelling Poems. The Robin
Hood ballads are useful for groups not too old to
feel sophisticated about them. (Naturally these
appeal more to boys than to girls.) “King John
and the Abbot of Canterbury,” “King Robert of
Sicily,” “The Highwayman,” “Young Lochinvar,”
are all good ballads which dramatize well. They
may be used for performances like these or as the
basis for a real “created” play. Mother Goose
rhymes are a fertile source, of course, and any
story-songs, such as “There Were Three Gypsies,”
or the delightful French folk song, “Malbrough,”
as well as less literary efforts such as “Frankie
and Johnnie” (a mild version) or the nonsense
“backwards tale” which begins: “A long time to
come, I remember it well.”

When there is not time for the children to plan
and “make” it, the counselor can often adapt a
simple story by combining a group of old English
songs, or songs of several countries. If these are
folk songs already familiar to the group, they can

be used effectively with sim-

delightful poems, “King
John’s Christmas” from N ow
We Are Six. This was some-
thing we counselors had nei-
ther suggested nor expected,
.and it was really thrilling to
.see what those girls of high
school age made of it. The
India Rubber Ball remains in
my memory as one of the
funniest and most convincing
“characterizations” I ever
.saw. It was a real triumph of

and in which little opportunity was

ple pantomime and dance.
Another useful idea is to
take excerpts from certain '
well-known material like
Shakespeare’s comedies. We
have often used the “Pyra-
mus and Thisbe” episode
from the rustic scenes in “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
sometimes in pantomime, ac-
companied by the reading of
the scene, sometimes with the
characters speaking their own

91

parts. It always seems to go over well, and is not
very hard to do. The fairy scenes from the same
play prove to be good material when cut or pan—
tomimed. There are also scenes from “Twelfth
Night” and “The Merchant of Venice” that may
be done in the same manner. I have seen a high
school girl pantomime the Launcelot Gobbo scene
beginning “Certainly my conscience will serve me
to run,” with the most delightful effect.

Of course if the children have time to learn
lines and take part in a number of rehearsals, all
the better, and if you have the opportunity to pro-
duce a whole Shakespearean play, such as “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” what better place
could you have than the naturally beautiful set-
tings of the out of doors? If this kind of cutting
seems sacrilege to you, then I shouldn’t do it, but
personally I think Shakespeare wouldn’t mind a
bit! I have seen dramatizations by children made
from the Lamb stories of these plays, with songs
and some speeches taken from the plays them—
selves. They seemed to me a very delightful in-
troduction to the richness of the Shakespearean
study which would come with their high school
and college days. Of course what holds good for
Shakespearean plays also holds good for certain
other dramatists in the annals of English, Ameri—
can and even foreign—language literatures. There
are no royalties on any but the more modern
“Classics,” and if the cutting is done with rever—
ence it would seem to be in the good interest of
all theaters to give children a chance at doing
plays that have stood the test of time.

In the list of “creative materials” are included
many simple fairy and folk tales, fables and
myths. Sometimes the younger children will avail
themselves of this material to make a play, even
when there is no place on the camp program for a
group in experimental or creative dramatics. I
remember once being asked to attend a production
(“show,” I suspect they called it) in the shack of
some of the youngest girls in our camp. I was
both amazed and delighted to witness a very effec-
tive production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” drama-
tized, acted and well directed by these nine and
ten year olds, without benefit of counselor. No—
body had known what they were up to, and their
pride in this achievement was delightful to be-
hold. It made me wish there were more time in
that camp for the development of such originality.
One should watch for spontaneous productions
of that sort and encourage them quietly without
nipping them in the bud with What the young im-

presarios would doubtless regard as uncalled—for

interference on the part of grown—ups! _
Well-known stories like “Little Black Sambo,”

“The Three Bears,” “Ali Baba and the Forty
Thieves,” and “The Three Wishes,” may be acted
more or less spontaneously, either in pantomime
while someone else tells the story, or by combining
this scheme with some spoken dialogue. Of course
these, along with the more elaborate fairy and folk
tales, may also be used for more complete and
finished dramatizations.

One word of warning concerns the possibility
of over—use of the most familiar stories. Try to
help the children recollect or discover stories less
often used for dramatic material. A judicious use
of the others is all right, but if the children con—
tinuously follow the path of least resistance in this
way a situation may arise as ludicrous as that now
existing among new puppeteering groups, where it
has almost come to be necessary that “Hansel and
Gretel” is produced as the first play of every
group!

“Operas”

‘At one camp we had a girl about fifteen years
old who loved to give impromptu versions of
what; she called “operas,” but who could never
make a success of them when she was asked to
elaborate them in the recreation hall for the whole
camp group. They were most entertaining per-
formances, however, if you could catch a pro-
duction on the wing and be swept along by the
enthusiasm and personality of the young impre-
sario. These “operas” were largely a hodge—
podge of the stories of the various operas she had
seen or read about, with the rest being “made up”
as they went along, and with the pantomime and

songs impromptu. The result was quite colorful ply

and very funny.

This kind of activity is useful in developing :

originality and spontaneity. It should be en—
couraged, or even casually suggested by the dra-
matics counselor, if she thinks there is any latent

or budding originality in camp. The interest of v

the other campers permitted to participate or to

watch her performances never failed to manifest I

itself enthusiastically, and we came to feel that
they had more real dramatic value for our chil-
dren than many of the more elaborate productions
at the recreation hall.

This girl, incidentally, was a very good charac- I

ter actress if she could be caught out of one of
her “moods”; she learned quickly and worked

 

 

 

DRAMATICS FOR THE CAMP COMMUNITY 93

Where life is all drama as
the campers relive the ex-
citing adventures they have
ius’r had and make new plans

hard at rehearsals. With
a little time and some
skillful handling on the
part of the dramatics
counselor, spontaneous
productions like these
“operas” might be made
over into more finished
performances.

While we are on the
subject of operas, I
might mention that cer-
tain scenes from Gilbert
and Sullivan are excel-
lent material for short
dramatic episodes. The
“Willow; Tit Willow”
scene from “The Mi~
kado,” for instance, with Ko-Ko and Katisha, is
always fun. If you have a copy of Light Opera:
the Whole PVorld Sings, you will 19nd more than
enough material ready to hand, particularly if
there is a volume of Gilbert’s texts at hand. Ex-
cerpts from Humperdinck’s “Hansel and Gretel”
are effective and easy to do. Of course, this de-
lightful little opera is often given by the children
in its simplified form in its entirety.

Naturally, you need a good pianist for this kind
of work, but you need her anyway! Once I didn’t
have one for the whole summer (or even a piano),
and I had to substitute my own voice and the
guitar as accompaniment for my own attempts at
pantomime and for my colleague’s dancing classes.
We managed—but if you can get them by hook
or by crook, do have a piano and somebody who
can play it! No other equipment is more neces-
sary to a camp dramatics director.

Pageants and Rituals

Often the dramatics counselor is called upon
for the production—and sometimes for the writ-
ing and planning—of pageantry or ritual for vari-
ous special occasions. If these occasions are tra-
ditional, you will simply have to adapt yourself
to circumstances and do your best to enter into

the spirit of the group who cherishes them. If the
occasion is a new one for celebration, you will
probably have to make the script yourself.

One such production used many times in our
camp was an adaptation for pantomime and dance,
played to the accompaniment of music, and with
a preliminary reading of the story, “Le Jongleur
de Notra Dame.” This is a legendary French
medieval tale which has an operatic version, and
which Anatole France has written beautifully in
short story form. The version we use is my own,
adapted for our special needs. It has become part
of the tradition of the camp and is given on a
special Sunday once every summer.

There are many other religious, semi-religious,
Biblical, or legendary tales which can be used in
the same way. The Ruth and Naomi story, ar-
ranged for pantomimic production accompanied
by reading, in Ritual and Dramatized Folkways,
Jasspon and Becker, is another excellent example
of what can be effectively done with this type of
material. You will need only a few rehearsals,
except for special small groups, and if the setting
is right and the atmosphere simple and sincere,
you will nnd that you have done a very appealing
piece of work.

94 . DRAMATICS FOR THE CAMP COMMUNITY

Pantomimes, Too
Very lovely pantomimes accompanied by music
. can be easily arranged from the more dramatic
star myths, either the Greek and Roman tales, the
Chinese and East Indian myths, or the legends as
told among the Red Men of North America. The
Greek story of the Great and Little Bears is one
such legend that lends itself well to damatization,
and the story of the Lyre, which is really that of
Orpheus and Eurydice, is equally effective. If
there is a teacher of rhythmic dancing in the
camp, you will probably find it more satisfactory
to get her to work the story out in dance drama
form, unless you decide to collaborate and make a
real dancemime of the production.

For example: in dramatizing the Greek legend
of Lyra, the first scene pictures Orpheus, with his
lyre, weeping over the grave of Eurydice and re-
fusing to be comforted by his friends, the nymphs,
until one of them suggests that he go to Hades
to seek her. '

The second scene presents his meeting with the
Furies and how even they give way before the
wonderful power of his music. In the third scene,
he pleads before Pluto and Proserpine and his
music is so moving that he is allowed to take Eury-
dice back to the regions of earth, provided that
he does not look at her until they have reached
the upper air. When he is unable to resist the
temptation, she is carried back to Hades by the
Furies; Orpheus drops his lyre and goes away in
a frenzy of grief: Jupiter comes and lifts the lyre
to set it among the stars, where it becomes our
constellation, Lyra.

In this last scene, which can be continuous from
the time Orpheus meets the Furies, or from the
time he presents himself before Pluto, as soon as
Jupiter disappears with the lyre, a group of girls,
dressed in flowing robes and carrying torches,
enter and form the shape of, Lyra on the hillside,
as the appropriate ending for the story. We have
used this legend several times in our camp, as it
is a great' favorite with the children. The Furies,
in particular, enjoy themselves. Such productions
are splendid examples of the fusion of several
self-expressive art forms—-here of pantomime,
dance, music, and poetry, as we had a specially
written prologue read as an introduction to one
production of this star legend.

Simply costumed with Greek robes and tunics,
these little pantomimes, especially if done out of
doors on a moonlight night, take on a quality of
delicate solemnity and ritual-like beauty. The

nature counselor may tell the story beforehand,
even if it is well known to the entire audience, or
a clever poet may arrange it in simple rhythmic
verse and have it read as a prologue to the action
(see paragraph above).

A Few General Suggestions

For reading of this kind, a warm, clear, sympa-
thetic voice is desirable. Often such voices, sur-f
prising in their richness, may be found among}
both counselors and campers who are not inter-i
ested in acting but who can give much pleasure by}
contributing their talent in this way. Music, too,,
is always a desirable accompaniment to the action,
of a star legend, whether or not there is speaking,
A good pianist can arrange a selected score from}

effect, if the sound is arranged to come through
the loud speaker of a radio. i

A word about the settings for camp productions,
may not be amiss here. Since this article is not;
intended for dramatic directors who are working;
where there is a regular auditorium or even all
stage, it is not necessary to go into the designing
and making of stage sets. One of the chief charms!
of camp dramatic productions is the flexibility
both“ necessary and desirable in the planning of'
the season’s productions. It is good training for
both actors and audience, for director and scene
designer, to make use of as many different places
in the camp environment as possible, for the vari-:
ous plays, pageants and dance dramas. If the cli-
mate permits, the outdoor environment should be
used frequently, at least for pantomimes, dances,
pageants, and plays which require many actors
and not much talking. Even the speaking out of
doors, so often an obstacle when untrained voices
must try to adapt themselves to the larger tones?
that are necessary for good audibility, is not so-
hard to manage in camp, where the audience is‘;
comparatively small and may be closer to the act-.
ing area than in a regular amphitheater or stai-
dium. Most children with normal speaking voices
can be taught to project their tones effectively
even in a large stadium, but we are presupposing
limited time for teaching by the director of camp, ~_

With the Day Camps of Pittsburgh

By LOUIS C. SCHROEDER
Superintendent

Bureau of Recreation

sylvania, was launched by the Federation of

Social Agencies in 1933. Since 1937 the Bureau
of Recreation has assumed complete direction of
the city’s day camps, the Federation of Social
Agencies lending its aid in times of need. The
purpose of the founders was similar to the ob-
jective sought by other cities with similar proj-
ects, namely: to give the so-called underprivileged
and malnourished children an opportunity to en—
joy the benefits of a camping experience. This
means a contact with nature, an inviting daily
program of. activities under trained leadership,
and a supply of carefully selected, nourishing

food.

THE DAY CAMP movement in Pittsburgh, Penn-

Purpose. The day camps are primarily for chil-
dren whose ages range from eight to thirteen
years. The selection of campers during past years
has been made by case workers of the Federation
of Social Agencies. A new plan will be adopted
this year when the selection will be made of chil—
dren who are on the public and parochial school
milk list. School nurses who serve both schools
and the City Department of Health will, in 1939,
do the choosing.

Medical Examination. All prospective campers
must pass a strict medical examination by the
city doctors. Those having physical and organic
defects are not accepted. These examinations are
held on Fridays in the public schools or recreation
centers in the districts in which the campers re-
side. A pass is given to each child who has been
accepted, and this serves as his identification card.
The case workers and the camp counselor assist
the doctors in the recording of results. Approxi-
mately 600 to 700 children are examined weekly.

Camp Sites. Pittsburgh is indeed very fortu-
nate in having large, beautiful parks easily acces-
sible within its corporate limits. The six that have
been used in the past two years—Schenley, Frick,

experience many a day camper may enjoy

Riverview, Highland, McKinley, and McBride—-
have splendid camping facilities. The Bureau of
Parks designates certain sites for the day camps,
thus insuring protection and privacy. These have
shelters and open fireplaces.

Transportation. The children are taken from
their home districts to the city parks by special
chartered trolley car. They gather at nine o’clock
each morning—Monday to Friday inclusive—at
a designated street corner, where they board the
trolley cars. The camp counselors assume charge,
and accompany the children at all times. The
children are carefully counted as they board the
cars, and again at their destination. The “buddy
plan” is used, and by this method a careful check
can be made. The arrangement With the trans-
portation company calls for movement after rush
hours in the morning, and the return trip to their

95

96 WITH THE DAY CAMPS OF PITTSBURGH

home areas before the rush hour in the evening.
The plan is altered for Friday evening when a
special camp fire program is held. The children
leave the parks on this night about eight-thirty
o’clock. One trolley car is employed for each day
camp site, and the load is varied from 75 to 125

children.

Personnel. The day camp personnel consists of
a camp director, an assistant camp director, six
head counselors, twelve junior counselors, and
volunteers. The directors and counselors are
under the Civil Service Commission. Theoretical
examinations are held each spring, and the suc—
cessful candidates are chosen from the list. T he
personnel of each of the six day camps operated
in 1938 called for one head counselor, two junior
counselors (I male and I female), and a number

of volunteers.

Matters relating to food are handled by a dieti-
tian who is under contract to supply meals. She
has a corps of workers to assist in the handling
of food. The daily luncheons are transported by
auto to the camp sites.

All administrative matters are taken. care of by
the office of the Bureau of Recreation.

Training Institutes are held weekly throughout
the camping season for all members of the ac-

tivity staff.

Meals. Since the camps are made up of children
who are malnourished, special consideration is
given to the question of the noon day meals. Each
child is given a half pint bottle of frbsh milk with
the meal and again at three o’clock. A sample
weekly menu consisted of the following:

Monday
Ham Salad Sandwich
Jelly Sandwich on cracked

Tuesday
Vegetable Salad
Cheese and Pickles

Friday (Supper) °
Baked Beans
Apple Sauce

Friday (Lunch)
Egg Salad Sandwich-
Jelly Sandwich on

cracked wheat bread Roll
Milk Milk
Fruit Fruit

Thursday is the day for the “cook-out,” when
children, under the direction of the counselors,
prepare their own meals.

The Activities Program. The program of activi-
ties for a day camp composed of malnourished
children needs be different from the camp having
normal children. A lesser attention needs be paid
to the more vigorous games and sports. Mal-
nourished children do need a mild form of daily
exercise, but one must not lose sight of the fact
that they are sent to the day camp primarily to
build up reserve power. So all forms of strenuous
competitive activities are taboo. The program of
physical activities consists of regulated hikes, folk
dances and singing games, circle and ball games,
and other types which do not tax the organism.

The program of activities is in no way re-
stricted. In addition to the physical recreation
program, others are offered, such as handicrafts,
drama, music, and nature study.

The handicraft program has been particularly
stressed. Every attempt is made to use material
around the camp site. Frequently pottery is made
from clay discovered near the camp. All kinds of
articles are fashioned out of wood, and arrow
heads are formed out of soft stone. The Bureau
of Recreation supplies a limited amount of ma-
terial such as unbleached muslin, paper, cord, soda
straws, and oilcloth. Indian lore proves most
popular, and many are the articles made by chil-
dren, including tom-toms, head-dress, tomahawks,
and gourds. '

A Modern Playground

No Man's Land

OUNDED ON ONE side by railroad tracks and on
B the other two sides with steep hillsides, a tri-
angular tract of bleak lowland owned by the

City of Cleveland lay deserted and forgotten for
many years. It served no purpose. Today the sec—

men are busy with trucks, excavating machinery
and picks and shovels remaking the terrain. The
ground has been leveled, trees planted, the course
of a creek straightened, two hills of shale re-
moved; in fact the area is hardly recognizable as

the old location. In an-
other few months will
emerge one of the largest
and most extensive rec-
reational areas in north-
ern Ohio.

Known as Brookside
Park No. 2, the area is
situated adjacent to the
Brookside Zoological
Gardens on the south-
west side of Cleveland, a
few miles from the cen-
ter of the city. Few rec-
reational facilities are available in this section of
the city and the completion of the playground will
provide a needed safety valve. The development
of Brookside No. 2 is just one part of the major
recreational building program undertaken by the
city. The scope of this playfleld is so great, how-
ever, and the facilities so comprehensive, that it
stands out as the most important recreational de-
velopment in Cleveland in several decades.

The selection of the site is a fortunate one for
large crowds are drawn to this section of the city
by the zoo. Formerly some recreational facilities
were “provided in the area adjacent to the zoo
grounds. These consisted of ball diamonds, ten-
nis courts, a swimming pool and picnic grounds.
The land occupied by these facilities will be used
for expanding the zoological buildings”; all athletic
activities will be moved to the new development.

A portion of Brookside No. 2 was one of the
old city nurseries. For years it had been neglected
and unused. At the recommendation of Parks
Director Hugo E. Varga, Mayor Burton author-
ized in 1937 a large WPA park and recreation

97

98 A MODERN PLAYGROUND IN NO MAN’S LAND

program to rehabilitate and “streamline” the park
and recreational facilities of Cleveland which have
fallen short of modern requirements during the
last decade or more. In 1937 Mr. Gordon Cooper

was commissioned to prepare general landscape
architectural plans for this fifty-four acre tract of

land, formerly used as a city nursery. Ideally
located and of about the right size, it was decided
to construct an athletic held that wouldnbe second
to none in the country. A W'PA project employ-
ing over 4,000 men at one time was approved, and
work began in the early part of 1938. Total cost
of labor and materials being used in construction
is estimated at approximately $2,000,000.

The first major task in renovating the territory
was to straighten and confine Big Creek which
Winds through the center of the area. Stone em-
bankments were built and a 32-foot hard surfaced
road constructed along the stream. For a distance
of one-half mile the road and a walk, ten feet
wide, border the creek, providing a pleasant and
attractive thoroughfare through the park and
playgrounds.

Five distinct divisions of recreational facilities
are being built. These include a regulation foot-
ball held with a quarter mile running track around
it. Eight baseball diamonds, hve large ones for
hardball and three small fields for softball, have
been laid out. Eleven hard surfaced tennis courts
and several picnic areas in secluded spots are
almost ready. A large swimming pool and a
smaller diving pool are in process of construction.
In addition, a large and adequately landscaped
bath house will be built at the north end of the
swimming pool.

The large swimming pool will be 200 feet long
and 50 meters wide, the regulation width for
Olympic swimming events. The diving pool, lo-
cated at the north end of the swimming pool, will
also be 50 meters wide, but only 40 feet in length.
A IO—meter diving tower is planned as well as
several three-meter and one-meter diving boards
for all types of diving competition. Permanent
seats of eight tiers will be built on the east, south
and west sides of the diving pool for spectators;

those on the east side will also be available for
bathers.

At the north end of the pool is the large bath
house with showers, locker facilities and equip-
ment for filtration and chlorination of. the pool
water. Four small buildings of identical archi-
tecture will be located at each corner of the pool,

one for athletic field equipment, one for equip-
ment and control of the tennis courts, a rest room
and a shelter house. Athletic held, pools and ten-
nis courts lay side by side. This plan permits the
use of buildings surrounding the pools to be used
for all three activities. Bleachers are also being
built on the west side of the athletic field for

spectators.

South of the tennis courts is an area set aside
for children’s apparatus, swings, sand boxes, a-
shower basin, see-saws and similar equipment will i
be placed here.

Two large parking spaces, to accommodate ap- ‘
proximately 450 cars each, are located near each
entrance to the area. A foot bridge over Big
Creek connects the north and south sections. Just
south of the swimming pools is a picnic area. It
will be equipped with stakes for pitching horse-
shoes, picnic tables and seats and outdoor lire-
places.

Just north of the railroad tracks which form
the northern boundary to Brookside Park No. 2,
and close to one of the entrance drives is Cleve-
land’s city-owned amateur baseball stadium. Fitted
with lights for night games, the stadium was first
used at night last summer. A record crowd of
100,000 persons attended the opening game and
throughout the season thousands of Clevelanders
visited the stadium to witness amateur games.
Although not an integral part of Brookside N o. 2,
the stadium is .near enough to be included in the
recreation held. Tiers of concrete seats have been
in existence at this location for almost twenty
years, but as part of the renovating .of this base-
ball stadium two additional tiers on each side of
the original will soon be constructed. When tin-
ished it will be among the largest and best equipped -‘
athletic helds in the country.

On a bluff overlooking and to the east of the F
area, an animal house with large runs is being I
built. Other buildings are being erected in the
zoological gardens and when completed will serve
to make Brookside Park a well balanced unit. A -
few minutes walk from any spot, will enable one
to reach any of the facilities for all popular sports, _
the zoo, picnic grounds, the large baseball stadium -
or walks and wooded areas.

With the modernization of Cleveland’s recrea-
tional areas and with the deve10pment of Brook-
side Park No. 2, as well as some other large
athletic areas, Cleveland has decidedly taken a
great step in advance.

 

HE ARTS AND CRAFTS of our forefathers, if
Tthey are known and appreciated, express the

urge to create something beautiful out of the
materials at hand and to fill the commonplace
needs of everyday living. This urge is the
inner spirit of man that has found expression
through the ages and has given him a place
above the animals. What is there which gives
us more faithful records of the history of man
than his works of art? Cities may fall, dates
and heroes may be forgotten, but the creative
expressions live. Primitive man and the Indian
worked with materials of their native habitat.
They made things of beauty and necessity for
everyday comfort.

Knowing that summer days are ahead and
that lively boys and girls Will be crowding our
playgrounds and recreation centers in a few
weeks, we are confronted with the problem:
What can we use for materials? Why should
we use them? How can we make them func-
:ion in our recreation program?

In ,order to find the answers to these ques-
:ions, approximately one hundred men and
women of_ Westchester County met for a six
Neeks’ course during March and April at the
County Center \Vorkshop in White Plains,
\Tcw York. The opening meeting found them
:ager to discuss what was meant by using

materials with very little expense. Some
people call these materials junk or rubbish, but
we feel that bits of discarded materials, a few
simple tools, and a happy, creative child take
such experiences out of the “tin can” class.
By adding local material, such as seeds.
shells, dried weeds, pits, drift wood and many
others, we have very good media for excellent
experiences and experiments. The experience
is of far greater importance in the development
of the child than the finished product and
should be gauged to the ability of the child.

“What Can We Use for Materials?”

This question was most interestingly an-
swered in Westchester County by exhibitions
each week of work done by leaders and
children, as well as by experiments done in the
class. The idea of sharing with children as
well as with adults was found to be a basic
factor in the creative life. If more material
than one could use in‘his own work was at the
disposal of a member of the group, he was glad

Campaigning For industrial Salvage

N 1932-33, the Flint, Michi-
I gan, schools found them-

selves financially embarras-
sed because of a fifteen mill tax
limitation which cut school rev-
enues to nearly one half of what they had previ-
ously been. This forced all departments to make
_ decided cuts in school budgets and reduced so
drastically supply budgets in the industrial arts
department that the teachers of this subject had
to resort to collecting materials from salvage
dumps about the city. Realizing that industries
had salvage which might be used, some of the
teachers recommended that contacts be made with
all the city’s industrial plants to learn whether this
material might not be used in the shops.

The Chamber of Commerce undertook respon-
sibility for making the contacts, and the manager,
Mr. John Routzen, wrote letters to the heads of
all Flint industries, thus paving the way for our
approach to them. The officials of the companies
with whom we talked were cordial and sympa-
thetic, and immediately began saving material for
us.

The next step involved making arrangements
for a Board of Education truck to collect the ma—
terial from industries on regular schedules. So
much material was given the schools that it be-
came necessary at once to provide storage space.

greatly interested in the pro-
gram, arranged for a former
coal shed 80’ x 30’ belonging to
the Board of Education to be turned over for the
use of the project. All materials are now collected
and sorted in this building, and all deliveries made
from it. Two men are employed by WPA to sort
and distribute materials to the shops through sal-
vage requisition blanks which are turned in by the
industrial arts teachers.

When the program was first organized the Flint -
Board of Education truck was used, but this was
found to be expensive so the work is now being
done by a truck from the Mott Foundation with
no cost to the Board of Education except for gas~
oline and oil. This arrangement was made by a
business man who is vitally interested in securing
salvage for the schools.

All School Departments Benefit

Other school departments are now making use
of this service. For example, the elementary
grades use orange crates and salvage pattern pine
for some of their work. The physics department
uses the old radios for their radio instruction, and
the art department utilizes the salvaged leather in

This Year lt's Boston

YesI This Year It's Boston —-
October 9-I3!

OSTON, the home of Joseph
B Lee, the scene of some of

the earliest beginnings of
the recreation movement, will
welcome the Twenty-Fourth
Annual Recreation Congress
during its sessions to be held at
the Statler Hotel, October 9 - I 3.

To Joseph Lee, as perhaps to none other, goes
the credit for the fact that the recreation move-
ment has grown so remarkably for more than
thirty years, and that this is the Twenty-Fourth
Annual Recreation Congress. A movement that
can continue to bring people together in Congress
from all parts of the country for so many years
has something of unusual vitality and has strUCk
its roots deep in the life of the nation.

Let us take a look at the Congress which last
year brought together over 1,400 persons from all
parts of the United States and from Canada. You
might think that a Recreation Congress set up by
the National Recreation Association was intended
for public recreation workers only. Far from it.
There are hundreds of delegates from private or—
ganizations of all kinds. People from gardening
clubs, representatives of industries, educators,
legislators, housing authorities, hospitals, life in-
surance companies, churches, libraries and social
work councils, social agencies, governments, all
are there to learn and to share their experience in
recreation. Editors, students, manufacturers and
distributors of materials used in recreation and
leisure, planning consultants, landscape architects,
extension agents of State Universities, leaders in
camping, in 4-H Clubs and Future Farmers of
America, youth groups, all share in the discussion
and enjoy the fellowship of the great gathering.

\Vhat do they do, you ask? Well, while they
come from many walks of life, and while they
differ in race, creed and politics, they come with
one dominant interest—to learn how they can do
a better recreation ob in their communities. They
listen to the best inspirational speakers that can
be secured. They attend group conferences where
under able leadership they discuss the most im-
portant recreation problems that community lead-
ers face today. They hear people from other cities

It is fitting that the Recreation
Congress should be going back to
Boston this year. It will be like a
return to a cherished shrine. The
memories of Joseph Lee will inspire
and enrich its deliberations. His
home and the scene of his early ef-
forts to provide playgrounds for the
children will be of interest to all.

than their own tell of successful
experiences and profit by the
hearing. They tell their own ex-
periences for the benefit of all.
They also learn of the relation-
ships of the various parts of the
great national movement the ex—
perience of which is pooled and
made available through the Na-
tional Recreation Association to any recreation
workers who want- such information.

When the discussions are over, there are demon-
strations of puppets, special moving pictures, a
splendid array of recreation equipment on display
and a special room where people may arrange ap-
pointments with the specialists in all phases of
recreation work. Last year 684 interviews were
arranged besides the many, many conversations
that occurred in the hotel lobby, the corridors or
in private rooms. A splendid display of the latest
and best books on recreation will be there. A large
exhibit of printed matter gathered from all parts
of the country will be available for inspection.

One night is dedicated to fun—Play Night—
when dancing, square and formal, is enjoyed by
the delegates.

A large grOUp of Board members are in the
Congress each year and they will have special con-
ferences where their particular problems will be
discussed. And they do enjoy getting together
when there are no professionals around!

The recreation movement is really a laymen’s
movement. It was started by laymen, and its
policy making groups today are solid lay citizens.
N o more important or helpful group will be found
in the Congress.

One simply cannot describe the genial fellow-
ship that is found all during the days of the Con-
gress. Bill Jones of Rhode Island meets Sam
Smith of Texas to swap yarns about common
knotty problems. Daisy Dean meets Sarah Swift
to talk about work for women and girls on social
recreation. Meeting new friends, renewing ac-
quaintances and pumping old timers is a part of
the joy of the Congress.

Much is being said these days about democracy.
Well, the Twenty-Fourth Recreation Congress
will have something to say about democracy too, if

twenty-four cents went for fishing tackle. The
major reason for the current increase in interest
in this sport, according to Time, is a vogue for
deep sea angling, increasingly popular in the past
five years since it has been dramatized in
news reels and publicized by such fishermen as

Zane Grey, Ernest Hemingway, and President
Roosevelt.

American Anglers Have
a Busy Year

FOR SEVERAL years the
Wisconsin Conserva-
tion Department has
conducted an extensive
winter bird feeding ground, and this year $1 1,410
was set aside for snowy weather dinners for
pheasants, partridges, grouse, and prairie chicken.
Each of W isconsin’s seventy-one counties re—
ceived a basic dollar allotment arrived at through
relating the number of birds stocked to the num-
ber packed in 1938. From 200 to 2 50 tons of grain
were used for feeding. To assist cooperating
schools, sportsmen, and civic groups, the Conser—

ON MARCH 14th and
I 5th the fifth annual
one-act play tourna— ‘
ment conducted by the
Drama Advisory Council of the Public Recreation
Commission of Cincinnati, Ohio, was held. Since .
its introduction five years ago the tournament idea
has grown in popularity with the result that many
groups including church organizations have held
their own tournaments. Following the contest one
play was broadcast over station WCKY.

Judging was done on the following basis: 50
per cent for presentation covering casting, light-
ing, costumes, make-up, the tone, spirit and
smoothness of the performance and the degree of
success attained in conveying the idea of the play
to the-audience; for acting, meaning aggregate in-
dividual interpretation, technique, speech and
voice, 30 per cent was given; for the selection of
play, dramatic qualities, appropriateness of the
group presenting it, and value of the play, 20 per
cent was given.

Cincinnati’s Drama
Tournament

THE Metropolitan Mu-
seum of New York
has undertaken to
serve the many neigh—
borhoods of the city from which few if any per-
sons ever do or can come to its galleries. Special
exhibits such as Art of China, Arms and Armor,
Ancient Egypt: Its Life and Art, the Art of
Japan, European Textiles and Costume Figures.
Ancient Greece and Rome, and the Near East
were shown in various institutions such as the
Public Library, high schools and colleges, and
branches of the “Y.” The high schools were
found to have special advantages because the ma—
terials could be used as collateral in many school
subjects and could be seen by students from all-
parts of the city instead of only by the general
public in the neighborhood. Over a five year
period the actual attendance for a total of 2,596
exhibition days was 1,450,031.

A College Play Day—Nearly twenty colleges
and universities in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky
sent delegations to the University of Cincinnati to
participate in the Tri-State Play Day held in
March. The event was sponsored by the Women’s
Athletic Association of the University of Cincin-
nati and the Women’s Division of the Depart-
ment of Physical and Health Education.

A Municipally Owned Seashore Resort—
Within ten minutes’ ride from the center of
Bridgeport, Connecticut, is Pleasure Beach Park,
an island of approximately thirty-seven acres, 75
per cent of which is devoted to an amusement
park, the rest to Parking and roadways. In addi-
tion to an excellent beach a half mile long on Long
Island Sound, there is a 150’ by 50’ salt water
swimming pool supplied with clear, filtered salt
water by a wellpoint system which uses the sand
of the island as a natural filter. The park was
originally a private enterprise operated by private
concessions on city-owned land with city-owned
buildings. In July, 1937, the city was obliged to
place a receiver in charge of the project and to
operate it as a municipal function. At the close of

Cedar Rapids, Iowa

the 1937 season the city began making improve-
ments in the park, paying for them out of its cur—
rent budget. A new pier was built and the well-
point system was installed. Throughout the sum-
mer season weekly dances were held in a spacious
ballroom. The Bridgeport symphony orchestra, a
WPA project, gave weekly concerts on Monday
evenings. A charge of live or ten cents was made
for the special attractions such as scooter planes
and sky rockets. A children’s playgrOUnd is pro-
vided, and there are picnic groves and athletic
fields and a stage. There is no charge for admis-
sion and parking is free.

A Year-Round Recreation System for Al-
bion, Michigan—Albion, Michigan, has insti-
tuted a year-round recreation system which is a
comparatively new venture for the city. Chase
Hammond is director of the department for which
$2,500 was appropriated as the first year’s budget.
Two thirds of this amount was given by the
Board of Education; one third by the City Coun-
cil. Cooperation by WPA in the provision of
workers has helped greatly in securing a maxi-
mum use of the facilities and funds available.

Social Clubs in New Brunswick — Social
clubs are becoming more popular each year in
New Brunswick, New Jersey. During the pasr
year the clubs met once a week at the homes of the
members. The groups discussed current topics of
the day and took part in such activities as knit-
ting, cooking, sewing, and crocheting. Refresh-
ments usually concluded the evening’s program.
The clubs also took educational trips during the
year and enjoyed theater parties in New York.
Each group of girls was sponsored by a recrea-
tion leader. At the present time there are six
such clubs with‘several more in the process of
formation.

The Audubon Camp—The National Asso-
ciation of Audubon Societies, 1006 Fifth Avenue,
New York City, announces the 1939 season of its
nature camp to be held at the Todd Wild-life
Sanctuary, Muscongus Bay, Maine, from June I6
through August 31, 1939. Adult campers are en-
rolled for one or more two-week periods. Dur-
ing this time all classes are held out-of-doors
where living forms of natural phenomena, includ-

ing birds, insects, plants and marine life, are
studied first hand.

Club 'Organization in Danville, Va.—The
Danville, Virginia Recreation Department an-
nounces an increase in the number of clubs or-
ganized, both for children and adults. Twelve
clubs are listed in a recent staff bulletin including
an Adults Chess Club with seventeen members
and 3. Boys and Girls Piano Club with a mem-
bership of thirty.

An International Association for Workers’
Leisure—An international conference on work- -
ers’ spare time was held in Brussels, Belgium, on 
December 10 and II, 1938, to draw up a consti- '
tution and rules for an international organization.
The conference was attended by the representa-
tives of seventy—nine organizations, including
twenty national associations. The name chosen
for the new organization was International Asso-
ciation for Workers’ Leisure. The executive
committee consists of twenty-five members ap-
pointed for a period of three years. Between
meetings of the executive committee, which must
take place at least once a year, the current busi-
ness of the association will be handled by a secre-
tariat composed of the five officers of the associa-
tion. Brussels was chosen as the headquarters of
the new organization.

A Group Work Institute—The School of
Applied Social Sciences, Western Reserve Uni-
versity, Cleveland, Ohio,will hold its annual Group
Work Institute on May 29—June 16, 1939. Staff
workers’ courses will be offered in Principles of
Group Work, Problems in Supervision of Group
Work, the Understanding of Individuals in Groups,
the Place of Creative Art in a Group Work
Agency, and Methods of .Workers’ Education.
Further information may be secured from the
director of the Institute.

Folk Dance Evenings in Detroit—Six of De-
troit’s leading folk dance societies during January,
February, and March offered a course in folk
dancing for teachers, recreation leaders, club ad-
visers, and folk dance enthusiasts. After a demon-
stration of a particular dance by the teaching
group those attending were given an opportunity
to participate. Emphasis was placed on the cor-
relation of the various folk arts. With this in
mind, the teaching group wore costumes, and
there was an exhibit each evening of background
materials, textiles, pictures, handicrafts, bibliogra-
phies on folk life, and reference to folk music. So
far as possible traditional instruments were used

to accompany the dancers. Six evenings were
:levoted to the course.

New Playgrounds for New York City—On
April Ist the Department of Parks opened offici-
1lly two new playgrounds which will add materi-
ally to the recreation facilities of the districts in
which they are located. One area, obtained by the
Department of Parks from the Board of Trans-
portation for an indefinite period, includes eight
tennis courts, nine handball courts, a volleyball
:ourt, and a sitting area for mothers and guard-
ans of small children. This area is surrounded
3y continuous rows of benches under shade trees
with two separate sand pits for the children to
play in. The second playground, adjacent to a
public school, was the first parcel of ground pur-
:hased jointly by the Park Department and the
Board of Education and developed in collabora-
;ion to the advantage of both departments. Be-
sides being completely equipped with play ap—
)aratus, the area also provides facilities for hand-
)all, basketball, paddle tennis, roller skating,
iockey, and ice skating. These two areas bring
:he total number of playgrounds available in New
York City to 383; 275 of these have been added
:0 the park system since January, 1934.

A Nature Study Camp — The Huerfano
Group of the Colorado Mountain Club will conduct
l nature study camp from June 11-25, 1939 at
:he Cuchara Camps ten miles south of La Veta,
Colorado. The program each day will consist of a
norninghike, an afternoon of games, projects or
iovel teaching methods, followed by an evening
:amp-fire program with songs and entertainment,
1nd a lecture feature. There will be three all—day
:rips. Further information may be secured from
Paul W. Nesbit, Superintendent, Huerfano County
High School, Walsenburg, Colorado.

Federal Music Project Orchestras—Two or-
:hestras of the Federal Music Project played for
:he recreation groups of Dayton, Ohio, through—
)ut the entire year. During the summer months,
:he large concert orchestra was assigned to play
:hree concerts a week, one each at Walnut Hills
Park, McKinley Park and Island Park. The
average attendance at each of these concerts was
1pproximately 150. During the community center
season, the dance orchestra played an average of
rive nights a week for community dances.

of the children’s pageant and circus of other years.

The observance in Escanaba, Michigan, con-
sisted of abolishing swimming check fees for the
day. As children came to swim, instead of being
asked for check fees, they were asked to think
about Joseph Lee “who was always more inter-
ested in the enjoyment of others than he was in
his own.” Material about Joseph Lee was posted
on the beach bulletin board.

A Hobby Craft Program for Cleveland

(Continued from page 68)
a few necessary chisels, and some glue, screws,

nails, and paint. A motor, buffers, blowtorch, vise,
and small metal craft tools went into the making
of the jewelry kit; similar tools comprised the
metal craft kit. Game crafts boasted a small ig saw
and a drill press in addition to the necessary small
tools. Materials for Keene cement craft were
bought for experimental purposes in order to start
this program. Luckily our leather craft specialist
had her own tools so this craft was initiated with-
out expense to us and will continue in this man—

‘ ner until we are able to buy the necessary supplies.

At this point all of our grant of $150 from the
Cleveland Foundation had been exhausted in one
delightful orgy of spending! “Flat broke,” we
faced the problem of getting materials for the
hrst classes scheduled to begin the first week in
January—and that only a week away! How we
did it is still a surprise to all of us, but the
classes started on time with the necessary ma-
terial and enough to carry them for a few class
periods. This gave us a breathing spell in which
to raise other funds or gather more materials. I

The Working Program

“’ith a kit of tools for each craft, a specialist,
and twenty-four weeks of the winter prograrri
left, we were faced with another question: hoxll
could we distribute our assets so that every per}
son could have an equal opportunity to share? ‘I

It was a problem in simple magic. Twenty-four
weeks, seven centers, seven craft kits, and seven
specialists were all thrown into the high ,hat, the
magic words were spoken, and the solution came
quickly! The craft program of each' center would
be divided into six four-week periods, each period
to run afternoon and evening two days a week——
all the time and space each center could devote to
the craft program. At the end of the four weeks,

kits, leaders, and crafts would depart to another
center, making space for another experiment with
a different craft. Thus in a period of twenty—four
weeks groups in each center would have a fair

taste of six different crafts.

Four weeks, you may say, is a very short time
in which to accomplish anything in a craft that is
new to you. You are just getting started. What
can you hope to do in that period? Can anything
worth while. be accomplished?

These questions were in our minds as we began
the program. We were sure, however, that at the
end of the experiment we would have valuable
information on the following points:

We would know which crafts were most popu-
lar at the various centers. This would enable us
to spend our crafts budget to the best advantage.

Since the space allotted to crafts was limited in
each center, we would be sure of using that space

Too often too much emphasis is given to mass
recreation and not enough to individual. We rec-
reation leaders are still “figure-conscious” and rate
the value of the activity by the number attending.
We know that this program will never make itself
known through mass demonstrations, but the pos-
sibilities to the individual are unlimited.

It is time for programs for the individual to be
considered and promoted. Hobby craft programs
seem_ to be the answer.

Leadership could be concentrated on the most

popular crafts instead of being spread around a
craft program of doubtful value and importance.

If at the end we could have information which
would enable us to use most effectively money,
leadership, and space—all -of which were limited
—the experiment would not have been in vain.
Working on this basis, we have given every
center’s clientele the opportunity to try each craft
long enough to determine which was suitable to
the individual. At the end of the first four weeks
a number of individuals have said to us, “I haven’t
had enough of this craft. I’d like to know more
about it.” If, on the other hand, at the end of the
four weeks’ program the individual feels satisfied
and is looking forward to the next experiment, we
know that person has not found the medium

shearing and pruning should be done when neces- '
sary. During dry seasons it will be necessary to
water both lawn and shrubs frequently. The main—
tenance of the informal type of theater is negli—
gible. The semiformal type requires more atten— '
tion because of the increase in the number of plant
materials used, and the problem of mowing is
complicated by the stage hedge. In the formal
type a more difficult problem of maintenance is
presented. The mowing of the lawn is more com—
plicated because of the stage wall and the wings. .
If the wall is planted, it will require some atten-
tion. The wings and background will have to be

Quiz Program. This is similar to the radio quiz
programs. Ask novel and humorous questlons
and encourage campers to ask their own questions.

Fire Building. Building a fire in the rain offers a
new challenge that campers will be eager to ac-
cept. Equip them with only two matches and let
them iind their own tinder in the woods. Excel-
lent materials for starting tires are pine knots,

ground cedar bark, birch bark, old squirrel and
Held mouse nests. This may lead to preparation of
fire building kits and practice in making tire by _
friction and with Hint and steel, all of which can
be done on rainy days.

Sunshine Pool. We are all weather prophets.
Write down camper’s prediction of the time the
sun will come out and see who is the best weather
prophet.

Pet Show. Give the campers some time to make
pet animals out of clay, wood, paper, corks, and
rags, and place them on display. Judge for the
largest pet, smallest pet, handsomest pet, homliest
pet, most unique pet, and other characteristics.

Storytelling. There is no better time for story
telling than on a rainy day with the group gath-
ered about a fire place. Encourage the campers to

tell stories.

An excellent variation is the progressive story.
One of the members of the group starts a story
and each member around the circle adds to it.

Playgrounds as Community Centers
(Continued from page 81)

volley ball will need two or three extra players
and will induce some young men to join them.
Generally the men are, or appear to be, reluctant
to play with girls. They have such a good time,
however, that others join them. After a few
nights it becomes the accepted thing, and on many
grounds young men and women play volley ball
together night after night. On dance nights they
come early to play a game or two before the dance
begins.

It is a really inspiring and soul-satisfying ex-
perience to walk onto a playground in the early
twilight hours to find the place teeming with
activity; young men and women playing, shouting
and laughing together; men and women playing
shufiieboard, table tennis and checkers, or just
talking with their friends and neighbors—in short, 
making the playground a real community center.

trips to foreign lands they acquire knowledge al-
most as vivid as if the experience were real.
Most of them probably will never have an op-,

next best way is almost as much fun. They learn
also to acquire a friendly feeling for foreign

A penny for your thoughts?

No siree, not mine! 

Would be the reply of the children in Mrs.
{occa’s group if such an offer were made to them.

And who wouldn’t? For their thoughts have
«rings—beautiful, white, sailboat wings that carry
hem far, far off to distant shores of foreign
ands, to the sunny banks of the Lido, and lovely
Venice, to the snowy slopes of Switzerland, and

rattle boat, or Queen Mary cabin class, what dif-
'erence does it make to these children with the
vorld at their feet? They may not come back
vith candid camera shots of Notre Dame and the

-'ul pictures their imaginations have created for
hem will last through the years.

fruit banks mentioned were a clever idea and easy
to make—papier—maché made over clay forms and
painted to look like apples or other fruit. The
fairy castles were made of oatmeal boxes and
mailing tubes, covered with a clay mix. The dolls
were made of inner tubes, cloth and other ma-
terials; some were made over milk bottles and
designed to be used as door stops.

Parade and Rip van Winkle Play

The wind—up of the season was the colorful
Parade from Fairyland and the Rip van \Ninkle
pageant. Each playground had a float in the par-
ade portraying one story (not Rip van Winkle) in
costumes and decoration of Hoat. The \Nilkes-
Barre Railway Company cooperated by furnishing
free transportation.

Other Activities

Aside from the activities in connection with
“On Wings to Fairyland” each playground had
scheduled games for the three age groups in vol—
ley ball, baseball and quoits, twice and three times
every week. A midsummer track meet was held
in each neighborhood and a final event in Kirby

tating group rehearsals during the week be-,;
fore the performance. Two final rehearsals;
were held at Lauer’s Park, where the pageants
was given. The younger children came to only}
one of them. .

The park was made to represent an Indian
village with a large council fire in the center.
Tepees of all descriptions, made as play-C
ground projects, Awere used in a semi—circle;
around the fire. The material used ranged from:
burlap and blue-dyed muslin to real skins:
Grouped around the tepees were many ever-f
green trees donated by the city from its over-‘1
crowded watershed near one of the city reser-I‘,
voirs. The costumes were made by women ofe
a WPA project. The ornaments, by the.
wearers.

The playground orchestra provided the
music before the pageant and for the dances.
The signal to start was the igniting of the fire
and “the arrival of the sixty tom-tom heaters
ranging in age from seven to nineteen. They
set the mood for the entire show with their
kegs covered with taut inner tubing. Leaders
were assigned to each group, thus easing the
problem of discipline and direction. Next fol-
lowed the dedication of the tepee by two
braves and a woman from the playground
where the tepee was made. Then entered the
other women and braves, with the latter lining
up for the soldiers’ dance. After this the
women did the Owl dance. 5

As they were finishing, the small childrenl
rushed across the field pursuing the Medicine:
Men who then supervised the little girls in "
“Squirrel in the Trees” and “Cat and Rat,"
and the little boys in “Step on the Rattler”
and “Rat on His Lodge.” The final players,
led all the little children in a grand “FollowI
the Leader” to the bleachers where they could
watch the rest of the pageant. As they were;
leaving, the next group of boys and girls ap—E
peared, the girls playing “Flower and Wind”
and “Snatch the Moccasin.” After this the
boys took part in “Flying Stick” and “Bear 
the Pit.” As the bear was being caught alli ‘
dropped back for the tournament between a~

representative from each of thirty playgrounds
who engaged each other in “Indian Strong-
hand,” “Indian \Vrestle,” and “Cock Fighting.”
These winners led all of this group to the
bleachers, leaving the field to the women, the
Braves, Ishnela and \Nhean. The orphaned
children had tried to participate in every sport
but were repulsed. Now the men, with the help
of the women, participated in a peace pipe
ceremony. Then the men went into council.
The remainder of the story has been told
previously.

To give the semblance of Indians, diluted
Bol-Armencian was used on the skins with
the help of some colored grease paint lining
pencils for the braves. To help give the
pageant coherence the leaders used the infor-
mation given by the supervisors of dancing,
games, symbols, and ceremonies.

ganized athletic teams by providing the entry fees
to municipal leagues. In 1938 there were twenty-
two such clubs, with average membership of 30,
making a total membership of 660.

Good Manners Classes. Classes in good man-
ners and courtesy informally conducted were an
innovation last summer on the playgrounds of
Hamilton, Canada. A growing tendency toward
discourtesy on the part of the children in their re-
lationships with the supervisors led to the sug-
gestion that the plan be tried of giving instruction
in good manners and etiquette.

The main problem in conducting classes was
to maintain the children’s interest. In doing this
informal classes were found to be more success-
in] than formal groups. The usual procedure was
to announce, not a class in courtesy and good man-
ners, but a story hour when stories were told which
would illustrate the importance and desirability of
:ourtesy. Many practical illustrations were intro—
duced based on playground happenings, the super-
visor deviating from the regular story to explain
prOper procedures. The subject of courtesy was
unobtrusively introduced- very successfully into
handcraft classes. On some grounds a special
period in the afternoon session was set aside for
:he discussion of courtesy and good manners, the
:hildren having previously been told that an inter-
:sting talk was to be given.

Discussions of the subject were publicized by
various methods. Tea party groups, however,

The Memphis Cotton Carnival

DOWN IN MEMPHIS plans are being made for
the ninth annual edition of the South’s

“Greatest Party.” The Memphis Cotton Car-
nival, an annual non-profit civic organization
has scheduled its celebration for May 9th-I4th.

A new entertainment feature of this year’s
Carnival is a national air show with stunt
flying and other spectacular exhibitions to be
held on May 14th at the city’s new municipal
airport. Among other features of the cotton
fete are daily parades, parties, balls, receptions

and a variety of interesting and educational
activities.

The Children’s Activities Division of the
Association has scheduled a parade for several
thousand children of Memphis and its sur-
rounding territory. Registration of participants
in the children’s parade is under the super-
vision of Miss Minnie Wagner, Superintendent
of Recreation of the Memphis Park Commis—
sion, and children taking part in the parade
are selected through playground and school
officials. Entertainment for the children cul-

minates in the children’s ball to be held at the
Municipal Auditorium.

The usual track meet, which includes par-
ticipation of athletes of national prominence.
will be held on Friday, May 12th. Other sport
activities include a skeet shoot, boxing matches
and playground competitions.

The Cotton Carnival, although primarily an
entertainment enterprise, has its serious side
in the production and exploitation of cotton.
This year Carnival officials have scheduled a
“New Uses for Cotton Exhibit” to be on display
in Memphis during Carnival week through the
cooperation of the Cotton Research Founda-
tion of Mellon Institute of Pittsburgh, Pa.
The complete exhibit showing the numerous
new uses of the South’s primary agricultural
product developed recently through cotton re-
search chemistry will be on display in connec-
tion with a Cotton Fashion Show during
which attractive models will display modern
style trends in cotton garments.

The Negro section of the Carnival, “The
Beale Street Cotton Makers Jamboree” has for
its theme this year “King Cotton’s Thorofare”
depicting the life and habits of the Negroes in

the deep South.

proved most successful. At an imaginary tea
party the girls would be given instruction con-
cerning the proper methods to be used in meeting
people, in opening doors to visitors, in answering
the telephone, in associating with friends on the
playground, and in showing consideration for
others in all playground activities. Much interest
was aroused in typewritten statements regarding
'courtesy and good manners expected on. the play-
ground which were posted on the bulletin board.

The 1938 season saw five hundred children en-
thusiastically participating in discussions of good
manners.

may have had, and all her time training in technique
of production are of the utmost value to her. But
she will also have to learn from her own experi-
ence that to these things, something more must
be added in a camp dramatics job—the ability to
“makeshift,” and to do it in such a delightful
way that nobody at camp will miss the trappings
and glitter of the more formal kind of production
to which he is accustomed at home. If at the same
time she is able to build up in her young audience
an appreciation of and a delight in new forms
and e'icperiments (either of her own invention or
adapted from the current trends in the best of the
modern work) in production and acting, and in
her players and production staff a real experi-
mental and creative urge toward these things, she
need not be ashamed to think of her job as im-
portant in the scheme of things dramatic and the-
atrical. It is a job which challenges the young
director to use every ounce of mother wit she has,
and a job which can be the best kind of training
ground for later work, either of a more profes-
sional nature in the regular or community thea-
ter, or for leadership in educational-recreational
programs of dramatics. Above all, it is a job
which contains much self-satisfaction within itself
for the director, in the provision of opportunities
for service to individuals, the group, and the big
field of dramatics itself.

A period is devoted daily to nature hikes and
study. Each camp has its own nature museum.
For children who seldom have the opportunity to
romp on the green, or roam through the woods
and to see bird life, this is a rare opportunity. Out
of such a program should come a greater respect
for tree, shrub, plant, and bird life. Beautiful
things, the children learn, are made to be seen and
admired, and not to be destroyed.

Fiscal. The City Council has annually appro-
priated the sum of $10,000. for the day camp
project. Of this amount, in 1938, $4,960. was
spent for 24,688 lunches at $.20 per lunch;
$2,028.75, for transportation; $62.50, for car
checks for volunteer counselors; $13.38 for the
camp director’s car expense for gasoline and oil ;
$2,387.50 for salaries and wages; and $49.30 for
printing of registration cards and similar supplies.

Last year the camps were operated for a period
of six weeks—July 18th to August 26th—and in
former years for seven weeks.

A total number of 4,351 children enjoyed a
week’s camp experience. Many of these, if it
were not for the day camp, would never have the
opportunity of visiting the city parks and would
be forced to spend the hot summer vacation
months in their own neighborhoods either on the
streets or around their sub—standard homes. The
close contact with nature cannot fail to affect the
children physically, mentally, socially and spiritu-
ally. It is an investment which gives good returns,
and one which might well be made a permanent
feature of city life.

There should be no hesitancy on the part of our
City Fathers to allocate funds for a project which
brings happiness in the lives of many children,
and which, furthermore, starts many on the road
to good citizenship. A week’s camp experience is
certainly beneficial, but not enough. Consideration
should be given to having those who need this
kind of experience spend at least the entire sum-
mer in camps. Some of us are of the opinion that

the day camps might well be operated the year
round.

116 SWIM FOR HEALTH H’EEK

Swim for Health Week

HE FOURTH annual national Swim for Health

W'eek will be celebrated June 26th to July Ist
under the sponsorship of the Swim for Health
Association, 122 East 42nd Street,.New York
City. This year emphasis will be placed on a
learn-to-swim drive, and. it is suggested that
during the week swimming exhibitions and
meets can be staged at municipal and school
pools. It is also hoped that there will be a
publicity campaign designed to focus attention
on the health values of swimming as well as its
recreative features. Newspapers will publish
stories and a series of swimming lessons; news
releases and radio talks on the value of swim—
ming will add to the effectiveness of the

campaign.

All campaigns will not be the same, but there
are certain attractions which can be featured
to advantage by recreation officials. One such
event is the conducting of special learn—to-
swim classes at swimming pools for boys and
girls from six to fourteen years of age. Classes
for adults may also be conducted at this time,
as may life saving courses for competent swim—
mers who should be trained in rescue technique
in preparation for the summer swimming

season.

Last year, according to Martin Stern, Execu—
tive Secretary of the Swim for Health Associa-
tion, a number of recreation boards participated
in the campaign and planned special activities.
Among these cities were Pittsburgh, Cincinnati,
New Orleans, Birmingham, Peoria, Duluth,
Kansas City, Bridgeport, Springfield, and
Tucson. Recreation executives who are in-
terested in having a share in this year’s cam-
paign may secure from the Swim for Health
Association stamps and posters and other
promotional devices.

places as factories where scrap leather, felt,
hooks, and other material could be found for
for very little expense.

Many games that children could make and
enjoy playing were made and decorated. Paint-
ing the swings, seesaws and toys on the play—
ground; adding birdhouses and feeding sta-..
tions; creating such necessities as coat hangers,
coat racks, door fasteners, and similar articles
from the limbs of trees were among the sub-
jects taken up.

“Why?”

Why we should use such materials is the
question of some who have not had experience
in working with children. We believe that it is
the heritage of every child to have access to
materials with which he may satisfy the crea-
tive urge. It has been proven that the
overprivileged child who has quantities of ex-
pensive toys finds joy in making things out
of materials he finds, with his own hands
designing and building a toy, making a neck—
lace or a picture lantern which really works.

There is a place for art in even the poorest
of homes, and the many children who have
only the necessities of life would never, with-
out the use of inexpensive materials, have the
opportunity which is the birthright of every
child, to know and use the creative urge to
transform ideas into three dimensional experi-
ments rather than into the-spoken or written
word alone. These experiments often give the

child self-respect.

“How?”

How we can make mere materials function

 

A Manual of Settlement Boys' Work

Through a regrettable oversight there was fail—
ure to give credit in the article in the April issue
of RECREATION on “Leadership, Organization and
Program Making in Boys’ Club Groups,” to A
Manual of Settlement Boys’ W 0713 edited by John
M. Kingman of Lincoln House Association and
Edward Sidman _of Hecht Neighborhood House,
Boston, and published by the National Federation
of Settlements. The Association is indebted to
this Manual for a number of statements, particu-
larly for the material on “General Principles of
Program Development,” for the suggested con—
stitution, for much of the material under “The .
Mechanics of Club Organization” and under

“Leadership.”

CAMPAIGNING FOR INDUSTRIAL SALVAGE 117

in our recreation program was our last big
question. We must have leaders who know
and love children. A person must be able to
see beauty in commonplace things. “Things
that function are beautiful.”

To free the child and give him materials that
he can use is our first step, and the leader must
know the possibilities and limits of materials.
A studio or an elaborate plant is not necessary
as a place to work, and a fund to buy expensive
art materials and tools is not needed to
carry on a worth-while, constructive, creative

program.

Campaigning For Industrial Salvage
(Continued from page 100)

its leather craft classes. The Mott Foundation,
which sponsors the night school program, relies
almost entirely on the collection of salvage for all
industrial classes, and, in addition, most of their
stage scenery and game room equipment are now
made from salvage.

The industrial arts department now has in its
possession fifteen machines, including five milling
machines, four drill presses, one shaper, two tool
grinders, one electric arch welder, one band saw,
and one surface grinder. These machines are all
in good running condition and are being used full
time in the shops with very little repair expense
necessary. When these machines were given to
the schools some of them needed minor repair, but
others were in excellent mechanical order.

It is estimated that the cost of the supplies,
tools, and machines which are given to the schools
in Flint each year by all industries would amount
to approximately $7,000. This is a real contribu—
tion when one realizes that instead of curtailing
the industrial arts department and laying off
teachers, the department has grown each year all
through the depression. The plan is of benefit to
the students because they are now supplied with
many materials for which they formtly paid, and
many more students are now taking industrial arts
courses than ever before. Any student who wishes
to use salvage is given this material. Many proj-
ects are made entirely from salvage while others
are constructed from materials purchased by the
Board of Education, with salvage used to SUpple-
ment the new supplies.

Business Men Cooperate

The program has been sponsored since its be—
ginning as one of the chief activities of' the Junior

Chamber of Commerce which is devoting one of
its regular membership meetings each year to
school and industry night. The industries furnish
excellent speakers for the program, and this meet-
ing is proving to be the largest dinner 'meeting of
the year. Many business men are interested in the
program, and some of them-have invited as many
as hfty of the best boy craftsmen in Flint to at—
tend the dinner as their guests. Industrial leaders
who have cooperated in the program are invited
to attend as guests of the Chamber of Commerce,
and school board members and labor leaders are
also among the guests. Through these contacts
and others a spirit of friendly feeling has been
created toward the schools, and the program has
aided all phases of education because schools.
business, and industry are now working closely
together.

The Chamber of Commerce has made arrange-
ments for the schools to have some central busi-
ness house for an exhibit of all articles made from
the salvaged material. This exhibit, shown a week
prior to the banquet, attracts thousands of people
and creates interest in the affair. All of the out—
standing projects are brought in for display, and
an effort is made to show only the unusual pieces

of machinery that have been constructed. Students
give demonstrations of welding, electrical work,
and the different uses of the electric eye in
industry.

One of the finest developments resulting from
contacts with industrial and business men through
the salvage program has been the organization of
a school placement department made possible by
the interest of industrial leaders. One of the
plants which has aided the schools has hired over
a thousand school graduates since 1935.

Business and industrial leaders now feel they
have a part in the school program and are glad to
visit classes and make suggestions for the im-
provement of instruction. Many of these men are
experts in their fields, and school men have gained
much help and information through their coopera-
tion. Many of our industrial leaders now request
to be taken through school shops. They ask many
questions about school organization policies and
glean information which is of help to them. One
group of factory superintendents who visited the
classes at their own request was so impressed with
the safety organization plan we were using with
great success that they requested copies of the
safety engineer’s check sheet to Show to some of
their shop foremen.

we may judge by the suggestions and comments
coming to the program committee. Recreation
leaders rightly think that the recreation movement
has something uniquely important to say about
that subject. The best speaker available will dis-
cuss recreation from the point of View of de-
mocracy. The discussions will bring out the prac-
tical means by which recreation contributes to
democratic processes and helps build good citizens
for a democracy.

Boston is rich in historical, architectural, art
and music irRerests.

And then there is the New York World’s Fair
to be seen as a secondary attraction. 'It’s only five
hours from Boston and can be seen best before or
after the Twenty-Fourth Recreation Congress is
over. Perhaps you will do that on the way home
-——and it is worth doing.

News regarding special railroad rates will be
sent out later. Long range planning is essential to
good recreation. Plan now, decide soon, and do

not fail to come.

Nature in Recreation

By Marguerite Ickis. Order from author. $1.00.

N HE PURPOSE OF Nature in Recreation is twofold,”
says Miss Ickis in her introduction, “to inject fun

into a recreation program by introducing nature through
the different activities, and to indicate some workable
approaches and methods which will create an awareness
of living things in the world about us.” With these
objectives in mind, she has used her booklet to introduce
nature to children in a friendly, intimate fashion by
suggesting activities under the following headings:
Nature in Camping, in Handcraft, Games, Dramatics,
Music, Dance and Aquatics. The suggestions range from
hiking to the making of a nature museum; from nature
jackstraws to a nature theater. There is a fund of infor-
mation in this mimeographed booklet of 80 pages which
will be invaluable to the camp counselor, playground
worker, and many Organizations providing activities for
children. Delightful illustrations add to the interest of
the book. Copies may be ordered from the author at 70
Morningside Avenue, New York City.

Edited by Ivah Deering. Obtainable from Mrs. Iva‘h
Deering, 1118 Cypress Street, W. H., Cincinnati, Ohio.
Single copies $.10; in quantities of 100, $7.00.

THE CONCLUSIONS presented in this pamphlet, which are

intended for the use of individuals engaged in com-
mittee work, are the result of more than sixteen hours
of group discussion at a Conference on Committee Pro-
:edures conducted under the auspices of the Woman’s
City Club of Cincinnati. The findings are offered in the
hope that they will help to clarify the thinking of the
Iew chairman toward his task and to assist him in
Ittaining a point of view as well as a course of action
which will make his work effective in whatever type
of organization he may function. Practices which have
failed and others which have succeeded have been studied,
1nd a few practical suggestions and some concrete

:echniqucs have been worked out as a contribution to the
:Hicient working of democracy.

Keep Fit and Like It

By Dudley B. Reed, M.D. Whittlesey House McGraw-

convinced me that they may contribute much to the health
and satisfaction of adults. However, exercise is not a

cure-all and may do harm as well as good. It should,
therefore, be undertaken intelligently. Everyone should
attempt to choose the recreations that are likely to be
the most enjoyable and beneficial to him.” This note of
enjoyment in activities permeates the book. It is present
in the first chapters devoted to the effects of different
types of exercise and the mechanisms by which each
type is carried on. It is inescapable in the later chapters
dealing with some of the physical recreations. And the
reason for this may be found in Dr. Reed’s own words:
“I have indulged, or now indulge, in all the sports con-
sidered except bowling and badminton with a good deal
of zest and approach them as a participant with gaiety
and levity; I am a firm believer in joy.”
