all peoples of the earth revere by whatever name or
sign, we pause once again humbly and reverently
with Thee, who art ever by our side, in happy and
grateful remembrance of the birthday of Thy be-
loved Son. 7i? 7% 3’1?
We workers in recreation, whose lives are dedi—
eated to the enrichment of living of others, feel a
special closeness and kinship with Him as, in addition to his lofty
qualities, many of the things of which we speak to others and teach
as vital to the fullness of living were a natural, integral part of His
life. it if? if?

He knew the hiker’s joy of the open road, the beauties and the
fragrances of lily-jeweled iields, the roll and lift of a sturdy boat
under sail, the pungent smell of wood smoke as He broiled a fish
breakfast for night-weary fishermen on the shore of Galilee.

He enjoyed the companionship of dining in home and banquet
halls or wedding feast and His presence must have brought beauty
and purity and gladness. 713' 3’1? it

His were the satisfactions of the exacting demands on hand and

laughter, and of the healing quiet of solitude, whether in prayer or
meditation, at the close of day. if “it? it

The love and laughter of little children were close to His heart.

But transcending all is His great gift. He gave to us in one
sentence, surpassing the Golden Rule, the secret of achievement of
true greatness in ours or any field, His Crimson Rule of Love: “This
is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
you.” if! if? 71‘?

For Himself first and then for His warm human attributes we
rejoice with Thee, Father of all mankind, in joyous happy, thankful
celebration during this His birthday month. it? it] it:

Help us each day, we fervently beseech Thee, so to walk in

the pathway He has trod that others may hear in our footfalls the
echoes of HIS own, as we pass by.

Amen.

0n the Cover

Christmas comes on the Soft, silent wings of snow
to city, town and country-side, carrying with it into
every nook and cranny a lifting of hearts, a joyous
resounding of the warm sweet words, “Peace on
earth, good will to men!” The original watercolor
for the cover was painted by the RECREATION Maga-
zine artist, Condie Lamb of New York City.

Next Month

The January 1957 issue of RECREATION will start
the new Year with some few constructiVe changes,
among them more good material for the Program
Section, of the type previously published in Recrea-
tion Program Aids. We hope that the magazine will
be even more useful to program leaders, church
workers, school teachers, club leaders—everybody
who needs good program ideas—as well as to recre-
ation executives. Among the January articles will
be one on parks, one on publicity, one on the
launching of the new International Recreation AS-
sociation. “The Dug-Out” is a story about a youth
center, while “Some Yardsticks for Relating Recrea-
tion Participation to Costs” deals with human
values. Don’t miss the excellent material for lead-
ers in “Musical Games and Their Creative Use.”

Dr. Julius Mark

“Despite amazing progress in science,
man is still plagued by tension. Not
more knowledge do we need, but more
of the milk of human kindness.”

L'R WORLD NEEDS many things today, but its chief re-
0 quirement is wisdom.

We have made incredible progress in unveiling

the secrets of nature. We have made the earth yield more

abundantly than ever before in human history. We have

pushed back the frontiers of disease with wonder drugs and

vaccines. We have witnessed the human lifespan prolonged
to a remarkable extent. We have unlocked the door of the
atom, resulting in an inexhaustible source of power not only
to destroy, but to build, to heal and to open new avenues
for making life healthier and happier. '

In view of the astonishing progress that has been made
by science and technology, one might think that ours would
be an age of optimism, serenity and hope. Yet, as we look
about us, we find that the very opposite prevails. Our world,
alas, suffers from fear, tension and insecurity. It is obvioUs
that there is lacking in modern life something which pre-
vents us from enjoying the fruits of man’s prodigious
progress.

More than two thousand years ago, the author of the
Book of Job in the Bible, examining his own times, was as
bewildered as are we, when he declared: “Man putteth
lorth his hand unto the rocks; he overturneth mountains
by the roots; he cutteth out rivers from among the rocks;
he buildeth the floods from overflowing. That which is
hidden, man bringeth to light, but where is wisdom to be
found? Man knoweth not the price thereof.”

Despite astonishing progress made since the days of Job,
man himself has hardly changed, a fact which is in a large
measure responsible for the present-day spirit of pessimism
and (leleatism. Our knowledge has been increased immeas-
urably, but man has remained substantially the same. How
few and puny are his achievements: as a human being.

Editorial

From the beginning of this century up to the outbreak of
World War 1, our horizon was filled to overflowing with
the wildest dreams and most extravagant of hopes.

Sociologists believed that they would soon abolish poverty
and eliminate crime. Scientists felt that, through the con-
quest of disease and the prolongation of human life, man
would not only be healthier and live longer, but would be
happier. lndustrialists claimed that the machine age would
provide man with so much leisure that universal education
and culture would be inevitable. Religionists dreamed of the
brotherhood of man being near at hand, since closer rela-
tionships were being developed through advances in com-
munication and tranSportation.

The fallacy inherent in these dreams consists in this:
While we considered the amazing progress that had been
made in' the conquest of nature, we left out of account
human nature, which is man himself. Because our material
progress has not been paralleled by moral progress, the
wonders man has achieved have come to represent a threat
rather than a promise—which only wisdom can achieve.

What is wisdom? For one thing it is not synonymous
with knowledge, since men possessing knowledge may be
cruel, vindictive, destructive. Wisdom is a combination of;
discernment, discretion and sagacity. It involves a certain}.
amount of knowledge, to be sure, but it is principally the}
knowledge of human beings and the mutual respect, mutual
sympathy and mutual understanding which may be derived
from that knowledge. “Give me understanding,” cried the,
psalmist, “and I shall live!”

The tragedy of our times is that we have succeeded in
splitting the atom before acquiring the wisdom to unite
humanity. Our major need today is not for more knowl-,
edge as to how to fly through the stratosphere, but more
understanding of how to walk upon the face of the earth like
human beings created in the image of God. Not more sci-
ence do we require, but more of the milk of human kind-
ness. Not more bombs to destroy should be our aim, but
more of the balm of healing and building up the wounds of
mankind fallen into disunion. Not more “know-how,” but

cc V .
know-why”! Not more knowledge Is our greatest need,

but more wisdom! *

RECREATION

. . . howfs your human relafions?

Meeting people, talking to people, keeping them on
his side is of prime importance to the administrative
leader. Physical education director or recreation
leader he’d better know the ABC’s of gaining coopera-
tion, otherwise his educational program is liable to
have no support. Dr. Bucher discusses the democratic
approach to building good will. He outlines those vital

areas of budgeting, coordinating, staffing, directing,

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
  
  

and the moving force of public relations. The school.
the community, the government is aptly studied in all
their interrelationships. It is estimated that 5,000,000
individuals today perform administrative work.
Teachers in their close contact with parents, students
and fellow teachers of a necessity perform administra-
tive functions. It helps a great deal to be up to date
on aspects of organizational know how, through study
of this modern book.

come into his own in 1958, with the
celebration of the 100th anniversary of
his birth. A call to the American peo-
ple to observe this centennial has been
issued by the Theodore Roosevelt Cen-

formation of The Playground Associa-
tion of America, later to become the
National Recreation Association, and
was its first honorary president. (See
RECREATION, June 1956, page 260.) It
is interesting that this announcement
comes just as the Fiftieth Anniversary
year of the NRA draws to a close.

RECREATION

 

‘ Editorially Speaking

 

Company-Sponsored Play

Industrial recreation is growing into
a big business, according to an article
by Richard. Rutter in the November 12
New Y or]: Times. The rapid spread of
industrial recreation programs has
largely occurred since World War II.
Today, there is hardly a large industry
that doesn’t have one. ‘“It is conceded,”
says Mr. Rutter, “that the most effec-
tive programs are those under guidance
of a full-time director. But part-time
staff assistance is more frequent. Paid
directors are found chiefly in companies
with more than one thousand employ-
ees.” Costs are covered partly by the
companies and partly from “fees, vend-
ing machine profits, association or club
dues and canteen profits. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, for instance,
has its own store, profits of which g
toward recreation activities.” '

Why Recreation?

Leaders in the recreation field have
expressed to us the need to know the
why of recreation. Why do we do what
we do? Why do we include this activity
or that? Could we have a series of let-
ters on some of the why’s—or some
bangup short articles? Would you like
to read some? If so, write cine.

Reminiscing about the Congress

most enthusiastic
about the Congress hospitality, as well
as the program, and many visitors com-
mented on it. “Recreation people are
so friend‘y and they make your heart
feel good,” said one delegate.

Several representatives from other
countries spoke of our “pace” and the
constant rush to get to meetings. “Do
you always sit so much and so long?”
asked one foreign friend. American
delegates seemed so interested in so
many meetings and so many topics. The
conferences with individuals were most
helpful both ways—to Americans and
visitors alike, according to all accounts.
One delegate commented on help she

had received from a Canadian and a
US. delegate at a luncheon conference.

“This was a happy, serious and fruit-
ful Congress. The friendships will not
be forgotten.” This, graciously stated,
sums up the general feeling of friends
from overseas. Tennyson’s “I am a part
of all I have met” seemed so true.—
THERESA S. BRUNGARDT, Director of
Recreation, State of Vermont.

Cheer Up

The age peak for IQs is now put at
fifty instead of twenty-one! Twenty-one
as the intelligence peak, was challenged
in November by Dr. Nancy Bayley,
head of the Child Development Section
of the National Institute of Mental
Health, Washington, at a meeting of
six hundred leading educators in New
York. They were attending a conference
on testing problems, sponsored by the
Educational Testing Service of Prince-
ton, New Jersey. If her theory is true,
educational methods will be in for quite
a change, and older people can start
looking up.

A Case for More Parks

The increased demand for outdoor
recreation has forced park planners in
all areas of government to re-examine
their programs and raise their sights.
“This is especially true in the field of
state parks,” says Ben Thompson of the
National Park Service. in the magazine
State Government.

“More-people, more cars, more time,”
he goes on, “more money and more in-'
terest in this type of recreation are facts
confronting us.

“Parks generally are overcrowded.
Improved highways and the increasing
number of people who own automobiles
have made it possible for more Ameri-
cans to visit their state parks. Between
1946 and 1954 automobile registrations
increased seventy-two per cent, roughly
paralleling the growth in visits to state
parks. During this same period the av-
erage weekly earnings of production

workers in manufacturing increased
sixty-four per cent. These increased
earnings, together with the two-day
weekend and the growing practice of
paid vacations in industry, have also
contributed to the demand for more rec-
i'cation areas.”

ro and Con of Drag Strips

“How Can We Take the Heat Out of
the Hot Rods?” was the subject of an
editorial in the Saturday Evening Post
on September 22, 1956. “Contests
staged on public thoroughfares by feath-
erheaded kids are an increasing threat
to public safety,” it stated. “Hence the
‘drag strip’-——an off-highway proving
ground” . . . which, “under respectable
auspices, can get the speed out of their
systems without imperiling others . . .
Sponsorship often comes from local
civic bodies.”

Another side to the argument has ap-
peared, however, which questions the
use of drag strips as an aid to good
driving habits. Northwestern Univer-
sity’s Trafiic Institute recently reprinted
from a bulletin of the Association of
Casualty and Surety Companies an edi-
torial questioning the soundness of the
idea. '

“Hot-rodders and their police allies,”
declared the editorial, “insist that prop-
r-r'y operated drag strips completely
and permanently stop gasoline-powered
hoodlumism on public thoroughfares.
There is room for skepticism about that.
A National Safety Council committee
rceent'y embarked on a nation-wide
check of this situation, a thing badly
needed, in view of the scarcity of facts.
Until these returns are in, communities
under pressure to please the kids and
the cops by setting up a drag strip would
he advised to mark time.”

Kind to Comic Books

Comic books can be an important
means of educating children, according
to Dr. William Menninger, by portray-
ing basic human relationships, stimu-
lating vicarious experiences and teach-
ing moral virtues. Dr. Menninger, of
the Menninger Clinic, Topeka, Kansas,
and an NRA board member, addressed
the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation
Mass Media Awards meeting in New
York City during the summer, *

Hospital Recreation

Sirs:

Your item appearing in “Hospital
Capsules” in October 1956 RECREA-
TION, regarding recreation in the small
general, medical and surgical hospital
certainly deals with a controversial
issue. To a recreation director like my-
self, who has had several years GM and
5 hospital experience, now assigned to
one of two hundred beds, it is clear that
recreation for the short-term patient is
as much needed as for the long-term

patient—possibly using diflerent recre-
atlon activities.

The small GM and S hospital admits
patients who are sometimes on the bor-
derline between short-term and long-
term. Also admitted are patients who
enter before going on to a specialized
hospital, such as those with diabetes,
heart conditions, and so on. Are these
patients any less sick in their own minds
than the individuals who might be suf-
fering from the same conditions in a
specialized hospital? I believe the an-
swer is “No.” In other words, people,
in general, have a negative attitude to-
ward hospitals even when they believe
they are getting the best treatment.

~._. ._‘__ ‘ ._.—¥——__._

MORE THAN

———The Editors.

F or example, a patient who has been
blind only six months is going to be
less disturbed and feel less strange if he
can play a game, such as checkers. A
checkerboard can be easily improvised
by putting thumbtacks in the red chips
and securing toothpicks with scotch
tape on all black squares. In this way a
sense of touch can keep him occupied
for hours.

Are not individuals bordering on al-
coholism or mental illness going to ad-
just better and be more responsive to
medical treatment and hospital life with
the help of recreation?

In a small hospital, patients are not
hospitalized long enough to make auto-
matic adjustment to hospital life or to
each other, and hence need the influence
of a recreation worker. Socialization,
helping patients to do the things they
like to do, and helping them to adjust
to hospital life is where the recreator
plays an important part with short-term
patients.

How many of us realize how long one

week is when there is positively nothing -

to do but think?

Use in Giving Talks

Sirs:

I read the Golden Anniversary Issue
(June 1956) of RECREATION from cover
to cover, and wish to congratulate you
on an outstanding issue. It is one that
could be used by everyone who is in the
field of recreation or is a prospective
recreation worker. I personally plan to
take excerpts from the history and
growth of the recreation movement for
some of the talks I will be giving to

' service clubs, PTA’s and other inter-

ested organizations.

Mr. Prendergast’s article, “The Chal-
lenge of Today’s Leisure,” should be an
incentive to all recreation workers to .
present to their communities as wide a
variety of programs for all ages as
possible.

The many varied examples in which
community cooperation played a major
role in the different localities should
stimulate other communities to rally
organizations or the community in gen-
eral behind worthwhile projects. These
articles proved that more and more pco-
ple realize the necessity ofoa well-round-
ed recreation program to meet the needs
of leisure time.

I wish to again congratulate you on
an outstanding edition of your always
informational magazine.

ent of Recreation, Manchester, Con-

.necticut.

Attention, Professor!

Sirs:

In reply to Professor Bucher’s recent
editorial, “Must There Always Be A
Winner?” (October 1956), I wish to

make the following observations:

We must recognize that we are litfing
in a competitive culture and that from A
“womb to tomb” we are faced with com- '
petitive situations of one kind or an-
other. These may include competition
with environment, one’s self or others.
Even on a simple individual basis, when
we desire to improve our skills and un-
derstanding or attempt to extend our
horizons, we are competing with our
past and present. We cannot overlook'
competition’s prevading presence or its:
blessings of more abundant living.

When competition is so much a part
of our culture, to single out the schools
as “largely to blame” for that “consum-
ing desire to be on top” and for inter-
preting success to mean winning, power,
high grades and material possessions is
to place an unfair indictment against
our centers and systems of learning.
Recognition or “blame”: should be shar-
ed by other very important forces such
as the home, .mass media, social and
economic pressures, local, national and
international” situations. Our schools
are a reflection of society and they make

RECREATION

their greatest contribution to society
when they seek to help members of so-
ciety to clarify their own goals and
philosophy of life. Hence, one should
not be tempted to blame the schools for
those things which may seem “wrong”
in society itself.

Actually, is there anything wrong

with a desire to Win, to be on top, to '

have power, prestige, high grades, ma-
terial possessions, to make the social
register or to live up to the Joneses?
Are these really manifestations of dis-
torted values in life or a desire for su-
periority? Hardly! They sound more
like expressions of certain needs for
A feeling important, or achieving, of be-
longing, of being respected, of owner-
ship and of conforming. Certainly they
are symbolic of certain types of success.
They are not threats to desirable values
of security but are challenges as to the
way in which they are achieved and
what is done with them once they are
achieved.

The practice of living up to the
Joneses may not be linked so closely
with competition as it may be linked
with conformity and a desire for ac-
ceptance. Before this practice is con-
demned or condoned we must deter-
mine who the Joneses are in each case
and whether or not they represent more
desirable modes of living.

With reference to materialism as a
threat to spiritual values or as a distor-
tion of “real values,” it might be inter-
sting to note that in this peak year of

onsumption of material things we are
'n the midst of a religious renaissance.
i ’Iembership in American churches and
ynagogues now exceeds 100,000,000,
' n all-time high. This, coupled with
_oaring sales figures of religious books
nd over 1.300 religious newspapers
nd periodicals plus an unparalleled
3hurch building boom, leads observers
‘0 note that these trends are indicative

ot only of greater religious interest

but also of greater religious conviction.
The American public demonstrates its
values, its conviction and concern for
its fellow men in community services,
responding to the call for help and its
continued search for love, beauty, truth
and happiness. In our attempt to reach
for perfection, the ideal of all religions,
we become better people. Increased
materialism and spiritual progress may
appear to be a paradox in our society
although there is no reason why they
should not be compatible.

A redirection of the emphasis upon
competitive activities cannot guarantee
or even promise more well-adjusted,
useful and happy individuals, less spec-
tators in the stands, less patients in the
hospitals or the exclusive sales of Cadil-
lacs to the Joneses rather than to those
who try to live up to the Joneses, as
Professor Bucher infers. We cannot
solve life’s problems so easily.

Perhaps some answers to these com-
plex problems may be found in each in-
dividual’s ability to assess himself real-
istically, of setting his goals accord-
ingly, of finding something to look for-
ward to, of enjoying the exhilaration of
doing something successfully, of being
able to solve most daily problems, and
of exploring the potentials of love and
understanding in all of their ramifica-
tions.

As educators we must be protective
and must free competitive activities of
undesirable practices if they exist. How-
ever, we must not become so protective
that we begin to forget that life is more
than just a game of ring-around-the
rosy without any winners or losers and
that challenge, conflict, mistakes, ag-
gressions, frustrations and disappoint-
ments are all normal experiences in liv-
ing. We should not be led to think that
the absence of these experiences in
childhood is the guarantee for the well
adjusted adult life and a “worthwhile,
resourceful” citizenry.

Superintendent of Recreation, Plain-

Words spoken against the music of
the Philadelphia Singing City Choir—
beautiful words, beautiful singing—
with the audience from many countries
joining in the closing chorus of “The
World Anthem.”

Thus the Second International-Rem
ation Congress, sponsored by the Na-
tional Recreation Association, opened
oflicially in Philadelphia on Monday
evening, October 1, 1956. A procession
of the flags of many lands followed that
of the United Nations into the assembly
hall, adding color and dignity to the
movmg ceremony.

This program, before a capacity au-
dience overflowing the Bellevue-Strat-
lord ballroom. was-planned and di-
l't'f'lt'd by Grace Walker, National Rec-

reation Association drama specialist.
It was performed by the Singing City
Choir2 led by Mrs. Elaine Brown, with
Rudolf Opperman of South Africa, Jean
Wolcott of the National Recreation As-
sociation Program Service, and David
Asherman, New York artist, taking the
speaking parts.

The evening’s address was delivered
by Morris L. Ernst, noted attorney and
author of the recently published Utopia
1976,3 on “New Sources of Energy, Lei-
sure and World Culture” in today’s
rapidly changing world: “For every na-
tion on the planet it will become a func-
tion of government to communicate to
people new knowledge dealing with the
creative and satisfying use of leisure. . .

“As manpower is replaced by other
sources of energy,” Mr. Ernst went on,
“the entire concept of recreation shifts."
What we do with these new leisure
hours . . . will determine the value of
our culture.”

Otto T. Mallery, chairman of the
Board of Directors of the National Rec-
reation Association, and Dr. G. D.
Sondhi, advisor on youth welfare of the

“Ministry of Education in India and ac-

tive in many other distinguished oflices, -
were chairmen of the evening.

“There is an idea, accepted by some!
of us, that we in the East are a spiritual
people, and you Americans are thor-
oughly materialistic,” said Dr. Sondhi.
“But when I came to this country a
short while back, I looked at your sky-

Institute for Executives

This was the first Institute in Recre-
ation Administration held at 3 Congress
and one of the most interesting and ex-
citing special conferences of the week.
It was held 011 Monday and Tuesday,
with the theme: “Advancing the Fron-
tiers of Recreation Administration.”

Sponsored by the NRA National Ad-

visory Committee on Recruitment,

Training and Placement, it was con-
ducted by a special committee spear-
headed by chairman Robert W. Craw-
ford, Philadelphia recreation commis-

sioner, and coordinator Dr. Paul Doug-
lass.

Although registration closed with one
hundred executives, 106 delegates actu-
ally attended. Including faculty and
committee, 122 persons participated in
one way or another. They represented
thirty-four states, Canada, Australia,
Pakistan, Greece, the Union of South
Africa, and the Virgin Islands.

In addressing this group, Dr. James
Charlesworth, president of the Amer-
ican Academy of Political Science, said
that the development of recreation in
the United States has been good, but
not good enough. “We need to capti-
vate the imagination of our councils, of
our communities. We need to be ag-
gressive, unashamed and egotistical.”

In blunt, outspoken language, he
called on public recreation to take the
responsibility for organizing creative
leisure. “An apprentice learning to’be
a journeyman cabinetmaker, working
ten or twelve hours a day, is more crea-
tive, in an environment that leads to
a sounder attitude," he declared, “than
the person working six hours, five days
a week, who after work is turned loose
on TV or some other unorganized activ-
ity. We have organized shorter hours
for workers, but we have not organized
creative leisure.”

The two-day course terminated with
a special dinner and awarding of cer-
tificates for participants. W

Over 200 Philadelphia PAL children.j0ined the audience and here are en-

A Foreign Delegate’s Impression of the Congress

The Second International Recreation Congress, in many ways, served to
herald and to manifest recreation as a dynamic and integral force in twen-
tieth-century living. Recreation had its humble beginning in sporadic at-
tempts to “keep children off the streets and out of mischief.” In not much
more than a decade it has emerged as a vital service of concern to all levels

The Exhibits

Eighty-two exhibitors, including six-
ty-two commercial representatives, were
accommodated on two floors of the Bel-
levuc-Stratford and in Reyburn Park
Plaza. Fifty-nine commercial exhibi-
tors already have signed up to “provide
exhibits at the 1957 Congress in Long
Beach, California.

of authority and community responsibility. ’

As demonstrated by the wide range and diversity of discussions at the
Congress, recreation has become a concept that embraces man throughout
his whole lifespan, in all spheres of interest and capacity and, also, in his
circumstances of adversity. '

To visitors from those countries where the best in organized public recre-
ation is yet to come, the Congress was more than an opportunity to share

SpOCial Honors in and to gain from the knowledge and experience of successful recreation '

During the week special awards and
citations honored outstanding recrea-
tion service:

Marion Preecc, district representative
of the NRA, received (I) a special cita-
tion and certificate of citizenship from
the governor of Tennessee (see page
17!), presented by Louis Twardzik,
recreation consultant, Tennessee Divi-
sion of State Parks; and (2) a silver
tray, as a token of gratitude and afiec-
tion, from the Tennessee Recreation So-
ciety, presented by its president, Jack
Spore.

(.Imrlcs E. Reed, director of the NRA
Field Department, received an Ameri-
can Recreation Society special citation
'in recognition of exceptional service
to his fellow men through the medium
ul recreation.”

Robert W. Crawford, recreation coin-
mI-sioner of Philadelphia. was honored

108

executives. The meeting in Philadelphia provided unmistakable proof that
recreation can achieve the recognition and enlist the support it deserves,
that properly integrated nation-wide recreation services,need not remain
just a dream. i

The formation of the International Recreation Associationprorpises to
be a momentous force in making mankind universally aware of ‘the' ever-
increasing significance of leisure and of its unlimited potentialitiesto make
this world a better and a richer one in which to live. Intended not only to
provide technical assistance to recreation movements in different countries,
but also to promote the interchange of leaders and of information, the
International Recreation Association might well become an important factor
towards better understanding and. greater appreciation among the 138013168
of the world. i

As one of many greatly benefited by attending the Congress, I know that
I will be conveying the sentiments of every visitor in paying tribute and
expressing a word of very sincere appreciation to the National Recreation
Association of America. The NRA has won for itself the admiration and
affection of recreation workers throughout the world- for the initiative~it
has taken in this matter and for making it the unqualified success it has

been.——RUDOLF W. J. OPPERMAN, National Advisory Committee for Physiul

cal Education and Recreation, Johannesburg, South Africa.

A Delegate Comments on Exhibits

One important feature to me year after year, and I am sure to all con-
ferees, is the opportunity to look over the wide variety of new supplies and
equipment available. It is always good to return from the Congress with
some of the these products as visible evidence of a direct benefit from the
national meeting. Tangibles of this type often provide more immediate
satisfaction to the delegate-sponsoring agency than a head full of ideas for
future projects. Both are valuable, however. For the purchase of larger
equipment, recreation executives return to their communities fortified with
printed and verbal facts to present to their boards or 'other supervisors.

This year some of the sellers of outdoor equipment set up a comprehen-
sive exhibit in a park pla'aa where it could be examined and tried. This
outdoor display was a real opportunity for delegates to observe closely
equipment under use-conditions. Noncommercial exhibits included, among
others, the American National Red Cross, American Recreation Society,
Annual Conference of State Inter-Agency Committees for Recreation, Edu-
cation-Recreation Conference of the National Social Welfare Assembly, the
Federal Inter-Agency Committee for Recreation, Department of the Air
Force, and Department of the Army. The attractive exhibits and displays
of participating countries carried out the international phase of the Con-
gress. For example, Israel’s display revealed how a new country has made
recreation progress“ during the periods of strife and unrest that have ac-
companied its birth. It has proven that recreation is a necessity and not
a luxury.

The exhibits are such an important part of the Congress picture that they
warrant the attention and scrutiny of every delegate. N 0 one in recreation
seriously interested in his work would permit himself to miss them.—

Nearly seven thousand peOple crowd-

times the audience was invited to join
in a dance with the folk dance group.

Delegates were again given .a treat
on Wednesday evening at a concert by
the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted
by Eugene Ormandy, in Convention
Hall. This special event planned for
guests of the International Recreation
Congress was under the auspices of the
city recreation department.

At the banquet on Thursday evening,
delegates listened to an address by The
Right Honorable The Lord Luke. He
brought with him an excellent motion
picture, Active Leisure, about recrea-
tion activities in England, featuring His
Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh
who is president of both the National
Playing Fields Association of England
and the Central Council of Physical
Recreation.

The tour of Philadelphia playgrounds
and recreation centers, which are being
constructed under the city’s twenty-five
million dollar recreation capital expan-

 

sion program, got off to a rousing start
on Tuesday afternoon, with all the
buses filled. So many people were left
over that a second tour had to be sched-
uled later in the day. Delegates re-
turned from both with glowing reports.

Notes from Demonstrations

Chief among the, treats offered dur-
ing the week was the performance of
Mara and her dancers. The Land of
the Playful Dragon, witnessed by sev-
eral hundred delegates and two hun-
dred children brought by the Philadel-
phia Police Athletic League, was a
charming dance play for children which
gave program leaders an exceptional
standard by which to measure presenta-
tion of folklore in ’drama or dance.
Many delegates were happy to learn
that this performance is available to
them for their own local communities.

Among other workshops and demon-
strations were “Creative Rhythms for
Children,” conducted by Malvena Taiz,
director of dance at the University of
Pennsylvania, with the help of two
groups of Philadelphia children, and a
presentation of folk dances and mixers
for recreation leaders by Olga Kulbit-
zky of Hunter College, New York City,
and Frank Kaltman.

Experts in folk music from many
parts of the world met during the Folk
M u s i c Workshop. Throughout the
week, delegates learned to sing the

songs of many lands. Chairman of this
workshop was Augustus D. Zanzig of
Brookline, Massachusetts, who for
many years was director of music for
the National Recreation Association.
He was assisted by Lynn Rohrbough of
the Cooperative Recreation Service.

Grace Walker and Grace Stanistreet,
director of the Children’s Theatre of
Adelphi College, Garden City, New
York, combined forces for a high-pow-
ered team demonstration of leadership
techniques for successful, creative
drama programs.

A Few Trends from Meetings

Industrial Recreation: “Programs for
employee recreation in the United
States have moved forward enormously
in the past ten years. There are over
twenty thousand firms now offering rec-
reation programs for their employees
and spending a budget for this purpose
of close to one billion dollars.”———DON
NEER, Executive Secretary, National
Industrial Recreation Association.

Recreation for the Ill and Handicapped:
At a session on “Professional Prepara-
tion for Hospital Recreation Person-
nel,” delegates agreed that hospital rec-
reation has arrived at the point where,
in order to compare with professional
groups functioning at the same level, a
broad, diversified undergraduate pro-
gram is imperative.

Long-Range Planning for Park and
Recreation Areas and Facilities: Such
planning is a MUST today. The meet-
ing highly recommended joint planning
by local, municipal, state and regional
agencies. (See “Future Suburban

Parks,” by Robert Moses, page 474.)

Armed Forces: “Recreation in the
aimed forces is BIG’BUSINESS. For
example, the Navy Motion Picture Serv-
ice needs over twenty-two thousand
complete programs to adequately serv-
ice the U.S. fleet and overseas stations.
Recreation is very broad—from jcs’
settin’ to playing football— and it
covers both sexes and all age groups.”
—E. M. WALLER, Head, Recreation and
Physical Fitness, Department of Navy.

International Exchange Programs for
Recreation Leaders: The international

grOUp attending this session recom-
mended, for the future, that: ( 1) each

470

Congress have an international school;
(2) RECREATION Magazine have a sec-
tion on international material; (3)
there be greater response from the
State Department; (4) consideration
should be given to student recreation
exchange program; (5) definite Inter-
national Congress dates be set.

General Sessions

Many fine addresses were given in
the plenary sessions of the Congress,
and in a great number of the discussion
meetings as well, but there is not room
to quote or reproduce all of them here.

talk on leadership by Dr. Paul Douglass
appears on page 498.

Dr. H. C. Georg von Opel, president,

of the German Olympic Society, told
the Congress, “The spirit of a humani-
tarian recreation movement is awaken-
ing in Germany and is endeavoring to
establish the democracy of human hap-
piness.”

Few will forget the words of Dimi-
trios B. Lezos, director of the Near East
Foundation Playground, Athens,
Greece: “Through recreation, world
peace and prosperity are possible. When
the citizens of one country meet those
of another—and I have seen this hap-
pen often — they naturally like each
other, because, in spite of language and
custom differences, people are alike.
They are born, they all eat, sleep, work
and love. And to do these things in
peace and reasonable prosperity is all
that anyone, anywhere, wants to do.”

Dr. Francisco M. Albizu of Brazil
stated, “We are eager for a better world
for our children, a world full of joy and

everlasting happiness. You will be glad
to know that we Brazilians have, in this

convention, decided to organize the
Brazilian Recreation Association so

that we may more closely cooperate
w1th the institution of which everyone

1s proud—the National Recreation As-
sociation.”

The last general ‘session was also an
exciting one, with representatives of
other lands summing up their experi-
ences and expressing their opinions on
“What the World Recreation Congress
Means to Me and What It Can Mean to
My Continent.” The meeting was chair-
ed by Major Adel Taher of the Council
of Youth Welfare, Cairo, Egypt, with
Mrs. Hendrika W. Boersma of the
Netherlands speaking for Europe, Tai-
suke Nishida of Japan speaking for
Asia, Margaret Wiseman of Sydney for
Australia, Rudolph Opperman of South
Africa for Africa, and Homero Gabar-
rot of Uruguay for South America.
Antonius W. van Baars, secretary gen-
eral, Catholic Youth Council, Utrecht,
the Netherlands, acted as chairman of
a resolutions committee, to express ap-
preciation.

Said Major Taher, “Let us, all of us,
wish for something and fight for it and
pray for it. Let us pray for freedom,
for all the nations, for everyone in this
world. Let us pray for friendship, for
brotherhood —— brotherhood to anyone
on this world. I met people from many
of 'the nations while I was at interna-
tional meetings in Europe—they meet
and are friends and brothers, and they
stay with each other for twenty or
twenty-five days. And when they leave,
everyone has sorrow in his heart that he
is leaving his brother, and he invites
everyone to visit his own nation. There
is souvenir giving among all nations,j
and these memories to take back to ourl
countries. The politicians believe Wel
are enemies—but we are people who
believe we are brothers and sisters all
around the world, so we pray for all.” I

Mr. Rivers, closing the session, re-,
plied: “I don’t know what I could add;
to that very moving expression of the
spirit of the Congress that we have just
heard from the chairman. It seems to
me that at no time in history has the
spirit of our recreation movement been
needed more in the world than today.

“We can all now go back to our lands
with renewed strength to perform the
historic mission which is now ours. And _
as we do it, there will be joy in our
hearts, knowing that in all parts of the
world there are men and women work:
ing for the same end.” *

“A

A. T AX AIRPORT in Vermont one day last December, a soft-
spoken. snowy-haired Santa Claus made his way down
a line of eager, shouting children, six deep. He paused every

step or so to say, “Merry Christmas,” and shake a mittened '

hand. Halfway along, a little boy pushed his way forward,
grabbed Santa’s arm anxiously and asked, “Did you get a
letter from John Henry Lewis, Burlington, Vermont?” “Yes,
I did." said Santa. “Well,” exclaimed the child, “that’s me!”

John Henry Lewis is an orphan, as are the hundreds of
other children who met Santa at the airport that day. They
will be meeting him again soon, for early this month Santa
Claus will climb aboard a C-4-6 transport at North Pole, New
York, to begin the first lap of an annual Christmas-Spirited
air trip called “Operation Toylift.”

At the end of eleven incredible days, if all goes according
to plan. St. Nick and his troupe will have traveled twelve
thousand miles and visited thirty-six airports along the east
coast of the [inited States and Canada. Gnomes will have
passed out lollipops and sung Christmas carols to thousands
of orphaned, disabled and underprivileged children who will
have been brought to meet their plane. Helpers will have
loaded onto wailing trucks toys for these children and their
friends [30,000 in all) who couldn’t get to the airports, and
a weary Santa will have shaken hands with, taken requests
from. and had his beard pulled by more wide-eyed young-
sters than he will possibly be able to remember.

Operation Toylift is a philanthropy which grew out of a
highly suecessful commercial venture—a toUrist attraction
in the Adirondacks called Santa’s Workshop at North Pole,
New Y ork.

storybook village come to life. Small log cabins with crooked
chimneys poking through brightly painted roofs house work-
shops where artisans, dressed as gnomes and elves, fashion
toys of wood, metal, glass and clay. On the steps of one of
the cabins, near the entrance gate, Santa Claus waits to greet
his visitors. He is an elegant St. Nick, Sporting a handsome
red suit, wavy white hair, and a long soft beard. He has
blue eyes with the legendary twinkle, and a warm, patient
way with the children.

Along one walk in North Pole there is a wishing well. Here
tourists drop coins to help buy the toys for Operation Toy-
lift. Their contributions are substantial—last year 584,000
peeple dropped $15,000 into the wishing well. To this the
North Pole Corporation added $30,000 to purchase all the
toys needed. . r

The whole story of North Pole, New York, has a fairytale
quality about it—beginning, as it did, in the mind of a child,
and being, as'it was, a success from the very start. It all!
began one winter evening in 1948 when Julian Reiss, father
of six, was driving part of his family from New York City
to their home in Saranac Lake. In the front seat beside him
was his sleepy"six-year-old daughter, Patricia. She asked
for a story and her father complied, with a seasbnal, spur-
of-the-moment tale about a little bear who went to the North
Pole on an iceberg to visit Santa Claus. When he finished,
the child asked, “Can’t we go to the North Pole?” Her
father, thinking fast, said no, there are no roads, and ice-
bergs are much too cold for people to ride on. After a mo-
ment, Patricia said drowsily, “Daddy, that would be the
very nicest place for us to go.” Then she fell asleep. Her
father, on the other hand, spent a wakeful night with an idea.
If Patty would like to go to the North Pole, he reasoned,
there must be thousands of other children who would be
receptive to such a trip. Why not, then, bring Santa’s work-

shop to them, or more specifically, to some spot in the snowy
mountains near Saranac?

RECREATION

   

 

Hundreds of children meet Santa at airports—wonder
and delight in their eyes. The fact that Santa’s heard
is genuine seems to convince them that he is not a fake.

He discussed his idea with friends, all of whom thought
it laughably impractical. Some time later, however, he met
Harold Fortune, a man who owned a suitable tract of moun-
tain land, and who thought the idea supreme. The two 'men
formed a company, built their village, and opened for busi-
ness in 1949. Business was good from the start, and it has
been getting better ever since. This year, between June and
November, 230,000 children brought 470,000 adults to pay
their off-season reSpects to Santa Claus.

With the wishing well and the toys it makes possible for
underprivileged children, the Christmas spirit of giving is
a living part of North Pole, New York. Mr. Reiss and Mr.
Fortune tried their first toylift the winter after they opened
for business. Confining themselves to New York State, they
ot in touch with sixty orphanages, asking for the number,
exes and ages of children to whom they might bring toys.

hey delivered presents to 2,000 children that year in Mr.
Reiss’s own Piper Cub. By the next year the toylift had
crown far beyond the capacity of the little plane, so Mr.
Reiss, an optimistic and persistent man, set out to find some-
-- to lend a larger one. I. - *i

That “someone” turned out to be the Esso Standard Oil

ompany. In 1951 Esso provided a plane which carried
anta, his helpers and specially selected toys to 15,000 chil-
ren. This year, the fourth in Esso’s plane, they will reach
bout twice that many. ’

The man most responsible for bringing Esso and Santa

laus together is Wes Keppel, a member of Esso Standard’s
ublic relations department, and to him has fallen the job

)f handling all details concerning Operation Toylift. It is

i = job he loves. Well before the toylift takes place, he is in
: ouch with people at North Pole, planning the route they
4' ill follow, setting up each day’s tight schedule, clearing
ith the airports, arranging for meals en route. Each year

' goes along on every trip, to see that plane, pilot and pas-

ngers fare well, and, he will assure you, has the time of

his life. Dressed in the red trousers and white tunic 0f Santa’s
helpers, he gets right into the act—talking and singing with
the children, passing out lollipops, seeing that every child
gets at least a peek at Santa Claus.

Like Mr. Keppel, all the members of Santa’s troupe get a
tremendous kick out of ,taking part in the toylift. In spite
of the exhausting schedule, the cold, the frequent rOugh
weather, the inconvenience of spending most of eleven days
crowded together in a stripped down transport plane, they
wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.

This is true, too, of Santa Claus, although the toylift takes
more out of him than out of the young people in his troupe.
As soon as the plane leaves an airport, while the others that-
ter or sing together, he closes his eyes and dozes off—partly
to conserve his strength, and partly, one suspects, because
he isn’t quite at ease in a plane. He spent most of his years
as a mountain guide, with both feet flrmly on the ground,
and though the toylift, with all its confusion and frenzy, is
fun; he confides that he doesn’t think he will ever quite get
used to it. So he dozes along until the plane dips ground-
ward. Then he jerks himself awake, smooths his handsome
red suit, takes out a comb and gently dresses his beard.

This beard always fascinates the children. While they
naturally reSpond to the fanfare and the bright costumes
worn by Santa and his troupe, the beard always steals the
show. Seeing that it is really Santa’s own seems to convince
them that this is 110 fake they have come to see.

Last year at the Boston airport, where a tremendous
crowd of children had turned out to see him, Santa bent
over to ask a very little girl her name. Speechless with joy,
she held his beard with both hands and nestled her face in
it. Just behind her a child, bundled in a wheel chair, leaned
forward and watched. Then she twisted her little body to-

ward a nun standing nearby.
“Sister!” she cried, her eyes bright with wonder, “He’s

real! He’s really real!” *

especially prepared for use at the
International Recreation Congress.

Robert Moses

111—: New York State Council of
Parks publishes reports, from time
to time, on present and future park
needs. The interests, of this council,
while directed mainly to state park plan-
ning, are concerned also with city, sub-
urban, county, town and village parks
and parkways, because all regional rec-
reation facilities are related and must be
coordinated in determining an adequate
geographical and population program.
The provisions of New York’s conscr-
vation law reflect this idea. They direct
that the council shall: “Act as a clearing
house for information on park planning
and administrative matters, and make
available information on parks and rec-
reation to counties, towns, cities and
villages, and shall advise as to connec-
tions and relations between state and
local parks.”

New York state parks fall into three
general categories: areas near Iarge cen-
ters of population where people can go
for a day’s outing; areas within driving,
walking or boating distance of cities
and towns where people can go for a
day’s recreation and perhaps stay over-

to spend several days, a week or an en-
tire vacation.

The relationship between national,
state, regional, cpunty and municipal
parks requires careful planning and co-
operation, because no logical balance of
recreation needs is possible without a
clear understanding of the territory each

unit of government should attempt to r

cover.

Obviously national parks—and I
don’t mean national monuments—will
be few and far between. They take in
vast areas of exceptional scenic, histori-
cal and scientific importance which can
be saved from exploitation and man-
aged only by Uncle Sam himself.

The line between the federal and state
or bi- and tri-state fields cannot be pre-
cisely drawn, but we know fair'y well
where it is. Most states will never have
a national park or very few of them, and
there is no usesitting around and wait-
ing for the federal Santa Claus to do
what the state itself should provide.

The line of demarcation between state
and municipal parks of various juris-
dictions is also hard to draw precisely.
City parks should. as a rule, be small
and numerous enough to serve all neigh-
borhoods for periods of play ahd rest
measured by hours, not days. To'wn and
county parks have similar limitations,
but serve groups of villages or unincor-
porated neighborhoods. If a ‘rcounty
park is so located as to attract, entice or

cater to thousands of visitors from a
great nearby city it will most certainly
be overrun and ruined. Only a state
park can accommodate such numbers
without spoiling everything for every-
body concerned.

I could give you plenty of illustra-
tions of advice given by our state park
ofiicials to their local brethren where
municipal and not state action was
called for. Usually such help is solicited.
Sometimes our advice is taken, some-
times not. Our Long Island State Park
Commission, for example, twenty-five
years ago gave the mayor of Glen Cove
a recommendation to expand a water-
front beach. Nothing happened. The
present mayor recently sought our ad-
vice, and we found no better solution
than the one we had advanced in 1932.
We again urged the addition before im-
minent subdivision and develOpment
made it impossible. After a quarter of a
century. present taxpayers, including
many elderly people living on pensions
and Opposed to all public Spending,
seem to be dead set against doing any-
thing whatsoever.

Progress on the state level has in some
states kept pace with the times, but few
states have fully anticipated the future.
Treaties between and among states for
jointly operated bordering parks are
still few and far between. The Palisades

Park and Parkway System (New York
and New Jersey) is an exception and its

contribution to the congeries of nearby
cities and suburbs is incalculable. Un-
fortunately, very little has been done in
the case of municipal parks and play-
grounds in the very suburban areas
where postwar increases in population
have created unprecedented needs, raised
property values, imposed heavy burdens
for all sorts of urgent services and utili-
ties, and made acquisition of adequate
park areas costly and difficult, if not
prohibitive.

Let us take one New York suburban
county as an example. Nassau County,
east of the New York City line, on Long
Island, one of the fastcst growing and
wealthiest areas in the nation, main-
tains about two hundred acres of park
in addition to one large county park
with three golf courses. The townships,
villages and two small cities are also
deficient in recreation space. If it were
not for the state park system on Jones
Beach and the suburban New York City
water supply reservoirs on the main-
land the situation would be bad indeed.
Certainly this is a pitifully small local
acreage for a present population of a
million and a quarter, to say nothing
of the future.

The record shows that the situation
in Nassau is typical of other metropoli-
tan counties, throughout the nation, un-
dergoing the strains of rapid suburban
growth. In Nassau, perhaps the greatest
lack is that of waterfront parks for bath-
ing, boating and fishing on the fifty
miles of shore on Long Island Sound.
The need has been apparent for many
years, but is more conspicuous and men-
acing now since the breaking up of

many large estates, the disappearance
of truck farms, and the relatively unreg-
ulated increase of subdivisions and pop-
ulation.

In this dilemma I advocate immediate
acquisition of desirable park property
by any legitimate method, scheme or de-
vice which has worked in the past—that
is, by ordinary gifts, individual or cor-
porate, by condemnation, by adding
small parks and playgrounds to rights
of way for parkways, expressways, thru-
ways, highways, by reclamation of low
areas, by drainage, by sanitation fills,
by pushing out the shorefront, by estab-
lishing joint school and park play-
grounds—in other words, by all the ac-
cepted, conventional means. But over,
above and beyond these devices some-
thing bold and entirely new is required.

The Long Island State Park Commis-
sion recently acquired additional lands
for Sunken Meadow State Park, on the
Sound in Suffolk County, fifty miles
from New York City, under a unique ar-
rangement. This was done by accepting
a deed which permitted the donor to re-
main for twenty years before the state
took over. I cannot urge too strongly
that no further time be lost in using this
device to set aside large estates and
golf and other clubs’as future county,
town and village parks, particularly on
the waterfront, both for active and pas-
sive recreation.

Gifts of land effective at a future date,
with tax exemption in the interval, are
by no means unattainable. No other
immortality is purchased as cheaply as
a gift of an estate, subject to occupancy
by the owner for a reasonable period,

 

later to be maintained perpetually as a
park by a grateful municipality, with or
without an endowment, forever enshrin-
ing a name which perhaps otherwise
would be forgotten. To be sure, I do not
recommend precisely this suave lan-
guage and logic in soliciting largesse,
adding codicils to wills and approaching
families and foundations. There must
be some finesse about these things, but
you get what I mean. The conserva-
tionist, like the almoner, knows how to
enter the cave of the Count of Monte
Cristo.

The same advice should be adopted
in acquiring urban parks where open
areas still miraculously remain within
city limits. Everywhere in metropolitan
districts, estates, clubs and even truck
farms offer possibilities of this kind
which should be promptlyuand impar-
tially investigated. Many golf, fishing
and gun clubs are centrally located, well
landscaped, and would make natural fu-
ture parks. If the owners will not sell
at fair prices and agree to a lease of say
twenty years at frozen taxes or no taxes
at all, I would have the city, county,
town or village condemn these big plots
and rent them back to other tenants or
operators. That’s not socialism; it’s just
common sense.

Other opportunities should not be
overlooked, including pooling of park
and highway funds to acquire areas
along brooks, streams and natural
swales before they are plugged up and
despoiled by overbuildng. Wide modern
expressways require permanent drain-
age areas for surface water runoff.
These same areas should also be pre-

I do not advocate in this context 'niere-
ly another planning picnic. I do not
plead for green belts and parks as such,
nor for pretty pictures mirroring a ver-
dant future, but for long, patient, pain-
ful education of the public and for nego-
tiations with initially unenthusiastie
owners which lead finally to gifts, pur-
chases and other means Of acquisition
of remaining large open areas subject
to intermediate use and occupancy. In
pursuing this course I can promise you
toil and sweat, but not necessarily tears.

The owners, occupants and users of
large, unspoiled acreage, more and
more surrounded by minute subdivi-
sions and developments, cannot long
continue to 'pay mounting taxes. Usu-
ally they have lost interest in their
homes or clubs. The country squire’s
children in a rapidly changing commu-
nity want no bigr caravansaries and
manor houses, cannot afford a horde of
gardeners and other help even if they
can be hired, and have little sentimental
attachment to the old homestead. The

lots as weak zoning resolutions and
weaker local officials will permit, these
too have no roots down deep in the soil.
They constitute the uncertain and vari-
able human factors which hold the key
to the future, the factors which deter-
mine whether there will be adequate and
well located open spaces for public rec-
reation or one continuous, monotonous,
unbroken patchwork of identical bunga-
lows, split-levels, Cape COds, prefabs.

The suburbs grow because .people
want space tO bring up their families.
Inexperienced, weak and complacent lo-
cal OHicials neglect park needs until it
is too late. Middle income families move
out of the city to the suburbs because
they seek to escape urban blight and
congestion, only to create these very
curses in what used to be Open country.

Of the five boroughs in the city of
New York, there is no vacant land in
Manhattan, Staten Island is still not eas-
ily accessible; and Brooklyn, Queens
and the Bronx are practically filled up.
The same tragedy has befallen other
large cities, mitigated by frantic, bit-
terly contested, horribly expensive, last-
minute efforts to save what little is left

and to restore by demolition and clear-
ance the natural and logical Open spaces
which should never haveb‘be‘en "allowed

Early Official action and- general pub-
lic knowledge Of the future of large and
as yet unsubdivided private holdings in
burgeoning the suburbs would not only
guarantee future parks and playgrounds,
but also simplify all sorts of other local
public, quasi-public and _ private plan-
ning for houses, schools, churches,
drainage, sewage and sanitation, health,
hospitals, safety, utilities, transporta-
tion, streets and traffic.

This, then, is the challenge tO practi-

tioners of recreation. Let’s, over and

above the conventional approaches, get
hold of these clubs, big estates, truck
farms and other open spaces on the
basis Of immediate title and ultimate oc-
cupancy. What I advocate is not revo-
lutionary. I urge nothing extravagant;
only a little ingenuity, not great states-
manship, only a bit of prudence, not
hardship and sacrifice, only a look
ahead, not long-range vision; only an
eye to the next generation, if not be-
yond. Surely this is not too much to
expect of any progressive community
with pretensions to prudence, decent
standards and civic leadership. *

Skating Champion, which gives the reader some skating pointers.

Albright“ is speaking—blue-eyed,
sandy-haired Olympic women’s figure

course, she is talking about what she

thusiastically, “is that you’re really
playing on the ice. In the early stages,
playing is just as important as having
lessons because you get to feel at home
on the ice. That’s what skating is, being
at home on the ice.”

Skating involves the spontaneous ex-
pression of rhythmic movement inspired
by music. She says that ballroom danc-
ing is the nearest thing to it, even closer

than ballet, since there is no set routine
or steps to follow. L

Tenley does not expect to turn pro-
fessional. Doing the same combinations
of jumps, leaps and spins every night
would take away the spontaneity.

It’s fun that makes pe0ple take up
skating. When in Vienna in 1955, Ten-
ley was impressed to see how popular
skating can be as a recreation activity.
There, everybody does it. In the'mid-
le of one enormous outdoor rink is a
iant coatrack. Instead of 'st0pping off
at the corner drugstore on the way home
from school, children come to the rink,
put on their skates, hang up their coats,
nd go to it.

Try It Yourself

Another nice thing about figure
kating is that it doesn’t have to be ex-
ensive. All a person needs are skates,
cc, and the love for it. Tenley advises
5 follows:

The way to begin to skate is to attend
: few public sessions and get acquainted
ith the rink. Particularly in the be-

' inning, skating with other people is a
onderful thing. That’s the way to get
mto it.

Don’t be self-conscious, don’t be

5 fraid to fall, and remember that skat-
 ng makes friends. It is a companion-
' ble sport.

When you see others skating beauti-
ully, don’t forget that they were once
eginners, too. You can learn a lot from

atching others, noting their strong and

eak points. When there are top skaters

what others are doingin order to sharp-
en their own skill. ,Never be afraid to
try something. If you haven’t done it
before, all the better.

Beginners do not need more than one
professional lesson every other week.
The important thing is to digest what
you have learned. through practice be-
tween lessons. For beginners, group
lessons are excellent and cost as little
as two dollars an hour. [In some pro-
grams conducted by recreation depart-
ments they do not cost anything.———Ed.]

The way to progress and enjoy your-
self is to set a definite goal, give your-
self a deadline, and then attain it. “I
never go on the ice without having some—

“To be a champion in any line
of endeavor, you must be more

skillful than anybody else, and this
is an honor reserved for the few.

rive enjoyment from your chosen

adequate information, and a rea-
sonable amount of practice are all

thing in mind to work on,” Tenley says.
“It may be ust turning out my toes on
a step or having my hips flat to the ice
on a spiral turn. Map out what you are
going to do. As long as you know you
are accomplishing something, you feel
you are on the road.”

Almost every'rink has a skate shop
where skates of recommended quality
are sold. They should fit well, yet be
loose enough for wriggling the toes.
Leave the woolly socks at home. Tenley
wears mesh tights—with these the skates
can fit more like 'a glove than a shoe;

 

that’s the way it should be. “Skating
with heavy socks,” she says, “is like
playing the piano with gloves on.”

In regard to costume, shorts are bet-
ter for school figures so you can see the
tracings on the ice. Otherwise a short

- skirt and fitted waist with long sleeves,

make a good costume; or a skating skirt
and a sweater are nice.

With a moderate amount of consist-
ent skating, what can a beginner expect
to be able to do at the end of a year?
A great deal depends upon the person’s
attitude, but in a few months he should
be able to do simple spins, ice dancing,
simple jumps, and a spiral-—something
like a ballet arabesque. One of the most
exciting things to do is “combinations”
——~stringing three or four steps together
in a series.

Concerning technique, the skater
should “work with the ice, caressing it,
never fighting against it.” Timing is
important and the knee bend is vital.
It’s very easy not to bend the knee
enough; but Tenley insists that the knee
must lilt, bending both before and after
turns. That gives rhythm. She says,
“One of the most difficult things in
skating is the stop. You just have to
bend the knees, dig in and stop.” I

Unpointed toes are a pet peeve of this
champion from Newton Centre, Massa-
chusetts. Skating is like sculpture. If
the toe isn’t pointed, the line is off.

Tenley is sincere, genuine, and mod-
est, an excellent example of a young per-
son who has learned how to apply her-
self diligently and singlemindedly to a
worthwhile achievement and still has
fun in the process.

“Work hard, but don’t make hard
work of it,” is the advice she has fol-
lowed and passes on to others. *

An excellent example of the contribu-
tion which volunteers can make to the
success of a well-rounded program.

John E. DaPrano

fl‘uE third anniversary of a novel
volunteer-worker recreation pro-

gram will soon be celebrated by the St.

John and -St. Joseph Home for dislo-
cated children in Utica, New York. The

program was started in January 1954.
At the present time, an organized group
of thirty adults give their time and
energy to activities for approximately a
hundred boys and girls, ranging in age
from six to fourteen years.

The Catholic Order of Sisters of
Charity who staff the “home on the hill”
have recognized that play is as natural
to a chi'd as breathing and that through
play he grows physically, mentally, and
spiritually. They also knew that chil.
dren from broken homes and troubled
family situations, who have the greatest
need for emotional release, frequently
have little knowledge of games, sports,
and other forms of play. These chil-
dren are, as a rule, unhappy, insecure,
and emotionally upset.

To deal with these problems, a social
group worker was added to the stall,
to plan and administer a coordinated
rerrr-ation program geared to age and
intern-st levels. one person
cannot properly tend to the. needs of a

llouever.

hundred children, and the home, 3 Com-
munity Chest agency, could not finance
more than one paid leader.

The answer appeared to be the re-
cruitment of volunteer leaders, not by
any means a novel idea. Children living
in the home had seen volunteers pre-
viously, particularly around the holi-
days; but welcome as it is, such sporadic
activity is insufhcient.

A recruitment drive, consisting of
brief announcements made at various
civic and fraternal organization meet-
ings and in the local newspapers, was
started. Good character and availability
for one-hour-a-week service were the
only qualifications required of the pros-
pective leaders.

The twenty-five people who answered
the appeal had little or no eXperience in
either recreation or work with children.
They came from diverse occupations,
having in common only their enthu-
siasm and willingness to learn—plus, it
was learned later, an exceptional sense
of loyalty and stick-to-it-ness.

Initially, leaders worked alone and
brought their individual problems con-
cerning the program or the children to
tlw social group worker for solution.
Later the volunteers, at the suggestion of
flu ir hauler organized into a social unit

The preamble to the guild charter
“Tn the snirit of

states its purpose:

Christian charity . . . we volunteer our
personal services.” The guild aims are
simple: “To teach children by personal
example; to implant in children the con-
sciousness of individual dignity: to
show the love of God and neighbor.”
They proposed to further these aims “by
assisting the staff of the St. John and
St. Joseph Home in every way possible,

consistent with our individual capabili-F

ties and responsibilities.”

The organization of the guild served
other purposes. It provided a congenial
atmosphere for a free exchange of ideas
and problems concerning the children,
and it prompted periodic social activi-il
ties that bound members into a cohesive,

unit. The function of the guild did noj7

include raising money; its objective
were personal services only.

tobogganning and the ever-present cow-
boy and Indian games take over.

In summer, planned recreation is
similar to a playground day. It includes
games, swimming lessons, open swim-
ming, arts and crafts, hikes, intramural
sports such as baseball and softball, and
special weekly activities that include
races, greasy-pole stunts, doll parades,
and the usual playground stunts. The
day starts at 10 :00 A.M. with a flag-rais-
ing ceremony and ends at 8:30 P.M.

For the most part, volunteer leaders
supervise evening and week-end swim-
ming during the summer, but the high
points of their activities are overnight
camping trips that cover three to five
days each. These trips are made to the
surrounding state parks. Usually, two
adults accompany five boys on a camp-
ing trip. The home provides all the
necessary essentials, station wagon, tent,
sleeping bags, air mattresses, cookstove,
and other equipment. Ten such trips,
made last summer, led the campers from
the Finger Lake region to Thousand
Islands and Canada. Beyond a doubt,
these trips are easily the most exciting
of volunteer activities.

During the school year the fun is
centered indoors with only occasional
outside activities. Although the summer
program is more extensive, the school-
year program really reaches the zenith

DECEMBER 1956

of volunteer leadership. During this
time it includes basketball, soccer, foot-
ball, roller-skate hockey, quiet games,
photography club, radio club, rifle club,
woodwork shop, model classes, knitting,
Brownie program, general game periods,

' reading, folk dancing, and other activ-

ity. The groups are kept small to allow
leaders to give the children as much
individual attention as possible, but the
program can and does include every boy
and girl.

The children are divided into five age
groups. Zoe, the youngest girls group,

 

DePaul, the intermediate girls group,
Seton, the oldest girls group, St. Joseph,
the younger boys group, and St. Mi-
chael, the older boys group, have a full
program every day in the year. The ac-
companying chart gives a picture of
events during the school year.

There are some interesting by-prod-
ucts of the program. The choir has sung
on the local television and radio stations
and before various civic groups. The
boxing and wrestling teams have com-
peted with local boys clubs and have put
on exhibitions for civic and fraternal
organizations. Photography club mem-
bers make their own Christmas greeting
cards and the woodworking group has
made many useful items to give families
and relatives as gifts.

One might ask, “What are the effects
of such a recreation program?” It is
still too early to determine its far-reach-
ing effect. It is difficult, if not impos-
sible, for the volunteer leader to display
or encourage typical parent-child rela-
tions, but there is aiiman-to-child rela-
tionship that forces thefchildren to ad-
here to a code or standard pattern of
goodness, kindness and love. The fact
that adults will come to them week after
week, in spite of weather and other difii-
culties, impresses the children with the
sense of their own worth and takes away
some of the emotional strain caused by
the failure of their own family life. This
re-evaluation by the children of some
of life’s values could be the long-range
worth of the program. The short-range
value of the program is more apparent.

There is a better spirit among the chil-
dren. less bickering. less quarrelinrr.
more sharing. There is more friendli-
ness at play, more incentive to compete
with other children, more satisfaction in
living together.

Actually, the volunteer program is
only a complement of the program of
mutual living the institution staff pro-
vides. The staff has accepted the activity
program wholeheartedly for it has les-
sened and, in many cases, done away
with disciplinary problems.

For the individual leader, the pro-
gram ofiers an incentive to a richer
community life. He realizes that in giv-
ing he receives much more than he

gives, for it would be impossible in any
movement such as this to separate the
spiritual motives and rewards from
those that rise from purely humanistic
actions.

What is the future of the program?
Actually, the establishment of the guild
was a step to answer this question. With
the guild as a functioning, social or-
ganization, the door is left open to ac-
quire new members as present membprs
are forced to retire. It is conceivable
that when others leave there will always
be new faces to take their places.

Can this program be adapted to simi-
lar institutions, civic recreation pro-
grams, receation centers, and so on?

I believe it can. However, in institutions
similar to the St. John and St. Joseph
Home there is a certain advantage in
that the children are located in one cen-
tral area and the program can be better
controlled. Dependent children call
upon the best in pe0ple and as long as
there are dependent children there will
always be adults who are willing to sac-
rifice themselves to make these children
happy. Civic recreation programs and
civic centers pose a slightly different
problem because adults are also part of
these groups. However, the average
American with something to offer will
seldom refuse if the proposal to him out-
lines responsibility to his fellow men. '*

 

 

[41‘ THE CLOSE OF 1956, Marion Preece will conclude

eleven vigorous and fruitful years as a district field
representative for the National Recreation Association. Her
wish to retire from full-time active service is respected—
albeit with regret—by her many friends and professional
assoc1ates.

Her first field assignment with the Association was as dis-
trict representative in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.
Later she took over the same responsibilities in Kentucky,
North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, with district
headquarters in Washington, I). C. The Association’s files
contain extensive evidence of the remarkable advancement of
recreation in these states during the past decade, and of the
genErOUS testimony from lay and professional leaders of the
pistrict relative to the value of her services. The recreation
society in one of these states recently referred to her work as
giving the state “the forward look and hope” in recreation.
'l'hcse contributions on her part are the result of an unusual
backgroundof training and long experience in dealing with
practical problems in the field of recreation.

In addition to being a graduate of the University of Ne-
braska, Miss Preece’s education and professional training
included attendance at Iowa State Teachers College and at
one of the early recreation schools conducted by the National
Recreation Association. She (lid special graduate work at
Columbia University in dramatic literature and was, for
three years, manager of her own Community Pageantry

Service of plays, pageants and festivals in which entire towns
and counties participated.

Marion Preece has a profound and sympathetic under-
standing of the recreation interests and needs of children,
young people,rand adults. With marked imagination and
personal warmth, she is able quickly to bring"out of her
experience knowledge that is helpful to others. Significantly,
she works with people, not just for them. Tough problems
fail to daunt her courage or suppress her good humor. She
has assisted increasingly as a member of the Association’s
survey staff, serving as a consultant in the evaluation of local
program services. Happily she will continue to give part-
time help with this and other important tasks of the Asso-
c1at10n. ‘

Don Dyer, superintendent of recreation and adult educa-
tion in Milwaukee, said recently, “Her many friends in this
community wish her the full measure of happiness in the
leisure hours ahead which she has so meritoriously earned.”
All of us echo this sentiment—CHARLES E. REED, Director,

F ishing-Hunting Survey

Twenty-five million fishermen and
hunters spent $3,000,000,000 for 500,—
000,000 days of sport, and drove auto-
mobiles over 10,000,000,000 miles in
pursuit of this recreation during 1955.
These are notable findings of the first
national survey of fishing and hunting
in the United States, covered in a recent

government booklet, National Survey of
Fishing and Hunting, 1955.

The primary purpose of the survey
was to obtain nation-wide information
on the number of persons, twelve years
or older, who engaged in recreation fish-
ing or hunting during 1955, the number
of days on which they fished or hunted,
and the total amount of money spent in
these pursuits.

interest in the theatre and a willingness to work at it. Small
committees, with an average of four to six members, are
formed to take primary responsibility for play selection,
casting, publicity, and specific production needs. And it’s
an unwritten bylaw that all board members shall stand ready,
in an emergency, to pinch-hit for anyone from a dramatic
lead to a seamstress.

Membership development naturally stems from a smoothly
functioning background organization. The membership
campaign swings into action at the beginning of each season
and everyone interested in the theatre, regardless of capacity,
is urged to become an ardent salesman. Board members,
actors, make-up artists, designers, carpenters, and, again,
recreation department workers, vie with each other in con-
vincing more and more people that live theatre is glorious
entertainment. In addition to the many personal contacts, a
considerable amount of newspaper space is used, featuring
pictures of former productions and beguiling promises of
even greater delights during the season ahead—all for a
$2.50 season ticket!

The stimulation of “active” membership is largely a
matter of cordial public relations. Anyone having a good
time is apt to talk about it. And the person he talks to might
just happen to be a man who’s handy with a hammer or a
woman with a flair for costume design.

There is constant effort to make it clear that everyone who
wants to do anything will be accorded a rousing welcome,
and that people who’d like to be part of the fun (“But I’d
faint if I ever walked on stage i ”) can contribute just as much
by altering a hemline or finding the perfect coffee table for
the second act.

That’s the way this community theatre grew. For the first
twelve years there were no important changes except for the
constantly increasing membership. In 1948, the member-
ship of three thousand seemed to justify a great stride for-
ward—a full-time director. And it was a great stride for-
ward! Today, under the inspired and remarkably skillful
direction of Robert S. Quinn, graduate of the Goodman
Theatre School of Drama, the Community Players offer four
major productions €3.3ng iEach plays for five nights, and the
selection ranges er'ln classical drama to musical comedy.

The light balcony is occupied by a crew trained to han-
dle the complicated switchboard. Members must have
deep interest in theatre and willingness to work at it.

Does Sheboygan consider itself fortunate in having a
local theatre of such dimensions? There seems no doubt
about it! In March 1954, the Community Players became the
first organization in the city to receive a plaque “in recogni-
tion of outstanding community service” from the Wolf-Olson
Post, Veterans of Foreign Wars.

In May 1956, the Community Players merged with the
Sheboygan Civic Orchestra. The 1956-57 season offers

members three plays, a concert and a musical. *

N EXCITING program which offers
A youngsters instruction in basic ski-
ing techniques and safety measures is
making news in Utah and the West.
Under the sponsorship of the Salt Lake
County Recreation Department, some
three hundred school children are
learning the fundamentals of a winter
sport that will provide outdoor recrea-
tion for them throughout their adult
years.

Ideally located for the large-scale ski
instruction program, Salt Lake County
boasts some of the nation’s finest ski-
ing at its famous winter resorts—Brigh-
ton and Alta—which are only forty
minutes away from downtown Salt
Lake City. The program opened four
years ago when the county recreation
department received requests from
many parents in the area asking for ski
instruction for their children. The re-
sponse came quickly with the launching
of a free ski instruction program.

Prior to this, some free ski instruc-
tion had been provided by one of the
metropolitan newspapers in the form of
a course running through the month
prior to Christmas. Children who re-
ceived ski equipment at Christmastime
were, therefore, forced to learn the
sport on their own or wait a year until
the pre-Christmas ski instruction was
available again. The county recreation
department’s ski program now opens
early in January and continues through
eight consecutive Saturdays. This not
only gives the children a chance to learn
how to handle their new equipment, but
provides additional instruction for
those who may have participated in the
earlier ski program.

Brighton, with its line beginning and
intermediate slopes, was selected as the
site for the department’s program.
Early each Saturday morning during
the course, chartered buses pick up the
children at selected stops throughout
Salt Lake City and County. Upon ar-
riving at the ski resort, the children are
placed in classes, ranging in size from
ten to fourteen, under the direction
of the K. Smith Ski Schonl and its staff

of certified ski instructors. Two hours
of instruction in skiing safety and tech-
nique is given the young, beginning
and intermediate skiers. Rides on the
rope tow, T-bar and chair lift are free
during class hours when the children
are with an instructor.

After the two-hour instruction class
is over, the children have two additional
hours in which to eat lunch and prac-
tice the techniques they have learned
in class. Early in 1956 the department
began using a unique device to provide
additional safety for the youngsters
during the free ski hours. Each instruc-
tor now “tags” his charges with a tow
badge indicating which of the three lifts
and hills the youngster is capable of
tackling. The individual lift operators
COOperate by sending the children to the
proper lift. In addition, all hills are
regularly inspected by ski patrolmen
who are on the lookout for danger.

At the end of the eight-week program,
a “graduation day” is held on the

slopes for the children who have com- T‘

plelcd the course“ Each child is given
a small medal which indicates by colOr
and lettering how far he hasprogressed
in skiing wsnowplow, stem Christi, and
so on. 

r ‘
lhc program has been deemed a suc-

cess by parents, children, instructors
and the county recreation department.
Fifty children took the course during
its first year. Since that time it has
grown steadily to two hundred in 1955
and three hundred in 1956.

“I can’t think of a better way to spend
the taxpayer’s money than for a pro-
gram which provides instruction and
safety in a sport which children can
enjoy now and in their adult years,”
says Laurine M. Mickelsen, a county
recreation supervisor and director of
the department’s ski program.

“I might never have had a chance to
learn skiing if it hadn’t been for the
county recreation,” says one youngster.
“Neither of my parents ski, and I’d
have had to wait until I was old enough
to go skiing alone before I’d have
learned.”

Ski instructor Dennis C. Temple ob-
serves, “The county program has
greatly increased skiing safety among
beginners. The number of skiing mis-
haps among these supervised beginners
is definitely much lower than among a
comparable unsupervised number.”

The program is restricted to children
still in school. The department feels
that free adult instruction would com-
pete with private ski instruction avail-
able in the area. Seventy-five per cent
of the children who take part in the ski
instruction program are of junior-high-
school age. The remaining twenty-five
per cent are from the high schools and
grade schools of Salt Lake County.

The department concentrates its at-
tention on beginning and intermediate
skiers in the belief that they are more
in need of instruction in safety and
technique than are the advanced skiers.
Full cost of the program is assumed by
the recreation department with the ex-
ception of the round-trip bus fare of

$1.50 per child.
Although Salt Lake City has the ad-

vantage of being one of the few metro-
politan areas where good skiing is only
minutes away, there are numerous areas
where a small-scale free ski instruction
program might work well. Salt Lake
County has been very pleased with its
program and plans to continue it. As
a». result of this experiment in winter
recreation, hundreds of youngsters are
learning an outdoor sport they can en-

A SIX-FUNK) Walm

From a Far East Service Club came the idea for a giant wreath—nnot just for a door or win-

dow, but for a really spectacular wall decoratim, inside or out. It’s not too late to make it

if you assemble the greens or other natural materials common to your section of the country
( check the conservation list before cutting any greens), pile them up in the lounge, class or

clubroom, and let everybody get into the act.

Materials Needed: Greens such as magnolia branches, smi-
lax, galax, pine, spruce, hemlock, fir, arbor vitae, laurel,
rhododendron, princess pine, ground pine, and so on—leave
six-inch stems if possible. Nine feet of thirty-six inch chicken
wire. Lightweight, pliable wire for wiring greens and decor-
ations to wreath. Fifteen large red Christmas balls, or two
dozen smaller ones (ping-pong or plastic foam balls, painted,

are usable), to suggest holly berries. One yard of bright red
oilcloth (ribbon or crepe paper could be used, but won’t
have the “body” of oilcloth) . Four medium-sized screw eyes
and picture wire for hanging wreath. Wire snippers and
stapler. .

Directions: Cut the piece of chicken wire lengthwise into
strips, each eighteen inches wide. Cut each of these strips in
two to make one six-foot and one three-foot length.

Wire the four pieces into a square frame (1) . “Dog-ear”
the corners to the back of the frame and wire them securely
in place (2). Now you have a strong, lightweight back-
ground and can start the real work!

Weave the stems of the greens through the chicken wire.
If stems aren’t long enough, you may need to use lightweight
wire to secure them. Several different varieties of greens
may be used to give variations in color and texture. Fill in
any bare spots until the wreath is a lovely, solid green (3) .

Fasten groups of three large red Christmas balls together
with wire; then tie the group securely into the wreath,
through the wire. Spot them where they’ll look the prettiest,
saving space at the bottom of the wreath for a big how (4).

For the bow, out the oilcloth into three twelve-inch wide
Strips. Make two big loops for the bow out of two of the

nn‘t‘wunvo 10:6

lengths and staple the ends together at the center of how. Cut
the other length in two and staple to the loops to make the
streamers. Fasten bow securely to wreath with wire.

To fasten to wall, place four screw eyes where you want
the wreath to hang. Run a length of picture wire through
each of the four doguears, twist securely, and run it through
a screw eye. These hold the wreath in place by all four

 

outside “corners.”

This wreath is lovely in its natural green and red; how-
ever, if you prefer, it may be sprayed, and other colors may
be used for the balls and the bow to fit your color scheme
or background color of the wall.

Variations

Flat Tree—Make basic chicken wire base in the shape of a
triangle with two sides longer than the third side. Fill in
with greens (in the same manner as for the wreath) ; attach
to wall, adding a piece of bark [or the trunk, and a square,
rectangular, or tub-shaped piece of oilcloth or colored paper
for the base. Decorate as desired. This type of tree is espe-
cially practical and effective for a small room where floor
space is limited

Star—Make basic form of five triangular pieces of chicken
wire attached to pentagon-shaped center. Cover with greens
and spray lightly with gold paint. Add gold or colored balls.
Borders—Use strips of chicken wire covered with greens for
window valances, for around doors, as frames for large holi-
day pictures, trim for pillars, and so on.
Cornucopias—Fasten together two sides (right-angled) .of
a square of chicken Wire to form a cone. Cover outside W1th

greens. Use as a holder—hanging on a wall or door, lying on

a table or shelf—for small gifts, brightly colored ornaments,
flowers, or fruit. *

nHELP RAISING" Teenf-Agers

F lorida youngsters apply their energy to serving their
community. They do a lot of good and wm status.

..

IN STRIKINC contrast with the kind of Omega, inspired by the occasion, an-

“hell raising” that is putting teen-
agers on the front pages these days, a
remarkable trend is developing among
the youth in one of the major recreation
agencies in the Greater Miami area.
The “thing to do” and increasingly the
way to gain the respect of other teen-
age groups—among the thirty-seven
clubs of high-school age sponsored by
the Greater Miami Jewish Community
Center at five different locations in
Dade County— is what has popularly
come to be known as “community serv-
ice wor .”

Picked up by the professional staff
of this agency as a beginning trend—a
straw in the wind—that had been start-
ed in a modest way by a few groups, it
was noticed that there was an interest
in such things as learning about com-
munity services, raising funds for char-
itable causes, helping to cheer up hos-
pitalized people, and so on. In the few
cases where groups had attempted ac-
tivities of this type, it became evident
that they were achieving a substantial
respect from other teen-agers for
having attempted something that was
commonly the domain of the adult com-
munity—and what was more, that they
had succeeded at it.

Striking out boldly in this direction
on a large scale with all its groups, the
center used the idea as the main theme
for the first annual conclave of its teen-
age clubs. The keynote of this gather-
ing, attended by over two hundred
youth delegates, was “Teen-Agers Take
Their Place in Community Life.” Un-
dcrstanding the community and how
young people could make a contribu-
tion to that community was the con-
ference’s major emphasis.

The decision to “accent the positive”
in youth work paid off immediately
when one of the clubs, Tau Alpha

488

nounced that it would present a trophy
at the end of the school year to the
group that did the most in community
service work. With the help of the cen-
ter, this group set up a point system for
rating the community work of the vari-
ous clubs, counting such factors as the
number of participants in a given pro-
j ect, the nature of the work, the number
of hours spent, and other items.
Further stimulation was provided by

 

was exciting and rewarding. What is
most important, they discovered a
brand new answer to the constant ado-
lescent search for acceptance and ’rec-
ognition by adults. In effect, they were
saying to the adult community and its
organized efforts for charitable work,
“We are going to try our hand at this
game and do as well or even better than
you at it.”

Perhaps an important key to the feel-

Emanuel Tropp

ing that has been generated is that each
club makes its own independent deci-
sions about which projects to under-
take and how to go about them, without
adult pressure or demands. The results
of the first year of this organized youth
effort were so astounding that it may
genuinely be questioned as to how
many adult groups can match the rec-
ord of some of the more active teen-
age organizations. While statistics
alone cannot begin to tell the story of
the spirit and significance behind this
activity, the facts are eye-Openers them-
selves.

In a detailed survey by the Greater
Miami Jewish Community Center,
twenty-six of its teen-age clubs were re-
ported as participants in a total of 147

 Singing Christmas Tree

Turn your Christmas chorus into something just a little
different! A few platforms—piled one on top of the other
in a pyramid—are the base for arranging your chorus
group into the form of a living Christmas tree. This is
especially effective with children of eight to fifteen years
old. Larger children form the lower branches of the tree;
and the tiniest child should be on the top. The chorus could
be dressed in white and should wear appropriate head deco-
rations. The tiniest child, at the top of the tree, should wear
a more elaborate head decoration. (From an idea used by
the Scott Community Center, Huntington, West Virginia.)

 . C
a}; Creative Productions

Following the singing Christmas tree chorus a production
of “The Little Stranger”* might be appropriate and effec-
tive. It is an ideal story to use for a creative dramatic pres-
entation. The children act out the story as it is told by a
narrator; or lines may be improvised if and when necessary.

“The Little Stranger” is a Christmas legend about a poor
woodcutter, his wife and two children who lived on the edge
of a great forest. On a cold and wintry night, while a storm
was raging outside, the woodcutter and his family were just
beginning their evening meal. Suddenly they heard a knock
at their door. The woodcutter went to the door and, open-
ing it, found a small child there, who said, “I’m a poor child.
Please let me in for I have nothing to eat and no place to go.”

The woodcutter brought the child in, and when the child
had been fed he went to sleep with the other children. Dur-
ing the night the woodcutter’s little girl was awakened by
what seemed to be singing. When she looked out of the
window she saw the little stranger who had come to their
home—and he was standing in the snow, no longer in rags
but beautifully dressed. The rest of the family was awakened
by the singing, and they too were very surprised to find
the little stranger dressed so elegantly. Suddenly the child
exclaimed, “I am the Christkind (Christ Child), bringing
happiness to good children. I shall bring you a blessing.
This little fir tree outside the window shall be my emblem.”
They looked at their tree and found that it was covered now
with nuts, lights, apples and threads of gold.

Another appropriate and delightful story which could be

used as a creative dramatics production is “The Carol That
Never Was Sung.” ' ’

Each year a chorus of little angels gave a Christmas con-
cert and each year the littlest angel was late, and the con-
cert had to start without him. Every year the leader hoped

that the little angel would arrive before the concert was over‘
so he could sing his carol which, incidentally, he had been‘
preparing the whole year. But, no, he always arrived just
as the concert ended. When asked by the leader why he
was late, he always answered, “I hurried as fast as pos-
sible—but next year I promise to be on time.” And every
year he continued to be too late.‘

The little angel was reprimanded and warned year after
year. Finally one year the leader decided to be very stern
and demanded the reason for his tardiness through the
years. Reluctantly the little angel confessed that he always
started in time, but each year on his way he heard of a poor
blind man who needed help, or a little child hungry and
cold with no one to care for him, or a family sick and in
distress, who needed cheering. . . .

When he finally finished all the reasons which had de-
tained him over all the years, he said, “I hurried as fast as
possible—but next year I promise to be on time.”

The leader smiled, shook his head and said, “Little Angel,
you will never be on time to sing your carol; that is, not

until the world has no more sorrow, distress or grief. Yours
is the perfect song.”

g Teen-Ager Gift Center l

Many communities now have an annual Christmas activ--
ity which particularly belongs to the teen-ager. (See “Teens

I
Gave Oyster Bay Its Holiday Look,” RECREATION, Decem-

ber, 1953).

A teen-age gift center, consisting of collected or craft-
shop-made Christmas gifts, could be a very exciting and
interesting project, especially when the proceeds are to be
used as a Christmas gift from the teen-age volunteer work-
ers. The money earned could be used to give a very special
Christmas party for the golden-age group in the community
or some other activity of this type.

If the teen-agers make the gifts which are to be sold in
the gift center, so much the better; however, if time doesnit
permit the craft work this season, they can be responsible
for collecting the gifts from helpful and interested coni-
munity people and local tradesmen with the idea of en-
larging their project in 1957. *7 ‘

A Municipal Report

 

Wt: OWE people a report of our stew-
ardship of their business.” That,

according to the mayor in a town of
just over five thousand people, is the
soundest reason for the making of a
yearly report on municipal operations
to the pe0ple of the city. '

Apparently many city oflicials in com-
munities of much larger and smaller
size feel the same way. The Government
Public Relations Association estimates
that, of the two thousand five hundred
cities with five thousand or more peo-
ple, one thousand provided a municipal
report to citizens for 1954-55—c0n-
servatively thirty-three per cent more
than the number of cities reporting for
the previous year. Of the one thousand,
about one-third published reports, the
others reached citizens via radio, tele-
vision, films, slides, or special talks.

While information is not tabulated
on reporting by cities with less than five
thousand population, experience in'sev-
eral states has been that the smaller
cities are the best reporters, due, per-
haps, to the feeling, as one Tennessee
town oflicial expressed it, “In a little
town everybody thinks he knows what
the government is up to and usually gets
it all wrong. A report can correct mis-
information.”

Forms for a Report

There are a number of ways which
city oflicials have found effective in re-
porting to citizens. The booklet- or mag-
azine-type report is the most usual. It
may he mimeographed, multilithed, or
printed. lt ranges in size from about
four by six inches to eleven-and-a-half
by fourteen inches (Life-size), from
four to forty-eight pages (more is too
long) and costs from four cents to one
dollar per unit.

Pan Dodd Wheeler-

 

The folder is popular ..for cities of
medium and smaller size. It is one sheet
or a double sheet which folds, typically,
to letter size and has an address side for
mailing as is, or folds to fit a large busi-
ness enveIOpe. Costs range from one to

twenty-five cents per unit.

The newspaper report—a half- or full-
page, or a special “supplement”—has
become popular in the past five years.
Cities pay regular advertising rates
for the space and, if the 1955 experience
of the city of Milwaukee is typical, re-
ceive “excellent cooperation and serv-
ice from the newspaper staffs” which,
in Milwaukee, provided editorial assist-
ance, layout and drawings, and other-
wise helped make the report a fine one.
The Milwaukee report, a handsome,
multi-colored supplement, cost two-and-
a-half cents per delivered copy. (The
unit cost goes up, of course, in a small-

er community where newspaper circu-
lation is smaller.)

A report may be in the form of a per-
sonal letter which summarizes for citi-
zens—in a brief, friendly, informal way
——what the city has done and is doing.

The letter can be mimeographed or
printed.

Radio programs and TV presenta-
tions can be successful reporting media
but these require specialized professional
services. Where the radio or TV sta-
tion is prepared to provide help, a dra-
matic series (involving one family and
its dealings with the city) or a straight
information presentation (where one
department or unit of government is fca-
tured on each program of a series) can
prove effective in telling the city’s story.

Like the former, a series of slides (for
presentation with live narrative) or the
more elaborate filmstrip require profes-
sional know-how. In one city, the police

photographic lab has taken the pictures
for a slide series showing what the city
has done and where. In Patchogue, New I
York, amateur cameramen pooled their
equipment to film the story of their city
government—the village paying only
for the cost of film. The film is in black
and white and narration is provided by
the person showing the film.

Finally, the address by a public ofii-
cial is still a good reporting media, but
is more effective when reinforced by a
printed report or enlivened with use of
slides or film. The address, however,
reaches a limited number of peeple.

What to Report

Regardless of format or purpose of
the report, there is certain information
which should be included:
Identification—The name of the city,
the state, the period of time the report
covers and the month and year in which ‘
the report is being presented. "
Vital Statistics—Estimated population, I
tax rate, total assessed valuation, narra-
tive or graphic explanation of how the
city is organized, location of ofiices of
the city government, place and time of
meetings of the legislative body.
Operations—Listing of major accom- '
plishments of the city during the period ' I
covered (capital improvements, expan-
sion or extension of service, or creation

  
 
    
  
  

of new service, and major legislation).
Finances—Statement of general fund
income and expenditures, of the city’s _,
assets and some analysis of debt of the‘ :
city and how it is being repaid. 3
Aims—What the city h0pes to accom- '
plish over a given period of time.

Many municipal reports also include: 7

departmental details, municipal deve10p-
ment (planning, zoning, annexation),
directory information (such as a listing
of citizen groups, when they meet and
Where; listing of all city ofiicials, phone
numbers to call for city services).

How to Report

Someone must be reSponsible for get-
ting together information for the mu-
nicipal report, writing it or seeing that
it is written, and arranging for its pre-
sentation.

This person may be the mayor or
manager, or an individual or a commit-
tee named by the mayor or manager.
The individual is sometimes a member
of the city staff, sometimes a private
individual with ability to do this kind
of work. The committee may be com-
posed of city personnel, or citizens, or
both. In cities where there is a public
relations unit or an oflicial charged with
public relations' duties, the unit or indi-
vidual official is the “report editor.” He
is responsible for:

0 Collecting data for the report from
an ofiicial in the case of the smaller city
or from unit- or department heads .in
larger cities. This may be done by use
of questionnaire forms which city per-
sonnel fill in or by requesting a memo
summarizing activities and appropriate
information from city’personnel.

03 Checking the city Scrapbook (and
every city hall needs one) ; newspaper
files; a listing of legislation; inter-de-
partment reports; and minutes of coun-
cil meetings.

0 Writing the report or seeing that it

is written. Handling the collection of
pictures and art work. Doing a layout
or seeing that it is done, preparing a
working script or speech (depending on
the type of report being issued) and see—
ing that the municipal report reaches the
place of presentation (printer, radio
station, TV studios, and so on).

0 Arranging for the details of presenta-
tion (proofreading, rehearsals, so on).
o Arranging for distribution (actual
program presentation or distribution of
publications, promotion of report).

Report Writing

Report writing takes writing skill and
some understanding of what a munici-
pal report is all about. Looking at and
reading through reportsofrom other
cities is helpful to the writer. The re-
port writer should:

Be simple! Just pin it down—short
words, short sentences, short para-
graphs.

Be interesting! Don’t tell everything
about the city government—just what
you think the reader wants to know and
needs to know.

Be vivid! If a picture or chart can be
used—and will illustrate better than
anything you can write-nuse it. _
Be accurate! Check your facts. If you
use names, include first name, middle
initial, and last name—-——correctly Spelled
(or correctly pronounced).

Be truthful! Use creative ability to de-.
cide on a theme for the municipal re-
port and to tell the story well—but don’t
create facts or wrong impressions.
Whatever the format or content, citizen

reports must be geared—in presentation,
point of view, language, and illustration
—to the “man on the street.”

Why Report?

Sound reasons, from the point of View
of municipal ofiicials, for the making of
a report to citizens are based on the
experience in one state where reporting
has become wideSpread in the past four
years. Their reasons for reporting:

City officials owe an accounting to
citizens: “We are responsible to the peo-
ple for running the biggest business
around here . . . the town government.”
People need a factual summary of city
Operations: “Citizens get most of their
information about the city . . . from the
newspapers . . . in daily chunks. In a
municipal report,- the work of the city
is summarized so that people get an
over-all picture . . . factually and accur-
ately.”

Paves way for needed municipal pro-
jects: “We have been ordered to build a
sewage disposal plant. We . . . had to
bring citizens up to date . . . to tell peo-
ple about our dilemma.”

Boosts citizen and city hall morale:
“A good report boosts citizen morale
about the town, increases respect for the
work oflicials do, and provides incentive
to city ofiicials to do a better job.”

Tones up cooperative spirit of citi-

‘ zens: “Our leading banker has said that

. ‘when city ofiicials are willing to
take citizens in as partners in running
the city, a new spirit of cooperation on
the part of businessmen and citizens is

.LONG-RANGE COUNTY BECBEATION PLAN

 

Mercer County, New Jersey, which includes Trenton, the
state capital, is prepared to move forward toward the kind
of long-range integrated recreation program that is imper-
ative today in a rapidly growing industrial and residential
area. It is the result of a professional study initiated and
sponsored by the county board of freeholders which de-
cided that, without further delay, the people of the county
should face their recreation problems and project a defi-
nite county-wide plan for solving them. The far-reaching
and long-view recommendations drawn from the study,
made by the National Recreation Association, are significant.

First, they present a well-defined procedure for meeting
specific needs through the responsible governing authority
and citizens of Trenton and the thirteen townships which
comprise the county. The study found all the communities
within the county deficient in play space. It specified the
amount of park and other recreation acreage each needs for

DECEMBER 1956

playground, playfields, swimming pools and other facilities.
Major emphasis was placed on acquisition of land for these
purposes while it is still available at low cost. The type of
organization for the county and the respective localities, the
importance of integrated planning by school, recreation and
park agencies, and cooperation by public and private agen-
cies in over-all recreation program planning, were specified
in the recommendations.

The long-range county plan was received enthusiastically
at a county-wide meeting in October of two hundred and
fifty county, city and township oflicials and key representa-
tive citizens. The attendant publicity and county-wide in-
terest has already led a public-spirited county resident to
offer the board of county freeholders a tract of seventy-five
acres which he preferred to withhold from commercial
development in order that it may be utilized as a public

park. *

ECREATION, like a stream of water,
has a tendency to take the course
of least resistance. It is much easier to
establish recreation programs and de-
partments in cities, because more
money is available and the need is more
apparent. In the rural community, not
as much money is available—rather,
the means of obtaining it are not pres-
ent—and the need not as apparent, but
need for leisure-time activity is just as
great. Recreation gatherings in a rural
community are often the very basis for
the development and progress of its
people. .
The rural family may have plenty of
outdoors and often a lake or pond in
its backyard, yet its members are far
from their neighbors. 0n the other
hand the city dweller has neighbors in
his backyard, yet is far from forests
or lakes.

In both cases, human nature requires
diversion from normal routine. This
is where recreation comes into the pic-
ture. As visualized by a group of South
Carolina citizens, after much study and
thought, this need resulted in a plan
presented to the legislative delegation
of Aiken County. As a result, the Aiken
County Recreation Commission was
organized, in July 1954, “to develop
recreation programs throughout the en-
tire county.”

Aiken County has several types of
communities: industrial ones made up
of textile workers, a large government
atomic energy plant, and a large agri-
cultural area. The difference in these
areas necessitates different types of or-
ganization.

First of all, the purpose of the county
recreation commission is to help each
and every community develop its own
program. In incorporated towns and
cities, a'local department has been, or
is in the process of being, established
with proper legislative support. The
commission, working with the National
Recreation Association, is able to sug-
gest the best type of legislation from
surveys made by the Association
throughoutjhe country. Once the in-
corporated town has the proper legisla-

“Here, the need is as great
but not so apparent.”

tion, an appropriate budget, and has
hired a recreation director, its recrea-
tion department functions on its own.
However, some of its activities are co—
ordinated by the county recreation
department.

In industrial communities, the de-
partment works with the industries
which have their own facilities and pro-
grams. If the industries do not have
such a program, the department sets
up committees composed of volunteers,
just as in a rural community, and ac-
tivities are coordinated with the rural
and city programs.

Finally, in the county’s rural sections
in unincorporated communities, seven-
member volunteer committees are set
up. These seven members usually rep-
resent all. factions of the community
and are interested in all age groups in
the community. The size of the area
one committee serves depends entirely
upon the community situation. If the
people over a wide area are acquainted

and normally work together, then one
committee could serve a large area.

However, in areas where houses are so
sparsely situated that only a few fam-
ilies know each other and work to-

gether,- it would be necessary to have
more committees.

The seven members of the committee
are the chairman, a secretary-treasurer,
a men’s activities chairman, a women’s
activities chairman, a boys’ activities
chairman, a girls’ activities chairman,
a community organization chairman.

Each of these chairmen may recruit
other community people to serve on his
special subcommittee. Each subcom-
mittee is responsible for taking the ini-
tiative in its own division; however, the

Joseph V. White

other subcommittees pitch in to help as
needed.

The purpose of the community or-
ganization subcommittee is to bring
various civic clubs and church groups
that have a program of their own into
contact with the community committee;
and the chairman of this subcommittee
may have serving with him a represent-
ative from each of the churches or civic
organizations.

This is the general setup and basis
upon which all volunteer committees
are organized. The degree or extent of
the organization depends entirely upon
the community situation.

Each community is responsible for
developing its own facilities under pro-
fessional guidance of the county rec-
reation department. Land and the
equipment are owned by the volunteer
committee. The county claims title only
to land beneficial to the entire county,
such as that used for roadside parks.

The communities obtain money in
many and various ways to finance their
facilities. Some launch campaigns un—
der the direction of the county depart-
ment; some hold money-making activi-
ties; some have paid memberships; and
some use facilities of other organiza-
tions on a cooperative basis.

Volunteer and city recreation work-
ers plan the county program. First of
all, each community meets and plans
its own activity for the 'year. Then all
the various chairmen meet with the

county commission and present their‘

program suggestions. One community

may ask for a county-wide horseshoef

tournament; then the other communi-

ties will be asked if they are interested.

tournament is scheduled,” each commu-

nity holding its own preliminary tour-
nament. Activities are emphasized on
the local level. County-wide tourna-
ments are held as an incentive for local
tournaments.

Volunteers need constant training
and encouragement in order to retain
interest. They become discouraged if
one or two things are not as successful
as they think they should be; therefore
they need constant contact with the pro-
fessional worker.

Aiken County is divided into three
districts, and during the summer
months there is a professional worker
for each. They are called program su-
pervisors and are responsible for coor-
dinating each town in their district into
the over-all county program. In most
cases the county has to start and con-
duct a program until the community
is thoroughly sold on it. Once this hap-
pens volunteers take over at the request
of the local committee chairman. The
local committee is the governing body

as far as recreation is concerned and
the county respects its jurisdiction and
decisions.

The county recreation department
issues a monthly bulletin containing ac-
tivity schedules, training announce-
ments, and items of interest about vol-
unteer leaders in the county. Each local
chairman submits to the department
the names of persons he would like on
the bulletin mailing list. This gives
everyone a sense of belonging and a
special interest not only in his local pro-
gram but the over-all county program.

Many things have been accomplished
in Aiken County. A volunteer commit-
tee in Gloverville, working with the
county department, managed to obtain
a surplus school building; then —
throughp town meetings, which are the
initial tool of the county recreation de-
partment—it interested citizens of the
town in donating time, labor, and
money to build a community center.
Another community, Montmorenci, ob-

tained land and built, in cooperation
with church groups, a playground
adjacent to the church. The men built
swing sets and other playground and
picnic equipment“in their spare time,
calling upon the pipefitters, the REA,
and other sources for help.

Once the bandwagon begins to roll
everyone pitches in to help. Now, after
only a year and a half, there are eight-
een organized communities. Increased
interest indicates that the surface has
been only scratched, although every
crook and corner of the county is
covered..

The county recreation commission is
proud that the boy on the farm has as
much “opportunity to do things as a boy
in town, and the boy in town has the op-
portunity to enjoy the country through
coordinated county-wide activities. The
end result will mean stronger bodies,
sharper minds, better neighbors—also
more prosperous towns and communi-

ties. *

Dancing for pre-school children, aged four to five.

 

DECEMBER 1956

' Creative Arts Group

NOT VERY MANY children in West Orange, New Jersey, can avail
themselves of the splendid programs sponsored by the Newark
Junior Museum, and so a creative arts group was started in 1954 by
local women as a nonprofit community project. They believed that,
“Each person is an individual with unique creative powers; and that
a creative arts program will awaken and develop ingenuity, imagina-
tion, and growth.”

With the help of Frank Moran, commissioner of the recreation
department, and Milton W. Brown, superintendent of schools, they
set up—after school hours in two elementary schools—a six-week ex-
perimental program in the fields of creative art and creative dancing.
One hundred and twenty-six children were enrolled at a cost of six
dollars each, per series, to cover eXpenses.

The program has now been expanded to a twenty-seven-week
schedule, and music has been added. Fifteen different classes are
located in five strategic areas of town, in keeping with the original
plan of making the classes accessible to as many children as possible.
In response to the very heavy demand, one adult class in creative
dancing is also offered. Eventually classes will be offered to junior-
high-school students. Dr. Moran has supplied the materials and equip-
ment while Dr. Brown and all West Orange school principals have
made public schools available for the program. *

Control District. As a result, a full-
scale program will ultimately offer rec-
reation opportunities to over one and a
half million people in the lower south-
eastern third‘ of the state. For the flood
control district plans to undertake a se-
ries of surveys leading to a logical pro-
gram for recreation use of its projects
and facilities. By 1957 or ’58, a won-
derland for hunting, fishing, boating,
and hiking should be in existence.

The Central and Southern Florida
Flood Control District is a joint federal-
state project covering 15,600 square
miles of terrain. It consists of all or
part of seventeen counties and extends
from the citrus areas on the north to the
highly urbanized areas along the Atlan-
tic coast. Included within the district
are the St. Johns, Kissimmee, and Caloo-
sahatchee Rivers, Lake Okeechobee,“
the Everglades, and the famous “Gold
Coast” (extending from Palm Beach
to Miami). The project itself consists
of a series of canals to drain off the
excess waters which normally come in
late summer and early fall, three reser-
voir areas that will he larger than Lake
Okeechobee when completed, and levees
designed to protect the agricultural
area around Lake Okeechobee and
cities along the coast. Altogether, it
is calculated, the total cost will he
slightly in excess of $2,000,000.

The responsibilities of the project
are divided between the governing
board of the district and the US. Corps

of Engineers. The corps has the duty
to construct all project works and the
district secures the rights of way, pro-
tects the United States against damage
claims, and maintains completed works.
Together, and with local participation,
they plan the development piogram.
Ultimately, of course, when all'project
works are completed, the corps will no
longer participate actively.

Until 1955, the flood control authori-
ties devoted most of their attention to
their primary goals of flood control,
water conservation, and protection
against salt-water intrusion. Two rea-
sons undoubtedly dictated this course
of action: the governing board did not
wish to undertake any activity that
might interfere with these goals, and
the State of Florida had no over-all rec-
reation agency or director.

The change in attitude was the re-
sult of several factors. First, as a very
practical matter, certain developments
within the district indicated a need for
an organized recreation program.
Splendid opportunities for hunting,
fishing, and boating within the district,
deSpite any oflicial program, began to
attract thousands of people. Urban
residents along the Atlantic coast began
to use district canals with or without
district approval. Moreover, commer-
cial operators, quick to take advantage
of the situation, began to establish con-
cessions for boat rentals, bait, fuels,
and the like. On weekends, thousands
of people swarmed over district terri-
tory to hunt, fish, and go boating.
Where “posted” signs were present,
visitors either tore them down, ignored
them, or burned them as firewood. It
would have required a police force of
substantial size and exorbitant cost to

prevent this. Moreover, the district did
not want to prevent use of its proper-

ties; it sympathized with the people’s
desire to use them; and it recognized
that it was a public agency, supported
in large part by the taxes of its recrea-
tion-minded visitors. Yet, uncoordi-
nated use of district facilities by people
seeking recreation pleasures disrupted
many of the district’s aims. The dilem-
ma was simply this: the irresistible de-
mand to use the area for recreation by
citizens of southeast Florida and the
necessity to protect the district in fulfill-
ing its primary tasks.

Moreover, recreation groups, such as
fishing and hunting clubs, and news-
papers in the area began to level criti-
cism at the entire project, though it
was‘evident that district inactivity in
recreation planning was the chief cause
of complaint. In time, then, district
officials realized that public acceptance
for its flood control, salt-water intru-
sion and drought prevention programs
hinged, to an extent, on its ability to

l

satisfy the people who desired use of 3

district facilities for recreation.
Studies of other comparable projects

such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, '
the Muskingum Conservancy District '

in Ohio, and various U.S. Corps of En-

gineers reservoir projects further indi- '

cated the need for a recreation pro- '

gram. Each had had experiences similar
to that of the Central and Southern
Florida Flood Control District, and
each had developed a program. Granted
they had gone their separate ways later

trict and the corps have maintained
more public facilities and more rigid

controls. Nevertheless, they had de- .

their primary function, also engaged in

the function of recreation.

The Florida agency found that the
State of Florida, fabulous as it was as
a pleasure resort area, had no recrea-
tion agency ;;-no one .in the state was
charged with over-all planning and im-
plementation of a recreation program.
The district could not avoid its task by

355*“ | 

shunting it to some agency located in
Tallahassee. Had such an agency ex-
isted, the flood control district could
have relied on the state agency to take
over the recreation phase of its pro-
gram. They could have pointed to some-

. one else responsible for seeing that

proper provisions were made, even
though there always would have been
problems connected with the coordina-
tion of district primary aims and state
agency_recreation plans;

Therefore, the flood control district
has decided to develop a program.
Spurred on bylipegsistent demands,
thwarted by lack of any state agency
to assist them, and haunted by the ex-
perience of other projects, the district

has no other course of action. It in-
tends, initially, to develop a master plan
to serve three purposes: provide the
necessary data about needs and re-
sources for recreation; establish re-
sponsibility for all federal, state, local,
private, and district recreation activi-
ties in the area; lay out an action pro-
gram to provide, among other matters,
rules and regulations, administrative
actions, and the like. Once the master
plan has been completed—it is hoped
it can be done in a year—the district
will begin its actual implementation.
The final result should provide recrea-
tion under a coordinated plan for an
area covering approximately one-third

of Florida. *

Research in Today’s Leadership

ACCORDING to the findings, there is
more found out about leadership
in one single year now than has been
accumulativer discovered since the
presidency of Abraham Lincoln. As the
science of administration advances on
four frontiers, research is identifying
special areas of exploration.

First, in the theory of organization
the frontier lies in the study of the con-
cept of integration. The General Elec-
tric Company now divides the funda-
mental operations in group manage—
ment into (1) planning, (2) organiz-
ing, (3) integrating, (4) measuring.

Second, in the practice of ad-
ministration the frontier lies in the
study of decision-making. Peter Druck-
er (Future of Industrial Man and Prac-
tice of Management) says that in the
next twenty years the emphasis in man-
agement will be on the understanding
of the process of how to make choices.

Third, in the field of supervision the
frontier lies in the area of ejfective
communication. The American Man-
agement Association says, “In the final
analysis, the job of every executive or
supervisor is communication. The av-
erage manager or supervisor spends up
to ninety per cent of his time in com-
municating, one way or another.”

Fourth, in the field of leadership, the
frontier lies in the concern for motiva-
tion. The question is: How can the
building of a climate take place which
makes men want to create and want to
achieve? How can a group culture he
deveIOped which generates within itself

creasing knowledge and continuing

The Person of the Leader. These four
areas come into operational focus in
the person of the leader. Hence, inquiry
into the nature of leadership becomes a
core concern. Leadership research, con-
servatively estimated at some ten mil-
lion dollars a year, and leadership train-
ing experience combine to support the
following statements:

' The principles of leadership can be
conceptualized and can be taught.

' “Managers and supervisors can be and
are being developed.

° The principles of creative thinking—
and perhaps this is most important—-
can be conceptualized and are being
successfully taught. Creative thinking
is now as much a content subject as
musical composition, where theoretical
knowledge finds expression in perform-
ance.

In a study of supervisors, Norman R.
F. Maier found that trained leaders suc-
ceeded in getting ninety-five per cent
of the workers to accept an approved
work method, while untrained leaders
are scarcely half as successful.

A group of engineers from The Car-
borundum Company took a course in
creative thinking at the University of
Buffalo to test the productivity of group
versus solo thinking. One test team

Paul F. Douglass

jointly brainstormed the problem by
means of group thinking. Another test
team attacked the problem as individ-
uals. The group method produced forty-
four per cent more worthwhile ideas
than the solo method.

Everywhere research piles up evi-
dence to show that high .production re-
sults from the activity of creative teams
which respect and emphasize the worth
and growth of the human being. These
findings stem neither from academic
theorizing nor from religious dreams.
Harold F. Smiddy, vice-president of
General Electric Management Consul-
tation Services, says that these ideas do
not come from “academic adventures in
a philosophic ivory tower,” but rather
“from a measurable equity” which stems
from the “cold and factual experiences
of business and industrial leadership.”

The new concept of productive man is
nowhere defined more clearly than in
studies of supervision. At the Univer-
sity of Michigan Institute for Social
Research they are trying to discover the
principles of organizational structure
and leadership practices responsible for
high productivity coupled with job sat-

isfaction. They find that employee-

centered supervision is more productive
of goods and job satisfaction than pro-
duction-centered supervision.

Close supervision tends to be asso-
ciated with lower productivity and gen-
eral supervision with higher productiv-
ity. High productivity makes produc-
tion the by-product of creative teams
which respect and emphasize the worth
of human beings.

People. Studies identify certain fun-
damental and human and spiritual
qualities in the interpersonal structure
of industrial organization necessary for
a high production. Work groups with
high group-loyalty and morale exhibit
more teamwork and more mutual help-
fulness.

studies of the characteristics of produc-
tive interrelationships, research work-
ers are pointing to the hunger for affili-
ation. The roots of this urge lie deep
within the nature of man. The dynam-
ics of human relationships have 'been
described in terms of three movements:
moving toward people; moving against
people; moving away from people.

Dr. J. L. Moreno (Psychodrama and
The Group Approach in Psychodrama)
classified the basic attitudes which peo-
ple show toward one another as attrac-
tion, repulsion, and indifference. Now,
Donald and Eleanor Laird (Technique
of Handling People) reduce to three
the prime considerations and reactions
of followers and leaders: anxiety, hos-
tility, utilization of group forces. The
last is a power which cancels anxiety
and rules out hostility. Productive lead-
ership is recognizing the desire of
human being for creative afiiliation.
Industrial man, working on a team,
produces best when:

° His dignity and feelings as a person
are respected.
° He is helped to do his very best.
° He is honestly a member of a team.

At the Harvard Research Center in
Altruistic Integration and Creativity it
has been emphasized that meaningful
and productive interaction among per-
sons occurs when the aspirations and
aims of one person are shared and
helped in their realization by others.

Dr. Gordon Allport, head of the psy-
chology department at Harvard Univer-
sity, reports similar findings to show
that man is basically eager for friendly
affiliations and friendly relationships
with his fellow man under conditions
which respect his own sense of integrity
and self-esteem.

The Successful Leader. A leader, so
studies show further, possesses two
types of competence. First, technical

DECEMBER 1956

skill and, second, skill in interpersonal
relationships. Both skills can be sharp-
ened by in-service training.

Colonel Bernard 5. Waterman says
bluntly that leadership consists of two
parts: “knowing your stuff. or technical
proficiency which helps you to find the
right goal; and the human skill to get
people to want to do their best.”

Donald and Eleanor Laird have tried
to summarize the general principles of
a successful leader: first, he inspires
a member to group activity; second, he
helps his group to reach their goal;
third, he coordinates orients. and helns
the members to fit into the group, he
is interested in the group; and, fourth,
he is human and approachable.

Types. The type of leader who
achieves results releases the maximum
power of the group. He is not a boss.
It is perfectly- clear that the boss is a
production-centered operator. He dic-
tates plans and makes decisions and the
reaction on the part of the group mem-
bers is that they tend to become his
slaves—obedient, dependent, often re-
sentful, and frequently grumbling.

The next type of leader is also an
overseer, production-centered. The
overseer cares for people’s welfare so-
licitously. Group members become
complacent, unresourceful, unimagina-
tive and acquiescent routineers.

The productive type of leadership, on
the other hand, is the leader who is per-
son-centered, employee-centered, who
releases the human potential, encour-
armq reaction and participation. Group
members, therefore, grow in initiative,
responsibility, productivity, and a
sense of personal worth.

Basic to this type of catalytic leader-
ship is the concept of how we make use
of conflict. One way of dealing with
the differences among peonle is, first
of all, by domination, in which victory
goes to one side, defeat to the other,
often crystallizing a resehtment into
revenge. The next way is by arithmetic,
taking a vote, decision by the numbers
racket. The third way is to compromise.
This way each-side gives up something
it values and trades it for something it
can accept. The fourth way is by crea-
tive integration.

Companies like General Electric and
General Motors are saying now that
creative integration in the internal

groups of management, where some-
thing more emerges, is the most impor-
tant way and that where the problem
cannot be solved by discussion and per-
suasion the manager and supervisor
fail.

The Problem-Centered Group. This

is the meeting ground of individuals
and a society. A problem is brought
into focus and discussed. In group
thinking the group multiplier goes to
work as the result of the discussion
process which includes:

° Exploration from all the difierent
points of view of the different people
in the group.

° Analysis, where the members take
the situation apart. Analysis unfreezes
opinions and opens minds to new ideas.
° A synthesis, where the group puts the
program together and organizes a pat-
tern of functional actions,'so the prod-
uct of the group and members is some-
thing new and something larger than
was originally the case.

In every conference group, in every
type of group thinking, there is need
for deve10ped skills. These must be ma-
ture conference skills—-- and are the
most important task of the supervisor
—functional participant skills to en-
courage each member to give his best
and to bring out the best in others.

Functional Skills. In every group
there must be somebody who communi-
cates enthusiasm, the proposer who
brings in an idea to be discussed. This
idea may be perfectly clear to the pro-
poser while to the other people it may
be completely new. Therefore, there
needs to be a clarifier. There needs to
be an eXplorer. There needs to be a
mediator, a man who weighs the evi-
dence, a man who formulates the think-

This year saw the largest attendance
ever at the NRA Congress section on
“Recreation for the 111 and Handi-
capped”——over four hundred at the dif-
ferent meetings.

The first “Professional
Preparation for Hospital Recreation
Personnel,” was chaired by Dr. Charles
K. Briglltbill of the University of Illi-
nois. The summary of the meeting in
the Congress Proceedings“ will note
the differences of opinion among the
various people and colleges involved.

The next speaker, on “International
Health and the Re-Creation of Man,”
was Dr. John Hanlon, chief of the Pub-
lic Health Division of the International
Cooperation Administration. He told
how his organization has assisted pro-
grams in forty-four countries with the
help of over four hundred health tech-
nicians. He said continued widespread
prevalence of preventable disease is a
major determent to economic deve10p-
ment and political stability. Malaria is
the number one killer in the world.

After this talk, three concurrent
workshops were held and each was
jammed. They were: “Recreation for
Geriatric Patients,” “Recreation for the
Mentally Retarded,” and “Recreation
for the 111 Child.”

The chairman of the geriatric work-
shop was the extremely capable Geneva
Mathiasen of the National Social Wel-
fare Assembly, with a notable panel of
experts. They emphasized that activ-

productive. High morale and high pro-
duction come as by-products of team-
work patterns which place the work of
man. a respect for his dignity, a con-
cern for his growth at the center of the
industrial and group process.

Such is the spiritual discovery of the
hardest boiled research of our decade
which says that leadership is the group
process by which people who feel free

and are responsible pursue goals to
which they dedicate their hearts and
commit their energies. .The leader gives
information and help and enthusiasm.
This will encourage each man to
think his best, speak his best, do his
best, and be his best at the point of the
common problem. Such leadership cat-
alyzes change, builds healthy groups.

pitals and homes for the aged. What
good are all the wonder drugs if no
activities are made available for those
now so much better able to be active?

The workshop for recreation for the
mentally retarded was the first of its
kind. Dr. Elizabeth Boggs, education
chairman of the National Association
for Retarded Children, l'éd a discussion
group composed of authorities from
several countries.

Dr. Maurice E. Linden, director of
the Philadelphia Division of Mental
Health, explained how the use of tran-
quilizing drugs is changing the pattern
of care in mental institutions. Thou-
sands of patients, formerly regarded
as custodial and hopeless cases, now
can be included in activities programs.
Hospital administrators report that par-
ticipation in all forms of recreation has
increased fifty to five hundred per cent.

Mentally ill persons, for many years
confined to drab locked wards, now en-
gage in sports, games, and supervised
and unsupervised group play. Many
locked wards are being opened daily, in
increasing numbers. .

It was amazing to learn of all that
is being done internationally. Again I
advise you to buy a copy of Congress
Proceedings to learn of other countries’
contributions to the ill and handi-
capped. To quote Donald Wilson, sec-
retary general, International Society
for the Welfare of Cripples: “In my
travels in different parts of the world,
one of the saddest things I observe is
the large number of boys and girls con-
fined to hospital beds with nothing to
do to keep their minds occupied. Al-
though they receive excellent medical
care. it frequently occurs to me that

Beatrice H. Hill

the improvement of their physicalwell-
being is offset by damage to their per-
sonality because/of these enforced years
of inactivity.

“Professional people in the field of
recreation have a specific responsi-
bility, not only to develop a high quality
of service in their own communities,
but also to share the benefits of their
experience with other pe0ple through-
out the world. It is only through this
process of sharing that we can make
certain that our professional responsi-
bilities will be met.”

Four concurrent “New Ideas Work-
sh0ps” featured outstanding people in
the field of music, drama, social activi-
ties, and arts and crafts.

Marian Chace, dance therapist at
Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washing-
ton, D. C., chaired the meeting on “The
Recreation and Therapeutic Benefits of
Dance.” In her inspiring talk, she em- J
phasized: “Dance is a natural means of
communication rather than an artificial ,
one, as we sometimes are blinded from ‘
seeing because of our cultural pattern
of comparative stillness and our at-
tempts to communicate almost entirely
on a verbal level. Dance is not valuable
for the ill and handicapped because of .
the illness but in spite of it, because it
is a basic form of expression for peo-
ple in general.”

The meetings concluded with a“Tour
of the U.S.A.” via song and instru-
ments, given by thirty wheelchair and
stretcher-borne patients from Goldwa-
ter Memorial Hospital in New York
City. Over four hundred people heard
their enthusiastic voices and roared
their approval—~—a rousing climax to our
final section. *

“How many there are who have lost
opportunities for good jobs simply be-
cause they were indifferent about the
way they tried to explain their quali-
fications, because they failed to express
in appropriate words their best accom-
plishments (good deeds) as proof of

their abilities. A careless letter of ap-
plication or a poor presentation has lost
many a man a chance of improving his
employment."-—-Newsletter to Students,
Massachusetts Department of Educa—
tion, Division of University Extension,

April 1956.

Why Field Work?

“The prime value of field work for
the recreation major lies in the oppor-
tunity it offers for self-evaluation and a
sane acceptance of his abilities and
shortcomings before he steps into the
professional world.” This was written
by Olivette Trevannion while a recre-
ation student at San Jose State College,
California. “On The Campus” will be
happy to receive other similar brief
statements on the value of student field
experience from students.

Favorite Recreations

An informal poll of senior recreation
majors at three colleges reveals that
sports activities—mostly team sports——
lead the list of things these students
choose to do in their free time. Both
men and women mentioned sports most
often, then music, in interviews with
NRA representatives. ,

Activities ranged from geology to tax-
idermy, and from hi-fi to gymnastics.
Among other “traditional” activities
mentioned were camping, nature and
hiking,“ and arts and crafts.

Conspicuous by their omission were
social activities, dancing, and dramatics
for men. Few women mentioned inter-
est in outdoor group activities or dra-
matics. They shared with men a low
identification level for reading as per-
sonal recreation.

Tennessee Offers New Degree

A bachelor’s degree in recreation
leadership and administration will be
awarded by the University of Tennes-
see, according to a report from Profes-
sor A. W. Hobt. The departments of
sociology and physical education and
recreation are cooperating in the new
major. Of the one hundred and ninety-
four quarter hours listed, twenty-two
are elective. Seventeen of these quar-
ter-hours must be in the liberal arts.

Illinois Members—98% "

Ninety-eight per cent of the upper-
class recreation majors at the Univer-
sity of Illinois now are enrolled as NBA
Associate Members under the special
student’s plan, reports Charles Bright-
bill, curriculum director.

Field WOrk Assignments

The Saint Paul (Minnesota) Recrea-
tion Bureau, in its latest annual report,
discusses its cooperation with the Uni-
versity of Minnesota and Hamline Uni-
versity in recreation field work. Thirty-
two students placed through the volun-
teer bureau gave sixty hours’iservice
each per quarter.

Recreation bureau supervisors visited
the two universities at the beginning of
each quarter to interview students
and to assign them to centers. Consid-
eration was given to: where the student
could get the experience he wanted;
supervision and facilities available to
assist the student; distance and travel
involved for the student; opportunities
at the center for the student; and help
the student could give the recreation
bureau program.

Seven objectives for students were:

1. To learn to understand boys and
girls both individually and in groups
in an informal setting.

2. To develop leadership skills.

3. To contribute to individuals and
to a movement for the welfare of others.

4. To appraise personal aptitudes in
working with others.

5. To recognize recreation activities9
part in the growth of children.

6. To understand the institution in
relation to those it serves.

7. To observe techniques used by
professional recreation leaders and vol-
unteers. *

Paul F. Douglass. Association Press,
291 Broadway, New York 7. Pp. 174.
$4.00.

Dr. Douglass made a speech on lead-
crship at the International Congress
which was a howling success. That is
why we have reprinted it in this issue
1; see page 498). Now, most of the ma-
terial used in that address is in this
book, only in much fuller form—even
the sketches that he used as slides.

Although his book is addressed to
church leaders, it might ust as well be
addressed to community recreation
leaders in hospitals or in any other situ-
ation, even business, for it is a funda-
mental book on leadership today, pre-
senting the findings and conclusions of
recent research in this subject. In non-
technical language, thinking of the
church as a group workshop, he explains
group dynamics, the theory and me-
chanics of group experience, ways of
teaching, and conditions favorable to
adult learning.

Fun for Parties and Programs‘i‘

Catherine L. Allen. Prentice Hall,

lnc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Pp.
146. $3.95.

Those who attended the Congress in
Philadelphia this year will remember
Catherine Allen’s fine leadership of
games at the party demonstration ses-
sion. Now, you will want to see her

newly published book on the subject.
' Its title is misleading, for actually this
book is an excellent primer for the so-
ial recreation leader, presenting basic
'- techniques of leadership, as well as in-
’ structions for the planning and leading
of a well-selected variety of social rec-
reation activities. Many of the latter
will be familiar to the experienced lead-
er, but their presentation here may be
different. Many of these are well known,
but have a new slant.

The author writes in her preface,
.“The best loved tunes and activities

presented in simple arrangements or
with clear-cut, step-by-step directions.
From the easily performed, pleasantly

remembered activities . . . [the book]
moves to the more creative, more chal-
lenging and advanced areas, where the
participants—now secure in the group
—Can express themselves and enjoy re-
ciprocal good will.”

The first section, on social recreation
methods, covers the meaning of social
recreation, the member-of—the-group
leader, the planning leader and director-
leader, and specialized techniques. The
second section covers social recreation
materials. Says Dr. Allen, “Activities
are the ‘materials’ of social recreation.
They are the games, dances, stunts,
songs, and other types of recreation
which are fun to do in groups.” The
third and fourth sections cover sample
party plans, and supplementary mate-
rial, suggesting homemade equipment,
sources of free and inexpensive mate-
rials, bibliography, and index of games
and activities.

Catherine Allen has done a splendid
job, and her book belongs on every so-
cial recreation leader’s toolshelf. It is
especially a boon to the new or volun-
teer leader.

Fun with Puppets

Sylvia Cassell. Broadman Press, 127
Ninth Avenue, North, Nashville 3,
Tennessee. Leader's edition, pp. 113,
$2.25; regular edition, pp. 87, $1.50.

The leader’s edition includes a sup-
plement on “Puppetry in Religious Ed-
ucation.” This section is well devel-
oped and oifers techniques equally ap-
plicable to the school or recreation cen-
ter. However, we can’t help but feel
that the Easter story is not a good choice
for amateur puppetry. Perhaps it could
maintain its solemn and sorrowful at-
mosphere in the hands of experts, but
it would surely lose much in the hands
of children, no matter how seriously
thr“r try-

The remainder of the book, except
for this supplement, is full of clever
ideas for simple puppets, many types of
simple stages, and directions for inter-
esting, easy sets, scenery, and so on. The

discussion of how to dramatize a story
is excellent. This book could be used

successfully by untrained leaders and
offers excellent opportunities for intro-
ducing puppetry into the recreation pro-
gram.—V irgin ia M usselman, N RA Pro-
gram Service.

For those who stage their own plays,
make their own sets, with or without
special training, this book should be a
mine of ideas and information. Em-
phasis is laid upon necessities and prac-
tical suggestions “for creating an illu-
sion of reality” for a few hours. The first
chapter covers the staging of plays in
early Greek, Roman, Italian and Eng-
lish theatres, although this is not a his-
tory. Other chapters cover: the frame-
work, curtain settings, constructing
scenery, designing settings, painting
scenery, presentation, production, plus
a glossary of materials and sundries and
a bibliography.

Miss Lambourne was for some years
a tutor in the training department of the
British Drama League and is now a
visiting lecturer at the Academy of Dra-
matic Art. This and her previous book.
Dressing the Play, are both in the pub-
lisher’s “The How-To-Do-lt Series.”

This account of the experiences of a
U.S. park ranger and his wife, currently
stationed in Olympic National Park.
Washington, has made the best-seller
list. It is wonderful publicity for our
national parks, their well-trained per-
sonnel and, incidentally, the need for
care in relation to fire, playing with the“
wild animals, and so on.

The story is entertaining and reads-
like a novel, from their wedding trip up
the narrow mountain road to today
when Bill is training young, green men
l and their wives) in the ways and tra-
ditions of the rangers and their type of
service. It is a challenging and an ex-
citing life, calling for a man of alert«
ness, fortitude and courage.

The book is sometimes exciting, some-
times funny, and always interesting. It
would make a good Christmas gift, par-
ticularly for anyone who likes an ad-
venture story or loves life in the open
or in the deep forests of the mountains.
