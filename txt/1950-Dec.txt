still air sparkling with particles of frost,
snow squeaking underfoot; and all the trees
are Christmas trees. Fun outside, fun in-

RECREATION

EDITORIAL

What Recreation Means

o The opera house lies
silent for a quivering mo-
ment while the last cre-
scendo is absorbed into the
darkness——then there
breaks forth a rush of ap-
plause as if the hearts of
the audience must return
the passion of the last scene. Up from the bottom
of every soul comes a community of joy, purging,
thrilling and satisfying the wish of every man to
be a noble creature.

The parish hall of a downtown city parish is
alive—wriggling forms swarm over a wrestling
mat; the air whirrs; the floors bounce in rhythm
with the rope skippers; and, down at the end,
the older ones dance, swaying to another rhythm.
Quietly the babies eye the movement; while the
elders talk and smile and duck the bouncing ball.
They feel different; they leave much happier.

Two men sit by a campfire in the rain and con-
tentedly eat meat from a can. They shiver; they
ache. They can look forward to no relief for their
discomfort until the sun bakes the dampness of
their clothes. And yet, beneath the pain of the
evening is an underlying sense of well-being and
a feeling of reunion with the natural world of
wind and weather, of earth and water.

Or watch the gaiety of a boys’ baseball game, the
peaceful chatter of old women as they sew, or the
warmth of a square dance. All these and many
more scenes you have known. All these and many
more are recreation. Recreation—being made
again, born again. Recreation—living for the mo-
ment in the happy innocence of doing for the sake
of doing, playing for the sake of playing, laughing
for laughter’s sake, crying because it does not hurt
to cry for the sake of crying. Recreation—letting
the inner desires flood up unchecked. Recreation
—being yourself and liking it. A hundred persons
can say what recreation means and never know
what it means to the next person, because its mean-
ing lies outside the realm of ideas and words.

Recreation lies between the physical, emotional
and the mental, intellectual. It is quite literally
good for the soul, speaking in religious terms.
It is therapy foi' the neurotic pressures of the sub-
conscious, speaking in psychiatric terms. It is hy-
gienic, speaking in medical terms. But this sense

 

DECEMBER 1950

Reverend Paul Moore, Jr.

of physical and mental well-being, the beauty of
activity which rests, and of rest which is produc-
tive, go beyond the terms of a field of study. Look
back on your last time of recreation. Look at the
world as it appeared before you played, graying
and dying as it lagged past; then look again at the
world afterwards, when through freshened eyes its
tempo quickened and with brighter colors danced a
livelier tune. Recreation is in the person who
plays and, for him, its meaning comes in a change
in the meaning of other things. The meaning of
his job may change as he plays a game with his
fellow workers. His family may seem suddenly
different after a trip to the beach. The meaning
of his marriage or even of his God may change
because now, once again awake, once again him-
self, he looks clear at the world.

But recreation does not stop with the individual.
The idea of community and of willing dependence
one upon the other springs up beautifully through
the agency of play. You have often seen a number
of individuals, separated by the barriers of shyness
and hostility, change in a few minutes into a group
which feels the warmth of being together in a
moment of enjoyment. Communities can be built
by recreation, and the larger community of the
nation rests upon these smaller foundations. And
so it is that the nation and the world can be de-
veloped or perverted and destroyed through the
use of the inner desires which find free play in
recreational activity.

In fact, it may be that in the center of reality
itself lies what we call recreation. For the Chris-
tian, at least, joy is among the highest of Virtues
because it is godly. And down through the strands
of traditional theology come thoughts of the ter-
rible laughter of God, of the high vision of God’s
joy in being God. A professor of mine used to say,
“God has a wonderful time just being God.” No
other satisfactory reason for Creation comescto
mind except that it was an overflow of the. Joy
of Ultimate Being. Joy is in the nature of things,
streaming through the world with the healing of its
bright movement and finding its channels wherever
men turn aside from necessity to open themselves
for a moment to the warm splendor of happiness.

O A SURVEY of the natural resources development
possibilities of New England and New York State
has been ordered by President Truman. This is
to be started “as soon as possible” by a temporary
interagency committee made up of the Depart—
ments of Interior, Army, Agriculture and Com—
merce, the Federal Security Agency and the Fed-
eral Power Commission. Letters also have been
sent to the governors of the seven states to be
covered, asking each to appoint a representative to
act in liaison with the federal group.

O A DIRECTORY of field service personnel of na-
tional agencies is being assembled by the National
Social ‘Welfare Assembly, and will be ready in a
couple of months. Its purpose is to let the com-
munity know what services are available locally.

0 UNDER CLASSIFICATION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, the
Supreme Court recently virtually commanded the
Florida Supreme Court to reverse a ruling that a
Negro could play golf on a city-owned course only
one day a week. In its order, the Supreme Court
directed “reconsideration in the light of” a June
decision assuring two Negroes equal opportuni-
ties With whites at the Universities of Texas and
Oklahoma, respectively.

0 RENTING MUNICIPAL PROPERTY to private in-
dividuals has caused an Ohio court to hold that the
Cleveland Municipal Stadium and its four parking
lots are subject to property taxes since they are
not “used exclusively for any public purpose.”

0 RESULTS OF A RECREATION POSITION SURVEY of
Hospital Workers, conducted by the Standards
Committee of the Hospital Section of the Ameri-
can Recreation Society, now completed, state that
“apparently recreation workers in military and
Veterans’ Administration hospitals are working
much nearer to the ideal situation than recreation
personnel working under other administrations.”

Recreation in National Emergency

0 RECREATION CONSTRUCTION CONTROL, as set
up on October 27, 1950, when the National Pro-
duction Authority issued its Order M-4 restricting
practically all types of recreation, amusement and
entertainment construction—from community rec-
reation buildings to gambling establishments, was
immediately and vigorously protested by the Na-
tional Recreation Association. The protest, as
filed by the association, was against the assump—

348

tion that no distinction is being made between such
things as race tracks, slot machines and night
Clubs and such facilities as community recreation
buildings, athletic field structures and swimming
pools. The association expressed a strong convic—
tion that community recreation has a vital part to
play in the defense effort, supporting its position
by quoting Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Harry S. Truman and leading authorities in the
armed forces, industry and labor. The associa—
tion’s original protest has been followed up by
further conferences with the National Production
Authority and others; and every effort is being
made to secure a general exception from the order
for all community recreation agencies, public and
private.

9 A NATIONAL DEFENSE FUND has been organized
by the National Social Welfare Assembly and
Community Chests and Councils of America, in
response to a generally-expressed desire that a
coordinated presentation of national defense service
needs be made to local communities. The National
Recreation Association has been recognized as
the national voluntary agency providing service
and leadership to public and community-wide rec—
reation agencies; and a budget for theispecial de-
fense recreation services of the association, in 1951,

has already been approved by the budget arm of
the National Defense Aid Fund.

0 THE RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE OF the Na-
tional Recreation Association are being made
available On recreation problems which arise in the
promotion of the defense program, after several
conferences with representatives of the National
Security Resources Security Board. The associa-
tion has prepared special material for the board,
including suggested standards for recreation facili-
ties in emergency shelter camps and in emergency
housing and community facilities. It also has pre-
pared, for the Civil Defense thce of the board,
an outline of ways in which the recreation move-
ment in the country can cooperate in Civil defense,
which has been approved.

The 1951 National Recreation Congress

will be held in Boston, Massachusetts.

The 1950 Mideentury Recreation Congress

A SPIRIT OF EXPECTANCY, of the beginning of a
new era in recreation, of many good things
just around the corner, marked the recent National
Recreation Congress, October 2 to 6, in Cleveland.
The midcentury mark had been reached and all
eyes turned to the years ahead. As Joseph Prender-
gast, executive director of the National Recre-
ation Association, pointed out when referring to
the development and use of recreation resources
in America, in his opening talk on Monday eve-
ning, “The years before 1900 were the years of
awakening, of exploration and of experimentation;
the years between 1900 and 1950 have been years
of preparation, of philosophizing, of foundation
laying; the next fifty years will be the years of
building, of accomplishment, of fulfillment.”
Attendance surpassed itself, running pretty close
to fifteen hundred delegates, and it seemed, at

DECEMBER 1950

 

7% 2mm

times, that the Statler Hotel headquarters must
burst at the seams. Several international repre-
sentatives were able to attend this year—there be-
ing seventeen from Canada, six from Germany,
two from South Africa and one from India. Some
of the states were distinguished by notably large
attendance, being led by Ohio, of course, with one
hundred fifty-two delegates, and followed by New
York State with one hundred fourteen. Registra-
tion figures show that among others well-repre-
sented were Michigan with seventy-eight dele-
gates; Pennsylvania with seventy-seven ; Illinois
with fifty-three; District of Columbia with forty-
six; New Jersey with thirty-six; Indiana with
thirty-three; West Virginia with twenty-seven;
Wisconsin with twenty-six; North Carolina and
Florida with twenty—five each; Maryland, Massa-
chusetts and Missouri with twenty-four each; Vir-

349

ginia with twenty-three; California with twenty-
one; and Alabama and Texas with twenty each.
Further figures point up the interesting fact that
other far-away states did very well, indeed.

Opening day saw the usual bustling about in the
process of getting settled, the hearty greetings,
registering, location of meeting rooms, consulta-
tion desk and room, press room, offices and so on.
New, better and gayer Congress badges were the
order of the day. Printed in large, easily readable
type, each sported a colored ribbon designating the
district from whence its wearer came. Therefore,
folks had an easier time getting acquainted and
finding each other.

Exhibitors were ready with their interesting and
colorful recreation diSplays long before the crowd
poured in—and it’s good that they were, for the
hordes of visitors who seemed to materialize out of
nowhere, and to be everywhere, gave them little, if
any, chance for further preparation. The over-all
exhibit was the largest yet, scores of these dis-
plays filling the Pine Room and Euclid Ballroom
of the hotel. The Pepsi—Cola and Coca-Cola booths
played hosts, dispensing free bottles of refreshing
drinks, and were the stopping-off place for grate-
ful throngs. Many of the displays were particu-
larly attractive and new this year, some showing
motion pictures or colored slides. Educational ex-
hibits were arranged by recreation departments
and agencies. An excellent model airplane exhibit
took up the space of two booths; other exhibits
displayed a galaxy of arts and crafts, books, ping-
pong tables, playground equipment, various kinds
of balls and bats, woven wire tennis nets—designed
to stand all weather with no maintenance, swim-
ming pool facilities, folk dance records. Two of
the foremost folk dance authorities were on hand to
answer questions, as were all exhibitors. The scene
was bright with merry-go—rounds, slides, picnic
stoves, and so on. In addition, exhibitors arranged

for broadcasts of the World Series games in the
exhibit rooms.

The Cleveland Local Arrangements Committee,
under chairmanship of Floyd Rowe, as thought-
ful hosts, established a booth in the Pine Room so
that they could be ready at hand to give utmost
cooperation in getting things under way and in
carrying through to the end with many of the small
details which make a congress click. Local volun-
teers not only made a real contribution to the
smooth running of the meeting, but also to the
entertainment of the visitors to their city.

This year, in addition to the consultation bureau
display of association-printed materials, where

350

orders were taken, and of the scrapbooks of ma-
terial on various recreation interests which are
available from other organizations, the National
Recreation Association also presented a new and
arresting display of its community work across the
United States. This consisted of a series of large
maps—one of each state—showing, by means of
gaily-colored pins, the distribution of those locali-
ties receiving services and publications from the
association. Conveniently situated near the desk
for the new associate and affiliate memberships in
the association—a point of great interest—the maps
were easily accessible to delegates wishing to check
up on the spread of activity in their own and other
states.

The press room hummed with the usual hurry
of fresh news, and press representatives were made
welcome at all sessions, including the banquet.
All during the week, many delegates appeared on
radio and television programs, thus helping effec-
tively to spread the message of the Congress
throughout the country. In this connection, the
Congress was- also covered by all wire services and
by special correspondents from out-of—town papers.

Talks at Evening Sessions

 

In officially opening the Congress on Monday
evening, Thomas E. Rivers, assistant executive
director of the association and secretary of the
Congress for many years, presented the Reverend
Paul Moore, In, chairman of the evening and first
vice—president of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation. It was his first Congress. Said Mr.
Rivers: “In the history of the association, one of
the first talks in New York on the problem of
recreation was given at the home of Paul Moore’s
grandmother, Mrs. William H. Moore. At that
time, Mrs. Moore became deeply interested in the
work of the association, and this interest eventually
expanded into the establishing of family support
that has continued for three generations, to be
exemplified in her grandson at the midcentury
mark.” The Reverend Paul Moore has served as
a member of the board of directors of the associa—
tion for four years. His excellent talk, opened by
the reading of the letter of greeting from President

RECREATION

Truman, and his introduction of Joseph Prender-
gast, will long be warmly remembered. (The Rev-
erend Paul Moore, Jr. has written the editorial for
this issue of RECREATION.-——Ed.)

Mr. Prendergast, the principal speaker of the
evening, discarded his carefully-written speech
while on the platform and gave an extemporaneous
and moving talk on “The Next Fifty Years in
Recreation.” Delegates were aware that he ap-
proached his subject with freshness and objectivity
and, that through his eyes, there is much that can

be learned.

Having just returned from a full swing around
the country, and from talking with hundreds of
recreation leaders in a wide variety of areas, situa-
tions and agencies, he could give an over-all pic-
ture of what has been accomplished and what
needs to be done in recreation. He stressed the
tremendous importance of teamwork in the task
before us during the next fifty years. “A nation—
wide program,” said Joseph Prendergast, “is not
a program that can be prepared or carried out by
any one agency of government. It will take the
best efforts of all of us doing our own special jobs
to the best of our ability and cooperating whole—
heartedly and unselfisth with all others in the
field of recreation.”

He recommended that we must continue to im-
prove, strengthen and expand our local recreation
systems, emphasizing the need for more coopera-
tion on the local level between all public and private
agencies concerned with recreation; that each
state’s responsibility should be to provide such
recreation areas, facilities and services as will meet,
with reasonable accuracy, the needs of its own
people who are not the responsibility of either the
political subdivision of the state or of the Federal
Government and that each should continue to
expand and improve these services; and that the
Federal Inter-Agency Committee on Recreation
should be strengthened and expanded in its ca-
pacity as a clearing house for the Federal agencies
concerned with recreation and in its endeavor to
clarify the proper responsibilities of the govern-
ment in this field. “Under our American demo-
cratic way of life,” he asserted, “all individuals,
all groups and associations interested in recreation
should participate in the task of carrying out the
suggested program.”

Toastmaster at the banquet meeting in the Grand
Ballroom on Tuesday was Otto T. Mallery, chair-
man of the National Recreation Association Board
of Directors and well-known and loved for his long
service to Philadelphia recreation.

declared that it is because of their capacity and
devotion that the association has been supported
so generously through the years, and referred tt-

able to the association for the future. The principal

recreation services. (See page 356 for a condensed
presentation of Mr. Mullen’s address.)

On \Vednesday evening, the meeting was
chaired by Mr. Prendergast, and “Recreation
Needs in a Period of National Emergency” were
presented by a panel including Lieutenant Colonel
\Villiam A. Bishop, Chief, Special Services, Army
Recreation Service Branch; Commander E. A.
Waller, USN R, Head of Recreation Section, VVel—
fare Division, Bureau of Naval Personnel; Colonel
\Villiam Baily, Chief of Special Services, U. S. Air
Force; and Charles K. Brightbill, Executive Sec-
retary of the President’s Committee on Religion
and \Velfare in the Armed Forces.

The responsibility of recreation directors in tak-
ing the lead in providing off-post, community rec-
reation for servicemen and women at nearby
installations was stressed, and the possibility of
armed services personnel being used in program
in a volunteer capacity was brought out. It was
also stated that the skills of trained civilian special—
ists are urgently needed in setting up new on-post
recreation facilities. Recreation leaders were called
upon to offer their aid in coordinating existing
programs and in starting new ones. With the
experiences of the last war still fresh in our minds,
the job should be done before any soldier has to
come begging for a recreation center. The ad—

dresses of panel members were followed by ques-
tions from the floor.

The able chairman of Thursday evening’s meet-
ing, the Honorable Carl V. W eygandt, chief jus-
tice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, skillfully and
humorously led a panel of four college presidents
through one of the most stimulating discussions
of the Congress on “Recreation at the Midcentury.”
These college presidents included Dr. Paul Doug-
lass of the American University, Washington,
D. C.; Dr. David D. Henry of Wayne University,
Detroit, Michigan; Dr. Frederick L. Hovde of
Purdue, Lafayette, Indiana; and Dr. William E.
Stevenson of Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio. The
entire meeting was excellent, calling forth numer-
ous spontaneous questions from the Hoor, and pro-

viding a fitting climax to the series of general
sessions as a whole.

Discussion brought out the importance of pro-
viding recreation for the entire student body of
a college, with a director added to the faculty for
this purpose. One of the presidents suggested that
faculties be broken down for community use with-
in their respective areas, and warned against the
abuses and exploitation of pe0ple in recreation.
It was recognized that colleges should train pro-

352

fessional leadership for the recreation movement
and, although numerous good programs are under
way at the present time, more and better training
is needed. In fact, one member of the panel
pointed out that the colleges need guidance from
professional recreation workers in the development
of adequate and acceptable training programs.

Some thought that the core of the recreation.
curriculum should be the study of the man with
whom we are dealing, and more research done on
man himself. Learning takes place during all our
waking hours and is not confined to the classroom;
in fact, the most teachable moments occur when
individuals want action. The recreation situation,
of course, is fraught with such moments.

All felt strongly, too, that the doors to the crea—
tive approach to training should be thrown wide
open, and emphasized the desirability for flexibility
and the need for a variety of patterns in the '
training field. Leaders in recreation were advised
to get their message before the educators of the
country, and it was suggested that they be repre-
sented on the programs of the conventions of the
various collegiate organizations. So enthusiastic
were these college presidents that one volunteered
to write two articles to start the ball rolling toward
more effective relationships between the educators
and the recreation movement.

Congress at Work

 

The “new era” feeling—to which we have re-
ferred previously—seemed, if anything, to intensify
the seriousness of purpose and determination to
get done as- much as possible—which is traditional
at the Congress. Innocent bystanders were drawn
into the spirit of the thing and heard to remark
“These people certainly seem devoted to what they
are doing. What’s it all about anyway?”

The World Series notwithstanding, therefore,
daytime discussion meetings were well-attended,
with interesting things popping right and left, and
discussions spilling over into corridors, luncheon
and dinner parties and 'into the late evenings.
General consultants were available to delegates for
help on problems in specific areas of work, and
the consultants’ appointment book could be said to

RECREATION

be one of the most popular objects at the meeting.
Willard C. Sutherland, consultant on personnel
problems, was so much in demand that he almost
became one himself.

During the five days Of the Congress, several
special showings were held of “A Chance to Play,”
the new film produced by the March of Time for
the General Electric Company with the coopera-
tion Of the National Recreation Association. Don
Carter, Sales Manager, Lighting Division, General
Electric Company, Lynn River Works, was the
speaker on these occasions.

Recreation leadership training courses were
scheduled for three afternoons and were led by
the following NRA training specialists: Frank A.
Staples, arts and crafts; Grace Walker, dramatics;
Helen Dauncey, Anne Livingston and Mildred
Scanlon, social recreation. These courses were
received enthusiastically this year. Miss Walker’s
group participated in a final production as an out-
growth Of the work done in the dramatics class,
and it was suggested that, another year, her group
put on such a performance for the entire Congress
to illustrate what can be accomplished in a very
short time.

The series of thirty-four panel discussions
scheduled throughout each day, beginning at nine-
fifteen in the morning, dealt with such topics as:
What Are.County Recreation Agencies Doing to
Meet the Recreation Needs of Small TownSP;
Starting, Organizing and Conducting Playground
Activities; Guiding Principles for Recreation
Board Members; City-School Cooperation in the
Operation of Recreation Centers; Recreation on
College Campuses; Undergraduate Training for
Recreation Leadership; Graduate Training for
Recreation Leadership; What Can the Recreation
Leader Do to Promote Mental Health?; Creative
Program Planning for Older Age Groups; How
Does the Interpretation Of Recreation Help Build
Financial Support?; State Recreation Services to
Communities; How to Live with Television—
Friend or Foe?; How Can Recreation Agencies
Better Serve the Needs of Women and Girlsi’;
Cooperative Planning of Indoor and Outdoor Rec-
reation Facilities; and so on. (In order to obtain
a full account of these and all meetings, order your
CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS NOW.—Ed.)

Summaries of all meetings were presented every
morning at eleven to a “packed‘house’L—except on
Tuesday; when the time was given over to the
“mayors’ ” meeting. Here, again, the sesSion was
a lively one, as Harold Buttenheim, editor of the
American City, chaired a panel of six mayors in

DECEMBER 1950

a discussion Of “Why Recreation Is Important in
My City.”

The special conference on “Administrative Prob-
lems of Chief Executives of Local Recreation and
Park Agencies” was held on Monday morning this

year, again before the formal opening of the
National Recreation Congress.

Three other special recreation conferences also

opened on Monday morning and continued with a
series of meetings throughout the day and, in some
instances, on to the second day. These were the
hospital recreation meetings, jointly planned by
the American Recreation Society and the National
Recreation Association, and the rural recreation
and industrial recreation conferences.

The American Recreation Society held its annual
business meeting and luncheon as usual. (See the
November issue of RECREATION, page 305.)
Joseph Prendergast and Homer Wadsworth were
the guest speakers; and awards for “long and
outstanding service in the field of recreation” were
presented by the society to James S. Stevens, di-
rector Of the recreation board in Greenwich, Con-
necticut; to Mark A. McCloskey, director Of
community activities in New York City; and to
Grant Brandon, director of recreation in Lan-
caster, Pennsylvania.

Harry H. Stoops, assistant director of the
California State Recreation Commission, was elec-
ted new president Of the society.

Additional special meetings, arranged through-
out the week, included those on the \Vhite House
Conference, youth' hostels, music, tennis, junior
Olympics. surfacing. Practically every district 1'

state scheduled some kind of get-together. .At a
special luncheon, the story of Oglebay Park was
interestingly told. This year, too, army and air
force recreation directors had an opportunity to
meet for the first time to talk over their problems.
These two groups recruited professional recrea-
tion help throughout the Congress.

From Work to Play

The first planned social event on the busy
schedule occurred on Monday afternoon, when all
delegates were guests of the Board of Directors
of the National Recreation Association at tea, for
the purpose of personally meeting Joseph Prender—
gast and Mrs. Prendergast. Over four hundred
fifty people, appearing in best bib and tucker, lined
up to shake their hands in the spirit of gaiety and
fellowship that typifies the Congress.

Meetings made it necessary that most entertain-
ment be confined to evening activities. On Wed-
nesday, however, the entire afternoon was devoted
to a tour of Cleveland, loaded buses leaving the
Statler at two o’clock to swing through the inter-
esting lakeside city. Also, throughout the week,
delegates had a standing invitation to view the
Eighth Annual Arts and Crafts Exhibit of Cleve-
land—held in the rotunda of the City Hall—which
yearly demonstrates the work of groups of child-
ren and adults from public recreation centers,
settlements and Boystowns. This project is spon-
sored by the Joint Recreation Board of Cleveland.
(For further information about the board see
page 390-)

Entertainment and fun interspersed the more
serious matters at evening sessions. General sing-
ing, as always, was woven throughout these pro-
grams. In fact, there was so much demand for
music thataspecial meeting on the subject had to
be set up.

After the first session on Monday evening, a
play demonstration was given under the direction
of Anne Livingston, training specialist of the NRA,

354

with the assistance of Helen Dauncey, Mildred
Scanlon, Grace Walker—also training specialists
of the association—and Dr. Leonard Austin of
Cleveland. As an introduction, guests were enter—
tained by two sections of the recreation depart-
ment-sponsored One World Dance Group. The
Grupo Caroboa, a Negro group, interested in
studying their own native dances as well as those
of others from “south of the border,” gave a pres-
entation of Brazilian plantation dances to the ac-
companiment of a tom—tom; while the other group,
made up of folk dance enthusiasts, presented,
among others, German and Estonian dances. Both
groups wore colorful costumes, and all dances were
beautifully done and thoroughly enjoyed. After-
wards, those guests reluctant to disperse followed
up the entertainment with square dancing and
singing.

Tuesday evening was the oceasion of the Con-
gress banquet, which turned out to be very gala
indeed, with five hundred seventy guests attend-
ing. The speakers’ table was resplendent with
flowers, and gaiety was the keynote of the evening
from the time guests received their candy leis 0r
fiowers at the door until the end—when the last
tired dancer finally took himself upstairs. No time
was allowed for formality. Helen Dauncey almost
immediately took over the microphone and
launched a series of get-acquainted games. Winners
of the first were pronounced the hosts o'r hostesses
for their own particular tables, and the meal pro-
ceeded from there with great hilarity. Otto Mal-
lery, the toastmaster, fell into the spirit of the
occasion, and his opening remarks contributed

' much to the general fun.

After dining, guests were treated to music by a
harmonica band directed by William Dockens,
recreation director of Seville Homes in Cleve-
land, and to the excellent singing of a community
center choir directed by John Howard Tucker,
from the Cleveland Recreation Department, and
accompanied by the high school band. When the
speaker of the evening had finished, delegates—
led by Anne Livingston—swung into a spirited
rendition of their own state songs, after which the
Grand Ballroom was cleared for dancing.

Entertainment on Wednesday included a sing-
ing program, presented delightfully by the Cleve-
land Golden Age Chorus, ably led by Joseph Cisco
of the recreation department. The session was
followed by square dancing and group singing.

One of the main treats of the Congress was in

store' for delegates on Thursday evening when the
A Cappella Choir of Central High School—a

RECREATION

Negro choir of eighty singers—gave a too brief
concert under the leadership of Josephine Walker,
music director of the school. This is said to be the
finest choir in the Cleveland schools.

INDUSTRIAL
RECREATION

 

The special meetings on the problems en—
countered in industrial recreation or, preferably,
“employee recreation,” took place during Monday
and Tuesday of the conference.

The spirit of serious endeavor and of getting
work done in these meetings was in keeping with
that of the entire Congress. Presidents, vice-presi-
dents, directors of employee services, personnel
managers, industrial recreation directors and pub-
lic recreation executives participated in the seven
well-attended meetings. Ray Kooi, of the Ford
Motor Company, was the summarizer for these.

W. H. Edmund, of the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company, in speaking on “Evaluating the
Employee Recreation Program,” said that it is im-
possible to evaluate human emotion on any scien-
tific scale, but that a program could and should be
judged according to leadership, facilities, range of
activities offered, cooperation, encouragement to
all groups and interests.

Community industrial associations are on the
increase, and public recreation executives should
stand ready to help industries in organizing and
promoting games and sports of all kinds between
industries in any given community, according to
Joseph Schlupp, director of recreation in Denver,
where sixty-two plants have formed a large indus-
trial recreation association. J. A. Strobel, Recrea-
tion Director, AFL Labor Council, Milwaukee,
stated that the American Federation of Lab-or has
always stressed the importance of unions having an
immediate tie-up with the local public recreation
system.

“Enlightened management takes a personal in-
terest in the welfare of those whom it directs, and
that interest manifests itself in providing for the
recreation of the employee personnel,” said P.
Waldo Ross, Vice-President, Indianapolis Power
and Light Company, Indianapolis, Indiana. “Rec-
reation in all its forms . .
most effective and natural ways of personal con-
tact between management and men.” Courtney
Burton, Vice-President, Oglebay Norton Com-
pany, Cleveland, Ohio, spoke of the value that his
company has found in providing recreation activi-

. affords one of the'

ties for men on company ships, while at sea.

“The majority of women and girls do not like
competitive games, and where activities for women
and girls in industry have failed, it is largely be-
cause male industrial recreation directors do not
realize the importance of providing women leaders,
and because of their lack of understanding of the
fact that women prefer the social and cultural
activities,” reported Olga Madar, recreation di-
rector of 'the International UAVV-CIO.

G. M. Matlack, of Burlington Mills, North
Carolina, dealt with the broad field of industrial
relations with the local community. Said he:
“Industry must and should be the best citizen in
town. It should encourage employees to become
interested in community service . . . and the com-
munity as a whole should recognize what their
respective industries mean to them. . . Industry
and the community should share ‘give and take’ for
a community life that will make their town an
ideal place in which to work, worship, live and
play.”

S. J. Prezioso, of Scarsdale, New York, who
spoke on the same subject, pointed up why we,
in community recreation, are concerned with in-
dustrial recreation. “If we will but accept the
premise that the responsibility of the community
recreation director . . . is to provide more rec-
reation for all the pe0p1e, and is concerned with
the leisure-time program of the city’s various
recreation agencies—affecting as it does the lives
of people of all ages, types and interests—it is
inevitable that the recreation department be

- brought‘ into close relationship with many public

and private groups.”

Distinct trends in recent years, according to
surveys made on industrial recreation programs,
show the values of employee recreation. These, as
listed by management are: improvement in
morale; opportunity to become acquainted with
fellow workers; closer relation between employee
and management; better understanding and co-
operation, resulting in better teamwork; improve-
ment in health; reduction of fatigue and relief from
boredom for workers in a monotonous job.

Space does not permit describing the good talks
given by Oskar Frowein, Republic Aviation Cor-
poration, Farmingdale, Long Island, New York;
E. B. Smith, Monongahela Power Company, Fair-
mont, West Virginia; C. A. Emerich, Personnel
Manager, American LaFrance Company, Elmira,
New York; Carl Schreiber, Timken Roller Bear-
ing Company, Canton, Ohio; Dr. Vosburgh, Dow
Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan; and the
many others appearing on the program.

Suggesting a Way of Obtaining Financial Backing for Recreation

NOWING what recreation means to me, and
K what it has meant to my children, I know
how important the right kind of recreation is to the
people who work in my company and in others. I
have seen how much good recreation facilities and
guidance mean to a community.

Knowing those things, I can say to you, with
all the force and sincerity at my command, that
spending money on parks and playgrounds and on
recreation services for young people and older
people makes sense. It makes sense to me as a
citizen; it makes sense to me as a businessman.

I have been told that you
might like to hear the story
of our own plant activities
in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
which has a population of
about one hundred thou-
sand. W hat we did is an old
story to you people. We
built a playground. H 022!
we did it may give you some ideas which may help
you to build more and better playgrounds.

At one end of our plant property, across a nar-
row unpaved street from a row of small houses,
there were about two acres of unused land. Call
it a dump and you would not be far wrong. It
was full of rubble, unsightly, and of no immediate
benefit to anybody—company, employees or the
youngsters across the street.

Then about the middle of May of this year, a
thought suddenly came to me: “Let’s make a play-
ground out of that piece of property-hone that
everybody can enjoy.” Six weeks later, on July I,
a fine modern playground was dedicated in an ap-
propriate ceremony; thrownwopen to the public and
turned over to the city of Allentown.

The “park is neither large nor' pretentiohs, but
it is Well-equipped; and it fills a need becauSe it is
an oasis of recreation in ardesert of closely-packed
homes and ‘busy factories. 'At one end is a softball
diamond, now of the sandlot variety, but we hope
to have grass there soon. In the middle is a'clean,
well-bullt, well-fitted and well-kept rest house and
comfort station. Nearby, in' a section neatly paved
with black top, are the slides, junglegyms, swings,
teeters, basketball court and other devices which
boys and girls so dearly love. “Then beyond that
is a grassy park, beautifully planted with flowers,
shrubs and trees, with plenty of comfortable

356

 

benches upon which to sit and watch the young-
sters play or just plain relax. Now, how did it get
built P

The chief reason we were able to follow through
on the original idea so quickly and efficiently was
that my company, the Lehigh Structural Steel
Company, had established several years previously
What we call the Kift-Mullen Memorial Founda—
tion. This is a corporation in which are placed
five per cent of the annual profits of the company.
These funds, by provision of the foundation’s char-
ter, are disbursed for charitable, educational and

Untapped Pussihiliti’es...

scientific purposes. I will tell you more about the
Kift-Mullen Memorial Foundation later.

Because funds were available to underwrite the
basic costs of the park project, we were able to
move ahead quickly. We felt strongly, however,
that the community’s appreciation of the play-
ground would be in direct proportion to its own
contribution of effort in building it. If the company
did the Whole job, the community would have less
feeling of proprietorship and perhaps would take
less pride in it.

The company did the basic financing, provided
equipment and much of the material. A group of
our enthusiastic employees gave countless hours of
their own time after work, grading, building and
cleaning. Other industries in Allentown, about forty
in all, chipped in supplies and material—every-
thing from bricks for the comfort station to ice
creamcones for the youngsters on dedication day.

Even- the neighbors and the children helped.
They stored tools and equipment in. their homes,
and used their own trucks to carry away the debris
so that the land could be graded and sodded. Little
boys, who probably earlier this very day were
climbing around the junglegym or playing ball,
raked countless tons of rubbish into little piles for
easy loading on the trucks.

This was democracy in action. The playground
was built by local people with local funds. It was

accepted by the municipality and is being operated
by the recreation commission representing all the
people of the town. There is no town in America
too poor in money or spirit to go and do likewise.
You people, local leaders and leaders in the Na-
tional Recreation Association, should go out and
find those people, then spark them into action.

The National Recreation Association, your
great service organization, has long spearheaded
the recreation movement which means so much in
American life. The need exists for more money,
both to build new and better playgrounds through-
out the country, and also to extend the services of
your association—all in the interests of better
recreation facilities for a greater number of people.

As I have already stated, most of the money for
the Kift-Mullen Memorial Playground came out
of the foundation established by the Lehigh Struc-
tural Steel Company. I believe that a practical
solution to your problem will be found if each cor-
poration in America, large or small, would estab-
lish a foundation to which it would allocate the full
five per cent of its profits, before taxes, which the
Federal Government allows for contributions to
worthy causes. If this is done, numerous funds
would be available to provide a steady and gener-
ous income to support not only the recreation
agencies of the nation which are serving the public,
but also a wide variety of other charitable, educa-
tional and scientific enterprises.

If this plan is generally adopted, two benefits
~ would be realized. First, it would tend to increase
the funds available for deserving causes. Second,
it would reaffirm our belief in the traditional
American principle of doing things ourselves.

With these two objectives in mind, I am seeking
every opportunity to urge businessmen to establish
these foundations. I hope that you people will see
the significance and the potential in this idea as it
applies to your field so that you, too, will Spread
the word.

You will want to know something about the kind
of foundation which can be formed for such a pur—
pose. It is a nonprofit corporation in which five
per cent of net profits, before taxes, can be placed
by an industrial corporation, partnership or pri-
vately-owned business. All or part of these funds
can then be disbursed to selected educational,
scientific or charitable institutions. Part of the
foundation’s funds could be invested, with the

interest earned put to work for a good cause; or
else, contributions could be made direct from the
foundation’s funds.

Imagine what it could mean to such worthy
causes as recreation if every business firm in
America were to adopt such a plan. Not just the
big ones like Ford and General Motors, but little
business, too. My company is proud to have such
a foundation.

Naturally, a corporation’s stockholders should
be consulted before a foundation is established.
But support should be forthcoming when stock-
holders realize that the company is not giving
away all of its profits, but merely taking a very
small part of the earnings, before taxes, and invest-
ing it in the future of the community and the
nation.

In I949, the net income of all corporations, be-
fore taxes, was about twenty-eight billion dollars.
If five per cent of that sum had been given to
foundations to help colleges, universities, hospitals,
playgrounds and so on, they would have received
one billion four hundred million dollars. This is
equal to about one-third of the annual cost of
operating all of our public schools, and it is far
more than even a vote-hungry congressman would
dare ask.

Not only could such foundations provide funds
for colleges, but they would be a constant reservoir
for all local welfare agencies to draw upon—our
hospitals, homes for parentless children, parks,
playgrounds and other welfare institutions.

Some college presidents who are friends of
mine, and who have suggested this plan to indus-
trialists, have told me that the pe0ple they ap-
proached said that they would give to these colleges
without forming a foundation. This is true, and it
would probably be true so far as raising money
for recreation is concerned; but the facts are that
few, if any of us, give without solicitation.

The important feature of the plan is that there
is no bureaucratic cost involved. Such a foundation
would make its donations to the causes which
appeal to its oHicers. There is no need to dispense

357

Thomas R.
Mullen

 

all the funds received by the foundation in the year
that they are received from the parent company.
Rather, the funds can be dispensed when and how
the trustees see fit. It is, of course, necessary to
be careful that only organizations which the In-
ternal Revenue Department declares tax exempt
are the beneficiaries.

Foundations created by industries in a particular
city, for example, would, to a considerable extent,
make funds available for the benefit of local insti-
tutions. The same would be true in every other
community of the nation. Think what those
foundations could do for our local institutions
which require financial aid. Local people would be
spending their own money for the purpose that
they considered worthy.

Tom Rivers has told me what a difficult job it
is to raise the money for the National Recreation
Association. It would be much easier for this
great organization to keep up its many fine serv-
ices and to extend them—if two things were to
happen. First, if foundations were established by
many corporations throughout the country; sec-
ond, if you, yourselves, would help to interpret to
these local foundations the value of the work of
your national association. You can help in bring-
ing about both of those conditions. And, if you
succeed, your vital work will grow in importance.

In that connection, I should like to urge the
necessity of providing for good leadership in rec-
reation. I am sure that you recreation specialists
know its importance, but perhaps the businessmen
and civic officials concerned with recreation may
not be so aware of the need.

The best equipped playground in the world will
not of itself build character in the people who
use it, any more than the bricks or mortar in
college buildings can educate the students.

Equipment is important, but what counts far
more is people. A recreation budget that does not
provide for an adequate staff of recreation special-

ists is as inadequate for the job as a college budget
without provision for hiring a faculty.

If recreation is to grow in this country, as we
hope it will, more money will have to be spent for
it. But it also will be necessary for recreation to
provide, from its own ranks, an increasing number
of people with that instantly recognizable, but
quite indefinable, quality of leadership.

The man who emerges as a leader has more
than just an outstanding personality. More basic
than that, he will have a compelling desire to learn
about the job ahead even while he is doing the
job in hand.

Planned giving through business-financed foun-
dations provides a real opportunity to promote
many important works like yours. It is also an
opportunity to be grasped by the leaders in recre-
ation. If this opportunity is to be realized, how-
ever, it must be taken up and promoted vigor-
ously—not just by the business leaders who might
spearhead the foundations, but also by leaders in
education, recreation, welfare and other agencies
whose services and activities will be benefited.
That is where you can help.

If you know businessmen in your communities
who might be interested in establishing such
foundations, I will be glad to supply them with
c0pies of the charter of the Kift-Mullen Memorial
Foundation, or to answer their questions.

We cannot progress individually or as a nation
if we follow the old saying, “Let George do it.” ‘
Our country did not become great on’that basis,
and it will soon deteriorate unless we all knuckle
down and do for ourselves the jobs to be done.

This does not imply that taxpayers’ money
should not be used for recreation and similar pur—-
poses. Public financing is entirely proper under
many circumstances, but we should not turn to it
as the only source of funds for our welfare in-
stitutions.

In the public interest, we should work to im-
prove and extend our recreation facilities. Leader-
ship in that direction must come from within rec-
reation itself. You will not be demonstrating your
leadership to the full if your efforts are limited to
securing larger grants of public funds for the pur-
pose. Go beyond that limited horizon; explore
thoroughly the possibility of enlisting wider sup-
port from private sources. Show them how they
can help you; don’t just ask for money. Sell
recreation; don’t beg on its behalf. The story of
what recreation has done for America is a power-
ful one. The vision of what further can be done
with support is one that cries to be realized.

If you will lead, you will find many followers!

Village Drama in England Today

N a recent visit to England, I.was much
0 impressed with the way in which the small
villages and rural districts are developing their
own entertainment. Although most of the people
own radios, they do not listen to them quite so
assiduously as many Americans seem to do. Life is
harder and they are too busy with the essentials
of existence. When the cows are milked, the stock
fed and the last chores done, they may sit down
to listen to the news and perhaps a favorite pro-
gram; or, during the winter, they may attend a
social or a play put on by the local drama group.

Such groups are not new in England. They
were common in Shakespeare’s time, but there has
been a tremendous revival of interest in village
drama in the last forty years or so. To meet this
growth, the British Drama League was formed.
It acts in an advisory capacity, appointing tutors
to go to the villages to teach the art of drama to
any group interested, for a small fee. Each
group that wishes to join subscribes annually to
the league. So well is it supported that each
county now has its own staff of advisors and tutors,
all chosen by the league, who have to pass a
certain standard.

Each year, usually in the spring, a drama festival
is held at a focal point in the county. This may
last two or three days, during which the drama
groups from the villages for miles around compete.
They each send two representatives to arrange the
details of the rules and to choose an adjudicator
from among those approved by the British Drama
League. Short, one-act plays, or a single act of a
long play, are performed for the festival. Most of
the village will come to the session at which its
own team is performing to compare it with the
competitors. It is all very friendly and there are
not necessarily any awards presented or orders
of merit chosen. The chief function of the adjudi-

cator is to help each team to learn more of the
art of drama.

The little Devonshire village of Sampford
Spiney, where I was visiting, differs from the usual
picture of an English village in several respects.
It is not the closely-built group of picturesquely—
thatched cottages clustered near a few shops, the
inn and the church. In fact, there is not even a
post oflice, but only a bright red postbox in an
old granite wall running along the lane which
serves as “Main Street.” Just beyond is the lovely

 

Enthusiastic farm peOple turn to drama for recreation.

little thirteenth century church. There are no shops
and not even a “pub” where the villagers may
gather for an evening’s chat or game of darts.
The houses, all of granite, slate-roofed and
lichened, are widely scattered over the hilly
terrain.

Sampford is on the fringe of Dartmoor, made
famous in story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Gals-
worthy, Eden Phillpotts and others. The moor

35"

itself has retained its unconquered grandeur for
centuries. The hut circles and monoliths of Stone
Age man are clearly to be seen.

The present inhabitants of such little farming
communities skirting the moor—descendants of
the Britons driven to the west country by succes-
sive invasions—reflect their rugged character in
their own. There is a serenity about these people.
They are firmly conservative, unflinching, true,
solid, and as completely charming as their own
granite cottages, which have withstood so many
years of wild moorland weather. Yet they are not
lacking in a kindly sense of humor. Most are farm
folk in Sampford; a few work in the granite
quarries some distance away; and a few belong to
the so-called gentry.

The market town of Tavistock is four miles
away. For the most part, Sampford people have
to walk or bicycle. Not many have cars and, even
if they do, they are strictly rationed as to the
amount of “petrol” they may use. On Fridays,
market day, a bus comes to take them part of the
way into town. Many have to walk from one to
two or more miles to the starting point, and have
to carry their purchases home from that point in
the evening, since Sampford is so scattered.

It is no wonder then that the village drama
group has become so much a part of Sampford
life. There is a real need for the recreation it
affords participants and the audience. Perform-
ances are given in the little schoolroom next to the
church on a postage-stamp-sized stage. Only about
seventy persons can be seated at one time to view
the performance, and the stage can only be reached
from the back of the hall. The ingenious actors,
therefore, put up a curtain along one side the full
length of the hall to cover their entrances and exits.

Since the group is made up of farming people,
who are hard at work during the summer months,
they rehearse and put on their plays during the
long fall and winter evenings. Onelof the members
often writes one-act pieces for them in their own
Devon dialect. It is wonderful what they accom—
plish. They may have to come a couple of miles
on foot or bicycle to the schoolroom all during the
cold, wet nights of the winter to do it, but they
certainly have fun over it. ’

One recent incident is typical. One member of
the cast, A, was to shoot B, who, in the script,
says: “Oh, my God, he’s shot me!” This so
shocked the members, and especially B, that they
substituted “Oh, my goodness, he’s shot me!” On
the night of the performance A, to make matters
realistic, fill’ed*his water pistol with red ink. He
duly shot B, who cried: “Oh my goodness, he’s

360

shot me!” Then, suddenly seeing the red ink,
“My God, he has l”

Such drama groups usually begin with one or
two enthusiasts who sound out a few friends.
They may call an informal meeting of all inter-
ested persons and, after discussion of the pros and
cons, appoint a committee and elect a producer,
a secretary and a treasurer. In Sampford, they
found it best to make as few rules as possible,
since the reason for forming a village group is to
give pleasure to the actors and to the audience, and
to be a medium of expression for those whose life
is otherwise rather colorless. They do insist that
the group, be open to all who wish to join, and
that the group should not think of any person as
being a “star.” Each is a member of a team and,
as such, the stronger help the weaker members.
They try to consider the educational value in their
choice of play, and refuse to do any which depict
domestic unhappiness or drunkenness. Since they
feel that no person, however poor, should be out
of pocket by joining, the Sampford Spiney group
sponsors socials, concerts, card parties and so
forth, charging admittance to pay expenses. They
fix their own lighting, scenery and props because,
even if imperfect, they find it more interesting to
do the work themselves.

The plays may receive quite a wide showing, as
they are not dependent entirely upon the home
village for an audience. The drama group is often
invited to give its play in any of the neighboring
villages which may or may not have groups of
their own. Since most of the plays given consist
of one short act, the drama groups frequently
invite other groups to help them make up a full
program. Such programs are usually for some
cause or other, and visiting groups receive their
transportation. There is always a get—together
over sandwiches and tea provided by the hosts
after the show, and the tired, but happy, players
ride home with lots of singing. None of the actors
at any time receives any remuneration; but all give
and receive something that can’t be measured.

Thus, throughout England, many small and iso-
lated communities—mwhose members are unable to,
and not in the habit of motoring for miles to at—
tend a movie—are solving entertainment problems
in their own way, and having a great deal more
fun out of it, too.

"Drama opens the doors to adventure; it releases the
spirit. Here one may run the round of . pleasure and
pain vicariously; rise to the heights of accomplish-

ment or explore the haunts of misery. . . .”

A SERVICMMEN’S

HE popular beach resort town of Oceanside,

California, is one of the few communities in
the country which was not caught with its service-
men’s recreational facilities down when the various
military services began enlarging their training
bases as a result of the Korean situation.

To the contrary, Oceanside, located half-way
between Long Beach and San Diego on the Pacific
Coast, had one of the three municipally-supported
service clubs in operation before the war, and was
well-prepared to handle most of the recreational
needs of leathernecks stationed nearby at Camp
Joseph H. Pendleton, the largest marine training
base in the West.

Since March of this year, the city has operated
a servicemen’s recreation center in its downtown
community center building for the men at Pendle-
ton and the Santa Marguerita Naval Hospital.
When lack of funds forced the YMCA-USO pro-
gram to be discontinued last January, the city
council of Oceanside voted unanimously to keep
the center open for military personnel in the area,
and has actively supported all of the club’s many
functions, which are handled by the recreation de-
partment.

The club room has proved immensely popular as
indicated by the attendance of some 40,579 men
since the city took over. Facilities include pool and
ping-pong tables, television and radio-phonograph
sets, a free checking service, writing rooms and
stationery, a shower room and a limited library.
Plans are under way to expand the facilities in
order to cope with the huge influx of men at
Camp Pendleton.

Dances are held every Friday night in the
auditorium under the cosponsorship of the recrea-
tion department and the Community Chest. A
hostess club has been formed of some twenty girls
who plan the dances, decorate the hall and help
serve refreshments. Various local women’s serv-
ice clubs and sororities provide chaperones and re-
freshments. Since the emergency, an increasingly
large number of volunteers have given their time
and energy to the programs.

Supervisor of the center is Mrs. Pearl Crutcher,
a friendly matron who never ceases striving to
make a home away from home for “her boys.”
Mrs. Crutcher has had three sons in the service
and is well-prepared to meet most of the emergen-
cies which arise nightly at the center. One of her
biggest headaches is finding housing facilities in
town for the wives and children of servicemen who
are flocking to Oceanside in order to keep the
family together as long as possible. The Travelers
Aid, the Chamber of Commerce and the Red Cross
have been swamped with requests for rooms, and
the townsfolk are responding wholeheartedly.

Working with the recreation department in help-
ing to organize the center’s programs is the Serv-
icemen’s Advisory Recreation Committee, appoint-
ed by Mayor Joseph MacDonald and composed of
townsfolk who were active in service work during
World War II. Chairman Harold Beck, pub-
lisher of the Oceanside Blade-Tribune, heads the
committee and acts as public relations liaison be-
tween the city and Pendleton. Other members in-
clude the chairman of the Community Chest, a
chest board member, Oceanside’s recreation direc-
tor, the special services oflicer of the camp and

also. The recreation director then plays a portable
organ, and all join in, singing the familiar carols.
Patients reminisce and suggest old and favorite
tunes. A Christmas quiz is climaxed by the serv-
ing of hot chocolate and Christmas cookies.

On the next afternoon, the victrola and organ
are taken to a men’s closed ward for a similar
party. This is attended by all patients from other
wards in this building who are not able to attend

FOR WEEKS during the Christmas season, our
closely-knit little community of seven hundred
fifty patients resounds with holiday laughter and
song. Old familiar Christmas carols are heard as
soon as December first arrives. Occupational
therapy classes are busy making wreaths and out-
side decorations for all the buildings and lawns.
There is much talk as to which building will be
the gayest, both inside and out, with its bright-
colored and original decorations. Recreation
classes are busy planning decorations for the gym-
nasium where many parties will be held. Closed
ward patients are cutting out a multitude of stars,
all sizes, which will be shellacked, sprinkled with
artificial snow and hung from bright-colored
streamers. All patients are urged to take part in
the preparation, as some task, no matter how
simple, makes one a part of the group working
together toward one goal. In the recreation build-
ing, Protestant and Catholic choirs, enlarged by
an added group of volunteer singers, rehearse for
the evening Christmas program.

Christmas week opens with a party in the in—
hrmary for those elderly people who are unable to
leave the building or to get around easily. They
gather in the solarium, around the Christmas tree,
to hear carols played on the victrola. A short chat
with bed patients in nearby rooms, while this is
going on, draws such patients into the festivities

any outside activities. Patients guess titles of
Christmas carol records, and again forget their
troubles in the joy of singing. Individual talents
often are discovered as someone offers a new song
or poem, remembered perhaps from some past
community or family activity. Refreshments, of
course, again climax the fun.

The program the next day is held in the closed
wards of the women’s building, where dancing to
waltz and polka music adds to the gaiety. A
word of cheer to those not able to take an active
part, a compliment and thanks to those who helped
make decorations, give each a feeling of belonging
to the group. n

In-between these ward activities, the recreation
director, with the help of patients, assistants and
occupational therapists, is turning the gymnasium
into a winter wonderland in preparation for the
night concert and parties to come. One patient
has done two water-color panels of angels, six
feet high, with a musical theme below. These are
placed in wall sections on each side of the stage.
Circular stained glass windows are placed in
niches in the stone on each side of the huge fire-
places at each end of the room. Basketball baskets
are turned into old English lanterns with amber
lights, the wrought iron crane effect carrying the
theme up to the balcony immediately above the
backstops. The door of the balcony has been
covered with a lighted window scene, and the
balcony railing is covered with boughs of greens
accented with snow. The other sides of the bal-
cony are covered with green boughs, with a large
red bow in the center, and the twelve windows
around the hall are similarly decorated.

The center of the two-story hall is highlighted
by a cluster of old-fashioned red and white paper

RECREATION

bells of varying sizes, with green boughs. Radi-
ating in all directions from this to many points of
the balcony are red, green and white crepe paper
streamers from which hang hundreds of sparkling
stars on different lengths of black thread. The
effect is startling, as the stars appear to be sus-
pended in mid-air. Four fioodlights of red and
green, shining from the ceiling from both sides of
the room, give a soft glow to the scene. The stage

fHospital '

backdrop is a soft blue, with a few stars suspended
and, in the center, stands a green tree with only
silver icicles decorating its boughs. On each
side of the front of the stage is a ten-foot tree,
decorated with bright-colored lights and trimmings.
A Christmas tree with all home-made decorations
shines from beside the fireplace in the recreation
and game room.

On the mantel stands a large red candle made
of construction paper. From the yellow cellophane
flame the smoke spells “Merry Christmas” across
the large mirror above the fireplace. The smoke
is covered with shellac and sprinkled with artificial
snow. Many green boughs are scattered about the
room with bright-shining stars of red and green
above them on the wall.

Wednesday, at seven p.m., the hall is filled with
all patients who are able to leave their separate
buildings alone or with attendants. Song sheets
are given to them as they enter, and they are made
to feel that they are part of the program through-
out the evening. The processional, “O, Come All
Ye Faithful,” sung by the audience, ushers the
large choir onto the stage. Four men from a nearby
community, known as “Balladiers,” entertain with
two. groups of songs, and assist the choir in the
remainder of the program. A narrator introduces
each group by a bit of scripture-telling of the
Christmas story. Songs about the shepherds,
angels. Star in the East, wise men and manger
scene are sung by choir, patient-soloists and au-
dience. The recessional, “Joy to the World,” sung
by all, concludes the evening program.

On Thursday afternoon, a group of over one
hundred working patients arrives for a gala party.
They come from the kitchen, laundry, living room,
farm, lawn groups, engineering division and many

DECEMBER 1950

other places. It is a pleasure to entertain them
for they are appreciative and ready to take part
in every activity. A carol sing, interspersed with
action songs, gets them into the mood for fun.
Chairs are pushed back and contestants line up to
see who, when blindfolded, can pin various parts
of Santa and his attire on a huge, six-foot crayon
drawing on the wall. A Christmas package relay
is hilarious. Those not taking part are lined up
on the sides, cheering. After other races, all join
in for their favorite game, musical chairs, played
to lively Christmas melodies. A grand march pre-
cedes refreshments, interesting figures ending in
a large circle mixer to the tune of “Jingle Bells.”
While this is going on, the passive participants are
served orange ice, ginger-ale punch and cakes.
The active group files to the colorful refreshment
table to the tune of Christmas records.

Friday climaxes the week of parties, when all
the active occupational and recreational therapy
and parole patients arrive for a rollicking after-
noon. They, too, start with a song and are enter-
tained by a fine soloist who is a patient. The game
of “categories” follows. A letter is shown by the
leader as he calls a category and, amid much excite-
ment, each side tries to be the first to name a
word. Chairs are then quickly moved back and a
circle formed for the “Merry Christmas Shaker
Mixer,” during which everyone offers a Merry
Christmas and a handshake to anyone he meets.
Next, two teams are chosen—twenty-one on a
side—and each contestant given a cardboard letter.
As the director calls a word pertaining to Christ-
mas, each player holding a letter of that word
rushes to a designated point and joins his co-
partners in trying to form the word more quickly
than the opposing team. Passive participants are
as excited as the active group. And how important
it is that all patients be included in activity in some
way! Becoming a part of a group is so important
in the recovery from a mental illness. Again, a
grand march and mixers lead to refreshments.

Every evening of the holiday week, town carol-
lers can be heard singing outside the buildings;
but, on Friday evening, the hospital choirs combine
to tour the hospital wards. Taking song sheets
with them, they urge patients to join in the sing-
ing. A young patient who has just come out of a
long coma hears the voices from her room farther
down the hall and bursts into song, remembering
every word; no need for a song sheet. She can
be heard singing long after the group has left the
hall. So through the evening this small com-
munity feels a bond of brotherhood and the spirit
of Christmas.

An idea for community centers

DEDICATION OF A CHRISTN‘

lene, Texas, was presented with a fifteen—

foot tall living juniper tree. This was brought
in by our park board planters and carefully planted
on our front lawn; lights and a top star were
added by other community folk. We decided there—
upon to have a ceremony dedicating this tree to
the community and to its youth.

ELAST YEAR, our community YMCA in Abi-

The following are excerpts from what proved to
be a successful and moving service:

SPOKESMAN: The story is told that, centuries
ago, Martin Luther was tramping through the
woods of Germany in the twilight of a winter eve-
ning. It was nearing Christmas time, and he was
wondering how to bring God’s goodness and the
challenge of the Savior’s life to the common people
who lived near him.

Suddenly he saw an evening star twinkle in the
gathering dusk directly above the crest of an ever-
green tree just ahead of him. The beauty of the
star-tipped tree stopped Martin Luther in his
tracks. The snow—ladened branches dipped their
boughs as though at prayer. The tree seemed to
lift its head to its Maker above, proud of its star-
tipped crown. In the hush of the evening, Luther,
now known as the founder of our Protestant
Church, saw in this tree the symbol of life dedi-
cated to the glory of God; a living testimony to
the everlasting spirit of life and God’s care for
Man found in the birth of the Christ Child.

He not only was captured by the beauty of the
scene, but also by the simplicity of the message of

 

Mr. C. M. Angel i: at present execntive secretary

the glorified tree. That Christmas season, the first
tree was dedicated in his little church as an annual
symbol of the dedication of Man’s everyday ex-
perience to the cause of life abundant, expressed
by the rebirth each year of the spirit of the Christ
Child in the hearts of youth; yea, of all Mankind.

SONG: “I Think that I Shall Never See, a Poem
Lovely as a Tree.”

THE TREE SPEAKS: Only a short time ago, I
stood with other trees growing peacefully around
me. . . Now I have been chosen to stand alone;
each year to lift my branches to the open sky; each
night thanking God that my life shall be dedicated
in this spot to the cause of youth. . .

You who enter these portals shall pass me each
day, each night as you come here to play, to meet
your friends, to learn of life and how to live it
well. I shall dip my boughs in greeting to you.
I shall softly murmur in the breezes that you may
remember this occasion. . .

Do not think me puny or insignificant because
I am small. Remember, I, too, am young like you.
I shall grow straight and tall and sturdy for years
to come. So must you. That is my challenge to
you. That was the challenge—and is today—the
appeal of the Master’s life—to grow in stature,
in wisdom and in favor with God and Man.

Together we shall glorify His name by what we
do in our daily lives in this place, the center of the
life of youth in our community. Let no one despise
us because we are youths. We must set . . . an
example of faith, of love, of behavior in our daily
conduct. . .

Following this outdoor program, our lobby was
thrown open. Around the open fireplace games
and music furnished further holiday activities for

both young pe0ple and their parents. Christmas
movies were shown, including winter sports, holi-
day cartoons and singing groups. This event took
place on the night of December fifteenth, and each
night, until Christmas, club groups sang around
the tree, and various holiday parties were held by
different youth groups in our building.

Adapting Familiar Games for Christmas

The following games, played at Christmas
parties in Frankfort, Kentucky, last year, illus—
trate how the old stand-bys can be streamlined
to fit the seasonal theme.

Down the Chimney
(Boys and girls, ten years of age and up)

Materials: Tall cardboard box wrapped with
brick-designed crepe paper. Three tennis balls
or cotton wrapped with string to represent snow—
balls.

How to Play: The group is divided into teams.
Each team takes its turn pitching the balls into
the chimney. (Each member pitches three balls
from a distance of six to twelve feet, depending
upon the age of the group.) One point is given
for each successful throw. The team making the
most points wins the game.

Alphabet Spelling
(Boys and girls, ten and up—adults)
Materials: Package of alphabet macaroni.

DECEMBER 1950

How to Play: The group is divided into teams
and each team is given a handful of alphabet
macaroni. The leader then tells the teams to
spell out some Christmas phrase—such as “Merry
Christmas,” “Happy New Year.” The first team
to complete the phrase wins.

Note: This game may be played at any season or

'during any type of party, adapting the phrases

to the occasion.

Steal the Cane
(Boys and girls, ten and up)

Materials: Candy canes.

How to Play: This is played just like “Steal the
Bacon,” but instead of using an Indian club, a
stick of candy is placed midway between the two
teams. The one who gets away with the “bacon”
gets to keep it. However, if he is tagged, he must
forfeit the candy to his opponent.

This material was submitted by Alfred Elliott, who
is director of recreation for Frankfort, Kentarh.

Recreation and Parks

W alter Roy, New Institute President

Walter Roy, able
recreation director of
the Chicago Park Dis—
trict, whose election
as new president of
the American Institute
of Park Executives
met with a great ova—
tion in September, al-
ready is demonstrat-
ing his determination
to promote the inter-
ests Of the institute. Among other things, he is
backing the institute with his cooperation and
approval for the inclusion of park data in the
1951 edition of the RECREATION Year Book, pub-
lished by the National Recreation Association.

Mr. Roy has had extensive experience in park
and recreation work, having started in South
Parks many years ago, serving in turn as physical
instructor, park supervisor, director of athletics
and assistant director of recreation. In 1934,
twenty—two park districts in the city of Chicago,
including South Park, consolidated to form the
Chicago Park District, and Mr. Roy functioned
as assistant director of recreation until the retire-
ment in 1948 of V. K. Brown, at which time he
became director.

During the days of W PA, he was loaned to the
state of Illinois to set up state-wide professional
projects; while today he has been loaned to the
city of Chicago to organize the metropolitan Office
of Civilian Defense.

He is currently a member Of the Advisory Com-
mittee of the Athletic Institute and of the Ad-
visory Council of the American Recreation Society.

 

 

1951 RECREATION Year Book to
Contain Park Data

The 1951 edition of the RECREATION Year Book
will, for the first time, contain data on municipal
and county park areas and total expenditures of
park departments. Heretofore, the Year Book,
which has been issued annually or biennially by
the National Recreation Association since 1907,
has included only reports of recreation programs

366

under leadership or of major facilities operated
under supervision. Many park departments have

.regularly submitted reports for use in the Year

Book, but these have covered only the parts of
their total service which related to organized
recreation programs and facilities, such as swim-
ming pools, golf courses and athletic areas.

The RECREATION Year Book for 1951 will carry
two additional types of information: (I) the
number and acreage Of municipal and county
parks; (2) the total 1950 expenditures of park
authorities. The decision to expand the scope of
the current issue was reached after consultation
with the American Institute of Park Executives,
which approved the proposed changes.

The latest available figures on municipal and
count?! park acreage in the United States are for
the year .1940. They were published by the asso-
ciation after a study conducted in cOOperation
with the National Park Service. In order to pro—
vide information on the present status of muni-
cipal and county parks and the gains which have
been made in land acquisition during the past
decade, the association is asking local park and
recreation authorities to submit data on their
properties.

The National Recreation Association has long
recognized the fact that the many services
rendered by park departments are essentially
recreation services. The expenditures data pub-
lished in the Year Book, however, have been re-
stricted to the amounts spent for organized rec—
reation programs and services and for develop-
ing, operating and maintaining areas and facilities
designed for active recreation use. But this year,
park departments are asked to report their capital
and current expenditures of all types. They will
find it much easier to fill out the Year Book
blank than when it was necessary to estimate the
amounts spent for organized recreation service.
In most respects, the information requested on
the Year B 0012 blank is identical with that gathered
in previous years, and most departments and
organizations providing community recreation will
furnish the same type of data as before.

Questionnaires will be mailed about January
first. Cooperation by local and county park and
recreation authorities in filling out and returning
them promptly will assure a comprehensive and
useful Year Book.

ACH SUMMER thousands of young Americans travel
through the out-of-doors in American and other
lands at an average living cost of $1.25 a day, ex-
cluding initial transportation costs, to distant places.
Hiking or pedaling, by canoe or on horseback, they make per—
sonal use of one of the most rewarding and least expensive
forms of recreation.
Through American Youth Hostels, they are able to enjoy
. low-cost travel, iinding health in vigorous, outdoor living, and
Hon 8 happiness in the adventure of makmg new friends and ex-
ploring far horizons. The stored value of thelr experlence,
that will serve them in their future work and everyday rela-
tionships, is immeasurable.

Last year, a total of thirty thousand “overnights” were
chalked up by young American travelers at some 160 hostels
provided for them by American Youth Hostels along the trails

Arnold Caplan and highways of such scenic and recreational areas as the New
England Coast, the White and Green Mountains, the Berk-
shires and the Alleghenies, the Rockies and the Great Lakes
region. Others used scores of similar hostels abroad.

American hostels are situated in twenty-nine states. Made
possible by the neighborly interest and hospitality of local cit-
izens, supported by the cooperative help of the young hostelers
themselves, these hostel accommodations are located in barns
and farm buildings, in cabins and private homes, in churches

med through the comes, of pm, magazine_ and schools, and even in former military lodgings.

All hostelers subscribe to the universally-accept-
ed hosteling code for simple living. They agree to
travel by their own effort, to provide and prepare
their own meals, to do their share of “clean-up”
before they leave, to refrain from drinking or
smoking on the premises. Observance of these
simple rules is required of all members to main-
tain youth hostel privileges.

Each hostel provides separate sleeping quarters
and washrooms for young men and young women,
a common kitchen where hostelers may cook their
meals and, in most cases, recreation facilities.
Hostelers travel light, knowing that they will find
clean beds, blankets and cooking utensils at each
overnight stop.

There are no age limits nor special requirements
to be a hosteler. Facilities are available to anyone
who holds a membership pass, issued at low cost
to individuals or groups.

In 1910, Richard Schirrman, a young German
teacher, conceived the idea of making the country-
side accessible to the school children of the great
industrial centers. When appointed administrator
of a museum housed in a twelfth century castle,
he obtained permission to open some of its unoc-
cupied rooms to school children exploring the
country.

Travelers from other lands were initiated into
the simple carefree life of the youth hosteler and

were eager to transplant its benefits to their own

countries.

In 1932, several hosteling associations met in
Amsterdam to form the International Youth Hos—
tel Association, now called International Youth
Hostel Federation. Represented in this group are
twenty countries, and through the federation, as-
sociations have agreed to recognize members from
all other associations for use of their facilities.
They have also agreed upon a number of customs
in common, including that which makes hostels
available only to those who travel under their own
power.

In 1932, Isabel and Monroe Smith, two Ameri-
can teachers and youth workers, went to Europe
to make a survey of youth movements there. The
hostel movement attracted them more and more,
and they returned to the United States determined
to introduce it to Americans.

They received permission from IYHF in 1934
to establish an American youth hosteling organiza-
tion. AYH was incorporated in Massachusetts in
1934. The first hostel in the United States opened
that same year in Northfleld, Massachusetts, as
did AYH headquarters.

During the next few years, hostels opened

368

throughout New England, and the idea gradually
spread south and west. In the summer of 1949,
there were I I3 hostels located chiefly in New Eng-
land, the Middle Atlantic states, around Washing-
ton, D. C., in the Middle West and on the Pacific
Coast.

In the late 1930’s, AYH established its first
Local Council. The councils have since become
the basic unit of organized hosteling in the United
States. They carry on a program of trips and set
up hostels in and around their own communities.
There are now thirty-five AYH councils in the
United States. -

One of the council’s most important duties is
to select from among responsible townspeople the
resident “house parents” for each hostel in the
region it serves. Hostels are regularly inspected
to assure the maintenance of high standards and
are chartered annually by AYH national head-
quarters.

Most people are interested in hosteling. They
feel it offers something new and different. Natu—
rally, they want to know what it’s like.

your own age at noon on a summer’s day. Maybe

you’ve been on your trip you have been alternately
somewhat embarrassed and very much amused by
how much you can eat. Anything, you have found,
tastes delicious to hostelers, so long as there’s
plenty. Ever since your trip began, the days have
been filled with new people and places. This morn-

RECREATION

ing, for instance, you may have found that French
Chateaux actually look like their pictures; or that
Hawaii, as well as Greece, has a Mount Olympus.

After lunch you’ll be heading for tonight’s hos-
tel—perhaps a farmhouse in New England or a
houseboat in Sweden. Or maybe you’ll be pit'ch-
ing your sleeping bag in a field or on a cliff by the
sea. You look around at the others in your group,
and at your leader. When you started, you knew
only your friend from school. By now you all
know each other well. It’s hard to say why this
group seems special, but it does, and you’re very
glad you’re part of it.

So there you are, as you can picture it. And,
of course, it needn’t stop with your imagination.

Here’s what some veteran hostelers have to
say about their experiences:

Mary Cannon, a member of a southwest Euro-
pean trip of 1949, says: “Hosteling isn’t the easiest
way to travel, but it definitely has its advantages.
We were always running into fellow countrymen
who discussed their European travels with a fury
bordering on apoplexy. Everywhere they went
they were ‘robbed’ because they were ‘rich Amer-
icans.’

“I would be willing to bet that no one will con-
fuse your hostel group with the ‘rich Americans.’
Customs officials won’t bother you, either. What
self-respecting customs officials would be caught
shuffling through nine dusty saddlebags?

“All in all, I think you’ll find it rather pleasant
being a peasant. You’ll never have to worry about
what to wear or how much to tip the redcap. In
the resort hotels, Americans meet other Americans.
In every hostel you’ll meet a miniature United
Nations. Your high school French will blossom
like a flower in the spring time, and you’ll prob-
ably start considering a diplomatic career.”
Barrie Tait, of a British Isles trip, observes:

. safely protected by a big poncho or rain-
coat, with blue jeans rolled up, wearing sneakers,
the cyclist is in the enviable position of actually
enjoying the rain. Who else can say that? Fur—
thermore, riding with the rain in your face is far
more pleasant than many imagine. Try it and see.
If it is pouring ‘cats and dogs,’ of course, any smart
cyclist will seek the protective branch of a tree
until the deluge subsides somewhat. In any case,
rain seldom need interfere with hostel fun.”

What equipment will you need?

In addition to your personal effects, you are re-
quired to have a youth hostel pass. An AYH
pass is a membership card entitling you to use
hostels and committing you to follow youth hostel
customs when you travel as a passholder. There

H

are five kinds: Youth I’ass, two dollars for those
under twenty-one; Adult Pass, three dollars for
those twenty-one or over; Youth Organization
Pass, five dollars for a group of ten, including one
or two adult leaders, from a bona firle youth agency
or organization; Adult Organization Pass, ten
dollars for a group of ten members of a bona tide
adult agency or organization; Family Pass, five
dollars for parents and any number of their chil-
dren under twenty-one.

other hostel associations belonging to the Inter-
national Youth Hostel Federation. Organization
and family passes are not valid outside the United
States. All passholders receive the quarterly AYH
Knapsac/c and the annual AYH Handbook.

Bicycle or your feet—depending upon the trip—
will be your chief mode of getting around. When
necessary, groups use trains (coach and third
class) or buses to supplement long trips. AYH
headquarters makes major transportation arrange-
ments, such as ocean crossings, prior to the trips.

On the road, groups usually stay together, par-
ticularly at first. As time goes on, members may
separate in the morning and afternoon, meeting
for lunch and at the final destination.

Hostels may vary from the simplest kind of
structure, with hay under your sleeping bag, to
a beautiful building especially designed for your
needs. All hostels are supervised by resident house

369

parents. Early to bed and early to rise are hostel
customs, and each person does a share of kitchen
or other work.

You and your group will buy and cook most of
your own food. Your diet may be sumptuous on
occasion; more often it will be simple, and will de-
pend upon the area of your trip. But it will always
be. adequate.

You carry all your equipment upon your bicycle
or upon your back, and are expected to have room
for some group equipment, such as food.

Each hosteler needs a sheet sleeping sack and
his own eating utensils. All trips, except for a
designated few, call for camping out. For this,
hostelers need a nylon poncho and a lightweight
(six to seven pounds) sleeping bag with a water—
repellent cover. Bulletins contain specific require—
ments for each trip. Hikers also need knapsaéks to
carry all their equipment and boots which will
stand up under hard wear and be comfortable.

Cyclists pack equipment in bicycle saddlebags
and in a handlebar bag (AYH wander bag). Bi-
cycles must be lightweight touring models with at
least one hand brake and, preferably, with gears.
Luggage carriers must be steel, with tubular side
supports, preferably with a rat-trap spring.

Clothing requirements vary according to trips
and individual preference. All materials must be
easily washable, lightweight and durable. For
lightweight clothing, nylon is best; seersucker 0r
rayon jersey is second choice. For warm cloth-
ing, choose corduroy, lightweight wool gabardine
or cotton flannel. (Required and other equipment
is available from some AYH Local Councils and
from the AYH Supply Service, 360 Glenwood
Avenue, East Orange, New Jersey.)

Each group member receives a day-by-day itin-
erary before starting. All groups are eXpected to
keep advance reservations at hostels and mail
stops. In areas where there are no hostels, leaders
make other arrangements or groups camp out, de-
pending upon the locality. In these areas, devia-
tions from the planned itinerary are subject to
group decision.

Average groups include eight members with a
leader. Groups usually include both young men
and young women, and the leader may be either.
If you want to join a group with a friend, AYH
will try to arrange for this. However, no more
than two people who know each other before the
trio may join any group.

Leaders are experienced hostelers, at least
twenty-one years of age, who have taken the AYH
Leadership Training Course. In a group, the lead-
er does not act as director, but rather as “senior

370

partner” in a democratic and cooperative venture.

If you are to be a member of an AYH head-
quarters-sponsored trip, you must join the group
at its starting point and stay with it throughout
the trip, except in cases of emergency. You may
not ‘join a group after it has begun a trip.

Leaders will grant reasonable requests for side
trips at their discretion. Hostelers under twenty-
one must, however, have written permission for
such trips from parents or guardian. Expenses of
side trips are the individual’s concern and should
not be for more than three or four days.

Locally, hostelers can spend as little as $1.00
to $1.50 per day. Those traveling alone may spend
more than those eating in groups. Hostel rates are
forty cents per night for youths, lifty cents for
adults, with a daytime charge of twenty-five cents
for use between nine am. and live pm.

Most hostelers hike ten to lifteen or bike twenty
to forty miles per day. They attempt distances
short enough to allow for side trips, sightseeing
and meeting pe0ple on the way.

To qualify for a headquarters-sponsored trip you
must be ready to Spend your summer traveling
simply and to take your part in a close—knit group.
For trips in the United States and Canada, you
must have been at least lifteen on June I, 1950.
For all other trips, you must have been at least
seventeen on that date. You must be physically
able—as testilied by your doctor—to bicycle forty
miles a day with a thirty-pound pack upon your bi-
cycle or hike twenty miles with a twenty-live pound
pack.

To apply for a trip, you must hold a current
AYH pass. If you do not hold one, you may ob-
tain it through the AYH Local Council nearest
you or direct from national headquarters in North—
lield, Massachusetts.

When you have completed your application, you
send it to headquarters through your council. With
it you send two photographs and a fifteen-dollar
registration fee. As soon as your application is re-
viewed, you will receive word. Review and col-
lecting of reference letters usually take about three
weeks.

To be ready for a trip, you will need to begin
preparation as soon as you are accepted. Your
main concerns will be to assemble complete equip-
ment, put yourself in condition for bicycling or
hiking, and learn as much as you can about the
places you will visit. To help you do this, na—
tional headquarters will send you bulletins on all
these subjects. Bulletins will also keep you in—

formed on your trip schedule, group members,
passport and visa regulations.

RECREATION

 

Just before “lights out,” youngsters swap adventures
of the day and speculate on happenings of the morrow.

To qualified individuals of twenty-one years or
over, AYH headquarters offers each year the chance
to lead its summer-sponsored trips. Leaders’ trip
expenses are covered, plus a small bonus. You may,
however, be one of the many hostelers who plans
to travel next summer on your own or with friends.
AYH can also help you.

For a general picture of international hosteling,
AYH can supply you with the International H and-
book, which covers each of the twenty-four IYHF
association countries. (Each handbook, fifty cents.)

For information about mapping your trip, pre—
paring for it, equipment, reading list for areas you
may visit, send to the AYH headquarters for its
series of bulletins on international hosteling.

For hosteling in the United States, consult your
nearest local council.

Youth hostelers form a world—wide fellowship.

Membership in any national youth hostel organ-.

ization is honored by all other international fed-
eration associations. The youth hostel pass is a
passport to hostel facilities in other member coun-
tries, assuring a warm welcome to hostelers.
Member countries of the International Youth
Hostel Federation today include Algeria, Australia,
Austria, Flanders, Belgium; Walloon, Belgium;
Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Eire, Finland,
France, England and Wales, Northern Ireland,
Scotland, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, Morocco,
New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,
Tunisia and the United States of America.
American Youth Hostels, since its inception in
1934, has fostered international understanding by
arranging sponsored trips each year to Canada,

DECEMBER 1950

EurOpe, Latin America and North Africa. The
thousands of young pe0ple who have returned from
these visits constitute a growing, widely-distributed
group who have shared with many others their ex-
periences in international living. Through friendly
association and travel with the youth of other
countries, they have gained insight and deep-
rooted friendships which are denied most travelers
abroad. Greeted everywhere as citizens of this
commonwealth of youth, their outlook has gained
wider dimensions.

The program offered by American Youth Hos-
tels is directed to young people in these “in-be—
tween” years. It opens new vistas to them in an
unique plan that not only feeds imagination and
love of adventure, but encourages initiative and
responsibility.

Hosteling is not a Spectator sport. What it of-
fers is neither soft nor easy. Its simple and often
rugged life demands energy, self-reliance, tolerance
and a sharing of experience.

Hostelers become strong in body and in spirit.
Time spent on the open road, in fraternal asso-
ciation with other young people in this country and
abroad, helps hostelers become better adults.

New NRA Office Manager

VVALDO R. HAINSWORTH,_
former National Recreation
Association district repre-
sentative for the New Eng-
land area, has taken on the
job of office manager at na-
tional headquarters.

Before coming to the as-
sociation in 1946, Mr. Hains-
worth served as superin-
tendent of recreation in Nor-
folk, Virginia. In 1933, a year before graduation
from Randolph Macon College, where he majored
in mathematics and physics, he received his initial
professional experience in the public recreation
field with the House of Industry in Philadelphia.
It was his responsibility, during summer after-
noons, to block off one of the side streets in South
Philadelphia and conduct street play for com-
munity children. In the evenings, he conducted
family recreation activities.

Relief work with the Norfolk Ferry Company
in 1936 led to a position in the public welfare de-
partment and, a year later, to the appointment as
superintendent of the Norfolk Municipal Hospital.
where he organized a recreation program for the
older people in the institution.

Have you ever tried setting aside one particular
spot—maybe a cardtable in the middle of the
room, or at the right-hand corner of the stage—
for a supply base? Place all the tools, material
and equipment at this spot and let the workers,
before they start, see just what is available. Re-
mind them that each and every article is to be
returned the very minute it is not in use. (Some
people even place little slips of paper upon the table
or stage, indicating exactly to which spot the ma—
terial should be returned.) You’ll be surprised

(If you do use the last, remember to buy flame—

a little more, but will be well worth it. Keep the
paper away from light bulbs and avoid using
candles. Of course, no one needs to remind you
to check the wiring on your Christmas tree lights,
or do they?) Try to remember that boughs and
even whole trees can be sprayed with a prepared
solution procured from your local fire department.
In fact, the'fire department might even send one
of its members to do the Spraying. If you don’t see
him do it, you’ll never know it’s been done because
the appearance of your decorations won’t be al—

So plan your gayest and best parties! Don’t
stick to the run—of-the-mill Christmas parties.
Select the traditional aspects of them—but add a
little special something. The air is filled with sur-
prises, anticipation and excitement. Have your
parties as jolly, as new and as exciting as the rest
of the season.

A Wassail Hour

Have you ever gone—or asked your friends to
go—a-wassailing? It’s an old Christmas custom.
The wassail is a hot, spicy punch. (You can find
recipes for it in almost any book of Christmas
cookery!) A big punch bowl of this and little
plates of Christmas cookies or fruit cake are all
that you need for a most successful “wassail hour.”

There’s a college president in northern Vermont
who opens her room each year during the holiday
season to the students for their “wassail hour.” It’s
one of the big events on their calendar! The en—
tire neighborhood shares in the excitement since
the students, as they trudge gaily up the snow—
covered hill, sing aloud that old Christmas carol,
“Here We Come A-VVassailing!” An invitation
to just plain punch and cookies could never arouse
one-half the feeling that an invitation to “a was—
sail hour” can. Try it out on your friends this
year and see for yourself!

A Make-It-Yourself Party

This same college president also delights the
senior students each year by giving a “Make-It-
Yourself Party.”

In her over-all planning, she allocates several
rooms in her home for “workshops.” One large
room is kept free of debris and is the place where
the finished articles find their way to the foot of
the small Christmas tree which serves as a center-
piece on the luncheon table.

The day of the party she‘sets several cardtables
around the “workshop” section of the house. Upon
these she places large bundles of carefully-selected
material which she has been saving all through the
year. She also places a sample of the article that
can be made from this material as well as a
complete set of directions, in case any questions
should arise.

DECEMBER 1950

N 0 one is told to which table he should go but,
as he enters the house, he draws a card from a box
near the door. This carries the name of some other
guest for. whom he is to make a present during the
afternoon. He keeps the name secret, of course,
but looks over all the tables and decides which
“present” would be most welcome to his “name.”
Then he rolls up his sleeves, probably ties on a
big apron which the thoughtful hostess has pro-
vided, and gets to work!

One table may have little acorns, pipe cleaners,
scraps of leather, paint and brushes as well as two
or three attractive sample boutonniere or lapel
gadgets made from these materials.

Another may have small branches of Spruce,
little pine cones, berries, jars of tempora and rolls
of bright red ribbon. The assortment of corsages
which could be made here would delight any girl.

There’s a table for every type—young, old, man,
woman. But although these tables change each
year according to the age and interests of the
group to be present, there are two or three tables
which remain constant year after year.

One is the wrapping table. Here are all the
papers, strings, ribbons, cards, seals, stickers and
writing material which anyone would ever need
to wrap and label his present once it is completed.
With so much material from which to choose, no
two people would ever turn out identical packages.

There’s much excitement around this table as
each person tries, without giving away his secret,
to write on his present the name he drew at the
door. Just like children, all the guests want to
know in advance who’s giving them a present—
and what it is. The wrapper has a hard time keep-
ing his secret!

Another table to which everyone goes sooner or
later is the name card table. Here each person
makes a card bearing the name he drew at the
door. But you should see the cards! Always dif-
ferent—always delightful. One year they con-
sisted of little pocketbook mirrors. These were to
be placed flat upon the table. A very small red
candle—hardly larger than the traditional birthday
type—was slightly melted at the bottom and
mounted on a corner of the mirror. Then the per-
son’s name was painted in tempora upon the mirror.
Some folks added little pieces of spruce to the base
of the candle and very novel name cards appeared.

When each guest has finally completed his pres-
ent, wrapped and tagged it, and has his name card
ready to be placed upon the table, he goes into
another room—the one that looks so calm and
clean after the clutter and excitement of the work-
shop rooms. Here, upon a large table that has already

373

been set for luncheon, he places his name card
and his present. The present goes under the Christ—
mas tree which serves as a centerpiece, and the
name card is set any place he chooses.

Having completed the “necessities,” the guest is
now free to work on table or tree decorations. He
may join the group in the kitchen melting old
candle ends, pouring the hot wax into star-shaped
cookie molds and thereby creating novel Christmas
lamps. His job may consist only of holding a
little piece of string upright while the hot wax
is poured around it in the mold. But when that
little light gleams brightly on the luncheon table,
he is just as proud of it and as pleased with him-
self as if he had made the whole thing.

Perhaps he joins the group that is making
Christmas tree ornaments from old cracked ping-
pong balls and small pine cones. With a touch of
gold, silver or bright paint, these little articles
make most attractive and acceptable tree orna-
ments—particularly for a small tree such as the
one upon the luncheon table.

If he’s tired of painting and puttering, he may
draw up a hassock to the fireplace and help with
the corn popping project that is being carried on
there. Someone else may do the stringing and
arranging of the corn upon the tree. (All of them,
we’re sure, Will eat a good share.)

Sooner or later, everyone goes into the other
room for lunch. The table by this time is festive,
gay and well-ladened. In addition to all else, the
important matter of FOOD has been settled.

Dishes of stuffed olives and pickles help carry
out the red and green color scheme. Tomatoes and
green peppers are stuffed with turkey or chicken
salad. Cranberry sauce and other red jellies add
not only to the menu, but to the picture as well.
Everything is delicious and delightful to the eye.

At. just the right moment, old Saint Nick ap-
pears and distributes the presents from under the
tree. People don their corsages, lapel gadgets and
other gifts—all the while trying to guess who made
these for them! '

When St. Nick’s task is completed, he bustles
off with many hearty Christmas Wishes for one
and all. (Later, he may slip back in through an-
other door——- this time just as a guest at a wonder—
ful party, joining the others as they sit around the
fire singing Christmas carols.)

All good things must end—and, eventually, so
must this party, too. But the memory of it, the
joy of having made something, the thrill of build-
ing a party as it progressed—these will last for
many a long day. When the guests look back upon
it they’ll realize that, except for the refreshments,
the hostess spent not much money but a great deal
of time and thought. The spirit of Christmas, the
idea of giving a little of themselves with each gift,
the knowledge that someone has made something
especially for them, will glow in their hearts long
after Christmas has passed. Within them there will
bubble up a little song much like the ones they sang

at the party!

Christmas Tree Guideposts . . .

Neenah, Wisconsin, has a novel way of disposing of its Christmas trees each

year. When Lake Winnebago freezes over during the months of late December,

January and early February, the banks are dotted with ice fishermen’s shelter

shacks. The snow gets deep and the ice, too, and when there is a fog with low

cloud formation over the lake, the fishermen have a difficult time finding their way

back to their'homes on shore. Last year, the police and Neenah Chamber of Com-

merce conceived the idea of collecting used Christmas trees soon after the holiday

and placing them about twenty to thirty feet apart, upright in the snow, on both

sides of the road leading far out into the middle and end of the lake area to guide

fishermen to their homes each night. The results? No casualties; easy and helpful

disposal of the trees. When the spring thaw comes, the trees are- chopped up by

breaking ice and settle at the bottom of the lake.

Grandmother A, aged seventy-three, has dis-
covered a place for herself in the stream of life,
and she has found the courage to claim her right
to keep it. But she isn’t the only one. There are
thousands of other oldsters who have made the
same discovery.

None of them dreamed six years ago that their
social day was dawning instead of drawing to a
close. Certainly Mr. B didn’t. In the south section
of the city, he lived in a tiny single room in a

boardinghouse, where he was not allowed to linger

in the halls nor in the parlor. When he left his
room, he had to go out-of-doors. Of course, on
sunny days, he sometimes found other loungers
with whom to visit. When it' stormed or was cold,
however, he had just his own four walls to keep
him company. Sometimes he could stand it no
longer. “Walls, I’ve had enough of you I” he’d say,
put on his hat and go into the street. He had to do
something with his time.

Now Mr. C, on the other hand, lived in one of
Philadelphia’s most expensive residential hotels.
He could sit in the luxurious lobby of this or any
other hotel of his choice. He usually spent some
time in Florida each year, but this only bored him.
Although he had time to go somewhere, he had a
deep feeling of not belonging anywhere. He found
other older retired men with whom he could talk,
but such conversations were often pointless, being
mostly about food that they hadn’t enjoyed in the
places they’d been.

Elderly Miss D lived in the north section of
the city. There was nothing at all wrong with her
health or her spirits. Her time went to waste. be-
cause she was now totally blind. Her radiant spirit

375

was so contagious, however, that neighbors often
dropped in to visit, and went away refreshed. She
loved to hear people laugh -the more the merrier.
She specialized in dispensing cheer and humorous
stories. She had much more time to use in this
way! —given the opportunity.

It was recognized back in 194.4 that there was a
great need to offer these and other older citizens
of Philadelphia the opportunity to fill their leisure
time with companionship and interesting activity.
Forces went to work in recreational, health, wel-
fare and religious circles, and it was decided that
Philadelphia should start a recreation program for
its citizens sixty-five years of age and over. The
Philadelphia Recreation Association was asked to
undertake this project, and the Community Chest
to allocate a small amount to the budget of this
Red Feather agency. The association followed
through by securing the services of a specialist to
promote and organize a city-wide program for
older folks.

Today, in this three-county area, there are sixty-
eight clubs and classes of older people with an ag-
gregate attendance of 62,978. These groups are
located in public recreation centers, settlements,
church and synagogue centers, YWCA’s and
YMCA’s, homes for the aged, a community coun-
cil and a Veterans of Foreign Wars post. One
all-day center has been opened for the aged, and
other community areas are planning to follow suit.
These neighborly gatherings are meeting a great
need in their widely-diversified neighborhoods.

There are almost three thousand pe0ple like Mr.
B. M r. C. and Miss D who are now enrolled in a
Golden Age group, where they are finding ways
of turning the time on their hands into the time
of their lives.

Mr. B now has a place to go any time he so de-
sires. He is always the first to arrive at the center
on his club meeting days and the last to leave. He
arranges the chairs for his Golden Age Club and
always helps serve refreshments with an air of
gallant hospitality. Sometimes he mends the chil-
dren’s toys at the center, and enjoys watching them
being used in the play rooms. He frequently joins

a game of checkers within the newly-found walls.
He always finds things to do.

Mr. C had indigestion when he was first intro—
duced, but these days it doesn’t bother him. He’s
made some new friends at the center who haven’t
been to Florida. When they asked him to describe
it to them he had no trouble at all. This led to
bringing in an all-but-forgotten collection of shells
from the Gulf beaches. How was he to know that
this would lead to the club’s decision to give a
hobby show? Or how could he have known he’d
be made the chairman of the affair?

A gale of laughter breaks out in the corner of
the club room where Miss D sits. She is in the
limelight now and has an appreciative audience.
She has just whipped out an old battered felt hat,
bent it into a silly shape and clapped it upon her
head at a ridiculous angle. By now she has estab-
lished her reputation as the club wit. Her aged
friends expect her to have something new to spring
on them each time they meet———a story, a poem
or a joke. Her mind is more than occupied think-
ing up things. The merriment she creates is her
reward.

Older men and women flock to most of the meet-
ing places, where they find a group of their con-
temporaries with whom they can chat, work and
play. They have found a niche into which they fit
at long last. They have found a group of people
who like and understand them. Finding the place
and the people, they are also finding, an infinite
number of ways to use their leisure time.

They choose to play together—as other people
do—by dancing, singing, playing games, going on
picnics, giving parties, holding contests, playing or
listening to instrumental music, participating in
charades, bowling or billiards. They crack jokes
and cut up. They also prefer creative activities
such as painting, ceramics, crafts, poetry and prose
composition, or speech making. They usually
choose to render many services to others accord-
ing to their individual capacities. They visit the
sick, sew for the Red Cross and the blind, make
layettes, help collect funds for charity, contribute
their skill—whether it’sbaking a cake, mending a
chair, or putting on a home talent skit for the en-
tertainment of others. There is a seemingly un-
limited variety of activities and occupations which
older people enjoy because they choose them and,
later, can participate in carrying them out. This
gives them a double sense of satisfaction.

These activities and the program being pro—
moted in Philadelphia come under the heading of
“recreation,” and are generally known and em-
ployed by practitioners of group work and recre—

ation everywhere. Some time ago it was known
that well—selected and directed recreation can build
character and create healthy attitudes in the young.
Now it is known that it can restore many older
human beings to mental health and social useful-
ness. This is the most exciting discovery of recre-
ation and leisure-time programs for older people.
It turns out to be, in fact, a program of re-creation.

Another thing that has been discovered is the
fact that all kinds of older people respond to the
opportunity to have recreation. Because the Phila-
delphia Recreation Association aims at locating
club centers in as many communities as possible,
all kinds of people are being reached in their own
neighborhoods.

\Vhen Philadelphia began this plan, there were
an estimated 136,000 persons over sixty—five years
of age. N 0 buildings and no funds were set aside
to operate programs for them. There were no tools
and no rules to follow in the experimental stage.
No program materials specifically planned for this
age group were available. It was a complex un-
dertaking, made possible by an abundance of good
will.

The job in Philadelphia was undertaken at first

by a few courageous churches and by a dynamic
settlement director. Other agencies and organiza-
tions followed. Offering their facilities and fur-
nishing leadership, they usually assembled a group
of sponsors and volunteers. These lay and profes-
sional people deserve full credit. They are the
ones, each in his own center, who gave the de-
voted care, content and stability to the program.
They stretched their budgets, their facilities and
their hearts to take in the oldsters. They are the
stars of this “Philadelphia story.”

In all types of smaller communities, this pro-
gram has been found to work by combining the
facilities, the services and the good will at hand.
One club of community oldsters meets in the gra—
cious setting of the Charles Knox Home (for the
aged) in lush suburban Wynnewood on the Main
Line. In Pottstown, the recreation commission
furnishes the leadership and the materials; while

the YWCA gives its facilities.

Just one public-spirited citizen can be the spark
to ignite community interest, as in Lansdale, where
a retired businessman made a personal contribu-
tion and got four of the local women’s clubs to
sponsor a group of 125 older townspeople.

Two religious groups can combine in a har-
monious way to provide for their community’s
aged, as is being demonstrated in a heartening way
by the York Road Section of the Council of jew-
ish \Vomen and the Grace Presbyterian Church in

378

jenkintown. The council provides the funds, gives
voluntary assistance at meetings and hires a leader;
the church gives its facilities.

There are many reasons why any community
can and should provide recreation opportunities
for its elderly. One reason is well-stated in the
Philosophy of Recreation at the National Confer-
ence on the Aging:

“The percentage of elderly people in the popu-
lation has grown and is growing steadily; the so-
ciety in which they find themselves becomes more
complex and the strains and stresses of life in-
crease. The vital importance of provision of op-
portunity for oldsters to find gratification and pur-
posefulness in their living becomes obvious. The
most plentiful and precious commodity the aging

have is TIME.”

Suggestions for Leaders of Games*

It may not be immediately evident in a
newly-assembled group of older people
just what level of game they will enjoy
most. Games range all the way from the
fish pond and pick-up sticks to those
which require cultural and intellectual re-
sources of the players—such as chess, ana—
grams, bridge and guessing games on liter—
ature, history, drama and so forth.

In a comparatively illiterate group, one
would not use a game which requires read-
ing or writing. Other older persons find
prolonged concentration very fatiguing,
such as in a game of Chinese Checkers. It
is very important to find at least one game
that each person enjoys playing. Then let
him play it to his heart’s content. Later,
introduce him to other games as soon as
he is ready. Watch his reaction to the
new game. If he appears bored and thinks
it is “too easy,” give the game up at once.
Likewise, if it.seems too difficult, it will
discourage him. A healthy appetite for
play is not built upon the attitudes of dis—
couragement nor contempt. It is up to the
leader to keep these attitudes from devel-
0ping on the part of the players.

Random Notes from Discussion Meetings

CONGRESS CAPSULES

How to Live with Television—Friend or Foe?

It was acknowledged that TV can be a friend—-
that good recreation leaders need not suffer from
competition, but rather should accept the respon—
sibility of finding ways of integrating it into pro-
gram, of using it as a means of promoting partici-
pation instead of allowing it to aggravate “specta-
toritis.” It was agreed that it has a great potential
as a resource—part of which is in the hands of rec-
reation leaders and part in the hands of produc—
ers. Group thinking considered it in terms of:

a. Producing programs
b. Using TV as a motivating factor for pro-
gram.

It was decided that demonstration and discrim-
ination are two key words for recreation pe0ple to
keep in mind. In demonstration, a televised pro-
gram can bring specific skills close to the eyes of
the audience, show up small details. Through
demonstration, use groups—for example, an arts
and crafts group—can be expanded to include the
entire TV audience. Other activities, such as fo-
rums, parties, clubs can be activated. In discrim-
ination, recreation leaders must accept responsi-
bility and bring inHuence to bear on programs
given or selection of programs to watch.

How Can Recreation Agencies Realize More
Fully the Recreation Possibilities of Drama?

It was emphasized in this meeting that too often
community theatre groups are isolated in the rec-
reation department; whereas they should be a
clearing house, bringing together all local resources
—-PTA’s, Junior Leagues, and so on.

A debate arose as to whether it is possible to
maintain a community theatre, run and enjoyed
principally by and for community participants,
without having it get out of hand and turn com—
mercial with an emphasis on “art for art’s sake.”
The danger seems to be that the interest of partici-

DECEMBER 1950

pants tends to simmer down to the training of a
few experts for the purpose of turning out pro-
fessionally-finished productions, rather than to em-
phasize the participation and enjoyment of the
many in a joint community project. The latter is
done successfully in England (see page 359).

All present also agreed that there is a dearth of
plays suitable for community groups and that
many recreation leaders are forced to write their
own. It was suggested that the National Recrea—
tion Association ask for copies of such locally-
written plays which have been successfully pro-
duced and, after careful screening, make them
available to all. Good teen-age comedies especially
are needed. This same plea for plays was regis-
tered at the National Theatre Conference.

Creative Program Planning for Older Age
Groups.

Basic recommendations to leaders in this field:

I. The needs of the older person should be care-
fully understood.

2. The present dearth of trained leadership
could be alleviated with workshops and institutes.
The age of the leader of older groups is less im-
portant than his personality and skills.

3. It is time for all of us to stop and think how
far are we going in the segregation of age groups.
If we develop a comprehensive program for all
age levels, special emphasis on any one group,
whether youth or elderly, will be unnecessary.

4. Use should be made of the good printed mate—
rials now available.

5. Care should be taken not to exclude the older
person from the planning of program. One can-
not superimpose plans upon this age level.

6. Camping for this group is a fairly new expe-
rience. It has been tried in Cleveland (see RECREA-
TION, March 1950, page 573), New York C it}:
and several other communities, but it was felt that

379

it was really an outdoor experience rather than
real camping.

7. Care should be taken not to pamper such a
group too much, as members have much to con-

tribute.

8. More thinking should be done in terms of the
home-bound and institutionalized.

Standards for Sports and Athletic Programs
in Community Recreation.

The first question raised—“\V hat should be the
position of local recreation departments on the
conducting of competitive athletic activities for
boys under twelve ?”—took up the entire session.

In regard to Little League baseball, it was
brought out that there are now some three hundred
fifty Little Leagues, with over thirteen hundred
teams participating. The recreation and athletic
directors present came out pretty strongly as be-
ing against the Little League as a function of
municipal recreation, stating as objections: that
youngsters at the age of twelve are not psycho-
logically nor physiologically prepared for tourna-
ment participation and the attendant emotional
stress; that it is a disturbing influence on the rec-
reation program and that baseball should be kept
on a recreation level; that it is an unnecessary
and lavish expenditure of funds which leads to
subsidization and proselyting too early in years.

A vote of those present resulted as follows:

In Favor Opposed
Little League . . . . . . . . . . . . . . l 31
City league organized to the
recreational level . . . . . . . . . . . 42 t 1
Controlled Sponsors, and oper-
ated by recreation department 28 6

In considering tackle football for the same age,
Fred Coombs, of Pennsylvania State College, read
a report from:

I) The Office of Education criticizing it for this
age level because of a) physiological factors, b)

psychological factors, c) safety factors, d) eco-
nomic factors ;

2) The American Medical Association which
said, in brief: “Play and physical education con-

tribute much to the health of children but there
must be certain precautions and protective meas-
ures. . . Interschool athletic leagues should be
confined to the senior high school. Interschool ac-
tivities for junior high school pupils should be
limited to occasional invitational meets or games.
Junior high school boys should not compete in
American football. Encourage play days, but no
school championships.”

3) The Federal Security Agency, which stated
that “highly organized competitive athletic leagues
are not desirable for children and youth of ele-
mentary and junior high school age (grades one
to eight) . . . All athletic competition should be
conducted in accordance with the needs, capabili-
ties and interests of growing children.” I

Upon the reading of these, the meeting—the at-
tendance of which had grown to over one hundred
—really went to town in heated debate. It was
pointed out that at one time there had been rec-
ommendations that we, in the recreation field, be
guided by scientific research; but these had failed
to carry weight because such recommendations had
not come from recreation authorities. Therefore,
it was suggested that the American Recreation
Society and the National Recreation Association
form a joint committee to work on this and at—
tempt to come up with a sound policy which would
be the basis for the operation of municipal recrea-
tion department programs not only in tackle foot-
ball, but in baseball as well. ,

It was also suggested at this time that more
utilization be made of carry-over value activities
rather than of big muscle activities, and it was
recommended that the National Recreation Asso-
ciation appoint a national committee from the rec-
reation field to make a study of this matter and to
report its findings and recommended policy to
the 195I convention. This suggestion was ap-
proved unanimously.

A vote was taken as to those who were in favor
of supervised football for boys under twelve, re-
sulting in:

In Favor Opposed
Twelve and under . . ._ . . . . . . . 16 34
Fourteen and under . . . . . . .. 18 18

0U must have met him in Cleveland during the

Midcentury National Recreation Congress.
For the sake of the record, let’s call him Phil Fil-
bert, even though a recreation screwball of this
type by any other name would be as wacky.

Surely you must have met him at the Statler.
He’s the guy 'who pounded you on the back just
as you were gulping one of those free Pepsies or
Cokes, causing you nearly to choke to death. After
the lusty wallop on the back, he would start out:

“\Vell, well, well, if it isn’t my old friend Barney
Greasespot. How ya doing, old pal? Haven’t seen
you since New Orleans. Now, there was a town!”

While you wipe the spilled drink from your coat
lapel, he keeps up an endless chit chat from which
you learn that he just blew into Cleveland, a day
after the opening of the congress.

“\Vhat’s new around this hamlet?” he inquires
in a loud voice as he steps on your pet corn and
reaches across your chest for some of that free
liquid. And, before you have a chance to say any-

thing, he bursts out, “Oh, oh, giving away minia-
ture baseball bats, eh? Got to get one of those for
the kid. ’Scuse me a minute.”

As he barges over to pick up a bat, you know
he’s not after a souvenir. Some night club table
will take an awful pounding that night, making the
proprietor take a little less interest in that game
we Americans fondly call the national pastime.

While Phil Filbert is after his night club toma-
hawk you duck away, h0ping that perhaps Phil,
somehow, somewhere, will get lost in the shufi‘ie.
But do you shake him off? Not for all the water
in Lake Huron. '

He catches up with you at one of the afternoon
panels. He may not be sitting next to you but
somewhere he’s in the group. As the discussion
leaders or other qualified speakers discuss with
great wisdom some important phase of recreation,
leave it to old Phil Filbert to ask for the floor so
that he may tell his side of the case for one and all
to hear.

“Now in Pinkburg,” he starts out, “our recrea-
tion department runs playgrounds for boys and
girls and we have sand bins, storytelling hours and
all kinds of things like that. Our delinquency rate

381

has been cut in half and . . .”—blah, blah, blah!
On and on he goes, never appreciating the fact that
his story has been told and retold a thousand
times in the past. And, of course, never taking
time to realize that he’s as far off the subject as an
elephant would be in a Kentucky Derby.

Somehow everyone seems to maintain his de—
corum even though, inwardly, committing mayhem
on the person of one Phil Filbert is uppermost in
his thoughts.

Phil also makes his presence strongly felt on
the tours, at the training courses and exhibits.
"You ought to see that gym of ours in Pinkburg,”
he spouts off like an executive secretary in some
chamber of commerce as he inspects the home
community’s facilities. “It would make this one
look like a clothescloset. And our wading pool!
Brother, you should get a load of that. Now, our
sandboxes . . .”—blah, blah, blah! He’s off again
in the best of vocal trim.

As for dancing, well, there’s never a dull mo—
ment when Phil is in the Grand Ballroom. Nor
are there many untrod toes. He’s the guy who
goes into the waltz while giving the impression
he’s trying out the Minnesota shift. He dashes

around with a stalk of flowers, playing the part of
a robber as gracefully as a rhinoceros doing a
rhumba. Yes, he even swirls the comely Mrs.
Prendergast around the ballroom as though she
were his old college girl friend back at the Senior
prom.

The Congress banquet, of course, would not be
a banquet without Phil on hand to provide that
added atmosphere. As surely as the sun rises and
sets, some time during the course of the dinner he
will bump into a waiter, causing hot soup to be
spilled onto your friend’s best suit or onto your
own newly-pressed gabardine. Or he’ll stretch
across and haul in those last three patties of butter,
just when you had your heart set on one of them.
And that smoke he blows your way—well, that
two-for-a-nickel perfecto Phil is drawing on would
make an ideal smudge for your next lawn party
in the Everglades.

Yes, good old Phil is quite a character. There’s
one at every convention, and you can take him.
But, while taking him, please furnish him with a
one-way ticket to the Fiji Islands. On second
thought, please pardon me. Why wish something

like Phil on the Fiji Islands!

 

National Conference on State Parks

-Two HUNDRED DELEGATES from twenty-three
states attended the thirtieth annual National
Conference on State Parks, October 5-10, this year.
Texas, as host, planned a program which began at
Bastrop State Park near Austin and ended at Big
Bend National Park.

Frank Quinn, of the Texas State Parks Board,
was elected president of the conference, succeed-
ing Tom Morse, superintendent of State Parks in
North Carolina. Other newly—elected officials in-
clude Vice-Presidents Charles DeTurk, of the
\Vashington State Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion; Arthur Elmer, chief of the Parks and Recre-
ation Division of the Michigan Department of Con-
servation ; and board of directors members James
Segrest of Alabama, Herbert Maier of California,
Kenneth Coughill of Indiana, Henry Ward of
Kentucky, Abner Gwinn of Missouri, and Mrs.
Ruth Peeler of Washington.

Former Governor Pat Morris Neff of Texas,
who has been frequently called “Father of State
Parks in Texas,” gave one of the principle
speeches, as did Dr. George J. Albrecht, of the
New York State College of Forestry. Conrad L.
Wirth, of the National Park Service, presented a
paper on “The Place of Parks in the Land Use

382

Program,” and suggested that the states restudy
and modernize the “Park, Parkway and Recrea-
tional Area Programs,” prepared in 193.7, and give
more recognition to historic sites.

Conference reports generally seemed to empha-
size the fact that the states are doing a great deal
toward expanding facilities, as well as providing
larger maintenance appropriations. The constantly-
increasing attendance, as compared with the grad-
ual leveling-off- in the national parks, indicates that
people are recognizing more and more the value
of such facilities close at home.

The National Conference on State Parks plans
to hold its 1951 meeting in Ohio, probably at
Zaleski State Park, near Athens, the week of
October ninth.

THE USE OF

SCHOOL BUILDINGS
FOR RECREATION

PART II

The attempt was made to determine the extent to
which boards of education share the costs of open-
ing school buildings for community recreation use,
and the charges made to recreation departments.
for. the use of school buildings.

Eighty-five recreation departments of the 105
studied reported receiving no board of education
funds, although it- is evident that the school au-
thorities in many of these cities are contributing
to the maintenance or other operating costs of the
school recreation centers. In twenty of the com-
munities the recreation department receives funds
from or through the local board of education. (In
each of the only two instances specifled, the amount
received was $5,000.) These funds received do not,
in all cases, represent appropriations by the local
boards of education. In Pennsylvania, where five
of the twenty cities so reporting are located, the
State Department of Public Instruction reimburses
local school districts for certain expenditures for
recreation leadership. In the state of washing-
ton, where two communities reported appropria-
tions, similar reimbursement is made to school
districts by state education authorities.

383

Nine of the twenty recreation departments re-

ceiving school funds are required to make no pay-
ments for the use of school buildings; six others
pay the cost of custodians; three, of other school

 

 
 

personnel; and two pay rental charges. A much
greater proportion of the twenty departments that
receive board of education funds (35.0%) have
free use of school buildings than of the eighty-five
that receive no such funds (16.5%).

Among the eighty-five departments receiving no
appropriations from the board of education, nine-
teen make no payment for the use of schools. Four
of these report that their local boards of education
carry substantial “recreation” items in the school
budget. In Mount Vernon, New York, for ex-

ample, there is a $6,000 item for light, heat and
custodial service.

The payments required of recreation depart-
ments in the 105 communities which comprise the
sampling can be summarized as follows:

28 or 26.6% pay nothing for the use of school
buildings

23 or 21.9% pay only for custodians employed
by the schools. (Two of these pay only for
“extra” custodians when needed.)

12 or 11.4% pay rent by the season or the
period r

14 or 13.3% pay rent plus other charges, as for
the custodians

10 or 9.5% pay for heat and light plus other
charges

16 or 15.3% pay other combinations of charges
2 or 1.9% reported conflicting data

As the preceding table indicates, more than a
fourth of the recreation departments reporting pay
nothing for the use of school buildings; the others
either meet the cost of opening the buildings or
share the expense with the school officials. The

most common type of required payment is for cus-
todial service, either separately or in combination

384

with other charges such as for heat and light;
others are payments for noncustodial school per—
sonnel required to be employed, or in the form of
rent by the season or for each use of space. Sixty-
one of the 105 departments report paying for the
repair of damaged property but it seems probable
that all assume this obligation. Under “other re-
quired payments,” five departments reported rental
fees required only'when admissions are charged
and three reported charges only for certain facili-
ties at certain hours.

Other means of sharing with boards of educa-
tion the cost of recreation programs were reported
by seventeen departments. In five instances, the
recreation use of school buildings is reciprocated
by school use of recreation properties; in three, the
cost of the full-time recreation executive’s salary
is shared by the schools. Others reported are:
sharing the cost of the after-school program or
adult school; purchase of certain types of equip-
ment for use by both agencies; provision of staff
by the recreation department for school-operated
swimming pools; sharing of profits from teen-age
dances; and furnishing of liability insurance (by
a private agency conducting community program)
to protect the school board.

Minimum Personnel Required by'Boards of Education

The requirement that certain personnel be pres-
ent when schools are open for recreational use
can be a highly important factor in the recreation
budget and in the relationship of school and recre-
ation authorities. The findings show that boards
of education are reasonable in this respect; in most
cases, the required personnel is less than the rec-
reation department would need to provide in order
to conduct its program.

Of the 104 departments responding to this ques—
tion, thirty (28.8%) reported no minimum per-
sonnel required to be present; the determination of
staff adequacy is wholly in the hands of the recre-
ation authorities. Ten boards of education (9.6%)
require one custodian to be present and two others
require two custodians, depending upon the facili-
ties in use. Three set the minimum requirement at
one certificated teacher while one other requires
a “teacher” or leader for each group. In twenty-
one communities (20.2%) the requirement is one
adult recreation leader only. Twenty-three
(22.1%) require a custodian and a recreation
leader. The remaining fourteen communities re-
quire different combinations of personnel up to
“ten persons” in one instance.

In only fifteen or one-seventh of the communi-

RECREATION

ties reporting does the board of education establish
definite qualifications for recreation personnel used
in school buildings. In Pennsylvania communities
receiving reimbursement from the State Depart-
ment of Public Instruction, for example, the re-
quirement is a teacher’s certificate. The remaining
eighty-nine communities indicated that no board
of education qualifications are in effect for recrea-
tion personnel used in school buildings.

A frequency count of the personnel most often
required to be present in the seventy-four commu-
nities reporting such requirements shows that one
or more adult leaders are required in fifty-three in-
stances, one or more custodians in forty-six in-
stances and one or more teachers or other quali-
Fied school employees in seven instances. Center
director, attendants, engineers, and “persons” are
each specified in not more than five instances. Ex-
cept for custodians, who are generally needed for
building operation, a substantial number of boards
of education are willing to entrust the use of school
properties to recreation personnel and specify a
smaller minimum number of workers than are
usually required for effective recreation service.

Administrative Arrangements for Cooperation

Because the operation of school recreation cen-
ters involves cooperative relationships between
school and recreation departments, an attempt was
made to learn what administrative devices have
been set up to facilitate such cooperation. The na-
ture of the administrative arrangements in effect
and the frequency of their use are revealed by the
following table which indicates the number of cities
reporting the use of the devices listed:

5t Membership of school board member(s) on
recreation boards*

42 Periodic joint meetings of school and recrea-
tion administrative staff members

27 Regular assignment of school employees to
the recreation staff

22 Joint meetings of school and recreation
boards

20 Joint employment of administrative person-
nel by both agencies

DECEMBER 1950

IO Regular assignment of recreation employees

9 Member of school staff on recreation board“

The preceding summary shows clearly that the
most widely used methods of facilitating coopera-
tion are membership of school board and staff per-
sonnel on the recreation board, joint board and
staff meetings and joint employment or use of
school and recreation workers.

It is significant that in eighty-eight, or five out
of six, of the cities reporting one or more adminis-
trative arrangements are used for securing cooper-
ation ; in only seventeen was the use of no such de-
vice reported. Of the eighty-eight communities,
forty-one listed only one administrative arrange-
ment each, but the remaining forty-seven reported
using on an average of three devices each. The most
frequent combination was membership of school
board members on the recreation board together
with some other devices, such as joint staff meeting
or joint employment of administrative personnel.

Of the many explanations written in, seventeen
were to the effect that the employment of school
personnel as leaders, although not required, is
definitely helpful in keeping good relations with
the board of education. Two illustrative com-
ments follow:

“The best device is to have the superintendent
of schools understand and be in accord with your
program and policy. This can only be accomplished
by careful supervision of programs and the school
property.”

“Monthly joint meetings of the superintendent
of recreation, the superintendent of schools, the
director of physical education and the director of
buildings and grounds are held to discuss mutual
interests and problems.”

Appraisal of Procedures

The opinion of the recreation executives was
asked as to the factors which they believe con-
tribute most significantly to the success of their co-
operation with school authorities in the use of
school buildings. They were also requested to
name the difficulties which threaten, or have threat-
ened, successful cooperation and the procedures
which have proved effective in facing and solving
these difficulties. Because of their number, the re-
sponses have been grouped by categories, rather
than quoted verbatim, and they are listed below,

“Patience ! Friendliness l Diplomacy l”

The responses to the questions designed to ap-
praise the procedures clearly indicate the outstand—
ing importance of two or three factors. A c00pe1‘-
ative spirit, mutual understanding of objectives
and policies and good public relations obviously
contribute to cooperation and the solution of difH—
culties. Absence of these factors, though reported
in surprisingly few cities, hinders c00peration. The
necessity of using buildings which were not
planned for recreational use is by far the most
commonly reported cause of difhculty; whereas
joint participation in planning was reported by
very few cities among factors contributing to coop—
eration, illustrating the lack of such school plan-
ning in the past. The use of conferences and dis-
cussions among all interested parties is obviously
considered a most effective procedure for solving
difficulties. Proper care of school property by rec-
reation workers and adherence to school regula—
tions are other procedures that contribute to cor-
dial relationships. Janitors continue to be a facton
in the successful operation of school centers—al-
though the responses indicate that they do not pre-

sent a major problem in most of the cities which
were reporting.

RECREATION

Responses of School Authori’ries

Only five responses were received to a letter ad-
dressed to the superintendent of schools in each of
the 105 communities, requesting his opinion as to
(a) the factors that have contributed signifi-
cantly to successful cooperation with recreation
authorities in the use of school buildings; (b) the
difficulties that threaten or have threatened such
cooperation, and (c) the procedures that have
been used in facing and solving difficulties. The
replies that were related to these three factors are
given here. They indicate the attitude of at least
three school ofiicials, although it is impossible to
estimate the extent to which these opinions are
shared by superintendents of schools in the other
one hundred cities.

(a) “The use of school facilities is dependent
entirely upon the individual administrator of each
school. Unless he is in accord with, and enthusi-
astic about, the program, there is no chance of hav-
ing a successful program.

(b) “I. Lack of supervision by the recreation
department to protect adequately school property
and facilities. 2. School administrators dislike
turning keys over to recreation
people who are not directly re-
sponsible to school authorities.
3. Poor program planning. 4.
Inefficient playground directors
who serve mainly as “cops,”
rather than as directors of a
planned program.

4%;

(c) “I. A new director of recreation has been
appointed, and he is endeavoring to solve these
problems. 2. The board of education and the city
recreation department have entered into a contract
specifying that school personnel be hired as recre-
ation directors for school playgrounds when avail-

able.”

* * * *

(a) “The fact that three fine new auditorium-
gymnasium combinations were completed in new
buildings and made available for use as of Septem-
ber 1949 proved to be very helpful in meeting our
need for indoor activity. Another factor was the
elimination of charging the park department for the
use of school facilities by the board of education.

(b) “One difficulty, of course, that threatens
the success of cooperation in the use of these is
_that there is always the possibility of property dam-
age, particularly in the new buildings. There are
a few times during the year, also, when a janitor
must be on hand for Opening the building during

DECEMBER 1950

special periods when he normally would not be
there, and payment must be made for this service.

(c) “Representatives of both departments have
met occasionally to discuss various problems which
have confronted us and we have tried to answer
them on a cooperative basis. We are both trying
to serve the youth of this community as broadly
as possible and feel that we can do this best by
mutual assistance.”

* * * =l<

(a) “We feel that the recreation program carried
on by the city’s recreation officer has a definite
place in the activities of all our students after
school hours. We have allowed our gymnasiums,
classrooms, shops, and equipment to be used with
the lowest minimum charge possible to encourage
the program. Many of our teachers are employed
after school hours and during the summer by the
program and have assisted in planning many of the
projects.

(b) “The difficulties that arise from the recre-
ation program are the misuse of equipment and
building by participants. The program attracts
noninterested students and out-of-school people in
and around the buildings, causing damage, dis-
turbance, and mischievous activities that would not
be tolerated in a regular school program.

(c) “An attempt has been made to bring the
recreation officer and building principals together
for a better understanding of the problems in-
volved. We have also encouraged more and better
supervision to handle the program.” (From a bus-
iness manager)

In Conclusion

The schoolhouse has become widely recognized
by school authorities as a building for both school
and community use. Increasingly, recreation de-
partments are being given a share in the planning
of school facilities that are to be used for recrea-
tion by community groups.

In cities with a municipal recreation department,
recreation centers in school buildings are com-
monly conducted by this department rather than
by the school officials themselves. This arrange-
ment assures maximum use of the school plant and
enables the recreation department to conduct a
more diversified program. The findings of this
study make it clear that effective cooperation be-
tween school and recreation authorities is a power-
ful factor in assuring the success of a recreation
center program in a school building.

Nancy Stamcy

OLLOWING six weeks of after-school rehearsals,
Fthe Children’s Theatre of Raleigh has come to
that magic moment when the curtains part! The
auditorium and balcony of Wiley School are
packed to the bursting point with eager, expectant
boys and girls and proud papas and mamas.

The director gives the final “pep” talk to the
cast before curtain time, and a near-professional
group of boys and girls relive an age-old but ever
new story, such as “The Sleeping Beauty” or “Rip
Van Winkle.”

Raleigh is proud—and justly so—of its Chil-
dren’s Theatre, which is now winding up its first
year as a tax—supported part of the city’s recrea-
tion program.

Setting theatre policy is a board of directors
on which the following organizations are repre-
sented by two members each: Junior League of
Raleigh, Junior Woman’s Club, Girl Sco’uts, PTA,
city schools, Raleigh Little Theatre, the recreation
department and one from the city library. Various
committees from these groups handle publicity,
ticket sales, costuming, make-up, scenery, and so
forth. All combine their efforts toward one ulti-
mate goaI—to provide liner plays for children to
see and to act.

During the school months, three major produc-
tions are given, representing a carefully-planned
choice of drama. These plays usually run from one
and a half to one and three-quarters of an hour
and three performances of each are given. Boys
and girls of elementary and high school age do all
the acting.

Plays presented last season were “The Sleeping
Beauty,” a three-act dramatization by Charlotte
B. Chorpenning; “Rip Van Winkle,” a three-act
comedy adapted by Grace Dorcas Ruthenburg;
and “The Indian Captive,” a three—act historical
dramatization by Miss Chorpenning. All of these,
plays meet the high standards set for children’s

plays by members of the Advisory Board of the
Children’s Theatre Press, Anchorage, Kentucky.

The city schools permit use of the Wiley School
auditorium for all rehearsals and productions. The
theatre is open to all Raleigh children, and season
tickets sell for one dollar each. These are made
available through the schools, and entitle a child
to see all three productions and to try out for parts
in the plays. Various civic groups sponsor ad-
missions for children who cannot afford to pay.
Last season, a total of four hundred children tried
out for parts, ninety were cast, and approximately
six thousand attended the productions. More than
two thousand dollars were taken in at the box
office and from the sale of season tickets. All profits
go into a trust fund for a Children’s Theatre
building.

During the school vacation months, a summer
theatre for children is conducted at Wiley School.
Since the summer attendance is a shifting one, a
somewhat elastic drama program is carried on.
Creative dramatics, pantomimes, storytelling and
story dramatizations, stunts, skits and short plays
are developed. Two free public performances are
given. The director chooses material during the

DECEMBER 1950

summer which will contribute most to the de-
velopment and enjoyment of the players. The first
requisite of a summer recreational drama program
is that it entertain those taking part. More than
one hundred fifty boys and girls registered for
summer theatre during 1950.

One of the best evidences of the value of the
summer theatre program is the gratifying carry-
over into the schoolroom. Teachers inform us that
children direct their classmates in the same play-
lets, dramatizations, stunts and skits which they
have learned during the summer. These are given
before PTA’s, school assemblies. civic clubs and
so on.

Although the immediate recreational values are
of first importance, the increased, long—time, rec-
reational potential that comes with real apprecia-
tion is stressed. Every production beautifully done
enriches the lives of all who see it. A good play.
excellently done, takes as much cooperation and
teamwork to achieve as it does to acquire the skills
and play a game of baseball. The theatre for chil—
dren has become an effective means for providing
healthy, creative recreation of the most higth
desirable type.

Public Recreation and Settlements

OOPERATION BETWEEN public recreation agen-
C cies and privately-financed and sponsored so-
cial settlements is nothing unique. It has been a
practice in Cleveland and in other cities for many
years. However, we feel that our three new Cleve-
land projects may prove the possibility of a degree
of cooperation which is so highly developed that
actually, though of course not legally, there has
emerged on the neighborhood level not two agen-
cies which cooperate with each other, but one
agency under joint sponsorship and with the pur-
pose of providing recreation as well as settlement
services.

In the summer of 1948, three Cleveland settle-
ment houses formed the Neighborhood Settlement
Association of Cleveland as their joint and central
administrative agency. At the same time, the
Group Work Council of the Welfare Federation
requested that the Neighborhood Settlement Asso-
ciation, should attempt as far and as fast as finan-
cially possible, to provide settlement services in
three specified areas of the city in greatest need
of such services. Our first move toward realization
of that charge was to approach the coordinator of
recreation of the Joint Recreation Board of the
city of Cleveland and the Cleveland Board of Edu-
cation. In a brief series of sessions, the first plan
for a joint approach in the first area was developed.

In this area, which is interracial in character,
the Board of Education has sponsored, for several
years, a community center at the unior high school,
providing one evening for adults and one evening
for teen-agers under the direction of untrained,
part-time staff. The teen-age night had become the
principle meeting time of youngsters of one of
the several racial groups only, and the principal re-
ceived continuous complaints from parents and
businessmen about the youngsters’ destructive be-
havior. A few blocks away, one of the settlements

sociation had maintained a small settlement branch
with limited program and staff in inadequate and
expensive rented quarters. °
Under the new plan, the settlement branch was
discontinued. The junior high school became the
headquarters of the new joint project and the
Board of Education provided a small classroom
with all utilities as the office for the joint enter-
prise. Furniture for the office was provided by
the Neighborhood Settlement Association, which
also staffed it with a clerical worker. Both the
Board of Education and the Neighborhood Settle-
ment Association then agreed upon the selection
of a well-experienced settlement worker as the
joint director of both parts of the project. This
director is paid by the Board of Education on a
per-session basis, and the Neighborhood Settle-
ment Association guarantees her full salary in
conformity with its own professional personnel
standards; actually, approximately three-quarters
of her annual salary is paid by the Neighborhood
Settlement Association, and one-quarter by the
Board of Education. The board also supplies and
pays the part-time staff directing the recreation
program at the junior high school during the two
evenings for adults and one evening for teen-agers.
The Neighborhood Settlement Association sup-
plies and pays three experienced group workers
whose major assignments are the development and

RECREATION

leadership of social clubs for children, teen-agers
and adults. Most of these clubs meet at the mem-
bers’ homes on a rotating plan; others meet at the
school, which is available for club meetings, with-
out charge, any time when it is open for commu-
nity center purposes. All clubs meet at all times
under professional or supervised volunteer leader—
ship. For any activities which take place in the
junior high school, the Board of Education pro-
vides the facilities and the custodial care.

To provide recreational activities and interest
groups for children, the Board of Education also
provides facilities and custodial care during a total
of three afternoons at two elementary schools; the
Neighborhood Settlement Association provides the
professional staff. .

During the summer months, the director is ap-
pointed by the Joint Recreation Board as the part-
time supervisor of four neighborhood school play-
grounds staffed by the board.

The total membership, which is interracial and
interreligious on all levels, amounts to approxi-
mately one thousand participants, two-thirds of
whom are under eighteen. During the season,
twenty-five social clubs and nineteen interest
groups are active under the Neighborhood Settle-
ment Association’s leadership, with a monthly at-
tendance of approximately two thousand. Nine
recreational and interest groups, with a monthly
attendance of approximately eight hundred, meet
under Board of Education leadership.

After this first project was successfully estab~
lished, similar joint programs were set up in two
additional areas of the city. The arrangements are
basically the same as in the first area except that,
in the second area, the City Division of Recreation
pays three-quarters of the salary of the director
and the Neighborhood Settlement Association,
one-quarter.

What does such a setup mean to the objectives
and functions of the public recreation agencies
and the settlements? We are convinced that it
maintains and strengthens both, and increases and
improves the actual services given to the commu-
nity which sees only the total program and is less
confused by 'separate Sponsorships.

The public recreation program is being in-
creased and improved through the quality of the
staff. Its connection with the settlement neigh-
borhood program adds to the good relationships of
the school with its neighbors. Adults and children
come to respect the school as valuable beyond be-
ing a center of learning. At the same time, the
school authorities remain in ultimate control of
their building through the fact that the director is

DECEMBER 1950

partly their employee—which is an important basis
for the use of school buildings for other than school
purposes.

The major settlement objectives of being an
integrating force in neighborhood relations; of
providing positive group experiences for the whole
family; and of contributing toward the growth of
individuals through such groups and intergroup
experiences are not only fully maintained, but
strengthened in several important ways. With the
major part of the recreation program function of
any settlement carried out by the public recreation
staff, the settlement staff can then concentrate on
other settlement functions. The close relationship
with the school increases settlement value as a
neighborhood relations factor, and thus strengthens
its objectives.

We have heard little doubt expressed about the
fact that the people of the community have most
certainly profited by this pooling of resources.
However, we have been asked whether staff, es-
pecially the director, can work effectively in such
a setup of dual objectives and dual sponsorship.
The answer rests first of all in the fact that the
dual objectives are not only not mutually exclu-
sive, but actually complimentary to each other. The
answer rests further within the sphere of human
relations, the willingness of all people concerned
to work together for the common good, and the
skill of all of them in applying, tactfully and pur-
posely, their knowledge of human behavior to the
variety of human relations involved in the function-
ing of such a project.

It has further been asked how far this kind of
project is generally applicable. The answer de-
pends entirely upon the specific area served, the
needs of its people, and the availability of facili-
ties. An antiquated school building might well
necessitate the construction of a Special settlement
or public recreation building. Essential also is a
conviction on the part of public officials and pro-
fessional workers that better services to the pe0ple
are more important than personal considerations.

There is no claim made that such arrangements
as described are “perfect” or should be the pattern
for all communities or agencies. Several problems
need further study, including that of identification
of the membership with the whole agency or its
parts. Certain settlement activities cannot satis-
factorily be carried on in school buildings. In a
way, the whole project is still in an experimental
stage, and is completing only its second year. \Ve
feel, however, that we have made pr0gress and
that before long we will have the facts with which
to substantiate it.

Community Recreation Centers Series—III

TAKE OFF YOUR

AND '

AND STAY AWHILE!

NE OF THE MAIN objectives of a community
0 center director should be to provide such an
attractive and comfortable atmosphere that folks
will want to come often and stay long.

\Vith this purpose in mind, she sets up a cloak-
room—somewhere in the front of the building and
perhaps in connection with, or in sight of, the reg—
istration desk so that the person in attendance
there can, to some extent, act in a supervisory
capacity.

The reasons for establishing a cloakroom are so
obvious! Rubbers, umbrellas, and outdoor clothing
—wet or otherwise—are not only uncomfortable,
but unnecessary and a nuisance. Participants them—
selves recognize this! In buildings where no pro—
visions are made for checking and care, they take
matters into their own hands by removing their
outer garments and tossing them into any con—
venient corner. Since the clothes are thrown about
so carelessly, they are bound to become wrinkled
in the first place. And after several other partici-
pants, encumbered in their play by heavy gar—
ments, have likewise added to the pile, the wrinkles
are multiplied a hundred fold!

To make a bad situation worse, the first one to
arrive is usually the first one to leave. When he
goes back to the corner—usually at the last minute
——he has difficulty in finding his own garments.
So he just dives into the pile, burrows around un-
til he finds something that looks like his own, pulls
it out, and worries not at all about the condition in
which he has left everyone else’s things. It’s no
surprise that he and all the other folks who were
at the center that day go home looking like rag
.bags. (\Ve wonder that the director of that center

can sleep nights when—and if—she stops to think
of the lost opportunity to teach care of property and
respect for the belongings of others; particularly
when she contemplates the circumstance she has
created for the development of personal habits of
great untidiness and carelessness!)

Children are notoriously loath to remove outer
wraps. Maybe it’s the inertia of the human body—H
or the difficulty they have in getting back into
them, if they are winter garments. Directors know
that their suggestions to remove hats, coats and
so on are often met with protests: “I can’t—I’ll
lose it!” “I’ll forget it.” “I’ve got too many books
(or bundles).” f

With a cloakroom available, none of these pro—
tests will stand up. The garments won’t be lost!
The books can be checked, too, and if the cloak—
room occupies a conspicuous spot somewhere near
the entrance, the chances are that no one will for—
get to claim his possessions on his way out.

In some situations where the group is small, the
director accepts no responsibility—simply sets out
a long pole, hangs some coat hangers upon it and
encourages everyone to use them. In other places
where crowds are large, a more complex, but work—
able, system may be used. Hooks in the cloakroom
are numbered, as well as the space above them for
hats and packages. Each person is given a num—
ber when he checks his things and must present
this number in order to claim them. Needless to
say, an attendant must always be on duty in such
a situation.

Almost every place makes some arrangement for
caring for the wraps of its guests. You do in your
home. Schools do; restaurants do; skating rinks,
dance halls and gymnasiums do. So should com—
munity centers!

Won’t you write and tell us how you manage it?

Pennsylvania———Instead of using many red lan—
terns, which have to be put out and taken in each
day, barricades are painted with tiuorescent paint,
making separate lights unnecessary.

Movable Standard, Newport, Kentucky—
Placed pipe of right size and length vertically in
center of an old pop bottle case. Filled case with
cement. Pontiac, Michigan, used a similar scheme,
with a rubber tire as the base.

Carnival of Song, Milwaukee, Wisconsin—
The city of Milwaukee conducts its well—known
“Music Under the Stars,” where outstanding pro-
fessional artists appear in concerts. Somewhat
along the same lines, the “Carnival of Song” has
been developed under the Milwaukee County Rec—
reation Department. The department secures
names of all outstanding music students in the
area. Through a screening process, the best musi-
cians are selected and many of these are presented
in special outdoor programs in the “Carnival of
Song” series, which includes dancing and related
arts as well as music. This series gives young
artists opportunities to appear, and provides much
fine cultural recreation for large audiences. No

“Without a Song”

Beulah Barnum

LINE FROM AN old popular song, “Without a
A song, the world would be all wrong,” ex-
presses very well how great is the need for music
in pe0ple’s lives. The singing and playing of good
music is a rich emotional experience. No other
activity has the power of music in the expressing
of feelings and in making for group spirit. There
is a place for it in community recreation!

One of the great advantages of singing is that it
requires no special planning or equipment. The
major essentials are time and the right spirit.

One of the simplest forms of music is group
singing, informal, and just for the fun of it. Sing—
ing around a piano or before a blazing fireplace;
joining in on fun songs at the table, at parties and
assemblies, on bus rides and hikes or around the
campfire; singing quiet melodies before “lights
out”—these are just a few of the times for informal

group singing. Too many people do not sing be-
' cause, in their opinion, they do not sing well.
How impoverished the race would be if mothers
had not sung their lullabies, or men and women
their folk songs because they did not have trained
voices. So everyone should learn the tune, sing it
pleasantly, simply and naturally, but with spirit,
and then interest in music cannot help but “catch
on.”

In some cases, trained leadership is necessary;
although one who understands how to get people
to sing correctly, and yet retain fun and fellow—
ship, is a real asset. The group wants to sing in-
stead of being educated or entertained by the lead-
er. Community singing that is well-planned over

perintenderzt of recreation for Jachron, Michigan.

a period should develop into a community chorus.
Song fests, in which various groups partici-
pate, may be handled in the following ways:

1. Select three songs before the fest. Have each group
sing these songs and have judges decide upon the winner.

2. Allow each group the choice of presenting three
songs of their own selection and judge them on this se-
lection as well as on performance.

3. Combine the above methods.

As a feature of the song fest, all groups may sing a few
selections together.

Community choirs and glee clubs may be formed
for those who want to sing regularly. Bands and
orchestras have a place in the music program—
when finances warrant. Rhythm bands are popu-
lar with smaller children, and the new melody
bands, which are between the rhythm and regular
bands, are found in many communities. Children
in melody bands play miniature instruments hav-
ing true tone quality, and they may form pre-band
groups or combine with other band or orchestra
groups.

Kitchen bands are fun for musical stunts and
are concocted entirely from materials at hand.
Satisfactory homemade instruments can furnish
really enjoyable music, and the activity provides
a fine creative experience, both in making some-
thing with the hands and in making music with
the finished instruments. Shepherd pipes and
drums are among the easiest to make.

Music appreciation can be fostered through 1is--
tening to music, participating in music memory
contests and making scrapbooks. The legends upon
which some of the musical masterpieces are based,
the stories behind holiday and folk songs and the
lives of composers make fascinating telling, and
are of infinite value in teaching the appreciation

395

of music. (Storytelling groups take note—Ed.)
Some high quality musical programs on the radio
can also provide an opportunity for deveIOping
this appreciation.

The recreation department may be helpful by:
(I) conducting recreation music activities for chil-
dren; supplementing music instruction in the
schools and integrating it with life outside of the
school; (2) organizing and furnishing leadership
for groups of young people and adults, thus mak-
ing it possible for them to participate in various
forms of music activity; (3) affording opportu-
nities for pe0p1e to listen to and enjoy music pro-
vided by others; (4) cooperating with other com-
munity agencies in organizing and conducting com-
munity-wide activities, such as festivals and carol-

ing projects, and coordinating or bringing exist-
ing music groups together; (5) serving individuals
and community groups, through training institutes,
certain kinds of music instruction, and providing
music leaders; (6) providing community music
groups with auditoriums, concert halls and club-
rooms to be used for concerts, rehearsals, meet-
ings and other activities (if the department has
these facilities available).

In brief, the recreation department should be
helping peOple to find opportunities to make and
enjoy good music. It should be cooperating with
all agencies working toward this end and promot-
ing music activities on all fronts, often coordina-
ting music with other activities in its program.

New Education-Recreation Division

The Education-Recreation Council and the
Youth Division of the National Social Welfare

Assembly have been consolidated to form the
Education-Recreation Division of the assembly.

All present national agencies are eligible, and
the division will consist of one lay and one pro-
fessional staff member from each of the member
agencies. Also, a citizens’ group at large, not to
exceed one-third of the agencies’ representatives,
will help to make up this new division. This ac-
tion is a result of a study conducted by a joint
committee of the Youth Division and the Educa-
tion-Recreation Council. Its recommendations
were accepted by the executive committee of the
assembly, and immediate action was taken. The
oliicers of the new division are expected to take
over some time during january, 1951.

Play Space in New Neighborhoods

The Newark News, Newark, New Jersey, and
the National Recreation Association cooperated in
presenting a two-session forum on November six-

teenth in the News’ auditorium—on “Play Space
in New Neighborhoods.”

The present nationwide interest in housing is
unprecedented. Present building practice offers a
h0pe that open lawn areas will be provided in new
housing projects. Yet there has been slim evi-
dence, to date, that the new neighborhoods being
created are to have adequate open space suitable
for, and permanently dedicated to, permanent use.

HOBBIES

 

AN ENTOMOLOGIST—agm Sweaty 7¢em

OR MORE THAN seventy years I have been an
F ardent entomologist, and I am convinced that
an insight into the world of the butterfly and the
moth may be an in5piration and a relaxation of in-
iinite value for the tired student or the harassed
merchant. Without it life would be narrower and
harder, missing that touch with nature which is
the saving line of escape from the overwhelming
secularism of our age. It became for me a life-
long passion.

My initiation into the ranks of entomologists
occurred in my early teens. It was in the city of
Bristol, where a score or more of grammar school
boys were always talking about the latest addi—
tions to their “collections.” Very soon I joined
them in scouring the Clifton Downs and climbing
the steep sides of the gulley by the Avon in search
of the swift-winged Greylings, Heaths and Skip-
pers, net in hand and eyes open for every butterfly
new to our limited list. It was not long before I
became familiar with the entire sixty-seven species
of English butteriiies through my Coleman’s “But-

terHies,” with rare visits ‘to the store of Mr. Mann,
the naturalist.

But I suppose it was our removal to Canterbury
,that really made me an enthusiast, with the long
rambles through the thick oak woods to Whitstable
and trips to the chalk cliffs of Dover. Another
change, and the life at a large boys’ college in
Southampton gave the opportunity to range the
glades of the New Forest at Brokenhurst, finding
the White Admiral and the Wood White. Fortu-
nately our headmaster, Colonel Lees, was a patron
of nature study who did much to stimulate my
zeal for my hobby when he presented a prize for
my poor little story of butterfly life as the first es—
say of a fourth form boy to appear in the college
magazine. With his kindly encouragement, we
would use our boat—pass to the Isle of Wight and
roam the lanes, fmding many a treasured specimen.
Even more instructive was the insight which our
‘old schoolmaster gave us into plant life, where
eggs were laid and caterpillars reared with the

DECEMBER 1950

mysterious instinct which led each species to select

the one and only herb upon which its grub would
feed.

What a thrill of excitement was added to later
days during many a trip to the European conti-
nent! To find Daplidicae on the Venetian Lido,
before it was subjected to the desecration of tour-
ism; to tramp over the Simplon Pass in Switzer-
land and net the swift-winged Apollo; and to go to
the heights of the Pyrenees to capture rare species
which haunt the majestic Cirque de Gavarnie!
Never traveling without net, bottle and box, I
have wandered afar, finding an escape from ardu-
ous academic studies on the heath by day, or by
“sugaring” for the moth in the warmth of sum-
mer nights.

Somehow, devotion to entomology seems to in-
volve one in a kind of “wanderlust.” Thus I have
been intrigued by the gaudy butterliies of North
Carolina, by those of the Pacific Coast and of the
Rockies. Often I have found additional fascination
in perusing Kirby’s masterpiece on butterflies and
moths, or in pondering over specimens brought
back from distant Singapore by a British colonel
who would hire Chinese coolies to net specimens
new to science from the top of forest trees.

Looking back after all these years, with the
haunting memories of these hours of relaxation, a
great pity lays hold of me for the city boy and the
oHice slave who merely turn a listening ear to the
loud call of the radio; who devote their spare hours
to the fascination of Hollywood. To them the but-
terfly is merely a “bug” for the reckless youngster
to fling his cap at or to capture that he may torture
it by plucking out its wings. Yet, thousands in
our public schools might be taught or initiated into
some branch of nature study which would be an
inspiration for them during the years of respon-
sibility which lie ahead.

At the end of the years, I find myself, even in
cold Quebec, still enjoying my life-long interest,
comforted by memories of beautiful forest, glen
and mountainside.

A Santa Claus Parade

A small Canadian town of four thousand—Arn-
prior—has staged a parade featuring Santa for the
last three years—so why can’t you? It is sponsored
by the local Lions Club, publicized by the local
newspaper, The Arnprior Chronicle, and whole-
heartedly endorsed by the citizens. The Lions Club
arranges for a citizens’ band to lead the parade;
and committees get together with industries and
merchants regarding Hoats. Prizes are offered for
the best ones. Practical results can be seen later,
in the stores. '

If your community plans such a parade in the
future, the following advice is offered by the Lions
committee: I. As a great deal of thought and
work go into the planning and decoration of these
floats, they should be kept on the streets as long
as possible. 2. Routing of the parade should be so
arranged that the kiddies, eager as they are, will
not have to stand out in the cold for too long a
time.

From Santa’s Headquarters

In Decatur, Illinois, last year, the recreation
department sent one of the following letters to
each child who had written to Santa at the Christ-
mas Village in Central Park. Over one thousand
letters had been received.

SANTA CLAUS HEADQUARTERS
"‘Dear

“Thank you for writing me such a nice letter,
and ‘Mother Goose’. liked it, too.

“We hope that you will come visit us soon so
that we can talk more about what you want for
Christmas.

“Lots of fun and excitement at my ‘house’ this
year and I’ll be looking for you.

Objectives of Santa Claus School

The Recreation and Promotion Service, Incor-
porated, of Wilmington, Delaware, lists as the
objectives of its Santa Claus School:

I. To teach people desiring to be Santa Clauses
the proper techniques.

2. To develop more natural and realistic Santas.

DECEMBER 1950

 

3. To give people background information con-
cerning the history of Christmas.

4. To provide an opportunity for those who
have played Santa Claus to exchange and discuss
ideas on how to be better Santa Clauses.

The school offers information and training on
the background of Santa—the legend; his appear-
ance; costume—and how it should be worn; make-
up; necessary “props” for the part; plans for
Santa’s visit; and suggestions for community Santa
Claus projects. A leaflet is published, describing
the course in further detail. Write to George Sar-
gisson, Recreation and Promotion Service, 101
\Vest Fourteenth Street, Wilmington, Delaware.

This Matter of Awards

The Milwaukee Recreation Department is mak-
ing an effort to get away from the practice of
giving “awards.” At the end of a season of team
play, it, instead, presents each member with an
eight-by-ten photograph of the team. To those
local organizations and businesses which want to
present awards, in their own name, the department
says: “If you have money that you want to spend
on youngsters, give them a feed—something that
everyone can enjoy.”

Floor Protection

To protect the hardwood floor in the St. Joseph,
Missouri, auditorium for its primary use—basket-
ball games—the manager has it covered with four-
by-twelve-foot panels of Masonite quarter-inch
tempered hardboard whenever there are such
special events as boxing, wrestling and trade ex-
positions. The dense, exceptionally tough panels
are wear and water-resistant. W'hen the Hoor is
needed for a basketball game, the hardboards are
simply picked up and moved into storage.

.Junior Choirs

Published material which may be helpful to any-
one contemplating the organization of a junior
choir (look these up in your library) include:

Midland, Michigan, after operating a toboggan '
slide built according to the suggestions in George
Butler’s Recreation Areas—Their Design and
Equipment, modified its slide with highly satisfac-
tory results. Built of two-by-eight-inch planks for
two-thirds the length of the run, and of two-by-six-

dress: Educational Music Bureau, 30 East Adams
Street, Chicago 3, Illinois.

City Ski Slope

Situated entirely within city limits, \Natertown,
New York’s new ski slope and ski tow—run by
electric motor—are easily accessible to community
residents. They are operated by the recreation
department, under the leadership of Superinten-
dent John Patterson, as one of the highlights of
the winter recreation program. 0

The ski facility is situated on the northeasterly
slope of Thompson Park, which has about 250
acres of land. The ski run is about 1,000 feet in
length. Its tow is approximately 600 feet long,
serving the steepest portion which is 'on a twenty-
Five per cent grade over the 600-foot distance.

A metal building, located at the crest of the
hill, houses the tow apparatus and furnishes warm-
ing facilities for those who enjoy the sport.

inch planks for the other third, the slide is like a
railroad track with vertical sides. The planks are
placed nineteen inches apart and re-enforced every
eight feet at the joints, with a four—by-four-inch
board, three feet long, embedded in the ground.
The full width of the planks is therefore available
for the sides of the slide.

Midland also did some experimenting with its
starting racks. The first year, a tilting rack was
used, but because of too many possibilities for
injuries and the need for constant repair, two
eight-foot sections of second-hand steel conveyors
were substituted for each tilting rack. These are
proving ideal——particularly since only a slight push
or pull by one of the riders is required to start the
toboggan.

An area has been cleared next to the return

toboggan slide for a ski hill, and future plans call
for further improvement of this area as well as
the addition of a ski tow.

N THE expansion of National Recreation Asso—
I ciation field services and the realigning of staff
responsibilities in the various districts, one of the
able people recently to move on to the list of dis—
trict representatives is Harold W. Lathrop—well-
known for his field work for the association at the
state level. His new appointment as “DR” for Colo-
rado, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming
came as a pleasant surprise to these states.

Harold is an informal, friendly soul, with a
breezy western manner. In talking with him, it
seems natural to be calling him Harold within a
matter of minutes. If you don’t, he’ll suggest it.
Also one realizes at once that here is an alert per-
son not only devoted to his job, but interested in
many things. He has a way of unexpectedly com-
ing out with information on amazing subjects.

His'easy and comfortable way with people and
success with state work are explained by his feel-
ing that folks are just folks, be they governors,
state recreation chairmen or janitors. On this

402

basis he enjoys everyone; and this continues to be
one of his strengths in his present job. As a
matter of fact, he enjoys his job hugely; and he
is the sort of person who gets things done.

From his earliest years, he has been interested
in building and, as a boy, wanted to be a civil en— '
gineer. As he grew up in Minneapolis, he watched
the building of the city park system. When the

first \Vorld War broke out, although he hadn’t
finished school, he joined the navyT—thus inter-

immediately at Dunwoody Institute for the study
of engineering. After his course was completed in
1924, he immediately obtained employment with
the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners.

For seven years thereafter, Harold worked and
studied, taking many supplementary engineering
courses as he needed them. Upon passing an ex-
amination for registered professional civil engi-
neers, he became assistant engineer for the park
department. Says he: “From 1927 to 1934 I was
planning parks and playgrounds for Minneapolis
under the tutorship of Theodore Wirth. This was
excellent training and I wouldn’t exchange it for a
doctorate from any college.” (For a story on
Theodore Wirth, see RECREATION, March 1949,
page 561.——Ed.)

In 1934 he was drafted by the governor to serve
as the first director of Minnesota state parks and
to write the legislation which would set up a sepa-
rate state agency to develop and administer them

and make the job permanent. He held that position
until September 1046, when he resigned to join the
staff of the National Recreation Association.

Harold Lathrop takes it as inevitable that
through the years of his park service there should
occur a gradual broadening of his interests and
concerns to include the recreation field. “Through
continuous study of park needs in Minneapolis,
and of needs in state government,” he explains, “I
developed a keener appreciation of how broad this
thing is and of how many agencies lit into the
picture. In state work I obtained a better insight

into what opportunities exist in state government
to develop a better use of leisure time.”

\Vhile he was president of the National Confer-
ence on State Parks from 1942 to 1946, he had
further Opportunity for the study of state park pro-
grams and the possibilities which they afford for
meeting the recreation needs of pe0ple. This op-
portunity, however, will continue indefinitely, for
he has become a life director of the conference.
And, during those years, his background of ex-

perience was shaping up well for his eventual
work for the NRA.

When he came to the association, he brought
with him a knowledge of state governments; was
well-versed in the over-all programs of all depart-
ments in the state of Minnesota; and was secure
in the feeling that he had something to contribute
to recreation. Accustomed to talking with direc-
tors of various departments, he could now put him-
self in the place of these administrators and ap-
preciate what problems they had to meet in order
to sell a recreation program to citizens. “I’ve
always enjoyed talking over people’s park and

recreation problems,” says he. This experlence, of

course, will also be invaluable to him in his new
job.

have such facilities of their own—a practice, by
the way, which continues to be followed. It was

then that he began to understand the elements
involved in a broad program.

The NRA state job was a challenge to show to
others the potentialities of state services in the field
of recreation. As he watched the growth of recre-
ation in the eighteen western states, where he rep-
resented the association, and saw how they fitted
into the whole recreation pattern either nationally

404

or individually, he found seeing the results of his ,
own work gratifying, indeed.

His state work involved the ferreting out of
present activities of state departments and the
analyzing of possibilities for an over-all program.
He pointed up where more might be done with
their present resources, for some expansion, and
with conservation, state parks, forests, education
and highway departments, library commissions,
natural history and historical museums or societies,
state publicity bureaus, state planning boards or
allied commissions. As a “DR” he will continue_

this work, and his experience will still be available
for special state projects.

Harold makes his home in Wheat Ridge, Colo-
rado, a suburb of Denver, which he says is a good
central location for his headquarters. He has a
grown son and daughter in Minnesota and is a
proud grandfather; but he also has acquired a new
family through a second marriage—three girls,
ages twenty, nineteen, and seventeen respectively,
and a nine-year-old boy. He is very proud of them.
His wife, Bea, is interested in his work, travels
with him whenever she can, and acts as his secre-
tary. Their home, or “ranch” as they call it, buzzes
with activity. Being an engineer, his own leisure-
time activities include doing things with his hands
—crafts, woodwork, making furniture for the
house or working around the ranch. He gets great
entertainment from taking time out to aid Bea with
her Cub Scouts “den,” but his “big challenge”
comes from helping-his nine-year-old son to de-

ve10p interests of his own.

However, Harold Lathrop thinks of his job as

part of his own recreation, and says gleefully: “I

|: YOU WILL remember Mrs. Watson, head of the

children’s department of the Denver Public
Library, for her Radio Plays for Children, pub-
lished in 1947 (see November 1947 issue of REC-
REATION). For some years she conducted a story-
telling program over the radio. These stories were
published under the title Once Upon a Time, the
collection proving one of the most popular of the
\Vilson Company’s series of radio publications.

Storytellers, parents, librarians will now welcome
Tales for Telling, which includes seven stories
taken from old volumes of S t. Nicholas. Among
them are such “finds” as Stahl’s humorous fairy
tale “The Kingdom of the Greedy,” and Boyesen’s
“The Sun's Sisters.” In addition to these and a
few modern stories, there are unhackneyed selec-
tions from old favorites—thirty-three stories in
all. These are grouped according to subject and
type—Christmas, Easter, fairy and folk tales, farm,
Halloween, humor, and so on. The author has timed
and adapted all selections so that they will be ap*
propriate for broadcasting.

For the convenience of broadcasters, all but a
few are based upon material no longer in copy-
right, thus eliminating the need for “double per-
missions.” All stories in the volume may be used
on non-commercial broadcasts without payment of
royalty.

From books and magazines, Miss Fenner has
gathered together some of the best of recent Indian
stories, resulting in a collection glowing with color
and excitement and showing a great sympathy for
our native Americans who were here long before
the white man ever came. Some of the titles are:
“Wilderness Road,” Jim Kjelgaard ; “Buffalo
and Injuns,” Carol Ryrie Brink; “Drums in the
Fog,” Rupert Sargent Holland; “Becky’s Christ-
mas Turkey,” Constance Lindsay Skinner; “The

Following Indian Trails

Pamphlet prepared by the Program Department of
the Camp Fire Girls, Incorporated, New York.

$.25.

THIS MIMEOGRAPHED leadership pamphlet, pre-

pared by the Program Department of the
Camp Fire Girls, gives a brief historical presenta-
tion of the part American Indians have played in
the history of our country and information about
legislation affecting the Indians today; a crafts
section, basing selection of activities upon an un-
derstanding of the Indian; and a section which is
a further eXploration of ways in which youngsters
can become acquainted with the cultural contribu-
tion of the Indians to the United States. Bibli-
ographies are included in each section.

Forced Landing

Prepared by Frankie Culpepper Goerges and
Frances Loomis \Vallace for the Program De-
partment of the Camp Fire Girls, Incorporated,

New York.
HERE IS A PAMPHLET giving a novel, modern
Robinson Crusoe suggestion for stimulating
greater interest in a knowledge of. the out-of-doors
and in outdoor craft. Combining nature lore and

407

camp crafts, the idea centers around an imaginary
plane trip which is to result in a forced landing
and consequent survival until rescue. The prepara-
tions necessary for such an emergency include
some personal equipment and a knowledge of how
to recognize, and make use of, natural surround-
ings. Planned originally as a project for the Camp
Fire resident summer camp, Forced Landing has
been used successfully in day camp and summer-
in-town programs too. This offers a great oppor-
tunity to use the imagination and have fun!

Leadership of Teen-Age Groups

Dorothy M. Roberts.
York. $3.00.

IN HER PREFACE, Mrs. Roberts says: “Teen-agers

are people, not problems. They have problems
during the process of growing up. Often they can-
not solve these problems alone. They need help
and will accept it from understanding adults.”
She goes on to share, with other adults, ideas for
organization, leadership and program planning

that have proved acceptable to, and effective with,
teen-age groups.

Association Press, New

Mrs. Roberts, herself, has been active in volun-
teer work, as advisor to clubs for boys and girls
for over twenty years, and here—without technical
language—she helps parents and leaders to see the
importance of maintaining a balance between adult
authority and youthful freedom. Good adult lead-
ership makes the difference between happy, learn-

ing groups and unhappy, defiant, passive or ag-
gressive groups and individuals.

Leathercraft Techniques and Designs

John W. Dean. McKnight and McKnight Pub-
hshing Company, Bloomington, Illinois. $5.00.
HIS PARTICULARLY beautiful book, filled with
fascinating illustrations and prepared by a
widely-known teacher, author and designer, will
be a valuable addition to the library of every ex-
perienced or would-be leather craftsman. Mr.
Dean says in his preface: “The purpose of this
book is not to review the many divisions of leath-
ercraft which have been well-covered by other
writers but, rather, to add some practical ideas,
suggestions and facts to the general fund of infor-

mation already published on this fascinating hobby
and avocation.”

The book is filled with helpful hints on design
and technique—~—all instructions being presented

clearly and step-by-step. Each procedure has been
thoroughly tested by the author and found practi-

408

cal. The information on coloring and dying leather If

covers the use of acids, oils, water colors and many
other special pigments. One full section is given
over to tools and equipment; another to processes;
and the largest of all to specific projects. A book
of fifty full-size plates has also been published as
a companion to this volume.

Skeet and Trapshooting

Dick Shaughnessy with Tap Goodenough. A. S.
Barnes and Company, New York. $3.00.

WRITTEN by a champion skeet shooter, this is a
complete “how-to—do-it” manual. Whether
you shoot for points or game, are a beginner or
expert, you are bound to find valuable tips in this
comprehensive treatment of the subject, with its
many illustrative diagrams and photographs show-
ing form and stance. The official rules for this
sport are included. An appendix also offers a
skeet and trapshooting directory.

Field Book of Nature Activities

William Hillcourt. G. P. Putnam’s Sons, New
York. $3.95.

HIS HANDY-SIZED nature guide, planned for

easy reference, and another addition to Put-
nam’s Field Books, offers a collection of ideas for
every conceivable nature hobby. It includes in-
structions for watching wildlife in the fields and
for bringing nature into the home, camp, garden
or classroom ; the making of nature collections, the
taking of nature photographs; the making of bottle
gardens; and hundreds of suggestions for other
specific projects—things to do and make. This is
excellent for the tool kit of the recreation leader,
camp counselor or teacher.
