Building with blocks; building with men—these two
processes seem completely apart. Yet, they both have
one important element in common—recreation.

This youngster is absorbed in his chosen activity
of constructing a house, a castle—or whatever his
imagination dictates. This is his recreation of the
moment and he enjoys it. At the same time, unknown
and unimportant to him now, he is learning to build
a foundation of good citizenship. For each play ac-
tivity opens its own door to other worlds, revealing
his role as member of the family, neighbor of the

community, citizen of the world. Photo courtesy “All

ODAY, MANY PERSONS are deeply
concerned with the future of de-
ocracy and personal freedom. We ad-
it the need for preparedness. We
now that the nation must be preserved
preserved that we may have this
ame freedom. But the ideal of democ-
acy needs to be much clearer and
ore vivid in the minds of this and

e next generation. The ideal of the

reedom and rights of the individual

ust be kept alive and must have a

ital meaning to us all. With the pos-

ibility of being, over a period of years,

: garrison state (country), we know

00 that we will have some of the ear-

arks, at least, of a military state——

even though ours is a democratic army
hich acts to preserve democracy and

s indeed our salvation and protection.

ut we need even so to hold close our

'deas of a democratic existence.

The vagueness and variety of the
onception of what democracy is handi-
Bap us in the pursuit of our ideals. To
ome democracy means (beside Coca-
01a and movies) freedom from all re-
ponsibility—personal, civic or na-
ional. To others democracy means a
igh degree of individual responsibility
or the betterment of city, state and
ation, as well as for self-development.
n all cases it is the individual, not the
ass, who is the basic core of democ-
racy; and the coordinated efforts,
energy and responsibility of individuals
I ake possible group action for the
r aintenance and betterment of city,

tate and national affairs. This action

'is not forced however; it is the will of
.the majority of the representatives of
the people.

I We have ceased to assume that
people know automatically what democ-
racy is and why they, as individuals,
are important in the democratic scheme

“FEBRUARY 1 95 1

and

Democracy

of things. We know that the minds of
many are distracted with concrete and
fascinating things from Toni waves to
baseball. We know that even if they
favor democracy in theory, they must
feel the reality of this theory through
practice. They must, through practice
in, and understanding of, democratic
behavior, grow up with a strong feeling
for individual freedom and group re-
sponsibility. They need practice and
action involving work and play with,
and for, others.

There is in the field of recreation a
tremendous opportunity for wise and
skillful leadership in just such prac-
tices. The recreation situation lends it-
self readily to these further goals. Rec-
reation leaders serve groups of persons
who may range from the very young
to the very old, but who have some
mutual interest. Members of a group
may wish to learn to paint, weave or,
if older, to give a play, sing in a chorus
or form a club, and so forth. They will
do all this as members of a group. A
good leader helps in the organization
of the group for whatever they may
wish to do, but he or she is also able
to help this group feel that it is their
activity and to see that these persons
have some responsibility as well as en-
joyment out of the affair.

This need for democratic practices
is recognized and accepted, but it is
more easily accepted in theory than in
practice. In the first place, the leader
needs tact, instinctive feeling for people,
sympathy, ideas and an inner strength
that he or she may be able both to give
away and yet retain authority in the
handling of groups. In the second
place, we need the principles of democ-
racy put into simple lay language. We
need a “Ten Commandments” of de-
mocracy for all to learn, study and prac-

D-orollny S. Ainsworth

tice. The ideas of democracy should be
firmly fixed in the minds and hearts of
the young if it is to survive. It is in-
deed necessary to know, as well as prac-
tice, the ideas embraced by the word
democracy.

In the third place, we need young
democratic leaders who are articulate
as well as the skillful teachers or lead-
ers of drama, art, music, games and so
forth. So it goes back to the person
and to his or her skill, knowledge, per-
sonality, and above and beyond all this,
his or her belief in democracy. Will
he believe it worth his while, his time
and energy, to work for democracy? If
yes, then these are the leaders we need.
The recreation field is indeed a “gold
mine” for the understanding of, and
practice in, the democratic pattern of
life if the leaders can be experts in
democratic leadership as well as experts
in their own field.

This is a challenge and an opportu-
nity for leaders today. We believe that
they are aware of this and of the need,
as well, to further the training of our
children and youth in democratic the-
ories and practices. Such leadership
will give recreation a place and stand-
ing of great importance throughout our
nation. For, in recreation, we are not
dealing simply with busy work or un-
important play to keep the young out
of mischief. We are giving much, much
more and seeking, under wise leader-
ship, to build responsible, enthusiastic
citizens. This is the goal and the need
in our world of today.

Robert Garrett
Retires

 

Judge Coleman presents a book to Mr, Gar-
rett “in which are inscribed the affection
and gratitude of many of his associates. . .”

AST JUNE TENTH, the Mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, accepted the resignation of Robert Garrett as chair-

man of the board of the Department of Recreation and Parks. On November thirtieth, several hundred

fellow citizens tendered him a testimonial dinner to express their appreciation for his many contributions
to the community over a period of more than fifty years.

The principal speaker, Phillip B. Perlman, Solicitor General of the United States, used these words
of John Greenleaf Whittier to describe Mr. Garrett:

“Formed on the good old plan,
A true and brave and honest downright man! . . .

Loathing pretense, he did with cheerful will
What others talked of while their hands were still.”

Financier, public official and civic leader, one of Robert Garrett’s principal interests has been the
field of public recreation. He was one of the organizers in 1907 of the Baltimore Public Athletic League,
which later merged with the Children’s Playground Association to form the Playground Athletic League.
He also served as chairman of the Board of the Department of Public Recreation and, until this past year,
as president of the Baltimore Board of Recreation and Parks. In December 1949, he was honored by local
radio station WBAL for achievement in American sports.

In addition, Mr. Garrett has been, and continues to be, a member of the Board of Directors of the
National Recreation Association since 1910, serving as its chairman from 1941 until May 1950.

Typical of the 'man is the fact that all his civic activities have been performed without thought of
personal aggrandizement, but in response to his own conscience and sense of duty to his fellow man. Seek-

ing ever to further the recreation movement in America, he has been an active sponsor of the NRA since
1922.

In a letter to Mr. Garrett, Joseph Prendergast, executive director of the association, wrote:

“It gives me great pleasure and satisfaction to record here the deep feeling of appreciation the
National Recreation Association holds for you .

“The Board of the National Recreation Association is justly proud of your forty years of splendid,
unselfish service as one of its members and of the nine years within that period during which you served
as chairman of the Board. Times without number, your broad experience and personal knowledge in the

Hats off to the author who took off
he lid from the frenzied “western”
quare dance picture! His article must

ave made faces red and stirred up a
ot of guilty consciences.

During the days of WPA recreation,
enver and Colorado became nationally
ecognized for reviving the old “west-
rn” square and round dances-A prac-
ical program was maintained; classes

eachers were primarily interested in

ected, bringing cheers of approval
rom the dancers. These tricky mix-up
alls were the exception rather than

ancing squares or the smooth Varso-
ienne, Schottische and Rye Waltz.

ey changed partners freely; there
ere few cliques.

With the exit of WPA recreation,
acquare dancing became practically ex-
Itinct in Denver. Only a few private and
quasi-public groups survived. Most call-
grs found that they were unable to hold
their dance clubs together without the
publicity and the constant feeding of

new people into their groups which re-
sults from a large scale public program.

In 1944, the newly-organized Den-
ver Municipal Recreation Department
picked up the threads where they had
been dropped by WPA, employing
some of the same skilled leadership.
Since then, instruction classes have
been scheduled during winter months
in school gyms and recreation centers
throughout the city. A basic teaching
program has been offered. Filled to
overflowing, these classes have served
as a feeder to the many private and
quasi-public clubs and groups which
have appeared over the area. The city
recreation department has run no big-
time dances during the winters for the
so-cal-led square dance graduate. No
attempt has been made to teach the
extreme steps and figures.

The department has buffeted the con-
stant stream of new dance inventions
obviously dreamed up by callers either
in their mad dash to “keep ahead of
the other guys” or for the increasingly
apparent incentive of financial gain.
Prima donna callers, with their selfish
ambitions, have caused confusion for
the public which is seeking recreation.
Not satisfied with their opportunities
for portrayal of individual style in call-
ing, they have found it desirable even
to change the dance pattern itself. To
satisfy their greed, many callers have

totally crowded the musical accompani-
ment into the background so that only
the accents can be heard. These callers
have not wanted to share credit with
co-workers, but to run the show!

The recreation department organized
and sponsors the Denver Square Dance
Callers Association to assist in such
matters as standardization of dance
figures and dress, training of new call-
ers, encouragement of dignity and other
undertakings for the development of
square dancing as recreation.

Outdoor dancing “under the stars”
has been conducted at Denver’s Civic
Center, the Park of the Red Rocks and
at other parks during the summer sea-
son. With facilities filled to capacity, a
moderate, well-balanced program has
been offered to meet the ability of Mr.
and Mrs. Average Dancer.

The leadership behind Denver’s rec-
reation program has been alarmed at
the trend toward faster exhibition-
type square dancing. It knows that it
can satisfy and appeal only to that
minority of dancers who can master it.
It knows that after the elimination of
all of those who cannot keep up with the
pace physically, all of those who cannot
master the skills because of mental or
rhythmic limitations, all of those who
just plain “get disgusted with all the
new stuff,” all of those who drop out
because of a distaste for the ever-in-
creasing cliques, and for other reasons,
the good old “western” square and
round dancing will be among the dead!

Afterwards, what other activity can
be substituted that will provide such
healthy, friendly fun for so many thou-
sands of people? Let us who have had
our hands on the square dancing pulse
for so many years grab the wheel, steer
out of this rut and get back into the
middle of the road before the rut be-

comes a grave. It’s later than you think.

Sirs:

This well-written article certainly
points out dangers and hazards to
avoid if possible. I am quite sure that

all of the evils indicated will appear in
some form in all sections of the country.

Nevertheless. I feel that there are

elements of the superficial in the view-
point of anyone who condemns a whole

471

movement or a phase of a movement
because snobs and exhibitionists ap-
pear here and there. After all, even
anything as healthful as the square
dance movement cannot change char-
acter overnight. Unfortunately, some-
times and in some places, the snob and
the exhibitionist predominate. Most
times, however, such peOple become so
thoroughly mixed with the “real peo-
ple” type of dancer that the superiority
complex rubs off.

The author deplores some of the com-
plicated figures and other “ginger-
bread” which he says characterize this
dancing. No one will argue that here
and there too much of the “star, grab,
grab, grab, star,” to quote Pappy Shaw,
type of thing does not take place, but
there is nothing to be said for dancing
“down the center and cut off six” for-
ever either. One of the finest features
of square dancing is the fact that while
it can be made simple enough that the
beginner can learn enough about it to
have fun in a few minutes, there con-
tinues to be a challenge for the “ad-
dict” in learning dances which call for
an increased degree of skill. I do not
believe the quarrel lies in the fact that
there are complicated dances but,
rather, in the fact that all too often
dancers are shoved into something of
a complicated nature without having
had the basic preparation. The old
things and the siInple things must be
learned first; but it is my contention
that there must be some of both. If
everything is simple or if everything is
complicated, we have a diet which soon
palls. Even the highly-skilled dancers
enjoy the simple dances now and then,
and the beginning dancer certainly
should look.forward to the time when
he can do some of the more compli-
cated routines whether for exhibition
or personal pleasure. Without some
place to go, interest wanes. One of
the reasons that this type of dancing
died out before was the constant repe-
tition of the same old thing over and
over and over. I certainly make no case
for the epidemic of “new danceitis”
that is sweeping some parts of the coun-
try—for many of the new dances are
trash and not worth the effort—but
never to change anything is unthink-
able, too.

The writer also deplores the urban-
ized dance and indicates a longing for
the return of the truly rural type. I
happen to be working in a section of
the country where, until the recent re-
vival, the old rural “eastern” dance pre-

472

dominated and where I have some op-
portunity to observe the old as well as
to help engineer the change to the new.
Let me express a hearty preference for
the urbanized form, even if this some-
times results in a “stylized routine . . .
with whirls and acrobatics of exhibi-
tionists,” as compared to the rough
stuff of the old barnyard style. Far
better a few reasonably smooth whirls,
even if they do violence to the structure
of the dance, than the hopping, stamp-
ing, yanking and throwing each other
about that seem to characterize the
rural dance. The modern caller, even
when he has too much patter and breaks
rhythm a bit here and there, is a far
cry in advance of the old caller who
bellowed nasal commands which no one
except close relatives and people who
had danced to his calling for years
could possibly understand. At least,
modern “western” callers can be un-
derstood and we do not very often have,
in “western” dancing, that frequent de-
velopment of eastern rural areas where
every set has its own caller, with every
group on the floor doing a different
thing and confusion reigning supreme.

The author deplores alike the dress-
ing up of the dancer in the “western”
dance as well as the dressing up of the
dance. In the West we have come to
feel that it is one of the fine things
about this type of dance that the danc-
ers are taking enough pride to dress
the part. Even though, occasionally,
costumes are over-elaborate, they are
certainly more suitable than the suit
and “Sunday best” type of thing to be
found at the usual rural dance.

I cannot help but feel that in spite
of the author’s fears, the future of
“western” square dancing is reasonably
sound and that the general development
is healthy. Nevertheless, the evils to
which the author objects must be pre-
vented from becoming too widespread
if the square dance movementis to con-
tinue to be the great recreational out-
let that it is now.

Sirs:

Many people whom I meet during the
course of calling and teaching groups
will inquire as to whether the so-called
boom in folk and square dancing is
not a fad.

One of the explanations given is that
it is not a fad, but has experienced an

uphill climb for approximately fifteen
years or more and that it is here to stay
and will continue to grow.

The “why” is in an article written in
the English Dance and Song pamphlet,
September 1950, by D. W. Kennedy,
who says, “I must admit the rustic
square of 1938 has grown into a very
versatile and sophisticated model in
1950. The square . . . seems able to
shape itself to all types.”

As a child grows, we know that cer-
tain growing pains are experienced.
Naturally, it is up to the parent to see
that the child does not develop any-
thing serious from these ailments. At
the same time, the wise parent knows
that the child must be given a little
slack so that he will have experiences
where, by doing and making mistakes,
he will learn—and still be guided by
the parent who holds the reins.

Some of the growing pains of “west-
ern” square dancing, which one recrea-
tion leader calls “extremes,” show up
in snobbery, exclusiveness, condescen-
sion and superiority complexes; but
“western” dancing is growing to a
greater stature, is young and capable of
more maturity.

The Hair, the publicity, the clubs, the
glamor, the catchiness of’it all, the dress
and costumes and even the complexities
of dancing are some of the methods
which have wonderfully engulfed thou-
sands of new peOple in a fine and
healthy recreation activity.

It is known that in order to stimulate
interest 'and learning, there also must
be a challenge. Therefore, some of the
extremes, such as trick figures and ex-
hibitions, can also be considered as '-
motivating forces. There are people and I
groups who are interested in doing and '
learning these complexities (so-called)
of dancing, just as there are people
and groups who are only interested in
doing the easy, relaxed type of danc-l
ing. . .

Surely the leaders, the people and the I
communities of other parts of the coun- I
try who do not like a particular form'
or method of dancing do not neces-
sarily have to discard the entire article
but can look at it objectively and usen
parts which can be adapted to their\
own needs. . .

And last, but not least, is there not a -
possibility that we are heading for a
higher standard of dancing?

O CONSOLIDATION of the Associated
Services for the Armed Forces and the
United Service Organization has been
approved by boards of both organiza-
tions at a recent meeting. The new or-
ganization will be called United Serv-

expected to include the old war-time
agencies that originally contributed to
its work. These are the Young Men’s
Christian Association, the National
Catholic Community Service, the Sal-
vation Army, the National Jewish Wel-
fare Board, the National Travelers Aid
Association, the Young Women’s Chris-

The USO was founded on February
4, 1941, but ceased operations on De-

'cember 31, 194-7. Called back into serv-
ice in July 1948 at the request of Presi-
dent Truman, it was again deactivated
on January 31, 1950, because of lack
of funds. At that time its executive
committee recommended that corpo-
rate entity be retained so that it would
be available for immediate service in a
national emergency.

O A DRAFT 0F SUGGESTED PROCEDURES
and criteria has been filed by the Na-
tional Recreation Association with the
National Production Authority for the
approval of exceptions for recreation
projects from the provisions Of Order
M-4 on the basis of their contribution
to the national defense program or
hardship to the communities if they
were not granted exceptions. The asso-
ciation is grateful to the many local
recreation and park leaders who sent
in so many constructive suggestions for
these criteria in response to its “News-
letter of December thirteenth. These
were very helpful in drafting the state-
ment submitted to the National Pro-
duction Authority.

0 MANY RECREATION EXECUTIVES and
staff workers bring their personnel rec-
ords up-tO-date with the National Rec-
reation Association’s Personnel Service
periodically. This practice has proved
to be mutually beneficial to both profes-
sional workers and to the recreation
movement.

Because of the national emergency,
this might be a good time for workers
who have not done so recently to notify
us if they are available for permanent
or temporary emergency assignments.
Because of our cooperative relation-
ships with those responsible for recre-
ation personnel in the armed forces,
it is important that the association
know when recreation workers are leav-
ing for military or war-connected as-
signments.

O ACCORDING TO AN AGREEMENT with
the City Council, the Planning Com-
mission of Charlotte, North Carolina,
refers all plans for subdivisions to the
Parks and Recreation Commission. Al-
though the resolution does not stipu-
late that a subdivider must donate prop-
erty or funds, it does give the Parks

tunity to advise on matters concerning
reservations for public parks and play-
grounds and to be aware of develop-
ments before the final stages of plan-

SQUARE DANCING, TEXAS STYLE

ECENTLY, the eminent musical genius, Sir Thomas

Beecham of Great Britain, voiced the opinion that
Texas could be the center of Western civilization and cul-
ture. The dance, along with music, in all of its myriad forms,
has long been a criterion of culture; but not until recently
has the dance of early America, the “western” square dance,
that grew up without benefit of records, come into its own
as an integral part of American recreation, American his-
tory and American literature.

There are several square dance areas in the United States,
and certainly one of the largest is Texas. Geographically,
it has been designated as the largest state and, very
modestly, all Texans think that what they do and how they
do it constitute the largest, best and very often the only
way for any given activity. Perhaps, because of the very
nature of square dancing, we Texans have not felt this way
about our square dance culture. We have borrowed pro-
fusely from all surrounding states and accepted freely the
infiltration of the Mexican two-step into our once rather
monotonous one-step or walk. Along the Oklahoma border,
the Colorado and Oklahoma whirl is evident, and surely
any “standardization” of true Texas style would need to
include a mention of the Abilene-Sweetwater Dip—an in-
genious invention of two progressive leaders for an exhibi-
tion set in that area several years ago, now used extensively
at westerners’ dances. Yet, the ten thousand or more
square dancers comprising the cosmopolitan Houston area
would exclaim in horror should the Westerner’s Dip or the

bination be considered the “correct” way. For them the
“right” way to square dance is to use a rather slow beat
and a simple, smooth glide step. Just as Texas has bor-
rowed, so also Austin, because of its central geographical
location, has borrowed freely from its larger surrounding
territories; and here we find various combinations of north,
west and south Texas styles of dancing. Some specific
groups use the two-step exclusively; others the fast buzz
step of the North and East; others the simple walk of the
pioneer—and yet, at city-wide dances, the entire floor
moves with a smooth combination of all. '

The organization of square dancing in Austin, Texas, has
followed the general trend of organizations over the entire
state. As central Texas has drawn from its surrounding
territories in its style of dancing, just so, almost simultane-
ously, the Mid-Tex Square Dancers Association and, later,
Austin’s Square Dance Council have benefited by their
sister organizations over the state. Perhaps the oldest rec- :
ords of organized square dancing in Texas—and by that l
we mean a sponsoring group, such as a recreation depart- i
ment, offering through its teaching and dancing staff facili- I
ties for all—are found in Austin and Houston. As far back r.
as 1928 and 1929, these city recreation departments were 
offering square dance lessons; and, in Houston, there was '
an association that helped promote and sponsor city-wide .
dances. Except for the fact that comparatively few enjoyed

the dancing in those years, their enthusiasm was such that,

in Houston, the dancers themselves laid the wooden floor in _
the recreation house, which is still used today. In Austin, v;

square dance division of the recreation department was
ell enough organized in 1936 to promote a local folk fes-
al, which included a large section on pioneer square
nces, and to take several squares to the national folk
stival at the Texas Centennial Fair in Dallas for exhibition
rposes. During this same square dance era, Herb Greg-
erson of El Paso was dancing his square across the coun-
y to Madison Square Garden in New York City and, as
danced, the popularity of the “western” square dance

exas. His Bluebonnet Calls, first published at this time, is
ill the accepted “first” of most Texas square dancers.

No one person has done more to spread the gospel of
owboy dancing over the nation than Dr. Lloyd Shaw of
olorado Springs, Colorado. His influence has also spread
ver Texas, particularly in areas where his students have
een leaders in their communities. His annual summer
ance classes and his authentic book, Cowboy Dances, have
iven these leaders concrete teaching materials. Cowboy
ances was written essentially for the beginner and, along
ith Herb’s Bluebonnet Calls, has been a “must” in the

quare dance teacher’s library for many years.

In 1940, Amarillo, the square dance center of the Texas
anhandle, began its revival of the old-time square dance.
11 occasional dance was inserted into the evening’s pro-
ram, with each square using its own caller. WPA, realiz-
ng the importance of group recreation, secured the services
f several old-time callers, installed a public address system,
nd presto, all who wished could dance and all who danced
ould hear the caller. Now, because of its geographical
ocation and its continued effort and intense interest, Ama-
illo is no longer just a whistle stop, and it is fast becoming
‘The Crossroad of Square Dancing in America.”

With the war, the need for more and varied group enter-
ainment and group participation in recreation centers be-
ame a necessity. In Texas, as in other parts of the United
tates, service centers included square dancing as a regular
ntertainment feature. Not all of this was satisfactory—
eaders often had difficulty getting more than a few sets on
e fioor. However, many an enthusiastic square dancer
oday had his first exposure to the “never-to-be-gotten-rid-
f-square-dance-bug” during his leisure time in the service
lubs throughout the country.

The Austin Recreation Department continued to sponsor
quare dancing in its regular program and, in the fall of
1944, provided facilities for the formation of a Family
Square Dance Club. This club formed the nucleus of the
city-wide dances now held each Saturday night. There were
ome half-a-dozen private membership clubs meeting also
nd, at the request of the recreation department in the fall
of 1948, the presidents of these square and pioneer clubs
met to form our first representative City Square Dance
Council. It was to be the specific duty of this council to
{conduct the-city-wide dances heretofore run by the Family

Square Dance Club.

With duly-elected representatives, each club takes its turn
I in providing a program and callers for the dance evenings.

Almost overnight, the dances became more varied and more

interesting. New callers, new dancers, new dances, differ-

 

‘FEBRUARY 1951

me back by leaps and bounds in west and southwest-

ent music—in short, new spirit—and the dancers felt their
individual responsibility for the success of each dance.
Many cities were beginning to see the advantage of co-
ordinating the efforts of all groups of square dancers in-
stead of having a one-man show each time. The council
plan meant that more dancers were included in the plan-
ning of the dance and that more dancers, at the close of
each successful dance, reaped the benefits of knowing a job
was well done. However, even the council plan is not fool-
proof unless it is supervised and guided by an understand-
ing recreation department or other sponsoring agency. A

staggering office-tenure, rigidly enforced, for all council
members is necessary for this plan to succeed.

In Texas metropolitan areas, Dallas excepted, ’the council
is generally composed of delegates from each club, elected
by members, to represent the organization. These councils,
regardless of their geographical location, have as one of
their primary objectives and obligations the promotion and
perpetuation of the square dance. Almost invariably, they
set the standards and principles concerning square dancing
in their respective areas.

In Austin, with the beginning of the council plan, the
demand for square dance lessons increased to untold pro-
portions. Hundreds of applicants were enrolled by the rec-
reation department, seemingly almost overnight; 3 regular
square dance instructor was engaged to teach beginners,
intermediates and adVanced dancers on split schedules
four nights a week. During the summer, outdoor slabs on
all twelve city playgrounds and the outdoor slab at the
municipal clubhouse are used regularly by affiliated clubs
or interested neighborhood groups; the double tennis
courts, located in the center of town, are crowded with
enthusiasts who enroll at the beginning of the term and
continue throughout each series of lessons.

From these recreation department classes most of the
local clubs are organized. The method of organization gen-
erally follows the same pattern: a congenial, interested
group meets with the recreation department director; a
brief, flexible set of by-laws is adopted; arrangements are
made for a meeting place in one of the municipal recreation
buildings; and someone is elected to conduct the dances.
This person may or may not receive remuneration from the
club members, but because of the many opportunities avail-
able for individuals to plan and have part in conducting the
city dances under the council plan, all clubs soon fall into
a given pattern. They elect a board which acts as a club
council; the council plans the club dances with suggestions
and constructive criticism from the club members. .Thelsuc-
cess and continued growth—all clubs are limited in mem-
bership because of available space——of the Austin square
dance clubs is attributed, in large measure, to the fact that
no club regularly hires a professional to conduct the dances.
Austin probably has the most uncommercial set-up of any
square dance city its size.

This also accounts for the fact that it has no outstand-
ing square dance personality. To our knowledge, there is
no full-time professional square dancer in the Austin area.
The city dances, the clubs, even in a sense the classes con-
ducted by the recreation department, are all operated by

475

the dancers and for their benefit. Our dances and clubs
are not the largest, but we can safely say that we have the
largest number of members participating in the dance
itself—each one feeling a necessary part of the program

In 1947, the leaders of the Texas square. dancers who
came to Austin for the Inaugural Square Dance thought
that we were ready for a state organization. Thus they put
their heads together and formed the Texas Square Dance
Association. The association made several contributions
but died a slow death because of a weak foundation.

The square dancers over the state are finding the natural
solution by themselves without any one person pushing
them from the top. Just as in Austin, after the council plan
was inaugurated, clubs have sprung up all over the state.
Clubs in metropolitan areas are banding together with
elected representatives to form large councils. Where city
councils are not feasible, communities are joining to form
district associations, such as the Mid-Tex Square Dancers
Association, organized March 6, 1948; the Southwestern
Square Dancers Association, organized March 27, 1948;
the Westerners Square Dance Association, organized De-
cember 1, 1948; the South Texas Square Dance Associa-
tion, organized March 26, 1949; and the East Texas Square
Dance Council, organized April 30, 1949.

Each group varies in regard to structure, constitution,
activities—Mid-Tex, Southwestern, Western and South
Texas favoring individual memberships, and the Panhandle,
Houston and East Texas using club representatives—but
all have the same purpose: that of stimulating square dance
activities through classes, dances, festivals or jamborees,
institutes, correspondence and magazines. Specifically, the
Southwestern Square Dancers Association has, as its pur-
pose, the promotion and perpetuation of square dancing in
El Paso and the entire southwest, each member having an
equal voice in its management, with no special recognition
given to any individual club or group. It coordinates the
activities of these existing groups in assisting city and civic
organizations with special exhibitions and entertainment
when so requested, with no personal gain to any person or
club. ' That last phrase is the nucleus of the now-existing
Texas Associates. Each set of by-laws also sets forth that
the council or association shall not enter into any agree-
ment or commitment, directly or indirectly, which tends to
commercialize square dancing. Almost each association
has a specific section stating that the association or council
shall refrain from conducting, sponsoring or approving any
form of competitive square dance activity.

Unanimously, they all state that they are nonprofit or-
ganizations existing only in proportion to the interest and
support given by each square dancer and operating only as
long as they offer fun, fellowship and recreation to all mem-
bers. That these ideals are being carried out is clearly
shown in the phenomenal growth of each association within
the past year. Using the Mid-Tex Square Dancers Associa-
tion as an example, we find that although it began with
small groups varying in number from two hundred to four
hundred individuals, it now has over four thousand dancers.

Is this phenomenal growth merely caused by the fact that
the square dance craze is sweeping the 'country like a

In Austin—as in other communities—square dancing offers

prairie fire? One can scarcely believe that it is that transi-

tory. The Texas associations have learned the hard way;

they have overcome the hard knocks, petty jealousies and

personal grievances of the first attempt at state organiza-

tion. They now allow individual expression; all programs
use many callers without any of them being “the best”;

through a sort of imaginary grapevine, the jamborees and
festivals are spaced, as much as possible in a {large state like

ours, at intervals so that interested people can choose to I
travel from one district to another.

Are we ready now for a state organization? Associationsll
are still being formed—we now have eight geographical!
divisions—with more ready to organize. The dancers willl
form such an organization when they are ready for it. Itl
will come of its own accord, thrive and live forever. Let‘
us not rush it—just keep it in mind and be ready for the1
opportune time. And when it arrives, we can brag again
for, being Texas, it will have the biggest dances, the most |
members, the most gigantic publication; a sound constitu-
tion drawn up by dancers, for dancers; strong, capablel
leaders who will not commercialize; and, above all, fun and |
recreation for all. ||

its own again, and it is young America who is bring- I

ing it back. In the old days, when the corn was safely

stored in red barns or the spring planting done . . .

when John married Priscilla or a festive holiday like
Christmas came around, the farmers, their wives and

\

all the children got together for a square dance. The
dance, originating among the early colonists, traveled
westward with pioneer and covered wagon. Be it in a
New England town hall or out on a western prairie,
wherever there was a fiddler, eight people to make the
set and' a caller who knew his calls—there was a
square dance.”—From The Singing Caller.

0 PUT ON a good little theatre play, follow carefully
Tthe following recipe:

Take seventy people and work them hard for two thou-
sand hours. These people can include anyone in the com-
munity who has any of the following requirements: bakes
cakes, follows a script, turns up hems, likes rummage sales,
adores antique shops, has a station wagon; likes to hammer.
saw, paint, use a typewriter, fuss with wiring systems; is
a little bit crazy, likes to act, doesn’t like to act, likes little
theatre, prefers the professional stage, has had lots of
theatre experience, has had no theatre experience.

Starting several months before the opening night per-
formance, lose lots of sleep, neglect your friends, your
family; laugh a lot, make some friends, decide to give the
thing up, decide to stick with it; learn something about the
skills and arts which go into making a play production,
fall in love with the theatre, develop an aversion to foot-
lights and greasepaint.

If you are the director, learn to speak softly, develop a
good shout, and take a rest cure when it’s all over.

If you are a member of the cast, learn your lines quickly,
don’t learn your lines quickly, find something to fuss about
with the backstage crew, learn to get along with people.

If you are a member of the backstage crew, do your
work well, don’t do it well, find something to fuss about
with at least one member of the cast.

Mix all these ingredients until dress rehearsal, at which
time the auditorium will be the department of utter con-
fusion. Have a successful first night, give some benefits,
clip the reviews out of the newspapers, place them in your
scrapbook, take a good long rest.

Do this four times a year.

For the past twenty-one years, a group of citizens of
Montgomery County, Maryland, just over the border from
Washington, have been following this recipe with con-
siderable success. Known as the Montgomery Players, in
all their twenty-one years they have cancelled a perform-
ance only once, been in debt just once——to the extent of
fifty dollars—giving them a record which a professional
theatre group might well envy. Several of the founders are

still active, and new members are recruited each year to
give the group the balance of experience plus the new
blood it needs to continue its growth.

Last season, its twenty-first, was a big year for the
Players. Metr0politan Washington papers reviewed their
productions, and the Cub Scouts, selling tickets to a benefit,
saw to it that a record number of people saw Two Blind
Mice, a play which, by spoofing governmental process, had
the government servants who live in Montgomery County
rolling in the aisles.

The Players don’t pretend to be unique. While they are
an unusually successful little theatre group, thousands of
similar groups exist all over the country. Some are spon-
sored by schools, colleges, universities, churches and civic
and private clubs. Others, like the Players, are formed and
kept in operation by groups of ordinary citizens who differ
from their fellows only in that they were bitten-—-early or
late—by the theatre bug.

The only way to neutralize the toxic effect of this bug
is to let the disease run its course. Failure to do so, little
theatre group members insist, is to give the sufferer a bad
case of frustration. For many who love the theatre, play-
going and play-reading are not enough. For them the show
not only must go on, but must be put on by them.

A non-bitten citizen, viewing that most expendable of
all items—a little theatre play—from the audience side of
the curtain, has only a hazy idea of what is involved in
producing a play. To give you a better idea of what happens
before you view such a play, let’s move in on the Players.

Let’s watch closely as seventy of the Players work a
total of two thousand hours to produce The Winslow Boy,
by Terrence Rattigan.

All throughout the summer of 1949, the play-reading
committee of four read plays, finally choosing The Winslow
Boy as one of the four to be produced during the 1949-
1950 season. The fact that The Winslow Bay had been suc-
cessfully produced on Broadway, required one set and
suited the talents available in the group were qualities con-

bers of the Montgomery Players at work for several weeks.

sidered in its choice.

Another determining point was the fact that Hilary
Knapp, one of the group’s best directors, loved the play. It
appealed to her both as an Englishwoman and an artist.
Mrs. Knapp, a dynamic person with a great deal of pro-
fessional stage experience, took the play along with her on
her vacation. Whenever she wasn’t keeping her two children
from drowning in Chesapeake Bay, she worked on the
notebook which is the director’s Bible. Into such a note-
book, after the play has been absorbed and almost mem-
orized by the director, go scale drawings of the set for the
technical crew, notes on where each actor is every minute
of the play. Plots are made of entrances, exits and cross-
ings. Each sentence is analyzed and its proper inflection
noted. Bits of the play are cut out, scenes run together. This
notebook is the raw material for the director’s work. Addi-
tions and deletions are made up to, and through, dress
rehearsal—but the production of any play is first of all
born in the mind and imagination of the director and
noted in the book.

Once back in town, Mrs. Knapp went over the whole play
with her co-director, Mrs. Jane Plummer Rice, another
professional doing little theatre for fun. Having two di-
rectors for a play is unusual—one is usually enough and
two are one too many. But Mrs. Knapp and Mrs. Rice had
previously worked successfully together and were eager to
collaborate again, since, having two directors, if they work
in harmony together, enables both of them to act and direct
at the same time.

With the tryouts in February, work began in earnest and
continued at an ever-accelerating tempo until the play was
produced April twenty-ninth. The work of putting a play
together is done by several crews, each of them working
independently of, but in cooperation with, other crews. No
one person connected with the production, with the excep-
tion of the director, knows of the problems each crew en-
counters, and their work is not completely synchronized
until dress rehearsal.

First in importance is the cast, who begin rehearsals,

books in hand, under the single-swinging bulb of the bare
478

meeting room in the recreation center. Folding chairs
provide props; a coke machine provides refreshments dur-
ing the ten-minute “breaks.” Over and over again the same
lines are repeated. Actors stop mid-stage to query the di-
rector about gesture, voice or movement. The director calls
from the front, “John, let’s do that bit over again. I think
it would go better if you leaned forward at the end. You’re
waiting for Catherine’s response.” Scenes and acts are
rehearsed independently of each other, with the full play
being run during the last week of rehearsal. '

This grueling repetition of lines and gestures, this exact-
ing insistence upon the proper timing of crossings, entrances
and exits isn’t tedious—not if you like putting on plays.
While the Players take their rehearsals seriously, there are
plenty of occasions for good spontaneous laughter. But the
real kick comes when the play catches fire and moves along
for a time with the intensity that the dramatist intended.
It is then that the room is silent, except for the stage action.
Off-stage actors, and whatever members of the other crews 1
are present, lean forward in their chairs; the final triumph
of the theatre, the projection of emotions from actors to
audience can spellbind even those who have heard the same I
lines scores of times.

Meanwhile, the backstage crews are hard at work solving 1
production problems. If you like hard manual labor, you I
would be welcome on any technical crew in the country.
These are the boys who paint the flats, construct marble
fireplaces and walnut mantels, arrange for off-stage noises u
and thunder showers, enlarge an entrance two inches to
enable a wheelchair to go through. When the set goes up
on the wide and shallow stage at Leland Junior High
School, the actors rehearse while the hubbub of hammering
and sawing continues. Two or three of the crew perch on
high ladders, fastening flats together. Backstage the elec-
trical equipment is a tangle of wires, and when the lighting '
is set up, the foots and ceilings flash on and off as the play
is rehearsed. ‘

Any woman who dreams of redecorating her living-room
frequently should sign Up to dress the stage. These ladies
move in when the technical crew has partially finished.
Expert with needle and thread, happy with a can of paint
in their hands, perfectionists in their drive to obtain the
perfect setting, they baste slip-covers and curtains, paint
clouds and iron railings on the flats leading off the stage,
badger their friends and neighbors for the loan of just the
right vase. A single stage-dressing problem—whether to
have red or blue flowers upon the mantel——has been known
to keep them in conference together for an hour. Sometimes
major changes in the set have to be made at the last
moment. The wine-covered curtains planned for The Wins-
low Boy, for example, were too deep in tone. Somewhere,
between dress rehearsal and first night, new rust-colored ‘

 

curtains, twenty yards wide, were found.

Remember the scavenger hunts of your youth? If you
always won, you have the aptitudes necessary to be stage
and hand properties mistress. To be a properties mistress,
at least for,The Winslow Boy, you have to know where to
find a 1912 victrola, a 1913 recording of Dardanella, a

wheelchair, a 1913 telephone, an early copy of Punch—the
RECREATION

nglish humor magazine, and a c0py of the London Times
with a headline which reads “Winslow Boy Wins.” The
properties mistress finally found the victrola in the attic
next door, the wheelchair in a community nursing cup-
board, Dardanella in a second-hand shop and the 1912
telephone in a government laboratory. The headline “Wins-
low Boy Wins” was printed in large bold type and pasted
across a regular copy of the Times.

In addition to having the aptitudes of a scavenger or
beachcomber, props needs a good strong back upon which to
tote things around, a car for collecting and transporting her
finds, and sleight-of-hand ability to have ready to hand to
the actors, as they come off stage, rubbers, plates of sand-
wiches, letters, suitcases, white gloves, bouquets of flowers.
If you can also develop the ability to keep cool and not.take
offense—for props, present at all rehearsals, is likely to be
frequently shouted for and at—then props is your job.

Costuming a modern play is fairly simple, requiring
only the canvassing of the entire club membership for
proper clothes and a few purchases on the part of the
principals. But costumes really has her headaches when, as
in The Winslow Boy, the play is a period piece. Costumes
can be rented from commercial costumers, but are ex-
pensive and always need alterations. A few items can be
found in trunks and attics; but even with the aid of a whole
community, some things are hard to find. Good-Will Indus—
tries, a Washington establishment which renovates second-
hand furniture and clothes, was the source of Catherine’s
cream-colored lace gown in-the second act and Mrs. Wins-
low’s third-act hat—a charming number, circa 1913, shaped
rather like a German helmet and covering part of her eye-

brows.

Props~husband donated his father’s tails to one of the
male leads, and a collapsible opera hat was borrowed from
a neighbor. Other costuming details to be considered are
how the costumes fit into the set, and whether beads or
flowers would be best as accessories. Actors frequently need
practice in moving in their garments. Marshall Smith, who
played the part of the icy lawyer, Sir Robert Morton, is
unaccustomed, in real life, to wearing t0p hats and opera
capes. He had to practice over and over again how to hold
a cane, white gloves and an opera hat in one hand while

shaking hands with the other.

These four backstage crews—technical, stage dressing,
preps and costumes—take care of production problems.
While the actors are acting, however, and the crews produc-
ing, a third set of people is hard at work doing things
which will never be seen on stage.

 

These people include the publicity chairman, the social
director and the business manager. The Montgomery
Players’ publicity director Spends about 150 hours four
times a year publicizing their efforts. She arranges for
publicity stills, works long hours at the typewriter and
travels back and forth to town with her releases, gradually
becoming friendly with local editors and, by the waiting
and persuasion process, seeing to it that the Players get at
least some of the space that they all feel they so richly
deserve for their work.

FEBRUARY 1951

The social director arranges for the ushering and, when
Opening night comes around, serves coffee and cookies to
the hundreds of people who go backstage into the gym-
nasium after the play for the Players’ social hour.

The business manager, while all of these preparations
are going forward, takes care of reservations, pays the
bills and arranges for the printing and distribution of
programs.

After the many hours spent in preparation, the house-
lights darken in the auditorium of Leland Junior High
School. The prompter cues the actors in the wings; props
plumps up the cushion in the wing chair, checks the clock
to see that it’s timed according to the book. Two men of the
technical crew make sure that the pulley arrangement open-
ing and closing the door on stage left hasn’t jammed over-
night. The director shouts “Clear the stage”; lights plunges
the switch of the foots; the heavy curtains open and the
play is on.

Seven and a half hours of playing time later, it’s all over
—the striking of the set and the post-play party. The actors,
coming backstage from their final curtain call, congratulate
each other once again. Friends, high school groups and an
occasional critic swarm over the set which props, clad in
dirty dungarees, is dismantling. The striking crew of ten
untangles the wiring, untapes the flats, knocks out the fire-
place and lugs out the set, piecemeal, to a truck and hence
to a player’s crowded basement.

The following week, while the director is still recupera-
ting from loss of sleep by remaining incommunicado at
home, while the actors are still pasting notices in their
scrapbooks and props is still muttering “never again,” try-
outs are held by the Montgomery Players for the next play
and the whole apparatus swings into action once again.

Result? For the person who participates fun, friends, and
the knowledge of a job done as well as it could be done.
And, in Montgomery County where the Players entertain
the community year after year, and in all the other com-
munities all over the country where similar organizations
exist, little theatre keeps the laymen’s interest in the drama
alive, and provides part of the recreation needed by every

community.

February eleventh is the 104th birthday anniversary of
Thomas Alva Edison and might well be observed by all
recreation departments.

Through his innumerable inventions and discoveries-—
a record total of 1,097 patents was granted Mr. Edison by

the United States Patent office—he contributed greatly to
the present-day increase of leisure time and to recreation.

He also was especially interested in the recreation move-
ment in America through the work of his wife, who for
thirty-three years served as a member of the Board of Di-
rectors of the National Recreation Association.

Using the Resources

AST SUMMER, I found that I was going to lead a group
Lof fifteen boys, aged eight to ten, in an all-day summer
program. For me, this was nothing new. What was new,
however, was the setting in which I would be working with
the group. Our headquarters was one of the oldest schools
in New York—soon to be replaced by a new school. This
sad building was in what seemed at first glance to be a
bleak neighborhood, indeed. One of the seediest waterfront
districts of New York, it consisted of three main types of
buildings—first and dreariest, the railroad tenements; in-
terspersed among these were buildings given over to small
businesses and factories, the natures of which were hard to
discern by looking at their uniformly dirt-littered exteriors;
and last, standing out among these poor buildings, like
sleek diesel engines in a car barn of one-horse shays, were
a few large, beautifully-constructed buildings which housed
some of the outstanding manufacturing concerns of the city.

Of course, these last buildings caught the spirit as well
as the eye hrst, and I excitedly got the idea of planning my
program around visits to them—such shining examples of
the best in modern architecture and engineering. I imme-
diately set about writing to the manufacturers in the hope
of arranging visits for the group. Answers to my requests
were uniformly polite, but negative. After the first bitter
reaction, I realized that these large factories were, after all,
strangers in the neighborhood. I suspected that I had
started from the wrong end in basing my program upon
these strangers rather than upon the children and the real
neighborhood. I decided to set up the usual type of material
for the group—games, paints, clay, blocks, and so forth——
and to wait and see what interests were revealed in the way

in which the boys used them.

I hadn’t long to wait. Almost immediately, the group was
drawn to the blocks, and large “pirate ships” were soon
being built. The dramatic play around the 'pirate theme
which came with the building process was intense, but ac-
cidentally destructive. Those blocks just wouldn’t stand up
under the impact of battles between pirates and pursuers.
Too often, the pirates9 vengeance was wreaked more upon
the blocks than upon the intended victims.

What to do? The boys had shown me what I should have
guessed in the first place—that, living along the waterfront,
ships would be their main interest, translated, of course,
into terms of a boy’s love of high adventure. Certainly
walks along the waterfront and sea-yarns were in order.
And the next step was to build a boat large and sturdy
enough to allow a group of fifteen boys to dramatize their
expanding stories of adventure on the high seas. But where
would we get the materials for such a project? The price of
lumber being what it was, the play school budget certainly
couldn’t cover it.

Here I fell back upon a principle I early discovered in
my work with children—when in doubt, consult the group.
A discussion was indicated; subject, the building of a boat.
Plans were easily drawn up for its design and construction.
The next problem, where to get the wood. One boy remem-
bered that he had seen some fruit crates when he went
shopping at the super market with his mother. Another re-
membered an old barrel lying in a vacant lot nearby. Other
memories started clicking along the same lines, and it was
soon agreed that all would scour the neighborhood that
afternoon after school and bring their findings to the group
the next day.

The following morning I was greeted by the largest as:

I 'ts midst, that had ever decorated the schoolyard. “70 all
were enthused. But when we sorted and examined the wood,
0st of it was found to be either too cracked, thin or rotted
way for use. Spirits lagged. To rally our flagging hopes,
suggested an immediate trip around the neighborhood.
And a fruitful trip it was! Our first find was a large, strong
‘ratc which one of the small factories had thrown away. To
bur eyes, it was so beautiful and well-built that the boys
here sure that some mistake had been made in throwing it
way and they were for immediately running off with it
efore the error should be discovered. I realized that here
as something to discuss before we went any farther. An
mmediate curb-side conference was held concerning our
pproach in getting the wood we needed. I asked the group
0 imagine that they were the factory and shop owners. In
hat role, what would they expect of a group of boys who
rere looking for wood? They would want us to ask per-
nission before going into their building. They would want
to hear whom we were and why we wanted the wood. They
.ould want us to stay quiet and out of the way of the
workers, and they would certainly expect to be thanked for
nything that they might give us. These were simple enough
ules and were immediately put into effect. Instead of sneak-
ng away with the crate, a committee of two boys intro-
uced us and asked for it. We weren’t invited into the
actory, but we were told that we could not only have this
,crate, but that another would be waiting for us the next
day! And the following day, we were allowed to watch the
workings of this envelope-manufacturing company.
Having carted the crate back to school (incidentally, we
.were helped in carrying it by two fathers who happened
to be passing by), we sallied forth again in high spirits.
And what should we discover blif a lumberyard! The fore-
an said that we could come every day for scraps and even
ffered us burlap bags in which to carry them. On suc-
ceeding days, he conducted us on a tour of the yard, care-
ully explaining to us the differences in the types of wood
nd their uses. The boys and I compared notes and realized
that all of us had walked along-this street innumerable
times; yet not one of us had realized that behind a modest
ront office was such a tremendous shed, stacked several
tories high with enough lumber to build a thousand boats.
We decided that we had better start opening our eyes to
ur neighborhood and, during the following weeks of sum-
ner school, there was a running contest in the group to see
ow many new parts to the community we could discover.
On another morning, one of the boys brought news of a
building being torn down in the neighborhood. A trip to
the spot was quickly planned. By this time, we were skilled
in the art of presenting ourselves in a friendly manner, but

our reception on this occasion was a gruff—“Go away, no
time.” I am willing to bet that, a week before, the boys

would have aimed a few choice unmcntionable words at the
‘man and gone off grumbling. But, encouraged by their
Ihappy experiences with other grownups in the neighbor-
hood, they politely suggested that they could come back
another time. Probably to get rid of us, the boss agreed.
Much to his surprise, we came back several times, until he

had to admit that he had time. for us. And not only did
we get a pick of the old lumber being torn from the build-
ing, but we also had a chance to watch the demolition of
the building and to see, as if we were watching a movie
being run backwards, what goes into its construction.

The whole process of finding the wood to fit our building
plans took several days and brought us into contact with
many people in the community of whom none of us I teacher
included, I must admit) had been aware before. Of course.
even after we had collected our wood, we had quite a job
in removing old nails and sanding down rough places to
prevent possible injury in using it. But the final result was
well-worth the trouble—a beautiful ten-by-three-foot boat,
complete with steering wheel, rudder, cabin, portholes and
smokestacks. More than that, the result was a real lesson
learned—that behind the bleak exterior of this neighbor-
hood there were many interesting, friendly and industrious
people who were ready to help children who were friendly
and industrious, too.

Junk Playgrounds Keep Youngsters Happy

Junk playgrounds continue to play a very important role
in the leisure-time hours of English boys and girls. The
junk playground starts with a bit of waste ground, bricks.
stones, old planks, sacking, sheets of metal. cement, sand
and sometimes an old car sold for scrap. To these are
added spades and tools, an adult who can help, but won’t
“boss”—and the rest is left to the children. They often start
by digging holes and taking things apart. eventually getting
used to the equipment and then beginning to build. The
result may be a house in the trees. a special pavilion. a
“cowboy ranch,” and the like. There: is nothing permanent
about what the children build. Everything can be pulled
down and rebuilt a dozen times, but this has proved to h
just what the youngsters want.

The idea of the junk playground originall} mme Jr-a~
Denmark, and there, carried out on a larxc' a. if. -s
proved a boon for many of the children.

 

N THE PAS'I.‘ YEAR or so, a great deal
I of interest has been generated in
ways and means of reducing hazards of
falling on playground surfaces or in
producing the so-called “safe play-
ground.”

In this period, we at Goodyear have
been investigating the possibility of
employing pelletized rubber as a sur-
facing component. To date our test in-
stallations show that a pelletized rubber
surface is characterized by resiliency
and nonabrasiveness. Both of these
properties are most interesting for they
directly reduce the hazards of falling
to children at play.

The playground surface which we
will describe comprises a yielding layer
of pelletized rubber firmly bound with
asphalt to a prepared substrate.

As early as 1930, and possibly be-
fore then, scientists of the Rubber Stich-
tung, a Dutch research grouP, were
investigating the effects of powdered
rubber in asphalt. Their laboratory
studies uncovered the fact that certain
constituents of asphalt were highly
compatible with rubber and that rub-
ber asphalt mixtures had rather inter-

esting pr0perties. These findings led to
large-scale investigation of rubber-as-
phalt paving aggregates, and several
installations of test highways were laid
in EurOpe and Java.

In 1947, Goodyear began investiga-
ting synthetic rubber-asphalt mixtures
in roads, a program which eventually
led to pelletized rubber and evaluation
of this particular material in play-
ground surfacing compositions.

Without a doubt, first reports of the
use of powdered synthetic rubber in
roads stirred the imagination of many
men who visualized other new and use-
ful applications for the rubber-asphalt
blends. One of these was Mr. Bowen of
the Akron School Board, who brought
to the attention of our investigators the
need for improvement in playground
surfaces to reduce hazards of falling to
playing children.

Early consideration of possible use
of powdered synthetic rubber and simi-
lar rubber of fine particle size in play-
ground construction developed the fact
that such rubbers were not too well-
suited because of their small particle
size and cost. But the availability of
quantities of low cost rubber compound,
which could be ground into pellets of
any size, made the possibility of use of

ically feasible. [1

to whether or not pelletized rubber w

A uniform coating of aSphalt emul-
sion with adhesive is then applied to
the aggregate surface. Though the
amount. applied depends upon the na-
ture and porosity of the foundation, it
has been found that from 0.3 to 0.5 gal-
Ions per square yard is usually will-
cient. The coated area is then covered
with a uniform layer of pelletized rub-
ber. An application of from five to seven
pounds rubber per square yard is gener-
ally reeommended 0n the other hand,
for areas where falls are most likely, up
to ten pounds per square yard may be
applied. While small areas may be cov-
ered with shovel and rake, mechanical
spreading equipment will effect a more
uniform distribution, and use of such
equipment is recommended. The area
is then packed by conventional roll-
ing “equipment. This operation forces
the asphalt to effect a strong bond to
the stabilized substrate.

Should any areas be noted wherein
the asphalt has penetrated through to

the surface of the rubber covering, they
should be covered with additional rub-

ber and the area re-rolled.

The application can also be made
to areas which have been previously
stabilized, or which are already sur-
faced with sheet asphalt. conerete. as-

It is fortunate that the technique for

ground surface involves conventional
equipment and methods. This fact and
the low cost at which pelletized rubber
is available make possible resurfacing

the total area covered is about four
thousand square yards. Though these
values are naturally subject to variation
because of location, condition of orig-

similar factors, we feel that they do .

Of these, only the last provides true
cushioning and nonabrasiveness.

In conclusion, we believe that use of
pelletized rubber in playground sur-
faces effectively meets the need for a
safe play area. The resilience and free-
dom from abrasive action which char-
acterize the surface provide protection
against injuries not heretofore avail-
able. The durability of the surface after
one year’s aging is excellent, and it
appears that the surface will last suffi-
ciently long to make it economically
feasible. The initial installation costs
are well within reason.

We sincerely feel that the desirable
characteristics of these surfaces are a
step in the right direction toward im-
proving safety conditions in your play-
ground areas.

RECREATION

N A RECENT article describing a col-
lege class at its twenty-fifth reunion,
it was stated that the most “popular”
sport of these men nearing fifty was
golf, but that they found the game
“more punishment than recreation.”
The need for games suitable for the
man of middle age and over is very evi-
dent. The faults of golf are well-known
to all occasional players. It is a game
calling for such exceedingly nice nerv-
ous coordination that even profession-

 

als are notoriously uneven in their
performances, dangerous on crowded
links, unsociable in the diversity of
courses taken by the unskilled player
toward his goal, expensive in fees,
costs of lost balls and caddies. Such a
game is surely not ideal for the har-
assed, not too prosperous, not too fit,
older man of the present.

In recent years, baseball has had an
extraordinary reincarnation in the
softball game. Softball requires less
space, less equipment, is less danger-
ous, more active, more exciting, inter-
esting. The amateur and relatively oc-
casional player is less ashamed to par-
ticipate. The purpose of this brief com-
munication is to present the possibili-
ties of “softball” golf. The proposition
is that the golf ball be one-half to three-
fourths of an inch more in diameter,
of approximately the same weight and
sufficiently “soft” so that the length of
the drive would be about half what it
is at present. Sponge rubber balls meet-
ing these requirements reasonably well
can be had for a nickel! What are the

merits of this idea?

 

Dr. Pressey is professor of psychology
at Ohio State University, and for some
years has made a special study of psy-
chobgical problems of the adult years.

SOFTBALL

1. Since the ball goes about half as
far for a given stroke, there are about
twice as many strokes in a given amount
of walk, so more varied exercise and
the added interest of more shots.

2. The game is much safer—the
sponge rubber ball could hardly cause
even a slight injury.

3. Play on the fairway, in the rough
or in a trap is easier since the bigger
ball stands up more from the ground.

4. Since the bigger ball stands higher
from the ground (and also sinks down
less in grass) shots on the fairway do
not lift a divot; this should make it
easier to keep links in good condition.

5. Being larger, bright-colored and
going half as far, the ball is rarely lost.

6. In a water hazard, the ball floats.

7. With all these factors operating
to facilitate play, a round takes less
time.

8. With fewer erratic or dubbed
shots, fewer lost balls, at least twice as
many strokes in a given amount of time
and each stroke less crucial, the total
psychology of the game tends to be dif-
ferent in somewhat the same way that
the pace and psychology of softball are
different from regular baseball; soft-
ball golf should be less “punishment”
and more fun.

9. Because a stroke goes only half
as far, and the soft ball presents no
hazard to other players, twice as many
people could play on a given amount
'of land as at present or links could be

half as large.
10. With much cheaper balls and fewer

lost, and either more players on pres-
ent links or shorter courses, expense to
the player should be less. Yet because
twice as many players could partici-

pate, total fee “take” on public links
might yet be greater.

If the idea should take, the double
number of players on the same ground,
plus possible new players attracted by
the easier game, plus sale of the new
balls and perhaps, ultimately, some spe-
cial clubs, might—in total—benefit
sporting goods manufacturers as well
as owners of public links.

Various objections can be raised.
Players like to see the ball go a long
way, it will be said. There will be the
stubborn remark that it won’t be golf;
that, if a game especially suited to mid-
dle-aged dubs is desired, a new game
should he invented, rather than recom-
mendation of a poor variant on one
already established. But all these argu-
ments would have applied—most of
them did—to softball baseball. The
need is not for a new game but for
some variant that will carry the pres-
tige, the interest and most of the equip-
ment and facilities of the old. All that
is essential in the proposed change is

a different ball!
It will surely be sensed that these

suggestions are not meant to be taken
too seriously. It is believed that there

HERE WAS A DAY, when America was in the making,

that painting was considered a sin. In fact, all of the
creative arts were looked upon as devices of evil designed
to lure folks from their daily tasks and encourage them to
fritter away their time. Building a home on a bleak shore
demanded every physical and mental effort that the Puritan
colonist could give.

When, however, the home became a reality and family
pride and community tradition grew, the Brewsters and
the Howes and the Standishes became interested in having
portraits to hang over the family fireplaces and in the as-
sembly hall. Because photography was unknown, the
painter of portraits was encouraged and art was tolerated.

Since those far-off days, art has had a varied and color-
ful career innthese United States. The painter of ancestors
was followed by the painter of folk scenes; then came the
landscape, and the art-minded listened to William Cullen
Bryant’s clarion call to “go forth under the open sky and
list to nature’s teaching.” Later, the river bend and bosky
dell gave way to grand mountain scenery when Horace
Greeley boomed, “Go west, young man,” and the Lewis and
Clark expedition opened up new vistas.

There followed a period of ultra culture. Ruskin helped
imprison art in an ivory tower. “Art for art’s sake,” jeal-
ously kept painting and sculpture only for the cognoscents.
Then came the Independents, who opened the door of the
ivory tower and coaxed art out onto the sidewalk.

And now—in a glorious and jubilant now—not only are
pictures for the enjoyment of everyone—the butcher, the
baker, the candlestick maker—but painting, the actual joy
of creating, is no longer reserved for the talented few. It

can be, and is, practiced by anyone who is interested
enough to work at it. No longer does the art-minded per-
son have to make a living with his paintbox; he can, with
impunity and a clear conscience, paint to add to the joy of
living without stress or strain or sense of guilt.

The Sunday painter is a product of the progressive de-
velopment of this wonderful civilization of ours—especially
of American independence and freedom. The Sunday
painter is the you and me sort of person who takes his
easel and collapsible stool to the woods, barnyard or sea-
shore in the same spirit that his next-door neighbor takes
his golf clubs to the links or his racquet to the tennis or
squash court.

Too few of us have learned, at first hand, the fun that
is enjoyed by the Sunday painter. I think that I know all
the arguments. I have coaxed groups to try sketching and
painting from coast to coast and from border to border.
I should be astonished and somewhat disappointed if I did
not hear, “I can’t draw a straight line”; “I’m not talented”;
or “I have an uncle who can draw anything but I didn’t in-
herit the family talent.” There are many others, such as
“I tried once and I wish you’d see . . .” and “You can say
‘anyone can draw’ but you don’t know me.”

I’d be astonished not to hear these arguments because
I have never yet met a group who didn’t advance them; and
I’d be disappointed because I’m all ready. with the answers.
If I ever met with a' group who didn’t break out into a rash
of “I can’t do its,” I’d have to work out some new approach
to promoting painting as a valuable recreation asset; and
I love to promote this particular activity—just as we all
love to promote any interest that presents opportunity for
growth, for development, for new learning and widening
horizons. It is engrossing, it is rich in new enthusiasms;
it leads into appreciation of pictures in museums and pri-
vate exhibits and opens new avenues of reading. It makes

new friends for us. Our workshop in Winston-Salem even

points with pride to a very happy marriage that began on
our sketching outings.

We definitely discourage the use of the word “talented.”
We believe that people can do anything they want to do
if they are interested enough to make the necessary effort,
if they enjoy it and if they don’t start at the wrong end—
for they must first learn to swim before they can attempt
to swim the English Channel.

“First steps first” is animportant thing to learn in al-
most everything, and is especially true of Sunday painting.
Learn to draw simple objects before venturing forth to
paint landscapes. John Sloane, in his book, Gist of Art, sug-
gests that we do practice work on the five solids—the
sphere, the cube, the cone, the cylinder and the pyramid.
Set up groups of these and draw—and draw—and draw—
from the objects themselves—never copy. An oatmeal box,
a tennis ball or an orange, an ice cream cone container, a
matchbox—these will provide the models. Draw them large
—-as nearly the size of the objects as your paper will per-
mit. Do not draw as you write—with the periphery of the
fingers that grasp the-pencil—use a good free swing from
the elbow and don’t be discouraged if the sphere doesn’t
look round at first or the cube square. It’s only practice,
five-finger exercises. Make up your mind to learn as you
did when you learned to swim or play golf; try, try again.

When you feel more or less confident, then start out
some Saturday or Sunday afternoon with a thermos jug of
coffee and a package of sandwiches. My favorite medium
is water color and I fare forth with a canvas bag—a khaki
bag from World War II supplies—swinging from my
shoulder. In the bag besides the lunch is a mason jar for
water, a folding aluminum palette, some good sable brushes
-——I like a three-quarter-inch wide brush, and one small,
pointed brush for small details—some soft rags and my
~paints. The transparent water colors in tubes are my choice,
but the cake paints are satisfactory. You will find that ex-
perimentation in the choice of colors will develop individ-
ual preferences. The following colors, however, make a
good palette: Allizarine crimson, Thalo blue, Indian yellow,
Van Dyke brown, ivory black, Paynes gray and Than
green. Under one arm, I have a paper block, at least twelve-
by-eighteen inches of heavy water-color paper—I like a
rather rough surface—and, under the other arm, a small
folding stool.

This is a good place to mention the cost of materials.
For water colors, it is important that you buy the best. Buy
fewer paints if you must, but don’t buy cheap paints,
brushes or paper. After all, you don’t play tennis with a
child’s rubber ball and a toy racquet!

Having arrived at my chosen scene, I pick out a good
spot where I can sit in the shade-—it is difficult to paint on
a paper block that is in glaring sunlight—wand look for a
reasonably interesting composition—a barn, a house, a
doorway. Don’t attempt rocks, animals or people on your
first trip; keep ydur composition simple and eliminate de-
tails. Study the shape of shadow and the shape of light—
remember the five solids; the barn is an elaboration of the
cube, the tree trunk or the silo of the cylinder. Decide what

you are going to put into your picture and what you will
leave out. Study it carefully, then draw lightly with a pen-
cil on your paper. The paint, when applied, dyes the paper
under the pencil mark, making it possible, if desired, to
erase the marks after the picture is painted.

Before painting, the paper should be dampened evenly.

from light to dark, using number one as the lightest.

a picture.

WHAT ABOUT
FREE PLA Y? =

Ernest Ehrke is director of the harbor
district of the Department of Recrea-
tion and Parks in Los Angeles, California

PUBLIC RECREATION departments of
today rightly emphasize the obvi-
ous importance of good leadership, as
indicated in a well-balanced program
of activities conducted and directed by
skilled staff. Thus the recreation direc-
tor is mostly concerned with the pro-
motion, organization and conduct of
classes, leagues, clubs, contests, tourna-

q
‘

ments, group activities and Special
events of all kinds and for all ages.
This is as it should be, of course.

Public recreation departments are, at
the same time, serving quite silently
and without fanfare those multitudes of
citizens who prefer the spontaneous use
of recreation facilities. I refer to those
who dr0p in to participate in “free
play” whenever time or personal inter-
est permits.

It is obvious that this vast army of
free-play patrons comes voluntarily to
seek opportunities for leisure-time hap-
piness through informal use of such fa-
cilities. These people expect, or prefer,
to provide their own leadership, and
are probably too busy to join recurrent
classes or to attend activities conducted
by staff.

Let -us never underestimate the im-
portance of this service rendered to

488

those who come and go—day and night,
of all ages and with all varieties of in-
terests—in this continual river-of-activ-
ity called “free play.” Let us never take
these “free players” for granted and, by
the shades of Joseph Lee, let us never,
never ignore these citizens, but rather
regard them as representative of the
basic fundamentals which justify, if
you will, the very existence of play-
grounds and recreation centers.

Granted? Then let’s consider the
subject objectively; let’s ask ourselves
how we may better be able to satisfy
this need and discuss a few ways in
which we may stimulate and encourage
more of this informal free-play use of
our recreation facilities. How can this
be done?

First, we can make our public recre-
ation centers more attractive! Let’s
admit that many of our older recrea-
tion centers are cheerless, colorless,
drab and uninviting. Your reply is that
this is because of the lack of funds-—
perhaps blaming that ole rascal, the
budget. I would disagree, for it is my
contention that it may cost no more to
plan attractive facilities than to oper-
ate something which is ugly.

On a recent tour, my wife and I had

the pleasure of visiting recreation cen- 1
ters across the nation. Many were
streamlined, modern, attractive; others I
were surprisingly dismal. Often Iwould '
test the efficacy of a certain recreation
center by turning to my wife and ask-
ing her if she would want our children

to spend their leisure time here. Need-

less to say, her answer too often was
“No!”

Many of these unattractive recrea-
tion areas are “leftovers” from the
early days—-built thirty or forty years
ago and still doing a rugged type of
duty; constructed when it was consid-
ered practical by some departments to
make such “playgrounds” solid—of
cement, steel, blacktop, brick and mor-
tar—unpainted, and with no thought
for landscaping or natural beauty,
much less man-made beauty. Ugly, un-
clean, gloomy—these words should
have no place in the recreation system ‘
of today. It is unfortunate that the\,
potential patron in such neighborhoods l
has no choice, unless he would go to
some other part of the city or seek his
recreation in commercial establish-
ments; and could you blame him?

What a genuinely joyful experience 
it is, by way of contrast, to visit a

RECREATION

 

modern, well-planned recreation center.
Designed for service, yes, but some-
thing more—inviting and alluring in
potentialities, beckoning to you and to
me. Why? Because it is cheerfully neat
and attractive. Note the miraculous ef-
fect of harmonious color combinations,
the simplicity of design, the charm of
arrangement wherein the community
building andlandscaping, plus appara-
tus and outdoor facilities, are all tied
together into one pleasing, yet practi-
cal, picture.

Note, too, the colorful, well-planned
arrangement of indoor facilities—the
auditorium and stage, the gymnasium
and club rooms, with special provisions
for hobbies and crafts and with a spic
and span kitchen. Observe the strate-
gically-located, cleverly-arranged office
for the recreation staff. Inspect the
modern, clean comfort stations, change-
rOoms and showers.

Here is pleasing evidence of a de-
sign for recreation, of facilities so well-
planned and so skillfully maintained as
to be functional, yet inviting, profes-
sionally efficient, yet attractive. Here,
too, is evidence that public recreation
is accepted and demanded in all neigh-
borhoods—rich and poor, normal and
subnormal, in new subdivisions as well
as in slums. The citizen of today is
conscious of the fact that his tax money
helped build these tennis courts, that
swimming pool, this auditorium. He is
"recreation-conscious,” and feels that
he has a right to expect these facilities
to be readily available for the free-
play use of himself, his family and his
neighbors.

As we visit these streamlined recrea-
tion centers with the “new look,” we
swell with pride for they represent the
progress of our profession—tremen-
dous strides in a few short years—and
we are a part of this movement.

This is quite different from when you
and I were children. This will serve the
people well—a recreation system with
carefully-planned centers which are at-
tractive to all citizens. The well-planned,
well-operated and well-maintained play-
ground of today beckons and invites
you and me to enter, thus encouraging

and motivatinc1r participation in free

D
play.
But there must be something else.
There must be a staff of employees, and

FEBRUARY 195 l

 

Recreation departments serve a vast army of free-play patrons who prefer sponta-

neous use of facilities.

the attitude of these employees is a
vital factor affecting the popularity and
success of a recreation center. Our pa-
trons, with very few exceptions, will
react favorably if they are encouraged
by friendly, enthusiastic attitudes.

Such an attitude spells the happy‘
answer—a staff of employees who
practice good salesmanship! \Ve need
recreation directors and maintenance
employees who radiate enthusiasm, sin-
cerely like peOple and are eager to be
helpful. Such employees not only “sell”
themselves (we call this good person-
ality), but sell the services of the rec-
reation center (we call this leadership)
and, in turn, the quality and worth-
whileness of their departments, directly
to the taXpayers who foot the hill!

Thus good salesmanship is a vital in-
gredient of good leadership. It is that
“spark” of personality which makes
friends and influences people. And it
is contagious, for such cheerful enthusi-
asm encourages and stimulates visitors.

From the standpoint of good public
relations, and as an aid to the motiva-
tion of free play at a recreation center,
I would rate this quality of good sales-
manship or personality and sincere en-
thusiasm as being far more important
than mere individual skills in specific
activities. The greatest skill involved in
the operation of a recreation center is
surely that which creates the friendly
respect and interest of the citizens in
the use of these facilities. The major

They are potential candidates for more formal classes.

over-all objective of public recreation
is to organize the community for rec-
reation, and this can best be acrom-
plished through good salesmanship.

So, if the recreation employee is sin-
cerely friendly, understanding and help-
ful, he will soon gain the respect and
good will of the people. Such a director
will naturally stimulate free play and,
in doing so, will find many patrons of
free play who would be interested in
participating in the organized activities
program. The golden rule of recreation
service leans heavily upon the individ-
ual employee.

So vitally important is this attribute
of public service that it would be my
sincere recommendation that all recre-
ation departments include a thorough
course in the principles of salesmanship
in their in-service training curriculum.

We who are working in public recrea-
tion have something to sell and much
of which to be proud. Let’s not be so
bashful about it. Let’s not forget that
the free-play use of recreation facilities
provides the initial introduction to our
centers for literally multitudes of visi-
tors yearly. And these visitors are not
only active participants in free play. but
are a potential source of candidates for
all the formally-organized classes.

Who knows? Perhaps some. day mu

our personal recreation and will hav

Campers were well-received during tour;
Welland’s Mayor Dquin was impressed.

“I LIKE THESE samples of Kentucky
youth,” said Mayor Harry Duflin

of Welland, Ontario, to Charlie Vet-
tiner, director of the “Jefferson County

Plan” of rural recreation. “How were -

they selected for this trip?”

The occasion was the second annual
Camp-on-Tour, sponsored by the J effer-
son County, Kentucky, Playground and
Recreation Board. Eighty boys and
girls, about evenly divided in number,
traveling in two air-conditioned Grey-
hound buses, a Scout car and equip-
ment truck, were making a 1,200-mile
tour from Louisville to Niagara Falls
and Canada this past summer. In Wel-
land, they had stopped for lunch at a
hotel. Before they left, they had been
showered with compliments and praise
for their appearance and conduct.

There was nothing unusual in the
reception that the boys and girls re-
ceived in Welland. The same sponta-
neous welcome was accorded the camp
ers wherever they stopped.

Actually, there is no election, special
contest or single event that decides who
shall become a member of the Camp-
on-Tour caravan. Throughout the year,
boys and girls participate in community
programs, give assistance in county-
wide events, develop certain talents,
take part in dramatic programs, enter
county-wide athletic contests, attend
summer camps, compete in the Junior
Olympiad and in many other activities,
building credits without fanfare.

Highlight of County

Recreation Program

Just before the Camp-on-Tour takes
place, such credits are totaled. Those
with the greatest number of points are
notified of their eligibility.

The important feature is that the
question of qualification is decided by
hairline decisions. Hundreds are actu-
ally qualified so far as good conduct,
contribution to recreation, health stand-
ards, talent development and good cit-
izenship are concerned. The fortunate
eighty are those who have exerted them-

selves a trifle more than the others,-

whose participation has been a bit great-
er and whose interest in recreation has

been, to some degree, more definite.

The final result is a group of boys
and girls who travel together for five
days, camping out at night, preparing
evening meals, meeting and entertain-
ing crowds in various cities and towns
-—-—and without a single case of serious
accident or illness; no disciplinary prob-
lems; livinghlaughing and enjoying
themselves in a manner that draws won-
der and praise from every place they
visit. This is an example of the results
of a rural recreation program with its
ears open to the wishes of the individ-
uals and community which it serves.
The eighty boys and girls are repre-
sentative of hundreds of others whose
talents and recreation habits have been
developed through a program that is
primarily responsive to the people.

To understand fully the significance
of the Camp-on-Tour, it is necessary

to know something of the “Jefferson
County Plan” of rural recreation.
Founded and operated on the policy of
cooperative effort, results after six years
of trail-blazing are significant.

This method of centrally-sponsored
recreation for rural communities pre-
serves the individuality of each of the
thirty-three community centers. These
centers, each directed by a local recre-
ation committee, decide just what the
recreation program of their community
will be. The question of how much or
how little, how confined or how exten-
sive the program will be, is the respon-
sibility of these committees. Because
of this provision, recreation in Jeffer-
son County has developed freely and
without program pressure.

Thus the activities have their incep-
tion in the roots of the program and
the entire plan becomes an outstanding
example of free cooperation.

The Jefferson County Playground
and Recreation Board stands as an
agent in relation to the committees
making possible the development of the
communities’ recreation, supplying su-
pervision and information and coor-
dinating the work of the communities.

Last year, the Louisville Chamber of
Commerce designated the 1950 campers

HOW MANY of you have taken ad-

vantage of the ideas and pro-
gram helps which come to you each
month via RECREATION—the magazine
expressly planned for recreation lead-
ers? How many have found out how to
put the magazine to work in a given
situation?

One of the best of many possible
ways is to use it as a measuring rod, to
extend the horizons of existing recrea-
tion programs or in starting new ones.

Probably no two persons and no two
recreation programs would follow the
same procedure or find the same values
in the various articles in any particu-
lar issue. Actually, such must be the
case, for each group must consider the
practicality of the magazine material
and suggested program plans in rela-
. tion to its own recreation climate,
needs and experiences. It is to be hoped
that any workable plan growing out of
the points of view in this article will
serve to stimulate imagination and de-
veIOp initiative. RECREATION magazine
is a leader of thought, the advanced
guard of points of view, a propellor in
ideas and ideals and a practical tabu-
lator of how these ideas and ideals may
be, and have been, worked out. It also
can be used as a springboard for
growth. One group of recreation seek-
ers established this fact to its own satis-
faction with the following results.

“Imagine finding what I most need
to help me plan my program right here
under my nose,” said an enthusiastic
member of the course in leadership
training, as she thumbed through an

How to Use RECREATION Magazine

for Program Planning

Results of Experimentation in a
Recreation Leadership Training Course

old RECREATION magazine.

We had, you see, spent a part of each
class in discovering not only how to
develop certain skills and techniques in
leadership training, but also in setting
11p programs of both long and short
durations in which all such skills and
related activities might be developed
and utilized.

The “core” of our information for
program planning and directing was
discovered in the magazine. Therefore
RECREATION became, for that group at
least, a valuable resource. In one issue
alone there was coverage of a program
in physical activities with correlated
and integrated aspects. One need not be
at sea as to the depth and breadth of a
well-balanced, year-round program of
physical recreation. Likewise, proce-
dures in the development of certain skills
and techniques in the area of creative
recreation and organization were point-
ed out. Answers to the questions
“What?” “Why?” and “How?” were
there, and the group settled down to
study the August, 1942, issue.

Those members desiring similar in-
formation and seeking an answer to the
same problems gravitated toward each
other—so that‘there developed a nat-
ural subdivision of the group, accord-
ing to each felt need. Each group, so
formed, posed certain questions and
proceeded to search for the answers in
the magazine.

The groups were designated I, I l and
III, according to the problems consid-
ered. Group number I concerned itself
with the organizing and financing of a
recreation program in a small commu-
nity where a small budget might make
such a program seem prohibitive. Group
II was anxious to find a method of initi-

ating a physical program that would
not degenerate into a mere sports pro-
gram. Group number 111 felt a need to
broaden and enrich the lives of the peo-
ple of the community by introducing
creative and cultural activities. May I
add that in the case of Group III, no
such program had ever been introduced
into their various situations as a part
of recreation activities; therefore, the
bolstering of courage through the suc-
cess of such programs as recorded in
RECREATION was as useful as the “how”
information. Teachers in the group
were especially interested in the crea-
tive program as a possible mhool ac-
tivity.

In order to focus attention upon in-
formation which each group considered
important, the following problems were
posed:

Group I selected an article entitled,
“Recreation On Its Own,” by Frederick
Martin, Director of Recreation, Brattl-e-
boro, Vermont.

Problem: Can a community provide
an adequate, well-rounded program
with a completely inadequate budget?

An answer to this was found in Brat-
tleboro through an active, cooperative
venture including the participation of
all community groups and the ingenu-
ity, resourcefulness and manual labor
of many of the citizens. Their experi-
ence was broken down into:

Procedure—To insure such coopera-
tion and group participation, contacts
were made with the welfare depart-
ment, highway department, fire and
police, local industries, business groups,
newspapers, utility department, frater-
nal organizations, veterans of foreign
wars, young men’s clubs, flower and
women’s clubs, ball teams and leagues,

491

lay people, staff and volunteers.

Results—Newspapers took ‘over the
task of publicizing and reporting needs
and appeals. Local industries supplied
sports material—badminton rackets,
tennis paddles, courts, hockey sticks,
paints and supplies for shop work. The
local utility department provided light-
ing for night skating. The highway de-
partment supplied shanty and stove for
skaters and built other equipment. Staff
members made and repaired play-
ground swings, constructed two multi-
ple-use playing surfaces for tennis, bad-
n1inton, volleyball, put up backboards,
made nets and painted lines.

Taking the above information as a
guide, each member of the group ex-
amined his own community situation
with the idea of using, wherever pos-
sible, similar techniques.

Group II found another article,
“Helping Young America Keep Fit,”
by Robert E. Link, especially pertinent
because of its correlative and integra-
tive nature. Such material could be
used by directors, staff members, vol-
unteer leaders, participants who desire
to give and to receive a broader activ-
ity base than is generally found in the
average physical program.

Problem: How can a program in
physical recreation be developed that
will provide leadership and give to in-
dividuals and groups an opportunity to
act in situations which are healthy,
stimulating, satisfying?

A thorough study of Mr. Link’s ar-
ticle revealed that, in his community,
this was accomplished through a pro-
gram of physical fitness by:

1. Careful preparation of leaders and
groups in fundamental objectives by
means of —

A. Staff and volunteer discussions.

B. BOys’ and girls’ athletic commit-
tee discussions.

C. Distribution of bulletins.

D. Talks and discussions by physical
director and club groups.

B. Bulletin boards.

2. Program activities—

Basic Physical Program for Boys:
track and field, basketball skills, base-
ball skills, football skills, boxing, gym-
nastics, water sports, intramural hand-
ball tournament.

Girls” Program: track and field, bas-
ketball skills, softball skills, badminton

492

skills, gymnastics, water sports, volley-
ball intramural tournament.

3. Correlated activities as a part of
physical jitness program —

A. Social recreation games and party
program activities, dancing—square,
folk and modern.

B. A corrective physical based upon
individual needs.

C. Social hours in form of supper
night programs—members preparing
food under guidance of leader.

D. First-aid classes as part of health
interests.

E. Visual aids and movies to point
up needs of better health.

F. Interclub newspaper on health
and physical fitness.

C. Development of new hobbies by
club members.

H. Exchange of ideas with another
club through correspondence.

I. Organization of-fitness club for
leaders at completion of “fitness”
course.

J. Dramatizations, carnivals, exhibits.

K. An essay contest based upon
physical fitness theme.

L. The working out and keeping of
one’s own physical fitness record rather
than stressing competitive angle.

In the group discussion, emphasis
was placed upon the c00perative nature
of activities in which the values of
group association and relationships are
as important as the activities themselves.
To achieve this, Mr. Link had instituted
discussions of program objectives with
staff and club advisors. Organization
had developed “through clu-b groups,
committees, individual participants,
staff members and club advisors.

Group members asked themselves the
question: How nearly does our own
physical program approximate the
above?

Group III attacked with enthusiasm
an article entitled: “All the People,” by
Edward I. Ronshein, Director of Rec-
reation, Anderson, Indiana.

Problem: How shall a creative pro—
gram be initiated in a community
where one has never been developed?

A thorough study of the article as to
the “how” of such a program revealed:

1. Objective—Anderson’s manifesto:
“For ‘all the people’——not only the base-
ball players and picnickers, but the
people who want to participate in

music, drama and activities of all
kinds.”

2. The “core” of activity was music.
(Note—The group realized that arts
and crafts, drama, storytelling, the
dance or even a creative physical pro-
gram could be so used.)

3. Planned program—Coordination'

of park activities with private organi-

zations, schools and music groups to'
establish summer vocal and instrumen- .

tal groups in the recreation program.
The recreation program brought to
those who had either previous training
or none a chance to learn and perform
during the summer months.

Some Results—Schools opened build-
ings, supplied instruments. Teachers of
various branches of music were used
as instructors. Hordes of boys and girls
attended summer classes; ages were

from six to sixteen years. Hundreds par- .

ticipated in programs purposely de-
veloped to give experience. Vocal groups
appeared in practice programs at re-
unions, picnics, in city-wide indoor pro-
grams and on the radio.

Activities for younger groups in-
cluded rhythm bands, musical games,
folk songs and dances; tfor adults, an
amphion chorus and the mothers’ choral
organization. Art instruction was given
out-of—doors.

In an arts and crafts program, more
boys and girls learned special crafts
work out-of—doors than played on junior
baseball teams. There was a team for
every fifteen hundred persons. Specta-
tors for performances given by the
music group equalled the number who
turned out for all-star baseball finals.

Group III realized that this Specific
project, with the already-organized
music groups, would not necessarily be
possible in other communities. But since
there are few communities where some
form of creative work is not being done,
here in this article were certain tech-
niques and approaches which were good
points of departure for a wider creative
program.

Leadership techniques and program
content, to be found in the magazine,
can be equally helpful to leaders of rec-
reation groups anywhere-——in private
as well as public agencies, institutions,
schools, churches and the like. Why
not take on such research as a project
for some of your groups?

BIGGER and BETTER Bull Sessions

Do you some-
times feel that
your conversa-
tions are not
up to snuff?
Not your nec-

 

and social conversations, of course, but the ones in which
you and your friends discuss matters of general importance
in today’s world? 5

Too often, when talk comes to communism, super-weap-
ons, labor problems, morals, religion or other controversial
subjects, one hears a few superficial observations and the
subject drifts to something else. Our freedom of speech on
such topics is left in too large a part to be exercised by
newspaper columnists, radio commentators and clergymen.
‘A little discussion of them by groups of ordinary citizens
can be instructive, stimulating and just plain fun. _

One day in a Los Angeles suburb, two fellows in their
mid-twenties, who were good friends in spite of the fact that
they disagreed on nearly all arguable subjects, were talking
about this lack of exchange of serious ideas among most
people. They decided to organize a discussion group among
their friends.

In talking to their acquaintances, whose leanings ranged
from socialism to staunch Republicanism in the field of
politics, and from atheism to fundamentalism on the sub-
ject of religion, it was agreed that the idea was worth a
try anyway.

At the first meeting, held in a private home and attended
by about fifteen persons, a minister from a nearby eongre-
gational church, highly respected in the community and
known for his liberal views, was invited as speaker. He
talked informally for about forty-five minutes on his in-
terpretation of the Bible.

After he finished, opposing arguments were presented
and questions asked. Some felt that the minister did not

take the Bible literally enough; others thought that he took
it too literally. In spite of the fact that no one presided
over the meeting, the group generally observed the courtesy
of letting one person speak at a time. Naturally, some
spoke more than others, but no one hogged the entire con-
versation.

At about ten o’clock everyone adjourned to the dining-
room for coffee and cake and, for the next hour or 50,
groups of threes and fours carried on the discussion.

Since that time, two years ago, meetings along the same
general pattern have been held monthly at homes of dif-
ferent members. Average attendance is about twenty-five,
with latecomers sometimes having to sit on the Hoor.

The range of subjects which intrigues the interest of the
group is shown in the list of speakers: 3 Jewish rabbi, a
fundamentalist pastor, a professor of economics, Republi-
can and Democrat Congressional candidates, a techno-
crat, a world federalist, a geneticist, a professor of Chinese
philosophy, a professor of the philosophy of aesthetics, a
child psychologist, a general semanticist, an artist, a for-
mer diplomat and a representative of the American Medi-
cal Association speaking against socialized medicine.

At first, some members of the group feared that the
supply of interesting subjects and speakers would soon run
dry, but the opposite was found to be true. There always
has been a backlog of good suggestions.

Almost all of the speakers have been excellent. Program
chairmen, who are appointed at one meeting to secure a
speaker for the next, have found that when the nature of
the group is described, a potential speaker is usually very
eager to come. When the program chairman tells him that
the group prides itself upon its diverse elements and that
no matter what his thesis may be he is sure to get some
lively argument. he takes it as a challenge. In this way. the
group often gets speakers who ordinarily would not appear
before such a small audience.

Although discussion occasionally becomes heated. it h.“-
never once really been out of hand. Quite nften. pets-c" rl

are almost always in a humorous, and not in a bitter, vein.
Some meetings, sm #11 as the ones with the geneticist and the
artist, have been almost entirely informative, involving
very little argument.

A prime reason for the group’s success is its complete
informality. The next subject, program chairman and meet-
ing place are decided in a matter of minutes before the
evening’s speaker begins. A secretary sends out postal
cards informing members of the speaker and location about
a week before each meeting. Anyone who cares to come is
automatically a member. Dues consist of giving a nickel
to the secretary every few months to buy postal cards and
settling up with the refreshments chairman after meetings.

Although discussion groups of various kinds are as old
as civilization, this particular pattern has been found singu-
larly successful. It is very'little trouble and participants

 

The Theatre Comes to the Community

HE ESTABLISHMENT of a community theatre in a neigh-
Tborhood brings with it many benefits. Aside from pro-
viding experience and employment for actors and stage
personnel, it offers an opportunity to see “live theatre” at
its best. Above all, it makes good use of light, excellent
dramatic literature which, without the community theatre,
might be lost for years.

The task of bringing the theatre to the community is not
easy or simple. For example, a local school auditorium,
although satisfactory for amateur productions, must be re-
equipped or modified as economically as possible to meet
the needs of a professional troupe. Additional curtains and
drapes must be installed and hung properly. A sound
system, especially adapted to pick up speech from any part
of the stage, is a necessity in many of our auditoriums
which are notorious for their poor acoustical qualities.

“More important, perhaps, is the task of obtaining whole-
hearted cooperation from the principal, his assistants and
teachers who must bear some of the inconveniences which
are bound to result from the staging of plays by “outside”
groups.

The publicity and exploitation required for the success-
ful sale of tickets involve certain know-how and a tremen-
dous amount of work. Very essential is the cooperation of
leaders of various parent-teachers associations, civic asso-
ciations and other groups who must actively support the
theatre by selling sizeahle blocks of seats to their members
and associates. In short, everyone in the community must
take part in establishing the theatre on a financially sound
and lasting basis.

As a move to re-establish the theatre as a normal part of
community life, the Board of Education of the City of New
York and Actors’ Equity formed “The Equity Community

,the same because their members have different interest

enjoy it. At the same time, it is both informative an
provocative.

  
    
 
   
  
   
  
 

As one member said: “Sometimes my mind is so stimu-
lated after a meeting that I lie awake for an hour after-
wards, thinking about whatever we’ve been discussing."

Although no effort has been expended by members, a
least two other similar groups have sprung up in nearb
communities. Naturally, their arrangement is not exact]

and circumstances. Any group should be'able to‘adopt th
general idea and to make minor modifications. In rura
areas it might be a problem to secure good speakers, bu
this difficulty should not be an insurmountable obstacle.
Regardless of the subjects chosen, the discussion grou
meets a definite need in providing a friendly arena wher
current ideas can be thrashed out by the people themselves.

Theatre” last year. The experiment was tried in the DeWitt
Clinton High School, where sixteen performances of four
productions were given.

Step number one in the initiation of the project was a
survey of the physical equipment of the auditorium and its
stage. This was followed by a meeting of both Equity and
Board of Education representatives to prepare an operating
budget, select the plays to be given and outline the frame-
work for the operation of the several divisions charged with
sale of tickets, publicity, production and other matters.

  

William Saroyan’s My Heart’s in the Highlands was
selected for the initial performance, followed by Shaw’s St.
Joan, Goodrich and Hackett’s The Great Big Doorstep and
Sidney Howard’s Lucky Sam McCarver. Each play was
scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings and
Sunday matinee. Two weeks intervened between each pro-

duction and the entire series required about seven weeks.
{

Since most of the publicity and sale of tickets was carried
on from the school, the principal provided a small furnished
office. Through this office flowed an endless stream of ma-
terial. Posters were prepared and sent to the local mer-
chants for display in their windows. Leaflets, announce-
ments and subscription blanks were mailed and distributed.
An intense drive was made through personal contacts and
by telephone. Schools in the neighborhood were visited as 1
well as leading business houses. Press releases were sent
out daily to local newspapers and radio stations. There
was no “let-up” in the stream of outgoing literature until
the last play was over.

The outcome of the project on the whole was gratifying.
Measured in terms of numbers, more than twelve thousand
persons attended the series of plays. To many, this was
their first experience with “live theatre,” and they liked it.
Hopes are high for successful future runs which will insure
the expansion of the Equity Community Theatre.

OOPERATION

 

 

brings Diamonds __®___

' to Peoria . . .

RECREATION, school and park oflicials in Peoria, Illi-
nois, have taken effective steps to provide additional
baseball diamonds for their city. The pr0perties of the
Peoria Park District are, for the most part, outside or near
city limits, and its interior areas have little level ground
where diamonds can be constructed. The older school sites
have meager play space—although recently-built schools
have good-sized tracts, thanks to a forward-looking board
of education. School funds have not been available, how-
ever, for the deveIOpment of these areas for recreation use.

Following a survey which showed that Peoria had only
about forty-five per cent as many diamonds as a city of its
size should, recreation oflicials took the lead in calling to-
gether representatives of the board of education, the park
board and the recreation board to see what could be done
to deve10p additional ball diamonds. As a result of several
meetings, the three groups agreed to a plan whereby the
recreation board would prepare and lay out ball diamonds
on three areas containing eight, ten and twelve acres, re-
spectively; the. board of education would erect the back-
stops and be responsible for mowing the grass; and the
park board would lend technical advice and heavy grading
equipment.

The areas were graded during the summer, but disking
and harrowing were delayed until the start of school in the
fall. With the cooperation of the assistant superintendent
of schools, principals and teachers, the recreation board
devised a plan to permit students to participate in the de-

ve10pment of the diamonds.

Principals and teachers explained to students the neces-
sity of growing-turf on the area. The director of building
Operations for the school board, whose hobby for the past
twenty-five years has been the study of grass, gave talks to
students on the technique of growing a beautiful lawn. The
superintendent of recreation spoke on the costs involved.
The students responded with enthusiasm. Math students
figured the acreage to be seeded, the amount of seed re-
quired, the cost of the job and the boundaries of the field.

While this was being done, students in English and
social studies classes considered the pupils' responsibility
in maintaining and protecting the fields after they were
seeded. After the areas were prepared, boys in the upper
grades, using rotary hand seeders, sowed the areas with
grass seed. Almost every boy was given an opportunity to
seed one strip across the field. Others mixed the seed and
filled the seeders. Using the platoon system, teachers kept
a steady stream of substitutes reporting to the maintenance
supervisor, who directed the operation.

Immediately following completion of the seeding, signs
were erected which had been prepared in woodcraft and art
classes. The girls participated by thinking up unique titles
and painting signs. Trite “Keep Off the Cra$” type of signs
were conSpicuous by their absence. Almost all the signs
contained good salesmanship in their titles, and some used
pictures of a foot about to step upon the grass. Among the
more unique titles were: “Hey, Toots Keep Off My Roots ;
“Stop It, You’re Killing Me, Signed, \lr. Vew Crass _.
“Please, Give Me a Chance to Live. Signed, New urns-s";

The young grass is sprouting, and the value of the co-
operation of the school children has already been demon- I
strated. They have raised “Ned” with two stray bicycle
riders and a housewife looking for a short cut home for

trespassing on “their grass.”

Since adult softball teams will use a portion of the
fourteen new diamonds, they, too, were given an oppor-
tunity “to get into the act.” Recreation board ofiicials or-
ganized “operation parking lots.” Old five-inch steel boiler
tubes, cut into four-and-one-half-foot lengths were donated
by the Keystone Steel and Wire Company. A dozen post
hole diggers were borrowed from local contractors and the I
park board. While a dozen of the softball players dug 1
holes, others followed them, placing the tubes into the holes I
and filling the holes with concrete. In this manner, park- I
ing lots adjacent to the fields were fenced off.

The board of education, the recreation board, the park
board, the school children, the adult softballers, local firms '
and contractors—all have participated in the project. In
congratulating the “recreation board upon its enlistment of
students in the undertaking, The Peoria Journal commented: |
“They will have a far greater interest in the diamonds be-
cause of the part which they have had in their preparation.” I

ADMINISTRATIVE
PLANNING

Its Effective! Use

"Blakng the budget worth every dollar} ’9

PART II

N THE HISTORY of public finance, the notion that public

funds should be used for such purposes as provision of
recreation services is a relatively new one. From the eco-
nomic doctrines of Adam Smith to the present time, there
has been evolving a phiIOSOphy of public responsibility
for provision of widely-needed and socially-desirable serv-
ices. If this had not happened, it is reasonable to contend
that the recreation movement, as an example, would have
remained close to the original concept of children’s playlots
rather than expanding to the social movement that it is
today.

With the increasing expenditure of public funds have
come planning, budgeting and management, designed to
heighten effective use of tax-funds. On the municipal level,
the real systematization of public finance and business-like
control of public funds coincides largely with the deveIOp-
ment of the city manager movement. The city manager
form of government introduced into the American political
scene the concept of nonpartisan management of the muni-
cipal enterprise. It is probably never completely possible
to remove the influence of politics and political expediency
from the administration of government; however, the scien-
tific management movement—such as the city manager
form of government represents—has done a tremendous
amount to put government administration on a professional
basis, with the accent Upon public administration skills
rather than upon the once-prevalent practices of graft, pork-
barreling and bribery.

In the preceding article of this series, on “Planning is the
business of preparing for action,” published in the January
RECREATION, we paid special attention to the purposes
and processes involved in drawing up a master plan to
guide department actions. In this article, we shall turn our
attention to budget-making and the management process.

Budget-making is characteristically a function of the
top-most executive level. It is properly concluded that the
city manager cannot be held accountable for his perform-
ance unless he has authority and responsibility in such

areas as public finance. In such a setting, the role of the
department head does not become meaningless with refer-
ence to budget-making matters. Instead, he must adapt his
appropriation application so that it contains the more pre-
cise data required when scientific management is sought.

A budget has been defined as a story of what is pro-
posed to be done, told in fiscal terms. Budget-making, then,
becomes a significant part of the administrative planning
process. Unless the monetary amounts in a budget are based
upon some tangible, previously-prepared plan which has
had the benefit of careful study, a systematic reason for
requesting appropriations is lacking. Unless there is a real-
istic plan which the department executiv'e can use in his
preparation of department requests and for reference when
he appears before the budget-making officials, his requests
are something in the nature of asking for a blank check to
pay for services which he hasn’t shown are needed or that
he is prepared to provide.

Budget practice in the past has been to request funds
for the employment of a certain personnel set-up, plus an
additional number of dollars for supplies and equipment.
Under such a method of requesting financing, it is ex-
tremely diflicult to determine precisely how the money is
to be utilized for the accomplishment of major and minor
departmental services and functions. In such instances,
there is no method of measurement which can be employed
in advance to gauge the efficiency and economy of the
contemplated method of performing the work. The more
business-like method is to set up specific projects and sup-
port them with realistic estimates of personnel and equip-
ment requirements, so that the budget is a genuine recital
of the work which the agency proposes to do.

While a barrage of exact statistics and carefully-com-
puted dollar amounts is necessary in budget-making, its
significance is not always apparent to the budget-reviewing
body or to the citizen who is interested in securing informa-
tion as to how his government works. This suggests, then,

that the budget message is the most widely-understandable
portion of the budget, and that special attention should be
given to making the message coherent and intelligible. A
well-conceived budget narrative is tied to reality. As such,
it considers the following: '

1. What was planned last year? A brief resume of im-
portant portions of the previous year’s plan, plus the
reasons for their having been scheduled, is needed to relate
subsequent portions of the narrative to the continuing pur-
poses of the agency.

2. What was accomplished last year? A digest of accom-
plishments and illustrative comment, to explain the reason
for not completing objectives, is needed.

3. What can realistically be accomplished this year?
Under this heading should be set forth the proposals for the
year as developed in the master plan, together with any
additional notes which will illuminate the proposals.

4. What needs to be done? Under this heading should
be listed the minimal obligations of the department, so that
comparisons can be made between what must be done and
what has been planned. Such items as fixed and unavoid-
able expenses should be set forth in this section.

5. How is it to be done? What additional staff will be
needed? How much are workers to be paid? What changes
in operating procedures during the coming year will result
in savings to the department?

The fiscal document itself, supported by such arithmetical
schedules as are necessary to portray how the dollar
amounts were ascertained, is a well-known part of the
budget and need not be dealt with here. A third document,
and one of considerable importance, is the department or-
ganization chart and accompanying personnel data. The
organization chart needs to be restudied at least annually
to prevent “institutionalizing” of the agency staff. Such a
restudy will assist in guiding the way to necessary person-
nel changes and adjustments, before employees have settled
into rigid operating patterns. The organization chart will
not straighten out personnel problems, but it can help to
point out where they exist. The personnel data should in—
clude a schedule of salaries for each position classification,
together with a departmental work program illustrating the
number of man hours to be allocated each principal work
division—i.e., playground supervision, maintenance, Special
program direction, staE meetings and in-service training.

Lubricating Oil

And now we turn to our final t0pic for consideration-—
the management process. The management process can best
be illustrated by comparing it to the lubricating oil in the
automobile engine. Without the oil the engine won’t run;
yet. the oil in itself doesn’t make the engine operate. So
it is in directing the activities of an organization. The
agency may be generously endowed with a corps of talented
specialists, but also needed is management skill to obtain
effective utilization of individual abilities in a coordinated
effort. We call this the management process and define it
as the special methods which are devised to satisfy the ad-
ministrative needs of a particular work problem with re-
sultant elimination of friction, duplication and waste.

FEBRUARY 1951

Utilization of the tax dollar in such a way as to insure
maximum productivity per penny spent is an understood
obligation of every public official. It is perhaps a weakness
in recreation administration that not enough attention has
been given to the process of developing measurement meth-
ods which can be used to demonstrate what work is being
done. Such measurement devices would be highly useful
to the layman who wants “to be shown”—who wants the
department executive to tally up the units of accomplish-
ment. Something more specific than attendance figures or
activity listings is necessary to demonstrate quantitatively
and qualitatively exactly what the department has been
doing.

Probably the greatest cause of waste in the use ‘of rec-
reation funds is the failure by management to utilize
adequately-available man hours. To curb this loss at the
point where it occurs, more competent understandings of
the management process are necessary, and more effective
methods of supervision must be employed.

Determination of the supervisory methods to be used de-
pends upon knowing what it is that the supervisory process
is expected to accomplish. Supervision exists to obtain the
performance of a more professionally-competent job; there-
fore, the supervisory process involves utilizing means of
measuring employee skills and deficiencies, programming
training sessions, individual counselling, stimulating an
employee’s interest in his professional growth, and em—
ploying all the other known devices for improving employee
ability.

The five elements in the management process are:

1. Planning. The determination of objectives to define
what is to be accomplished.

2. Organization. The planning and building of the per-
sonnel structure—the “machine”—that is to carry out the
planned program.

3. Policies and Procedures. This process is concerned
with the systematization of work methods, thus providing
the employees with an administrative kinship to the think-
ing of the department heads so that they are more ade-
quately prepared to follow and enhance agency policies.

4. Facilities. The employee must have certain “tools”
with which to work; they must be of a certain quality and
they must be usable. Broken slides, inadequate clubroom
space or the lack of a basketball court are all lacks or de-
ficiencies in specific program situations. Their inadequacies
handicap the employee and harm his morale by preventing
him from doing as much as he is professionally able.

5. Production Standards and Evaluation. An essential
ingredient of supervision is that it be related to production
standards and evaluative concepts which permit factual
appraisal of the employee’s performance. Without develop-
ment of suitable criteria for measuring performance, the
administrator can neither establish a level of performance
which can be viewed as the norm—which must be at least
attained by all employees—nor is he equipped to make
qualitative judgments and comparisons of the work of vari-
ous employees to determine staff strengths and weaknesses.
This topic represents what is probably one of the most

499

stimulating areas for research in recreation administration.

A Supervisory Plan

It is important to construct a supervisory plan—a notion
of what it is that the supervisory process is expected to
accomplish—and then to select and practice the methods
which are known to be most effective in the particular
situation encountered. Supervision, as a management
method, has come a long way from the primitive ideas of
overseeing, which were typical fifty years ago, to our
modern understanding of it as a cooperative activity. The
recreation movement must be recognized as a social force.
As such it becomes not a physical activity of conducting
baseball games, but an educational process in democratic
method. In this framework, supervision must take on qual-
ities and connotations far more subtle and profound than
would have been necessary in a less meaningful situation.
From this we can conclude that the supervisory process
operates within, is nourished by the democratic process.

Democracy is more than a political method, an accept-
ance of the will of the majority. Democracy emphasizes the
worth of the individual. It recognizes the existence of differ-
ences between people in many ways—intelligence, physical
skill, health, race, religious affiliation—and, yet, respects
the intrinsic and unique personal worth of the individual.
Democracy must be viewed as a continuous process of ex-
amining, questioning, sampling. It relies upon the processes
of discussion, deliberation and majority decision for its
direction, and substitutes leadership for authority. Once
recreation is viewed as functioning within this sort of
framework—this intellectual climate—the process of de-
veloping techniques of leadership and methods of super-
vision becomes pre-eminent; for unless these are determined
and utilized, the purposes remain unattained.

The understanding of supervision as a coercive process
is obsolete. In its place has come the dynamic idea of
supervision as a means of training, of counseling, of
guidance. The supervisory goal is improved agency service.
As processes in this striving, recognition is given to the
fact that each employee is a key to this accomplishment,
and that freeing and enlarging his powers of leadership
and creativity are ideals in the supervision undertaking.
Principles governing supervision include:

1. The supervisory plan should be cooperatively de-
veloped by the staE members so that the supervisory work
will be directly related to their eXpressed desires for aid.

2. Supervision must derive its direction from the situa-
tion. It is useless to deve10p a supervisory plan unless that
plan is based upon facts about the needs of the leaders and
the professional goals of the agency.

To advance the purposes of the agency, it is essential
that the agency promote the competence of the leader and
seek to help him improve his performance. Supervision
which stimulates self-directed self-improvement is the most
satisfactory kind. Stimuli which perform this function are:

1. Provision for free and open discussion of common
problems in staff meetings. This will require that the group
leader have skill in discussion leading.

2. Committee participation by leaders in planning staff

500

meetings, conferences, in-service training programs.

3. In-service training, where the leader participates with
others of similar status, as well as with higher ranking staff
members, in analyzing and evaluating performance, in fill-
ing gaps left by inadequate or inapprOpriate preliminary
training, and in professional reading and research.

4.. Leader participation (probably through committee
work) in the administrative planning process.

5. Maintenance of a good professional library at agency
expense for use by the leaders.

6. Committee inquiry into the subject matter of the field.
This may be expressed in development of objectives, ex-
perimental diagnosis of methods or materials, or organiza-
tion of a continuing effort to improve leadership methods.

In the process of organizing in-service training programs,
department heads must not require that the leaders take
courses to improve their competence and yet overlook the
possibility that the supervisors may also need additional
training. The improvement of leadership is a task of the
leader, assisted by the supervisor; stimulation in the leader
of the desire for improved abilities must be preceded by
supervisory skills capable of counselling and guidance.

The foregoing may have left a mistaken impression that
supervision is viewed exclusively as an intellectual process,
where much theory spinning and pleasant talk are sub-
stituted for the business of seeing that the required job
is being done in the demanded fashion by the persons paid
for such work. Of course, no such whimsical suggestion is
intended. But the effort made in these two articles has been
to demonstrate that good administration is a challenging
process and that waste motion, waste time and inadequate
productivity are prime areas for improved recreation ad-
ministration practices. If the playground were to be con-
sidered as a factory where the output could be counted
every day and every hour within the day, it would then
soon be possible to eliminate many unproductive practices.
Fortunately, the playground role is not restricted to a level
of activity represented by mere counting of output. But no
amount of lofty dedication can be accepted as a substitute
for honest effort. It is wrong, from a public administration
standpoint, and detrimental to the ideals of the recreation
movement, to have staff employees closeted in offices issuing
equipment, answering telephones or fraternizing with a few
friends; yet these, and many similar practices, provide the
soft underbelly which makes recreation vulnerable.

The recreation superintendent has a long overdue job of
planning to do if a detached and objective examination of
his program demonstrates that there is no coherent long-
range plan, no sound method of department budget-making
and no system to his management processes. It is far better
that the recreation personnel examine their practices and
make the necessary revisions. This results in professional
growth. If we cannot do this job for one another, then it
deserves to be taken over by those who need know nothing
more about our field than that it is a place where one can
probably effect economies by 10pping off unproductive staff
and reducing salaries to coincide with a lower grade admin-
istrative capacity.

RECREATION

HEN “CALLING” SQUARE DANCES,
Was in leading all rhythmic activ-
ities, it is essential that we know when
we are on the beat of the music. Music
is as important to the dance as back-
ground is to a picture of a beautiful
outdoor scene. If the music is suited,
one is hardly aware it is there because
it is so much a part of the dance—every
beat fitting its steps and rhythm.

Those who learn to call square
dances, and have not had training in

 

music and rhythm, need to know how
to hear the definite beats so that they
may correct themselves when they are
calling oil beat. To the musically-
trained person, calling out of time dis-
torts the beauty of both the music and
the dance.We hope that the following
will help those who are untrained to
learn to call and to know when they
are with the music.

Eight beats are used in the following
outline and, by leaving out words,

counting the beats instead, we learn to
know and to feel when it is time for
the word to be used.

Some people who are not sure of
their rhythm call with patter, using a
word for every beat; this is the easier
way. But if they could learn to call
without patter, awaiting the correct
number of beats each time between
words, they would never call off beat
and could become skilled in calling
with or without patter.

Note: If called as above, the timing
is right. There is no waiting or rushing
while dancing “Sashay Four.” This
figure is a little diflicult to call while
watching the dancers as they are mov-
ing forward when the caller calls “fall
back” and vice versa.

FEBRUARY 1951

In all rhythmic calling, the direc—
tions are given two beats preceding the
change of motion so that the dancers
will know the next movement and not
have to wait—assuring perfect timing.

If the caller would fill in the “clashes”

with words for “Sashay Four,” he

would find it easier to call; if he prac-
tices it as written, there will never be

a chance of not hearing the beat and
calling off rhythm.

Evolution of In-Service

Training in a

City Recreation Department

 

Robert E. Reed

NE or THE MOST important prob-
lems confronting today’s recrea-
tion executive is that of the in-service
training program. Adequately-trained
personnel means good leadership—and
good leadership is the backbone, the
very foundation, of modern recreation.
Just as the lifeline stretched across the
deck of a ship at sea in a storm pro-
vides guidance and safety to the sea-
man working on the pitching deck; so,
too, the in-service training program
offers to the recreation leader guidance
throughout the storm of changing polit-
ical, social and economic conditions
and safety from the sea of decadent
inactivity.

Recreation, in many respects, is an
educational process; hence, to keep
abreast of the field, you, as leader,
must be continually alert to the changes
going on about you and adapt yourself
and your profession to these changes.
The in-service training program offers
the best opportunity to evaluate these
changes in terms of the recreational
needs of your particular community
and to carry out whatever training pro-
gram is necessary to enable your staff
to meet these demands. Whether the
municipality is a large metropolitan
area or a small rural community;
whether it has long engaged in public
recreation or just recently entered the
field; whether it depends upon paid,
professional leadership or upon volun-
teer leadership, one common denomi-
nator is present—the need for a well-
planned, comprehensive, in-service

training program.
Recreation executives in many com-

‘" munities are faced with the same prob-

lems with which we have had to deal in
St. Louis; it is with this realization in
mind that a review of our own in-serv-
ice training program for the past few
years is offered. It will perhaps suggest
a possible solution to your own par-
ticular problems.

When I first took on my full-time
duties as general supervisor, eight
years ago, salaries were extremely low,

' ranging from sixty-five to one hundred

ten dollars per month. Thus we could
not expect to attract and hold many
persons with the educational back-
ground and experience demanded of
today’s recreational worker. This same
period marked the advent of civil serv-
ice for city employees and, since many
people had received their original ap-
pointments through political connec-
tions, there was a marked feeling of
unrest. With such conditions prevalent,
it became apparent that there was an
extreme need for an in-service training
program to develop our potential
strength into the well-rounded, eflicient
recreation staff that we could become
and to aid the new workers to attain
the same high level of proficiency.

As this story unfolds, you will proba-
bly note how, on some occasions, good
training standards have been somewhat
violated. But I trust that you will also
see that this was caused by the exigen-
cies of the moment. For example, I
firmly believe that staff should aid in
the planning, the organization and even
in the administration of the training pro-
gram. Staif members may realize, even
better than you, what their own indi-

vidual weaknesses.and deficiencies are,
and if you can successfully draw them
out in this respect, their assistance will
be invaluable. This, in itself, is excel-
lent training for staff workers in ad-
ministrative duties and makes them
more appreciative of the responsibili-
ties borne by the executive.

Our staff, however, had never been
asked to aid in planning a program.
They were used to doing only what they
had been told and group thinking, in-
dependent of the-central ofiice, was un- '
heard of. Thus, the very circumstances
that dictated the need of a good in-
service training program prevented our
operating under optimum training con-
ditions. So, the first task was to create
in the minds of the staff a “professional
consciousness,” an awareness of a job
to be done, to impress them with the
importance of their work to the com-
munity and to instill a feeling of pride
in a job well done.

To aid in this develoPment, a library
relating to all phases of recreation and
to allied fields was started, open at all
times to every member of the staff. New
books are added as funds permit.

We still follow our original practice
of meeting every Saturday morning
during the playground season and
every other Saturday morning during
the community center season. This is
working time for our employees and
attendance is compulsory. We have,

however, changed our format for these
meetings.

Originally, our training periods con-
sisted simply of meetings during which
the weak spots in our program were

pointed out and suggestions were of-
fered as to how they could be over-

come. From time to time, lectures per-
tinent to some part of our program
were given by the writer or his assist-
ant. Realizing the need for new ideas
from outside our department, we de-
cided to invite outstanding recreation
workers from other local agencies to
talk before our group and to encourage
our workers to attend recreational in.
stitutes held in this area. Wherever
necessary, staff members have been al-
lowed to attend these institutes during
working hours; we consider the knowl-
edge and training received of enough
importance to justify this procedure.
An attitude of acceptance of the
training program had been manifesting
itself. Casual, but careful, questioning
among members of the staff brought to
light the fact that we had several em-
ployees not only ready to accept a more
prominent role in the training program,
but eager to make their contributions.

Staff Participation Begins

Therefore, at the beginning of a new
community center season, a mimeo-
graphed outline of our training pro-
gram for the year was given to every
worker. This was complete in every
detail, listing the dates of our training
sessions and the assignments, explain-
ing what was to be covered and nam-
ing the individuals responsible for con-
ducting each session. Yes, we had
entered a new era in our training pro-
' gram—the burden of carrying the load
of staff training was shifting to the
workers themselves.

As for the content of our training
sessions, we have attempted to plan a
well-balanced program including low-
organized games and athletics, arts and
crafts, storytelling and so forth. In the
beginning, we could only hit the high
spots. As we have added new phases of
recreation to our program, we have
provided the necessary training in these
fields.

Meanwhile, the expansion of our
program made it necessary to create
supervisory positions in some activity
fields. In all cases, the supervisors came
up from the ranks—and I attribute this
largely to the success of our training
program!

We were so encouraged by the re-
sults shown during the first year the
plan was in Operation, and individual

FEBRUARY 1951

staff members handled their assign-
ments so well, that another forward
step was initiated at the end of the sea-
son. A committee of staff members,
including one activity supervisor, was
appointed to plan a suggested training
program for the following (1948-1949)
indoor season, paying particular atten-
tion to the possibility of getting more
staff participation as instructors. I met
with the committee on only two occa-
sions and then only to answer certain
questions on policy and procedure.

After a few weeks of diligent work,
the committee reported back to the
entire department. It had realistically
attacked our programs, methods and
policies and had thoroughly covered
our department and its work. It ended
its report with a number of suggestions
to the office, chief of which, insofar as
training was concerned, was one that
noted that subjects assigned through-
out the year should be covered by panel
discussions rather than by individual
lecture assignments. We had a number
of volunteers and the various panels
were then filled out by assignment from
the office. All this from a stag that just
a short time back could find nothing to
suggest! This proved to our satisfac-
tion that better results are obtained
when the staff shares in the planning
and execution of the program, feeling
more an integral part of it, than when
all arrangements are handled by the
central office.

This experiment, although successful,
also had its shortcomings. In reviewing
our program to date, we found staff
members who, for various reasons, had
never appeared before our group. The
new committee, composed of all who
wished to volunteer their services, rec-
ommended that we continue the same
type of discussion periods. To guaran-
tee the appearance of every staff mem-
ber, ten group projects were selected
and each of our ten community staffs
was assigned to one of them. Each staff
member was given a particular portion
of the project to develop and report
upon to the group.

All this activity required our work-
ers to engage in a great deal of re-
search in the various recreation publi-
cations available in our office or in the
public libraries, increasing their knowl-
edge in several phases of our program.

It also presented the opportunity for
experience in public speaking before a
sympathetic audience and good train-
ing in acquiring the poise and ability
demanded by it.

During this year, we also used visual
aids for the first and, so far, only time.
Our entire staff, with its supplement
of summer playground workers, was
shown the films, “Playtown, U. S. A.”
and “31,000 for Recreation.” Our
supervisory staff saw several films per-
taining to the right and wrong types of
employee relationships. In addition,
we sponsored basketball and volleyball
clinics for players, coaches and officials,
using not only qualified members of
our own staff, but also outstanding
high school and “Y” coaches and of-
ficials.

The next year, the 1949-50 season,
saw more radical innovations as every
effort was made to bring to our staff
the type of training most urgently
needed at the time. We decided to pat-
tern our training along the lines of
courses offered in the universities. Sev-
eral staff members were assigned the
job of outlining courses of study, which
I later edited. The courses finally ap-
proved and selected by the group were:
Organization and Administration of
Recreation, Administering a Commu-
nity Sports Program, Dancing, Public
Relations, Music, Crafts and Camping.
Individuals were assigned to serve as
instructors for these sessions.

One of the highlights was the practi-
cal application of the lesson dealing
with window trimming in the course on
public relations. Each of our centers
obtained window display space at a
well-known business establishment in
its own community, and a well-planned
recreation exhibit was held simulta-
neously for a week’s time. This was
sound public relations and did a great
deal to advertise our work.

The department also sponsored a
course in social recreation activities,
offered by the University of Missouri
for two hours’ undergraduate credit.
While the course was open to anyone,
members of our staff were the only ones
who availed themselves of this oppor-
tunity.

To increase the scope of our social
recreation training, each community
center staff was assigned to prepare a

503

party for one meeting period through-
out the year. Good training in develop-
ing party ideas, planning and prepar-
ing party menus and arranging a pro-
gram of party activities was obtained
through this means. We discovered
much heretofore hidden talent among
our staff and the parties were huge
successes socially.

Since the inception of our training
program, we had held a one-day pre-
season training period on the Satur-
day immediately preceding the open-
ing of our playgrounds. Our employees
were on the payroll during the train-
ing period. Three years ago we in-
creased this preseason training period
to two and one-half days; yet I had
never been wholly satisfied with the
arrangements. Because of outside in-
terests and attractions, we hadn’t been
able to keep the attention of our group
concentrated upon the training pro-
gram. Our summer workers had just
finished a year of schooling, climaxed
by a series of final examinations. They
were tired of studying, restless and
wanted to relax and enjoy themselves.
Thus, psychologically, they were not
ready for a training program.

The Program Moves to Camp

After much deliberation, I thought
that I had the answer to this problem.
Why not offer our staff an environment
that was at once restful and enjoyable
and yet free from the extraneous tempta-
tions which were bedeviling our pres-
ent program? IVas such a thing pos-
sible? Yes, I believed that it was and
certain that our playground training
program would be more successful in

calnp because the camping situation is
more conducive to good training pro-
cedures. The staff would be under our
control from the time we entered camp
until we departed for home. There
would be no impatience to get away
for dinner or for a date at the movies.
They wouldn’t be plagued by the staid
traditions of confinement to a class-
room—an experience from which they
had just been released.

So, with the advent of our two-and-
a-half-day preseason training program,
it was suggested that this training be
conducted at a camp. But, for various
reasons, this was
turned down, not only then, but for the

recommendation

next two years. However, this past year
the story was different. Conditions had
changed and the new administration
saw fit to approve the suggestion. Our
1950 preseason playground training
program was held on June 16, 17 and
18 at Camp Don Bosco. *'

In order to evaluate accurately the
results of this training program, our
entire staff was given a questionnaire
designed to bring out both the good
and the bad features as viewed by the
workers themselves. Space was pro-
vided for suggestions for future plan-
ning. In an attempt to secure honest
criticism, the questionnaires were re-
turned without identification of any
kind.

It was most encouraging to find a
four-and-a-half-to-one majority in favor
of this type of training program, and
a number of good suggestions was
made by our staff for future considera-
tion. This corroborated the opinion of
the central office staff, gained from ob-

servation while in camp, and more than
justified our expectations for the ex-
periment.

The success of our training program
as a whole has been evident in many
ways; but most gratifying is the fact
that other agencies have recognized the
advance we have made. Several of our
staff members have appeared on con-
ference programs offered by other
agencies. For example, our staff han-
dled the entire crafts program at last
year’s annual Sherwood Forest Camp
Training Conference; three of us were
on the program of the first statewide
community park and recreation insti-
tute offered by the University of Mis-
souri last April. We have had workers
on other programs, too, such as those
of the Midwest Recreation Executives
Conference, other area conferences, the
National Recreation Congress and on
study committees of the Group Work
and Recreation Division of the Social
Planning Council of St. Louis.

Our own staff is becoming more and
more interested in attending these
events. At the National Recreation As-
sociation’s 1949 Congress in New
Orleans, for example, St. Louis led all
other cities in the number of delegates
registered—and virtually all of these
were members of our staff! As their
knowledge increases, the need for con-
tinued training also becomes apparent
and the value of these conferences and
institutes is realized. Altogether, we feel
that we have come \a long way since
our training program was inaugurated
back in 1943, and our success encour-
ages us to look ahead to the future for

even better results.

Jean Paul

the
ELDERLY

and
FRIENDSHIP

66 LACES PLEASE,” came the call of the director. With

this, two elderly ladies adjusted their skirts and
gingerly climbed the steps leading to the stage. Then the
piano swung into the introduction. But what was this? Cer-
tainly not a stately minuetl N0, these dignified-looking
ladies were getting the beat to a tune that their grandchil-
_ dren would term “quite jivey.” Came the cue, and then
glory be, with skirts and grey hair Hying, they broke into
a tap dance! It was a rehearsal for the Edmonton (Canada)
Friendship Club’s April variety show, “The Three Score Re-
view.” Oh, there would be minuets, too, and songs and skits
and everything else that go to make up such a presenta-
tion. And nearly every performiar would be over the age
of sixty!

Now going into its second year of successful activity,
the club was started with the object of supplying compan-
ionship to a few lonely, elderly men and women. Within a
year, however, there were nearly five hundred members and
a long waiting list of people in the sunset of life, all craving
the one priceless thing that this club had to offer—release
from loneliness through friendship. Before their association
with the club, many of these elderly folk had not, for years,
really known the joy of having a friend.

Here’s how it all began: Sparked by Eve Henderson, bet-
ter known to Edmontonians as Helen Kent, women’s radio
commentator and herself a vivacious grandmother, a meet-
ing was held early last year to which representatives from
about thirty women’s clubs and a representative of the rec-
reation commission were invited. At this meeting, welfare
workers outlined the need for a recreational and social

FEBRUARY 195 1

 

center for elderly men and women. The recreation com-
mission representative spoke of recreation as being a need
for all age groups including the elderly. Attention was
drawn to the many elderly folk seen daily in the lobbies of
stores and hotels, seeking nothing more than the warmth
of companionship.

After several more meetings, plans were drawn up to
stage a party for several hundred elderly folk whose names
and addresses were obtained through churches, welfare
agencies and other sources. On each invitation was written
the name of a hostess who was responsible for about six
men and women during the evening. It was her duty to
make these people feel at home, to chat with them and thus
discover their interests as a basis for building up a club
program. Later in the evening, when the elderly guests had
warmed to the music, singing and dancing, they were ap-
proached on the subject of a club where they could enjoy
handcrafts, cards and, most important, companionship.
Their approval was unanimous.

After much discussion, the name “Friendship Club” was
chosen by potential members themselves. Such a name
seemed to symbolize what they now wanted most out of life.
It was they, too, who set down the rules for their club.
They outlined the object of the club as follows: “To pro-
mote, foster and provide friendship amongst elderly per-
sons through recreation and leisure-time pursuits.”

Restrictions are few, but show much thought and good
sense on the part of the elderly people. Applicants must be
residents of Edmonton or the Edmonton district. There
are no restrictions as to religion, race or color because,

50:

after all, loneliness knows no such boundaries. Members
must be sixtv years of age or over (the oldest is a spry
eighty-six) except in cases of blindness, amputation or
other such handicaps which may prevent such persons from
participating in more vigorous activities. No fees are col-
lected, but a contribution box is maintained for small dona-
tions from those who can afford it. With knowing wisdom,
the elderly folk also stipulated that “No political or reli-
gious controversial matters are to be discussed that would
tend to create discord.”

A board of directors was set up with representatives from
the women’s clubs who had shown a desire to help. Now,
more and more clubs are actually clamoring for the oppor-
tunity to provide entertainment and refreshments at the
meetings. The Edmonton Recreation Commission gave a
large, bright airy room for club use three afternoons and
one evening a week. Press and radio were caught in the
tide and came forward with marvelous publicity, with the
result that donations of dishes, kitchen utensils, cardtables
and other requisites soon began pouring in from both com-
mercial and private interests. Enthusiasm mounted with
each meeting. Members brought their friends who, in turn,
brought their friends until, finally, membership edged the
five hundred mark. Facilities were strongly overtaxed, and
much to the disappointment of all, this central Friendship
Club had to refuse further membership.

Since then, however, a branch club has been formed in
the Alberta Avenue district, sponsored by women’s organi-
zations of that district and under the direct jurisdiction of
the central board. It is hoped that other Edmonton com-
munities will follow this lead and thus enable elderly folk
to attend a club in their own district and save the long and,
for many of them, costly trip downtown.

Here is an example of complete democracy. Some mem-
bers are living alone in one room on as little as thirty-five
dollars a month, paying as much as half of that for rent.
To them, the carfare required for their visits to Friendship
Club meetings is a comparatively large allotment from
their meager budgets. On the other hand, some are wealthy,
and their need for companionship brings them to club
meetings by taxi from Edmonton’s richest district.

These elderly folk aren’t just sitting back, accepting all
the advantages of the Friendship Club and enjOying it as a
special consideration for their age, as they might justly
expect to do. They have entered completely into the spirit
of the thing, learning from volunteer teachers new crafts
such as pottery, flower-making, weaving, rug-making, bas-
ketry and leatherwork. Finished products, many of them
so beautiful that they have surprised even the folk who
make them, have been displayed and sold, thus augmenting
the treasury. Guiding light of the handcrafts department
is a former therapist, Mrs. C. Emslie, who has become a
mother confessor and comforter, and can call most of her
“pupils” by name. She now has two assistants, and all
three are kept busy solving the problems encountered by
not-so-nimble fingers in the weaving of a basket or fash-
ioning of a wallet. At the beginning, many of the elderly
men, too’, evinced an interest in the handcrafts, but gradu-
ally forsook this for the cardtables. There may be better

506

bridge played, but none chattier or happier than at .Friend-
ship Club sessions.

Explaining her role in the club, Mrs. Emslie looked
fondly at the grey heads bent earnestly over their hand-
craft projects, listened for a minute to the buzz of friendly
chatter and remarked, “On the first day that I approached
these folks about handcrafts, frankly, I didn’t know what
to think. Some of them complained of their arthritis;
others were worried about their eyesight; and many of
them were just too shy to say anything. But after they had
completed their first article, they just couldn’t wait to get
started on the second, and they’ve been like that ever since.”
Mrs. Emslie is now attached to the recreation commission
staff.

Last fall, the Friendship Club sponsored a fashion show,
the clothes being provided by a large department store, and
a good sum of money was raised. The elderly people also
held a Gay Nineties fashion show for their own members.
Beautiful heirlooms were tenderly unpacked and worn with
great pride. Later came a Halloween masquerade, a grand
and gay affair involving much giggling and secrecy among
members who had been too busy through the years sending
their small fry off to such parties to take time out for such
frivolity themselves. And oh, how they loved it! Came
Christmas, and another excuse for a party. So they staged
an evening complete with not one, but two Santas, and a
Mrs. Santa Claus as well. March brought the first anni-
versary party, another gay affair that had members agog
for weeks. As soon as these folks get one such party planned
and carried through to a successful conclusion, they im-
mediately start planning another one. They just haven’t
time to be lonely!

Those who have guided the Friendship Club since its
inception have been encouraged by the response of the
elderly men and women; touched to see blind people being
led to the stage to sing for the other members; delighted
to see the once shy ones now the life of the party; and
amused to see ones who could only be described as “crotch-
ety” now good-naturedly kidding their fellow members.

The psychological effect has been tremendous, for the so-
called ills of old age are forgotten as members enjoy the
fun of belonging, in being a part of the community-at-large,
and in doing things for themselves. It is difficult to ascer-
tain the potentialities of this club as the spirit and fellow-
ship which prevail among members are capable of achieving
all of their aims.

Says Eve Henderson, the club’s originator, “It would be
wonderful if friendship clubs could be formed in this man-
ner right across our country. It would be a dream come
true, for what can be done here in Edmonton can be done
in any city. Look around, you’ll find many elderly folk
right in your own community and, with your help, they too
can enjoy joyful, friendly companionship. The Friendship
Club of Edmonton is proving what can be done through
cooperation. It has caught the imagination of all citizens;
it will catch yours wherever you live. Let us not forget
those who pioneered and made this country of ours the
wonderful place it is. They deserve our consideration.
Let’s give it freely and lovingly.”

selecting

Community Leaders

HE INVITATION to consider this topic implied that the

leaders under discussion were to be those on welfare,
civic and cultural boards, not those connected with business
or governmental administrations. Boards, as a device for
overseeing and inspiring social action in this country, have
, shouldered mountains of responsibility.

With the described limits, then, how does the selection of
leaders for service upon these boards begin? The first point
to note is that leaders are not selected—they emerge. And
when they have emerged, what one does is rather to cope
with, than to select among, them.

A board has a new member to find, an office to fill.
Among all those concerned, the professional executive has
the highest stake in the risk of this search. His work can
reach no higher point than his board is able to envision.

Let’s draw a picture of the ideal board member. He
should be dynamic, forceful, informed about, or at least
concerned about, the field with which the board is dealing;
he should have prestige in the community in general and
yet have time to give to the board’s work; he should be a
hospitable creature who, when the leader in the profes-
sional worker’s special interest comes to town, will invite
him to dinner. So much for the ideal———you end by taking
what you can get, and the wonderful thing is that so often
what you can get turns out so well. For it is seldom that,
in the beginning, the new board member is well-informed
in the field of the board’s activities; he often has to be
educated even to be concerned.

Of course, if the board is very sinful, it will get for its
sins one member who feels that he is doing somebody a
great favor by serving upon it. Who the mythical creature
is who is being favored is an impenetrable secret, but his
benefactor bobs up over and over again.

Board members who are dynamic, forceful and dripping
with prestige are acquired in number; but the one with

board of directors of the National Recreation Association.

Community Service of Omaha, Nebraska.

time for the board’s work—where is he? He is as scarce
as the heath hen and as shy when found and, as in the case
of the heath hen, no one knows whether he is reproducing
himself or not.

There, with all their faults and lacks, you see the mate-
rial out of which board members are made. But to save the
picture, you have in the background the professional worker
or staff of workers. Whenever I watch the pro operating
on his board, I think of the sculptor and his unpromising
clay and the resulting heroic figure. It does seem unjust
that, in addition to carrying on his profession, the executive
director has to shape his governing body; but that is what
he must do. And it is done, as a rule, in such good spirit
that it must be one of the courses of training that has to be
excelled in before the college degree is given.

Having been the raw material that a pleasing variety of
these skillful professionals have worked upon, I can describe
their several routines. Usually they begin by assuming that
I know nothing of the field and so they educate me—they
see that I have magazines of information upon their spe-
cialty; they lure me into going to conferences; they keep me
busy with projects. In some fields, markedly in musical en-
terprises and welfare, they have found me so hopelessly inept
that they have guided the board into dropping me before
my term of service could have ended. Those people I do
admire. Time is So scarce that the bare rules of economy
direct that it should not be wasted upon the unsuited per-
son. This leads us to Axiom I in the care and nurture of
board members:

Meritorious service upon one board does not guarantee a
member’s similar success upon another kind of board. It is
unlikely that a person who has to be coaxed to come upon a
board will be worth the trouble it costs to educate him.

To guide the policy of the institution the board governs
is the major- work of the board member, of course. But
almost as important is the task of enlightening the commu-
nity in general as to the goal of the institution and its suc-
cess in reaching that goal. A reluctant member, no matter

507

how outstanding in other endeavors, is not likely to do a
good interpretation job.

A board would do well, I believe, to avoid those who are
obvious leaders in the community. For one thing, they are
entangled with so many projects that their enthusiasms get
mixed and it could be your institution that has to suffer to
build up the interests of some unrelated project. A eon-
certed analysis by many minds is what most programs
thrive on—and you get that better from a membership
which lacks that prilna donna attitude which eventually af-
flicts those known as “born leaders”! At a recreation con-
ference this last spring, I noticed at a session concerned
with board members, but attended mostly by professional
workers, that the question of what to do about the domi-
neering board member took up a great deal of time. The
solution arrived at was to limit service to one term and not
to have that term too long.

It must be admitted that there are times when the avowed
leader has no substitute; that is, when the dramatic moment
comes—the campaign, the drive. At that instant, to have
someone who does not have to be explained to the commu-
nity, whose introductions have been made years before,
whose character and whose aims in the world are self-evi-
dent is better than having a large campaign fund.

Of course, as I said at the beginning, you cannot really
guard against too many leaders on your board because they
crop up where you do not expect them. Several of them at
a time are hard on everybody; but you can always comfort

yourselves with the thought that they do give vivacity to
the meetings.

In the interest of putting some concrete help into this
talk, I have been investigating what has always seemed to
me the most popular board in town. Its members never
want to leave it and they bring its work into conversations
that start far afield from it. I have never been upon it and
never shall be because its sc0pe is welfare, where I fail. The
members tell me that its meetings are lively and not long.
The material it deals with is dramatic, and the professional
workers never veil the drama. While the technical language
of the profession appears in the written reports, at the
meetings people are people and never case loads. It is non-
sectarian, but it does keep God in the board meeting.

To go back to picking our subject to pieces—selecting
community leaders on the basis of merit—what I am try-
ing to convince you of is that:

a. Leaders are not selected; they happen to you.

b. It is not certain that you can guard against them
because they do seep in.

c. You cannot be SHre of merit in a board member until
you have tried him, because merit does not operate uni-
formly in all fields.

d. You are not at the mercy of fate so long as your pro-
fessional staff keeps its skill, or I should say skills—since
they must be educators, mentors and inspirations.

In my personality of raw material, I do thank you who
are professional and ask you not to grow discouraged.

CHALLENGING

OVER THE YEARS, the annual reports of the president of

the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners have
contained thoughtful and challenging statements which have
been read with profit by park and recreation leaders. Presi-
dent Paul C. Johnson’s report for 1949 is no exception and
it strikes an optimistic, forward-looking note. At the same
time that he recognizes the serious difficulties faced by the
board in financing the city’s expanding park system, he
adds: “But I wish to point out that the situation is not un-
precedented, that it is not hopeless and that some progress
is being made.”

He continues: “I suppose that in the sixty-seven years’
history of this board, its activities were inadequately
financed for more than half of those years. Most of the time
it has had serious financial problems; yet there has never
been a year when the board’s service to the public has not
brought health and happiness to countless thousands. The
sand on our beaches may need replenishing; acres of lawn
may be worn out; walks, curbs, roadways and buildings
may be the worse for years of use-—but that which is gone
has been used up in the building of a fine generation of
people. W’e may deplore the fact that the neighborhood
playfield which, only yesterday, was new and in perfect con-
dition, is now the worse for wear, but we may also rejoice
that it has arrived at that state through the constant day-

508

STATEMENTS

to-day pounding of many feet in the pursuit of health and
happiness. Our park and recreation system was built to be
used and, since it is used so extensively, it has had, and
still is having, a great influence upon the character of its
people and upon the worth of this city. Thus the work of
the board may be termed a successful accomplishment. It is
small wonder that people should want more of so good a
thing.

“Our inability to meet the demands for an increased
recreation service is a little frustrating to us. Even before
we have provided a uniform service to all parts of the city
at a standard that is nationally accepted, we are confronted
with requests for small playlots either to be established or
equipped much closer to each other than we have con-
sidered feasible to finance. The theme seems to be ‘If play-
fields a mile apart are good, why not have playlots closer
to the small tots?’ This is strong evidence that the present
generation of parents is fully aware of the benefits of active
recreation. The children of yesterday are the parents of
today, and we are now face to face with the fruits of yes-
terday’s experiences. If we believe in our public service,
we should rejoice that its value is so generally recognized.
And it is in the recognition of this fact that I see hope in
ultimately raising the annual budget to meet reasonably
these new demands.”

r I 11-13 WORD “RAIN” has small con-

notation to most of us in our day-
to-day lives. But to recreation leaders,
the word packs dynamite. To those in
organized camping, it carries notes of
horror.

We had thirteen straight days of
Blue Ridge wind, thunder and storm
at camp last summer. We have experi-
enced more and less—but as every per-
son in camping knows, you never get
through such a period without a new
idea, a new program slant or twist.
What war has been to American tech-
nology, so rain is to camping.

During rainy weather, our recreation
hall is a busy place. Let’s take a look.
Our attention lights upon the many
checker games in progress in the middle
of the floor. Overlooking the fact that
these, at the moment, are seriously af-
fecting the success of a shuffleboard
tourney, we wonder if one could invent
a game played by four persons, using
the equipment for checkers. If so, twice
as many campers could be kept occupied
with the same amount of materials.

What would be the characteristics
of such a game? First, there would
have to be some way of telling the four
sides apart. Our campers” checker sets
have discs of two colors, made by saw-
ing up dowel rods and square stock.
We do not wish to complicate this
manufacture and, yet, prefer that our
campers play our game with their own
sets. An ideal Two sides can use single
checkers; the other two, double ones—
one checker on top of another, similar
to “kings.”

a Problem!

Quick mental manipulation of the
pieces shows that there will be four
“men” to a side. These are placed so
that the four squares which are the
corner squares of the board are each
occupied by a piece from a different
side. We place the three remaining
pieces of each side upon the three
squares surrounding the corner square
occupied by that side.

Checkers move forward only. Our
men must be more mobile to attack an
enemy on three sides. A three-way
movement would probably lead to com-
plexities beyond our invention skill;
therefore, we decide upon a chess-like
four-way, or symmetrical, movement.
Concluding that one thing is about as
good as another here, each piece can
move one square diagonally in either
direction or two squares in rows or
columns—that is, up, down or across.
We arbitrarily rule a chess-like capture,
not a jump, on the two-square move
only and let the piece jump over an
occupied square only on a capture.
The jumped piece is not captured. The
captured piece is the one occupying
the square into which the capturing
piece moves. The winner of the game
is the person with the last piece upon
the board.

Now we proceed to play, thinking
that we have hit upon a rather simple
game which should, nevertheless, be en-
tertaining. We are startled to find that
no one makes a capture after many
moves. Soon it is obvious that in order
to get within capturing distance, we
must put ourselves within the capturing
distance of the enemy. The best we can
do is to force a trade of pieces which
gets us nowhere. We have naively failed
to recognize a characteristic essential

George Thompson

to chess and checkers as games: there
exist pieces of different power and cap-
turing range or ability. The lower try
to worry the higher, while the latter are
essential to the capture of the lower.

We try to give our pieces a hierarchy
and are immediately stumped—there’s
no way of telling one piece from
another. Our pieces have very neatly
been distributed from the checker set
into four to a side and we do not wish
to make markings on the equipment.

Then, a happy thought! In the early
part of checkers, all “men’; are equal,
yet there is violence and death. The
double jump is responsible. Here is
the chance for real tactics. So we play
our game allowing a double jump. and
making the capture imperative. Things
go fairly well.

We’ve managed to invent a pleasant
game for our younger campers, but feel
that our seniors will rightly prefer the
two-sided traditional duels.

However, we continue experimenting,
solving each problem as it arises, until
we find that we at last have provided
real conflict. A few rules, routine mat-
ters to any game, are added and the
project is completed.

Now what have we learned? Several
observations can be brought to light.

First, conflict is the keynote of a
game. We have conflict only when one
side has an advantage; equal powers
meet in stalemates. However, to be fair,
each side must be of equal power at
the start of the game. This power is dis-
tributed in units. If the units within a
side are unequal, combinations of units
by opposing sides may meet and their
combined powers be unequal in the im-
mediate situation. The result is conflict.
Or, if all units are equal, there must be

RECREATION

i

other conditions which give one side
an advantage in one situation, the other
side an advantage in another.

Second, old stand-bys in recreation
materials may be varied and altered
to create something new. Principles of
traditional time-tried games should not
be overlooked in searching for new

methods.

Third, though a problem may seem
trivial, and its solution more involved
than the need warrants, the experience
of uncovering principles disclosed by
the thought process may be many times
the value of the immediate solution.

Fourth, and most important in prob-
lem solving, we need a system and pa-
tience. We should (1) analyze the prob-
lem, define the needs and note neces-
sary requirements of the solution; (2)
proceed toward a solution by attacking
the needs step by step; (3) experiment
with the solution; (4) note inadequa-
cies; (5) attack these inadequacies
with the previous steps, drawing from
other similar problems and solutions.
Here is a summary of the rules of our
game. We hope that the following game
will prove helpful to some, but that the
problem-solving experience will be
more helpful to all, since recreation it-
self is fundamentally a problem-solving
activity.

Rules for “Croats”

1. Equipment: A set of twenty-four
checkers, twelve of each color. A check-

erboard of sixty-four squares.

2. The'Croats: Each side has four
pieces or Croats. There are four sides.
The checkers are distributed among the
sides as follows: (1) four red checkers,
(2) four black checkers, (3) eight red
checkers stacked in pairs; each pair is
one Croat, (4) eight black checkers,
also stacked one upon the other in
pairs. Each pair is one Croat. Notice
that two sides are each made up of
Croats which look like kings in cheek-
ers. However, these double pieces are
equal in every respect to the single
pieces. Their purpose as double pieces
is identification alone.

3. Placement: Each player takes a
corner of the board. He places his
Croats in the four squares in his cor-

ner. His extreme corner square is

FEBRUARY 1 95 1

known as his “home square.” Thus, his
pieces at the beginning of the game
occupy his home square and the three
squares adjacent to it.

4. The moves: All Croats are equal.
Each may take any one of the following
moves:

a. From its own square to any one
of the four adjacent squares of the same
color. (Diagonally one square in any
direction.)

b. From the square it is in horizon-
tally or vertically two squares. (Two
squares up, down or across.)

c. Only when the row or column is
not occupied by another Croat, may a
piece occupying the row or column
move to a square at the edge of the
board in that row or column.

5. The capture: Captures are made
by moving onto a square occupied by
the opponent piece, not by jumping
over. These rules govern the capture:

a. Captures are made only by move
“b” above.

b. When capturing, and only when

capturing, a Croat may jump over.

another Croat of the same or opposing
side. The jumped piece is not captured.

0. The captured piece is placed upon
the home square of the side to which
it belongs, except when the home
square is occupied.

d. When the home square is oc-
cupied, captured pieces are removed

. from the board.

e. When a player’s home square is
occupied by an enemy Croat, all of that
player’s Croats are.removed from the
board, and his side is eliminated from
the game.

f. When a capture is available to a
player, he must make the capture or
lose the piece. When there is a choice
of capture, he must make the capture
that was first available.

6. The play: Players take turns,
clockwise around the board. At each
turn, a player moves one Croat, using
any one of the three moves or the cap-
ture. He may move a different Croat
and/ or use a different move at his next
turn. Should all his pieces be blocked
so that he can make no move when his
turn comes up, he loses his turn but is
not out of the game. He makes a move
at his next opportunity. A player must

make a move if it is possible for him
to do so; he cannot “pass.”

7. The winner: The person whose
Croats, or Croat, remain on the board
after all the other three sides have been
eliminated is the winner.

8. The draw: At such a time when
players cannot make a move or cap-
ture in their regular turn, the game is
declared a draw among those players
still in the game.

9. Partners: Players may agree at the
start of the game to have partners who
defend opposite corners of the board
and use the same color Croats. All
rules apply except that a player cannot
capture his partner’s Croat. The win-
ning partnership is the one in which
the winner, as described in rule num-
ber seven, has participated. When two
players have eliminated both players of
the opposition, but are themselves both
in the game, they may continue to
play against one another, according to
an agreement which must have been
reached before the start of the game.

Reeenmlendetiens free] the White House Conference

MONO RECOMMENDATIONS which were passed unani-
mously at the Midcentury White House Conference
on Children and Youth, in Washington, on December 18,

were the following:

0 That the citizens of every community accept responsi-
bility for providing and sustaining adequate programs and
facilities with professional personnel for education, health,
recreation and social services. In the development of such
programs, full and appropriate use should be made of all

voluntary and public resources.

0 That development of new housing facilities give special
attention to health, recreational and social needs; to the
extent that private industry does not provide suitable hous-
ing for low-income families, that such housing continue to

be developed by governmental agencies.

0 That more emphasis be placed upon the effects of recre-
ational activities on the personality of the individual and,
that in all neighborhoods where children and youth reside,
there should be provided recreation centers under profes-
sional and voluntary supervision.

0 That youth have an equal chance with adults to partici-
pate in the planning, and carrying out, of recreational ac-
tivities, and that, as a practical aid for such planning, states
be encouraged to study and establish official state boards
of recreation to provide counsel and information assistance
in recreation matters to communities, particularly small
towns and rural areas.

0 That all professions dealing with children have, as an
integral part of the preparation, a core of common experi-
ences on fundamental concepts of human behavior—includ-
ing the need to consider the total person as well as any
specific disorder; the interrelationship or physical, men-
tal, social, religious and cultural forces; the importance of
interpersonal relationships; the role of self-imderstanding;
and emphasis upon the positive recognition and production
of health personalities and the treatment of variations; and
that lay people be oriented through formal or informal
education to an understanding of the importance of the
foregoing concepts.

0 That an inquiring attitude be maintained toward all
services, with appropriate provision, at all levels, for con-
tinuous scientific study of needs, objectives, alternative
methods and effectiveness of programs.

0 That community groups and community leaders re-ex-
amine their attitudes and procedures in the light of the

514

findings of this conference, and make appropriate adapta- I
tions and changes.

0 That'there should be broad-based participation of all
groups without discrimination as to age, sex, race, creed,
national origin or economic levels.

0 That greater emphasis be placed, by the various profes-
sions, upon utilizing methods and seeking new means of
bringing the parents into participation in thinking and 1
planning with, and for, their children.

0 That professional workers should be trained in such a
way that they will have an understanding of, and respect 1
for, other professional skills in order that they may work
together to further community growth. Some of the ways
in which this might be achieved include:

A. In all levels of undergraduate education, that students I
receive broad preparation in. the knowledge of human .
growth behavior and motivation, which ought to be com- "
mon knowledge for them. This would also serve as a back-
ground for professional education.

B. In schools preparing for professional work, that there
be included in the curriculum—both through the classroom
and field experiences—~opportunities for cooperative work '
as problems common to all professional interests.

C. That the practicing professional worker further his
training by seeking, utilizing and promoting opportunities
to relate to, and participate with, other professional and
citizens groups in resolving problems of the individual and
the community.

D. That orientation programs be planned for all profes-
sional persons and interprofessional groups in the com-
munity.

0 That all interested groups should work in partnership to
recruit, train and use volunteer leaders for community pro-
grams, with special attention given to the utilization of
young people in appropriate ways.

° That since citizen participation is essential for effective
community services for children and youth, when not Q
already provided, citizen advisory boards and similar
groups representative of the community should be estab-

'lished for public services, as well as for private, and that

every effort should be made to enable and secure partici-
pation by a cross section of the citizenry. That educational
institutions and other groups emphasize the importance of
participation by volunteers as a basic factor in citizen re-
sponsibility.

Father Ramacher

HE FIVE HUNDRED citizens of the
T small town of Sartell, Minnesota,
swelled with pride because they knew
that they had helped to give their com-
munity something worthwhile. The
newspaper of a nearby town estimated
that fifteen thousand persons jammed
into town on Sunday, February 19,
1950, to participate in the dedication
of an $18,000 recreation center. Celeb-
rities, including Governor Luther
Youngdahl and Cedric Adams, colum-
nist of the Minneapolis Star, were there
to make speeches and lend a special
atmosphere to the occasion.

It was a big day for the community.
Every inhabitant had something to do
with the dedication—helping at the din-
ner, participating in the sports, attend-
ing the programs. There was a general
feeling of satisfaction and accomplish-
ment in the air. They now had a rec-
reation center—with skiing, skating,
tobogganing, roller skating—that every
adult and child could use; something
that Sartell had needed for years but
just had never deve10ped.

Behind this project, this dream come
true, there were the ideals, inspirations

there a few months when he started
working towards what he hOped would

organized committees, pushed money-
raising measures and helped arouse in-

much planning. He knew what he was
doing when he undertook this project;
four years ago, he had recognized a
similar recreation need in Little Falls,
Minnesota, a community of about seven
thousand citizens, and with only ideas
and ambitions he had started, as a
small parish project, what is now well-
known as Winter Wonderland.

With this project, which has since he-
come incorporated by the community,
Father Ramacher had set up an exam-
ple of what could be done by a commu-
nity; and he wanted it to be the be-
ginning of many such recreation cen-
ters.

When he arrived in Sartell, however,
he looked at the idea of establishing a
winter program with a different per-
spective. There was, of course, the
same need for recreation for the young
pe0ple. Sartell is built along both sides

of the Mississippi River, with the main
industry a large paper mill. There is
one other industry—a mill equipment
manufacturing company. The usual
stores—grocery, post ofiice, filling sta-
tions, taverns and a night club—left
much to be desired for youthful enter-
tainment.

But Father Ramacher saw beyond
these places and looked instead to the
land. There was plenty of it. He
thought that the creek which flowed
through a large, unoccupied space of
land on its way to the river might be
good for skating and swimming; the
hills to the side of the creek would be
excellent for skiing and tobogganing.

He took direct action to interest the
people of this small community in a
recreation center, more vast and excit-
ing than the one in Little Falls. A
meeting was called to organize a plan
under a board of directors. Open to
everyone, it could be considered a suc-
cess—about fifty people attended.

Such an initial meeting, Father Ra-
macher has said, is often the most dis-
appointing part of a new project, be-
cause when people are approached with
a request for several thousand dollars,
or are even asked to consider such a
plan, it usually is quite a shock. That

kind of money—well, from where is it
going to come? The people certainly
don’t have it. But he showed them
what it could mean to their town, to
their children and to themselves. And
he almost made it seem easy!

Everyone at that first meeting was
made a member of the board of direc-
tors. They were the ones, after all, who
had shown enough interest to start the
plan under way. They had shown some
faith in it; and they had undertaken
a mighty big job. On September 28,
1949, the work began.

Winter was approaching, so the ob-
vious place to start was with a skating
rink. The creek in its natural run did
not seem to provide the right place for
a rink—it was too narrow. Therefore,
a special rink was built to one side of
the creek, right at the foot of one of
the hills. This required a great deal
of manpower, but it was up to the peo-
ple to do the work if they wanted a
recreation center. At times they re-
sponded well to calls for help; at other
times they had to be asked or coaxed;
but the work progressed. Snow was
piled around the rink’s edge, packed
down, and the rink was flooded many
times to make it right for even the fin-
est skaters.

A big quonset but, one hundred
twenty feet by forty feet, was put up on
t0p of the hill overlooking the skating
rink. Big plans were scheduled for-that

516

building. Sartell has a village hall, but
here was to be a more compact, more
inviting place for shows, local produc-
tions, other entertainment and, really
important to the children and young
people, for roller skating.

Plans were taking shape; interest
had grown remarkably. In raising the
money for what had been done and was
to be done, the people were called upon
again. To date all funds had been
raised by small donations. Letters were
sent out asking for contributions and
the results were encouraging. People
seemed eager to help with this recrea-
tion program which was developing in-
to something far beyond their expecta-
tions. Activities were put on by various
groups throughout this period—all
proving to be successful.

A fine toboggan slide was construct-
ed and ski trails were set up. Winter
Haven had been selected as an appro-
priate name and, ultimately, came that
great day of the dedication ceremony. It
meant much more than just crowds of
people, dinners, parades, queens and
shows; it meant the culmination of five
months of excellent cooperation of the
people of Sartell plus dynamic leader-
ship. The town had awakened to a new
and exciting venture.

All the work of the project was vol-
unteer—with no hired help whatsoever;
and it has not gone unrewarded. In
his speech at‘ the dedication ceremony,

 

First project completed by volunteer workers was skating rink.

Governor Youngdahl pointed out that
never before had he seen “such wonder-
ful spirit of teamwork and community
cooperation as went into the construc-
tion of this beautiful playground.” He
considered it a splendid “example of the
cooperation we should have throughout
the state.

Father Ramacher also believes that
every community should have organ-
ized recreation of some sort. He recog-
nizes how boring, how uninteresting a
small town can be at times to young
people if no attempt is made to provide
adequate entertainment for them. And
not only youth but also adults should
be able to enjoy the facilities. Winter
Haven is becoming a center for every-
one, and present plans to include swim-
ming, horseback riding and tennis will
bring more and more people together
to take advantage of all-season oppor-
tunities.

Father Ramacher is emphatic regard-
ingi another aspect of Winter Haven.
He believes that it “has solved the prob-
lem of religious differences because _
people of all religions work side by side
on these projects for the common good
of their community.”

He has traveled between six and
eight thousand miles throughout Min-
nesota and the region, trying to create
an active interest in similar projects in
other small towns; some day his
dreams may become reality.

Boston Gets a Rubber

John R. Moore

ANEW RUBBER PLAYGROUND surface
was installed in Boston last fall
on a totlot located opposite the Cathe-
dral Housing Project on Harrison Ave-
nue. The sixty-by-eighty-foot play-
ground, equipped with swings, teeters
and junglegym, was coated with asphalt,
then covered with a rubber powder.
The installation in Boston, part of a

progressive program instituted by Park‘

Commissioner Frank R. Kelley and Di-
rector of Community Recreation Serv-
ice Alvin G. Kenney, shows their keen
interest in solving a serious playground
problem. The material was furnished
by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Com-
pany of Akron, Ohio, and installed
under the supervision of their techni-
cians.

This Boston project is being watched
-with considerable interest. In comment-
ing upon the rubber surface, the Chris-
tian Science Monitor stated that it
would “replace the cork asphalt surface
that hitherto was the best that could be
found for the purpose.” The rubber is
more resilient than the cork and costs
appreciably less.

The construction of the rubber sur-
face is simple and it can be installed
Upon any water-sealed surface—such as
conCrete, asphalt or bound macadam.
The only materials required are asphalt
emulsion and rubber playground aggre-
gate. The only tools necessary, other
than brooms and shovels, are emulsion
spray equipment and a roller. The
emulsion sprayer can be anything from
a small portable pump attached to a
drum to a large road distributor, de-
pending upon the size of the job or the
equipment on hand.

After the area to be covered is swept
clean, it is sprayed with a thin coat of

ment of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.

emulsion. Following this, rubber aggre-
gate is spread evenly over the surface
at the rate of five pounds per square
yard. It is then sprayed with emulsion
and, again, rubber aggregate is spread
over the surface. After the emulsion
has had time to break, it is ready to be
rolled. If a power roller is not avail-
able, a heavily-loaded, two-man hand
roller can be used satisfactorily.

Since the cementing material is an
emulsion, the speed at which the work
can progress depends largely upon the
weather. For example, this surface can-
not be constructed during cold weather
as the asphalt hardens too quickly to
disperse properly throughout the rub-
her.

A small amount of loose material
over the surface is desirable since it
makes a more uniform and cleaner-ap-
pearing playground. However, if de-
sired, the excess material can be swept
off after a couple of weeks, when the
asphalt has cured.

The two five-pound applications of
rubber aggregate give a mat thickness
of approximately three-eighths of an
inch. If additional thickness is desired,
the surface can again be sprayed with
emulsion and an additional five pounds
of rubber applied. This process can be
repeated until the desired thickness is
obtained, but time should be allowed
between each application for the asphalt
to cure.

Areas that become scuffed or worn—

such as sections under swings—can be
patched by simply spraying with emul-
sion, applying rubber aggregate and
tamping.

The Firestone Tire and Rubber Com-
pany has been developing and testing
this material for the past three years
and is currently trying to develop im-
proved methods of application and
asphaltic cements.

I I AVE YOU RUN OUT of ideas for new

and interest-compelling bulletin
boards? Does each individual poster—
to say nothing of a change of the entire
board—seem to take so much time and
effort that you sometimes neglect the
project completely? Has the board he-
come so dull and uninteresting that no
one, including yourself, pays much at-
tention to it?

Perhaps you could use easier ways
of making posters or types of bulletin
boards which don’t need to be changed
so often.

Have you: tried mounting magazine
pictures instead of attempting to draw
all of your own? To publicize pet
shows, for instance, there always are
colorful pictures of puppies which
would be more appealing than any you
might draw.

Illustrations of thickly-frosted cakes
might advertise cake sales. Occasionally
you come across large, attractive pic-
tures of children engaged in the various
activities which you might be sponsor-
ing. Build up a file of such illustrations
and, when it comes time for dances,
formals, pool tournaments and the like,
you may have on hand just the ones

the current magazines!

In addition, there remains a certain
amount of printing to be done. Perhaps
you might find stencils useful. You can
cut out two or three alphabets, both
capitals and small letters, in different
sizes. Of course, this means some work
in the beginning; but it also means
that you won’t always have to do it
yourself. There usually are young folks
around who are eager to help. (In fact,
the only reason you can’t use more of
their free-hand contributions is because
they violate so many of the rules of
good lettering or poster making.) With
the aid of stencils and magazine pic-
tures, however, your young volunteers
can turn out pieces which are quite ac-
ceptable. They won’t have to lean upon
these aids too long, either.

Actually, your crafts or art groups
should be able to help tremendously,
too. Perhaps your art leader will be
glad to conduct a few sessions on post-
er making, or his group might want
to take over the poster project on a
regular basis.

Spatter printing and silk screen

RECREATION I

  
 

Harry L. Morrison

CITIZENS, advisory committee in

Alameda, California, recently
conducted a survey of municipal golf
courses in the state in order to obtain
information which would enable the
committee to make recommendations
for the improvement of the city’s mu-
nicipal courses. The survey contained
questions concerning the size of the
golf course, original and improve-
l ments costs, type of course administra-
tion, number of personnel and their
costs, whether the personnel were on a
full-time or part-time basis, the amount
of revenue obtained and whether the
golf course concessions were audited.

The twenty-three cities replying varied

in population from Mill Valley (6,119)
to Los Angeles (2,008,500).

The amount of land used for golf
courses was reported as varying from
thirty-five acres in Pacific Grove to
Pasadena’s 380 acres, with an average
land area of about 150 acres. Original
costs varied greatly from city to city,
but the cost of improvements averaged
between $50,000 and $100,000. Fifteen
was the usual number of men employed
upon the city golf courses, which were
generally under the supervision of the
park or recreation department. These
employees were, for the most part, on a

full-time basis, and their combined sal-
aries were about $3,800 a month or
$36,000 a year. Many of the courses
are managed by a professional golfer,
who is allowed to give lessons and even
operate concessions in addition to his
managerial duties.

It was not possible to obtain the an-
nual running cost in most cities because
of the great differences in accounting
for the expenditures of the courses.

The revenues received from them
ranged from $171,000 in Pasadena to
$11,000 in Antioch. However, the rev-
enue information obtained was not too
useful as some cities gave a net revenue
statement while others used only their
gross revenue figures. A majority of
the selected cities audited the financial
transactions of the golf course conces-
sions, but the rest had no audit in effect
at the time of the survey.

From the information received, it
was felt that general improvements
could be made in the cost and adminis-
tration of most courses if the manager
of the golf course could be made di-
rectly responsible to the park or recrea-
tion department, with an advisory
board for golf course affairs if required
and feasible. The combination of golf
professional and manager was ques-
tioned as an administrative agreement
and it was thought that, where possible,
there should be a separate manager.

of Municipal Golf

Courses in California

  

 
 

The data surveyed revealed the defi-
nite need for separate accounting for
this proprietary function. Even if the
course is operating as a service and
not as a source of revenue, there is still
a need for distinct accounts in order to
analyze and control the costs of the
municipal course. This need was partic-
ularly emphasized by the difhculty
which some cities had in stating their
operating costs and their net revenue.

Lastly, it could be concluded from
the survey that there is a need in a
great many cities for increased audi-
ting of concessions. The lack of such an
audit breaks down administrative con-
trols and creates confusion in the minds
of all concerned as to the total financial
status of the municipal golf course.

The municipal golf course has be-
come another business which the civic
governments have acquired for the serv-
ice of citizens and as a source of rev-
enue. A business, whether public or
private, should be administered in such
a way that the greatest service is given
and the most revenue is obtained.

It is hoped that this article will bring
closer to those concerned with the
municipal golf courses the need for a
sharp scrutiny of their present opera-
tions in order that this facet of city
service and finance can be of more serv-
ice with improved recreation and
greater municipal revenues.

George Washington and the Theatre

HE FIRST PRESIDENT of the United Company to perform Julius Caesar in
States was an ardent theatre-goer.

So much did he believe in the beneficial
influence of the theatre, in fact, that

during the bitter winter at Valley Forge
he permitted performances of plays,
which he also attended—and this, de-
spite a Congressional ban, enacted in
1774, on plays and other amusements.

As a young militia colonel during
the French and Indian War, George
Washington harbored ambitions to be
an actor himself. From Fort Cumber-
land, in 1759, he wrote to Mrs. George
\Villiam Fairfax, after alluding to the
probable failure of the campaign, “I
should think our time more agreeably
spent, believe me, in playing a part in
Cato with the company you mention
and myself doubly happy in being the
Juba to such a Marcia as you must
make.”

Addison’s Cato was the most popular
play in America during a large part of
Washington’s life, and his diaries re-
cord that he saw it many times. Twice
in his life, in times of crises, he quoted
from the play in letters to friends. First,
during the dark hours of the revolu-
tion, to express his mistrust of his own
ability, he repeated “ ’Tis not in mor-
tals to command success.” Later, as
first president of the infant republic,
faced with political perplexities and
longing to return to his beloved and
familiar Mount Vernon, he quoted,
“The post of honor is a private station.”

Washington’s diaries noted that he
attended theatre as often as three times
a week and invited friends, visiting dig-
nitaries and ambassadors to join him.

In 1790, while occupying the presi-
dential mansion in New York, he in-
vited a troupe called the American

looked he Darby? Was he short or
tall?’, his countenance showed embar-
rassment, from the expectation of one
of those eulogisms which he had been
obliged to hear on many public occa-
sions, and which must doubtless have
been a severe trial to his feelings; but
Darby’s answer that he had not seenl
him, because he had mistaken a man
‘all lace and glitter, botherum and
shine’ for him until the show had
passed, relieved the hero from appre-
hension of further personality, and so
he indulged in that which was with him
extremely rare, a hearty laugh.” -

George Washington Parke Curtis, I
grandson of Mrs. Washington, in hisl
Recollections, writes of this period: “In
New York, the playbill was headed, ‘Byl
particular desire,’ when it was an-
nounced that the president would at-
tend.”

The final visit of Washington to the
theatre occurred on February 27, 1797.
Claypole’s American Daily Advertiser
of that date announced: “We are in-
formed that the President of the United
States will be at the representation of
the new comedy, The Way to Get Mar-
ried, this evening, at the New Theatre.”
The advertisement of the play in the
same paper read:

the executive mansion. His nephew,
George Washington Curtis, a profes-
sional actor, played the part of Cassius.
Those present, according to the diary
of William A. Duer, who took the part
of Brutus, included ‘the magnates of
the land and the elite of the city.”

During and after the revolution,
three playwrights used George Wash—
ington as protagonist of their plays and
he is known to have witnessed them.
Thomas Laycock’s The Fall of British
Tyranny presented him as the hero.
The Battle of Brooklyn, an anonymous
farce written by a Tory and unsympa-
thetic to the cause of freedom, drew
the general as the one honest and high-
principled man of a band of rogues.
The Patriot Chief, written in 1784 by
Peter Markoe, was a tragedy based
upon his revolutionary services. An—
other play that he saw, in which many
passages make direct reference to him,
was Dunlap’s Darby’s Return.

Here is an eyewitness account of
Washington’s reaction to the last: “The
eyes of the audience were frequently
bent on his countenance and to watch-
the emotions produced by any particu-
lar passage upon him was the simulta-
neous employment of all. When Wig-
nell, as Darby, recounted what had be-
fallen him in New York, at the adoption
of the Federal Constitution and the in-
auguration of the President . . ., Wash-
ington smiled at these lines alluding to
the change in the government ——

California’s Recreation Boom

California is reported to be in the middle of its biggest
boom in the development of recreation facilities.

The state has adopted a seventy-eight million dollar
highway, construction and improvement program for 1951,
making many new facilities available for the first time.

In Los Angeles, for example, beach facilities have been
4 doubled since the opening, last summer, of the new Venice
Beach development. This lengthens the beach from three
' miles to six and widens it from seventy-five to six hundred
fifty feet. Its capacity is increased eight times so that it
will now accommodate five hundred thousand people.

A tract of virgin forest at Idyllwild, to be left as a primi-
tive area, was recently dedicated by the Girl Scouts of
America as the Lou Henry Hoover Memorial Forest, after
the late wife of former President Herbert Hoover. This
tract will be used by the Scouts for nature study and will
be open to the public. .

In Los Padre National Forest at Santa Barbara, a new
three hundred thousand-acre tract has been thrown open
to fishermen, deer hunters and to the general public.

In addition, many other California communities are con-
tributing to the widespread recreation expansion program.

Center for GI Joes

The Chicago Servicemen’s Center, on the third floor of
308 N. Michigan Avenue, is the city’s first club to be
opened for members of the armed forces since World

War II.

Members of Chicago labor unions, building companies,
‘ furniture stores and civic groups donated their services to
remodel and decorate the center—equipping it with a dance
floor, snack bar, checkroom, information booth and ten
thousand dollars worth of comfortable furniture.

The Community Fund has earmarked fifty thousand dol-
lars to be used for operation of the Servicemen’s Center
and a staff of volunteers and three paid workers have been
assigned to assist Director of Recreation, Stuart McCutch-
eon, with the program.

Massachusetts Conference

March 15, 16 and 17 have been the dates set aside for the
Fifteenth Annual Recreation Conference at the University

of Massachusetts in Amherst. Volunteer and professional
leaders of public and private recreational agencies, clubs
and groups will participate.

The conference this year will be conducted on a work-
shop basis. Fields to be covered will include archery, arts
and crafts, community recreation, folk songs and dances,
festivals, mountaineering, nature recreation, tennis and
winter sports.

Lebert Weir Memorial Library

The School of Health, Physical Education and Recrea-

tion of Indiana University will house the library of Lebert
H. Weir, a former alumnus, class of 1903, who, for nearly
forty years, was district field representative for the National

Recreation Association in the midwest states. Books which
he wrote, copies of his recreation surveys and manuscripts
and publications by other leaders in the field will be part of
the collection. The memorial library was donated to the
department of recreation by Mrs. Weir.

The department also has created a Lebert H. Weir Me-
morial Student Loan and Scholarship Fund to which its

former graduate students are each donating ten thousand
dollars.

_ Swan Song
On December 31, 1950, Cecil Mills of Wabash, Indiana,

retired from his position as director of activities of the

Wabash Community Service, Incorporated, after thirty
years of service.

In a letter of appreciation to the National Recreation
Association “for the fine help and cooperation which I have
received . . . during all the years of my work in Wabash,”

Mr. Mills also included a poem dedicated to the NRA “since

this is in a way my swan song.” The first of the ten
stanzas reads:

“A great heart’s beating in New York,
Its pulse runs through the nation,
And every beat sends loads and loads
Of joy through recreation.”

Job Situation

IN GENERAL, the demand for profes-
sional workers was stronger in 1950
than for the preceding year. There was
continued difiiculty in finding recrea-
tion superintendents for the smaller
communities. These positions require a
variety of talents characterizing the
administrator, community organizer,
program supervisor and leader. Fre-
quently, the salaries in the small com-
munities are not particularly attrac-
tive and the general working conditions
are not always satisfactory. During the
year, seventy-three per cent of the ex-
ecutive positions filled were in commu-
nities of twenty-five thousand popula-
tion and under. Fifty-seven per cent of
these positions were in communities of
fifteen thousand and under. The short-
age of personnel is increasing as a re-
sult, in part, of the war situation. A few
local workers have been called for mili-
tary duty, necessitating replacements.
Also, the increased demand for work-
ers in such fields as hospital recreation
has drawn off what otherwise might be
a part of the personnel surplus. There
is increasing evidence that more of our
professional workers will be called upon
soon for military service, which will

complicate the situations in many local
communities.

In fact, the armed forces’ need for
women recreation workers continues to
be urgent, and additional recruiting

exist in most of the army areas in the
continental United States.

The American Red Cross still has
vacancies in accordance with earlier
communications. For further informa-
tion, write directly to the national head-
quarters in Washington, D. C.

Training

Training programs, in general, have
been increased and intensified. More
attention has been given to local in-
service training programs, and several
cities have provided special projects for
apprentices. The number of colleges and
universities offering recreation courses
also has increased. The training ses-
sions held at the National Recreation
Congress in Cleveland showed increased
attendance over preceding years.

The National Conference on Gradu-
ate Training, held at PereMarquette
State Park in Illinois, has supplemented
the National Conference on Under-
graduate Training, held in 1948. The
special committees for these two na-
tional conferences have been consoli-
dated into a Continuing Committee
which has, as one of its major objec-
tives, the promotion of more local,
state and regional training conferences.

The overall purpose of these activities
is the improvement of professional edu-

Recreation training courses in col-
leges, leading to bachelor’s and gradu-
ate degrees, have increased consider-
ably in recent years. It would be helpful
to the recreation movement as a whole

to have a record of the extent of these
offerings.

A number of colleges have submitted
information which has been kept up-to-
date in the association’s library. We
hope that others will feel free to re-
port new courses when they are intro-
duced or advise when adjustments are
made in existing curriculums.

The NRA would be very pleased to
receive not only the curriculum as it is
printed in the school catalog, but also
copies of individual course outlines
when they are available. It is increas-
ingly important to know more about
the content of individual courses.

The colleges also could help in an-
other way by keeping the association
informed of the number of students
graduating each year with undergradu-
ate and graduate degrees in recreation.
Our recruiting plans could be worked\;
out more effectively with this advance 
information. New prospects should be

registered two to three months prior to
their availability.

F ontbonne College of St. Louis Uni- V2.

music therapy leading to the Bachelor

Arts degree. During the senior year,
rt of each week is spent in internship

he psychiatrists at this institution are
embers of the faculty of the St. Louis
niversity Medical School, with which
e music therapy course is affiliated.

Most of the work is in music—forty-
three semester hours devoted to it—-—
with three courses in sociology, five in

 
   
  
   
  

last group includes English, speech,
philosophy, science, general humanities
and physical education.

As early as possible, the student is
given the Opportunity of observing and
participating in programs arranged for
the patients at the various hospitals in
the vicinity so that she may become
familiar with the work and adjust to
the new environment of her contem-
plated field.

The announcement indicates that a
number of institutions employ music
therapists and that the demand will
probably grow even more when the
field becomes better known and there
are more therapists prepared to do the
work from a professional viewpoint.

Salaries

Salaries continued to increase in
1950. There is still room for improve-
ment, particularly with reference to
staff workers. Of the executive posi-
tions known to have been filled during
the year, the median salary was $4,000;
the range, from $3,000 to $7,200. One
of the urgent needs for the future is the
improvement of working conditions in
general, including more acceptable

salary standards.

Recruiting

With the decrease in the number of
workers available, recruiting programs
have been increased. Local departments
will need to conduct more vigorous re-
cruiting programs, and their positions
will need to be made more attractive in
order to secure qualified and capable
workers. There is increasing evidence
that a definite relationship exists be-
tween the availability of workers with
professional qualifications and the rate

of pay in the field.

FEBRUARY 1951

Recreation executives, other profes-
sional workers and friends of the rec:
reation movement should continue to

Ezee Knitter

The Ezee Knitter, a circular frame
of lightweight, durable Tenite plastic
equipped with 154 Tenite pegs, teaches

 

knitting ,without needles. Simple to
operate, it can be used to knit any gar-
ment or article requiring up to 154
stitches. Knitting is accomplished by
winding two rows of yarn about the
pegs and then lifting the lower strands
over them with a crochet hook. The
finished work comes out at the bottom
of the plastic frame, through the slot
between the two bands of pegs. Many
different patterns can be made by vary-
ing the manner of winding, and in-
structions from any knitting book can

be followed.

 

Health Safeguards

Twin conveniences and health safe-
guards for all institutions offering ath-
letic facilities are the Vanguard cuspi-
dor and Vanbrook drinking fountain
manufactured by Kohler.

Both are built of permanently-lus-
trous vitreous china and have identical
specifications—over-all thirty-inch
height, sixteen-and-one-half—inch width
and eleven-inch front to back measure-
ment. The inside depth, front to back,
is ten inches.

The Vanguard and the Vanbrook are
designed for recessing into walls, there-
by increasing the safety factor of play-
ing floors. It is said that coaches and
physical educators approve of the cus-
pidor because it promotes sanitation
and helps prevent colds and infections
from spreading.

 

The drinking fountain is equipped
with a non-squirting bubbler head and
a self-closing control valve adjustable
for continuous flow. There is also an
automatic volume regulator. All fittings
are of chromium-plated brass.

Leadership of Youth

Ben Solomon. Youth Service, Incor-

porated, Putnam Valley, New York.
$3.00.

IN HIS NEW BOOK, Ben Solomon main-
tains that altogether too many peo-
ple are called leaders who don’t at all
deserve the title. “In the field of recre-
ation, for instance, it seems that every-
body from the part-time playground
leader up to the administrators are
called leaders. . . However, exceedingly
few of them were hired on the basis of
their leadership qualities or training in
the use of leadership techniques.”

Mr. Solomon, who is author of sev-
eral other publications, as well as editor
of Youth Leaders Digest and special
lecturer and teacher at New York Uni-
versity and Springfield College, then
goes on to discuss, in detail, such im-
portant topics as what is a leader; mis-
conceptions of leadership; techniques;
the great demand for true leaders; and
many other problems of particular in-
terest to those in the recreation field.

In his chapter on “Development and
Training,” he states: “Leadership quali-
ties are strictly personal. They reside
inside the individual like other quali-
ties of love and hate, kindness and con-
sideration, generosity and greed. . .
Just as each and every person has all
of these qualities in varying degrees, so
do they have the quality of leader-
ship, also in widely varying degrees.”

One of the highlights of the book is
the chapter by Ethel Bowers on leader-
ship with girls and women. The sugges-
tions which she gives, together with
her program hints, should prove help-
ful to leaders of both sexes.

In addition, an appendix entitled
“Earmarks of a Leader” has been in-
cluded which concisely outlines: The
Aims of Leadership in Youth-Serving
Agencies; Major Qualifications; Sum-
mary of General Principles and Tech-

THIS NEW, GRADED reading list for
children in the elementary grades
was carefully prepared by an elemen-
tary reading list committee of the coun-
cil, chaired by Margaret Mary Clark,
head of the Lewis Carroll Room in the
Cleveland Public Library. One thous-
and annotated titles and some 250
additional listed titles are oEered for
adult use with children in kindergarten
and the first six grades. This should be
extremely helpful to program leaders,
storytellers and parents, as well as to
teacher‘s——in fact to anyone who has
anything to do with children within this
age level.

Northwest Angling

Enos Bradner. A. S. Barnes and Com-

a book for every angler. Low land lake
fishing, mountain lake fishing, a short
history of the Pacific Coast steelhead,
the sea-run cutthroat as a sport fish,

The Planning, Construction
and Maintenance of
Playing Fields

Percy White Smith. Oxford University
Press, London. 36.00.

HE AUTHOR of this book states that
Tits purpose is mainly “to outline
acceptable standards in relation to the
development and use of playing space
by the general public, based upon the
experience of the National Playing
Fields Association since its inception
over twenty-one years ago.” As Sir
George L. Pepler, chairman of the As-
sociation’s Grounds and Layout Com-
mittee, points out in the foreword, the
author writes with authority on the
problems of construction and mainte-

The playground designs shown in the
book illustrate areas which differ widely
in size and nature from typical play-
grounds in this country. Playing fields
are devoted almost exclusively to indi-
vidual and team sports and do not pro-
vide some of the features commonly in-
cluded on American fields. In addition,
little consideration is given in the book
to allowance for the accommodation of
spectators.

However, the many photographs
showing equipment used in the con-
struction and maintenance of playing
fields, the carefully-prepared diagrams
illustrating various design and con-
struction methods and materials and
the detailed suggestions for procedure
help make this an interesting, useful
and practical volume. — George D.
Butler, Director of Research, National
Recreation Association.

THIS COMPREHENSIVE BOOK is an ideal
handbook for amateur theatrical
groups and others interested in any
phase of the subject of play production.
It summarizes the special techniques
and psychology developed by theatre
people during the past three thousand
years, covering every aspect Of the field

Making Useful Things Of Wood

Franklin H. Cottshall. The Bruce Pub-
lishing Company, Milwaukee, Wis-
consin. $4.50.

HIRTY-THREE PROJECTS—involving
Tcabinet-making, turning, carving,
designing, finishing and so forth—are
featured in this volume, with full infor-
mation on materials needed, step-by-
step procedure, sketches and drawings
or photographs of the finished articles.

The directions are clear and detailed;
the articles, well-selected and in good
taste. This book should be valuable to
hobbyists with home workshops, to
shop teachers in schools and to wood-
work leaders in community recreation
centers. The projects require a certain
amount of skill and knowledge and
have not been designed for children or
beginners. This is a good book for se-
rious work, which will result in useful
articles—Virginia Musselman, Corre-
spondence and Consultation Bureau,
National Recreation Association.

The Poetic Parrot

Margaret Mackay. The John Day Com-

pany, New York. $2.50.

PERCY is a poetic parrot. He says
everything in rhyme, from “Camels,
camels, stupid mammals” to his last
speech in ninety-six delightful pages,
“Man-about-town, gay as a clown!”
He’s one hundred fifty years old, and

his adventures when he escapes from
the Central Park Zoo will be the talk Of
the playground. Storytellers, take
notice! The small fry from five to
twelve will love Percy.

Needle in Hand

Martha G. Stearns. Ives Washburn, In-
corporated, New York. $3.50.

MRS. STEARNS has been a leader in

the New England revival of crafts

and has had several one-man exhibi-
tions of her own work. Her purpose in
this book is to “give a very practical
description of stitches, how to use them,
how to make them effective, and how
to make a start in creating our own
designs; in other words, the technique
of decorative‘needlework.”

Her success in meeting this challenge
may be judged by the statement of
Frank Staples, arts and crafts special-
ist of the National Recreation Associa-
tion: “The book should be put on ourI
book list. It is the best I have ever seen
on the subject.”

Needle in Hand also contains a bibli-
ography, a good index, sketches and .
photographs and a chapter on “The
Market for Handwork” —- something
which will please home craftsmen.

Keeping Idle Hands Busy

Marion R. Spear. Burgess Publishing _
Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

$1.75. I

MARION R. SPEAR, O.T.R., is director "
of the Kalamazoo School of 0c- I
cupational Therapy, Western Michigan
College Of Education. Her ninety-six-
page, spiral bound book is a source
book of ideas for those with limited I
budget, but blessed with imagination '
and resourcefulness. It is therefore par-
ticularly suitable for occupational ther-
apists, recreational therapists, house-
wives, camp leaders—and, of course, "
for playground leaders. I

The four parts of the book suggest I
interesting uses for various types of in-
expensive or discarded material—cloth,
native products (we’d prefer the head-
ing “Nature Products”), paper and
wood. Each section is detailed and in- E
teresting, and the many attractive 'r‘.
sketches show good taste and imagina-
tion.

Keeping Idle Hands Busy does not
give specific and detailed instructions.
It’s not a how-tO-do, but a what-to-
do, book—and will be a very handy 
“spark plug” for crafts leaders who
need ideas—Virginia M usselman.
