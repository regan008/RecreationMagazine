 

DRAMA

A year-round recreation which rates high with all age groups

area too remote for pageants, plays, festivals and other such
entertainment. The following list offers material for organizing
and producing your drama program and for introducing new
ideas to Your community. All publications are available from

RECREATION

Recreation, physical education,
group work! How often one hears
these words used interchangeably or
together these days! There is a grow-
ing awareness that representatives of
all three of these groups have many
common concerns about the communi-
ty’s state of well-being.

Although the words have general
meaning to those who use them, there
is, however, a surprising lack of under-
standing among representatives of the
groups they describe. There is an even
greater misunderstanding among in-
dividuals of the citizenry at large, who
hear these words loosely used by so-
called “professionals” in talking about
community programs of recreation
services .

I recently participated in a study
of recreation services and facilities in
a relatively largely-populated county in
upstate New York. This county has a
large city almost in its geographical
center, and the purpose of the study
was partly to discover the extent of
services being provided in the county
area outside the city limits by recrea-
tion agencies with headquarters in the
city. In addition, there was a study of
existing programs in the county show-
ing sponsorship, leadership, financing
and so on. As the study progressed, it
became ohvious that the county rcerea-
tion program as a whole was really a
collection of many separatc bits of
program, heing provided by many dif-
ferent groups. For example, in one
rural community, a community-council-
sponsored recreation program operated
two nights a week during the winter.
This council was jointly supported by
funds from the county Community
Chest and by puhlic allocations made
possible by reimbursement from the
New York State Youth Commission.
The director of the community recrea-
tion program was the physical educa-
tion instructor of the local high school!

In the same community were Boy
Scout, Girl Scout and Camp Fire
groups which were part of Community
Chest agencies with headquarters in
the city. There were also 4-H Clubs and
Home Bureau Units, with an even
more complicated system of support
through county, state and federal funds
. . . This illustration vividly points up
how great the need for better under-
standing is in this area of providing

The Relationship of Recreation,
Physical Education and Group Wurk

GUEST EDITORIAL

recreation services for communities.

In the first place, we need to clarify
the relationship of recreation, physical
education and group work. Physical
education and group work are alike in
that they are both methods of working
with people. Recreation is distinctive
in that it represents a field of activities
so organized or planned that it gives to
the individual, or to the individual in
a group, “the sense of satisfaction that
is re~creative.” Some people may say
that recreation per se implies socially-
eonstructive activities which are there-
fore “good” for society. Others feel
that . . . how the individual uses it
will determine its contribution to
society. No matter what we agree upon
in this respect, there is common ac-
ceptance of recreation as a field of
activities essentially taking place in the
leisure time of man that provides an
enjoyable or satisfying experience and
that, out of this experience, the indi-
vidual finds renewed strength in his
adjustment to the world about him.

Physical education is a method of
using the body as a means of expres-
sion whereby the individual achieves a
sense of physical well-being through
the process of either individual
achievement or of participating in a
structure of relationships to others. As
a method of working with people,
physical education plays an important
role in the recreation services of a com-
munity . . .

Group work, or, more properly,
social group work, is perhaps the least
understood . . . It is a method of work-
ing with individuals in groups whereby
a worker trained in the hroad disci-
pline of social work helps individuals

tive Program in Social Work.

to relate themselves more effectively to
each other and to experience growth
opportunities in the process. This
growth is in the direction of socially-
desirable goals which, in our coun-
try, are inherent in the democratic
process. The worker in social group
work is trained in the knowledge of
individual and group behavior, and the
main emphasis of this method is upon
individual and group growth. Social
group work uses many recreation
activities but, like physical education,
its application is not limited to the
field of recreation. It does, however,
ofier distinctive contributions to the
use of the group method in the reerea-
tion field, and all people working as
professionals in recreation can profit
from its contributions.

With these factors in mind—of the
actual relatedness of these methods and
the field of recreation—there is, there-
fore, need in the future for more care-
ful planning . . . Schools of training
in each of these fields need to make
sure that all of their students have an
understanding of the philosophies,
methods and contributions of all three.

Most of all, we need an integration
of our individual philosophies. Ba-
sieally, we are all striving for the same
goals, but what Einstein did for the
integration of mathematical philosOphy,
someone must do for the integration of
philosophies of those groups which
strive to help individuals to achieve a
more enjoyable relationship to the
world in which they live.

THE PARK SCHOOL

Sirs:

I heartily agree with Malcolm Kirkpatrick
on the principles established in his article
-—which appeared in your October issue—
regarding the park-school, but cannot agree
with the use of the word “functional.”
“Functional,” tO me, implies a smoothly
Operating facility that will jointly improve
the Operation of the program. School and
park programs may supplement each other
and, where they can be supplemented, cer-
tainly coordination is essential and city
planning vital for bOth school and park.

Unfortunately, most Of the headaches in-
volved in the park-sehOOl facility are nOt_
from the construction and design angle
so much as from that Of use. Both school
and recreation need space during the
morning, afternoon and evening. Its great-
est shortage appears to be during the morn-
ing and afternoons. As community needs
are more adequately met, more and more
individuals are seeking their outlet in the
hours traditionally accepted as school hours.
The changing living habits affected by
earlier retirement, population shifts, the
employment Of mothers, economic and social
changes, come intO conflict with established
school procedures. Community centers must
be an accepted part Of the normal facili-
ties of a community as are the school build-
ings. Much cost and duplication can be
eliminated in a better coordination Of Space
and planning for major sports and mass
activities which now cannot be confined to
the centers.

Speaking of interschool competition as we
see it, the conflict arises chiefly in the use
Of facilities. The majority Of schools carry-
ing on an intensified athletic competition
program prefer tO reserve their major turfed
fields for the limited football season, rather
than allow for over-all neighborhood and
industry usage tbroughout the school year
and the summer months. These specialized
fields are not multiple-purpose and are eost-
ly. When industry works with the recrea-
tion department and does not build its
own facilities, it becomes more and more
important that school and park and reerea-
tion facilities be available for practice pur-
poses as well as for competition. We regret
the prevalent practice of extensive hard sur-
face areas within the elementary school

program, thereby putting them out Of use for
additional summer playground facilities. Psy-
ehOIOgically, one cannot draw the neighbor-
hood back tO these sites without the land-
seaping of the natural aspects Of a park.
The school should be a functional fa-
cility for community use, but it must be
considered as a SUpplementary facility. Sup-
plementary facilities require as much careful
planning as major facilities for more ad-
vantage tO taxpayers.

S irs:

Mr. Malcolm Kirkpatriek’s article should
be read by both professional and lay per-
sonnel in education and recreation. It would
be desirable for boards of education, park
and recreation commissions and planning
Ofiicials tO observe some of the principles
and comments advanced in it. It is thought-
provoking and contains amplification Of the
basic concept emphasized at the Jackson’s
Mill, West Virginia, Conference held in
1947, on planning facilities for health edu-
cation, physical education and recreation.

Special attention is directed tO some Of
the key thoughts, such as: “Site selection is
something more than seizing the cheapest
piece Of vacant land available within the
area Of need.” “The stock plan and stock
thinking have been a curse upon the school
building and playground. . . .” “The park-
sehOOl building should be considered first
and foremost nOt as a thing apart, but
as one Of the several elements—a hank Of
tennis courts, a play area or a parking area.
The point here is that land areas are not
elements fitted into what is left over from
a predetermined building area.” (ltalies
mine.) “The asphalt jungles that have come
tO mean ‘playground’ tO us are a disgrace
tO our native ingenuity.”

It would seem extremely desirable for
those who have access tO this article tO have
it reproduced for distribution tO key local
government officials, as it represents the
best thinking in terms Of joint planning
and functional uses which lead directly to
provision of facilities and economical opera-
tion.

RIFLE INSTRUCTION

S irs :

The article, “Rifle Instruction,” in the
October issue of RECREATION magazine, has
many ramifications which should be checked
thoroughly before such a program is intro-
duced into community recreation.

One factor is the age of the participants.
A twenty-two caliber rifle is a lethal weapon,
belonging in the same category as knives
and automobiles. Only more mature groups
should receive instruction, as their actions
will be more responsible and less prone
toward accidents and deliberate acts which
will endanger the community. One of the
pet ideas brought out at the recent Na-
tional Recreation Congress in Boston was
that of training younger boys and girls in
the correct handling of BB guns. Maybe this

could be the first step leading to rifle in-
struction.

Another factor is the instructor-load and
the proficiency of the instructor. Unless the
instruction is capable and there is time
for individual supervision, there are many
dangers inherent in such a program.

Another point is that of an effective “fol-
low-up” program, to insure that stimulated
interest in rifles is channeled into construe-
tive activities.

The mores of the community may be
such that hunting and/or fishing comprise
the chief activities. Rifle instruction would
then lend itself to the nature of the com-
munity and would be advisable at a much
earlier age than in an urban community.

There cannot be too much emphasis placed
upon the responsibility of adults, not only
in the matter of providing firearms for their
children, but in the control and supervision
of these weapons once they are placed in
the hands of younger members of a com-
munity. Only hy this “grass-roots” method
can adequate control be insured for this
potentially dangerous type of activity.

ALFRED L. COTTRILL, Supervisor of Boys’
and Men’s Activities, Bureau of Recreation,
Baltimore, Maryland.

S irs :

In regard to “Rifle Instruction,” as car-
ried on in a recreation program, we have
a wave of interest in this in our city. Our
rifle and pistol club has been in existence
for twenty-five years and, as an outgrowth
of that organization, all high schools are
interested in and have rifle instruction as
part of their curriculum. This is part of
the high school program when and if there

are eXpert instructors and a safe place for
shooting.

I look upon this activity with favor, if the
following points are adhered to:

l. Pr0per facilities.
2. An eXpert instructor to teach prOper meth-
ods of handling firearms.

3. Absolute control of the activity so as to
avoid accidents.

In our playground buildings and the
armory, where we are conducting our shoot-
ing program, we have observed that group
attendance does not lag and is most regu-
lar. There is a fascination about shooting
that appeals to teen-aged boys as well as
to mixed groups of adults. Our Rifle and
Pistol Shooters Association is made up of
men and women who have been active in
such activity from the beginning. All of our
organized groups are afiiliated with the Na-
tional Rifle Association.

CAMPING

Sirs:

For some time, our department has been
searching for a statement which adequately
describes the elements of a well-organized
camping program. We feel that such a state-
ment appeared in the summer issue of
RECREATION, in the article by Catherine T.
Hammett, “Camping: Its Part in National
Defense.” We should like to request permis-
sion to mimeograph a portion of this for
distribution among recreation and camping
pe0ple in this state.

WILLIAM B. POND, Supervisor, Recreation
Division, State Parks and Recreation Com-
mission, Washington.

TELEVISION

Sirs:

In commenting upon the article, “Televi-
sion, Friend or Foe?,” in the September
1951 issue of RECREATION, I should like to
say that television, today, is the greatest
foree known to man, serving to guide and
formulate public Opinion, attitudes and
ideas. Whether it will be friend or foe de-
pends Upon two groups of individuals—tele-
vision authorities and parents and viewers.

It is easy for television authorities to
pass the responsibility on to the viewers
and state that they, the stations, give the
viewers what they want. This particular
attitude has no place in our system of public
trust. Television and radio are both in this
category—they belong to no specific group,
but to all the peOple. Authorities in control
of television are obligated to provide prOper
public education and recreation whenever
the Opportunity arises. There is no reason
for exception. There is, or never was, a
program which is questionably good or bad.
If it does not contribute to social welfare,
it is undesirable! The television authorities
know good programs when they see them.
Let them act honestly and fearlessly lest
they lose, in the light of righteous criti-
cism, the privileges so often abused under
the guise of “freedom of speech”! Tele-
vision plays too big a part in American
life to be subjugated only to unwholesome
desires and the quest for financial profit.

The average viewer of television programs
has to be insulted before he responds to any
programs which come to his attention.
This challenge usually has to take the form
of indecency, obscenity, profanity, or just
plain insult to his good taste, intelligence
or judgment. Protest should not be made
to Federal authorities, but, rather, directly
to the station and sponsor. This is the level
at which it will be most effective; the fear
of lack of support will motivate programs

for all times to come. Organizations, bureaus
and agencies which attempt to boycott pro-
grams only will eall attention to those that
are not a force for good—witness'eensored
movies! The viewer must be honest with
himself and his family. Those programs
which are not good should be turned off
with a twist of the dial. Self-control and
discipline must come from within—it has
little or no value from without. There are
enough intelligent, serious-minded people
who can control “unethical” television pro-
grams, authorities and sponsors if they act
and act immediately. “The pen is mightier
than the sword.”

DEAR RECREATION READER

Because this magazine is yours, and
you are one of our reporters, as well
as a subscriber, we wish that you
would consider this letter as an edi-
torial staff meeting, at the beginning
of the new year. We need your con-
tinued help in making RECREATION the
type of magazine that you want. Here’s
how . . .

Please note, first of all, that the
title of our recreation comments sec-
tion, on page 4-22, has been changed
to “Letters.” We feel that this head
will be simpler, clearer. Do you agree?
Also, we again call your attention to
the possibilities of this magazine de-
partment, and ask your active support
in making it a lively one. It is designed
to give you, as a member of the recrea-
tion family, an opportunity to be
heard, to exchange opinions with
others on any matters of concern—
either about magazine content or pro-
cedures or about any recreation trends
-——which can benefit through opcn dis-
cussion. Have you, personally, con-
tributed a letter to this page? Do you
like the idea well enough to do some-
thing about it? Have you become ac-
customed to thinking of this section in
rclation to its purpose?

Recently we received a sincere let-
ter of criticism about one of our pub-
lished articles. When we mentioned
using it on our “Letters-to-the-Editor”
page, however, its author exploded in
indignation. “No,” said he, “I am not
seeking publicity.” Apparently, the
whole idea behind its use escaped him
—if he had ever stopped to think
about it! Why should writing for one
section of RECREATION mean “pub-
licity” any more than writing for any
other part? Maybe other people would

have appreciated hearing this man’s
vicws.

In writing to us, you will encourage
others to do the same, reaping the re-

424

ward of interesting and helpful rcad-
ing and assisting with the improvemcnt
of content in general.

May we hear from you soon and
often—in letter form? Be as brief as
you like, or as detailed. It will help if
you mark your communication, “Let-
ters-to-Editor” page.

RECIPES FOR FUN

Will you please let us know whether
you like or dislike “Recipes for Fun,”
and why? We want to know whether
to continue or discontinue it, in its
present form. What about other new
features—“Recreation Market News,”

“Personnel,” “Things You Should
Know,” “How to Do It”?

MANUSCRIPTS

Please double space bctween lines
on the manuscripts of all full-length
articles. Otherwisc, these have to be
retyped before any editing can bc
done. Sometimes this may make all
the difference in a decision as to
whether or not the material can be
used.

PHOTOGRAPHS

In mailing pictures, be sure to slip
a sturdy piece of cardboard into the
envelope for protection. Creasing can
ruin a photograph, and it is amazing
how many reach us in that condition.

PUBLICATION

Please do not be discouraged if your
contribution is not used immediately.
Remember that all material cannot be
used at once and that it is necessary
to hold many articles for future publi-
cation. Furthermore, each issue of the
magazine is now made up three months
in advance. Make your contributions
as colorful, interesting and helpful as
possible, and keep them coming!

A SIGN OF THE TIMES"

There was a sad little advertisement
in our paper the other day. Sad for
what it implies.

Trade your piano in as down pay-
ment on a television set, the adver-
tisement urged. In other words, don’t
create your own entertainment and
pleasure. Just squat down in front of
a TV set and let someone else cntcr-
tain you.

If that advertiscment, with the in-
evitable response to it, is a trend of
the times—and we fear very much
that it is—something that is not good
is happening to our way of life.

A lot of us can remcmber when
family and guests gathered around tllc
piano for a sing, and evcryone thought
it good fun. Wc can remcmber, with
pleasure now, the somewhat tortured
hours that thc youngstcrs spent on
thcir piano lessons, hours that wcrc
justified because thc childrcn were
learning to do something for them-
selves. Leaving the piano for a minute,
we recall the many simple pleasurcs of
a bygone era when there were no TV
sets and no radios. Try to tell a boy or
girl about the delights of a tafly pull
and you’ll be lookcd at as though you
were slightly queer. Tell a youngster
what fun you once had on long walks
through thc countryside and he’ll sure-
ly think you are nuts.

We have arrived at the age of squat
and look. Spectatoritis or squatitis is
the disease of the day. Children are
being encouraged to let others enter-
tain them rather than to entertain
themselves, and this training and
tendency extcnd on into their adult
lives. We sit and look whcn we should
walk and think, and convcrsation is a
lost art.

1950 by the commissioners of Lower
Moreland Township, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, in the Court of
Quarter Sessions, Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, June term 1950, was
declared illegal and unconstitutional.
The requirement that subdividers pro-
vide, whenever practicable, for suitable
open spaces for parks, playgrounds,
and rccrcational areas was deemed to
be “taking of the land without com-
pensation.”

o ACCORDING TO A REPORT made at
the tcnth annual meeting of the Asso-
ciation of Southeastern State Park
Directors, the total of apprOpriations
for thc operation and maintenance of
state parks in the southeastern states
was almost two and one-half million
dollars for the fiscal year 1950-51. For
the same year, total appropriations for
capital improvements in the same area
werc over four and one-half million
dollars. The report also indicates that
attendance at state parks in southeast-
ern United States exceeded fourteen
and one-half million dollars last year.
Joseph F. Kaylor, director of forests
and parks, Maryland, was elected presi-
dent of the association, succeeding
James L. Segrest of Alabama. C. West

IT MAY BE the middle of winter, with the
snow swirling and the warmth of summer

W seemingly unattainable, but this is the month

of the National Motor Boat Show. All hands
flock to come aboard at Grand Central Palace, in New
York City, to see the new crop of crafts and the accom-
panying myriad gadgets. Truly, spring is just around the
corner and the warm salt spray not so unattainable after
all. Recreational boating is rapidly becoming everybody’s
business.

Today a modestly-budgeted income is no reason for
members of a family to sit on the beach when they would
rather be out in a boat on the waters of the lake, river,
sound or ocean. Modern production methods have brought
the cost of boats and their accessories within the reach of
all. The healthful, fun-filled recreation found in cruising,
racing or fishing with power ‘or sail can be yours for
very little with such developments as the use of plastic
and molded plywood and the ready-to-build “knockdown
kits.” It also can be within reach of the community rec-
reation department budget.

Pioneered in the days before the second World War

by a few boat builders and now offered by most makers
of small sail and power boats, the “knockdown kits” have
shaved the cost of a “ready-to-sail” boat, finished com-
pletely by the builder, by as much as seventy-five per

426

cent in many cases. Whether you want a sturdy little out-
board to take the pounding of the rough waters off a
rocky point while trolling for “king” striper or a fast,
safe sailboat, you will find it worthwhile to look into the
matter carefully.

These sub-assembled kits, complete with plans and full
instructions as to materials to be used, are readily availa-
ble. Also, in most of the monthly boating magazines, there
are plans for building your own boat right from the keel
up. The latter takes a good deal of shipwright’s skill—
more so than the “knockdowns,” which can be put to-
gether with simple hand tools in a cellar or garage dur-
ing the long winter months.

Development of the use of plastic for boat hulls has
cut the cost greatly, both in the decreased Original price
of a similar wooden craft and more especially in the main-
tenance. One New England boatbuilder turns out small
plastic craft which never need that annual spring coat
of paint. This is a great saving in money, time and el-
bow grease when it comes to “wooding” before applying
the new paint. This yard claims that the molded-plastic
hull completely prevents leakage and does away with the
necessity of caulking, as there are no seams.

With the lowering of costs throughout the boating
world, there also has come a tremendous increase in sea-
worthiness and safety for young and old alike. Outboard
motors have become less complicated to run and the boats
are built along faster, yet safer, lines. The day of the
round-bottom skiff has given way to the safer vee-bottom
boats of today, and even the small eight- and ten-foot
prams are relatively stable craft. In sailboats, the incor-
poration of permanent backstays and long-luffed, short-
footed sails makes for easier handling and greater effi-
ciency, while the vee-bottom hull with heavy, metal center-
boards vastly lessens the chances of “shipping green watcr
to leeward.”

All this has made for a great increase in sailing activi-

ty by the youngsters. All over the country, groups of
various kinds are sponsoring junior sailing programs to
teach boys and girls the respect of, and mastery over, the
water. As most authorities concur, children should begin
their acquaintance with it in a “shore school” conducted
by a responsible person who knows the ways of water.
Here the child learns the nomenclature and principles be-
hind sailing and the invaluable art of knot-tying as well
as the pr0per situation for each of the several basic nautical
knots. Here, too, he learns the rules of the road and is
taught how to recognize all the standard government aids
to navigation—buoys, lights and horns.

This could make an excellent project for local rec-
reation departments—in community centers or on play-
grounds—and could be handled by a skilled volunteer who
is seasoned in, and enthusiastic about, such matters. It
can form the basis of a boating program as a year-round
recreation activity, if the community is fortunate enough
to be within reach of water and thus able to carry for-
ward these learned skills into the actual boating situation.
When considering such a program, it is important to re-
member, too, that boating is one of those interests and
activities which carry over into adult life and, later, into
retirement years. '

Once in the boats, the youngsters learn, under the guid-
ance of the instructor, how to put their “blackboard work”
into practice. Only after a good deal of experience are
they allowed to race-—and then only in the protected wa-
ter of the inner bay or cove. Starting at an early age and
practicing as much as possible, the youngster will find
that in a few years he is allowed to race against those
older and more experienced than he; and, if he has shown
a real interest in his basic grounding and has learned
the lessons taught, he has a good chance of winning that
Saturday race or even the season’s series and collect a prize

or two at the end of the summer.

In a recent report on the Larchmont Race Week, held
last summer, it was noted that on Junior Day, set aside for
all those under eighteen years of age, a record number
of crews turned out for competition. One hundred twenty-
eight boats set a record for that event. This is quite typi-
cal of the great increase in sailing interest exhibited by
youngsters.

The annual culmination of the many junior sailing pro-

 

Outboard runabout takes family for Sunday spin, trolling for
the wily 6311 or competing against other runabouts in a race.

grams each year is the competition for the Sears’ Cup,
emblem of the North American junior sailing champion-
ship. Open to those who have not reached their eighteenth
birthday by September 1 of the year in which they com-
pete, the Sears’ finals include regional winners from sec-
tions of the East Coast, the Great Lakes and other parts

of the continent, who signify their intention to enter
crews.

This year’s finals were held off Marblehead, Massachu-
setts, under the auspices of the Pleon Yacht Club, last
year’s winner, and included eight crews. The winners,

427

representatives of the Rocky Point Yacht Club, Green-
wich, Connecticut, included two fifteen-year-olds and a
fourteen-year-old. The skipper of the four-man crew on
the winning craft was seventeen-year-old George Reich-
helm. Othcr contestants were as young as thirteen. and all
competitors sailed International 210 sloops, ovcr twenty-
five feet long.

In addition to these junior sailing programs at yacht
cluhs, scouting organizations all over the country arc train-
ing their boys and girls in the ways of thc water. In the
postwar years, cnrollment in the Sca Scouts, the nautical
programs of the Boy and Girl Scouts and the Junior Mari-
ner programs has zoomed.

Junior interest in these many sailing programs has
been equalled by the increased adult participation in thc
outboard motorboatng fraternity. Not only are the smallcr
outboards used for day runs and racing, but designers and
builders have come up with a new creation—the out-
board cruiser. The latter has gained greatly in popularity
since the end of the war.

The inboard cruiser, which can be purchased complete
or in the less expensive “knockdown” form, provides
modest cruising facilities, coupled with light diSplacement
for easier trailer transportation and the much-Iess-expcn-
sive outboard motor power. Speeds up to twenty miles an
hour can be obtained from motors ranging from ten to
twenty-five horsepower, proving amplc for relaxed, safc
cruising.

As for racing the outboard, great stridcs have been
made to bring this exciting and highly competitive sport
within the reach of those in the lower income bracket.
Since the war, the stock utility classes have become popu-
Iar because their rules say that the boats must be raccd
with motors just as they come from the dealers’ shclves,
without any added, costly “souping up” process allowcd.
Before the war, the Albany-to-New-York annual race was
for outboard hydroplanes and runabouts; but, since the
war, competition has been restricted to stock utility boats,
with the entry list nearing three hundred boats for one
race.

Also, inboard racing classes have grown up since the
war, limiting the amount of money spent on engines. More
boats now compete with the assurance that they are not
merely practicing against more expensive boats which
would normally win the race handily. Division II of the
225-cubic-inch hydroplane class was formed and limits total
cash outlay for the engine installed to six hundred dollars,
less than half the expense allowed in Division I. Other
classes, limiting the motors to stock varieties, include the
Pacific One Design Hydroplanes and the pending 136-
cubic-inch hydros.

Boating can be fun and at a minimum of cost. Re-
cently, a twenty-two-year-old Gar Wood runabout that had
been salvaged from the bottom of the waters of Manhas-
set Bay, Long Island, and put into commission as a “picnic
and Sunday afternoon cruising” boat won the fifth an-
nual edition of the Harwood Tr0phy Race. This race for
inboard boats, the only one to be run exclusively in thc
waters around Manhattan, is a diliicult one, and has come

motorboating calendar. “Davy Jones,” this year’s winner,

plus three Canadian aces—and still she won in the able
hands of co-owners Jack Kraemer and Bill Lciber, both

BOAT BUILDING

Boat building has bcen a popular activity in some com-
munity recreation crafts shops. However, it docs prescnt
various problems, several of which the Chicago Park Dis-
trict solved some years ago.

It found that some boats occupied space which could
be used to better advantage by more individuals engaged
in other activities, and that many of the large boats had
never been completed or had taken two or three years to
reach a stage that would permit rcmoval from the shOp.

T hereforc, the following policy was evolved for all crafts
shops:

1. Sixtecn feet is the maximum length of any boat pcr-
mitted to he built in any park crafts or boat shop. The

maximum beam is determined by the width of openings
at the location.

2. Where structural conditions of buildings are such as
to prohibit the building of any sixteen-foot boat, the maxi-
mum length is determined by such limitations. In no case
will a doorway or portal of any kind be enlarged.

Among the sailboats that come within the above limita-
tions are classcs known as Comet, Snipe, Pelican, four-
tecn-foot International Dinghy, Penguin, Class B Dinghy,
Moth and Frostbite. Innumerablc types of power boats,
canoes, rowboats and kayaks also fall within the limita-
tions set by the Chicago Park District.

AMERICAN MUSIC for Music Week

 

EVERY WEEK really

is a music week, and
every music week ought to be an
American music week! Especially in
our schools and colleges ought we to
demonstrate, at least during our an-
nual music week, that this country
does have skilled and capable'com-
posers and that they do produce music
that can be performed by students and
enjoyed by the general public. Here-
in are suggested some aids toward
this end.

\Vhat Is American Music?

First of all, we should understand
what we mean by American music. We
are not concerned here with our so-
called “popular” music. Not that it
isn’t music, or American, or isn’t good
in its kind, but we are talking about
American music on the same basis of
skill and substance that Europeans ap-
ply to the music of their recognized
composers. We are concerned with the
American counterparts of Stravinsky
and Sibclius, Hindemith and Prokofieff
——the men who practice the art and
craft of music in the tradition of the

great masters. Those are the men who,
unfortunately, do not become “popu-
lar”——any more than do the ac-
knowledged titans of the past, such as
Bach, Beethoven and Brahms.

But do we have any so-called “seri-

Dr. l’hilip Gordon has long been active
in seeking to establish a meeting ground
between the American composer and Ameri-
can youth. The author of The Availability
of Contemporary American Music for Per-
forming Croups, he has also contributed
articles to leading educational journals, been
national vicevchairman of the Committee on
Contemporary Music of the Music Educa-
tors National Conference, and has held pro-
fessorships at Chicago Musical College and
Seton Hall University.—-T. E. Rivers, Secre-
tary, National Music Week Committee.

ous” composers? The American pub-

lic never has become conscious of the
number of people in this country ac-
tually composing music in 3 crafts-
manlike manner. Five years ago, Claire
Reis, in her Composers in America,
named about 750 such composers. She
indexed some 6,500 works by approxi-
mately 330 of these composers.

We do not feel the impact of this
large, constantly growing body of
American music because most of it re-
mains in manuscript form. At best,
only thirty per cent of all of this music
is published. The fact remains, there-
fore, that there is a great deal morc
American music than we imagine, and
each year brings a greater increase.

Is It Usable?

Published American music is avail-
ablc for all sorts of performing me-
(liums, and in varying degrees of dilli-
culty. It is possible to obtain composi-
tions in many forms, large and small,
for band, orchestra, chorus of mixed,
female or male voices, as well as for
string quartets, wood-wind chamber
music, instrumental and vocal solos
and works for the stage.

Grades of diHiculty vary from fairly
easy writing intended for students to
highly complex scores for symphonic
musicians. There is enough American
music available on the high school
level to meet the requirements of many
student and non-school amateur
groups. High school organizations in
this country have performed Roy Har-

ris’ Third Symphony, Aaron C0pland’s

Lincoln Portrait, and Randall Thomp-
son’s Testament of Freedom. At the
other end of the scale there are choral
and instrumental works by American

National Music Week al-
ways begins on the first
Sunday in May. This year,
it will be celebrated from
May 4 to 11. It is not too
early to make plans for
programs which will mark
the occasion and serve as
a highlight of the year’s
work in music as well as a
focus of attention upon the
needs for future musical
development.

 

composers which can be given by
junior high school pupils.

Contrary to what some may think
about twentieth century music, most
American compositions are not esoteric
or unapproachable. American music
tcnds to be tuneful, transparent, rhyth-
mically alive and often has a flavor of
indigenous folk song and dance. The
present century being an age of ex-
perimentation, it is natural that Ameri-
can composers, like European, should
take cognizance of the great expansions
which have been made in harmony,
counterpoint and other elements of
musical structure and organization. On
the whole, however, our composers are
“modern” with reservations, perhaps
because the musical taste of the Ameri-
can public is highly conservative.

How Does One Find Suitable
Music?

Perhaps the greatest diHiculty con-
nected with a program of American
music is not in the performing of it,
but in the finding of it. The best known

429

Alnerican composers do write a good
deal that is difficult to perform.

In the case of standard classics, with
which teachers and group leaders be-
come more or less familiar in their
student days, it is easy enough to
know those which make too great a
demand upon voices, or those which
require prohibitive orchestral vir-
tuosity. But we hear so little modern
American music, and it is repeated so
infrequently, that few leaders have an
opportunity to become really conver-
sant with the repertory.

Least in need of any guide to play-
able contemporary American works
will be the directors of school and col-
lege bands. The concert band is a
twentieth century creation. In Ameri-
ca, the word “band” is practically
synonymous with “student band” or
“community band.” The repertory
specifically composed for bands is al-
most entirely a product of the last
quarter of a century—and almost en-
tirely the work of American com-
posers. More and more American band
compositions of excellent quality are
being published. Publishers’ catalogues
and music dealers’ shelves reveal re-
warding works by such men—to name
only a few—as Aaron C0pland, Roy
Harris, Ray Green, Henry Cowell,
Robert Sanders, Burnett Tuthill, Paul

Creston and William Schuman.

The selection of choral music pre-
sents some problems. In addition to
the usual questions about the range of
voices and the difficulty of the tessi-

tura, one has to consider such matters.

as the source and nature of the text,
the length of the composition, the
presence or absence of accompaniment
and its nature if it is present, the de-
mands made upon solo voices—if any
are required. These questions are not
usually answered by publishers’ cata-
logues, and it would be a tedious job
to examine all the choral music by
American composers that can bc
found on dealers’ shelves.

The Music Educators National Con-
ference has made an important con-
tribution by preparing a list of recom-
mended contemporary music, princi-
pally by Americans, for band, orches-
tra and chorus. The original list, he-
gun in 1944 by a committee headed
by Dr. Howard A. Murphy and ex-

430

tended to 1948 under the chairman-

ship of Dr. George Howerton, is availa-
blc in mimeographed form.‘ Recently,
a committee, under the chairmanship
of the present author, revised and ex-
tended the list to 1951 and graded all
thc numbers as to difEculty.

Further aid in the selection of suita-
ble choral numbers is obtainable from
those journals which review and
evaluate new compositions. Among
them are the Music Educators Journal,

. Educational Music Magazine, Musical

America, Notes and the Music Clubs
Magazine.

American choral music of the
highest quality already has begun to
establish itself as a definite part of the
school, college and community group
repertory. Such numbers as Randall
Thompson’s Alleluiah, Normand Lock-
wood’s Monotone, and William Schu-
man’s Prelude for Voices frequently

appear upon concert programs. Impor-
tant contributions have been made by

Henry Cowell, Gardner Read, Irving
Fine, Virgil Thomson, Harl McDon-
ald, Richard Donovan, Douglas Moore,
Burrill Philips, David Diamond, Samu-
el Barber and Peter Mennin. Almost
any kind of choral composition can
be obtained—from Copland’s simple
Younger Generation, for s0prano and
alto, to Lockwood’s David Mourneth
for Absalom, for eight parts a cap-
pella, or Thompson’s elaborate, but
resounding, choral cantata, The Peace-
able Kingdom.

It is worth observing that much of
the verse used by American composers
is taken from the poetry of Walt
Whitman.

The most difficult problem will be
the selection of American music that
can be played by an amateur orchcstra.
The decline in non-professional or-
chestral playing in the last twenty
years has been sad and regrettable.
Because of this situation, our com-
posers have given little thought to
writing music suitable for school and
community orchestras. Their works
tcnd to make severe technical demands
upon the players. Nevertheless, there
is a fair number of American com-
positions which a reasonably compc-
tent amateur orchestra can perform.

*Also published in this author’s Contempo-
rary American Music for Performing Groups.

The recommended lists and othcr
sources previously mentioned will be
helpful. It is particularly important to
know whether a work is published in
such form that it can be played by
orchestras with incompletc instrumcn-
tation. For example, the slow move-
mcnt of Howard Hanson’s Romantic
Symphony, a beautiful and not very
diIIicult piece of music, can be used
only by a fully-equipped orchestra,
since there is no piano accompani-
ment to replace the instruments which
may be missing.

Among contemporary American com-

positions which may be considered
suitable for the average amatcur or-
chestra are: William Bergsma’s Paul
Bunyan Suite, most of William Schu-
1nan’s N ewsreel, Harl McDonald’s Leg-
end of the Arkansas Traveler, all but
the first movement of Aaron C0pland’s
“Rodeo” Suite, the same composer’s
Outdoor Overture, Virgil Thomson’s
suite from the music to the documen-
tary film, The Plow that Broke the
Plains, the same composer’s recently-
published Acadian Songs and Dances
from his music to the film, Louisiana
Story, and certain movements from Elie
Siegmeister’s Western Suite and Ozark

Set.
What Can We Do for Music \Veek?

Large or small, superior or just
average, every non-professional music
organization can perform some modern
American music of high quality dur-
ing Music Week, making the com-
munity conscious of the important con-
tribution to Ammican life that is being
made by the composer in our midst.

While we are at it, let us seek out
the composer who actually is in our
midst—in our own state, in our own
city. Most of our composers do not
live in the clouds or in an ivory tower;
they do not scorn the common multi-
tude. Like the rest of us, they have a
warm affection for children. Such mcn
as Randall Thompson, Elic Siegmeis-
ter, Norman Gould, Ray Green, chry
Cowell and Aaron COpland have either
gone directly into t11c schools to work
with the students as “fellow musicians”
or have had direct musical contacts
with young pe0ple in other ways. Dur-
ing Music Week, we can seek to es-

RECREATION

tablish closer relationships with the
composers who happen to live near
us by inviting them to attend and par-
ticipate in our Music Week concerts.

We can commission a composer liv-
ing in our state or in our city to write
a composition for our particular cho-
rus, band or orchestra—a composition
intended specifically to mark our con-
tribution to Music Week. No worthy
composer will scorn such a commis-

sion. A good composer is not disturbed
by the need to write for performers
of less than professional skill. He is
only disturbed when his music is ig-
nored by his countrymen.

These are only a few indications of
what we can do about American music
during Music Week. Everyone can
think of other suggestions for his own
community. The important thing is to
do something concrete and constructive

to help the community develop a bet-
tcr understanding of what our com-
posers are writing and of how their
music sounds. It is not necessary to
plan lengthy programs or to seek out
difficult compositions. There is plenty
of good, usable music available from
tho pcns of sincere, skilled American
composers. Let the performance of
some of this music be our special
project for Music Week this year.

THE BOYS WERE so completely
fascinated that they never moved from
their seats for the whole three hours.
How grateful I am that our children
have the opportunity of attending the
opera.” So ran one of the many let-
ters of gratitude that Hood the Metro-
politan Opera Guild office in New
York, after each of its student per-
formances. In the last fifteen years,
there have been sixty of these special
matinees of grand Opera attended by
more than two hundred thousand en-
thusiastic children.

At first the Guild—the architect of
the student performance plan—was
spurred to action by the desire to take
a hand in the musical education of
tomorrow’s audience. It builded better
than it knew. Instead of finding listen-
ing to opera a duty to be performed,
junior audiences have discovered that
it can be recreation in the finest sense.
Productions of seventeen difiercnt op-
eras have run from Aida and Lohen-
grin to The Bartered Bride, and Met-
ropolitan casts of standard excellence
have taken part every time. Students
of junior and senior high schools at-
tend these performances as a privilege
of group membership in the Opera
Guild. Each school undertakes to pay
ten dollars in annual dues, which en-
titles it to twenty-four issues of Opera
News. The students may then purchase
their tickets at greatly-reduced rates,
thereby largely clearing away the
financial barrier to opcra as recreation.
To finance the project, the Guild looks
for underwriting to its individual
members, friends who enjoy opera so
much they wish to share it with the
future opera lovers. At present, 350
member schools profit by this gener-

osity-—not only in New York City, but
in Westchester County, Long Island,
Connecticut, New Jersey, and in far-
ther-removed communities. Girls and
boys from Catskill High School, for
instance, traveled three hundred miles
in one day to attend a single perform-
ance.

Thus student performances serve as
the ground upon which opera is to be
built as recreation. The foundation of
the structure is preparation for attend-
ing the performances. When the Guild
accepts a group membership,the music
supervisor in the school agrees to con-
duct several sessions on the Opera’s
background. Those students who will
attend the performance form the nu-
cleus of the session. Occasionally, an
entire school assembly is devoted to
the topic. In turn, the Guild provides
the supervisor with a syllabus of notes,
references and informal dramatic ma-
terial.

Upon this foundation, we see the
building rise almost as if by its own
power. First tangible evidence of conta-
gious enjoyment on a large scale came
from Student Council. Representatives
from the member schools in the five
geographically-divided regions unani-
mously joined forces some eight years
ago and now meet regularly as an 0p-
era council in their respective areas.
The elected officers from each region
likewise assemble to form the Executive
Committee of the Student Council. It
is this student group which, with the
ever-present help of the Guild, raises
the edifice into the ideal structures—-
opera which offers education, inspira-
tion and recreation to students of all

departments. Art contests, musicales,
radio programs and debates are all to
be found among the bricks and mortar.

Art contestants from each region
submit costume and stage setting de-
signs based Upon the current student
performance operas; the winning re-
gional entries compete in the finals
and prizes are awarded at the Metro-
politan Opera House. For the second
outstanding activity—the musicale in
the separate regions—students are
auditioned and those who are selected
to perform have the thrill of appear-
ing upon the same stage with a guest
artist.

Is this building program successful?
Much evidence indicates that it is. Re-
cently, past members of the Student
Council organized an alumni group,
fired by the spontaneous ambition to
carry on the ideals established by the
Opera Guild. They have built their own
house, based Upon education in Opera,
and are now equipped to utilize its
recreation possibilities.

Recreation in opera, of course, is
limited neither to the younger genera-
tion nor to those who can afford fre-
quent opera attendance. An estimated
fifteen million people find pleasure in
listening to the Saturday broadcasts
from the stage of the Metropolitan Op-
era House throughout the opera sea-
son.

The Opera Guild can well be proud
of the progress of its plan and h0peful
for its future. The cornerstone has
bcen securely laid; the audience of to-
morrow has accepted opera as recrea-
tion—and still the building expands to
new and happy usefulness.

BECBEATION
DIVISION
SERVICES

When the Rccreation Division of the Washington State
Parks and Recreation Commission was activated in May
1949, the state formally recognized that provision for lei-
sure-time activity had become a governmental function and
that the state had a responsibility in acting as guide and
assistant to local communities where primary responsi-
bility for recreation rests. The state recognized further
that, if the people are prepared to use their leisure time
constructively, and are provided with the facilities and
leadership through which their individual interests can be
satisfied, both state and community are fostering a rich
democratic asset.

Considerable thinking on the worth of a state recrea-
tion agency had been done before the law was passed cre-
ating the division as part of the statc parks and recrea-
tion commission. This thinking, by citizens who pay the
bill, was extremely important then, and has continued as
the motivating force in the conduct of the division.

The division operates upon thrce fundamental concepts:

432

Dr. Frank F. \Varrcn

(1) Rccrcation is a community nced for which facilitics
and leadcrship should be provided, just as for cducation
and health. (2) Recreation is a function of government,
just as are public works and safcty. A city is no longcr
run without a city cngineer or a health officer; it scems
reasonable then to employ a director to take carc of mu-
nicipal recreation. (3) Recreation is of public concern;
therefore, it is the responsibility of local government to
provide facilities and leadership and to encouragc co-
operative effort by both public and private agencies in thc
sponsorship or conduct of a recreation program.

The average citizen is becoming more interestcd in
worthwhile leisure-time activity in which he and his family
can participate in his home community. He is seeking
aid in satisfying that need, and appreciates a state scrvicc
that can supply him with information about what other
communities are doing or that will assist him with thc
solution of the local recreation problem. He is secking
adequate, trained lcaders; he wants to know what kind
of facilities his town should build and maintain. In all of

these, the statc services of thc recreation division arc usc-
ful to him.

A legislative act in 1947 abolished the old State Parks
Committcc and established thc Statc Parks and Recrea-
tion Commission with two divisions, onc for parks and
one for rccrcation. A commission of seven, appointed by
thc Governor, was provided by the act. As now constituted,
the commission has sevcn lay members from various parts
of the state.

The recreation division was not activated until May
1949. \Vhen it was set up, a subcommittec on recreation
within thc commission was appointed by the chairman to
handle public relations as related to recreation. Mrs. Ruth
E. Peeler, vice chairman of thc commission, has scrved
as chairman of that subcommittee during the cntire pe-
riod. At the present time, other commissioners on her
committec arc Arthur H. Morgan of Walla Walla and
Emil H. Miller of Wenatchee. These members are often
called upon to meet with local or state groups intercsted
in recreation, and the chairman of this commission’s sub-
committee traveled widely, the first year, throughout thc
state in the interests of recreation. During 1949, she
talked with thirty-six different groups on local problems,
some of them combined park and recreation problems.

The policy of the committee and of the personncl of
the division is to seek maximum lay participation on the
local level, both in planning and in the execution of rcc-
reation programs, public and private. The Washington
Statc Advisory Committee on Camping and the Washing-
ton State Recreation Council, with professional and lay
mcmbership, both act as sounding boards to determine
sentiment and to provide a mcdium for common discus-

sion of problems with each other and with division staff
members.

The reereation division now has three professional staff
members, headed by William B. Pond, who came to the
organization at the time of its activation. Its activities
are many and varied. Staff members have made more
than two hundred visits to eighty different communities
in the two-year interval since the division was organized.
They assist in the solution of all kinds of recreation prob-
lems——finance, program, leadership, facilities——and particu-
larly stress coordination of community activities by both
public and private agencies. They have also participated in
twenty—five institutes and conferences, some of which were
division-sponsored while others were in cooperation with
other state or local agencies.

Division personnel are always available to assist in the
training of leadership upon request. The division, how-
ever, conducts no programs and has no funds for direct
allocation to communities. It never eneroaehes upon the
exclusive authority of the community in the management
and control of programs. It is, instead, a source of infor-
mation for local communities, a reservoir of leadership,
and a research agency for the multitude of recreation
problems which face communities in accepting their re-
sponsibility for providing worthwhile recreation activities
for all of the people, regardless of sex, race, age or eco-
nomic status. It encourages local problems of voluntary
organizations and promotes cooperative activities between
public and private agencies.

When planning a field visit, the usual procedure is for
one of the specialists to make a visit to an area after the
division has received a request for service from some local
person or organization. The visit may be for a talk to
an interested organization; it may be a preliminary, ex-
ploratory meeting with representatives of several organi-
zations and local leaders to discuss problems and ways of
solving them; it may be a gathering of representatives of

all groups in the city, either supporting or operating a
recreation program, for the purpose of organizing a co-
ordinatng council; or, it may be for the purpose of giving

first-hand assistance to paid community recreation per-
sonnel.

Not all assistance, however, is given through field visits.
Special research projects are often conducted by the di-
vision as a result of requests. For example, a recent publi-
cation on how families can play together was prepared
in response to repeated requests for such information. This
booklet stresses summertime activities and backyard play
equipment. A second publication, now in preparation, deals
with wintertimc activities in the home. Another. publica-
tion, just off the press, is a report of a survey of organized
camping in the state of Washington. In this survey, the
division was aided by the Washington State Advisory
Committee on Camping.

Many communities have become interested in organizing
community councils or in establishing municipal park
boards or advisory committees on recreation needs, pre-
liminary to expanding their programs. One such survey
is just getting under way, in which the recreation depart-
ment of the University of Washington will be cooperating
with the division in a survey of a community of 33,800.
W. H. Shumard, northwest district representative of the
National Recreation Association, also will assist in this
project, and the Bureau of Governmental Research and
Services at the university also has been requested to serve
in an advisory capacity on certain phases of the survey.
This bureau has already assisted the division in the com-
pilation of sample ordinances creating park boards in
second, third and fourth class municipalities, and in the
compilation of applicable state laws relating to park boards
for metropolitan park districts and for cities of all classes.

Annually, the University of Washington sponsors an
Institute of Government, under the direction of the bureau.
The purpose of the institute is to bring together Washing-

433

ton citizens interested in discussing problems of state and
local government. Last year, for the second time, a day-
long discussion of public recreation was included on the
program, providing an opportunity for the consideration
of problems of budgeting and of the effect of civilian dc-
fense and military personnel needs upon present connnunity
programs. Mrs. Ruth E. Peeler served as chairman of the
recreation section and also as a member of the advisory
committee of the institute. Co-sponsors with the bureau and
the recreation division were the National Recreation As-
sociation, the Washington State Rccreation Society and the
Washington State Recreation Council.

Last spring, the division cooperated with local groups in
leadership training institutes in five widely-scattered areas
of the state——Spokane, Yakima, Swauk picnic area near
Ellensburg, Kitsap County Recreation Institute at Bremer-
ton and Camp Seymour near Tacoma. In each institute,
local leadership took the initiative, with division personnel
assisting wherever local leaders thought that they could
best serve. The division also has assisted with three one-
day hospital recreation conferences, one of which it co-
sponsored for the Veterans Administration Hospital at
American Lake near Tacoma. A second institute was spon-
sored by the VA at its Walla Walla Hospital. The third,
held at Fort Steilacoom, one of the state’s mental hospitals,
brought together all recreation directors from institutions
under the state division, and included custodial and train-
ing schools, mental hospitals, penal institutions and sol-
diers’ homes.

The division has assisted a large number of communities
in planning facilities, suggesting kinds and placement of
facilities and encouraging each of them to adapt the sug-
gestions to fit the local needs. The achievement of one of
the communities thus aided is pictured in this article. In
the early spring, the division went into Port Angeles, upon
the request of the local Elks, to look over a piece of school
land available for the Port Angeles playfield. The com-
pleted project, financed entirely by the Elks, was dedicated
and presented to the city at a special ceremony in June.

Because the division is so closely connected with state
parks, camping has been stressed—with special emphasis
upon group camp planning and the interpretation of camp-
ing to the public. Services in camping, however, are not
confined to state parks. Mention already has been made of
the Washington State Advisory Committee on Camping,
which the division serves as secretary. The division has
assisted communities with pilot school camping projects
and has coordinated the use of camps throughout the state.
It has carried on a prOgram of public education regarding
camping, studied and encouraged new forms of camping
for different groups—-——adults, crippled children, senior citi-
zens and family groups—seeking to promote higher can1p-
ing standards in general.

Other state park recreation activities have included re-
sponsibility for the employment of qualified waterfront
personnel for ten Washington state parks having swim-
ming facilities. The division also has prepared two folders
--—one for distribution to school children Visiting Feder-
ated Forest State Park, which preserves an exhibit of virgin

tions. Members also served as leaders at thc Covcrnor’s
Conference, held in Seattle in December 1950, after the
President’s White House Conference in Washington, D. C.

For example, they have been consultants 011 parks and rec-

tion of Washington Cities. They also have participated in
a curriculum planning conference at Washington State
College, Pullman, during the spring of 1951, where the
School of Physical Education had just been authorized to
offer both bachelors and masters degrees in recreation.
During the summer, they often appeared on local radio
programs. In addition, library loans are a continuous serv-
ice of the division.

stead of giving it handouts from the kitchen, provides
unlimited challenge. The state of Washington, like many
other states, has citizens who view this younger member of
the family with suspicion. When the pressure is on, there
are some who would sacrifice the benefits of worthwhile
leisure-time activity for civic projects of a more materialis-
tic nature. Not all city councils are ready or able to dig
down into their pockets for tax funds to provide a base
for financing a long-range recreation program. However,
citizen sentiment in favor of adequate programs is gaining
strength and, in spite of financial difficulties, many com-
munities are finding ways and means of obtaining the
services which they want and need. It must, of course, be
kept in mind that recreation is only one of many municipal
services and that, while it should have its share, those in-
terested in bettering the programs should recognize over-all
community needs as well.

Additional state legislation is needed to provide com-
munities with the organization necessary for taking care
of community needs in recreation and with a means of
financing programs when the local community wishes to
do so. At present, for example, there is no legal means
whereby persons in the nearby trade area can be taxed
to pay their share toward a public recreation program from
which they benefit. Laws relating to planning for parks
and recreation likewise need to be studied for possible
changes and improvements.

There is need to develop greater understanding between
public and private agencies as to the roles each can play

in a coordinated community program, thus eliminating
duplication and overlapping. There is need to devclop
higher professional standards among recreation workers,
both through a provision for better training and a re-
examination of the philosophy of recreation.

Stress upon participation, based upon individual choice
for purposes of relaxation instead of the development of
high skill of a few selected people in a single activity, is
badly needed in many of our programs. In this, many of
the paid recreation workers themselves are at fault, be-
cause providing a “winning team” becomes more impor-
tant than providing opportunities so that all can play.

Skillful leadership should utilize both youth and adults
as volunteers in all stages of recreation activities—from
planning through actual participation in the activities pro-
vided. Planning should not be spasmodic; it should be
consistent and of the year-round variety. It should be kept
progressive and evolutionary, and should utilize all re-
sources available. Community situations are subject to
change and the recreation program should be able to
change with them. What works one year may not be popu-
lar the next. The paid recreation leader should keep this in
mind and frequently consult the people to learn how they
feel about the operating program. He should then be ready
to change if the occasion seems to warrant this. The leader
should never forget that local citizens are the ones for
whom the program is planned; they should decide upon
what to do, how much to spend, quality of their leaders.

The average American citizen wants to provide for him-
self. lndividual and group participation in planning en-
courages the sharing of ideas and often leads to communi-
ty action. It uncovers areas of need and of duplication and
overlapping. It gives each group an opportunity to decide
how it can contribute most to the total effort. A new
agency should never be started to perform a function for
which some existing agency already is responsible. The
coordinating agency, when formed, should not “take over.”
It should only provide for an avenue of participation and
an opportunity for understanding that will make the total
community offering better. This is the democratic way. The
task of recreation is to foster it——in the conference room,

on the playground, on the playfield and in the family.

Amati/wing 1952 CONGRESS IN SEATTLE

In 1952, the National Recreation Congress, for the first time, moves
into the Northwest—Seattle: September 29 to October 3: Headquarters—

Olympic Hotel.

This announcement, when made in Boston, created great interest and
many requests for further information. In response, a series of articles—

of which the above is the first—will appear during the coming months
to give readers of RECREATION a preview of the significant recreation de-
velopments in that great area of the country. It is important for board
members, executives and volunteers to plan carefully now for what we
all feel will be a very rewarding trip.—T. E. Rivers, Secretary, National
Recreation Congress.

The Place of Parks

in Outdoor Education

and RECREATION

occasionally triumphing over difficulty
or challenge, which the parks serve
with their ski runs, their mountains to
climb, their white waters to shoot in
a canoe? There is the need for getting
off the pavements every so often, to
come again into contact with the earth
and its mysterious healing, and the
parks serve that need with footpaths,
fireplaces and balsam boughs for
sleeping on the ground. They also serve
the need for escape from the war of
nerves into quietude, restoration and
balance, with their forests, thcir birds
and the sound of waves or waterfalls.

Any of those needs could be used
as examples for what I have to say, but
I have chosen, instead, the human need
for, and response to, natural beauty.
1 use it because I suspect that many
of us are somewhat timid about speak-
ing up for that as valiantly as we
would for the need for sports or camp-
ing. Maybe we suffer from a guilt feel-
ing that confessing sensitivity to beau-
ty is to admit an efleminate weakness.

However, this remains one of our
most fundamental human needs. Did
you ever see that old blanketed Indian
on the south rim of Grand Canyon
who made a daily and almost ccre—
menial rite of his reverent apprecia-
tion of each evening’s sunset? No one
could watch him, lost in contemplation
of that evening scene, without realiz-
ing the depth of human hunger for
natural beauty and its serenitieswand
how universal it is in our great human
family. Haven’t you, yourself, looked
around in some cspeeially breathtaking

beauty spot and noted that others, how-
ever many races they might represent,
likewise appeared to look to thc moun-
tains from whence comcth something
of mysterious spiritual help?

Now, what really is the place of
parks in respect to this need? Direct
service to it, in all the different kinds
of parks—in city parks, relieving the
stark ugliness to which urban living
seems so pronc; in outlying parks,
preserving, before it is too late, our
remaining nearby forests; and in the
more remote parks and the deep
woods, protecting for individuals the
opportunity to feel that one has come
home again to the silnplieities of his
childhood and to glimpse, once more,
half-forgotten wildlife; and, finally, in
the great national or state parks, prc-
serving as sanctuaries those natural
resources which are the heritage of all
generations.

Pausing to survey an idea like this,
are we not, as park men, impressed
with the broadness of our field? It
implies that we must keep our think-
ing broad gauged, does it not? Cer-
tainly we may narrow down our atten-
tion, as specialists in city-park service,
forest-preserve service or national-park
service, but we must not narrow our
awareness of the sweeping scope of the
total park movement, of the fact that
we, as trustees, are obliged to make
this great public estate realize its op-
timum public usefulness.

A broad vision needs to become a
constant and dominant attitude, if
parks are to take their rightful place

RECREATION

in providing, to a satisfying percent-
age of the American people, experi-
ences which contribute to outdoor edu-
cation and recreation. We are talking
about a broadmindedness which is
dynamic, not one which is inert. Parks
will assume their full and rightful place
in our national scene only as our
broadmindedness expresses itself in ac-
tion. A park maintenance man must
do something about his conviction that
beauty of scene and orderliness of up-
keep can never be self-fulfilling in a
vacuum, that part of his job lies in
providing for their apprOpriate appre-
ciation and human use.

Reeiprocally, neither will parks as-
sume their full place in outdoor edu-
_eation and recreation until my own
fraternity of recreation specialists cx-
presses its broadminded sense of re-
sponsibility by actively fostering an
understanding of good outdoor citizen-
ship. That means inculcating in others
an appreciation of respect for beauty
and orderliness, a sportsmanship with
a live-and-let-live regard for the life
of growing things, a disciplined re-
gard for the appropriateness of the use
of the public's park estate, all the way
up from a neighborhood playground
to the Yosemite.

My generation has sensed this
breadth of vision, and has pioneered
some of its early patterns of action.
Your generation no doubt will accept
the challenge to carry it beyond any-
thing we have even dreamed.

Roberts Mann, of the forest pre-
serves, and Walter Roy, of Chicago’s
parks, have developed a nature recrea-
tion leader’s training program to bring
to the peeple of their city an under-
standing appreciation of nature as a
field of adventurous exploring, as a
source for design in art and of materi-
als for crafts, as an enriching subject
for study and as an invitation to the
joys of gardening.

Ray Carlson and Garrett Eppley, of
Indiana University, are continually
opening windows which lure students
into the mysteries and delights of 11a-
ture. While teaching recreation courses
there last summer, I found that, in
student public Opinion, its nature of-
ferings were rated in the forefront of
the most popular courses in the whole
university.

City Park Superintendent Bob Ev-

erly goes into partnership with his city
schools to demonstrate that a liberal
education and a broad program of ree-
reation simply do not have separating
boundaries. They intermingle, insepa-
rably. His park service is continually
weaving itself into the education of
Clencoe’s school children. And what
he has done in buying and developing
park land alongside of schoolgrounds,
and in beautifying the school acreage
itself, has demonstrated that the tradi-
tional ugliness of schoolyards is not
necessary but is a failure of imagina-
tion in governing authorities.

The list could be lengthened, but
these are enough to help us see that
just as the place of parks is not in a
vacuum, but addresses itself to human
needs, neither is it static, but keeps
pace with changes in those needs. And
needs do change, as society progresses,
bringing new demands. Examining
them thoughtfully also brings progress

and improvement in service.

The past century in parks at first
brought samples of woodlands to the

city, like museum pieces; patches of

gardeners. Your influence may even
make solariums a commonplace feature
of the home. No doubt, you will lift
the level of public taste for, and appre-
ciation of, shaded streets and the land-
scaping of private grounds. You will
make better use than we of lay enthu-
siasm and capacity to organize, al-
ready evident in “garden groups,”
“dahlia clubs” or local “improvement
associations” and other similar feder-
ations. Growing morc expert in the
public relations art of inspiring and
then channeling enthusiasms, behind
the scenes, you will constructively en-
list the pooling of citizen effort to go
on from where government effort ends
in community beautification. For ex-
ample, I think that you will make it a
park function to inspire neighborhood
projects of community planning of
home beautification, instead of the
present raggedness in unrelated indi-
vidual residential deveIOpment. And
broadening that base, I think you will
interest yourselves in stimulating fami-
ly and neighbor outdoor recreation,
close to the home, to add richer mean-

there an imitation waterfall in some
monstrously ugly fountain. These early

doubt will carry on to such eventual
garden cities as we cannot even
imagine.

As city park specialists, you prob-
ably will discover better ways of mak-
ing your knowledge available to home

ing to the picnic idea and the general
tone of urban neighborliness. I would
expect you to go way out beyond our
present scope in day-camp develop-
ments; also, in short, to consider the
playground and the areas for sports
the mere beginnings, not the ends,
of a park service in recreation.

I would even prephesy that you will
team up with educators to get nature
awareness and appreciation effectively
into the accepted program of cultural
education in our public schools, not

as another “subject” to be studied, but,
perhaps, as projects for small groups
going out from the schoolroom on ad-
venturous exploring trips.

The present momentums in park
trends will carry your generation into
preparing your acres for, and then or-
ganizing, vastly more of outdoor liv-
ing—camping, caravans of companion-
ate group travel in congenial parties
of fellow pilgrims for school groups,
church groups, youth agency groups,
youth hosteling trips. Remember that
our whole rising generation has had at
least some introduction to outdoor liv-
ing in military training camps, and

that national park uses are skyrocket-
ing upward, plainly forecasting what
is to come. Skiing is our fastest grow-
ing sport. That is significant in a so-
ciety where we proclaim that the ma-
jority rules. 50 is the fact that the
greatest single body of sportsmen in
the world undoubtedly is the fraternity
of fishermen. Those implications will
be unfinished business for you in the
future.

IT’S A
COLD DAY FOR HIKING

IN WINTER, animals put on a heavier fur coat. What do

you do? Here are useful pointers to help you in your
preparation for those winter hiking or camping expedi-
tions. Try them and be comfortable.

CLOTHING

1. Wear layers of wool clothing, not heavy or bulky, but
loose fitting and never snug. Use only all-wool garments
and avoid the fuzzy variety.
2. Have outer clothing that is water-repellent, windproof.
3. Wear two-piece long underwear in camp, but not on
the trail.
4. Peel off some layers of clothing when hiking or climb-
ing, to avoid becoming overheated. When stopping for
lunch on a summit or at camp, put on extra clothing.
5. Always use mittens, never gloves, and have a change
with you.
6. Wear an ear-covering hat or hood.
7. Bring pacs, or arctics improvised as pacs, in addition to
ski boots. Both should be roomy and worn with three pairs
of wool socks.
8. Use preventive items, such as chapstick, vaseline and sun
goggles.
9. Brush the snow off one another at all times.
10. Put on a fresh, dry pair of wool socks and under-
garments before getting into a sleeping bag. Place jackets
under sleeping bag when resting.
11. Carry the necessary survival and personal necessity
items on all trail trips.
12. Change any wet clothing immediately.
13. Have a place for everything and keep it there.
14. Keep pack light with everything inside.
15. Use a checklist for your equipment to make sure that
nothing is left behind.

PRECAUTIONS
1. Be in good physical condition; know your limitations.
2. Always check the ice on the lake, stream or pond before
crossing. The last hiker should carry a rope.
3. Loosen binding of snowshoes and skis when crossing a
broad piece of water.
4. Review first aid, especially on frostbite, and check your
ice rescue techniques. Always check for frostbite.
5. Bring along a small bow saw and an axe.
6. .Always split wood to insure burning. Do not usc a cold
axe as the bit will chip easily.
7. Everything freezes, hardens or becomes cold, so be sure
to protect as much as possible, especially those items of
wearing apparel which will be affected. Boots should be
covered.
8. Practice building a fire in snow. Clear the snow and
build a base of logs.
9. Always watch the weather and never climb if a storm
threatens.
10. Never have less than three and, if possible, four in
your party.
11. Remember signs on your trail or mark them. Snow
covers prints quickly.
12. Make an early start; daylight is limited.
13. Do dishes immediately and always keep water in pots
on the fire. Do not keep drinking water over night in any
container.
14. Keep food protected from animals.
15. Include many proteins in menu.
16. If base camping, gather more wood (hard) than you
need for the full time on the first day and shelter it.
17. Never wait until dark to stop hiking and sct up camp.
Do it at least an hour and a half before sunsct.
18. If using skis on a mountain climb, attach an extra strap
to your boot from the ski (arlberg strap).
19. If you fall, when using skis, fill in your sitzmark (hole).
Break a good ski trail as you go.
20. Heed the cry “track” immediately.
21. Use snowshoes—they are bctter in thickly-wooded arcas
and for pulling loads. They take less time to master.
22. Do not hurry on the trail. Kecp to the speed of the
slowest hiker. Keep several feet apart, especially on skis.

TOBOGGANING is where you build it

DETROIT BUILDS HILLS. It COD-

b Where there is an old dump, the city
\ ‘ makes a toboggan slide. Where there
' . is an abandoned reservoir, the city
\ piles up a hill for sledding and ski-

Detroit’s East Side, unfortunately,
just wasn’t around when they were passing out toboggan
slides. lts topography was like the roof of an automobile
factory; while youngsters on the West Side had the roll-
ing valley of the Roguc River. For years they had been
whizzing down six slick-iced chutes at Rouge Park and
two at Redford golf course. East Side youngsters took
belly-Hoppers down driveways.

Three years ago, however, the city’s department of parks
and recreation moved into the East Side with bulldozers
and thousands of cubic yards of dirt. At Warren-Canyon
Park alone, nearly two hundred thousand cubic yards were
spilled. Then the bulldozers backed and filled, strained
and grunted, until there was a lopsided hill, with its long
slope extending almost due north.

During one winter season, the hill was allowed to settle.
1n the spring, tough resilient fescue grass was planted on
the forward slope. Giant mechanical clams riprapped huge
boulders into the steep rear slope. City foresters completed
the stabilizing Operation by planting evergreens and sturdy
shrubs among the boulders.

1n the summer, the department built two toboggan
chutes, uphill dragging chutes, stairways and Hoodlight-
ing. Additional catch basins and sewer connections were

provided, as well as a frostproof water supply for icing
the chutes.

As the snow began to fly, frame voting booths were
set up as temporary shelters. One was equipped as a first-
aid station. An old army barracks was trucked over from
Rouge Park and the city council hurriedly waived a build-
ing regulation so that the frame building could be con-
verted into a comfort station.

East Siders began getting apples in their cheeks as soon
as the gates were removed from the bottom of the chutes.
Last winter, recreation leaders estimated that some 64,000
boys, girls and grownups used the artificial bill. This
winter, the attendance is expected to be even larger.

How did it all begin? Well . . . “We see no reason why
Detroit shouldn’t have hills,” said Department Superin—
tendent John J. Considine. “What nature didn’t do for
us, we’ll do ourselves. We’re going to build not just two
or three hills—and not just for toboggan slides either—
but six or eight or a dozcn. It’s a continuing program;
our only limitation is the amount of fill we can get.”

The hill-building program was not the brainchild of any
one person. lt grew from the combined efforts and think-
ing of many people within the department. Of course,
there may have been more to it than that. There may
have been the unconscious or half-realized yearning of
thousands of Detroit youngsters who never left the Hat-
land. As Considine puts it: “All youngsters love to climb
hills, even if they’ve never had a chance to try it.”

ln more ways than one, building toboggan slides is up-
hill work, and many of the chores fell to William E. Bach-
nlan, Detroit’s park development coordinator. First, there
was the problem of a suitable site. Mr. Bachman scrounged
around the East Side until he was certain that the sixty-one
acre Warren-Canyon Park, developed only recently from

swamp land and dump heap, was the best possible loca-
tion. He needed space for a five-hundred-foot runway,
parking facilities and, above all, a site that could serve
thousands of youngsters.

Warren-Canyon Park had everything—the space, a
three-acre parking lot, and could serve approximately
150,000 East Siders. The parking lot, jam-packed since
the slide was built, had been laid out to serve ice-skaters
at the park’s nearby rink, as well as the football field and
baseball diamonds in the summer and fall.

Next came the problem of cost. Building the slide on
virgin land would have shot the total expenditure up close
to one hundred thousand dollars, according to Mr. Bach-
man’s estimate. The actual cost, excluding the parking lot
and other improvements previously made at the park, was
about fifteen thousand dollars.

The Sale of a Town

The famous “town for sale” has been bought. The people
of Nahma, Michigan, the village which was offered for sale
in 1951, are content, for now they are assured of steady
employment. The Bay de Noquet Lumber Company which,
for the past seventy years, has been the sole industry and
owned all the village’s physical assets, except the school
and the churches, announced the purchase of Nahma by
the American Playground Device Company, Anderson, Indi-
ana. The officials of the company do not intend to move

their headquarters to Nahma, but to operate both installa-
trons.

The purchase includes 4,300 acres of land, a $100,000 L -
community center, several miles of railway, 102 dwellings.
docks to accommodate ships with fourteen-foot draught, a
seventeen-room hotel, a golf course, an cight-bcd hospital,
an airfield, a one-chair harhcrshop, an eighty-bed hoarding
house and numerous industrial huildings. The extensive
Lake Michigan frontage also ofiers tremendous possihilitics
for resort deveIOpment.

It is interesting to note that the expanding sales of play-
ground equipment have made it possible for a relatively
small company to gamble on our nation’s future to the
extent of committing itsclf to such a venture, and to help
the people of Nahma to a continuation of their accustomed
ceonomic level.

Dirt was free. It was hauled in from construction jobs
all over tltc East Side. Cost of the wooden chutes and
staircases was six thousand dollars, and the riprapping con-
tract was five thousand dollars. The latter, incidentally, did
not include any expenditure for materials used, since Mr.
Bachman had discovered a huge pile of boulders in an
abandoned WPA dam project in city-owned Rouge Park.

The floodlighting also was a salvage operation. Eighteen
lights and poles were moved to Warren Canyon from the
former Dexter-Davison Tennis Club, which had been sold
to the city. The cost of adapting and reconditioning this
equipment was slightly over two thousand dollars.

Although it was in no sense an engineering feat, the
actual construction of the tobogganing hill posed certain
other problems. To preserve snowfall as much as possible,
the hill had to face almost due north. In addition, the
sharp—almost fifty per cent—incline at the rear of the
slide had to be strong enough to resist settling and sliding.

As it stands, the mound is twenty-four feet above the
surrounding land; the t0ps of the toboggan chutes are at
thirty feet. Two varieties of fescue grass have done well
on the sledding slopes which flank the tobogganing in-
cline and a profusion of mountain ash, laurel and hardy
evergreens covers the rear slope. Erosion has been negli-
gible. Scenically, the mound blends in admirably with
surrounding greenery and just tops the park’s double
border of elm trees.

At another East Side site, near Mound Road and East
Outer Drive, a second artificial tobogganing hill is being
constructed as an adjunct to 108-acre Farwell Field. A
third hill will be built in Palmer Park, in the northern
part of Detroit. The fourth and the fifth—and the other
hills that are envisioned simply as “beauty spots on the
face of Detroit”-;—ivill take shape just as quickly as time

and money permit.

ASURVEY REPORT of recreation in metrOpolitan Madison,
Wisconsin,* contains a number of statements which
have wide application and are of unusual significance.
They deal with basic objectives and principles and, there-
fore, merit the attention of all who are concerned with
recreation in the community.

The chapter, “Why Do We Need Recreation?,” gives an
analysis of trends in urban living that affect recreation,
and lists the following implications for recreation planning
if a better environment is to be created by the construc-
tive forces of the community.

1. Every community should provide adequate outdoor
and indoor areas and facilities to supplement the needs of
families for play space.

2. Every community should strive for the recapturing of
a sense of belonging to a congenial neighborhood, where
mutually-supporting social relationships prevail.

3. Every community should seek to maintain a reason-
able balance between opportunity for passive and active
forms of recreation.

4. Organized services and facilities in the community
should be concerned about special areas of need where
gross inequalities of recreational opportunity exist.

5. Both public and private rcsources should be mobilized
to provide ample Opportunity for children and adults to
have healthy outdoor experiences in natural surroundings.

6. Leisure-time services need to be concerned about
controversial issues, especially as they relate to the well-
being and survival of the people. Programs with problem-
solving emphasis are not merely apprOpriate, but essential,
if we are to have a reSponsible adult citizenry.

7. Campaigns in every community should be launched
continuously for education of tastes and for development
of discrirnination in the use of commercialized diversion.

NEURENTINN PLANNING

PRINCIPLES AND AGENCY FUNCTIONS

8. Increasing Opportunities need to be afforded for crea-
tive experiences, not merely in the cultural arts, but in all
types of recreation activities.

9. Social group work practices in modern recreation
agencies should place greater stress upon individualization
and development of personal responsibility within the
framework of the grOUp.

10. All agencies with major recreation facilities and
functions should place increased emphasis upon the value
of family-centered fun, either inside or outside the home.

Two chapters dealing with the serviccs provided by pub-
lic and by voluntary group recreation agencies point out
that one of the strategic problems of coordination of rec-
reation services in the modern community is the coopera-
tive formulation of policies and procedures between and
among public and non-public agencies. As a helpful guide
to such formulations, suggested lists of the distinctive func-
tions of both types of agencies are presented.

The unique functions of the public recreation agency,
as outlined, are:

1. Public agencies have responsibility for establishing
and administering recreation facilities and services which
may be available to all the people in the community all
the year around.

2. The scope and content of services should be such
that they provide the maximum enjoyment to'the largest
number of pe0ple possible at a reasonable cost. Some
activities tend to be more expensive per unit than others,
but they are frequently justified in terms of meeting
varied interests and needs for a better balanced program.

3. The public agency develops administrative pro-
cedures which seek to assure a large measure of uniformity
and fairness in providing services for all sections of the
city. For example, the size and location of supervised play-
grounds should be such as to make play opportunities
available to children and adults in all sections.

4. The public agency may, within the limits of time,

441

moncy and statute, engage in certain kinds of research
and experimentation for the purpose of incorporating im-
provements in its own services or for suggcsting necdcd
services to be initiatcd under non-public auspiccs where
appr0priate.

5. Since public agencies operate within statutory limits,
they may not be permitted by law to expand and develop
services beyond the powers definitely allocated to them.

6. The public nature of its services limits the public
agency in dealing with controversial issues as such in its
program, although it may provide a public platform for
the balanced study and discussion of such issues.

7. The public agency may make provisions for the use
of its facilities by non-public agencies, providing that
such use does not unnecessarily duplicate services already
being provided by the public agency.

8. Public agencies may pr0perly call upon the resources
of voluntary and private agencies in promoting com-
munity-wide or neighborhood projects. Joint planning for
such projects may be negotiated unilaterally by one or
more agencies, or they may become a matter of concern
for a central coordinating body, such as a recreation
panel of a community council.

9. Community situations, especially the degree of de-
velopment of various public and non-public agencies, will
determine, in large part, the functions to be performed
by the public agency at any given time. Although no
sharp dividing lines can be drawn to identify precisely
the functions which are unerringly characteristic of either
the public or non-public agency, certain broad principles
should be agreed upon by leaders in each local community
as a basis for more detailed planning and coordination.

The voluntary group or agency, on the other hand, has
the following unique functions:

1. The voluntary group recreation agency offers citi-
zens a wide variety of outlets for the expression of their
social consciousness through service and/ or financial sup-
port in programs which are of pertinent interest to them.

2. The existence of different types of such group rec-
reation agencies in the community provides a broad oppor-
tunity for individuals and groups to meet needs and- in-

terests for participation.

3. Even in cities where public leisure-time agencies are

well-organized, and where a large volume of services is

provided, there still is need for the supplementation of
public services through voluntary agencies to meet spe-
cial interests and needs.

4. Traditionally, because of its non-public character,
the voluntary agency has assumcd the responsibility for
experimcntation and demonstration of services and tech-
niqucs which may ultimately lead to public acceptance
and support through tax funds.

5. There exists in every community particular special
groupings (such as racial, ideological, economic) which
need specifically-directh services. The voluntary agency
can serve these special groups through flexible small unit
groupings and through the “membership” character of its
organlzatlon.

6. The need for small-group experience and individual
guidance in the discovery and deve10pment of leisure-time
interests is a significant part of the total community rec-
reation picture. Although such a need is mct in part
through public recreation programs, the voluntary agency
continues to find this an important area of supplementa-
tlon.

7. The voluntary agency-is able to provide a permis-
sive atmosphere within comparatively small groups for
those individuals who have special needs because of timidi-
ty, inadequate skills, emotional instability or lack of proper
social contacts and adjustments, for the purpose of help-
ing them to find an understanding of their problems,
beneficial association and technically-skilled guidance.

8. The promotion and development of neighborhood or
area organization are the particular responsibilities and
Opportunities for the voluntary agency.

9. The deve10pment of voluntary group leadership and
committee service is a distinctive responsibility of the
voluntary agency, for the perpetuation of democratic plan-
ning and participation.

10. The voluntary agency has unique opportunities for
research and investigation of the problems of those per-
sons and groups who, for one reason or another, do not
seek group activities or other resources for socialization.

Because of the close relationship of the University of
Wisconsin to the leisure-time opportunities of the pe0ple
of Madison, the recreation functions of university organi-
zations also were pointed out. To a considerable degree,
these functions are equally applicable to all educational
institutions on the secondary school and college levels.
Three functions of university organizations which seek
to stimulate students and faculty to participate in a va-
riety' of leisure-time activities are:

1. University organizations seek to satisfy the desires
of clientele for pleasurable diversion from the routine of
academic life.

2. University organizations seek deliberately to meet
some of the conscious and unconscious needs for physical,
emotional and social development.

3. University agencies and organizations provide 0p-
portunitics for leadership and service in the campus com-
munity, especially for the student, in order that he may
become better prepared for the responsibilities of adult
participation in the wider community.

Personnel Change

Pierce V. Gahan, city recreation di-
rector of St. Petersburg, Florida, re-
cently was retired after twenty-seven

JANUARY 1952

years of service, because of a needed
cut in the city’s budget. He is succeed-
ed by his assistant, Jack S. Puryear,
whose own position was abolished be-
cause of the $4,800 cut in funds for
the coming fiscal year. The slash fol-
lowed orders by city council for City
Manager Ross E. Windom to cut one
mill from the tax levy.

In announcing the retirement of
Mr. Gahan, Windom said: “Mr. Gahan
has done an excellent job in the past
and brought national publicity to St.
Petersburg, but he is now sixty-six
and able to retire on pension.

“I felt that since he can retire on
pension, the abolishment of his posi-
tion would not work an undue hard-
ship upon him and Puryear has been
grooming for the position for years.”

Mr. Gahan was recreation director
since he first came to St. Petersburg in
1924-. He launched a program to in-
clude recreation for both young and
old in the community. In fact, the rec-
ord states that his position was not
created, but was the demand of the

citizens for centralized administration‘

of recreation. In May, he was present-
ed with a citation by the Florida
Recreation Association, naming him
“Dean of Recreation” and lauding his
forty-two years of “faithful service in
furthering the pursuit of happiness.”

Jack Puryear was appointed assist-
ant recreation director in February
194-6. For about two years, he was in
full charge of youth activities.

Official Softball Rules
Official softball rules for 1952 un-

derwent the following major changes
at the annual meeting of the Interna-
tional Joint Rules Committee on Soft-

ball in Detroit, Michigan.

Of particular importance to women
and girls was the change in pitching
distance from thirty-five to thirty-eight
feet. For male pitchers and umpires,
the strike zone will be “that space
over home plate which is between
the batter°s armpits and the top of thc

knees, when the batter assumes his
natural stance.” The pitcher is not per-
mitted to make more than one revolu-
tion of the arm in the so-called “wind-
mill” pitch.

In 1952, a bunt will be considered
“a batted ball.” The infield fly rule

will be in effect for any fly that can
reasonably be handled by an infielder.

A new section—Rule 21——will be
added, pertaining to when the batsman
is out. It will read: “If, after striking
or bunting the ball, he intentionally
strikes the ball a second time, strikes
it with a thrown bat or deflects its
coursc in any manner while running
to first base, the ball is dead and no
runners may advance. If the runner
drops his bat, the ball rolls against the
bat and, in the umpire’s judgment,
there was no intention to interfere with
the course of the ball, the ball is alive
and in play.”

If a bat completely complies with
official specifications, it need not be

marked “Official Softball Bat.”

The following officers were elected
to the International Joint Rules Com-
mittee for 1952: chairman, C. E. Brew-
er, New York City; vice-chairman,
James Lang, San Francisco, Califor-
nia; secretary-treasurer, A. T. Noren,

ter, H. G. Johnson, Detroit, Michigan.

Can you imagine an empty oatmeal box
dubbing for a pocketbook, a wagon-load
of old newspapers shaped to form a life-size giraffe, or one
of daddy’s worn~out socks made into a cuddly doll? Be-
lieve it or not, it can be done—and with little or nothing.
These articles, and many more seemingly useless objects,
can be used as arts and crafts material. Just ask the
children and adults who participate in the free arts and

crafts classes sponsored by the City Division of Recrea-
tion in Louisville, Kentucky.

Every summer, the recreation leaders manage to open
the summer playground season by promoting scavenger
hunts. The kiddies search the neighborhoods near the parks
and playgrounds for scrap materials of any kind. They
literally “clean-up” the neighbors’ cluttered garages, base-
ments and attics of old n10p handles, fruit crates, license
plates and sucker sticks from which doll houses, jewelry,
pocketbooks and the like are later made. Basic supplies
used in the construction of crafts articles are donated
by the recreation division and then supplcmented with
objects acquired by the children on these scavenger hunts.

A fairly new project which has received much enthusi-
astic response, not only from the younger children—ages
nine to eleven—but from teen-agers as well, is pastepot
pictures. These require scrap material and construction
paper. Various textured materials, such as silk, wool and
cotton, are desirable. Mrs. Geraldine Owens, supervisor
at Baxter Recreation Center, states that the children choose
their own design and work “for hours and hours.” The
project allows each youngster to express himself freely
in design. For instance, one child might select brown
corduroy for a tree trunk, while another might prefer a
surrealistic polka dot. Because of the originality and con-

Another project, entirely made from scrap cardboard
and wood, features fans made by teen-age members of
the La Couga Club at Baxter Recreation Center. Construc-
tion material consists of medium-weight poster board and
a handle formed from a flat stick which is stapled to the
board on both sides. Tongue depressors are inexpensive
and also can be used. Sometimes they will be donated to
recreation groups when the purpose for which they will
be used is made known. A design is then painted upon
the poster board fan with showcard paint—the gayer, the
better! Large Hower prints make particularly pleasing
decorations.

The activity is particularly good for a summer play-
ground project, as most people are happy to own fans
during the hot summer months. In fact, club members
presented some of their fans to a golden-age group of men
and women over sixty.

An all-time favorite with kiddies is the life-size papier-
maché animals which serve as playground mascots. Alli-
gators, lions and giraffes are made from old newspapers,
scrap wood, string and wallpaper paste. Parkhill Play-
ground created an entire circus, mounted upon wooden
blocks. The Stephen Foster Playground completed a zoo,
and Clifton Playground planned an elaborate Noah’s Ark.
Some of the small papier-maché animals can be fashioned
by individuals, while others are put together as part of a
children’s group project.

One recreation leader says of working with papier-
maché: “The simple act of dipping strips of paper into
wallpaper paste and doing something creative have really
helped solve my discipline problems.”

All of these handcrafts, and many more, represent a
summer’s work on Louisville playgrounds. The annual
arts and crafts show, in which all of these articles are on
public exhibition, winds up the playground season.

In search for scrap ma-
terials of all kinds, the
children “clean up” the
neighbors’ cluttered at-
tics, garages and base-
ments. Also, scavenger
hunts promoted on sum-
mer playgrounds are a
source of additional sup-
plies, as. wcll as fun.

Reoreation’s Part

in Mental Health“

 

EVEN THOUGH WE cannot demonstrate
a direct relationship between rec-
reation and mental health, we have
a very strong feeling that there is
some relationship of an indirect na-
ture; and that, though admittedly in-
direct, recreation does exert its in-
Huence upon our total adjustment and
over-all eHiciency and happiness.

This feeling of ours concerning the
importance of play and recreation in
our lives is based upon our concept of
the healthy personality and the condi-
tions necessary to establish one in the
young child. For example, we state
that the one fundamental and basic
requirement in the family situation of
the young child is a condition of sta-
bility and seeming permanence, which
will establish within him a sense of
security. It is a condition of security
wherein the child is loved and wanted
and responds with such a feeling.

This condition of security we con-
sider basic in the growing child. But
we do not consider it the only ingredi-
ent of the healthy personality, either
in childhood or in adulthood. We note
that it is not enough just to keep alive
and that it is not enough just to spend
every last bit of energy to ensure
one’s basic security. We recognize-—
and generations of people before us
in all lands have recognized it too—

‘An address presented at the National Rec-
reation Association Congress, Boston, Massa-

chusetts, October 4, 1951.
4-46

that over and above the vitality to be
.expended to ensure security there is,
or should be, a surplus vitality that
enables one to engage in other rela-
tionships and in other activities be-
yond those related to the sustenance
of self. There are certain aspects of
growth and development, certain po-
tentialities of expression, which have
little security value but tremendous
value in the individual’s drive for total
self-realization. Hence our feelings of
security and freedom from fears must
be regarded as a means to other ends
involving self-expression—that is, we
seek security as a condition for further
growth and development as creatively
social, not economic, beings.

By the same token, if we do have—
under all but very extraordinary con-
ditions of economic hardship—this
expendable surplus vitality, we must
have acceptable avenues for the ex-
pression of it; and these avenues, at
their best, will allow for both crea-
tion by, and re-creation of, the in-

dividual.

This leads us immediately into a
consideration of the nature and value

“of play and recreation as they are

viewed by the mental hygienist. We
are aware that many theories have
been advanced throughout the ages,
from Aristotle and Quintilian down
through and to Herbart, Gross, John-
son and G. Stanley Hall, to explain
play and recreation. But none of these

theories have been totally satisfactory,
either because they did not explain
why the individual plays in the first
place—that is, why he plays or rec-
reates at all-—-or why he plays as he
does; that is, there was not an asso-
ciated satisfactory explanation of the
choices of expressions in the play ac-
tivity.

The psychiatrist or the social scien-
tists contributing to the mental hygicne
field cannot, of course, answer the
question as to the nature of play and
recreation, which is basic to the pro-
fcssion of recreation leadership. But,
in our fields, we do have a very gcnu-
ine interest in this, and have evolved
a working hypothesis as regards play
and recreation that enables us to rec-
ognize their great value in sustaining
the individual’s mental health.

We, in child psychiatry, regard play
as a very effective and mentally-healthy
compromise response. It is the best
compromise that can be attained be-
tween the driving power of the uncon-
scious instinctual forces of man (ag-
gressive and sexual) and the demands
by society that such instinctual ex-
pressions be repressed. You will note
that we do not feel, as did many of
the play theorists at the turn of the
century, that play is a separate and
distinct instinct of man, but, rather,
that there are instinctual ingredients
or segments in all play activity and
that their release in these socially-
acceptable ways is highly beneficial.
Hence play becomes important both
to the individual participating and to
those of you who are interested in
planning play and recreational pro-
grams, because of its powers and po-
tentialities for both expression and re-
pression of certain innate tendencies
which are destined to come to the
surface through the use of that energy
or vitality not entirely bound to eco-
nomic activities. The individual, with-
out guidance, may select a recreation
activity that will give him the proper
mentally-healthy balance between the
need to express and the need to re-

'i‘press; but expert recreation workers,

with planned and diversified programs,
might conceivably offer the individual
a better choice or range of sclection.
Before leaving this aspect of our
problem—the mental hygienist’s inter-
pretation of the nature of play—I

RECREATION

think that I should emphasize one as-
pect of this activity that is usually
overlooked, or at least undervalued
and minimized as to its importance.
This is the value of the repressive
features in play and recreational ac-
tivity. It is more in keeping with the
times to place an extremely high value
upon what play and recreation allow
one to express (of an instinctual na-
ture), but equally important to us in
the mental hygiene field are those fac-
tors in the play activity—the setup,
the rules, the regulations, the require-
ments and so on—which prevent the
individual from giving too free an
expression of innate drives, let us say,
of his aggression and hostility. Such
expression, if not nicely balanced by
repressive features in the recreation
activity, would lead to feelings of guilt
and need for punishment—and such
are not conducive to mental health
and adjustment. In this connection,
too, it is well to add that the symbolic
significance of play, and the tacit
agreement on all sides that this ac-
tivity is removed from how we actu-
ally feel toward one another, allow the
fullest possible expression of this ex-
pression-repression balance. The rec-
reation activity is “a reasonable fac-
simile” of our activities or relation-
ships with other people, but it is not
identical. This is about as far as the

hygienist can go.

There are three other areas in which
the psychiatrist and the recreation ex-
"K pert have a common interest: (1) the
therapeutic aspects of play and recrea-
tion; (2) mental health principles in
relation to the player; and (3) mental
health principles relating to leaders in
recreation.

As to the therapeutic values in play
and recreation, I cite briefly the gen-
eral experiences with play therapy with
children. As you know, in play thera-
py, having set the stage with toys and
equipment of all sorts or for a par-
ticular age group, we allow the child
the widest sort of freedom in his choice
of play material and the time he shall
spend at it. The child will tend to use
those matcrials—dolls, for example-—-
which more easily symbolize his prob-
lems, fears and areas of anxiety; and
his activity with these materials, hos-
tile or loving, will be indicative of his

JANUARY 1952

feelings. The outstanding feature of
the play usually is his endless replay-
ing of the same activity in precisely
the same manner. There is no great
deviation in pattern, and he never
seems to tire of it. However, even
though it is the usual procedure with
such children to interpret to them
what they seem to be doing and what
they seem to be trying to say about
their life’s difficulties, even if such in-
terpretations are not made, the child
is benefited merely by the expression
of his feelings in a controlled, friend-
ly setting. There is a “release” from
tension, we say, and this method of
approach in play therapy is designated
as “release therapy.”

Now if this type of expression in
play and recreation is such as to afford
relief from tension in the emotionally-
disturbed youngster, presumably it has
a like effect upon normal children
and adults; but, even more impor-
tant, such release from tension should
be beneficial in a preventative, as well
as in a curative or therapeutic, sense.
This “tension” of which we speak,
and which we would release, is, I
assume, the tension created by unex-
pressed or directly unexpressable im-
pulses of an instinctual nature, par-
ticularly those which are aggressive in
nature and destructive in intent.

Presumably, of course, there are
more values in such a complex ac-
tivity as that which we term “recrea-
tional” than merely in “release from
tension”; but it is this release, in the
expressive-repressive act of play, that
seems to the mental hygienist to be
very significant.

In the second place, then, what are
some of the mental health principles
that one would, or could, outline for
the prospective player—the person
about to follow a program of recrea-
tion? The great diversity of needs of
different individuals so apparent to us,
plus the admixtures and subtleties rela-
tive to the correct expression of these
needs, act to caution me in my attempt
to program a recreational life that
would be in the best interest of every
individual’s mental health. It seems to
me that we should encourage the great-
est amount of individual choice; and
this would be my first advice to the
recreating individual and also to those

who make recreation programs pos-
sible for others. Whether the recrea-
tion chosen is bee-keeping or moun-
tain climbing, it is chosen by a par-
ticular person because this type of rec-
reation for him embodies all the ave-
nues for subtle expression of instinc-
tual needs which are necessary for him
at that period in his life; and, at the
same time, the activity is such that it
denies expressions which will make
for internal emotional conflicts. For-
tunately, there is a wide enough choice
of recreational pursuits in most areas
of this country to enable individual
needs to be satisfied.

In respect to the choice of recrea-
tional pursuit, it is well for the in-
dividual to realize that his choices are
bound to vary in different periods of
his life. This is so because his needs
will vary with his age, his choice of oc-
cupation and success in it, his changed
relationships with other people—nota-
bly those relationships within the fam-
ily group. Today’s hobby may be to-
morrow’s headache, and one must not
feel guilty when changes in recrea-
tional preference occur.

Again, I feel that the recreation that
best serves the interests of the mental
health of man is that which really in-

xxvolves the “creation” of something. I

say, I “feel” that this is so, but per-
haps it is merely that all of us put
an extremely high value upon activity
for production and an equally low
value upon activity undertaken for
its own sake. It is a part of our Puri-
tan tradition to decry noncreative en-
deavors. Participation in such perhaps
makes us feel guilty and sinful.

But setting aside this possibility of
bias for a moment, I think that we
have good and sufficient reason to urge
that our recreation be creative, as the
best insurance that it will be re-crea-
tive of ourselves as individuals. Very
few peOple, at the present time, with
our large industries, diversified and
segmentalized work activities, ever have
the opportunity of creating a finished
product. The impulses in most peo-
ple to create, to build, to make grow,
to nurture a planned object through
all the phases of development—these
impulses, all of which are so closely al-
lied with fundamental biological im-
pulses, just do not get enough expres-

447

sion. Therefore, it is reasonable to
suppose that any program of recrea-
tion that offers and encourang this
type of response—the really creative
response—would, by and large, servc
the mental health needs of men.

Finally, then, what are the mental
health implications of these theories
and observations as far as the recrea-
tion leaders are concerned?

First of all, it is inlplicd that recrea-
tional choice must be self-pr0pelled
and self-motivated if it is to have any
mental health value at all for the in-
dividual participant. The recreation
leader offers the best possible set of
circumstances for certain recreation
interests to go forward and he offers
-—-or does his best to have the com-
munity offer and sponsor—the widest
possible choices of recreation activities
to be given under his direction and

guidance.

Now, even though we have empha-
sized the value of freedom of choice
for individual expression in recrea-
tion, it does not mean that the recrea-
tion leader plays the passive role of
the overseer. By training, he should
be equipped to sense the needs of cer-
tain groups for certain types of eXpres-
sion and vary his program, group
and individual, in relation to these
needs. To be sure, he is, in addition,
a protector and overseer, and rightly
so, because the eXpression of instinc-
tual drives in play and recreation does
need control and regulation and con-
tinual modification of expression, pri-
marily in the interest of the whole
group and secondarily in the interest
of giving added control to the uncon-
scious impulses of each of the indi-
vidual participants.

In the third place, I need not tell
you that, in many instances, expert
guidance and direction are needed to
enable the individual to arrive at the
proper choices. Creative urges which
involve the use of building material,
for example, can be satisfied in hun-
dreds of ways, only six or seven of
which may be known to the person
wishing and needing such expression.
This is the guidance and educational
role that I would consider of topmost
importance in the leader’s list of du-
tics, whether he is dealing with groups
or individuals, with children or adults.

In the fourth place, with the proper
mental hygicne orientation, the recre-
ation leader could do much to further
the adjustment of pcople in his care.
A sincere endeavor to discover just
what arc thc child’s or adult’s needs,
an attempt to determine what are the
assets and liabilities of the individual
in his interpcrsonal relationships, and
thoughtful planning to care for these
needs and deficiencies in some small
measure in the rather limited time
allowed him—these are the roles which
the mental hygicnist would envisage
for the leader in recreation today.
This, I presume, we would consider
his preventive role.

In addition, the recreation leader,

"particularly one who works in the chil-

dren’s area, often can, and does, detect
the early signs of emotional maladjust-
ment in youngsters and can see to it
that they are referred to the proper
child guidance mental hygiene clinic
personnel for intensive work. Extreme-
ly aggressive youngsters, extremely
withdrawn, passive or shy children, or
those who appear moody and depressed
many times cannot be adapted to their
programs, nor can the programs be
adapted to them. They need individual
help and, although we have no inten-
tion of trying to make a psychiatrist
of our leader, it is possible for him to
appreciate the signs of emotional dif-

.~Jvithin the group while therapy is go-

ficulty in his group members.

In the same way, cooperative treat-
ment programs between the clinic and
recreation center are possible, and the
individual work of thc therapist re-
ceives valuable help and clarification
through the observations of the recrea-
tion leader of the child’s activities

ing on. This type of coopcrative group-
individual therapy has proved to be
very helpful and practical in work
with adolcscent delinquent boys.

To summarize: I have given you
some of the thoughts of the psychia-
trist in respect to the nature of play
and recreation, its usefulness in the
interests of the individual’s mental
health and the possible mental hygiene
role of the recreation leader.

In the last analysis, it is the horizons
and the inherent possibilities for crea-
tive work in one’s job which make that
job worthwhile. And the creative satis-
factions in the recreation leader’s job
can well arise from the fact that he is
nurturing, guiding and develOping the
cxpressions of other people which,
more often than not, will be the only
truly creative expressions which they
will ever have. Such possibilities, to
help pe0p1e, should make your work
all the more meaningful and ever so
much more significant.

Japanese Arts and Crafts Tour

Plans are under way for an exhibit
of Japanese arts and crafts materials
in American cities throughout the
country.

Now the citizens of Japan are view-
ing the results of American work while
the Japanese exhibit, first displayed
at the 1951 National Recreation Con-
gress in Boston, has been prepared for
an American tour by John Mahan, Su-
pervisor, Arts and Crafts Center, Board
of Park Commissioners, Wichita.

If you would like to have your com-
munity included in the arts and crafts
exhibit itinerary, please write immedi-
ately to Mr. T. E. Rivers, Secretary,
Recreation Congress Committee, 315
Fourth Avenue, New York 10, New
York, specifying preferred dates. A
special catalog is available in quanti-
ties at ten cents a c0py. Local sponsors

of the exhibit will be asked to be re-
sponsible for express charges from the
previous exhibit point.

Special Service Openings

New quotas for overseas recrea-
tion personnel recently have been a11-
nounced. The most urgent need is for
women for special service club work
in the Japanese area. Some may be
sent to 'Korea, but only those who
volunteer for this spccilic location. Ap-
plicants must be twenty-four to forty
years of age, single, in good health,
interested in arts and crafts, music,
drama or social rccrcation, and with
varying experience for the dificrcnt
positions.

Information concerning all special

RECREATION

Games

for Bengt-necks

Too MANY PEOPLE are quick to
label as “bad” the youngsters who
seem unable to participate in normal
recreational activities without lighting.
These “had kids” are sometimes called
anti-social, which is entirely false and
thoroughly unjust.

There is nothing bad about a rough
youngster. He just is not able to satis-
fy his aggressive impulse in regular
games. I have found that the so-callcd
“roughneck” has as much social eon-
sciousness as any other child, when
allowed to participate in games which
suit his aggressive temperament.

Not long ago, I was employed by
the Mary Wharton Settlement House
as recreation director. This is located
in North Philadelphia, in a neighbor-
hood consisting largely of families in
the low income group. At the time of
my employment, our settlement house
was one of the few places offering ree-
reation to the children of the neigh-
horhood.

My classes, which were held in our
small gymnasium, were crowded with
some of the wildest boys—from twelve
to fifteen—whom you could possibly
gather in one place. At first it was al-
most impossible to organize any recre-
ational activities, for they were not
interested in any of the conventional
games. Then I hit upon the idea of
teaching rougher games, and interest

grew. Such games as “Brute Basket-
ball,” “Pom Pom Pull-Away” and
“Capture the Flag” went over with a
bang.

“Brute Basketball” is played on a
regulation basketball court and resem-
hles the oHicial game, except that the
number of players is unlimited. Al-
though therc are only five players from
each team on the court at a time, the
remaining members line the sides from
one end of the court to the other. The
players on the court may run three
steps with the ball, then must either
pass the ball to another teammate on
the court or to one of their teammates
on the sidelines.

The players on the sidelines may
not run with the ball. They only can
pass it on to another player on the
sidelines or to a teammate on the
court. The opposing team may take the
ball in any reasonably rough way (no
mayhem, of course!) from opponents
on the court, but cannot attempt to
take the ball from the players on the
sideline. However, a member of the
opposing team may intercept a pass
from a player on the sideline to his
teammate on the court. A point is
scored when one of the players on the
court makes a basket. Any attempt by
a player on the sideline to make a
basket will result in his team losing
possession of the ball. Each player gets
a chance to play on the court and on
the sidelines.

At first, the boys never passed the
ball, but piled on whoever had it, in a

great wrestling and tugging free-for-
all. However, they finally realized that
it was foolish to fight and tug for the
ball when all they had to do when at-
tacked was to pass it to a teammate.
Soon the wrestling and tugging were
almost absent from the game; and, the
more they played, the more effectively
they worked together.

“Pom Pom Pull-Away” was easy for
the boys to learn because it is sim-
ple and rough. They are divided into
two teams, the “line team” and the
“charging team.” The line team stands
facing the charging team on a line
halfway between any two points. The
charging team is organized on one of
the two points, facing the line team.

On the command, “Pom Pom Pull-
Away,” the charging team charges at
the line team. The object of the line
team is to stop as many members of
the charging team as possible from
getting across the line. They may do
this by wrestling their opponents and
holding them on the line until the com-
mand, “Haltl,” is given.

On the other hand, the charging
team may capture members of the line
team by carrying them off the line and
holding them until “Halt!” is com-
manded. Players on the charging team
who cross the line safely must charge
back across the line again. The cap-
tivcs must join the team that captured
them, and the game continues until
one team consumes the other or great-
ly outnumbers it. ‘

As they played the game, the boys
seemed to become more and more
mindful of their teanimates’ welfare.
At first, it was each individual striving
to cross the line himself, but they soon
came to realize that in order to Win,
they must help the others to get across,
especially the smaller boys. This feel-
ing did not end with the games, but
carried over into other activities. In
some cases, boys who, in the begin-
ning, were first to take advantage of
smaller boys, became the first to lend
them a helping hand.

“Capture the Flag,” more than any
of the other games, gave the boys the
responsibility of carrying out a plan.
In this activity, Hags are placed at a
maximum distance of one hundred
yards, but this distance may vary ae-

4149~

cording to the space available. It is the
object of each team to protect its flag
and, at the same time, to capture the
flag of the opponent.

Naturally, every boy wanted to be
the hero and capture the opponent’s
flag. However, they soon learned that
if everyone tried to capture the op-
ponent’s fiag, no one would be left to
protect his own flag. Moreover, when
everyone tries to capture the enemy’s
flag, it leads to a great deal of chaos
and wrangling.

It was not long before they began to

form plans of attack and dcfense in
what resembled football huddles. The
game soon took a definite pattern. In-
stead of everyone going on the attack,
some stayed behind to defend the flag.
The others proceeded to capture the
opponent’s flag, not by individual ef-
fort', but by blocking opponents and
making it possible for one boy to do
the capturing.

These games are rough, often caus-
ing bumps and bruises. But they are
designed for rough youngsters who
probably would get the same bumps

and bruises in a wild free-for-all, with
no ultimate cause or effect.

These games can, however, teach
the lessons of sound rccreation. They
develop powers of reasoning, build
physically, challenge the creative abili-
ty of a boy, promote his confidence in
himself and his fellows and encourage
the team spirit. They prove to the boy
that little is accomplished by forcc
alone, and that cooperation with oth-
ers is essential to progress. With this
knowledge, he soon loses the traits
which make him a roughneck.

 

TRENDS

The Delinquency Picture

The Juvenile Court statistics, 1946-
1949, released in 1951 by the Chil-
dren’s Bureau, Federal Security Agen-
cy, state that, in 1949, for the first
time since the end of the war, juvenile
court delinquency cases reversed their
downward trend and increased by four
per cent over the previous year. The
increase was greater for unofficial cases
than for official cases and greater in
the smaller courts than in the larger
courts.

Ofiicial cases are those placed on
the official court’s calendar for adjudi-
cation. . . . Unofficial cases are those
which can readily be adjusted by the
judge, referee, probation ofiicer or
other ofiicer of the court without for-
mal hearing.

A total of 70,616 juvenile delin-
quency cases disposed of during 1949
were reported by 413 courts located in
twenty-two states. Forty courts werc
large courts—serving areas with popu-
lations of one hundred thousand
or more. Since a child may appear
before the court two or more times
during the year, the number of cases
reported is larger than the number of
different children involved. Most of the
- 413 courts reported these data, and it
was found that the number of delin-
quency cases was sixteen per cent
higher than the number of children
involved.

From these data, it is estimated that
almost three hundred thousand chil-

450

dren, or about twelve in every one
thousand, between the ages of seven
and seventeen, came to the attention
of juvenile courts in 1949 because of
delinquency. Over half (fifty-eight per
cent) of the delinquency cases report-
ed by the 413 courts were handled
unofficially.

The median age of the children in-
volved in delinquency cases in the 413
courts was about fifteen and a half
years. Boys’ cases outnumbered girls’
cases in the ratio of four to one. This
ratio varied in courts in different
states. In general, one reason for the
greater number of boys’ cases may be
our cultural patterns, permitting more
freedom to boys so that they are more
likely to be picked up by police for
infractions of the law. Boys are more
outwardly aggressive than girls and
this aggressiveness sometimes results
in overt delinquent acts. Also, boys
tend more to associate in gangs, and
delinquent behavior often stems from
misdirected gang activities.

Parks

The officers and board of directors
of the American Planning and Civic
Association, at its 1951 annual meet-
ing, passed the following resolution:

“The board continues to hannner
home its belief that land once dedi-
cated to parks in citics and counties
should be protected from uses unrelat-
ed to recognized park services; it de-
plores the use of park sites for public

buildings, private development or
automobile parking in order to effect
fancied economies, when frequently the
sacrifice of park values would be much
greater than the cost of suitable park-
ing and public building sites.

“The board continues to oppose the
use of city, county, state and national
parkways, established for pleasure
travel, for commercial trafiic.”

* ‘I ‘I

The following was written by Presi-
dent Joseph Carson of the Fairmount
Park Commission, Philadelphia, and
appeared in the commission’s eighty-
third annual report (1950):

“Efforts are constantly being made
to encroach upon the parks for this or
that governmental' purpose. These are
laudable enough in themselves, but to
yield to them is to curtail the open
spaces which an expanding city must
have to be worthy of the name of a
modern city. The matter has been
constantly alluded to ill these reports
in past years and need not be elabo-
rated again. The commission would
beg the council to repel such endeav-
ors, for lands taken for uses other than
recreational purposes can never be re-
captured. Such a policy of preserving
what the city now has and the acquir-
ing of new open spaces must appeal to
anyone who wishes Philadelphia to bc
a better and open city and not a stifled
and confined one. The greatest and
single asset the citizens possess are the
four thousand acres of F airmount
Park, which excite envy and compari-
son. But no comparison may be made,
for none exists.”

Recreation in Crisis

THE LAST SHOT of the United States State Department’s

motion picture had just been completed, in Manhattan,
Kansas. The working crew placed the last bit of the edu-
cational film neatly into its containers and prepared to de-
part as quickly as possible. Soon the people of this modest
American city would be moving across the movie screens
of Germany, Belgium, France and other European coun-
tries. In their own way, these residents of the Middlewest
would be telling the world how their community achieved
a democratic recreation program through the full co-
operation of all of its citizens.

As the director and his crew boarded the train for their
next assignment, the civic leaders of Manhattan were on
hand. There was hand-shaking all around. It had been a
pleasant and novel experience to be actors in a real movie.

Reflected in their faces was pride in themselves and their
community.

The story of democracy at work in this city of nineteen
thousand was a powerful one. It had been well told. All
that remained to be done were the editing and the trans-
lating into the languages of the thirty countries where the
film would soon be shown.

In the days that followed, Manhattan settled down to
its usual friendly routine. The recreation program, which
a few weeks before had been the center of attraction be-
cause of its selection for international acclaim, was busily
concerned with its summer activities program. Playgrounds,
baseball leagues, hobby clubs—the whole range of leisure-
time activities for all ages—were going at full speed.

But even as the train with the film stafi moved ofi into
the distance, the clouds of catastrophe were gathering.
During the next few days, the destructive forces of na-
ture brought closer and closer the flood waters which
would soon bring disaster and turn the city into a mass
of wreckage.

The part that the organized community recreation pro-
gram played in alleviating this catastrophe will not, of
course, be seen in the State Department film. But indelibly
stamped in the minds of the people of Manhattan is the

Waters flowed five feet deep through the streets, overran a
large part of the residential section and routed hundreds of peo-
ple from their homes. Drying out was an expensive process.

knowledge that community recreation is a solid part of
community living, both in normal times and in crisis. For
Manhattan suddenly was in real difficulty.

The twisting, churning Big Blue and Kansas Rivers had
reached a crescendo, and the raging waters bore down
upon the town. They poured five feet deep through the
main street, overran much of the residential section and
swiftly routed hundreds of people from their homes. The
whole complex structure of living was thrown into a jum-
bled mass of confusion. To a few, the ugly water brought
death. To many, it meant a loss of property and personal
possessions. For everyone, it left a wake of worry, work
and waste.

Under the direction of the American Red Cross, a mass
care center was established immediately on the campus
of Kansas State College. During the days which followed,
one out of every ten residents of Manhattan would be
living in the shelters of the college gymnasium, the stadi-
um, the field house and the hospital.

The morning after the flood started, Superintendent of
Recreation Frank J. Anneberg made his way up to the
flood headquarters at Kansas State College. There, in the
temporary offices of the mayor and city manager, he pro-

posed a plan to continue the recreation services of his de-
partment. What recreation eould do would be to affirm
that living in Manhattan, Kansas, USA, even in times of
great emergency, meant more than the basic animal fune-
tions of eating, sleeping and working. For the ehildren,
it would he a positive declaration that their world of play
was one that really eoncerned adults.

Anneberg acted fast. He eonferred with the acting presi-
dent of the eollege and then set up his office in the college
auditorium. By radio, he got in toueh with his thirty—
seven part and full-time recreation specialists -and di-
reeted them to report to him immediately. He broadcast
an appeal to the eitizens of Manhattan for entertainers, play
leaders, storytellers, square dance eallers and motion pie-
ture projectionists, to report to him as soon as possible.
By shortwave radio, a eall went out to a motion picture
supply house in Wichita, 150 miles away, asking for a
week’s supply of entertaining film to be sent immediately
by Civil Air Patrol to the munieipal golf eourse clubhouse.
Arrangements were made with the ehairman of the col-
lege slimmer reereation curriculum to use summer students
for leadership positions. At Anneberg’s request, the eollege
opened its museum and library for the use of all. With
these tools available, the reereation department put on a
morale-building program that is a tribute to the people
of Manhattan, as well as to the leadership of Frank Anne-
berg.

On the lawn in front of the gymnasium, on the practiee
football field near the stadium and in the open area of the
college field house, playgrounds operated from early morn-
ing to late in the evening seven days a week. Intended at
first. as eenters to keep the ehildrcn busy and out of the
way, the recreation leaders quickly realized that the adults,
too, were anxious to partieipate. Storytelling, handerafts,
active and quiet. games made everyone forget, for the
moment, the terrible disaster of whieh they were a part.

Daily movies were shown in the eollege auditorium.

per. Publie address systems piped musie to all of the mass
care areas from time to time during the day.

Within three hours after the first eall for volunteers
was broadcast over the radio, a eomplete amateur talent
show was organized for immediate performances. A three-
aet play and an Operetta, whieh were in the rehearsal stage
at the time of the flood, were presented as rehearsal pro-
duetions, with the audience treated to the unusual sight
of having the director stop the performance from time
to time to offer SUggestions and comments.

Thousands of eomie books, toys and game equipment
were gathered from all possible sourees. Horseshoe, vol-
leyball and tennis equipment were moved into the area
and leadership provided to stimulate and guide activities.
Band eoneerts, square dancing and social daneing were
among the special events planned and earried forth under
the guidanee of the Manhattan reereation department.

For the two thousand peOple jammed into the mass eare
eenters, all of these reereation aetivitics were a respite
from worry and from the monotonous warnings of ra-
dio and loudspeaker: “Report for breakfast in the eafc-
teria. . . .” “Get in line for your typhoid shots. . . .” “Re-
member to boil all drinking water. . . .”

It was a heartwarming sight to see several hundred
people square dancing on the college tennis eourts the day
after they had been foreed to leave their homes. Of course
shock and fatigue were in evidenec. There was that numb
feeling resulting from the loss of possessions whieh had
been accumulated over the years. But these Manhattanites
gathered their remaining strength and entered wholeheart-
edly into the rhythm of the danec. They were proving to
themselves and to the world that, although they might be
down, they eertainly were not out.

Gradually, the waters settled haek into the regular ehan-
nels of the rivers. The people left their temporary campus
shelters and returned to dig out and salvage what re-
mained of their homes and their personal possessions;
and, as life settled baek to near normal, the eommunity

RECREATION

recreation program returned to the parks, the playgrounds
and the indoor centers.

In the files of the Manhattan recreation department are
a number of letters which speak for the people who bene-
fited from this emergency program. The Governor of
Kansas, Edward F. Arn, sent his personal commendation
for “the time and effort spent in keeping up the morale
of our citizens struck by the recent floods.”

llarvey T. Nickel, executive director of the Riley County
Chapter of the American Red Cross, spoke for all of the
citizens when he wrote: “Manhattan has had a community
recreation program that has well supplied our boys and
girls and older peeple with suitable activities at all times.
At no time was this program more appreciated than during
our recent flood disaster. We, in Red Cross, greatly ap-
preciated this cooperation because it tended to relieve the
stress and strain of emotions within the shelters. After the
first day, the people began to fret and children became
restless with nothing to do. The recreation program pro-
vided the very necessary entertainment and activity to
cope with the situation.”

The story of Manhattan is especially impressive. Here
was an outstanding recreation program suddenly face to
face with a disaster condition. lts total resources were
needed to cope with the problem. Other communities which
suffered less know what their own recreation departments
had to do to help the homeless adjust to the stark reality
of the catastrophe. All those affected had to go into quick
action.

In Kansas City, Kansas, the day after the flood hit, play-
ground leaders were assigned to each of the six refugee
centers which had been established in schools. An exten-
sive play program for the children, crafts for the women
and movies every evening were continued as long as the
evacuation centers were in Operation.

Across the river, its sister city, Kansas City, Missouri,
also arranged for the shelter of hundreds of homeless.

llere, too, the recreation department staffed emergency
evacuation centers and provided a continuing program of
activities for all age groups. Grateful parents went about
the job of rehabilitation with the knowledge that their
children were happy and secure under the guidance of
professional recreation leaders.

In Salina, Kansas, where several schools and the Me-
morial Hall became evacuation centers, the staff of the
recreation department was on hand before the evacuees
began to move in. Crayons, comic books, coloring books
and simple toys were distributed to the children as they
arrived with their families. In the midst of adult confu-
sions and worry, the youngsters immediately began to
occupy themselves with play activities.

Recreation has come to be so closely identified with
the American way of life that its presence or absence in
a time of disaster or emergency may mean the difference
between getting cooperative action fully supported by
everyone or being faced with panicky uncertainty and un-
coordinated nluddling through.

The experience of these communities, and the way in
which they coped with the emergency, may provide some-
thing of a pattern for the more than seven hundred full-
time, tax-supported community recreation departments and
the hundreds of part-time programs in cities and towns all
over America, should they be called upon to go through
a similar crisis. Natural disasters may strike any com-
munity. Furthermore, should the atomic bomb be un-
leashed, the threat of devastation to all communities would
be increased many-fold. An emergency recreation pro-
gram, to be ready for any disaster, therefore, should be
a part of every community’s planning.

From the stricken city of Manhattan, Frank Anneberg
wrote: “I believe that every community recreation depart-
ment should plan a program that might be carried 011
during, and following, any disaster-,-—be it flood, fire, tor-
nado or atomic bombing.”

 

Secretary of Park Planners Retires

Thomas S. Settle, who, for twenty
years, has acted as secretary and legal
advisor of the National Capital Park
and Planning Commission, retired on
November 1, at the age of seventy. As
a young man, Mr. Settle joined the
field staff of the National Recreation
Association, then known as the Play-
ground Association of America, and
remained with the organization from

1913 to 1929. Most of his field work
was in the South, where he was very
much beloved. He was the first staff
person to give assistance to communi-
ties in that area in organizing recrea-
tion services for Negroes. During the

JANUARY 1952

first World War he was active in War
Camp Community Service, aiding
communities in providing recreation
for service personnel and war workers.

Thomas S. Settle is a graduate of
the law school of the University of
Virginia and, before coming to the as-
sociation, was state supervisor of rural
elementary schools in Virginia. He is
a native of that state.

In relinquishing his official duties
with the Planning Commission, Mr.
Settle by no means intends dr0pping
his active interest in civic affairs. He
will resume the private practice of law
and states: “I will continue to ride my
hobby, which has always been to make

Washington better and more beauti-
ful.” Also, he plans somehow to find
time to remain active in the Chamber
of Commerce, Board of Trade, Com-
mittee of One Hundred for the Nation-
al Capital and other affiliations having
to do with the improvement of Wash-
ington.

Upon his retirement, John Nplan,
Jr., director of the commission, paid
him tribute as one who “has made an
outstanding record in the legislative
field” and who has been “involved in
the initiation of most of the largest
recreational, park and civic improve-

ments from which Washington has
benefited in years.”

FOUNDING 'rHE Vallejo Clown Club
in June 1951 merely was a matter
of placing an article in the local news-
paper requesting all interested per-

District, California, at the local recrea-

ship has since grown to twenty-four.
Among others, it includes a welder,
shipyard foreman, mail carrier, car-
penter, cabinetmaker, teacher, two stu-
dents and four feminine members.
Our first two meetings were held
for the purpose of organizing the club;
but, for the third meeting, I secured
some greasepaint and we tried creat-
ing sample clown faces. Our first at-
tempts were a greasy mess but, mixed
with a tremendous amount of laugh-
ter, the idea soon took hold. It is
very important to remember that no
clown may copy the exact face design
of another. In fact, many professional
clowns even have a copyright for their
particular “face” so that no one else
may duplicate it. Since our initial at-

zine we could find, and had attempted
to figure out possible costumes. Mem-
bers brought in oversized coats, pants,
brightly-colored shirts and striped gar-
ments which might be used. One’s own
imagination is the best source for cos-
tume ideas, and assembling a costume
at home proved to be fun for the wives
who Were not active participants in
the club programs. For the oversized
shoes, a most important item in the
clown costume, we secured a sizable
amount of scrap leather from a leather-
processing plant in San Francisco.
Then, we obtained shoe imprints from
the clowns in Clown Alley of the Clydc
Beatty Circus. Members next took some
scrap leather, for the soles and tops
of their shoes, to the local cobblers,
who made up all the shoes for the
small sum of $3.50 per pair.

Dick Rasmussen, a forcman at Mare
Island Naval Shipyard, found that
a painter’s hood worked very nicely
for a white headpiece. Mrs. Mercedes
(Mickey) Griffen, a very reserved and
dignified accountant from Mare Is-
land, conceived the idea of painting
three-inch eyelashes upon her eye-
lids and forehead. Malcom Quidart
brought his wife to help him put on
his makeup and ended by convincing
her that she also should try a sample
face. We believe that having women
participate in our club adds more
fun to our venture.

We have no regular training course
other than that of practicing tech-
niques and methods of applying make-
up, about which we learned a great
deal from Ringling Brothers circus
clowns, when they appeared in nearby
cities Stockton and San Francisco. New
mcmbers need only have the interest
and desire to become clowns. As soon
as their shoes and costumes are de-
signed, they are given an immediate
opportunity to appear at some func-
tion. They learn by doing and by
watching other members.

Each clown carries little gadgets
which become a part of his act. For
example, one of my props is a broom
with which I sweep around someone
who is sitting down, usually an elderly
lady. After cleaning up all imaginary
dirt and carefully cleaning the scat
beside her, I proceed to turn around
and sit down upon the lady’s lap. Also,
I have some talking teeth which, when
wound up, give a “clickety-clack”
sound. These bring a laugh—particu-
larly when used near a group of wom-

RECREATION

en busily talking together. Another
clever gadget is a red handkerchief
on the end of a three-foot elastic band,
which is tossed out in front of a per-
son walking past, only to return and
disappear into the clown’s hand. This
usually causes the startled passerby to
jump. One clown spins metal platters
on the end of a cane. Another, called
“Bubbles,” blows soap bubbles for thc
children. A man and his wife do a
dance together. One of our clowns
drags a toy horse; another, a rubber
lizard; one pushes a carpet sweeper.
Larger props which might be used
are tandem bicycles or a unicycle; a
midget cannon which shoots oranges—
projected by means of a spring in the
barrel—to children; a baby buggy
with a special handle on the side
which, when pulled, causes the body
of the buggy to spring up. The last
works well in parades on a down-
grade, because the buggy rolls half-
way down the hill with the clown
mother frantically running after it. Of
course, the clown baby applies the
brake at the right moment. A far-off
dream for our club is to own an old
Model T Ford, with the usual explo-
sives, spouting water and backfiring,
and/or a compressed-air calliOpe.
From the time of the organization,
our group has participated in twenty-
six different functions—benefits, pa-
rades, youngsters’ parties, seven coun-

Assembling costumes is great fun, gives scope to
imagination. No clown may copy another’s face.

 

ty fairs and one state fair, three hos-
pital tours—including one through a
mental hospital, a PTA family night,
the Mare Island carnival and queen
contest, a Soroptimist Club district
banquet, a gas station opening and a
defense bond rally—a total of forty-
two appearances in which one to eleven
of our clown members were present.
We have appeared on four radio
broadcasts, which have taken the form
of interviews, featuring questions and
answers as to how the club originated
and our activities, with the announcer
describing our costumes.

The reaction of parents, children,
fair managers, patients and people in
general has been most gratifying. One
of the thrills of our service is in hav-
ing some youngster drag his mother
or father over to one of us and want
to shake hands or be lifted up to kiss
the clown. I believe that every clown
has had his long shoes stepped upon so
much that the majority of them are
Hat on t0p. Edward G. Vollman, fair
manager of the San Joaquin County
Fair, Stockton, remarked: “I am sure
that many youngsters, as well as adults,
will long remember the fine work of
your group, for it was undoubtedly
one of the thrills of our final day and
added to the delight of everyone.”

While playing at the fair grounds
in Stockton, I was given a very close
appraisal by three members of one

 

of the world’s largest circuses. Not
only were they very gracious in their
remarks about our club and our re-
spective parts, but they also compli-
mented me by suggesting that I join
the circus as a professional enter-
tainer!

One of our special novelties is to
make up and don our costumes before
an audience—whether we’re on the
stage or in various store windows in
cities where we are to perform. This
part of our program is advertised in
advance and not only has stimulated
interest, but has also added to the
cnjoyment of all concerned. None of
the effectiveness of our performances
seems to have been lost thereby.

Last September, the St. Helena har-
vest festival program noted that, on
Sunday, from eleven o’clock to noon,
five stores would feature in their win-
dows ten of our members donning
character makeups. Long before the
appointed hour, from one hundred to

150 children and adults waited before

each store—noses pressed against the
windows.

Although we have been too busy to
set up routines as yet, we have found
it best for every clown group to have
at least one or two fifteen-minute skits
in which each member may partici-
pate. Also, I have been gathering more
clown clothes and pr0ps and plan to
include in our club and banquet en-
gagements demonstrations of makeup
and costuming, using members of the
audiences. At the recent gas station
opening, eight clowns were used over
a two-day period—each working four-
hour shifts—and, for their efforts,
they each received seven dollars. So
we are now preparing an expense
scale, which can be used next year for
three different-sized fairs here in the
bay area.

We would like to start a clown band
——-highly disorganized as to march-
ing formation—which is usually an
attraction for young and old alike.
When our members have perfected and
speeded up their makeup technique,
they hope to make an appearance on
a television program, an activity which
would present possibilities for many
similar organizations in the United
States.

“Clowns unlimited” is our belief.

In making available
this volume,1 which re-
cords progress in the design of school
buildings during the past decade, the
Architectural Record has rendered a
genuine service to all who are con-
cerned with the planning and use of
school buildings. The 456 pages, com-
piled by Kenneth Reid, profusely illus-
trated with photographs and plans, are
of special interest to professional rec-
reation workers and to laymen con-
cerned with the provision of recreation
in their communities. School buildings
of all types, from every part of the
country, are shown. Here are plans,
details and photographs; articles by
recognized authorities on many phases
of school planning and design; analy-
ses of school costs; building types;
studies and orderly presentations of
design data.

Recreation workers will find authori-
tative support for the growing concep-
tion of school buildings as centers of
neighborhood and community life.
They will find opportunity for observ-
ing the design and construction meth-
ods applicable to such buildings. The
following excerpts from articles in the
volume2 illustrate the nature of the in-
formation it contains, although they
do not begin to give a true picture of
its scope and value.

Leading educators emphasize the
importance of planning school build-
ings for community use. Dr. Thomas

cxanlple, points out that little attcntion
has been given to thc plant and equip-
ment implications of the community
school, yet such considerations greatly
influence the practicability of a com-
munity-school program.

Among many suggestions, he offers
the following: (1) Site should be of
sufiicient size to provide recreation op-
portunities, not only for the school,
but for the community. There should
be ample space for community park-
ing. (2) _Music room, auditorium and
gymnasium, whether planned separate-
ly or in combination, should, as a
group, have an independent entrance
and be so planned that they can be
shut off from the rest of the building.
It is essential that toilet facilities be
provided in that part of the building
open to the publie. (3) Kitchen, com-
plete and independent, to be used
principally for community purposes,
should be so planned that it opens
either into the regular school cafeteria
or the gymnasium . . . (4) Shops and
laboratories should be planned and
equipped to serve both the school and
the community. Separate tool rooms
and storage space for supplies and
equipment may have to be provided
for community use. (5) Lockers and
dressing rooms for adults, in addition
to those for school children, are de-
sirable for the gymnasium. Where
funds permit, it is likewise desirable
that separate showers be provided.
(6) Library with outside entrance,
and of sufficient size for community
use, is desirable. (7) Heating and
ventilating systems should be so de-
signed that each unit can regulate its
own temperature. (8) Student activi-
ties should have adequate space: at
least the equivalent of one classroom,
with sufficient storage spacc for all
types of activities—rehearsals, clubs,
school publications and so on. (9) In
small communities, particularly where
there are no satisfactory theatres, am-
ple provision should be made for show-
ing moving pictures.

Dr. N. L. Engelhardt, nationally-

known authority on school administra-
tion, in considcring schools alter tllc
war statcs: “The school of tomorrow
will distinctly be a community school.
The home, farm, factory, parks, li-
braries and museums are simply a few
of the educational resources of the
community which must be integrated
into the school program. The school
plant itself should include the IllllSClltll
of community acllievcments and re-
sources, and all school facilities should
be made available to all members of
the 'community . . . Schools must bc
planned to meet adults’, as wcll as chil-
dren’s, needs. They must be planned
specifically as the focus of redevclop-
nient of the lives of millions of youths
coming back from the war, as well as
of millions of stay-at-homes who will
need learning adjustments to the post-
war period of production.

“Future schools will be allotted more
land. America has an abundance of
land and more of it should be devoted
to cducational purposes . . . More c011-
structive planning must be donc for
out-of—door opportunities in physical
development. Our schools should be so
planned that there is inbred in children
a love for the out-of—doors. Sports ad-
justed to changing weather must be
lnanned.

“Camp should be an adjunct of thc
school—not camps for the summer
only, but for fall, winter and spring as
well. It will be to youth’s advantage
to learn to know nature in all its
moods and facets.”

John E. Nichols, architcct with the
Connecticut Department of Education,
observes: “Public agencies are learn-
ing more and more to work tOgether,
pooling their energies and rcsourccs,
cooperating rather than competing.
School buildings incrcasingly are be-
coming the headquarters for com-
munity programs . . .

“Buildings designed for this broader
function must encourage, by their lay-
outs, and provide the space and equip-
ment for, a variety of community en-
tcrprises . . . Thcrc should be oiiice

RECREATION

space for the recreation director. In
smallcr communities particularly thc
school will accommodate the public li-
brary scrvicc and will serve as a
governmental center, containing the
necessary town offices and space for
voting and other governmental func-
tions. Nor will this community use
continue to be confined to out-of-school
hours . . .

“School buildings increasingly will
be designed for sectional occupancy so
that various parts (auditoriums, gym-
nasiums, shops, laboratories, libraries)
may be used independently without
disturbance to the occupants of other
parts. This will require special atten-
tion to circulation, access, heating
and ventilating, soundproofing,
parking and so on. On the other
hand, dual use of the same facilities
by pupils and adults will require
careful consideration of storage
problems, for more materials will
bc in use . . . and unfinished work
will have to be put away to clear
for cach succecding group. Also,
additional facilitics will be providcd
for community organizations.”

l’rofcssor Arthur B. Mochlman,
of thc University of Michigan and
cditor 'of The Nation’s Schools,
adds: “Whether all or a few of the
community activities are encom-
passed within a single building, the
school plant itself would naturally
providc for a community auditori-
um, physical exercise, play and rcc-
reational areas, lunchroom and cafe-
terias and the rooms essential for small
community gatherings under any plan.

“At present, growth of the idea of
cooperation among different com-
munity agencies, with the public school
as the pivotal centcr, is much more
important than the specific form of a
building . . . The first requisite in the
development of the true community
school is the acceptance of the idea
by both board of education and pro-
fessional educators of the total com-
munity educational program in which
the school plays only a part. The sec-
ond is the idea of cooperation with
other community agencies and the pro-
gressive development of a long-range
plan for the execution of the idea. The
third stcp is the selection of a site
sufiiciently large to provide not only
for buildings and park arcas, but also

JANUARY 1952

for large recreation areas and gen-
erous spacc for beautification. No site
of lcss than forty acres should be con-
sidered for a community sccondary
school center. The fourth step is the
execution of the plan through the co-
ordinated use of educational special-
ists, architects, engineers and land-
scape architects. The community
school should be financed by those
agencies cooperating in the total
project.”

Paul J. Misner, superintendent of
schools in Glencoe, Illinois, who points
out that education of a community’s
young people to be effective must be a
cooperative entcrprise, but that a com-

spaces and facilitics with adults. On
many enterprises, they can act proudly
side by side with the adniircd grown-
ups. There will be sh0ps for all,
stables, sties, a farmyard for animal
husbandry, a green nursery and gar-
dens. Of course, the small children will
have their suitable play equipment and
picture book library wing. But the
playfields, the library, the hall for
physical education and community
dances, as well as the cafeteria and the
health ccnter, will make up a good
manifold investment because of mul-
tiple usage. All age groups will avail
themselvcs of these facilities, some-
times mixed, sometimes separately, ac-

munity school cannot be something
worked out only on paper as a theory,
says: “There must be facilities which
the community recognizes as its own
to use and enjoy in abundant
measure . . . No greater single respon-
sibility faces the designer of school
buildings than that of planning to
serve community needs and interests.”

Richard J. Neutra, widely-known
California architect, presents a com-
prehensive diagrammatic plan showing
the community school functionally re-
lated to the neighborhood center. He
points out that the programming is
half the job and that the selection of
an ample site in the heart of a human-
scalc neighborhood is a good deal of
the balance. He remarks: “As in the
days of the pioneers and the home-
steaders, children may again sharc

cording to a schedule of allocatcd use
periods . . .

“The auditorium, the band rehearsal
room and the exhibition ball will bc
plaees where acoustical and visual
treats for the community will be in
frequent preparation—a process in-
valuable for children to watch. Dis-
cussion clubs and playrooms will re-
vive the functions of the old-time town
meeting, and may equally serve thc
week-end activities of many adoles-
eents and adult clubs and associations.
The entire plant, used most of the
hours of the day and all days of the
ycar, may well be tested and proved
in terms of square-foot-hours of full
usage! This ean serve as the livability
index of the layout . . . ”

In an article entitled “Neighbor-
hood Schools,” President Ernest O.

457

Melby, of Montana State University,
defines the ideal neighborhood as one
in which “a group of peOple live to-
gether in such ways as to promote the
constant growth and development of
all members regardless of age. The
program of the neighborhood school
must include a great deal of music,
art, literature, recreation and healthful
social living. Since the neighborhood
school is to serve the entire com-
munity, it should be planned with that
service in mind.”

Among many other Specific sugges-
tions, he adds: “Adequate provision
will be made in the neighborhood
school for the enjoyment of music.
The auditorium should be provided
with acoustical treatment, comfortable
seats and proper control of lighting in
order to make for the most satisfactory
conditions . . . A well-insulated listen-
ing room should be provided with a
good phonograph and records . . . At
least one large studio should be pro-
vided for the graphic arts and a shop
for industrial arts, as well as adequate
quarters for home arts.

“Finally, the plant should be beauti-
ful in exterior and interior design, in
decoration, furnishing and all appoint-
ments . . . This should be matched by
beauty of landscaping and care of
school grounds.”

Throughout the volume, examples of
modern school buildings and con-
sideration of their use are illustrated
by the following brief excerpts:

Central School, Cato-Meridian, New York:
“There are availahle facilities for adult edu-
cation, entertainment, participation in, and
attendance at, sports and opportunities for
practical use of the school plant in daily
activities. For instance, local farmers can

weld machinery or use the agricultural
shop.”

Six community schools, Davenport, Iowa:
“Community kitchens are so located as to
be accessihle from the community rOOm,
gymnasium and separate service entrance."

Central School, Rhineheck, New York:
“Community needs are met in a well-knit
group of units. Delivery is easy hoth to the
kitchen and the auditorium. The kitchen
easily can serve the cafeteria, the gymnasium
or the auditorium. The gym can be divided
down the center for simultaneous separate
use by hoys and girls, with direct approach
for hoth from their respective locker rooms.
Music rooms and the stage-craft room are
well related to the auditorium, and there is
a separate small stage in the cafeteria. The
entirc group can he easily closed off from
the classroom section.”

Litchfield Consolidated School, Wayne
County, Michigan: “The agricultural de-

458

partment is located adjacent to the experi-
mental gardens. The cannery is made availa-
hle to farmers. The shops aid them in main-
taining their mechanized implements. The
athletic field, gymnasium, auditorium and
lihrary are intended for community use. The
placement of the lihrary at the center of the
plan is excellent . . . The auditorium, to be
converted out of an existing gym, is cor-
rectly flanked by dramatics and cluh rooms."

Creston School, Portland, Oregon: “The
school hoard specified that the kindergartcn,
nursery, auditorium and gymnasium _should
he so arranged as to hecomc part of the
community life. All of these elements are
grouped together, except the gymnasium,
which has a position contiguous to a public
playground which already is under opera-
tion. The community facilities can be used
separately at times when the remainder of
the school is locked up.”

New Willard School, Stamford, Connecti-
cut: “One of the basic details was that the
auditorium and gymnasium should have
ample and independent access so that, in
addition to routine school uses, they could
be used hy the community for evening
gatherings; thus a single puhlic lobby
serves both of these rooms.”

Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan:
“Many of the rooms can be cut oil from the
rest of the building, for community use, hy
rolling doors which close across the corri-
dors. These rooms include: oiliee, library,
auditorium, shops, music department, cafe-
teria and kitchen, gymnasiums, locker rooms,
natatorium, Scouts room, taxidermy labora-
tory, janitors’ work room and a section of
classrooms. And each room has a separate
heating and ventilating unit, to allow its
use when the rest of the building is closed."

Many features of the volume, unre-
lated specifically to community,use of
schools, also are of special interest to
recreation authorities. One entire sec-
tion is devoted to building for athletics
and recreation. It includes valuable in-
formation on planning the gymnasium
and stadium and includes photographs
and plans of several buildings and
structures designed primarily or ex-
clusively for recreation. Other articles
deal with the industrial arts, labora-
tory, the library and the auditorium,
or with subjects such as lighting or au-
dio-visual facilities, all of which make
the book an exceedingly useful refer-
ence guide.

One phase of school planning on
which one looks in vain for material,
however, is the question of enlisting
the cooperation of recreation authori-
ties in the development of school plant
programs. Community use of schools
for recreation is widely accepted. In
actual practice, community recreation
programs in school buildings are large-
1y conducted and administered by mu-
nicipal recreation departments and not
by the school authorities themselves.

In a 1950 study, conducted by the Na-

tional Recreation Association, the only
major difficulty listed by recreation
authorities as threatening cooperation
in the operation of school centers was
the fact that buildings were not planned
for recreational use. It is therefore en-
couraging that, at the National Recrea-
tion Congress in Boston, October 1951,
a session on cooperative planning of
areas and facilities revealed that, in a
considerable number of cities, recrca-
tion authorities are consulted in the
development of new school building
plans or have an Opportunity to review
them in advance of construction. If
recreation authorities are to be given
increasing responsibility for operating
school plants outside of regular school
hours, it is reasonable to believe that
the programs will be more successful
if these authorities share in the plan-
ning process.

Changes in Minnesota State

Hospitals

There have been several changes in
the recreation programs of Minnesota
state hospitals since the publication in
RECREATION, September 1951, of the
article, “Recreation in Minnesota State
Hospitals.” Mr. Chapman, supervisor
of Patients Program Services, writes:
“An over-all revision of the salary
scales is as follows (as contrasted with
the older salary ranges):

Position Monthly Safary Range

Patient Activity Worker“ $219249
Patient Activity Leader 1* 5244-284
Patient Activity Leader II“ $284324
Patient Program Supervisor I $350400
Patient Program Supervisor 11 3481-541

*Formerly titled “Recreation Worker” or
“Leader I or II”—duties the same. Person-

nel in our hospital recreation series now
totals ninety.

“It was mentioned that room, board
and laundry were available for thirty
dollars monthly to each such employee
who resided on institutional grounds.
In most of our hoSpitals this figure has
been raised to thirty-five dollars per
month.”

N THE COLORADO ROCKIES, handi-

capped children go camping—the
nine-year-Old who had polio one au-
tumn, the “blue baby” now eleven,
who can’t compete with normal chil-
dren, the spastic who has never walked
alone. At first they went camping up
North Turkey Creek, Colorado, in a
mountain valley which is cool and
green all summer.

Handi Camp was established in 1947
as a co-educational, interracial and
interdenominational experiment, and
carried on through a special commit-
tee of Denver summer camps. After
several years of experimentation, this
group helped to make possible the
permanent site. The camp is now Op-
erated by the Colorado Society for
Crippled Children and Adults. It has

a permanent location near Empire,
Colorado, about forty-five miles west

of Denver. The camping season runs
for two months and includes boys and
girls from eight to seventeen years of
age. While no child is excluded from
camping because of lack of funds, par-
ents who are financially able are ex-
pected to contribute towards the camp.
In addition, service clubs, churches,
civic groups, individuals and organiza-
tions contribute camperships, costing
sixty dollars. The sponsoring organiza-
tion is a state-wide society, and chil-
dren come from all over the state as
well as from surrounding areas.
The present director is a graduate
of the New York School of Social
Work, specializing in group work. Per-
sonnel for the camp includes a regis-

THE HANDI CAPPED
GO CAMPING

tered nurse, six counselors (three men
and three women), two cooks and a
maintenance man. The camp is not
designed for therapy, but is set up to
provide a social and recreational out-
let. Thirty-five campers attend camp
for two or three weeks.

The First Adventure

When the eight-to-ten-year-olds ar-
rived that first summer, the girls were
in the minority. They totaled only
seven of the group of eighteen campers
and, as a result, lost in the camper
elections for storekeeper, banker and
other camp government positions.

Half Of the children were on crutches;
many had braces; one wore a cast;
TO all, except one, camping was a
brand new experience. All were full of
curiosity and spent their first hours
investigating everything. There was
the small stream, North Turkey Creek,
which meandered from one end of
camp to the other. Almost at once,
improvised boats of scrap wood were
being sailed by campers from the
bridge which spanned the creek. There
were the barracks with wooden bunks,
quite different from city beds. And,
most important of all, there was
the kitchen where Minnie, the cook,
dreamed up special things to eat.

thn it came to play, the campers
could wear out the counselors in no
time, especially with the bean bags.
These were substituted for balls which,
it was foreseen, would all end up Hoat-
ing down Turkey Creek. The dodge-
ball games were noisy, hilarious af-
fairs, which usually ended abruptly
with the nurse calling for time out.
That was the difliculty of the game--
no one knew when to stOp. But it was

of the utmost importance to halt any
kind of play before the campers be-
came worn out. Handicapped boys and
girls use more energy than average
children and tire more readily.

“John’s caught a fish,” shouted the
boys from the bridge one day. Sure
enough he had; it almost was a mira-
cle. The boys would break off a wil-
low branch, attach some string, a bent
pin and a fish worm and prOp it on
the bridge; then they would walk off.
And yet John had caught a fish; or,
maybe, it had caught itself! Anyway,
that was the event which sent the
boys’ unit—eleven strong—off on a
fish bake the following day. A fish,
the campers found, could be compli-
cated. You had to get it cleaned and
dipped in various things before you
could think of baking it in a reflector
oven. Obviously someone had to col-
lect firewood; and, worse still, some-
body had to build a fire that would
burn just right to heat the oven. This
was strictly a masculine outing, but
all the fellows reported that the fish
got thoroughly baked and that every
boy had a bite of fish.

The boys no sooner had come back
with remarkable tales of the fish bake
than our seven little girl campers be-
gan to act mysteriously and to whis-
per about a “blushing bunny.” The
boys ignored the feminine excitement
until the girls disappeared about lunch
time one day and didn’t come back to
camp until late afternoon. They might
have guessed. The girls had discovered
a likely Spot up the valley and had
hiked up there to cook themselves a
colorful concoction of tomato soup and

cheese, known as “blushing bunny.”
While the boys spent their rest hour

459

in the barracks as usual, the girls
spread their blankets beneath a tree
and took it easy on mattresses of green.

Need for Understanding

The counselors also had their prob-
lem children. But the problems which
were most \serious were not those of
physical handicaps at all; they were
mental ones which might snare any
child under similar circumstances.
There was Irene, a shy youngster when
she first arrived in camp. She never
spoke of her parents, but camp records
revealed that she came from a broken
home where tension was high. Irene
didn’t develop any close friends among
the campers. Instead, she insisted upon
trailing the counselors and being with
them whenever possible. As the camp-
ing period neared its close, Irene be-
came defiant about returning to her
home and expressed her unhappiness
by being mean to campers she re-
garded as below her in popularity. She
was almost recovered from polio, but
shc also suffered a mental hurt from
which she might never recover.

Alice and Leonard both were insti-
tution childrcn who very strongly felt
a lack of affection in their lives. Like
lrene, they spent most of their time
trying to gain the attention of the
counselors by any means that worked
——pinching, poking or grabbing an
arm. They, too, needed the love and
affection which were lacking in their
daily lives and knew of no other way
to get them. Counselor understanding
was of the utmost importance.

Then there was Bobby, eight years
old, who could walk without crutches,
but with some difficulty. He was be-
wildered by the counsclors who re-
fused to carry him when he decided
that making the effort to walk was too
much bother. At home, his parents
had given in to his whims, doing
everything for him. In camp, the coun-
selors would do nothing for him that
he could do for himself. Bohby didn’t
take such treatment happily, but it was
the only way he could learn to live
up to his capabilities. And there was
Margie, who had never done a thing
for herself in her nine years. It was
as much as your life was worth to
stand over her until she finished set-
ting a table or washing a dish. At the
moment, she was on crutches, but

one day she would be frce of them and
out in a world where responsibilities
would be thrown upon her, whether
she liked them or not.

A Construction Gang

When the eleven to thirteeners came
to camp, eighteen strong, they brought
with them different ideas of what con-
stituted fun. This time the boys and
girls were divided equally in number.
There were cardiacs, slightly pale and
worried-looking; there was a “blue
baby” who would turn almost black
if he exceeded the limitations of his
heart; there were the others who
limped slightly—the polios and spas-
tics.

The boys’ unit disappeared from
camp regularly each day to work on
a secret project. But “secret” was a
hope and nothing more. Everyone
knew that a lean-to was being built,
which would be off-bounds for the
girls. Such regulations were strictly
enforced. Not until visitors’ day was
the lean-to Opened for inspection. It
was built against the bank beside the
stream, the framcwork of dead fir
lashed firmly together. Pine boughs
across the roof kept out the rain—
theoretically. The boys strutted with
pride, and the girls were impressed,
beneath their nonchalance.

Sometimes in the late afternoons
the girls would appear dressed in their
best clothes, hair ribbons and lipstick.
Blue jeans were out. A rumor of folk
dancing had gotten around camp. The
boys showed no interest in prepara-
tions for the evening’s festivity. As
the hour arrived, at the far end of the
recreation hall the girls would wait ex-
pcctantly. The boys would gang to-
gether at the other end, wearing what
they had been fishing in all day. The
two groups might just as well have
been in separate camps. Then Mary,
who directed the folk dancing, finally
interceded.

“Everyone make a circle,” she said
quietly. The suggestion sounded inno-
cent enough and the Opposing fac-
tions joined hands. Someone put on
a record. “Will each girl select a boy
for a partner?” The boys found them-
selves exactly where the girls wanted
them!

Not all the dancers could do all the

steps. lt ust depended upon the handi-
cap. No one thought of being self-con-
scious; here you could trip over your-
self without getting a second glance.
I’ve never danced a gayer “Virginia
Reel” than those we did in the camp
for handicapped children. No wonder
the counselors were ready for bed long
before the campers were.

Then there was the costume ball.
Rules insisted that everyone had to
come in disguise or risk a penalty.
Amazing characters put in their ap-
pearance that evening: there was the
baby New Year, draped in a mammoth
towel; from one corner lumhered Ef-
fie, the cross-eyed elephant, wearing
overshoes to enlarge her feet to a con-
vincing size; a prim, old-fashioned
lady walked sedately about, shocked
by a grass-skirted charactcr skipping
around the hall. The first prize for
the best costume was a key to the
camp.

Unique Services of \Vorship

Sunday services in camp wcre origi-
nal and nondenominational. Since, at
timcs, the three major religions wcrc
rcprcscnted among the campers and
staff, the planning committees had their
problems. Most difficult of all was the
finding of even one hymn that every-
one knew well enough to sing. No mat-
ter which group of campers planned
a service, the inevitable choice was
“The Old Rugged Cross.” Everyone
at least knew the tune. One committec
followed the song idea through by
constructing an “old rugged cross” of
logs.

This, in turn, gave the campcrs an-
other idea for a service, which they
held at dusk one Sunday. They illumi-
nated the cross with flashlights and
placed it, with the help of counselors,
on a boulder in the middle of Turkey
Creek. It faced the outdoor chapel
where the campers gathered. That serv-
ice will long be remembered.

Christmas carols were heard during
one service because the committee dc-
cidcd that they were lovely enough to
be used more than once a year. No one
questioned the committee’s dccision.

Every religion represented contrib-
uted ideas to make the services in
camp a composite of everybody’s idea
of worship. If someone wanted a spe-
cial prayer, unfamiliar to the others,

RECREATION

copies were made so that everyone
might share it.

Among the last group of campers
were several who were severely handi-
capped, hut one of the outstanding
projects of the camping season was ac-
complished by the seven boys of this
teen-age group. This was a sleepoul.
The selection of a suitable spot took
careful searching, for the site had to
be accessible from the road since boys
on crutches would have to be brought
there by car. It also must be dry,
and yet near the stream. The final spot
selected was half a mile down the
valley, near an abandoned house which
would give emergency shelter.

The boys who weren’t on crutches
packed their own bed rolls on their
backs, along with a share of provi-
sions for two meals. With a counselor,
they hiked to the site which had the
special advantage of seeming remote
from the main camp, despite its actual
closeness. Those on crutches went by
car.

One problem to be solved upon ar-
riving at the site was. that of crossing
a stream over which there was no
bridge. The counselors had assembled
equipment for constructing a cable
across the stream, and the campers
eagerly worked under their supervi-
sion. When the cable had been secured
tightly to a tree on either side of the
stream, the boys improvised a seat
upon which to ride across.

“People wouldn’t think we were
handicapped if they could see us now,”
said Chuck, who had just made a
crossing. Never had anything so re-
markable happened to him, for he
always had been on crutches. For the
first time in his fifteen years, he was
riding a cable and sleeping out!

In the area of crafts, a particularly
outstanding crafts project was com-
pleted by a sixtieen-year-old girl on
crutches. The redwood marimba on
display attracted Dorothy the first day
in camp. At the first opportunity, she
began to saw wood for her own ma-
rimba. Such a project requires an in-
finite amount of patience, since the
tones are dependent upon the lengths
into which the wood is cut. To arrive
at accurate intervals, Dorothy had to
sandpaper the ends of the wooden
strips to raise a tone and shave the
lengths to lower the tone. Without a

JANUARY 1952

piano, the job was all the more ex-
acting. But Dorothy wasn’t afraid to
do difficult things. By the end of the
two-weeks’ session, she had completed
a thirteen-note marimba, upon which
she could play almost any tune she
pleased.

The nine girls of this teen-age group
decided to make a council ring for out-
door campfires. That meant a siege
with the hoes and rakes, during which
grass had to be pulled out and the
area levelled with sand. I’m quite cer-
tain that those-on crutches did fully
as much work as the others. They
were adept at balancing themselves and
wielding whatever tool the occasion
demanded. No one worked very hard
or very long at a time, but the ring
was finished by late afternoon, when
a rainstorm came up and obligingly
dampened it.

Camps for handicapped children are
all too rare. Certainly the youngster
who is handicapped needs a group ex-
perience of this sort even more than
the normal child. Many have previous-
ly been unable to associate with other

boys and girls or to learn much about
getting along with others in a camping
experience. More camps should be
made available for the handicapped
and more of the handicapped should
take advantage of them. The movement
is growing; but it needs the support
and understanding of the socially-
mindcd everywhere.

452 RECREATION

\

 

Games especially good for any group of
young people—in community centers, Y’s,
churches, industries or for the armed serv-
ices at home or anywhere. Try them at

your next party.

 

WHAT IS THE STANDARD of measurement for a good

game? The first and most important quality of a
good game is this: those who are participants must give
clear, observable evidence that this is an activity which
they genuinely enjoy. This means that it precipitates an
atmosphere of fun, of merriment. At the same time, such a
game should possess the quality of interest. If it leads to
quick boredom, it is not a good game. A good game is

one which is well-selected for the purpose in mind.———

Eduard C. Lindeman, Professor of Social Philosophy, New
York School of Social Work, Columbia University, (re-
tired).
Song Scramble

Select several songs known to the group at your party.
Write each line of each song on a separate slip of paper.
When the guests arrive, give each a slip. The guests are to
find the other players who have the same song, arrange
the lines in the right order and sing the song as soon as
they can. The group that sings its song first wins.

It is surprising how unfamiliar a well-known song can
look when all one sees is an isolated sentence.

Sometimes a group finds that only one line is missing
and has to do quite a bit of searching for the missing
player.

Who Am I?

Here’s a good mixer, with everyone asking questions of

each other at the same time.

JANUARY 1952

Pin slips of paper, with the names of well-known per-
sons, living or dead, upon the backs of the guests as they
arrive. Then let them try to find out their own identity
from each other. Of course, they can see the names of
everyone else—but not their own.

Players cannot ask the same person more than one ques-
tion at a time. They must go from one person to another.
Answers can only be given in the form of “yes” or “no.”
When a player thinks he knows his identity, he doesn’t say
anything until he has his host confirm it.

For example: a player asks, “Am I a general?” or “Did
I fight against England?” and so on. He does not ask, “Am
I George Washington?” He saves this type of direct ques-
tion for the host—when he feels he has guessed his identi-
ty. If he has guessed the wrong person, he keeps asking
others questions until he finally gets it right. After the
player guesses his identity, he rejoins the game as an
answerer.

The host can keep a record of the order in which play-
ers guess their name and declare the winner later. The
game is noisy and funny, because everyone is trying to
be the first to find out his identity. Players must also
answer questions put to them by others. (A word of cau-

tion to the host—cover or remove all mirrors.)

Dance With the Broomstick

For this dance, if you don’t have an equal division into
couples, it doesn’t make any difference if girls dance with
girls and boys with boys. Divide up, leaving one person
without a partner and give this brave volunteer a broom-
stick instead.

The leader plays a piano or phonograph. While the
music plays, the couples must dance—the guest with the
broomstick dancing too, just like the others. Suddenly,
when the music stops—even in the middle of a bar—every-
one must switch partners. The guest with the broomstick

pany, Incorporated, from 101 Best Games for Teen-Agers, by Lillian
and Godfrey Frankel. $2.00.

463

drops it and grabs the nearest partner. The person now
left without 'a partner gets the broomstick and the dance
continues. This is great fun for all, and a way of getting
people better acquainted.

Numbers

The host counts the number of guests present. Then he
calls out in the following manner: “We have thirty people
here. Now when I say, ‘Mix into three’s,’ I want you to
get into groups of three. When 1 call, ‘Mix into five’s,’ then
quickly get into groups of five and so on. Now ready!
Mix into three’s!”

This becomes lively, because the guests have to scurry
around and get into groups of the required size. There
usually is a great deal of borrowing and shuffling around
before the groups are all of the same number. The real
fun begins when you call out, “Mix into ten’sl” This is a
sure way to start off the party with a bang.

Musical Charades

This is a team game, played by the whole team acting
out the song as a complete scene, without performing each
syllable or word individually. When the song is guessed,
the performing team sings it. Verses can be acted out as
scenes in themselves or, if the identity of the song is clear
in one scene, then that is sufficient.

Here are a few songs with which to start off: “On Top
of Old Smoky,” “The Blue Tail Fly,” “On, Wisconsin,”
“The Whiffenpoof Song,” “September Song,” “Solitude,”
“Star Spangled Banner,” and “America, the Beautiful.” If
this form of charade proves too difficult, it is fair to tell
the group what kind of a song you are acting out—that is,
whether it is folk, jazz, popular, patriotic, show tune,
spiritual or collegiate. Musical charades are good for de-
veloping a singing period in your program.

Rhythm

After everyone is seated in a circle, the players start
to beat time. They get a rhythm by first slapping their
hands on their knees, then clapping their hands together
and then slapping their knees again. They keep this up
until, at the last beat, someone starts the game by calling
out a word.

Let’s make believe player “A” calls out the word “good.”
The group then goes through the rhythm of clapping
knees, hands, then knees. Right after the last motion, the
player sitting next to “A” in the circle must call out a
word beginning with the last letter of the previous word.
In this case, the player can call out “dog.” The group then
goes through the three rhythm motions again and the next
player may call out “gift.” If he had called out “good,”
he would have one point against him, because words
cannot be repeated.

The rhythm must be kept up this way: Clap, clap, clap,
word; clap, clap, clap, word; and so on. The game goes
very quickly because the rhythm is fast. After a player
misses three times, he is out of the game. A player can
miss by giving the name of a person or place or by failing
to give any word directly after the last beat of the rhythm.

Pass the Orange
Two or more teams of equal number are formed. The
player at the head of each team has an orange, which he

464

holds under his chin. The seeond person on each team has
to grab the orange with his neck and chin. llands cannot
be used. The movements and gestures which the players
go through in order to pass the orange become very
comical.

The first team to pass the orange to the last player in
line wins. If there are just a few members on each team,
the orange can be passed back in reverse order, from last
man to first, before the game is over. ll the orange drops
to the floor, the player cannot use his hands to pick it up,
but must pick it up with his neck and chin.

Last Couple Stoop

Partners, girl and boy, are chosen for this popular
game. The players form a circle, boys on the inside, girls
on the outside. Make sure that everyone knows his partner.
Members of the same sex can play this game the same
way—with partners.

When the music begins (piano or phonograph), the
outer circle walks clockwise, the inner circle counterclock-
wise.

When the music stops, partners run for each other, grab
each other’s hand and stool) down. The last couple to st00p
is eliminated and assists in helping to spot the next “last
couple to stoop.”

You’re In

In this intellectual game, a player starts by giving a
brief biography of some famous man or woman, telling it
in the first person. For example: “I know I’m a great wit.
Everything I’ve done that’s made me famous is evidence
of it. I used to have red hair and I associate with people
of the theatre.”

The present tense is always used, even in telling of some-
one dead. The biographer must be skillful enough to tell
facts and, at the same time, to keep the group from guess-
ing the name of the person in the biography. First person
is used for both men and women, regardless of the sex of
the player telling the story.

Now, as soon as a listener thinks that he knows the
name of the person, he asks a question. His question must
be a guarded one, because he doesn’t want to disclose the
identity to the rest of the group. If, by the question asked,
the biographer feels the questioner knows .whom he is
supposed to represent, he answers, “You’re in.” For ex-
ample: Player: “Did you ever have a spouse?” (It’s wise
to use “spouse” instead of “husband” or “wife” so the
group won’t know the sex of the person right off.) Bi-
ographer: “Yes.” Player: “Did you ever have dealings
with Cleopatra?” Biographer: “You’re in.” (The biogra-
pher assumes that the player knows that he has been repre-
senting George Bernard Shaw, because Shaw wrote Caesar

and Cleopatra.)

If the biographer is sure that the player is not hinting
at the right person, he says, “No, you’re not in'.” The bi-
ographer continues telling his story, bit by bit, and answer-
ing questions. As the game.procecds, the additional clues
make it easier. The players “not in” continue asking
questions until all, or almost all of them, are “in.” The
person who first guessed correctly becomes the biographer
for the next round.

PERSONN L

Because the following list of training opportunities had
to be made up in November for this issue of RECREATION,
the plans for many of the short-term training institutes
are not definite; however, final arrangements for these
usually are not completed very far in advance, in any
case. For the most part, the people serving on committees
and acting as chairmen for these training programs do so
on a volunteer basis, and cannot be sure of their availa-
bility too far ahead of time. They are full-time profes-
sional people with other major responsibilities, who have
seen the need for this type of training and are performing
these duties as extra services. If it were not for their
willingness to take on these additional responsibilities,
many of the institutes would never be held.

In some cases, the conferences are fairly well known
and the dates and locations vary little year after year. For
others, however, there is just enough information given so
that those interested will be able to investigate further
through the appropriate channels.

We are continuing to follow personnel identified with
these and other institutes. The leadership changes frequent-
ly, and it is diflicult to keep in touch with those in charge.
However, more specific information on these and a listing
of other institutes, as they are reported, will be published
at a later date.

Individuals interested in the institutes conducted by the
training specialists of the National Recreation Association
are referred to the schedule on the inside back cover of
each issue of RECREATION.

Make It Yourself

N INTERESTING challenge to hobby-

ists, crafts groups and all who
take pride in “making it themselves”
is offered by the Mak-a-Clok Kit, com-
bining the fun of creatiVe construction
with some cabinet-making and finish-
ing. Priced at $8.95, the kit contains
parts and instructions for making a
handsome, solid wood clock case for
installation and the self-starting Ses-
sions electric movement. The main
wood two-inch block is pre-drilled,
with a four-inch diameter hole to fit
the clock—which, incidentally, is pre-

assembled and in perfect working
order.

Details for wood finishing and six
designs in photographic, as well as
blueprint, form also are included.
Hobbyists may select one of the styles
or choose parts of each for creating
individual designs. For further infor-
mation, write to Bradley-Rogers Cor-

poration, 19 West Twenty-fourth
Street, New York 10, New York.

Stadium Seats

A new, improved model of its alumi-
num stadium seat is being featured by

All-Luminum Products, 43 N. Third

Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The new seat, strengthened and
modified in design to fit any stadium
or grandstand, is now available in
your local school or college colors,
with the school seal or letter printed

directly on the backrest. Priced at
$4.95 (two for $9.50), it is weather-

proof, waterproof and rustproof.

New Bulletin Boards

A great deal of attention is being
centered upon improving your bulletin
boards for maximum efficiency.

The A. C. Davenport and Sons Com-
pany, 311 N. Desplaines Street, Chi-
cago 6, Illinois, manufacturers of cork
back boards, bulletin hoards, plant

safety boards and other identification
devices, announces that a new develop-
ment to keep cork boards clean five
times as long as usual, even under
dusty conditions, is now being used in
the entire Dav-Son line. Its improved

surface coating is responsible for mak-

466

ing the board practically impcrvious
to dirt, grease and hand marks. Con-
stant use without painting or other

 

surface refinishing is among the other
advantages. The board can be had with

or without glass.

I- I' I-

The Bettercraft Company, at the
same address as Davenport and Sons,
has also completed a new bulletin
board, suitable for community centers,
playgrounds, schools, colleges, clubs,
offices, libraries—in fact, wherever a
bulletin board is a convenience.

This eighteen by twenty-four inch
composition board firmly holds thumb-
tacks, has a pin-up title heading and
border trim in various colors.

Touchdown in Rubber

Football history was made in At-
lanta, Georgia, on October 13, when
the Voit XF9 rubber-covered football
made its debut in the clash between
Louisiana State University and Georgia
Tech, reportedly marking the first time
in collegiate history that anything
other than a leather football had ever
bcen used in a major college confer-
ence contest.

The game climaxed years of experi-
mentation and tests for the Voit ball
and the XF 9 passed its test success-
fully. The new ball was originally
started four years ago and underwent

a number of trials in Los Angeles high
school and junior college games. Voit

plans to submit the ball for NCAA
Rules Committee adoption this year.

Incidentally, the game was won by
Georgia Tech, 25-7.

Gymnasium Equipment

Fred Medart Products, Incorporated,
announces the developmcnt of sevcral
new types of physical therapy and
gymnasium equipmcntwamong them,
the Medart Wet Spirometcr, using a
float chamber principle for precision-
testing of the lungs; a new Back and
Leg Dynamometer, for accurately test-
ing back and leg lifts up to 2,500
pounds; a Hand Manuometer, for
measuring hand grip strength; and thc
Pond-Medart Twisting Belt, designed
to help develop expert gymnasts and
tumblers in a short time. The last is
constructed in two scctions which
fastcn together with strong non-slip
tension buckles. Both the outside belt,
which holds an eye-ring support, and
thc inside belt are made of heavy duty
wcbbing, bonded under pressure into
an inseparable unit. Design and con-
struction prevent fouling or twisting
of all suspension ropes regardless of
the numher of body twists or somer-

games, according to these rules:

Playing Area: Any standard basket-
ball court.

Equipment: A regulation volleyball.

Players: At least ten and more. Ideal
with eight to ten on a side; there may
be as many as twenty on a team.

Line-up: Similar to that in man-t0-
man basketball.

Object: To score by tapping the
ball into the basket and to prevent
the other team from scoring.

Procedure: Start with a jump ball
at center as in basketball. Teamwork
consists of a series of volleys from
player to player.

Scoring: Same as in basketball.

Time: Two fifteen-minute halves of
straight running time.

Violations: Ball striking floor; ball
going out of bounds; catching ball;
more than two successive volleys by
one player (but any number of taps
can be made when rebounding oii
backboard in attempting to score);
striking ball with fist (repeated offense
invokes technical foul); ball striking
obstacles around court; and all others
covered in basketball code, except
back-court rule.

Pcnalty: Opposing team takes ball
out of bounds at closest boundary Iine
to violation. Ball is put back into play
with volleyball serve. It cannot be
blocked in this situation. When re-
sponsibility for violation cannot be de-
tcrmined, play is resumed, with jump
at nearest circle between the two play-
ers involved.

Fouls: Same as in basketball.

Penalty: One or two throws, as in

basketball. Free throw is taken by the
fouled player standing on foul line,
throwing ball into air for a setup and
trying to score with a volley.——~Rc-
printed from Scholastic Coach, Octo-

ber 1951.

New Films

V for Volunteers. National Film
Board of Canada. 16 mm.—sound—-——~
twenty minutes~——two reels. Available
through Association Films, Incorpo-
rated. This is a new, dramatically-ef-
fective documentary, produced through
the cooperation of the Canadian Wel-
fare Council, the Department of Na-
tional Health and Welfare and the
Association of Junior Leagues of
America. It dramatically illustrates,
through the experiences of a suburban
family, “too busy” to help with civic
activities, that volunteer work is every-
body’s business. A substantial part of
the picture deals with the need for,
and use of, volunteer help in public
recreation activities; and the inter-
vicwing and placement of the volunteer
are given good coverage. Having pre-
viewed the film in New_York, National
Recreation Association representatives
would like to call it to the attention of
local recreation departments as excel-
lent for use in interpreting to the com-
nlunity volunteer services as they can
apply locally, and for recruiting.

Corporation. Those interested in de-
velOping bands and smaller instru-
mental ensembles will derive inspira-
tion and ideas from this two-reel film,
a recent RKO-Pathé release. Invite
your music groups, particularly your
teen-agers, to see it. It features the
well-known University of Michigan
band performing at football games, in
marching formations and in various
action patterns, also covering the train-
ing of band members and the details
of planning new routines. It attractive-
ly dcmonstrates the educational, social
and recreational values of learning to
play an instrument. Check with your

Planning for Recreation

in Rural Areas—

Problems of rural life and educa-
tion in California have been the sub-
ject of discussion at four conferences
held in California citics under the
sponsorship of the California State
Department of Education. Many ques-
tions relating to the function of ru-
ral recreation, organization, faciliti-
ties, leadership and programs have
been discussed and recommendations
developed.

Features of rural conditions and ru-
ral living considered distinctive and
necessary in planning for recreation
are:

1. Many times, rural homes are
quite large and could be the center
of neighborhood activities, if this were
encouraged.

2. Playground apparatus for physi-
cal development is of minor impor-
tance, since such natural apparatus
as trees, fences, and irregular terrain
often present opportunity for climbing
and vigorous physical activities.

3. Rural school buildings usually
are centered within the community
and include many recreation facilities
which should be available on a year-
round basis.

4. School district transportation fa-
cilities may be used, if authorized by
the trustees, for transporting children
to the school, swimming pool, park,

playground and/or community center,
after school and week-ends during the
school year and during vacation pe-
riods. This is particularly important,
owing to the distances involved in
sparsely-populated areas.

5. Rural organization facilities often
are suitable as attractive meeting
places and recreation centers, as pro-
grams are developed.

6. Farm pets, hunting and fishing,
swimming, winter sports, study of
birds, butterflies and insects, astrono-
my and gardening provide inherent
opportunities for recreation in the ru-
ral environment and should be uti-
lized.

7. The rural recreation program
need not give much emphasis to segre-
gation by age groups and by sex,
as families normally participate as a
group in many social and physical ac-
tivities, and it is a normal pattern for
boys and girls to hold memberships in
the same clubs.

0f the recommendations, upon which
general agreement was reached, some
apply equally to urban communities,

but others are distinctly related to the

rural situation. Major recommenda-
tions include:

1. That adequate recreation serv-
ices, under properly constituted pub-
lic authority and with adequate pub-

Iic financing, be made availablc to all
people within the state.

2. That every county and rural com-
munity establish a legally-authorized
rccreation board or commission.

3. That all public authorities perlnit
fulI utilization of available facilities;
adapt present facilities for year-round
community use; plan, design and con-
struct buildings and facilities for year-
round community use, with emphasis
upon winter utility.

4. That thorough research and study
be initiated in order to establish es-
sential standards in rural recrcation.

5. That public and private agencies
cooperatc in jointly supporting and
conducting a recreation training pro-
gram for professional and volunteer
leaders.

6. That adequate salaries be pro-
vided to attract competent qualified
personnel to rural recreation.

7. That public schools make availa-
blc district transportation facilities for
community recreation purposes, where
needed. '

8. That the section relating to
training for leisure in the statement,
“Framework for Public Education in
California,” issued by the California
Framework Committec of the State
Curriculum Commission, be endorsed
as sound and comprehensive.

9. That state, county, school district
and city governments cooperate in es-
tablishing, promoting, conducting and
financing adequate public recreation
programs in rural areas.

Recreation for Older People
in California

Prepared in collaboration with Ameri-
can Women’s Voluntary Services of
California, Incorporated, and the
Department of Physical Education,
University of California, Los An-
geles. Printing Division, Documents
Section, State of California Recrea-
tion Commission, Eleventh and O
Streets, Sacramento 14, California.
Paper, $.50 plus tax.

This pamphlet, while it uses informa-
tion garnered in California, will be of
great interest and help to any com-
munities or organizations conducting
recreation programs for oldsters, or
planning to do so. It also will be valu-
able to volunteers and students inter-
ested in this phase of recreation.

The first of the four sections of this
pamphlet includes a six-page statement
about our aging p0pulation, the part
recreation plays, how it can be used
and community responsibility. This
section sets the stage for the more spe-
ciiic ones which follow.

The second section is on the organi-
zation and administration of senior rec-
reation programs. Its sixteen pages give
factual recommendations about Space,
facilities, finance, personnel and so on.

Section three consists of thirty pages
describing actual programs of this sort
in various California cities, each ac-
count giving specific and detailed in-
formation.

Section four consists of an annotatcd
bibliography of live pages, divided in-
to three headings—program activities,
general organization and administra-
tion and background material. Unfor-
tunately, it omits the many interesting
and important articles which have ap-

472

peared in RECREATION, as well as in
several other NRA publications on
these subjects.

However, it is good to see thought-
ful, accurate information of this sort
presented in a single inexpensive form.
We hope that, some time soon, a criti-
cal evaluation of centers and programs
for older pe0ple will be prepared by
some department or organization, so
that the many present different and de-
vious paths taken by such programs
can be analyzed, studied and construc-
tive recommendations made, based up-
on facts. In other words, the time will
soon come when we need to take stock.
Otherwise, there is a possible danger
that centers and programs for older
pe0ple may become as “faddy” and as
ephemeral as many teen-canteens of
several years ago.—Virginia Mussel-
man, Correspondence and Consultation
Service, National Recreation Associa-
tlon.

A Song in His Heart

John Jay Daly. John C. Winston Com-
pany, Philadelphia. $3.00.

Here we have the life story of one of
the great contributors to the American
treasury of folk songs, composer of the
ever-popular “Carry Me Back to Old
Virginny,” “In the Evening by the
Moonlight,” “Oh, Dem Golden Slip-
pers” and others, which have endeared
themselves to singing groups through-
out the land. The biography is fiction-
alized to some extent, for little is
known of the life of James Bland ex-
cept that he was born of free Negro
parents in Flushing, New York, in
1854, was a member of various min-
strel troupes and had a genius for turn-
ing out melodies.

Only thirty-five of his hundreds of

songs were copyrighted, and not more
than six or eight of these attained last-
ing fame, but much of his output was
incorporated into the minstrel shows of
the ’80’s and ’90’s or was adapted to
the use of other types of musical en-
tertainment, without credit to the com-
poser. Bland indeed was forgotten by
the public before half his life was over,
and he spent his latter years in practi-
cal destitution. It was not until the
past decade that interest was revived in
the “Negro Stephen Foster,” as he has
often been called, and posthumous hon-
ors accorded him. One of these was the
adoption of “Carry Me Back to Old
Virginny” as the oflicial song of that
state.

Mr. Daly’s book includes eight of
the better-known Bland songs, with
words, melodies and piano accompani-
ments. It also contains illustrations
nostalgic of the era before the sweep
of industry, when the minstrel show
was at its height and gave us songs
which we have not permitted to die.

Introduction to the book was written
by Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia,
who pays the following tribute to
Bland:

“Although the people of Virginia
owe a debt of gratitude to James Bland
for having given the Old Dominion
state its official song, his countrymen
in the other states are equally his bene-
ficiaries. During his lifetime, Bland
composed over sevcn hundred songs.
. . . Like Stephen Foster, . . . he felt
the spiritual quality of thc Negro race
and succeeded in putting his feelings
into words and 1nusic.”—Gertrude
Borchard, Correspondence and Con-
sultation Service, National Recreation
Association.

While personally leading his Infantry
company in an attack on a strongly held

position near Seam-Ni, Korea, Captain Mil-
lett noted that his 1st Platoon was pinned
down by heavy enemy fire. Ordering another
platoon to the rescue, he led a fixed bayonet

 

assault up the fire-swept hill. 1n the tra-
ditional Infantry spirit, Captain Millett
charged into the enemy positions, bayonet-
ing two of his foes, then shouting encour-
agement to his troops, continued throwing
grenades, and clubbing and bayoneting the
enemy. Inspired by his example, the attack-
ing unit routed the enemy, who fled in wild

disorder.
“It’s an uphill struggle,” says Captain

Millett, “to build a working peace. Unfor-
tunately, the only argument aggressors re-
spect is strength. Fortunately we’ve learned
this lesson in time.

“You can help build our strength—the
defense-line of peace—by buying United
States Defense Bonds. Every Bond is a dec-
laration to the world—especially to would-
be aggressors—that we aim to insure peace.

“I think a secure peace is worth working
for. If you think so, too, buy United States
Defense Bonds now.”

Remember that when you’re buying bonds for na-
tional defense, you’re also building a personal reserve
of cash savings. Remember, too, that if you don’t save
regularly, you generally don’t save at all. Money you
take home usually is money spent. So sign up today in
the Payroll Savings Plan where you work, or the
Bond-A-Month Plan where you bank. For your coun-
try’s security, and your own, buy United States
Defense Bonds now!

Peace is for the strong...
