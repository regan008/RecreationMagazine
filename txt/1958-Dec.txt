I “Ring out the old, ring in the new. . .” The first
. ‘ne of 1959 will start the New Year with a look
'l ead and a prcdiction for “Recreation Ten Years
the Fu:ure,” an article compiled by Bob Horney
thc NRA and based on the statements of a group
_ national leaders in the recreation field. January
ills, on the other hand, will be ignored by an
ticle on outdoor winter sports, “If Winter Comes
. . Get Out and Enjoy It!” It would seem that
ld-weather stay-at-homes are delicate relics of the
st. The issue will also include more information
the care of ice rinks; and an article on “Paddle
nnis Played Right,” which will carry the latest
Icial rules in time for spring championship play,
 (l instructions for veteran players or beginners.
ne more page of Congress photographs will pro-
_ ote further reminiscing about our excellent meet-
g last fall, and a spread of winning photographs
' om the excellent contest conducted by the New
ork City Park Department will show the sort of
ing that can he an effective part of National Rec-
- ration Month in local communities.

retarded young adults, the NRA Pro-
gram Department contacted the recrea-
tion chairman of the National Associa-
tion for Retarded Children, who has
had extensive experience with pro-
grams ]or the teen-age mentally retard-
ed. The following letter is excerpted
from her reply.

In many parts of the country can-
teens for mentally retarded young
adults are offering an opportunity for
these young peOple to get together in
mixed groups for sociability and rec-
reation purposes. The program de-
pends on what is available in the local
area. For one thing, these young peo-
ple are very fond of music and it would
be hard for me to conceive of any pro-
gram of this nature without a good
phonograph or jukebox and records of
some kind. If possible, I feel it is im-
portant to have an eXperienced, trained,
professional person,-who will under-
stand these adults and remember that
for a time there is much sheer joy just
being able to be with others. It is my
Opinion that a number of things can be
offered. Quiet games, such as checkers
and so on, could be set up in one cor-
ner; other more active ones, such as
Ping-pong, indoor horseshoes, and so
forth, can be“ at their disposal. Other
groups get real pleasure from dancing,
even though it may not be the most
polished ballroom dancing, or there can
be simplified folk dances; improvised
quiet games to help them get acquaint-
ed; and always food. If it is possible,
arts and crafts in a form of ceramics
and so on offer much satisfaction.

In our own local unit, we have had
tremendous success this last year, but
have found that the children were hap-
pier when we did not try to do too many
things. We contemplate starting a club
this next year with their having their
own officers and eventually taking field
trips. We feel that every other week

has been satisfactory, although we a
now starting a second canteen in a:
other area on alternate weeks so th
if they wish, they can have cante
every week.

It is my feeling also that, while
particular group may be older, th
still are children at heart, so that t
program for sixteen and over will
doubt be much the same for tho
twenty-six and over.

One word of caution, however;
some way, you should protect yours
so that if there are those who apply fc
admission who would be too disrupti
you are not obligated to keep them i
definitely. So much depends on t
schooling and previous experien
these retardates have bad. So far,
in our local unit, have never had
reject any and we have over sixty, b
all of them are taken in on a three—ti
trial basis. As a rule, their behavior
excellent, and we have found in m
instances that the trainable and edu
ble mix very well.

ieve it is basic to the implementation
of his other two corollaries. I believe
the reason that we, as recreators, do not
“expose the public to our philosophies
and purpose” and design our activities
to promote realistic objectives is that we
do not have a solid philosophy of recre-
ation in the heginning.

Appreciation from Sweden

Dear Sirs:

Please send me catalogue of your
publications. About twenty years ago
I got a lot of your books and have had
a good help of them. I am now old and
have finished my work as a principal at
Frobelinslibulet Narrkoping (training
college for nursery school and kinder-
garten teachers). I should have liked
to have more time for playground
work; now I hope to interest some
young pcople. We have some good play-
grounds in Sweden, but . . . we have no
special training, only a lot of good peo-
ple who try to do their best.

For some summers, I myself had a
very nice playground for children. I
am thankful for all the ideas I got from
your paper and books. I think you
Should have liked my small playground
with a very big sand box, water, play-
house, workbenches, books, chickens,
rabbits, and two sheep.

Wishing you all good for future work
and many thanks for all you have done
to keep a high standard on the play-
grounds.

These provocative statements, from Mr. Hechscher’s address at the
40th National Recreation Congress, sound the keynote of the
situation facing American recreation leaders today.

ECREATION has taken a wholly new

place in our lives. What used to be
the fringe has become, in a real sense,
the center. People are actually playing
without any feeling of guilt . . . [How-
ever] in the title of my text, I am sure
you will perceive some rather gloomy
undertones. It embodies a dilemma, one
that has troubled me as I have thought
about our common concern. Assuming
that recreation is good, the question is
whether we can afford to indulge in it
through so fateful an epoch.

When Adlai Stevenson returned re-
cently from his tour of the Soviet, his

first message to the American people
implied a somber warning. “ ‘Men
Working”? he said, “is the symbol of
the Soviet Union today. . . . The whole
gigantic power apparatus is harnessed
with ruthless, concentrated purpose on
increased production, higher living
standards, security and influence.”

This is characteristic of the under-

developed lands everywhere. . . . Popu-
lations, which for ages have slumbered
in ease, are suddenly waking. . . . Thus,

we have the image before us of a busy,
bustling globe; and an America en-
chanted by the prospects of new-found,
unheard of leisure. The tables are sud-
denly turned and the world seems to be
upside down. For centuries the people

tieth Century Fund. His complete
speech, from which the above is taken,

of the East have lived like philosophers.
Now they catch the shrewd Yankee note,
while we find ourselves asking what
there may be in the traditions of the
so-called backward people which can
help us spend our free time more wisely.

In this incongruity between our own
leisure and other people’s hard work
lies one of the primary tensions of the
world today and—conceivably—one of
the greatest threats to our country’s
security.

Faced with this situation, what does
one say? How do you answer someone
who asks how you can seriously pre-
occupy yourself with recreation when
so many urgent tasks wait to be ac-
complished?

I think I would begin my own search
for an answer by suggesting that busi-
ness by itself is not necessarily an as-
surance of national strength. Produc-
tion is not a guarantee of greatness. The
real question is what purpose animates
and guides one’s activity; it is to what
end one’s productive resources are de-
voted. If we are to hold our own in
the world, are we really condemncd to
turn out more and more consumer
goods, often goods which we do not
need—-—or only think we need? . . . I
hardly think so. We can very well
afford to go a little slow in some sectors
of the economy. . . . Production does
not necessarily make us strong, par-
ticularly if it means using up raw ma-
terials at a needless rate and creating

in‘a World at Wor

’ Editorial

 

AT PLA a

consumer goods that are obsolcte befo
they are old.

To the apostles of toil and stress
would say, therefore, that they shou
pause and wipe their brows. Th

 

should learn not to confuse mere m
terial abundance with our nation’s :_|
curity and true welfare. . . . Let us ke I
our perspective; let- us cultivate a sa
capacity to distinguish between t
things that are important to us, as i
dividuals or as a nation, and those th
are not. Then we shall be in a positio
at least, to establish some sensible pr
portion between work and leisure—
defend our hours of recreation again
being invaded and eaten into by usele
toil.

And yet, we all know there are gre
tasks waiting to be done on this con
nent of ours. . . . I would not ur

of science and of space. If we can g

Much hard work is still required of
————on this continent and on this plan
And so I come to the second part of
argument.

Recreation and work are not in

RECREATI L

cases opposed to each other—indeed
they are often inseparany linked, as op-
posite sides of the same coin.

In the present state of things we
must be able to show that recreational
activities make vital contributions to the
common life; that recreation in work,
and work in recreation, provides the
condition of a country’s true happiness,
lrue crcativeness, true productivity.

Is a man’s work better because of the
diversions he pursues in hours away
from the job? Is his intelligence quick-
er, his morale higher, his skill more
subtle? Does he, in this age of leisure,
go about the day’s work with a readier
acceptance of all its ups and downs:
with a capacity to deal imaginatively
with what is unforeseen in its develop-
ments? In too many cases an affirma-
tive reply would be misleading. . . . Yet
it is not beyond reason to hope that a
people which has learned the real uses
of recreation will be fortified, rather
than diminished, by leisure-time activi-
ties. The ideal of recreation is not only
to make recreation more delightful but
work more rewarding—in actual fact to
make it more efficient.

Much of what we think of as recrea-
tion contributes directly or indirectly
to the total output of a society. In great
ages of the past the so-called leisure
classes have nurtured those who wrote
the books, conducted the voyages of dis-
covery, ruled the land, produced the
works of art, and pushed back the fron-
tiers of darkness. In our own day each
in his leisure time can be expecied to
make some contribution to the scheme
of things. A hobby that teaches a skill,
an outdoor pursuit that keeps alive
some primitive capacity of understand-
ing, an interest that leads the individual
into paths of his own—they may well
profit a nation and keep its soul—yes,
and its body, too, alive. Let us not
forget that Great Britain, in its hour of
need, was saved at Dunkirk by the sea-
faring skills which an island population
had preserved, largely through sailing
and other sports. . . .

I have used the phrase “work in rec-
reation, and recreation in work.” In
this merging of the two concepts we
reach, it seems to me, the threshold of
a genuinely new and creative period.
Here is the opening of a way which, if

DECEMBER 1958

imaginatively pursued, can carry us i11-
deed into the city where we would be.
The work done in the midst of recrea-
tion already has been hinted at; let us
not ignore the recreation that comes in
the best and most fruitful of labor. We
have all known men and women who
found in their chosen tasks satisfaetions
such as the gayest and most proficient
of idlers could not match. . . .

With the dominance of the machine
the older joys of craftsmanship have
been lost irretrievably, to be recovered
only in hobbies and among a few artists
and worldly philosophers. What our
society is trying to do is to create dif-
ferent but equal pleasures through the
environment and atmosphere that sur-
round the job. The newer factory or
office, surrounded by open spaces, is
part of a wide effort to break down the
sharp barrier which once divided rec-
reation from work. . . .

The element of play, the sense of sym-
bol and spectacle, is returning to the
world of work; and these may yet trans-
form it—or at least restore to it some-
thing of the gaiety we associate with
preindustrial ages. The place of busi-
ness is no longer an entirely private
place. It is the rare and old-fashioned
industrialist who sleeps in a palace and
rules during the working hours over a
slum. Today’s manager wants his com-
pany to be known. He will build a
skyscraper, the most poetic and ro-
mantic of all of man’s structures; he
will raise banners and sound trumpets;
he will even invite the public to come
in and see how he and his associates
are doing. . . . All this may have a good-
ly element of salesmanship. But at the
heart of it there is a valid insight: the
awareness that work in itself is colorful
and exciting; that the labor of men and
machines together has the stuff of in-
finite drama; and that the good work-
man, like every good actor on the
world’s stage, performs better before an
audience.

Consider for a moment the shopping
center. Do we not have here all the
earmarks and appurtenances of an old-
fashioned fair? The family car is left
outside the gate. Inside shaded streets
and terraces tempt the wayfarer; he
rests beneath fountains and in the midst
of sculpture, while hanners, flowers,

signs, music, and, above all, dazzling
and seductively arranged merchandise
delight the senses. . . . Thus work and
pleasure merge under our gaze in a new
form. It is in developments such as
these, it is at those points where the
spirit of the recreationist touches and
illuminates the humdrum round of daily
existence, that the new quality of Amer-
ican life manifests itself. And when we
open our eyes to what is going on do
we not discern the answer to the dilem-
1na which I posed in my opening para-
graphs? If the words of my title . . . sug-
gest diverse interests, creative activities,
the liveliness of spirits constantly quest-
ing for deeper joys, then our age of
leisure can be a great age from every
point of view. It can be great in cul-
tural achievements, great in national
leadership, great in the inner rewards
which make of this earth a habitable and

delightful place.

I ask myself, in conclusion, whether
we are justified in being hopeful. I
think we must all have moods and mo-
ments when the direction in which we
are moving seems to be toward the mass
society, lulled and corrupted by mass
communications. Then recreation seems
to be identified with quiz shows; leisure
seems to be equated with nervous, agi-
tated, and unprofitable efforts to con-
form. The automohile and TV have
certainly not been used by our society
to the best of inherent possibilities.
Sports among us have too often neither
given a chance for participation to the
individual citizen nor given to the com-
munity a sense of genuine release and
celebration. We are all painfully aware
of how heedlessly our countryside has
been devoured and the gifts of nature
abused. Yet when all this has been said
something else remains; the conviction
that as a people we possess within our-
selves the capacity to do better than
we have done-

You, recreation leaders, justify that
conviction; you are the keepers of that
vision. In a very direct way you are
serving the nation. You are providing
one important answer to the great ques-
tion of our time——how we can combine
work and pleasure, how we can remain
true to ourselves and yet not fall behind

in the race to which, as Americans and
lovers of freedom, we are committed. #

A N T I F R E E Z E
for Your Winter Parties

{I‘- ’|r\

H ERE are two new ideas to use or adapt for those festive
cold weather parties. One requires a card or sheet
of paper made up in advance, to be given to each person.
The party planning committee can be responsible for pre-
paring them, or, in case of a large party, stencils may be
cut and the sheets mimeographed. In either case, they should
be a surprise to the guests.

Note that they are not “kid stuff.” They will work out
well with teen-agers, adults, and older adults, and they will
suggest many modifications or adaptations making them ap-
propriate for any special group or occasion.

Pick a Card

This card trick is easily one of the most baffling to the
victims. It does not require an accomplice, or a table, or
any skill in legerdemain, but no one seeing it is ever able
to discover 110w it’s done. NRA training specialist, Helen
Dauncey, learned it from a leader in an air force base and
passed it along to us. It’s too good to keep to ourselves, so
we’re passing it along.

The deck is “fixed” ahead of time but looks thoroughly

shuffled. The same “fix” will work over and over again. Do
try it! Follow these simple instructions:
To fix the deck: Separate into suits; put them into four
piles, starting on the left, in the order of spades, hearts,
clubs and diamonds. (Remember this order; it’s important
to the trick.) Each suit should have the ace on the bottom,
then the two, three, four, and so on, leaving the king on the
top of each pile.

Next, from the spade pile, put the ace, two, and three, in
that order, on top of the king. Take the heart pile, and put
the ace, two, three, four, five and six on top of the king.
From the club pile, put the ace, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight and nine on top of the king. From the diamond
pile, put the ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, jack, and queen on top of the king.

The card piles now look like this: Q 3, V 6, 4.9, Q 

Now make up your deck by picking up a card from each
pile, one at a time, from left to right. The deck is now ready
for the trick.

The Trick: Fan the cards out face down in your hands, ask
someone to draw a card, and you can tell him what it is. Put

342

the cards to the left of the one drawn on top of those in the
right hand. Notice the bottom card of the deck, noting it
quickly and unobtrusively as you close the deck. The card re-
moved is guessed by adding three to this card, and naming
the next suit, keeping the correct order of the suits in mind.
For example, if the bottom card is the four of spades, the card
taken out is the seven of hearts. If the bottom card is the
jack of clubs, the card taken out will be the ace of diamonds.
As the drawn card is replaced, put it on the top of the deck.

You can do this trick many times before the deck needs a
new “fix.” Try it. It’s the neatest trick of the year! It’s a
good stunt for practically every occasion.

Round the Clock

This idea came from Stewart G. Case, and was distributed
through Recreation Tips of Colorado A and M. The master
of ceremonies, or recreation leader, starts the game off by
calling a designated hour, such as “9 o’clock.” The crowd
then has one minute to find someone who fills the bill for
the item required. Time is then called, and the program re-
sumed. It is interrupted occasionally by calling other hours,
until the clock has been filled out.

The MC may then ask other questions, such as “Who has
the largest shoe?,” “Who is the tallest,” “Who has the red-
dest hair?” All these personal touches and “singling out” _
make for individual and group cnjoyment

ing session for recreation leadership at whatever level. . .

Meetings

Rousing speeches challenged this year’s Congress dele-
gates. Governor Meyner of New Jersey revealed a keen
understanding of recreation’s role in today’s living, and
put his finger on several of its problems. “Space will be a
critical prohlem in the coming years,” he said, as he urged
that as many areas as possible be acquired before price of
land becomes prohibitive. The situation is particularly
pressing in the metrOpolitan areas “where by 1975 two»
thirds of our total population will live. Parks and other
urban recreation areas have been invaded by city dwellers

to the saturation point and new places will have to be
found.”

“Out of the wisdom of the ages, we should be able to
forge a philosophy that will guide and inspire us in the
'lierreation Age,’ ” he went on. “We will never be guided

{11

 

or inspired by the idea of sheer idleness. We will always be
more attracted hy a concept which sees leisure as the

opportunity for mental, physical, and spiritual self-im-
provement; for the time to read great books; for the time
to pursue hobbies; for the time to study the stars in this
‘Space Age’; for the time to learn new skills and new meth-
ods of doing old things; for a time to permit the body to
develop and the spirit to expand. Out of such a philoso-
phy, great dreams can get dreamed and great things get
done by a happier people. That is my vision of the ‘Rec-
reation Age.’ ”

Leonard W. Mayo, executive director of the Association
for the Aid of Crippled Children, in speaking on “The
Dynamics and Philosophy of Recreation,” quoted Henry
Cabot’s book, What Men Live By, and referred to love,
work, play, and worship as the motivating forces in the life
of man. “Every profession in our country has an obliga-
tion in these critical days to determine what it can develop
that will add to the stature of all men and deepen our sense
of values.”

Mr. Mayo held that no other nation has to quite the
same degree the American’s regard for people and prac-
tical ways of helping them to help themselves. He pointed
out that our objective as recreation leaders should be “the
creation of a civilized human being; one who knows how
to develop his powers and preserve them, one who can gain
satisfactions from the exercise of his intellect as well as his
muscles and whose disciplined mind is tempered by a corn‘
passion and a regard for his fellows and for all men.”

Other speakers, some of whom are quoted further on,
elaborated on the emphasis of today’s recreation, the en-
richment of our growing leisure hours, the critical need
for more land and open spaces for recreation and relaxation
in an age of serious pressures, the need for trained leaders to
give recreation purpose and direction, physical and emo-
tional fitness for a strong America, and meeting the chal-
lenges of the future. Among them, Dr. Jay B. Nash, ex-
ecutive director of the New York State Association for
Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, and highly

respected “old pro” in the recreation field, emphasized rec-
reation as a basis for normality. “Delinquents are charac-

tcrized by lack of skill hobbies,” he stated. “If construc-
tive hobbies are not available, youth will seek others.”

New Trends in Playground Equipment

Not only were new forms of playground equipment dis-
played in the parking lot across the street from the Hotel
Ambassador, Congress headquarters, but their practical use
and value to physical fitness were demonstrated by the
youngsters who swarmed over them. Many of the older,
traditional forms of equipment have also been adapted to
present-day needs. Odd shapes and materials gave some a
slightly Martian look. Gleaming aluminum sheets that
turned out to be slides without stairs vied with turtles,
trampolines, unique merry-go-round contraptions, jet
planes, and, of all things, an old-fashioned stage coach, as
well as miniature railroad cars. Even an old-time swing
looked modern, when suspended from the mouth of a very
tall giraffe.

Most of the really new equipment took into account
childhood’s needs and interests, not only its impelling urge
for testing muscles, but its curiosity and need for learning
things. The Atlantic City exhibits, indoors as well as out,
enticed with gay colors, new textures, materials, and sur-
faces—concrete, Fiberglas, steel, plastics—all intriguing in-
' vitations to slide, ride, clinlb, jump, or “pretend.”

Specific Suggestions

The discussion sessions, rife with specific suggestions and
recommendations, were well attended.
0n Encroachment. To save existing park and recreation
lands across the country, remedies suggested were:
0 A charter provision declaring land for park and recrea-
tion inviolate. An exception to this is the power of the
state and federal government that can override a provision

of this sort.
0 Early consultation with highway planners and authori-

DECEMBER 1958

 

ties prior to establishment of final plans and specifications.
0 Establishment and acceptance of long-range plans for
park and recreation facilities. ,

0 Keeping citizenry well informed of the importance of
park and recreation facilities and urging them to speak
up if encroachment threatens.

o Encouraging formation of citizens groups into a private
park protective association.

0 Informing citizens of their right to initiate a taxpayer’s
suit in court to prohibit encroachment on park and recre-
ation land.

0n acquisition of additional land for future needs, on
the other hand, a lively discussion pointed out what recre-
ation and park executives can do. The following action was
urged:

o Estahlish a master plan, employing state, regional, or
national planners, the NBA, and expert consultants.

0 Consider making a regional plan for the hinterland
beyond corporate limits.

0 Consider the possibility of joining with the board of
education for school recreation plans.

0 Get the plan accepted by the planning and zoning au-

thority.
0 Set up legal machinery so all new subdivisions must be
reviewed and approved by the recreation authority.
0 Find “champions,” cultivate them, and let them do the
selling. Citizen interest is Vital.
0 Keep the dust off those plans, bare them to garden clubs,
civic clubs, special interest groups. The thirty-first annual
report of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning
Commission was cited as an excellent example. The fine
editorial, in the July, 1958 Parks and Recreation, “Park $
Are Cheaper Than House S,” was also cited as a helpful
tool.

0n recreation programs for women and girls, the ses-
sion opened with a statcment by Helen Dauncey, NRA
Katherine F. Barker Memorial Secretary on Recreation for
Women and Girls, that the demarcation line between hoys’
and girls’ activities is no longer clear-cut. She offered the

345

following specific suggestions regarding program areas:

‘0 Teaching skills, to increase participation in physical ac-
tivities. Leaders say girls won’t take part. The reason is
that we have not set up good teaching situations. Start at
the ages of six to twelve, and teach skills, not only in team
but in individual and dual sports.

-0 Develop programs stressing personal development, social
adequacy, and those activities that girls do because they
are girls, like homemaking, and skills to help girls under-
stand the role they will play as women.

0 Stress service projects, particularly those encouraging
development of leadership, such as working with special
groups of small children.

0n cooperation of schools and recreation departments the
following ways of promoting athletics and community ac-
tivities were suggested:

0 Agreements setting up a committee composed of two or
three members of each board.

0 Agreements between the superintendents of schools and
recreation to assure cooperation in the lower echelon of
operation.

0 Cooperation between principals and field supervisors, as
each must recognize the other’s position status.

0 Some communities have written agreements in the matter
of policies between boards; others, verbal agreements. In
either case, these must meet with approval of both parties.
0n creative programs for teen-agers, Grace Walker, NRA
drama specialist, again referred to Cabot’s What Men Live
By, quoting the ingredients of the good life and Dr. Cahot's
statement, “Leave out any one of these life experiences and
we are not quite whole people.” Miss Walker commented,
“It would seem that recreation in its great reach toward the
recreation of the human spirit must become aware of this
fact and must, by that count, develop the program which
will give play and interplay to these life forces.”

Miss Walker went on: “How else does the teen-ager
differ from the mature adult? One word will partly ex-
press this difference—experience. . . . Through experience
the mature adult has developed certain powers to cushion
his dissatisfactions and unachieved hopes. He has a philoso-
phy, strength of character, faith——-call it what you will—
that the average teen-age youth has not lived long enough
to possess. So this period is inclined to be more turbulent
and hafiiing than either the young child’s or adult’s.”

If we would serve our teen-age group with any adequacy

we must:

0 Take stock of our turbulent world, and help teen-agers

understand it.
o Realize that' often the teen-ager has failed to receive in

earlier years help and training to prepare himf or this period.
Therefore, we often need to go back in time, being careful
to use materials acceptable to his present development.

0 Not forget that youth is a part of a person’s develop-
ment—with a special contribution of energy, vitality, en-
thusiasm, and imagination.

0 Remember the process whereby human beings learn and
grow.

()n Youth Fitness. Immediate goals for action and long-

 
  
   
 
 
  
   
  
  

range plans for a community program of youth fitness migh
include:
o Obtaining local community action. It is the belief 0
parents, teachers, and all the members of the communit
that physical activity is a vital part of a person’s lif
pattern.
0 Health education, including nutrition, in addition t
physical education and recreation, should he strongly em
phasized, since health attitudes, health habits, and funda
mental skills for physical activity are developed in the early
years.
0 A greater use of existing public and private facilities,
and the provision of additional ones where necessary. Suc
facilities include schools, recreation centers, playgrounds,
parks, swimming areas, and so on.
0 Seek high-quality, trained leadership, with the active
support of parents and the entire community.
0 Increase the stature of physical education as an integral
part of the school curriculum, with a constant effort to
improve leadership, program, and facilities.
0 Provide recreation programs for after school and the!
summer season with qualified, trained leadership. Sccurel
and plan for adequate facilities, indoor and out. Encourage!
wider use of public schools as community centers.
0 Achieve immediate or long-range goals by stimulating
c00peration with all private and public agencies, so a pool-
ing of special skills and knowledge will result from working
together.
0 Make the importance of spiritual values in the total
development of youth a definite part of a complete pro-
gram. As members of our society, youth must be incul-
cated with the high ideals on which our democracy rests.
The President’s Council on Youth Fitness offers guides1
to any community, metropolitan or rural, but insists that
the local community is the keystone in the fitness program.
Then we can point with true pride to democracy in action.

Heard Here and There

“We. are prone to become rather complacent—especially]
if we feel that we have a good recreation program, and w
do have. It takes something like National Recreatio
Month to shake us out of our lethargy, and bring question
to mind: Do we really reach the number of children, teen
agers, and older citizens we should? Do we provide th
facilities needed to do the job properly, and, if not, ar
we doing all we can and must to provide necessary facili
ties? Is our program what it should be to hold the in
terest and instruct the children of this ‘Atomic Age’—th
age of sputniks, guided missiles, and space projection, o
are we inclined to just go along with the same old progral
as handed down from one generation to another?”-—-—H. SI
LEWIS, General Superintendent, Memphis Park Comrnis
sion, Memphis, Tennessee. ‘

“Accepting the fact that our workers have the essentia
training to understand their jobs, an agency must be eve
alert to orient him to an understanding of the goals ahead]
As a worker achieves his basic desire to grow profession
ally into a mature leader, it is our job to see to it then!
is always something he can ‘grow up to.’ With understand.

   
   
   
  
  
  

ng and growth on the job, plus faith in our profession and
in the future of our great land, the motivation of our new
vorkers becomes a symbol for us all.”———SARA M. MCCAUL-
LEY, Executive Director, Colony House, Brooklyn, New
York.

“During forty-six years in recreation and social work,
we have always been curious as to why, among a group of
people with identical education and experience back-
grounds, some stand out as great leaders, others merely as
great technicians. We have found that the distinction, the
added spark that makes some great, others not, is capacity
for love, for faith in, and selfless dedication to others, and
—good humor. These certainly reach their peak in ‘ET.’ ”
-———J. W. FAUST, speaking of E. T. Attwell, at the Attwell
Breakfast.

Hold Your Hats I

Dr. Marion Clawson, main speaker in a session on re-
sources for the future, predicted that by 2000 A.D. we may
expect twice as many people in this country as we have
now, twice as high per capita income, fifty per cent more
travel per capita, and fifty per cent more real leisure. We
may expect a corresponding increase in demand for out-
door recreation areas, in fact, ten times the present demand.

Potential demand for these areas by 2000 A.D., as com-
pared to actual use in 1956, was predicted to be four times
as great as at present for user-oriented areas, sixteen times
as great for intermediate areas, forty times as great for
resource-based areas (probably a fifty per cent increase).

The Road Ahead

Three nationally known recreation leaders addressed the
closing session of the Congress on the challenging subject
of “The Road Ahead”:

“The success of organized recreation depends more upon
its leaders than on any other factor. Quality leaders, trained
and experienced, form the very foundation of a program.

“The hope of the future lies in the ability of our pro-
fession to attract worthy boys and girls into its study. We
must definitely establish opportunities along this line and
let it be known that these opportunities exist and where.

“Our profession is up against high-powered competition
in all the other fields of career life and we will of necessity
have to do an exceptionally good ob to provide leadership
for the road ahead.

“The profession is awakening to this responsibility.”—
HAROLD D. MEYER, Chairman, Recreation Curriculum, Uni-

“The challenge of adequately serving America’s leisure
needs calls for not only the imagination and vision of every
private and government agency but a strong conviction on
the part of responsible citizens’ groups that this is one
of our greatest social problems. The whole leisure-time
program is so vital to the growth and welfare of our coun-
try that it is important to seCure the maximum possible
utilization of total community resources. It is highly de-
sirable that a balanced and harmonious procedure be de-
veloped through which coordination of the agencies con-
cerned will result in effective, efiicient, and economical
operation of all resources and, as a result, an enrichment of
human values.”——ROBERT CRAWFORD, Recreation Commis-

Some members driue as far as a hundred miles to take part in weekly rehearsals of the Aberdeen community orchestra.

How many citizens in. you? town, who

were music students during their school

days, have stored away their skills and talents?

NE NIGHT during the winter in

Java, South Dakota, August Sch-
lepp closed his drug store early and
headed home for a hasty dinner.
Though wind was sweeping snow across
the prairie as he finished his meal, he
climbed into his car, a black case in
hand, and hcadecl for Aberdeen. Vinety
minutes and seventy-five miles later he
pulled up in front of a building on the
Northern State Teachers College
campus and strode into it.

"Why this (lash across the plains?
The long nighttime journey, braving
the blizzard, suggests he was rushing a
much-needed drug to a patient. Such
was not the case. Schlepp’s seventy-
five-mile drive was to attend the weekly
rehearsal of the Aberdeen Civic Sym—
phony Orchestra. Inside his case were
not drugs but a favorite fiddle he uses
as first violinist in this orchestra of

amateur music-making. From all over
the northeast corner of South Dakota
come other devoted amateurs who love
to make music together. A high-school
music teacher and a high-school student
who plays the clarinet come from
Conde, forty miles distant. Thomas
McDermott,
ninety-mile round trip to rehearsals and

a merchant, makes a
concerts, while another violinist, W. E.
Schimke, drives as far as one hundred
miles to get there.

The orchestra that lures these Da-
kotans such distances was born a little
over three years ago. It came to life
through the efforts of Dr. John IV.
Shepard, music faculty member at
Northern State. “When I arrived here
in the fall of 1954, I found five fresh-
men college students enrolled for credit
in orchestra,” says Dr. Shepard. “But
I also soon discovered an untapped
pool of talent in townspeople hungry
for a chance to express themselves
through music. And Monday Musicale,

the local federated music club, wantcd
to sponsor a community orchestra.”

The newly arrived music teacher
served as catalyst between college and
community. He drew members from
among music students and citizens of
Aberdeen and other_ areas. Northern
State donated some instruments and a
rehearsal room. Two-hour sessions are
held each week, with college students
studying for credit, rehearsing an extra
hour.

The ease of starting the Aberdeen
Symphony and its success to date
demonstrate that nearly every medium-
sized community can have an orchestra.
More than eleven hundred symphony
orchestras composed of community
neighbors have sprung up over the
country. Many are based on the founs
dation of finding fun and family fel-
lowship through music.

Such is the case with the Aberdeen
Symphony, now directed by Daniel
Chazenoff. Take the Merritt Johnson

anrily as an example. A teacher of
)iano and organ at the college, J ohn-
on concentrates on the cello in the or-
hestra. His wife, Kathryn, plays the
'iola, and their daughter, Mitta, a high-
chool sophomore, is a first violinist.
or Mitta Johnson and cellist Julie
himmon, the symphony provides ex-
erience far more advanced than the
high-school orchestra.

Participants maintain there are many
personal rewards to be gained in the
Aberdeen orchestra. That’s why it at-
tracts people from grade-school stu-
dents to grandfathers. Many of the or-
chestral group feel they are furnishing
the community with high-level enter-
tainment in the concerts they present.
Some point to the cultural aspects of
presenting a great number of classical
works. People Whose vocations are
other than music find release from ten-
sion and great enjoyment in “playing
for fun.” Those who wish to become
proficient on a second instrument dis-
cover the opportunity to Work on it in

'l'he inspiring Nativity scene erected

the result of cooperative effort on the

superintendent of recreation, has been a
part of the local Christmas season for
ten years.

A large slice of Aberdeen civic pride
is vested in this musical organization.
Residents prefer seeing musicians and
friends perform in person at rehearsals
or concerts rather than listening to mu-

sic on the radio or recordings. These_

public performances also give orches-
tra members a goal to work for.

To encourage students of local music
teachers, the orchestra sponsors com-
petitions for soloists with the symphony.
Many students have competed to date,
with the result there is an increased in-
terest in music throughout the area.

A side light of the orchestra’s activ-
ity has been teaching younger members
how a musical organization is set up
and operated. The Aberdeen Symphony
drew up a constitution and bylaws to
insure perpetuation of the group, de-
spite personnel changes.

Program planning is one of the big-
gest problems as Dr. Shepard discov-
ered. The music must challenge the

to try to widen the eXperience of the
players by using less familiar music
rather than those numbers heard con-
stantly. Keeping its public in mind, the
orchestra must present music attractive
to the audience, to assure a constantly
growing attendance.

Severe winter storms do not cool the
enthusiasm of the musicians, but make
the crowds at concerts unpredictable.
Soloists are used to stimulate popular
interest. Many local piano teachers,
vocalists, and violin soloists have ap-
peared with the orchestra.

DECORATIONS 
WITH A THEME

UNIQUE and interesting Christmas decorations in the
central business district of Oakland, California, had an in-
ternational theme last year, with business and merchants
associations, stores, utilities, banks, oHice buildings, and
restaurants combining ideas to bring to Oakland citizens
decorations and interpretations of holiday customs in for-
eign lands. The cooperative holiday theme was planned
by a citizens committee, of which park superintendent
William Penn Mott, J r. was chairman.

“This was an exciting, colorful, dramatic experience for
holiday shoppers,” says Mr. Mott, “and unique. . . . Ideas
for bringing to life foreign customs had been gleaned from
consulates, world trade centers and the International Insti-
tute of Alameda County, and merchandise imported for the
Christmas season was featured in many of the stores.”

For example, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph C0111-
pany selected the Philippines as the country for its decora-

tions, including costumes and a Nativity scene, contrasting '

them with typical American decorations. The Pacific Gas
and Electric Company chose Switzerland. A store known
for its “world of gifts” had a world-wide motif on the first
floor and a single country featured in the Christmas trees
and decorative effects on each of the upper floors. At an-
other, shoppers saw Christmas trees trimmed to represent
distant lands in keeping with the slogan, “All the World
Says Christmas.”

Other specially decorated windows included a Nativity
setting and a Mexican-Spanish theme. One company put
on an international program in an “international room” on
one of the upper floors. J. C. Penney’s thirty-six windows
each displayed different countries, with Santa Claus hold-
ing packages symbolic of each. Flags of the foreign nations

and dolls in costume appealed to the youngsters shopping

with their parents.

Among other buildings in the town, banks, as well as
building-and-loan companies, cooperated with decorated
trees depicting Christmas around the world; flags of all
nations and Christmas garlands and wreaths were used in
others; poinsettias added color to many restaurants, which
matured exotic dishes during the holidays; and Christmas

‘{ hf.

lighting effects appeared in the central business area at
night.

Boxed cedar trees, with large red bows, decorated main
streets, and tinsel and bells were strung from the overhead
wires in the central area. One small trafiic island proudly
displayed a white Christmas tree with the latest in twinkling
lights, enhanced by banked red poinsettias underneath.

The famed Jack London oak in the center of the plaza
acted as the city Christmas tree and was decorated with red
lights similar to those used in New York’s Rockefeller
Plaza. The Hassler Memorial fountain’s colored lights and
changing patterns served as a background, and an eight-
foot mural wall on the San Pablo Avenue and 14th Street
sides, depicting scenes from Christmas around the world,
was enhanced by a large Madonna and two angels lighted
by hidden spotlights. “Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men”
in large cut-out letters was placed in front of them.

The Oakland Municipal Civil Service Chorus, under John
M. Falls, gave concerts in the plaza in front of City Hall, I
for the pleasure of noontime shoppers, and Christmas carols '
of other nations were included in the daily programs dur-
ing Christmas wcek, in addition to traditional music.

Oakland’s active Christmas program includes one of the
city’s most important events—its annual Holiday Decora-
tions Program, which was called “Green Boughs and Glit-
ter” this year. These decorating sessions, sponsored by the
park department and the garden clubs of the East Bay, in
cooperation with the Oakland Tribune, take place around
the first week in November and last four days. Open to the
public without admission fees, they attract approximately
fifty thousand people.

The sessions, broken up with organ recitals, start in the
morning and run through until afternoon two of the days
and run until nine at night the other two. They include in-
struction in gift wrapping, table and outdoor decorations,
using your garden 'for Christmas, and many others.

The citizens committee is making plans to carry out a
Christmas theme in the core area of Oakland in future
years. This was the first year that a coordinated effort was

attempted—Oakland Park Department, Oakland.

I 0E WENT bounding around the chairs in back of the
J bowling alley yelling, “What color are you? I need red.
Who has red?” No, he wasn’t hunting for an American
Indian, but searching for a team member to complete his

. team roster.

The color classification system has been used, with con-
|siderable success, in ,grouping heterogeneous skill levels
land permitting individual choice as to teammates at the
same time. The system presupposes some tentative prior
classification has been made either by the leader, advisor,
or club manager. Bowling is used as an illustration, al-
though this system is successful in other sports. The color
card system operates as follows:

0 Each bowler receives a card with his or her name, aver-

age, and a color on it on team organization day.

0 These colors are set up by the club president and the

advisor, in advance, on the basis of the range of averages

of the bowling group.

0 The range is divided into four approximately equal
. classes and each bowler is put into the respective grouping

in which his average falls, with the highest at the top and

the lowest at the bottom.

0 On team organization day, each bowler is given his card,

and he or she may join any team as long as each member

has a different colored card. Since this is a coed group,

there is at least one woman member per team.

It is important, as a club advisor, to encourage all inter-
ested bowlers to come out for preliminary practice so that
you and the group leader can work together in setting
limits for the various skill levels. In bowling, the establish-
ment of an averagc works as an effective skill classifier. In
basketball, archery, and so on, it would be necessary to
develop other criteria, although simple skill tests or in-
formal subjective ratings could be used.

In dividing the group, the number of colors to be used

. depends on the number desired on each team and the num-
ber out for the activity. This system is not necessary for a

small group, but when fifty-seven bowlers of varying de--
grees of skill are all trying to get on the same team, trouble‘
results. At the same time, if the advisor or group leader‘
makes up the teams in advance, the present friendships andI
boy-girl relationships are often unknown and therefore not
taken into account.

On team organization day, it is imperative that all pro-
spective participants be present. Out of sight is often out of
mind, and the absent player is usually overlooked.

The advisor must set the stage, as it were, for the degree
of permissiveness and frame of reference used in teammate
selection. It is necessary that the quiet little ones, the more
poorly skilled, the less physically attractive, the “leftovers”
not all be dumped in one team. If they are holding that red
color, they are the very ones needed to make the fourth in
the group and should be sought after by the others. It is
also necessary for the advisor to announce that each person
must make an effort to find three other colors.

In order that all may have the Opportunity to form teams
at the same time, the color divisions are not given out
ahead of time: On the signal, fourteen red, fourteen blue,
fourteen yellow, fourteen green are all milling around
trying to locate the other three with whom they wish to play.
For a while, confusion seems to reign but soon groups of
fours are formed.

The best way to reduce the formation of half of a team is
to ask each group of four to sign up with the advisor. Upon
signing in the team is recognized and assigned an alley.

The advantages of this classification system are in that
it gives a variety of choices for team members. You are
thus fairly certain of getting a friend on your team and
also fairly certain of getting a stranger. It also minimizes
clique formation and exclusion. The teams formed feel that
this is what they really wanted, and not that this team was
set up by the manager-advisor, who was biased in favor of
some other group. At the same time, it equalizes varying
levels of skill. It is found that the more highly skilled at-
tempt to help the lesser skilled in order to bring the team
along. The teams hold together longer because they are
self-chosen and the resulting competition is fun for all. #

Freeways Can Be Beautiful

Landscape architects took action at
the recent convention of the California
Council of Landscape Architects, urg-
ing that plans for California’s new 12,-
500-mile freeway system preserve the
natural beauty of the surrounding coun-
tryside for conservation and scenic rea-
sons. They also resolved to support the
California Roadside Council
“Beautiful Highways” program, which

includes landscaping freeways, control
of billboards on the new interstate high-
way system, and a state-wide antilitter
campaign. Of course, control in the
initial planning stages is the only way
to effectuate these measures, and Cali-
fornia is to be congratulated for these
forward steps.

New N RA Studies

In response to requests for informa-
tion regarding the amount of money in-
vested in certain types of major recrea-
tion facilities, the revenue so derived,
and their total annual Operation cost,
the National Recreation Association
has conducted a study covering tennis
courts, golf courses, bathing beaches,l
and boating facilities. One of the
study’s objectives was determining the
comparative _cost of providing a unit of.
service at each facility.

Another study under way is on pub-
lic boating facilities, about which there
is a great lack of information. The de
tailed study will embrace such featurcs
as the boating facilities themselves
plan of operation, revenues, capital,
and current costs. When the studie
are completed, the findings will b
made generally available.

described as “a fast three months’ trip
to fourteen countries in Eur0pe . . .
and a hectic month visiting twelve cities
in Spain.” It would seem that the many,
many years Mr. Rogers spent traveling
over the United States, covering prac-
tically every district of the NRA, would
have dampened his ardor for suitcases
and hotel rooms, hut, no, this was his
sixth trip abroad, taking the polar route
from his home in San Francisco. He

particularly mentioned being impressed
by the World’s Fair in Brussels.

New Parklantls

. . . a public park, for no other use
whatever.” Thus reads part of financier
Frederick Foster Brewster’s will, leav-
ing Edgerton, his twenty-five-acre

during her life; at her death the estate,
with house razed, is to go to the city.

Reclamation. Two bond issues, total-
ing $570,000, were approved during
October, to construct a new park on
fifteen acres of reclaimed land in Frank-
lin Square, Long Island, New York.
Scheduled to open next spring, the
park will include three swimming pools,
athletic fields, and parking space for
265 cars. There are two interesting
factors about this park:

Earlier in October, 1,450 home own-
ers had written the Hempstead Town
Board urging that the Franklin Square
Park District be extended one mile
southward, to include the new site. As
as a result, that district now covers the
same area as the Franklin Square
School District.

Instead of raising taxes to cover pool
construction, costs will be financed by
annual fees of thirty-five dollars for
each participating family and fifteen
for individuals.

County park. Morris County, New
Jersey, dedicated and opened its first
county park on September 20. The
Lewis Morris Park is 350 acres of vir-
gin land, containing a pond for boat-
ing in summer and ice skating in win-
ter, forty-five fireplaces, picnic sites,
and parking for about eighty cars, at the
present time. The park, developed at a
cost of approximately $130,000, will be
left in its natural form, for the most
part, taking advantage of its beauty.

concerning their conceptions of them-
selves and others; their evaluation of
family, school, and community life;
and their employment records.

It will be inferesting to see how much
recreation fits into the total picture of
these various studies.

YOUR PROGRA

When it comes to the young married set, do your recrea—
tion programs miss the boat? Too many recreation people
seem to forget programs for this classification altogether.
Most young couples are wide open for the type of recrea-
tion we can give them. There are many activities around
which to build a program, ranging from special interests
to a general social program. A few examples that have
proven themselves are:

0 Social gathering, with a program and refreshment com-
mittee, loosely organized, with emphasis on getting together,
meeting people, and enjoying the persons you are with.

0 Discussion group with a potluck dinner, speaker, dis-
cussion, and good time.

o A gourmet group, with experts invited to discuss good
foods.

0 Bridge clubs—very popular.

0 Dance and social club. Schedule dances throughout the
year at one or more locations, add spice by having a theme
dance now and then, such as “South Seas,” “Hobo,” and
so on.

o A club that has a “home base” but goes afield for pic-
nics, swim parties, and what-have-you.

As you are, in reality, trying to meet the needs of people,
they themselves should decide whether to meet seasonally or
year round. Remember, it is a harder job to get a group
together after they disband for a while than it is to keep
them together in a long run. If they enjoy the activity, they
want to stay together year round.

Any agency can get into the act on this program. Smaller
agencies have, in fact, an advantage over larger, more im-
personal departments. Churches, Y’s, and similar agencies
have a distinct responsibility here; recreation departments
should in all cases explore the possibility. The larger the
agency, the harder the effort and the more careful the plan-
ning should be to get the program off to a good start.

If young couples belong to a church, large club, or some
siniilar group that announces that a “Young Married” club
will form many will come because they feel a part of it
already. They must feel they are a part of it or it must have

some special attraction for them. It is up to you to provide
that feeling. Just a general announcement to the public by
a recreation department that such a group will form will
meet with disaster, most of the time.

Plan carefully, get a nucleus, see what the need is, use
the personal approach, careful publicity, and so on. After
they come and enjoy the group, they will be your best sales-
men. Remember, these young couples are looking for things
to do together. It is better than having the husband go to
his bowling league and the wife to her bridge club.

Departments have a responsibility to furnish facilities
and such leadership as needed. These groups should, as
much as possible, run themselves. Naturally they should
expect to live up to policies of the sponsoring department.
Many times groups like this will aid your program with
funds and services. As much as possible they should pay
their own way. Meeting places should be furnished but not
food and special expenses. They will expect to carry their
own load. Someone from the recreation department should
be tied in with the group for guidance and good operational
reasons. Do not start such a group only to cut them loose
and still expect them to be a department club.

Most young couples like to be with other young couples,
but where does “young” stop? This, of course, is up to the
club founders. Some clubs have stipulations whereby, when
the combined ages of the couple reach a certain total, they
must drop their membership. Some examples are seventy-
seven, eighty, and one club is the “Century Club,” with a
limit of one hundred years in combined ages. Be sure to
make membership requirements known early so you are not
confronted with the problem of, “What do we do now?
The J oneses are nice people but they are over age!”

Young married clubs should not be rigid and formal, but
informal and fun. Your best selling point will be that young
couples can get together with other young couples and
enjoy their relationship. The program is entirely up to the
club. Naturally the committee or organizer will be required
to set up some sort of a program for the first time or two
until the full wishes of the group are learned. A series of
program and refreshment committees should be established,
one committee for each meeting. It is good to get everyone
active. Be sure to make your assignments by couples. You
might have a constitution, you might have ofiicers, you

DECEMBER 1958

might have business meetings; but, again, remember that
most young couples are interested primarily in the social
’aspects. If you use the committee idea, whereby a commit-
tee organizes the program and furnishes refreshments for
a meeting in its turn, you need not have a club treasury.
By this method you also insure. the club’s paying its way.

After the club is organized, a few problems always arise.
The following are a few of the more common ones you
might encounter: i
0 At a general meeting a couple or two that you would nor-
mally consider on the older sideshow up. Be sure your age
limits are established or you may end up with a presenior
citizens club. {-

0 You will meet the “professional club member,” who
wants to be in on everything, -have the last word, and his
own way. After the club gets started, he might drop it and
move on with the attitude of, “I got it started.” Good
guidance and diplomacy are required here.

0 You have to contend with the member who somehow gets
on a program committee, arranges (on her own) for a dry
film speaker, for instance, and declares, “This is the type
we should have. I can get forty to fifty films.” Programs
should be checked in advance,_1if possible, or the recreation
person cduld be a permanent member of the program
committee. 

0 After a couple have reached the maximum age limit no
one seems to have the heart to remind them of it and they
do not seem conscious of it. Adequate preparation should
be made as the “last year” segment of the club.

0 Antidepartment actions, such as smoking in a no-smok-
ing area, are a nuisance. This should be explained in
advance and if it crops up, the ‘rules enforced politely.

o The person who wants to turn the club to another use
and suggests, “We should be doing something for the good
of the community. Let’s make a service club.” Your club
is either sick; you need another club to meet the suggested
need; or the member should join another club. You had a
purpose when you formed, stick to it.

Organize your club the way it will be best for your
city; organize it to do the most good and meet the greatest
need. This is a program that also can prove very satisfying
to the professional recreation§leader. Don’t miss the boat
with the young married set. #-

Twelfth Night Revel

In Bronxville, New York

Have you ever been driving through your town or city
about one week after Christmas and seen the cherished
Christmas tree sticking out of some ash can or lying
neglected in the gutter? Isn’t this a sad fate for one of our
priceless Christmas traditions?

Bronxville, New York, a little village in suburbia just
fifteen miles out of New York City, lies within the town of
Eastchester, and the Eastchester Recreation Commission
provides Bronxville’s recreation program. The recreation
commission is augmented, in Bronxville, by two advisory
councils, the Bronxville Recreation Commission and the
Bronxville PTA Recreation Committee.

Mrs. R. Sherrard Elliott, of Bronxville, had for years

made a valiant plea to her community to do something to
preserve the rich tradition of the beloved Christmas tree
after it had served its purpose. Her plea was, “To me the
Christmas Eve program introduces a work of art; all works
of art should go full circle. 1 think supplementary pageantry
on Twelfth Night will round this circle.” The Bronxville
PTA Recreation Committee accepted the challenge.

The committee appointed Mrs. Janet Studebaker to pilot
the project. They certainly selected a dynamic, imagina-
tive, andnhard-working person in this young mother. She
simply went out and secured the services of just about
everybody in the village from the superintendent of schools
to the fire chief. Her organization was so good that, when
the curtain went up, everything went off on cue.

For three weeks prior to the much heralded Twelfth
Night, the front page of the local paper carried some news
about the affair. SUggestions were made that groups gather
in their neighborhoods and march with their Christmas
trees to the Bronxville high-school field, scene of the burn-
ing of the Christmas Trees, which was the purpose of
Twelfth Night. It was also suggested that odd dress, cos-
turning, and weird and eerie displays would be appropri-
ate for the occasion. Each week the names of different
people and organizations oining Twelfth Night were pub-
lished in the newspaper. It was announced that:

0 The fire chief and his corps of men would stand by with
an emergency truck should they be needed.

0 The superintendent of schools with his custodial staff
and a crew of senior high-school students would help.

0 A local radio and television store would supply music
and amplification for the program.

0 A local resident—a professional TV and radio an-

358

nouncer———had volunteered his services as program narrator.

0 Three staff members of the Bronxville school system
would lead community singing and provide instrumental
selections.

o The head of the school dramatic department had pre-
pared, with the help of the high-school drama group, a
clever skit which included Santa Claus, the jester, and other
imaginary characters.

0 The superintendent of recreation had organized the
Bronxville high-school football team, shrouded in their
football hoods, to act as guardians of the fire.

0 The PTA president would be master of ceremonies.

The Bronxville board of education cooperated with the
project and allowed the use of their athletic field for the
gigantic Christmas tree blaze. As churches, service and
social clubs offered their support they were listed in the
newspaper.

0n the twelfth night after Christmas, dusk was settling
over the Bronxville high-school athletic field when the
sound of a trumpet was heard, summoning all the people
to gather around a stockpile of Christmas trees, piled high
and roped off for schrity. All day people had been bring-
ing their Christmas trees to the area.

As the sound of the trumpet faded away, the narrator’s
voice was heard, directing attention to the highways and
byways approaching the field. Entire families were coming
from all directions with their Christmas trees. Down one
street came .a long procession of families, many in costume.
This group was led by the Pied Piper, playing a flute.

Then, resoundingly sharp and clear, the brass was heard,
announcing to the spirits that this was the time for revel
and merrymaking, ballading and caroling, masque and
music, fire lighting, and fun.

Out of the dusk and into the circle came a creature from
Mars to bring a message from outer space to the Twelfth
Night celebrants. At the same time Santa Claus came down
the field to receive the good wishes of everybody as he
prepared to return to the North Pole. Then the jester
danced and pranced around the circle. He clowned and
the children squealed their delight. With pomp and cere-
mony the jester escorted Mrs. Elliott, originator of this local ’
“Twelfth Night,” to the Christmas-tree pyre. With a
courtly bow to her he turned and tossed a lighted torch
into the trees, and a great streak of cleansing fire shot
toward the sky.

The jester danced around the fire and the people cried
out in excitement. Outside the roped area were huge stock-

ayers rushed to heap trees into the blazing inferno.

The merrymaking went on for an hour and a half and
'd not end until the last tree was burned. Then, in the

Misrule acts as narrator. He should be costumed as richly
as possiblc, wear a crown or a fool’s cap hung with bells and
carry a sceptre ornamented with gay ribbons with bells tied
to their ends. He shakes his sceptre to gain the attention of

of a scroll. At the end of his narration, he is handed a large,
lighted torch.

The five girls who bring in the various Christmas sym-
bols to be burned should also be in bright costumes and
should enter with great dignity. At the end of the narra-
tion, the five girls, escorted by a uniformed fireman, light
their torches from the narrator’s and proceed to the five
points of the star. All five points should be lighted simul-
taneously.

The Christmas trees are arranged ahead of time. They
should be upright, leaning toward the center, and spread
out into five points like a star, center height about fifteen
feet, total diameter about a hundred and twenty feet. Leave

plenty of air space to provide a good draft for the fire.

The program opens with singing of two Christmas carols
b} a high-school choral group; after which the Lord of
Misrule enters and reads the following:

1, Lord of Misrule, ruler of the yuletide season, proclaim
the following: Members of my court, according to tradi-
tion, Christmas ends tonight, the twelfth night. Originally
this night was set aside commemorating the visit of the
Magi or Wise Men, who, according to one interpretation,
reached Bethlehem twelve days after they had secn the
Christmas star on the night our Lord was born. According
to tradition, when the Magi returned to their kingdoms,
they gave up their high positions, distributed their property
to the poor, and went to preach the gospel of the Prince
of Peace.

Now these, and other early Christian missionaries, found
the pagan people celebrating with joyful, yet solemn fes-
tivities, the festival of the new year, when the long nights
and the gray shadows of the winter months were again
being replaced by sunlight and lengthening days. Since
these pagan rites took place during what is now known as
our Christmas season, the early Christians very wisely did
not try to destroy this pagan festival, but sought to com-
bine it with the Nativity celebration. Thus we have today
the feasting, the color, the evergreen, the holly, the mistle-
toe, the light, and many of the picturesque customs and
much else belonging to the old pagan festivals as part of
our Christmas program.

As you know, all Christmas symbols should be removed
and put away on the twelfth night. You are gathered here
to assist in this rite.

Decorating for Christmas is a custom of heathen origin—
an offering of winter hospitality to the spirits and fairies
who haunted the leafless woods. The yuletide habit of
using greenery by the Christians is to emphasize the Na-
tivity idea. One authority states that trimming the homes
and churches with evergreens reminded man of Christ’s
Godliness and that the Child born at Bethlehem was both
God and man, “who would spring up like a tender plant,
should always be green and flourishing and live forever
more.” Today this custom is still with us! (The first girl
now walks up and places a Christmas wreath upon the
symbolic bonfire.)

The holly, with its sharp prickles and blood-red berry,
was, and still is, considered the symbol of joy and peacc.
Early beliefs gave the holly mysterious powers. It could
bring good luck, it could ward off witches, and protect oc-
cupants from severe weather, thunder, and lightning. Poets
of days gone by have often praised the holly. May the
holly always bear its green leaves and red berries at Christ-
mas time! (Second girl now places holly on bonfire.)

The use of the mistletoe at Christmas time dates back to
the old pagan customs, for mistletoe holds for them all sorts
of miraculous virtues. One legend comes from Scandana-
vian folklore, which deemed it so sacred that if enemies
met casually beneath the mistletoe in the forest, they laid
down their arms and maintained a truce until the following
day. Then grew the practice of hanging mistletoe in door-

360

ways, the passing under which was understood to impl
pledge of peace and friendship and was sealed by a frien
greeting or kiss. May the mistletoe always represent frie
ship and affection! (Third girl places mistletoe on fire.)

The use of lighted candles, now universally used as
yuletide decoration, dates back to the time hefore Ch
when the pagans fastened them to trees to dcnote the su
return to thc carth. The Christian use of the candle, s
bolic of Christ as the light of the world, is said to be a co
bination of Roman and Hebrew customs. Bayberry c
dles, with their delicate odor, are popular at Christmas a
are said to bring good luck to a home. Also there is
belief that if sweethearts who are separatcd at Christin
light bayberry candles the scent will be wafted from one
the other—even across the world if they are truly in lo
May candles always burn at Christmas. (Fourth girl pla
candles in fire.)

It would be an oversight if nothing were said of the po
lar custom of exchanging cards. The first Christmas car
appeared about one hundred years ago in England, b
not until 1900 did we find it in this country. Today, th
are almost a must; of odd design and messages there is
end. May kindly messages always unite friends at Chris]
mas time! (Fifth girl places Christmas cards on fire.)

 

There is a difference between a hymn and carol. A hy
is essentially devotional, while a carol is a song in whi
a religious theme is treated in a familiar, playful, or festi
style. It is a curious fact that Christmas is the only festiv
for which carols have been written and kept in use. (Sin
Christmas carol at this point; just a short one.) Never 1
us forget the singing of Christmas carols! (Narrator plac
copy of Christmas carol on fire.)

The use of the evergreen, a symbol of immortality, dat
back to the early primitive tribes who revered nature. To-
day, in the United States, about two-thirds of the homes
center their holiday gaiety around a lighted Christm
tree. This tree, with which we are most familiar, is credite
to Martin Luther. Since his time it has become an estab-
lished' custom for the tree to take a large place in the
Christmas celehration. May the forests ever contribute
fragrance and beauty to this festive season! (Narratm
places small Christmas tree on fire.)

Among all these many customs there is one which is pre
eminently symbolic. It is the burning of the Christmas
greens. The season is at end; the Christmas greens are dr}
and sear, but as the fire consumes them, they give light and
cheer. The spirit of the Christ Child is always with us
May His light and warmth make the whole world one. 1
command you, bearers of the yuletide season, light you]
torches and fire the star which is the symbol of lightI
warmth, and cheer in our hearts! (At this point the fivi
girls light their torches and, escorted by a uniformed fire-
man, proceed to the five points of the star. Meanwhile, th!
choral group sings “We Three Kings of Orient Are,” ané
at the conclusion of this song the girls apply their torches
to the five tips of the star. This brings to a close our “burn-
ing-of—the~green” program.—City of Pontiac, Michigan,

MACINATION is the beginning of crea—

most wants. A five-year-old, for ex-
ample, may want desperately to be in
school because his older brothers are
there, but he must remain at home a
while longer. Out of his small knowl-
edge of school he imagines he is in
school. He “plays out” his desire and
for the while he is lost in his play, is
satisfied and happy. The observer is
entranced with the play. He is privi-

satisfy a need. The act is an end in
itself, but more important a means of

IMAGINATION

Is the

BEGINNING

means to growth. We know that cer-
tain wines need to be uncorked to
breathe. We know that life depends on
inhalation and exhalation. Just so, self-
expression is a two-way process. Some-
thing must be taken in before expres-
sion can occur, and teachers and parents
need to learn the difference between re-
gurgitation and creative expression.
Too often they are satisfied with the
first. They encourage repetition in toto.
To be able to recognize and encourage
what is truly creative is the skill of the
fine teacher. To develop this skill, the
teacher or leader attempts and observes

the creative process in himself as well

as in children. He discovers it is his
imagination, which is the yeast that
leavens the product and makes it unique
and individual. He begins to be aware
of the difference between creative activ-
ity and directed activity. He learns in
teaching to so structure the lessons that
a wide variety of responses is possible
and acceptable. The kind of lessons
where only one response is acceptable
is limiting and discouraging. This is
the difference between lessons in art
and creative art activity.

Kissing Ball!

C HRISTMAS has many intriguing holi-

day aspects other than its morc
solemn significance as a religious ob-
servance. The very air crackles with
festive feelings; pe0ple greet each other
with warmth at Christmas time; and the
pungent smell of evergreen permeates
everything.

One friendly custom, more or less rel-
egated to the attic since Prince Albert
introduced the Christmas tree into Vic-
torian England, is the kissing ball—-a
delightful combination of mistletoe,
greenery, and traditional Christmas or-
naments. At one time, this decoration
hung in a prominent place in every
English home from Christmas Eve until

Twelfth Night. The English made the

version of the kissing ball. You can
make your foundation of Styrofoam;
cut sprigs of greenery—balsam, pine,
fir, juniper, hemlock, or spruce—into
even lengths of about five or six inches;
then poke them into the Styrofoam so
nothing but the green shows. Tips of
boxwood, red -berried, small -leaved
holly, or even small pine cones can be
added to vary the effect. Punch small
branches of mistletoe tied together with
bright holiday ribbon into the bottom.
To hang it, poke a wooden pick, with a
wire loop, into the top. The variations
are as unlimited as your imagination.

Making a kissing ball would be a
wonderful recreation center project for
the holiday season, as well as for your
own home. Hung near the front door
or over a dining table, the kissing ball
imparts a traditionally festive air to the
holiday season. Let’s revive this warm

N UNUSUAL stage music shell build-
A ing was completed recently in the
existing amphitheater in City Park,
Montebello, California. The amphi-
theater itself provides seating in a nat-
ural outdoor setting for approximately
seventeen hundred persons. The shell
building is of a design and concept new
in outdoor cultural facilities. I did the
original design with multiuse in mind;
refinements and working drawings by
George F. Schreiber, an outstanding
southern California architect.

The structure itself is built on a
modified X: the front and larger por-
tion of the X is the stage area of some
nine hundred square feet, approachable
by doors from the rear side of this area
and by inclined ramps in front of the
proscenium arch. The enclosed back
portion of this modified X provides
dressing rooms, separated by a folding
partition. These may be opened into
one large room, accommodating rehear-
sals for dramatic and musical groups,
as well as craft classes and other indoor
activities. Extending completely across
the back of the structure is a large

storage room, especially designed for
full-sized scenery Hats and other stage
equipment. Another unusual feature of
the stage area itself is a wooden grid
set into the stage slab. This grid runs
diagonally, four feet on centers, per-
mitting use of stage screws and braces
to erect scenery for dramatic produc-
tions. Without this grid, it would be
very diHicult to set scenery properly on
a concrete slab. The structure will be
equipped with the very latest in sound
amplification and portable stage light-
ing. The stage itself will seat approxi-
mately one hundred musicians and is of
adequate size to present dramatic pro-
ductions of almost any scope. The title
of the structure is the Community
Stage-Music Shell, and it was erected at
a cost of less than $20,000. Part of this
was contributed from funds raised by
the Montebello Fun Festival, an annual
community celebration.

If anyone has further questions,
please feel free to write this department.
Like most recreation professionals, I
have a strong conviction that cultural
activities could well be the solid core
around which community pride might

flourish. #

I N VIEW of the rapidly increasing num-

ber of artificial ice skating rinks
being installed, what is the outlook for
ice skating on the lakes, ponds, rivers,
and sloughs located in park and recrea-
tion areas? Experience at Lake Ellyn,
a six-acre expanse in Glen Ellyn Park
District, Illinois, would indicate that
demand for large outdoor skating areas
continues to increase. Weather permit-
ting, ice skating facilities at Lake Ellyn
draw an ever-increasing number from
an expanding area, which at times taxes
our facilities. It would appear that the
artificial rinks, which can be made
available before lake skating, have been
contributing substantially to the in-
creased interest in ice skating generally.
However, the increasing interest in out-
door winter sports including skating, in
recent years, can be attributed in great
part to the development of wearing ap-
parel which is light, comfortable, per-
mits freedom of movement, yet at the
same time keeps the individual com-
fortably warm.

In Glen Ellyn, we have been attempt-
ing to expand the available skating area
and to have the facilities open for use
during a maximum period during the
winter season. This we are finding a
challenge; but, with adequate prepara-
tion and proper facilities, it should be

possible to anticipate a month to six
Weeks season of outdoor ice skating.

Weather—Important Factor

In the Chicago area, weather is the
most important element, and, therefore,
in operating during the past three or
four years, we have worked closely with
the Chicago weather bureau, whose
forecasters have been most helpful.

In order to maintain a fairly large
ice skating area we have found that it
is necessary to take advantage of every
break in the weather, both the imme-
diate and also the forecast. It is well
known, and we accept the forecasts from
the weather bureau office on that basis,
that weather conditions change rapidly
and the forecast may not develop; but,
from experience, the percentage of ac-
curate forecasts is high and worthwhile
in setting up a program.

This is being written in February,
during the coldest period experienced
so far, with reading of ten to twelve
degrees below respectively during the
last two nights, with clear skies. We
now have around fifteen inches of ice
on the lake and therefore, for the rest
of the season, will have a foundation
which will permit use of heavy equip-
ment. How we got that sheet of ice, and
the problems involved, may be helpful
to others.

Flooding Also Important

We had no skating available in De-
cember. A reference to the “Local Cli-

matological Data” for December, 1957,
a weather-bureau summary of temper-
atures, precipitation, and other data
issued monthly (annual subscription,
$1.50) shows that on December 10, a
low of eight degrees was reached, fol-
lowed by a two-degree low on December
11 and three degrees on the 12th; how-
ever, since our lake ranges in depth
from a few inches to over six feet it
did not freeze over in full. During the
rest of December, temperatures ranged
from a high of forty to fifty-two de-
grees, and from a low of thirty-seven to
twenty degrees. By the morning of De-
cember 30 we had about one inch of
ice covering the lake and in the follow-
ing twenty-four hours about a six-inch
snowfall. With ice too weak to support
equipment and with an insulating blan-
ket of snow, ice formation, even in the
presence of low temperatures, is very
slow. To offset this we started flooding
the surface with two portable gasoline .
pumps operating from tllc pier extend-
ing about sixty feet into the lake. By
night, with a forecast of much colder
weather for at least a week, we had sunk
the snow for a distance of about one
hundred feet from the pier, which set
up and froze during that night when the
temperature dr0pped to a low of twenty
degrees. 0n Nest Year’s Day, we moved
out onto the ice and continued to flood,
also using a pair of skis. We had a

Host to Championship Raccs

For the last twenty years, Lake Ellyn
has been host to the Illinois State Out-
door Ice Speed Skating Championship
Races, run under the auspices of the
Glen Ellyn Amateur Athletic Associa-
tion, under the sanction of the Amateur
Skating Association of Illinois. During
the week the worried members of the
association’s skating committee assisted
in the night flooding. Their meet was
scheduled for Sunday, January 5, and
on Friday night the volunteer crew
sprayed the area to be used for the
track and the meet came off on schedule.

Use of Snow Blowers and Sprayers

On January 15, some light snow fell
.and continued each day thereafter. On
January 19 through the 215t we had an
'almost continuous, very heavy, wet
snowfall. On Monday, January 20, we
Ikept our jeep with a scoop operating
on an area covering about half the lake.
At 11 A.M. it became necessary to halt
operations to give the crew and volun-
teer workers a rest; however, up to that
time, we had the situation under con-
trol. With a forecast of much more wet
snow on the following day we would
havc operated the jeep all night, if we
could have. However, that was impos-
sible and. as a result, on Tuesday, we
could no longer move the wet snow and
had to shut down. Therefore our ice
skating facilities were closed down until
Monday, February 3, a matter of two

equipment and sufficient labor. How-
ever, on Saturday and Sunday, January
25 and 26, we flooded the partially
cleared area and saturated the snow,
now about five inches deep, even though
forecasts did not indicate much colder
weather, but did predict light snow for
scveral days more. In fact, it continued
to snow through the rest of January

DECEMBER 1958

and accumulated another four inches
on top of the surface of frozen slush ice.
With colder weather and low temper-

atures beginning Friday, January 31,.

the slush ice tightened and, with from
five to nine inches thickness of ice, we
began clearing the snow with two snow
blowers; however, where the snow was
deep and packed we had some trouble
and had to resort to shovels because of
failure of the slush ice to freeze. By
Sunday, February 2, we were able to
get the heavy equipment on the ice, in-
cluding the shaver, and, by Wednesday,
February 5, we had the area cleared and
under control. On that evening we
sprayed the most heavily used ice-skat-
ing area, against a forecast of colder
weather, which did not dcvelop. We
used well water rather than lake water
since the warmer well water, about fifty-
five degrees, would melt some of the
finer shavings and “snow” created by
the skaters and produce a better surface
when sprayed on snow ice. The follow-
ing day the weather turned colder and

the flooded area tightened.

Basie Weather Facts

Each year is different. However, after
a number of years of observation, there
are some basic facts with respect to the
weather in this area, which form a
pattern. While cold fronts do not move
in on exact dates, some time after De-
cember 20 one moves in and usually the
first week in January will bring suffi-
ciently low temperatures to build ice.
Also, the first week in February is
usually quite cold. From the standpoint
of participation, the Christmas holidays
are best and heavy attendance continues
through the first week in February.

While flooding to eliminate snow
causes formation of so-called “snow
ice” and results in rough ice, porous
and full of minute air bubbles, it is
possible by flooding or spraying to
build up a fairly hard surface and then
by shaving to create a smooth skating
surface.

Snow on top of ice is difficult to
handle unless the ice sheet is at least
six inches thick, and even this thickness

' can be treacherous on warmer days if

snow is heavy. With ice thickness under
five inches and any substantial snow,
three or four inches, flooding is usually
preferable. Bearing in mind that ice is

one-eighth of an inch buoyant for each
inch of ice, saturation of snow on the
surface soon weighs the ice sheet down
below the buoyancy point. If holes are
chopped in the ice, water will seep
through to the snow and assist in sink-
ing the mass; this process can be has-
tened by flooding.

Surface flooding should not be done
against a forecast of higher than
twenty-five degrees night temperature.
Ice formation is relatively slow above
twenty degrees, but increases rapidly as
temperatures recede from that point.

Develop Pattern to Remove Snow

One problem every person handling
a large skating area must watch closely
is this: when you move snow mechanv~
ically it must be dumped only in shallow
areas away from the focal skating
point; warming house, pier, entrance.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a
pattern for moving heavy snowfalls.
Also where snow is piled on ice, the
warmth of the earth is sufficient to melt
the ice underneath, thereby creating
danger spots. On warm days it will
cause water to accumulate on the ice
surface which may cause trouble, espe-
cially on the odd warm sunny days when
ice under water melts more rapidly than
that which is exposed to the air and dry.

Also, the park board considering de-
velopment of an area for skating should
give careful consideration to the depth
of the body of water; the shallower it is,
the more quickly it freezes. To land-
scape architects we suggest that con-
tours be adapted to the problems in-
herent in working to get a sheet of ice
thick enough for skating and to remove
snow with light equipment, particularly
the light snow blower, which does not
create piles of snow along the shore.

In the 1956-1957 season, with about
five weeks’ of skating, attendance ap-
proached 60,000, based on a close es-
timate. On several weekends as many
as fifteen hundred people attended at
one time, proof that the interest in good
outdoor ice skating is still very real.
Skating is well worthwhile from the
standpoint of being one of the best out-
door winter activities in which the
wholc family, from the tot on double
runners to the old man and ma—who
still think they are good skaters—can
participate in together. #

Subdivision Ordinance

Wayne, Michigan, has adopted a new subdivision ordi-
nance to fulfill one of the requirements for its $3,000,000
urban renewal program. The ordinance provides for a plat
act agreement authorizing the village to dedicate certain
land for public sites. The planning commission may require
the dedication or reservation of land within the subdivi-
sion when the master plan indicates that a proposed park,
playground, school, or other public site will be located in
whole or in part in the subdivision. Furthermore, the plan-
ning commission may require similar dedication of sites
not anticipated in the master plan if the characteristics of
the subdivision, eSpecially large-scale neighborhoods, make
them necessary. Such an agreement is relatively new in the
state of Michigan, and the city has already successfully
defended itself in a $150,000 suit brought by a developer
charging duress—Public Management, April, 1958.

Largest Property Owner

The park department is the largest property owner
among New York City’s departments. The city owns more
than four billion dollars’ worth of real estate within its
borders. Parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, and swim-
ming pools are valued at a total of $1,084,560,850; this
exceeds by a considerable margin the value of properties
under the board of education.

How do your city’s parks rate in value with properties
controlled by other municipal departments?

Mutual Interests

In his annual report as president of the Minneapolis
Board of Park Commissioners for the year ending April 1,
1957, Dr. Roy E. Peterson stated:

“A notable contribution to community cooperation was
made during the year when, through conferences between
board members and officials of the village of Golden Val-
ley, agreement was reached to hold mutual consultations
whenever the interests of the residents in the suburban
communities might be involved in any action taken by the
board. This was followed by a meeting of park officials
from Minneapolis and representatives of a large number of
suburban communities, looking toward the establishment of
a permanent organization for the consideration of mutual
park problems.”

In his 1956 report, Dr. Peterson stated:

“Announcement of the preliminary plan of the new inter- ‘

state and state highway systems as they affect Minneapolis
has been a matter of great interest and importance during
the past year. It is noteworthy, I believe, that the highway
authorities are inclined to accept the suggestions and the
reservations as regards park properties, as contained in the
recommendations of the superintendent of parks and his

366

staff. Such acceptance displays and reflects the sound phi
losophy and the necessary foresight that underlies the pro

   
  
 

fessional operation of the Minneapolis Park Department.”

The same report also contained the following by Charles
E. Doell, superintendent of the board:

“Reference was made in the 1955 report to the sweeping
alterations to be made in the highway pattern of the city
by the state and national governments, in implementing the
interstate and state highway systems. The Minnesota
State Highway Department has submitted ‘a plan for this
interstate system for the city of Minneapolis, and it has con-
ferred with the park department and other agencies of the
city government concerning the likely impact of the estab-
lishment of such a system. The proposals have been -
studied by George Barton, national authority on the estab-
lishment of freeways, and his report, in general terms, con- .
firms the feasibility of the highway plan as it affects the
city of Minneapolis. The proposed system touches the park ‘
system at many points and affects the properties of the
board in several instances. A special report was submitted
to the board by the superintendent on the impact of the
proposed plan on park property. The Barton report is en-
couraging in its recommendations that the principles previ-
ously outlined to the highway department and set forth in
the 1955 annual park report concerning the general city
plan, and the necessity for preserving, as far as possible,

the recreation and aesthetic values of park properties now
in existence.”

Municipal Administrative Guide

Recreation executives will be interested in a section on
“Parks and Recreation” in Check List on How to Improve
Municipal Services, a publication issued by the Interna-
tional City Managers’ Association in Chicago. It is de-
signed to guide municipal officials in analyzing their pro-
grams, organizations, and methods of administration. The
section relating to parks and recreation, which was pre-
pared with advice from four authorities in that field, in-
cludes twenty-seven questions relating to various aspects of
departmental operation. Price is $2.00 a copy.

Neighborhood Conservation

City authorities who are concerned with neighborhood
conservation and rehabilitation will be interested in a re-
port entitled Neighborhood Conservation—a Pilot Study,
recently published by the Detroit City Plan Commission in
cooperation with the Housing and Home Finance Agency.
The purposes of the study were to examine Detroit’s "urban
renewal program, with particular reference to its planning
process and actual application to neighborhood conserva-
tion, and also to analyze and report the accomplishments of
the city’s conservation pilot project in terms of the planning
principles, methodology, and techniques used. The detailed
description of the series of planning, organizational, and
operational stages involved in the study and the policy de-
cisions drawn from it should serve as a valuable guide to
all who are concerned with urban renewal programs. Ad-
dress of the City Plan Commission is City-County Build-
ing, 400 Woodward Avenue, Detroit 26, Michigan. #

The 40th National Recreation Con-

gress was, in effect, a personnel Con-
Igress, from the standpoint of those
handling personnel. The Association’s
personnel staff, with the help of the
field representatives, held several hun-
dred personnel consultations with can-
'didates and employers. These involved
some fifty types of jobs, primarily in
municipal departments and state mental
1105pitals. Representatives from local
and state agencies, from Army Special
Services, the air force, and the national
American Red Cross were actively re-
cruiting through the week.

Greatest demand seemed to be for
assistant executives, supervisors, and
community center directors. The great-
est need appeard to be for women. Most
I of these positions were in the $4,500 to

new candidates registered with the
Association as a result of the Congress,

without imparting a
prison-like atmo-
sphere to the enclosed
grounds has always
been something of a
problem. The Panel-
Vent fence of galvan-
ized spring steel fin-
ished with baked en-
amel, in various colors, is one answer. It has the durability
of steel, the look of wood, and is said not to hold plant
damaging heat or cold. This fencing, particularly suitable
for demarcation and boundary uses, to separate swimming
pool from other recreation facilities, flower beds from paths,
for instance, is available in two- to six-foot heights, in hori-
zontal or vertical privacy style or picket style. For full de-

HOW
ABOUT
YOU?

Do you know that many cancers
can be cured if detected early?
That an annual health checkup
is your best protection against
cancer?

Are you giving yourself this
big advantage? Or are you
taking chances with your life
because of foolish attitudes
about cancer like these?

    

 DON’T
 EVEN
l MENTION
THAT
WORD!

Fear keeps

some pe0ple
from even learning cancer

facts that can save their lives.

NEVER FELT
BETTER!

  

Checkups help to detect cancer
in its “silent” stage before you
notice any symptom.

COSTS
TOO
MUCH !

Dollars you spend
for the protection
of your health can

M" mean years of life.

Millions of Americans have
made an annual checkup a

habit...f0r life. How about
you?

AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ®
I O

ONLY A disgracefully low seventeen
per cent of Americans read books,
dcspite our high literacy rate, according
to a 1957 Gallup Poll. This figure com-
pares very unfavorably with tiny Great
Britain’s fifty-five per cent. One of the
objectives of Children’s Book Week
this, and every other, year was to do
something about it. In this connection,
the National Book Committee feels that
reading aloud to children—a pastime
most children are mad about—will spur
them into wanting to read books on
their own, and may, in the long run, in-
crease the number of American readers.
How the child is read to makes all the
difference between his considering
books as delight or drudgery. Here are
a few hints to make storytelling more
fun, as offered hy Mrs. Margaret C.
Farquhar, from The New York Times.
Mrs. Farquhar is a Southport, Connecti-
cut, librarian and herself the mother of
four young children. ‘
0 Get comfortable in a large chair and
have the children cluster around you.

0 Let the children take turns ChOOSil
the stories they want to hear. RBI
some of your own favorites.
0 Build up suspense by changes in tl
inflection and loudness of your voice-
whispering dramatically before the e
citing parts and emphasizing certa
words by the tone of your voice. Chan;
your tempo to suit the story’s requil
ments—speeding up and slowing dow
depending on the action.
0 Let the children participate by sto
ping at certain places in the story
let them fill in some of the wor1
(“Rum run as fast as you can,
You can’t catch me, I’m the . . . . .
0 Laugh and smile with them at tl
funny parts; they love it.
0 Give beginning readers a chance
show off their skill by letting them res
aloud occasionally to the group. Mal
sure to praise their efforts.

Try these out as a group leader, 1
parent, as one of the devices to be
your children discover the wonderf‘

world of hooks. #

Honeycomb Candles

Sidney Dubin. Cleveland Crafts
Company, 4 East 16th Street, New
York 3. Pp.3l. Paper, $1.00.

Those readers who attended the Na-
tional Recreation Congress will remem-
her the Cleveland Crafts exhibit and
this new candle-making medium. Mr.
Dubin’s thirty-one-page manual gives
complete instructions for a number of

candle projects, along with explanatory
drawings and full-page photographs.

They are simple but effective craft
projects, useful for seasonal craft class-
es, such as those at Christmas time.
They offer a chance for progress in
originality of designs and decorations,
and are suitable for a wide age-range,
including older adults.

One wax sheet will make two sixteen-
inch candles, and at thirty-five cents
a sheet, the cost is moderate. Many of
the projects are for smaller candles.

American Folk Tales and Legends

Maria Leach. World Publishing

Company, 2231 W. 110 Street, Cleve-
land 2. Pp. 318. $4.95.

This beautiful book, written by an
authority on American folklore is illus-
trated by Marc Simont, the winner of
the Caldecott Award for the “most dis-
tinguished picture book for children
published in 1956.”

It would make a wonderful gift for a
child, but a recreation leader would also
find it a valuable addition to his library.
As a source of ideas for playground
themes, local festivals or pageants,
storytelling and story dramatization, it
is excellent.

An entire section of state lore, taking
each state alphabetically, gives the state
flower and bird, origin of its name, an-
ecdotes of its settlers, and highlights of
its history.

In addition, it has the stories of the
mighty men: Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
John Henry, Mike Fink (every section
of our country has one). The Bad Men

if this weren’t enough, there is a won-

Mexico, Central America, and South

The lively sketches and watercolor il-

The Art of Drying Plants
and Flowers*

Mabel Squires. M. Barrows, 425
Fourth Avenue, New York 16. Pp. 258.
$4.50.

This artistic book, telling how to col-
lect plants and flowers, dry them,
and use them in decorative and profit-
able projects, contains endless ideas for
capturing the color, beauty, and rich-
ness of natural forms. It tells how to
pick and dry flowers, fruits, vegetables,
foliage, nuts, seeds, pods, cones, gourds,
berries, grasses, herbs, wild plants,
and driftwood. Included are a color
wheel, showing the range of colors into
which plants will dry, as well as many
detailed charts listing plants and flow-
ers with their drying processes and
their colors when dried. Emphasis is
placed on the creative selection, design,
and arrangement of dried_forms suit-
able for home decoration. To enhance
their beauty, suggestions are given for
receptacles of various kinds that can be
found at home or purchased at a rea-
sonable cost. Also mentioned are the
mechanics for setting plant forms in
their containers, how to groom and
care for them. Other projects with great
possibilities are decorations for Christ-
mas, flower prints and plaques, pot-
pourri, sachets, and pomander balls.

The author has combined nature lore,
storytelling, and instructions in a
friendly informal style. Illustrations
are attractive and the print is large and
easy on the eyes. Although special at-
tention has been drawn to the adult
possibilities in this book, boys and girls
will find endless ideas that can be used
imaginatively and successfully.——-Shir-
ley Silbert, member of the Arts and
Crafts Committee of the NRA National
Advisory Committee on Recreation
Programs and Activities.

The National Park Wilderness

National Park Service, Washington

“Wilderness persists where nature i
free and only man’s actions are disc
plined.” This quote is typical of th
beautiful new pamphlet issued by th
National Park Service, which h a
chosen some of its most dramati
photographs, and simply, beautifi
written captions, to make a case for cori
servation of our wilderness and its na
tive wildlife. Actually, the booklet is
bricf summary of an intensive study
the record of the National Park Syste
since its beginning. This study w
basic to the planning of the ten-ye
improvement program for Mission 6
“ . and wilderness reaches outwa
from the roadside to be experienc
fully by those who penetrate it.”

Japanese Chess——

The Game of Shogi

E. Chara. Charles E. Tuttle Com-
any, Rutland, Vt., Pp. 182. $2.75.

Lindsay Parrott in his introduction
0 The Game of Shogi tells us that in
ssence shogi is chess.’ It is “played on
1 squared board by pieces moving in
iverse fashions with varying powers.
ts object is to checkmate the king. It
)oasts the curious, twisting move of
he knight, an earmark of chess and of
10 other game,” and yet shogi is not
:hess. Chess, as the scholars tell us.
iad its origins in India; as it spread
vest it deve10ped as we know it, and
u it went east it underwent the modifi-
ations known as shogi. Unlike chess,
hogi is fast, and offers excitement as
veil as intellectual stimulation.
E. Ohara, in a clear presentation, en-
bles the uninitiated to learn how to
)lay and really appreciate shogi. He
ays that shogi is a game of planning,
oresight, and imagination. His book
as one hundred and thirty illustra-
ions, helping one to see the moves, as
Well as read about them.
I In effect, the game itself is the re-
enactment of much of the social cus-
loms of the Orient. No Oriental eoun-
ry could perceive of more than one
king, so shogi has one king and a pre-
tender to the throne. Women were not
equal to men at one time in the Orient,
so there is no queen in shogi. No cap-
tured piece is dead, but rather joins the
side of the capturer. The warriors, like
- ny good soldiers, receive promotions,

Active Games and Contests *

Elmer D. Mitchell, Richard J. Don-
nelly, and William G. Helms. Ronald
Press, 15 E. 26th Street, New York 10.
Pp. 672. $6.50.

Any recreation leader who has been
on his job for any fair period of time
will recognize this title. The original
book, by Mason and Mitchell, held a
high place among game books. Bernard
S. Mitchell is now deceased, but he
would be gratified to see that this new,
revised, and enlarged edition still car-
ries the sparkle so characteristic of his
writing.

The book is a collection of around
two thousand different games, contests,
and special events for all ages and oc-
casions. The fact that it contains sec-
tions on roller-skate events, Pogo-stick
contests, track, r0pe jumping and skip-
ping, rope spinning, model-plane con-
tests, as well as a section on water ac-
tivities and winter activities, gives it a
coverage of active play not generally
found in a game book.

It is well organized and indexed, and
very comprehensive. The publisher has
given it excellent paper and a fine print
job. All this should warrant its inclu-
sion in every recreation library.

Creating with Paper *

Pauline Johnson. University of

Washington Press, Seattle, Washing-
ton. Pp. 208. $6.50.

During the last year at least a half
dozen fine books on papercraft have
been published (see “New Publica-
tions,” April and December 1957) . This
new book compares most favorably with
one of these, Shapes in Space, by Toni
Hughes, which was unusually stimulat-
ing and provocative.

In fact. from an education-recreation
point of view, Miss Johnson’s book will
be even more helpful to art and craft
leaders. Its many photographic illus-
trations add tremendously to the value
of the text and are fortified by instruc-
tion drawings.

The author explains that this book
originally was intended as a manual
for teachers. Through the cooperation
of other highly skilled teachers, a grant
from the Agnes H. Anderson Research
Fund, and the outstanding help given
by the Still Photography Production
Unit of the University of Washington,
it has expanded into a most thorough,
creative, and beautifully organized
book, so complete that it could be the
basis for many art and craft projects
for all age groups.

The preface, written by Trevor Thom-

as, British art educator, formerly with
UNESCO, sets the mood of the book
and is a delightfully personal and en-
thusiastic endorsement of paper as an
art medium.

With holidays approaching fast, the
art and craft department of any ageney
or department can find many creative
and beautiful ideas for decorations, fa-
vors, costumes, wrappings and the like.

Like any really fine book today, it
is expensive—but it gives full value for
its cost.—-Virginia M usselman, Program

Service, N RA.

Adolescent Views Himself

Ruth Strang. NicGraw-Hill, 330 w.
42nd Street, New York 36. Pp. 581.
$7.95.

Adolescents are being discussed and
scrutinized, and have been for some
time, in all types of writing. There is
no question that the adolescents of our
communities merit this kind of atten-
tion. They are important; they live in a
difficult world and are faced with both
long-standing and new problems of
growing up. Any addition to our knowl-
edge and understanding should add to
our . ability to help them in sound
growth toward maturity.

Adults often make the mistake of
talking instead of listcning, but Dr.
Strang’s title and beginning premise in-
dicate that this is a book devoted to lis-
tening and to learning more about teen-
agers. She has collected material from
the writings, comments, and discussions
of teen-agers, themselves, drawing upon
her own experience in studying, work-
ing with, and writing about them.

The reader anticipates a dynamic ap-
proach and stimulating, eye-opening
content. One’s expectations are some-
how never fulfilled. Dr. Strang has tried
to highlight her collccted material
against a basic knowledge of the devel-
opmental problems of adolescents, but
has given it a diffuse and disconcerting
presentation. When a short discussion
on adulthood and later years is inter-
jected, the reader is led away from
what should be maintained as the focus
—the adolescent’s perceptions of him-
self and his world. At other points, the
discussion deviates from its central
theme to a criticism of education, eom-
ment on use of facilities, the use of
literature to help adolescents, and com-
bating juvenile delinquency. These are
all interesting; they are important to
people who have a hand in the lives of
young people, and to citizens, generally.
Whether their place is here in a book
on the psychology of adolescents is an-
other question. I do not feel it is, except
as appendix material or as a final dis-
cussion of the implications of the mater-
ial for education, community planning,
guidance, and other areas. w

The additional material listed after
oath chapter is varied and sound. It
includes fiction and magazine articles,
audio-visual material, and articles from
professional journals, as well as some
basic books 011 adolescents.

My real concern is that what might
have opened our eyes further and been
a contribution to wiser and more con-
structive contacts with young people
never quite accomplishes that.—Wilma
Baizer, Assistant Director of Group
Work and Recreation, New York City
Youth Board.

All in Play—
Adventures in Learning I

Rowena M. Shoemaker. Playj
Schools Association, Inc., 41 W. 57th'
St, New York 19. Pp. 97. $1.00.

This spiral-bound, attractively illus-
trated booklet is a must if you work
with youngsters aged five to twelve. lts
contents arc so well summarized in the
introduction, no further review is
needed:

“For a long time you have asked for
a pamphlet on play that would be of
help to parents in the home; to teachers,
group leaders, counselors, and students,
wherever they may be working with
groups of children—in play schools,
day camps, settlements, housing (level-
Opments, in S t i t u ti o n S , hOSpitalS,
churches, and other public and private
agencies. . ‘

“All in Play is designed to help chart
a program for children of school age.
It emphasizes the how and why of play.
It stresses that learning goes hand in
hand with play when children have ex-
periences that are fun and are challeng-
ing as well_.

“The content has been ‘tried and
tested’ in the laboratory centers of the
association and in affiliated play schools
and day camps. By whatever name—a
play group or a day camp-—-wherever
children can play together, a prOgram
should evolve that will be as good as the
quality of leadership, plus the space,
materials, and equipment available.
The suggestion, the principles of under-
standing, and the processes of growth
described here can be adapted in any
community to insure better play pro-
grams f or children.”
