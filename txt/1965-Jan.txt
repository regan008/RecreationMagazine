PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY KIT 5-781
List Price: $36.00 School Price: $32.40

INDIAN SPRINGS SCHOOL
Helena, Alabama

We recently purchased a Cosom Hockey Kit and are amazed
at the total participation and enthusiasm expressed by ALL the
boys in our P. E. classes. It is a fine game for all concerned and
the benefits derived relative to teamwork, fitness and individual
worth is not able to be evaluated. In our Senior class we have
a little spastic boy who is not able to participate actively in our
regular P. E. program. I asked him to play goal for us one day
and he did a fine job. In all other game situations he would be
completely at a disadvantage but in this game he can hold his own.

for Tight Budgets

1 Kit Equips Up to 100 Player

   
   
  

COSOM HOCKEY offers unique values for phys

ical education and recreation; values not offere
by other equipment. One of those values it
amazing economy, in low first cost and also it
long life under hard usage. Another value is th‘:
number of players who can enjoy an excitim
game, with the best sort of physical conditioning;
in one day with but one kit.

COSOM HOCKEY affords about twice the activit°

of basketball. Since it is for the great majority who dd-1
not “make the varsity,” this game is played for £11ch
for excitement and for physical training; not to wi‘.
victories for a crowd. Young players enjoy a thorougJ,
workout in a few minutes, as the action is fast and
constant. Frequent substitutions for rest periods ari
needed. They are no problem in a game so simp'
and easily learned. No “stars” are essential to kee;
up the interest; quite the opposite!

  
 
 

30 minute to 45 minute game periods permit so man'o
and so advisable substitutions that as many as 11:
players on each of 2 teams will be given adequatt
exercise with proper rest periods “on the bench.” I'l'
one day, with 3 or 4 games scheduled, ONE kit equi "
100 or more players! And the COSOM kits can tag
that abuse for a long, long time. The durability cl
tough, flexible Polyethylene is amazing. There art
more than 7,000 kits in use and yet the replacementl
for broken or worn equipment is a bare trickle.

COSOM HOCKEY may be played indoors or Out; with
pucks for hard surfaces or balls for grass; under indoor
hockey rules or field hockey rules; by girls as well as
boys. For the greatest exercise, the greatest fun and
enthusiasm by the greatest number of participants . . . all
ages from 8 to 18 . . . hundreds of teachers, athletic and l
recreational directors and coaches tell us COSOM =

HOCKEY has no equal!

Even to the corners of a great city,
such as New York, winter brings
beauty with its magic tracery of
snow. This is the playground at
the Ottilie Home for Children in
Jamaica, New York. Photo by

rector with institutionalized and

Next Month

The international flavor of this is-
sue will mark the celebration of
Brotherhood Week, February 21-
28. “New Vigor in French Sports,”
by C. R. Agnew, Jr., will give an
excellent picture of a newly invig-
orated national program. In keep-
ing with the season, we will take
a look at winter sports and exam-
ine jam can curling in Winnipeg
and new T-bars in Duluth. You
won’t want to miss a look at the
host city for the 1965 National
Recreation Congress, “Beautiful
Minneapolis.” If any of your mu-
sic or performing arts groups has
ever discussed the possibility of
making a recording, you will need
the know-how offered in “Don't
Waste a Good Performance.” If
you have fiscal problems, you’ll
want to examine “What’s in a
Budget?” in which Joseph Curits
takes a fresh look at what should
be included and what could be de-

leted in this annual headache.

AN AFFLUENT SLUMLAND

Eric Sevareid

W ITH BREATH-
taking rapid-
ity we are destroy-
ing all that was
lovely to look at
a n d are turning
A m e r i c a i n t o
a prison house of
the spirit. What was once the fairest of
lands has become, by an increasing
number of competent judgments, the
ugliest community of man on earth.
Little wonder that European tourists are
reluctant to come here; what is there for
them to look at in most of what a British
publication calls “the mess that is man-
made America”?

 

The affluent society, with relentless,
singleminded energy, is turning our
cities, most of suburbia and most of our
roadways into the most aiiluent slum on
earth. There is not the slightest doubt
any longer that we are losing our very
special, God-given chance to create in
this country a form, an order, a high
civilization; this simply cannot be done
in a physical setting of crashing vulgar-
ity in the cities and dreary uniformity
in the suburbs.

What is happening to New York, our
richest city, a wonder of the world, once
beautiful and thrilling as a Christmas
tree, is pure vandalism in the name of
economic necessities. . . . All eminent
designers and city planners whose views
are on record are appalled by the gi-
gantic Pan American building astride
Grand Central Station. In its own cate-
gory, this is surely the cultural crime of
the century.

What makes a true and successful city
is mixture, variety. As Peter Blake pro-

MR. SEVAREID is a well-known news ana-
lyst and news correspondent for the C0-
lumbia Broadcasting System. This

material is taken from a guest editorial
he prepared for the American Land-
marks Celebration.

jects it [in his recent book God’s Own
Junkyard], our cities are becoming to-
tally “ghettofied” in terms of usage:
“Office ghettos, industrial ghettos, apart-
ment ghettos, amusement ghettos . . .
shopping ghettos . . . medical-center-
ghettos . . . so that most areas of the city
will be alive for mere fractions of each
day or week, and as deserted as Wall
Street on a weekend the rest of the
time.”

From this “cancer of uniformity, of
dreariness,” the great cities are dying
at the core of their spirit. Downtown
Los Angeles seems dead already; down-
town Detroit is dying; downtown New
Orleans is in the throes, and even San
Francisco now shows the blight.

The complex of forces doing this are
intricate and powerful, but not unstop-
pable as Blake has demonstrated. Nor
do the endless, dreary rows of the real-
estate developer’s suburbia have to be
repeated. There are far better ways; it
can be done if people generally under-
stand this, and will be done if people
generally learn just where and how to
express their demands and apply their
pressure. None of the present horror
was inevitable.

Endless vistas of townscape as well as
landscape have been violated in the in-
terests of what Blake calls “carscape.”
Much of our landscape can be restored
to view by laws aimed at the billboard
lobby. Who can disagree with Gov.
Brown of California: “When a man
throws an empty cigarette package
from an automobile . . . he is liable to a
fine of $50. When a man throws a bill-
board across a view he is liable to be
richly rewarded. I see little difference
between the damage done by these two
litterbugs.”

Surely, there is a vested public inter-
est in the American landscape and sure-
ly it is nonsense to say, as courts and
other authorities have said, that eco-
nomic interest is a necessity while es-

thetic interest is a luxury. It is nonsens
to say that what is beautiful and wha
is ugly are not subject to definition
that there are no standards. If we d-'.
not attempt to erect such standards an
enforce them, we are lost.

‘0 Play Package
yirs:

Last year you ran an offer of a free
talogue from our organization in
our free materials [Resource Guide]
tion. We were so impressed with
interest shown by your members in
r plays, and so appreciative of your
istance, that we decided to extend a
ial offer that should interest your
ders.
,We have selected a group of four one-
p plays which we will send, free and
tpaid, to any member of any recrea-
_ program writing on their letter-
‘ (l. The plays have been selected for
iety and ease of production—two
'ldren’s plays (The Gabawachee and
3’s Ugly Bride), a melodrama (The
'zer’s Daughter), and our prize-win-

ning comedy-drama (A Thing 0/
beauty).

There are no charges or strings at-
tached to this offer, although it does
represent a $3.75 value. It’s just our
way of saying “Thank you” to your
members for their interest, and to you
for your help. We do feel that your
readers will be most interested in the
reading copies of the plays we will be
sending them.

Safe Bicycle Paths

Sirs:

According to The Travelers Insur-
ance Companies about five hundred
cyclists are killed and fifty thousand
injured each year in collisions with
motor vehicles. A modern adequate
bicycle path should meet the following
requirements:

1. Be wide enough for at least two
riders to pedal side by side.

2. Be long enough, at least five
miles, to make the ride interesting.

3. Be hard-surfaced to avoid tire
damage. Cinders, sand, gravel, shells
are unsuitable. ‘

4. Avoid motor crossings wherever
possible.

5. Should end or run through points
of scenic or historic interest.

6. Be as far away as possible from
motor highways. Noise and exhaust

fumes are not conducive to a pleasant
and relaxing ride. There should be an
access road to the cycling path.

7. Be level . . . but a few rolling
hills might make it more interesting.
It might be planned along a lake, river,
or ocean front, or along an old canal
towpath, or along an abandoned rail~
road right-of-way.

8. Have shade trees for more plea-

surable summer cycling.
9. Have a bicycle-rental station at

either or one end. Rental from the
concession would provide funds for the
maintenance of the path.

10. Be clear of debris, glass, and
sand. Water pools should be drained
off.

Bicycle Touring League of America

dore Roosevelt High School, Bronx,

OFFICE IN
WASHINGTON, D. C.

s A PART of its expansion program, the National Re
A reation Association has re-established an oHice

Washington, D.C. to give special attention to feder-
and state recreation matters. With the greatly increased a-
tivity of the federal government in recreation and the gr0‘
ing amount of federal funds available to state and local go
ernments for recreation, the NRA recognizes that the 001-:
munities and recreation agencies it serves need more he:
than ever before in their relationships with federal agencitj.
Federal agencies also need the help and services which 
can provide through its long and deep experience in con
munity recreation matters.

The new NRA Washington staff will analyze, interprtj.‘
and report all pending federal and state recreation legislé
tion, and actively involve the NBA and its Service Asss
ciates and Afiiliates in the development offederal recreatio)‘
related activities. A part of the new Washington service wo"
be the periodic publication of T he Washington. Letter n
NRA which will automatically be sent to all affiliated ageLi
cies as an additional service. The first Washington Latte;
published in November, dealt with “Federal Assistance Pr:l
grams Available to States, Local Government, and No?
Profit Agencies for Resources.” I

The relationships NRA has established with key federt
agencies over the years will be particularly helpful in ii:
creasing the effectiveness of the Washington office. F ro:'.
1946 to 1963, the Association had an ofhce in the U. 5. D9:
partment of Interior and provided a staff person who serve:
as executive secretary of the Federal Inter-Agency Cornmii
tee on Recreation. This committee was disbanded in 1964
after the establishment of the Recreation Advisory Councl
by Executive Order of the President and the establishmeil
of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation by the Secretary of tkl

NRA’s flying researcher Dr. Bridgeman.

NRA has been granted a fixed-price
contract with the Corps of Engineers
to develop a technical manual on play-
ground equipment and area layout to
use on Corps installations in relation
to family housing. It is to include
recommendations both for preschool
and elementary school children. Be-
cause the manual must be suitable for
application to all geographical areas of
United States, a special visitation will
be made to approximately forty cities
throughout the entire United States. In-
stallations selected by the Corps in each
geographical region will also be visited.
Selected playground equipment manu-
facturers and surfacing materials con-
cerns will also be visited.

The project will be concerned with
the safety of equipment, the amount of
supervision needed, the construction
and maintenance features, the contri-
bution to physical development of the
child, popularity with children, et cet-
era. Surfacing and general layout and
design will also be a part of the proj-
ect. As a technical manual of the gov-
ernment, it will be available to the pub-
lic. The project is to be completed by
April 1, 1965. Dr. Bridgeman is a li-
censed pilot and will fly to various
areas in his private plane.

ANUARY, 1965

THEN THE ROOF FELL IN

WE HAVE COME through fire, wa-

ter, and brimstone, since our
December issue of RECREATION was
published, in order to bring you this
January issue at all. During the
night of December 6, when our J an-
uary and some of February copy
was awaiting processing at the
printing plant, disaster struck—fire
broke out and raged through every-
thing. As a result, only rubble,
ashes, and icicles remained to go to

press come the cold gray dawn.
Even the roof fell in. This disaster

meant chaos and inevitable delay,
and thus it is that we greet you la-
ter than we planned. Only through

) AMERICA has become a litter-filled
and defaced nation of pigs, according

to an angry article, “America Down
the Drain,” in the November 16, 1964

issue of Sports Illustrated, by Robert
H. Boyle. It is a closely written docu-
ment decrying the Obscenities being
perpetrated on the land throughout the
nation. A comment by Secretary of
the Interior Stewart Udall is printed
with the article. He calls Boyle’s anger
“fully justified,” and he says he hopes
Boyle’s sense of outrage will be con-
tageous. Both Udall and Boyle state
that unless conservation-minded people
unite and act the blight will continue.

government experts in social welfare,

and the needs of the populace and
the nation, in the promising leisure
of a new era. NRA’s anniversary
theme will be “Free Time—Hori-
zons Unlimited.” It brings back the
words of Joseph Lee, then president,
on the Association’s twenty-fifth
birthday: “Leisure for everybody, a
condition that we in America are

now approaching is a new thing un-
der the sun—the most revolutionary

thing that ever happened. It means
the coming of something unheard of
in all history—the opportunity of
every man to live. . . .” We have
reached it; it is here.

Fortunately, we had c0pies of ev-
erything. This emphasizes one of
the first lessons for editors: never
send anything to the printer—or to
anyone, even yourself—without hav-

which calls Mobilization for Youth a
meritorious pioneering demonstration
in the national effort against delin-
quency and poverty, has been released
by Acting Attorney-General Nicholas
Katzenbach, chairman of the Presi-
dent’s Committee on Juvenile Delin-
quency and Youth Crime.

The eight-man panel, which includes
a settlement house director, an edu-
cator, a leading criminologist, a social
work official, two foundation officials,
an economist, and an attorney, unani-
mously recommended “continued sup-
port for the full MFY program.”

The panel, which regularly advises
the President’s Committee on grants
made under the Juvenile Delinquency

and Youth Offenses Control Act, made
a special investigation following re-
cent allegations by several New York
newspapers of fiscal mismanagement,
subversive infiltration of the MFY
staff, and imprOper program activities.
Specific objections to the program were
directed to the community organiza-
tion programs for involving residents
in neighborhood affairs, which often
took the form of protest. The panel,
however, addressed its report not to
the specific allegations but to the gen-
eral effectiveness of the total MFY
program. its investigations involved a
three-day site visit to the Mobilization
for Youth area in New York City’s
Lower East Side, including observa-
tion of classes and job training, meet-
ings with staff. board, and city offi-
cials, and discussions with residents
affected by the program.

The panel concluded its statements
by suggesting that “the issues raised
in our discussion of the Community

9

Organization Program need to be
faced by all anti-delinquency programs,
and particularly by MFY because it
has progressed the furthest in this area
and is the most knowledgeable of these
programs.”

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

} PEOPLE WHO GIVE federal, state or
local governments scenic rights to their
p1 operty may deduct the value of the
rights from their income tax, accord-
ing to a recent ruling by the U. S. In-
ternal Revenue Service. The ruling was
the result of a successful effort to
block the construction of a high-rise
apartment project on the Merrywood
estate, Mrs. John F. Kennedy’s girl-
hood home on the Virginia'side of
the Potomac, near Washington. Ac-
cording to a UPI statement, govern-
ment oflicials foresaw a side applica-
tion to the ruling, particularly near
population centers where private de-
velopment threatens to spoil the view
from public recreation areas.

In giving the government “scenic
easements” on their land, a score of
people near Merrywood, have volun-
tarily agreed to keep their property
residential and not build anything
over forty feet.

D THE AVERAGE EMPLOYE has gained
the equivalent of nineteen days off a
year since World War II, as a result of
more holidays, longer vacations, and
shorter workdays, according to a bi-
monthly business report of the Chase
Manhattan Bank. The report estimates
forty percent of all managers, ofhcials,
and owners work more than forty-
eight hours a week, compared with
only twenty percent of the total em-
ployment labor force.

} A THREE-WEEK COURSE of intensive
study, designed for persons from other
countries who are directors of park
systems or are otherwise responsible
for the administration of national

parks and equivalent reserves, will be
presented by the Department of the
Interior in cooperation with the School
of Natural Resources, University of
Michigan, May 10-29. The Department
of Agriculture and the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature
and Natural Resources will assist with
the conduct of the course and the field
studies. The purpose of the course is
to review legislation, policy, planning,
and new developments in national
parks, with emphasis on the preserva-
tion and wise use of these resources.

} THE International Recreation Asso-
ciation has published Global View of
Recreation, a 172-page publication
which highlights organized recreation
programs for persons of all ages in
twenty-nine countries. Its publication
coincided with the convening of the
World Recreation Congress in Osaka
and Kyoto, Japan, October 2-7, 1964.
The report is available for $3.25 from

) THE 53RD Anniversary of Girl Scouts
of the USA. will be celebrated March
7-13.

) THE INFLUX of pleasure and business
visitors to the United States from over-
seas countries continued strong in Oc-
tober. The total for the month was
93,838, up 31.4 percent over the
October 1963 volume. This brings the
1964 ten-month total to 845,268, a rise
of 34.5 percent over the January-
October 1963 amount, and 110,000
more than the pleasure and business

provides the necessary land-use plan-
ning aid. Other federal and state agen-
cies provide additional help in line with
Secretary of Agriculture Freeman’s
objectives. The latter hopes to convert
much unnecessary cropland into rccrc-
ation areas that will increase family
farm income. For example, on George
White’s 169-acre dairy farm in Cilford,
New Hampshire, skiers swishing down-
hill replace the grazing cows of summer-
time.

The White farm hosts the Laconia
Outing Club when snow arrives. A small
warming but built by club members—
completc with stove, bubbling coffee pot
and a picture window—serves as the
base for skiing activities. A tow rope,
powered by an old car engine, pulls
skiers up the six hundred-foot slope.
The tow includes a homemade safety
gate approved by state inspectors. Dur-

Farm in Laconia does a special job
when the community holds the annual
world’s championship dogsled races.
The course, starting in town, runs twen-
ty miles through the Belknap County
farmland. Considerable training and
conditioning from both driver and dogs
are needed for the grueling race. There-
fore, Mr. Hubbard provides a practice
track on his 425-acre farm. Drivers and
dog teams from all over New Hamp-
shire’s lake regions take advantage of
Pleasant View’s eight-mile race course.

Downstate in Amherst, Orson Brag-
don, an active dairy farmer and Soil
Conservation District supervisor, has a
ski tow in his pasture. The six hundred-
foot rope tow cost him $750 to build
several years ago. Today, he estimates
the same installation would cost $2,000.
Skiers pay Mr. Bragdon a dollar each
for afternoon skiing privileges during
weekends and school holidays. The win-
ter recreation projects has added $1,000
gross to the farm’s income.

RECREATIIN’S
CHANGING

 

RILE

Eva Schindler-Rainman

 

every person in the United States, with far-reaching
implications for the recreation field. We are seeing
not only the increase in the movement of people from one
place to another, but the change of composition in com-
munities and neighborhoods. This change of composition
involves not only racial groups moving into areas where
they have not been able to live before, but also the mixing
in some neighborhoods of different social strata. This means
that the professional person and the well-paid vocational
person like the plumber may live in the same neighborhood.
This change is coming about because of the equalization of
wages between the professional and some of the labor
groups. We often think of change of community composition
only as racial mixture.

We are seeing emigration of people from all over the United
States and from other countries, and this is changing the
composition of communities. In Los Angeles, we have many
foreign students living with American families and adding
a new element to community life. These different and chang-
ing compositions at the center of a community affect the
recreation system. The implication here is clearly that plan-
ning for recreation must encompass knowledge about the
changing community and its everchanging needs.

An upheaval in employment potential is affecting all
communities, whether they are upper, middle or lower class.
We see an increase of employment in some areas, such as
the space field, and a decrease in other specialties, particu-
larly where automation has taken over. One of the groups
having difficulty in employment are civil and mechanical

employment since most engineering firms are depende

Recreation must serve a shifting population.

There are different groups of people out of work, rangi
from the unskilled to the highly specialized. We see in t
picture a great effort to retrain people who can no lon ;
find a job in their particular area of competence, but t
is a big question: “Retraining for what?” The implicati
for recreation is clear. We must educate people to spe
their leisure in successful and satisfying ways. Not only w
the work week be shorter, but unemployment may increa
giving people more time even if they do not want it.

CHANGES in the American family are an important asp
of change in general. Subsummed under this might

e to mothers’ groups where they can meet others who have
tilar experiences and problems. Nonworking mothers are
ependent of younger children sooner and need to seek
reation outlets other than at home. And, again, the rec-
tion system becomes an important part of the possibility
those outlets.
t is not normal in the 1960’s for young families to be
endent on their parents except perhaps financially for
tort period of time. Therefore, they must seek their out-
. in other areas. Furthermore, life expectancy is on the
rease, and therefore there is a larger range of customers;
is, the very young, the middle-aged, and the very old
1 be considered as potential patrons of a recreation sys-
. The question I would like to raise here is: “Do we
fly have programs that meet the needs of all of these
(13 of people, or do we still have programs that we think
rked ten years ago and therefore no change is necessary?”

NOTHER CHANGE that is not often discussed but certainly
is extant is the change in institutional services that we
seeing all the way across the United States. Historically
was the private agencies that did the experimenting with
' programs; today, it is the public agency, whether rec-
tion, public welfare, public health, or others which have
money from the federal government to do the experi-
nting. Increasingly, federal monies are available for all
s of programs, and the emphasis is on using federal
nies to develop new local programs. Has recreation availed
1f of this opportunity and, if not, why not?

crtainly we are also living at a time of social revolution.
ere is increasing emphasis on serving the poor, on giving
)ortunity to the culturally deprived, and building on the
ngths of these pe0ple to help them meet the needs and
blems of their communities and to develop programs that
I serve them best. One of the things that recreation might
it into is, “How can you help people in underserved neigh-
. hoods know what opportunities are available?” The
il rights struggle is another part of this revolution and
ans that we have to look increasingly to see whether we
J serving equally all segments of the population.

\n increased emphasis on education, regardless of socio-
nomic background, is another change we are seeing. It
)art of the social revolution also. Might recreation centers
e part in this new emphasis in interest by developing
dy dens where youngsters who do not have the kind of

where a quiet room is available might avail themselves
one or two rooms in the center for the purpose of doing
ir homework? Might it not be possible to devel0p volun-
rs who could tutor and help these youngsters?

HERE IS ALSO increasing interest in the world of arts,

and the implications here for recreation programs are
. ifold. These changes have additional implications for
Breation; they may already be happening; and some we
led to be aware of and taking part in.
Since change is all around us, are recreation programs
gauging too? To what degree? In what way? Increased
['vices to the poor must be developed. This implies, in turn.

yNUARr, 1965

that perhaps the professional person who serves in recreation
centers needs to have additional formal education or some
specialized in service training.

Increasing cooperation will be necessary between com-
munity agencies so that a total service may be given to the
peOpIe rather than overlapping or underlapping services. It
seems imperative that professional people—~committees, ad-
visory boards, whatever—need to examine a total neighbor-
hood or a total community and together plan how to serve
that community best. Recreation needs to be included, or
needs to include itself, in such a planning group. The neigh-
borhood must be represented on such a planning group by the
patrons or clients who live in the area. After all, it is they

who are going to be affected by the decisions made and the
services rendered.

Increasing study of the communities by the professionals
and by the advisory committees is necessary, because it will
be very important that programs be tailored to the needs
of the people in the community. This may mean that what
happens at one recreation center may be quite different from
what happens at another. For instance, there might be neigh-
borhoods where sports need to be increased and crafts and
arts decreased; or where a fine-arts program is needed most
because someone else is taking care of the athletic activities.

Increasing involvement of citizens in planning programs
and as volunteers in giving services is needed. Increasing
use of volunteers on all levels would certainly help extend
and enlarge recreation programs, and would involve in a
different way some of the citizens who live in the community.
For some people it is very recreational to be a volunteer.
helping with an activity rather than participating in it.

A larger range of program needs to be envisioned, whether
this is in the area of sports, arts, study dens, tutorial pro-
grams, discussion groups, or whatever area. There is really
no beginning or ending to what comprises recreation for
people.

As recreation professionals we have to sharpen our skills
in working with pe0ple. We need to know a great deal more
about what makes people behave as they do; what are the
differences between various groups in our society; and what
is their value system and life style and to what extent can
we tailor programs in relation to these.

More programs for single men are needed. In welfare
programs there is no place for him. In many of the struc-
tured organizations there is no place for him. The churches
have been in the forefront of offering some program for
single men, but recreation centers, too, have a responsibility
in this area. Since it is not the most acceptable middle~class
social habit to be single and male, this means that we have
really not integrated this group into our programs. This
group includes the young adult and the middle-aged single
man as well as the senior citizen.

Development of a series of activities and programs to
enhance man’s creativity and ability to depend on himself
rather than on others is necessary. New creative ideas and
ways of involving people must be developed if recreation is
to play the important part it can in the years ahead when
there will be much less time to work and much more leisure
time. #

REACHING YOUR

PUBLICS

Publicity and public relations for

parks and recreation leaders

Eric Lindsay

To TALK of publicity and public

relations is to talk of things we
see and do every day of our lives.
There is nothing mysterious about it
and there is no magic formula for c0n-
ducting either or both publicity work

and public relations work. At the out-
set, let’s separate the two subjects to

avoid any confusion.

Publicity is the thing we see every
day in our newspapers, in television
news, in magazines, on outdoor bill-
boards, on bus car cards, in neon lights,
on banners, on sidewalk stencils. Just
about everywhere you look in any
North American community you are
confronted With publicity.

The objective of this vast flood of
publicity, in all its forms, is to con-
vince you, the consumer, to use a prod-
uct; to buy something; to get up and
go somewhere; to sleep well, to wake up
refreshed; to smell good; to run, not
walk to the nearest marketplace and
spend your money. Yes, some publicity
almost goes so far as to tell you to drop
dead—but when you do please specify
Joe Ghoul’s Mortuary for the burial.

Public relations, on the other hand,
might best be summed up in the simple
phrase: How You Get Along With
People. PR means your relations with
various groups, with various individu-
als, with various publics. As leaders in
parks and recreation, who are your pub-
lics? From the viewpoint of a park and
recreation board or commission or de-
partment, the most important and most
valuable of all the publics with whom
your relations must always be topnotch
is that body of voting Opinion known as
the taxpayer or the ratepayer.

 

MR. LINDSAY is public information of-
ficer for the Board of Parks and Public
Recreation in Vancouver, British Co-
lumbia. This material is taken from a
talk delivered by Mr. Lindsay to sum-

mer playground leaders in the Vancouv-
er area.

Parks and recreation commissions,
wherever they are, as long as they are
dependent on the public purse for mon-
ey for their acquisition, administration,
and deve10pment programs, must be
constantly aware of the delicate sensi-
bilities of the taxpayer. Like all of us,
he can react in any way he wishes to
the publicity hammers that crash
against his skull. He can buy or he can
get up and go or he can stay home and
refuse to spend his money and thereby
put the lie to the advertising industry’s
contention that anything will sell if it
is publicized violently enough and long
enough.

The same thing holds true for the
taXpayer when he is asked to make a de-
cision that will cost him money in con-
nection with parks and recreation. As-
sume his being invited on a certain date
to mark a ballot asking him to support
a money bylaw for a couple of million
dollars with which the local park com-
mission intends to have a swank new
community center constructed. The tax-
payer is free to make up his own mind
about whether to mark a YES or a NO
on the ballot. If his majority decision
is NO, then parks and recreation is set
back until the taxpayer can be asked
again, and perhaps even a third time,
to approve this request for more of his
hard-earned cash.

SOME parks and recreation depart-
ments have had excellent results
in going to John  Taxpayer for funds
and you can be sure there was a great
deal of what we might call the organiz-
ing type of public relations behind
some of these successful money bylaw
campaigns. It is not fair then to sug-
gest that a continuing program of main-
taining good relations with the taxpay-
ing public all year round, year after
year, can help create a receptive attitude
for the day when the taxpayer is invited

came r1113 CENTURY in the Unit-

D ed States, there has been a rising
demand for recreation areas

with scenic physical landscaper—often
a forested setting with numerous lakes
interspersed between mountains and
hills. Within such an environment, va-
cationers can enjoy a wide range of ac-
tivities, from the more arduous sports
of hiking and swimming to the quieter
pursuits of picnicking and sightseeing.
Consider the Adirondack area in
northern New York State. within the
borders of Adirondack State Park and
encompassing almost all of the state’s
Adirondack mountain region. This area
accounts for a fifth of the total area of
New York. It has been historically a
highland region of great scenic beauty.
Its mountains rise two thousand feet

The Adirondacks have long been rec-
ognized as a recreation area for the
sportsman and tourist. and today the
business of recreation is the only major
economic activity. Through trial and
error, the mountains have proved not
generally useful for most other eco-
nomic pursuits. Today, forty percent
of the land within Adirondack Park is
state-owned forest preserve. The re-
maining sixty percent is in private
hands.

A study of past and present recrea-
tion development of the mountains en-
ables one to identify fairly distinct pe-

riods of use. Before 1841, the Adiron-
dacks were virtually unused as a recre-

iI-derness country. The high peak area of the Adirondacks region which covers a fifth of the total area of New York State.

ation area. Accessibility to the moun-
tains was poor and travel through them
worse still. Those who wished to go in-
to the Adirondacks had to endure a wa-
gon ride over teeth-rattling potholes on
roads used by lumber wagons. The gen-
eral slowness of transportation virtually
eliminated most of the population of a
city like New York from enjoying the
attractions of the mountains. The com-
mon man of the day did not have the
leisure time—or the money—to make
the trip. The wealthy did not have to
travel as far as the Adirondacks, for
Long Island, described in those days as
a hunting and fishing paradise, lay
much closer.

There was a general lack of knowl-
edge about the Adirondacks at this
time. No land survey had been made,
and it was generally felt that the moun-
tains were smaller in size than the Cats-
kills. What little recreation activity
there was before 1841 involved hunt-
ing, fishing, and sightseeing. Occa-
sionally, the wealthy and socially elite
groups who sipped mineral water on
the piazzas of hotels at Saratoga would
travel north into the mountains to visit
the ruins of Fort William Henry at Lake
George.

In the second period of use, from
1841 to 1865, a small but increasing
number of sportsmen entered the moun-
tains and the first lodging facilities to
accommodate them began to appear,
encouraged by the extension of the rail-
road which reached the fringes of the
area and new steamboat transportation
available on Lake George and Lake
Champlain. Also, by the 1840’s., many
people were deve10ping an increasing
distaste for the growing urban-indus-
trial environments they found them-
selves in, and they longed for the nat-
ural settings they had once known.
Coupled with this was the development
of the physical recreation movement,
which was to bloom forth in the East
in the 1850’s. New England intellectu-
als took the lead in pointing out that
Americans, who had once achieved their
exercise through the strenuous physical
activity required on the frontier and
small farm, were undergoing a physical

decline.

In the next period of recreation use,
from 1865 to 1920, the Adirondacks
were heavily patronized by the wealthy

and well~to-do classes, who vacationed
at the many resort hotels built during
this period or who built their own or-
nate camps, often on large private pre-
serves. The great increase in recrea-
tion use of the mountains in this pe-
riod after 1865 is explained by the great
improvement in accessibility to them af-
forded by the extension of the railroad
into, and, in one case, entirely through,
the mountains. Hotel construction oc-
curred along the shores of lakes adja-
cent to these new lines.

In addition to this, there appeared, in
1869, a book written by the Reverend
William Henry Harrison Murray, called
This
volume, not unlike other works already
published on the mountains, caused
somewhat of a rush of tourists to the
Adirondacks. A key to understanding
the book’s impact was the fact that it
gave eXplicit instructions as to how to
travel to the mountains, and where ac-
commodations might be found. The
sudden influx of tourists into the Adi-
rondacks overtaxed the meager accom-
modations then in existence and stimu-
lated hotel building. Murray’s book was
soon followed by the appearance of sev-
eral annually published guide books.

In the latter part of this period from
1865 to 1920, the Adirondacks enjoyed
their greatest popularity as a play-
ground for the wealthy. The hotel in-
dustry boomed—as did the building of
ornate camps—and wealthy persons like
J. P. Morgan often traveled weekly, in
the summers, from New York City to
the mountains in private railroad cars.
It was during this time that the forests
in the mountains were closed—“locked
up” as the natives described it. The
Adirondack State Park was created and
all squatters on state land within the
park were removed. A strict interpre-
tation of the “forever wild” amendment
to the state constitution in 1894 pre-
vented any public recreation develop-
ment on state land. Also, huge private
preserves were carved out of the Adi-
rondack forests, fenced off and patrolled

by private game wardens.

A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD of recreation
use occurred from 1920 to 1941,

with the advent of the family automo-
bile and the hard-surfaced highway. In-
terest in the Adirondacks as a play-

ground for the wealthy declined, due
heavy property taxes, the lure of oth
areas, and the loss of exclusiveness. T
wooden resort hotels of the previous e
experienced a sharp dr0p in business,

plan for using abandoned railroad
rights of way to develop an extensive
network of hiking and bicycling trails
throughout the country. “A happy
triple coincidence—the physical fitness
program, abandonment of railroad
rights-of-way, and two measures passed
by Congress this year—has given the
United States an opportunity we mustn’t
miss to improve our grossly inadequate
facilities for hiking and cycling,” says
Rep. Reuss. “For years, Americans
traveling in Europe have enjoyed the
marvelous hiking and cycling facilities
there and wished we had something to
match them. The heavy use of the few
hiking and cycling trails we have—
such as the C 81 O Tonathlfrom Wash-
ington, D.C. to Cumberland, Maryland,
or the cycling roads on Nantucket—
show that Americans like to go places
under their own power.

“Establishment of networks of hiking
and cycling trails like those in the Neth-
erlands, Germany, and Great Britain

would give us a great new recreation
asset." declares Rep. lieuss. “Three
circumstances have converged to make
this the time to catch up with Europe‘
There is renewed interest in the physi-
cal fitness of our people and a sharper
realization that too many \mericans
have become soft as a result of spectator
sports and the lack of good opportuni-
ties for vigorous outdoor recreation.
Long stretches of railroad rights-ni-
way, which are ideally suited for devel-
opment as biking and hiking trails, are
being abandoned every year. Since the
heyday of railroading in 1918, an esti-
mated forty thousand miles of railroad
rights-oi-way have been abandoned,
and quite a hit of it never used for an)
other purpose. In the last six years
alone. railroads have ended service on
eighty-two hundred miles of rights-of-
way. If the trend toward railroad merg-
the abandonment of
parallel lines may well make land avail-
able at an ex en faster rate. \ets passed

ers continues,

 

by the 88th Congress provide the means
for buying and developing the rights-
of—way. The Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund Act provides as much as
$90,000,000 a year for states and locali-
ties for acquisition and development of
land for recreation purposes. Edward
F. Crafts, director of the Bureau of
Outdoor Recreation which administers
the act, told me that ‘projects to increase
bicycling opportunity are among the
kinds of projects which will be eligible
to receive assistance.’ The Economic
Opportunity Act provides, in the Job
Corps and in the work-training pro-
gram, manpower that could be used to
develop railroad rights-of-way for rec-
reation.”

Since railroads usually remove the
tracks and ties, the road bed could be
prepared for cycling merely by smooth-
ing it out, Rep. Reuss points out. Way-
side shelters and paving would be op-
tional. In some cases, old bridges might
have to be strengthened or replaced by
light suspension structures.

There are already several pilot ef-
forts to use abandoned railroad rights-
of-way for recreation—on a thirty-mile
stretch near Sparta, Wisconsin, and on
old ways between Chicago and Elgin,
Illinois, and between Baltimore and the
Pennsylvania state line.

“There are many other opportunities
to turn relatively useless long, narrow
strips of land into real community as-
sets with federal help, if citizens and
state and local governments will take
the initiative,” Rep. Reuss stresses. At
his suggestion, an exploration of bi-
cycling paths and of railroad rights-of-
way suitable for recreation use is being
included in the Department of Com-
merce’s Scenic Roads and Parkways

Study, scheduled for completion late
next year.

Illinois Prairie Path
MANY GROUPS in the Midwest are

putting on an active campaign to
establish an Illinois Prairie Path sys-
tem along the right-of-way of the de-
funct Chicago-Aurora and Elgin Rail-
way. The proposed path has received
the enthusiastic endorsement of many
groups and individuals who see the pro-
ject as one which they can utilize for
their own programs, which can provide

18

a good community service, which can
establish a green ribbon of beauty from
Cook and Kane Counties through Du-
Page County.

The Prairie Path is one of the pro-
posals of the Open Lands Project of
the Welfare Council of Metropolitan
Chicago. The Open Lands Project,
a Chicago foundation-supported pro-
gram, has as its objective the acquisi-
tion, preservation and conservation of
open land in the total metropolitan area.
The Welfare Council is a federation of
268 health, recreation and social serv-
ice agencies in Cook, Lake, and DuPage
Counties, combining their strength to
create a better environment for living.
The council includes not only the youth-
serving, recreation, public parks and
forest preserve agencies, but also the
health and family welfare groups that
are equally aware of the importance of
open playlands for a balanced life. The

proposed Prairie Path has many rami-
fications:

Background. About five years ago, the
Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railway
ceased operation after many years of
providing commuter service to Chicago
from its western suburbs. Since then
the right-of-way has been abandoned,
the tracks and ties have been sold and
removed, the stations have been sold
or rented.

Present Uses. In addition to ownership
by the railroad, Commonwealth Edison
maintains power lines over the major
portion of the right of way. This com-
pany purchased many of the railroad
rights over the years and has acquired
fee title to a portion of the right-of-
way. It also has perpetual easements
over the entire system for its power
lines. In some areas the original land-
owners have cultivated portions of the
right of way. The remainder of the
property is standing idle. There is some
usage of the road bed as an alley and
a dumping ground.

Some PrOposed Uses. Consideration
has been given by the State Highway
Department to an inter-community
highway on the right-of-way. This has
encountered opposition in the suburban
towns (like Lombard, Glen Ellyn,
Wheaton) because it would mean add-
ed trafiic through the centers of these
communities. Suburban officials would
much prefer the establislm‘lent of park-

suing this use.

growing communities in DuPage Cou
ty and with a need to make provisi

DuPage County Board of Superviso
would like to acquire the right-of-w

Strip Film. A ten-minute film strip with
recorded connncntary has been pro-
duced by the Open Lands Project, to
call attention to the possibilities of the

are being made to have the film shown

area.

Bicycle Channel

THE LIFE of a pedestrian or bicyclist
is an extremely dangerous one, if

not unbearable, in Southern California
where only limited public transporta-
tion is available. There are more cars
in California per person than in any
other state of the union. In California,
the city of Pico Rivera, with a popula-
tion of fifty thousand is geographically
sliced into ten sections by major streets
and highways. The elongated city,
bounded on the east and on the west by
the San Gabriel and the Rio Hondo
River Channels, offers little or no room
for the citizen to hike or bicycle without
crossing a major thoroughfare within
three-quarters of a mile.

The number of bicyclists involved
with automobile accidents was mount-
ing. The city took steps to correct the
bicycling problem by installing a safety
program in all the local schools through
classroom visitations of a specially
trained oIBcer. The Pico Rivera Park
and Recreation Commission also took
this problem on for study, and ulti-
mately recommended that the river
channels bordering the city be explored
for recreation uses. As the channel floor
is of concrete with a width greater than
sixty feet, it appeared ideal for the bi-
cycling program. The Rio Hondo River
is normally dry year-round except dur-
ing the rainy season or when the Los
Angeles County Department of Flood
Control releases stored and controlled
water to replenish underground storage
basins. This department has complete
jurisdiction over the river, its bed,
channel, and adjacent properties.

\Vrittcn and verbal communications
were exchanged for over a year between
the city and the Los Angeles County
Department of Flood Control. After
considerable negotiation, both the city
and the county established procedures
whereby local citizens are able to take
advantage of a supervised fifteen-mile
bicycle-trails program in the Rio llondo

River Channel and its concrete bed.

On April 2, 1964 the Los Angeles
Flood Control issued a permit to the
city of l’ico Rivera for use of the chan-
nels with some of the following condi-
tions:

0 Proper liability insurance be provid-
ed the district covering proposed use.

0 Each trip be thoroughly supervised.

0 Notification be given the Department
of Flood Control in advance of each
scheduled trip.

This was a major breakthrough as far
as a recreation pursuit in flood control
properties.

Setting up of the first “test ride”
was done in conjunction with Warren
Asa, Western regional director of the
American Youth Hostels. A member of
the city's recreation stall attended a
hostel training program, thereby learn-
ing of potential problems of group bi-
cycling. The local bicycle shops were
contacted regarding the new program.
Each agreed to assist in publicizing it
and offered other assistance wherever
needed. The initial test ride took place
on Saturday, May 30.

William J. Paeilico, director of parks
and recreation in Pico Rivera, says,
“Here is one area of need that was
solved by two political agencies. The
cost of the new program was minimal,
as no new trails had to be acquired and
developed. The taxpayer has gained
through this new program, taking ad-
vantage of a facility that had already
existed, but was put to a new use."
(F or another example of cooperative
effort in Pico Rivera, sec “To Better
Advantage,” RECREATION. April 196-1.)

A Break for Pedestrians

served strictly for pedestrians, re-
ports France Actuellc. During various
designated hours, no vehicle may enter,
circulate or park in them. So far. eigh-

many happy walkers and shoppers have
benefited from these newly decreed re-
strictions against wheels, motor noises
and fumes. Tourists will particularly
appreciate the ban on motor traflic dur-
ing periods of the day and night in the

This is the first of a
three-part article dealing with
city, county, and state recreation areas

RECREATION
AREA STANDARDS: a]
The City

Leslie Lynch

TODAY, when we face the problems of
rapidly increasing population and
urbanization, when the importance of
public open space for recreation and
conservation is more widely recognized,
it is helpful for cities to know where
they stand as to such areas in relation
to their own needs and standards and in
relation to other cities. Open space and streets constitute
the framework or skeleton on which the city is built. If that
framework is well conceived and planned, the city can grow
old gracefully and can build and rebuild through the cen-
turies without radically changing the framework.

With the knowledge of city planning now available in the
United States, it is tragic that the new urban areas being
built at such a tremendous rate since World War II are so
uninteresting in pattern and so deficient in open space. Open
space not only does much to make the urban environment
attractive but it enhances and stabilizes property values.
Besides, open space helps to keep the ground water table
at a proper level and helps to preserve the delicate balances
in nature that are so important.

Accurate and up-to-date information in the acreage of

 

parks and other recreation areas in cities is not readily
available. The Recreation and Park Yearbook—1961 is the
only compilation of such information and it is not complete
because some municipalities do not report at all and many
do not give complete information. Most cities report their
park and other municipally owned recreation areas quite
accurately, but many do not report the acreage of recreation
area on school sites. It is probable also that some of the

parks owned by cities are outside their city limits, but the
is no indication of this fact in their report. Consequentl
the figures on the percentage of the city area in public re
reation lands are in some cases inaccurate. However, '
spite of the inaccuracies, the information given in the a
companying table is of interest and of value in a gener
way.

The table lists the fifty largest cities in the United Stat
with their populations as given in the 1960 report of t
Bureau of the Census. Information as to the land area an
the population per square mile is also taken from the Cens
report. 0f the fifty cities listed, four did not report for th
Recreation and Park Yearbook—1961; therefore the co
putations involve only the forty-six cities that did repo
acreages.

The significant information gleaned from this table an
the conclusions or assumptions drawn therefrom are set fort
in the following paragraphs.

1. Considering as a unit the forty-six cities that reporte
recreation acreages for the Recreation and Park Yearboo
—1961, the following information is gained from the tab]
0 For all forty-six cities, there were 7.0 acres of recreatio
area per thousand of the population in 1960.

0 For all forty-six cities, the area in recreation comprise
7.8 percent of the total land area within the city limits.

0 The total population gain between 1950 and 1960 w

6.7 percent.

o The average gross density of population in 1960 wa
7,118 per square mile.

2. Eleven (24%) of the forty-six cities have ten acres or
more of park and other recreation area per thousand of thl
1960 population. Considering these eleven cities as a uni
there were 19.4 acres of recreation area per 1000 of the 1960

popBJation; twelve percent of the city area was in recreatiol

tween 1950 and 1960, and the population density was 3,952
square mile in 1960. Only three of the cities had more
Eran 19.4 acres of recreation area per thousand population.
nly one of the cities had a density of population in excess

population between 1950 and 1960. The seven cities which
have population densities of less than six thousand per
square mile will probably increase considerably in popula-
tion; therefore, at least three of the seven should increase

their recreation area in order to retain their desirable pro-
portion of open space.

3. Twenty-two (46,532) of the forty-six cities gained ten
percent or more in population between 1950 and 1960. Con-
sidering the twenty-two cities as a unit; the population gain
was 35.9 percent; there were 10.8 acres of recreation area
per thousand of the 1960 population; the population den-
sity was 3,724. per square mile; and only 6.3 percent of the
city area was for recreation space. Seven of the cities had
more than ten acres of recreation area per thousand of the
1960 population, but, with a few exceptions, the recreation
area should be considerably increased soon because the pop-
ulation will greatly increase undoubtedly. With four excep-
tions these were Southern or Far Western cities.

4. Seventeen (37%) of the forty-six cities lost popula-
tions ranging from 0.3 to 13 percent between 1950 and 1960.
Considering the seventeen cities as a unit, the p0pulation
density was 14,638 per square mile. Although 11.6 percent
of the city area was in recreation area, there were only 5.1
acres of such space per thousand population. With a few
exceptions, the density of the p0pulation and inadequacy of
open space for recreation were undoubtedly strongly con-
tributing causes of the decrease in population. With perhaps
two or three exceptions, the open space for recreation should
be increased in these cities through the years ahead.

These statistics show that the generally accepted standard
for municipalities of ten acres of recreation area per thous-
and of the population is not only a highly desirable goal
but one that is being surpassed by many cities. The figures
also show that cities which are rapidly increasing in popula-
tion need to be very active in providing additional open
space for recreation or the desirable ratio of open space to
population will be lost. Cities are primarily places in which
to live. Consequently they should be beautiful, spacious,
planned for convenience. Open space for recreation is one
of the very important factors contributing permanently to
all three requirements. :,‘,."

WHEN THE thirteen colonies became one, there
were six hundred acres for every man, wom-
an, and child. Today, we are down to 13% acres.
In twenty-five years there will be only eight. (In
Connecticut today, it is one acre per person.) . . .
We often read that our land is being developed
at the rate of three thousand acres a day and most

of that is being done in our metropolitan areas . . .

All of these facts and many more . . . [point] up the
necessity for a thorough analysis of the use of our
land and water resources to determine how . . .
recreation needs may be met.—ALLEN '1‘. ED-

OVER TWENTY-THREE different pieces of federal legis-
lation are available to parks and recreation depart-
ments for the acquisition of recreation lands. Administra-
tors should constantly examine and review these as they seek
to expand their areas, facilities, and programs. Acts such as
the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman-Rob-
ertson) and the Federal Aid in Fish Restoration and Man-
agement Projects Act (Dingell-Johnson) make available
certain funds for the restoration of fishing and hunting areas
and annually amount to sizeable funds for the development
of more recreation lands. Others are related to the game and
fishing aspects of recreation such as the Fish and Wildlife

Coordination Act of 1958 and the latest, the National Wild-
-' life Refuge Revenue Sharing Act (Public Law 88-523) . All

of these acts relating to hunting and fishing may serve to
emphasize that you may want to include more of these ac-
tivities in your recreation programs. The more of this you
can include in your overall approach to recreation, the more
people you can serve. How many children today are denied
an opportunity to hunt and fish because there are no facili-
ties near enough? How many have never held a fishing
rod?

The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of
1954 (Public Law 566) makes available funds on a sharing
basis for the improvement of small watersheds. Washing-
ton has received some 2,137 applications, with 569 approved
for operations involving over 32,523,000 acres; 1,002 have
been approved for planning assistance. Every state, with
the exception of Alaska, is participating in this program.

The Area Redevelopment Act has been used by many
areas, many communities, many organizations for the de-
velopment of recreation lands, as well as acquisition. The
flow has slowed down presently, but this is not a source to
be ignored completely by sections of the country qualify-
ing for consideration.

Under the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962, particularly
Title IV, the availability of loans to individuals and asso-
ciations has received widespread acceptance in a number
of sections of the country. Overnight the complexion of
recreation land development and acquisition took on a rosy
glow to private enterprise.

times there are features that make for awkward arran

Another act that closely parallels the Surplus Prope
Act is the Recreation and Public Purposes Act of 19
which deals primarily with lands under the jurisdiction

lands sell for $2.50 per acre and lease for $.25 per acre I

of Land Management.

Additional legislation may more properly be referred
as a series of acts: The Housing Acts of 1949, 1954, 19
and 1964. It is within this series of acts we find the Housi
and Home Finance Agency with the various programs, m
familiarly known as the Open Space Land Program, the 7
Grants, et cetera.

A new addition to the list of legislative measures at y
disposal is the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Exa .
how and where all aspects of this new legislation will unf

veral places within its setup where organizations or p0-
ical subdivisions may receive assistance in land acquisi-
. . This is particularly true within Title III, special pro-
ams to combat poverty in rural areas. There will be grants
ailable to low-income rural families for assistance, and
‘~ ong those items mentioned are participation in cooper-
ive associations and participation in nonagricultural enter-
ises which will enable such families to supplement their
come. These could well be recreation-type enterprises.
anted this form of assistance is not available for the mu-
cipal or political subdivision agency involved with recre-
ion. However, there may be other aspects of providing
chnical assistance and guidance under the Economic Op-
rtunity Act of 1964 that may involve your organizations.

EVERAL OF THE ACTS should receive special emphasis and
’ consideration in recreation land acquisition programs:

he Surplus Property Act of 1944-. Constantly changing
eds and advances in technology make for the release of
nds that have been in public ownership. The General Serv-
5 Administration, as custodian of all federal lands, advises
deral agencies when certain parcels are considered excess
I the operating agency. If there is no further need for the
nd by any federal agency, the tracts may then be declared
rplus to the needs of the government. At this time, the
ailability of such lands may be passed on to appropriate
- te officials. If it is land that has recreation potential, the
ureau will make certain that the Bureau of Outdoor Rec-
ation liaison official designated by the governor will be
formed that this land is available. Here is where you need
I be making your needs known within your own state. You
ould have the framework organization to receive and, in
m, pass on this data as soon as it becomes known. Time
. of essence to make your desires known to the General
rvices Administration. There have been unfortunate oc-
. ions where a state outdoor recreation agency was not
dvised in time to make its needs known and the surplus
nd then passed on to commercial ownership. We do not
ve so much land and facility available at the previously
ntioned fifty percent appraised value to be used for park
nd recreation purposes that we can trust our luck to being
dvised well enough in advance to take action.

he Open Space Land Program of the Housing and
' ome Finance Agency. A recent summary on the first three

years of this program provides some very interesting figures.
Some of these statistics show that many people are not using
the opportunities that exist for the acquisition of land. For
the period of the fiscal years 1962-1961, the number of
grants ran: Far West, 23%; Northeast, 22.85"}; Midwest,
22%; Mid-Atlantic, 19.2%; but only eight percent for the
South and five percent for the Southwest. Surely this does
not mean that the South and Southwest have no need for
additional open space land nor does it mean that the Far West
is the shortest on land? Hardly! It shows an awareness of
an aid program of some 20—30 percent funds being avail-
able. Open space land can be a good adjunct to your recre-
ation land acquisition program. Check into it. Use it.

The Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. The bureau is an
agency in the Department of the Interior established to
serve as the focal point in the federal government for the
many‘ agencies concerned with outdoor recreation. The
bureau’s policy guidelines for outdoor recreation matters
stem from the Organic Act ( Public Law 88-29) which spe-
cifies the activities concerning outdoor recreation, such as
research, regional cooperation, technical assistance and
nationwide outdoor recreation planning. (RECREATION has
published a number of articles on the BOR: “Outdoor Rec-
reation for America,” October 1963; “Outdoor Recreation
in America,” March and April 1962; “The President’s Plan

[or Expanding Recreation Areas,” April 1962.)

The Land and \Vater Conservation Fund Act of 1965
(Public Law 88-578) is a source of financing outdoor rec-
reation. Appropriations will be made from this fund to
provide outdoor recreation areas and facilities at local,
state, and federal levels. The fund became effective January
1, 1965, and the life of the fund is twenty-five years. About
sixty percent of the fund will be available for state purposes;
that is, available to the state and to the political subdivisions
of the state, forty percent of the fund will be available to
certain federal agencies for outdoor recreation needs. (Spe-
cific provisions of the act were covered in RECREATION, No-

vember 1964.)

It has been said that the land in which we live belongs
to a vast family of which many are dead, few are living.
and countless numbers are still unborn. Here, we have a
vast Opportunity, wholly apart from economics and the

dollar sign, to recognize a debt to the past and to assume a

responsibility to the future. #-

Stay-at-Home Recreation

THE BUILDER who limits a planned
apartment community to the basic
“four walls and a ceiling” and fails to
consider the varied recreation needs
of “increasingly sophisticated” tenants
is considerably behind the times in this
competitive age, in the opinion of one
of New York City’s apartment house
builders. W’ith sports and other recrea-
tion activities now in the realm of big
business, builders can no longer afford
“to be merely landlords,” says Samuel
J. Lefrak, whose forty-acre $150,000,-
000 apartment complex rising in Forest
Hills, Queens, will eventually house
twenty-five thousand persons. This res-
idential community, known as Lefrak
City, already houses fifteen thousand
persons.

Mr. Lefrak says that in planning Le-
frak City he was aware that increased
leisure time and rising personal income
have Spurred Americans to seek diversi-
fied year-round recreation pursuits and
to look for a share of these in apartment
developments. Another factor taken in-
to account was the frustrating traffic
jams during the mass summer exodus to
the country and the beaches. “Apart-
ment house builders,” he says, “would
find it to their advantage to offer their
tenants stay-at-home recreation facili-
ties that wouid make the bumper-to-

bumper struggle unnecessary.”

Americans are now spending up-

wards of $40,000,000,000 a year on a

wide diversity of sports and recreation,

 CAM

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

according to figures from government
and private sources compiled by the In-
stitute of Life Insurance. “Since recrea-
tion is so important, we have made cer-
tain that facilities to satisfy this need
have an important place in our planned
community,” Mr. Lefrak declares. “Be-
sides, our program may save tenants
some money which they might other-
wise be spending for outside recrea-
tion.”

Lefrak City tenants have had a wide
variety of recreation features, such as
swimming races, water polo contests,
fashion shows, beauty contests, dancing
exhibitions, karate and judo demonstra-
tions, magic and puppet shows, treasure
hunts, broadcasting at pool sites by disc
jockeys, buffet suppers, and dancing to
various types of bands. The supervised
swimming pools dotting the forty-acre
site are kept open on unusually hot
evenings for both adults and children.
Others facilities in Lefrak City include
a baseball diamond and a general field
area for football and soccer, basketball
courts, teenage clubrooms, tennis courts,
golf practice greens, ice and roller skat-
ing areas, nursery and kindergarten
schools. Construction of an indoor pool,
a health club and a sauna is underway.
Eighty percent of the forty-acre site has
been reserved for gardens and recrea-
tion areas.

was E. Rivers

HE FIVE HUNDRED delegates from thirty countries
at the World Recreation Congress in Japan had
seven days filled with information, inspiration and
lowship. They included representatives from the United
ions, government officials, representatives of industry,
or, education, and a great variety of play, recreation,
l leisure-time agencies, as well as members of three royal
lilies. Men and women of many cultures, colors, reli-
.ns and economic levels were moved by a single purpose
making life more meaningful.
The setting was superb. It combined the glamorous fea-
'es of old Japan with the dynamic developments of a
lion building for the future. Messages from United Na-
rs Secretary General U Thant, President Lyndon B.
inson, H.R.H. Prince Philip, H.I.H. the Shah, and many
Iers hailed the World Recreation Congress.
Said Secretary General Thant, “Constructive and crea-
e use of leisure is becoming a world-wide influence in
'lding better understanding between peoples of different
ltural heritages. This is essential for a peaceful world
. helping to create a climate where peace can flourish.”
President Johnson wrote, “The desirable objectives of
is congress have been made known throughout the world
. it will help to promote understanding, good will, and
ace among all nations. These laudable objectives, always
rthy of emphasis, are particularly important now . . .”
ed” Kelley, the world’s best-known hockey player, now
nember of the Canadian Parliament, speaking for Cana-
n Prime Minister Lester Pearson, declared Canada’s
erest in and support of recreation for all peoples.
In six plenary sessions and thirty-one section meetings,
'ide variety of pertinent problems were discussed by 150
ogram participants, opening up the basic aspects of
y, recreation, and leisure-time services. The goals
ich bind us together were stressed throughout the week.
My keynote address, “Walking Together Into the Age
Leisure,” outlined the economic, social, and scientific
sis for the leisure age; proclaimed IRA goals as leisure
freedom for all mankind, adequate facilities, trained
dership, and a united approach to building understand-
between nations; then challenged the world recrea-
n leaders to go out from the congress “to help build to-
her a new civilization, a new kind of life for man where
quality will be determined more by his leisure than
his labor.”
Dean Scarfe of Canada, concluding a scholarly address
“Play in Education,” said: “Play is not only vital to
ildhood, but the spirit of play is vital to all humanity,
e basis of most of the happiness of mankind, the means
which humanity advances creatively, scientifically, in-
:kctually, and socially. Not only is it vital to childhood,
t the spirit of play is vital to all mankind.” This is
lininiscent of Joseph Lee, John Finley, Howard Braucher,
rd C. M. Goethe, the great pioneers in the U.S. play and
Lcreation movement, but with a difference. At no time
. history has this basic educational concept had such an
sportunity to influence human happiness. The message

was received gladly by representatives of nations in all
stages of economic, social and political deveIOpment.

The Congress Resolutions Committee, composed of dele-
gates from eight countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, North
and South America, declared continuance of the congress
“essential to the progress and unity of the world recreation
movement,” and urged each country to organize a central
national voluntary agency that would concern itself pri-
marily with play, recreation and leisure-time aspects of
life. The committee declared that leadership for the leisure
age is essential and recommended long-term professional
training and called on government and voluntary agencies
to lend their active support to a world-wide development
of national parks, reserves, and natural areas “in order to
preserve our natural heritage for man’s spiritual benefits
and physical needs.”

The tours, consultation service and exhibits were of a
high order and rounded out the total experience of the
delegates. The exhibit, “Recreation in the United States,”
was an outstanding example of cooperation on the part of
some fourteen national, state. and local recreation agencies
in the United States. It was planned, organized, and fin-
anced by a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Nor-
man P. Miller of the University of California in Los
Angeles.

Interwoven with the discussions were colorful demon-
strations of Japanese music and dances, a series of recep-
tions by mayors and governors, climaxed by an unforget-
table party given the delegates by 11.1.”. Prince Mikasa,
honorary president of the Congress, and Princess Mikasa.
These affairs exemplified the warmth and creativity of
Japanese hospitality.

I wish fervently that all who have helped or will help
to finance IRA world service could have clasped hands as
we did at the final session with men and women from six
continents and islands of the sea singing “Auld Lang Syne.”

a saltwater tidal lake connected with
the Oakland Estuary in San Francisco
Bay. The lake itself, in Lakeside Park,
is three and a quarter miles in circum-
ference and is controlled and pro-
gramed by the Oakland Recreation De-
partment. Activities on the lake include
sailing, canoeing, rowboat and electric
boat rentals, activity by the Oakland
Women’s Rowing Club, the Lake Mer-
ritt Rowing Club, and related activities.
Directly across the lake from ORD’s
offices is Fairyland, the internationally
known children’s fantasyland play area.
ORD also operates a sailboat house
adjacent to Fairyland, where the major
portion of boat rentals are made.

The offices, themselves, take up the
major portion of the main boathouse,
which is comprised of two wings which
extend out over the water and the main
body of the structure. One wing is
given over entirely to the adminstrative
ofiicers and secretarial help. The cen-
tral section of the boathouse houses the
finance and personnel sections, along
.with some program supervisors. A pro-
fessional library, meeting room, and
staff lounge complete the structure.

A number of sailboats and racing
shells are stored in the center section
to complement storage in the sailboat
house on the opposite shore. Present
plans call for for the underside of the
administrative wing to be turned over
to storage of racing shells, which get
up to sixty feet length for the eight
place boats.

Several long docks extend from the
base of the boathouse out into Lake
Merritt to accommodate the many boat-
ing activities and a mooring place for
the ninety place launches that the de-
partment operates. The tugboat Ann
and two crash boats operated by the
department also have their home base
at the main boathouse.

In the distance are the Oakland Hills,
which feature beautiful residential
areas. The boathouse has one of the
most beautiful settings for any recrea-
tion department’s central office in the
United States. It is not uncommon for
the staff to look out of the oflice win-
dows and see a fleet of sailboats going
by, wild ducks flying down the lake, and
a slight haze over the distant hills.—

rector of Program, Oakland, California.

FUNCTIONAL AND
BEAUTIFUL

THE CLASS and Bayport-limestone
recreation center and clubhouse in
C. S. Mott Park, Flint, Michigan, was
designed for maximum year-round use.
It serves as headquarters for the nine-
hole golf course located near center of
city, which is heavily used, especially
by junior golfers. It also serves balance
of park as a recreation center with rest-
rooms, lounge with TV, a first-class re-
freshment service bar with latest equip-
ment for serving sandwiches, soft
drinks, coffee and hot chocolate, short-
order foods, candy, et cetera. It is also
used for group meetings, dinners, et
cetera when not in use by public. Its
winter use is primarily for the interre-
lated winter sports facilities: ice skat-
ing, skiing, coasting, toboganning.
Some of the building’s more important
features follow:

0 The 42’-by-60’ center, designed by
Ellis, Arndt and Truesdell of Flint, has
an automatic, gas-heat system with
blowers for ventilation (can be adapted
for future air-conditioning) .

o A quarry tile floor, which is good for
golf spikes in summer, is easy to clean,
and is covered with plywood during
winter for use as an ice-skate changing
room.

0 An excellent view. The center is lo-
cated on a hillside with front entrance
leading to street level but rear of build-
ing facing park (golf course, river, and
wooded area). Has floor-to-ceiling
plate-glass tinted windows for full view.
‘0 Walls made of cast-in place Bayport
limestone (one of few buildings of this
type).

0 A four-sided, hooded fireplace in
northwest corner of lounge, a beautiful
feature, much appreciated by golfers
and winter-sports enthusiasts.

0 Extensive landscaping. The front-
street side features cut-stone walls, ter-
races, wrought-iron railings, and azal-
eas, evergreens, and ground-cover. This
was most important as the recreation
center is located in a high-income, high-
value residential area. The neighbors
were apprehensive about the building
until it was completed. Now, they are
very proud of it as a complement to

their beautiful homes-:DONALD F.

As members of the Metropolitan

u take hundreds of our students to 0p-

orks studied in great detail for many
onths in school prior to the trip. The
,. thusiasm and genuine love for this
iedium generated among these ordin-
ry, typical suburban youngsters was
ch that they formed their own opera
lubs and did all that they could to fur-
ter their appreciation of various works
i the repertoire.

I cannot recall how many times I
ave been asked by members of my
horus to allow them to perform an op-
ra. At one time I considered Mozart’s
astien et Bastienne, but even this
outhful work seemed far beyond their
bility. Finally, the idea occurred to
re one day in July of 1962 to write an
)pera which could be performed by or-
linary school children. Nine months
ater I completed The Magic Yo-Yo.

pure Rothgorber and his opera about Jimmy, a little boy who just “wasn't with it."

In three acts and taking an hour and
a half to perform, The Magic Yo-Yo has
an abundance of choral work, solos,
duets, ensemble arias, and recitative. At
the outset I was determined to relate it
to the idiom of children, their speech,
their ways of acting and reacting, and
their ways of thinking. I also tried to
start where I found the children to be;
namely, on the level of musical comedy,
and to lead them from there to a higher
plateau. Therefore, my score reflects
musical comedy, operetta, and shades
of grand opera. As for musical influ-
ences I have tried to emulate subtly,
for my students’ benefit, the styles of
Gilbert and Sullivan, Mozart, Verdi,
and \Vagner. For the musical interludes
and in the big dance sequence I have
remained pure Rothgarber whose esthe-
tic is the modern school. During the
baseball scene and in several other spots
the children sing to a contemporary dis-
sonant musical accompaniment.

The Magic Yo-I'o deals with the
events of two days in the life of young
Jimmy Jackson. a nonconfonnin", day-
dreaming, atypical lad of about ten
which cause him to take stock of him-
self, evaluate himself, and to grow.

It is the day before the big test. The
children are worried. especially about
Jimmy who just can't “get with it.”
Jimmy arrives on the scene late because
he has found something on his way to
school——a magic yo-vo. When the chil-
dren enter the building, Jimmy remains

outside to play with it, and while play-
ing a genie appears. Jimmy discovers it
is magical, and that TennyWeen), the
genie, will appear any time he plays it
three times.

The rest of the work deals with the
way in which the genie helps J itmny to
pass the test and to form a new image
of himself. I have also made a small
plea to my students to accept noncon-
formity in this work.

The Magic Yo-l'o was first performed
in June of 1963 at two PTX meetings.
It was then shown four more times to
the various school grades. From there
it was taken up by the Oceanside Rec-
reation Department under the leader-
ship of Joseph \I . Ilalper. director of
recreation. Every summer in conjunc-

summer to have my work performed
tJuly thirtiethl at \athan's and seven
other times at each of the recreation

the forty children in the r-ast performed

YOUR BAZAAR

visions of fun, gaiety, and ex-

citement. It also brings visions of
profit, since the main reason for having
a bazaar is to raise funds. Bazaars are
still one of the best ways to provide for
the sponsoring groups while giving
pleasure and value to customers. It can
be a large, elaborate affair, covering
acres and interesting the entire com-
munity, or a small sale held in a single
room and organized by and for mem-
bers and a few friends. Whatever its
size and scope, the job of producing
a bazaar is a big one and the funda-
mentals of running it remains the same.
Organization with imagination is the
key to success and although the actual
event may be months or even a year
away, it is never too early to start plan-
ning and organizing.

The first step is to set up committees.
Most operations work out best if under
the supervision of a single chairman
who will oversee all committees and co-
ordinate activities. Choose committee
chairmen for the following: publicity,
decorations, food, pricing, booths, hand-
made articles for sale, finance, and
clean-up. Each chairman then selects
his or her own committee members.

One of the most important choices is
a publicity chairman. Publicity brings
customers by inviting people to attend;
therefore, it cannot be a last-minute
effort. Your publicity campaign should
begin with announcement of the selec-
tion of committees and should gain
momentum, hitting its peak immediate-
ly before the bazaar opens. Publicity
includes newspapers, radio and TV sta-
tions, posters, letters of invitation to
other organizations, and any other

essential to a successful bazaar, without
a large outlay of funds? The answer is

and gay lapel pins with just a little

color! Color lifts spirits, transforms
ordinary into beautiful, provides the
carnival, fairy-tale atmosphere that
makes your bazaar an exciting, be-
dazzling marketplace.

It is easy to put color into your
bazaar. Consider a few simple possibil-
ities: hanging mobiles, balloons, skirts
or tent coverings for booths, streamers,
even party aprons or hair bows for
salespeople to make them easily identifi-
able. Booths usually are simple affairs
consisting of large tables with or with-
out uprights and canopy. Uprights can
be anything from broomstick handles
to sturdy wooden beams. Brightly dyed
sheets, tablecloths, or nylon parachutes
can be tacked atop for a colorful awn-
ing, used for a skirt around the table, or
striped and wrapped gaily around poles
or used as a trellis effect.

The heart of your bazaar will be the
selling of handmade articles. These are

 

the biggest moneymakers, since In
rials and labor are usually donated
club members, and items can be sol
a complete profit. Assess the we
and tastes of your community be
you begin to solicit any items; for, I
in any kind of business, it pays to k
your market.

Bazaar chairmen agree that the po
lar price range is $ .25 to $3.00, .
popular items are eyecatching, colo
versions of everyday things. Ther
also a demand for unusual novel it
like wall hangings, trivets, quill p
or a unique topiary tree.

Many charming items can be “m
produced” by a relatively small gr
in an afternoon or evening, if all
materials and equipment needed are
hand. Have someone demonstrate h
to make a basic item and encour
everyone to finish and decorate in
own fashion. Even “assembly-l
items” emerge with individual desi
and personalities. An added divid
is that so-called “no-talent” people s
denly find that they do, indeed, hav
talent for creating and designing be
tiful and useful items. These could

OR A recreation arts-and-crafts program to succeed, it
must differ from the school’s program. It can best do
this by offering the child a freedom of choice, expres-

n, and movement. This can only be made possible by a

d deal of planning and a system of organization that is

A regimented.

During an eight-week recreation arts-and-crafts program

r primary children, I presented over fifty ideas, with the

oper materials, with which the children could work. My

ogram was set up in such a way that each child could
oose from a variety of at least six activities weekly: one
aft project, one piece of sculpture, two interesting art

Irms, and two among various drawing medias such as India

bk, charcoal, colored chalk, and so on. The crafts projects

Ioluded such items as balsa wood airplanes, leather wallets,

ad hammered bracelets. Sculpture pieces were made from

led, steel wool, tinfoil, sawdust, gummed paper, and wood.
lie art forms included stenciling, printing, string painting,

I-arbleizing, tie and dye, and collages.

A notice was sent home with the children after the first
cek of the program, explaining the objectives and listing
IC activities for the following week. These weekly notices
antinued and kept the parents informed, helped to get ma-
ltials from home, and also were good as far as public re-
Lions was concerncd.

It was necessary to have the assistance of a few volunteers
lways. Each volunteer would pick one of the projects and
by with it, for the entire period, to help any interested
Eildren. Volunteers were also greatly needed in the setting-
p process as each table had to be completely supplied by
be time the children arrived—so that, as soon as a brief ex-

planation of each project had been given, along with show-
ing a sample of it, the child was ready to begin. In this way
he need waste no time in selecting the table that interested
him most. The child would stay at this table until his project
was complete, and then would be free to choose his remain-
ing projects from the other tables at work around him. Some
childrizn can complete as many as four activities in an hour;
others may do only one. It makes no diflerence as long as
the child is actively pursuing an artistic achievement. We
always tried to keep back materials available so if a child
wanted to make something from another week's lesson, he
was welcome to do so. There was a box of assorted materials
always handy for people who wanted to try out an idea not
featured in the program itself.

THE SAMPLES made to stimulate the children‘s interest

were not left in view to be copied, but were put aside
to be exhibited on the final work session of the program.
Children were also requested to bring back some of their
work to put on display. The highlight of the final session
was not thc display, but the invitation to the parents to par-
ticipate in an actual work session. These parents were not
to come and observe, but to put on their old clothes and
actually work with the children. Then, their work was
framed like that of the children, given a title, labeled, and
shown to the group for approval.

With this type of program, children wait eagerly to par-
ticipate, give any type of project a try, work independently:
but, mostly, they gain a feeling of satisfaction from con-
quering some artistic skills that before had been taught in
a strait jacket and did not take their personalities into con-
sideration. To some, this brings a sense of amazement; for,
as one youngster so aptly put it. “What. a recreation pro-
gram—with no potholders. lanyards. or baskets! I can’t

believe it.” #

The FAMILY and the COMMUNITY

We face increased possibilities and responsibilities

for wise use of leisure time

A. F Wileden

0 NE MAJOR REA-
SON why the
community ap-
proach to family
recreation is so im-

portant today is be-
cause the family as

 

a social group is
frequently failing to meet this need
Within the family circle. Either because
of a lack of concern or of inability to
cope with the situation, the family, in-
cluding the rural family, is letting the
forces of our time bore in upon it and
undermine its effectiveness. This has
resulted in the lessening of the family
as a vitally functioning social group un-
til the point is reached where the family
group itself, or some agency that is con-
cerned with the family, turns to the com-
munity or some group within the com-
munity to take up where the family is
failing.

Some people think the church should
do this, others look to the school, some
to certain special interest organizations
such as YMCA or Scouts or 4H clubs,
and others turn to specially created gov-
ernment departments or agencies. No
one of these can do the task; what is
needed is to alert them to the oppor-
tunity before them and, at the same
time, bring them all together in terms of
a comprehensive program of service
both to individuals and to families.

The function of the community in our
society, however you define it, is to
serve people. Communities as a social
system have developed as a functional
aspect of our system of social organiza-
tion and will persist only as long as they
help people to meet basic needs and de-
sires. The use of our increasing leisure
is one of these areas of desires and

needs and one aspect of community de-
velopment is concerned with these de-
sires and needs. However, the field of
recreation, and the facilities and serv-
ices that contribute to it, are exceeding-
ly and increasingly complex. Up to this
point we have thought of the use of
leisure from the point of view of the
consumer, the person with nonwork
time on his hands and a desire to make
a best use of it. We have been thinking
about activities and programs including
what might be considered as physical,
social, or cultural in nature that can
contribute to one’s personal satisfaction
and well being. We have been thinking
in terms of the potential contribution to
personal needs of both public agencies
and of private organizations and of the
uniting of the efforts of those two sets
of forces in terms of a planned and bal-
anced program to people and to fami-
lies.

TODAY, the community has even an-
other duty to perform; that is to
view recreation as a resource and de-
ve10p and preserve this resource in a
way that it can be most useful and most
satisfying to people. This involves an-
other whole group of specialized and
highly trained professional people: Our
planners and developers who must study
land from the point of view of its best
uses and see that suitable areas are set
aside (zoned, if you please) for devel-
opment of parks, playgrounds, shooting
preserves, lakes, streams, and forested
areas for public use. Then, there are the
people whose task it is to develop these
areas—plant or protect the trees and

cepts. His name is imprinted on the stationery. The only
good accruing is the personal publicity obtained from the
listing. Power structure or not, we need some Indians along
with the chiefs. The chief who doesn’t hold up his own
weight really isn’t much good to an organization.

Mrs. Green is willing to do anything, but her potential is
limited. Her sister, Mrs. Emerald does what she wants to
do very well, but cools off quickly when details come up that
bore her.

\Vhat do you recall about Miss Lavender who says, “This
is fine, but girls, we should have done it this other way"?
She uses hindsight instead of foresight.

Mrs. Oxblood knows just how the agency should be run
and probably tries to do it. Mr. Turquoise and Mrs. Au-
burn procrastinate until both the board chairman and the
executive get ulcers. In the end they may get the ob (lone
creditably, or perhaps someone else has to be called in at
the last minute to finish the job on a crash basis.

Then, there is the board member we are all looking for,
the “perfect jewel,” probably the busiest person on the
board, who never misses a meeting, accepts assignments, and
carries them through with a minimum of direction. \Ve all
have some board members like that, even though they are

hard to find.

WE MAY GRIPE about our boards but are we really being
fair to them, all the varied shades of them? Are they
being used to the limits of their capacity? Do we spend
enough time looking for their hidden capacities, the talents
that may not show on the surface? Are we really “combing
the woods” for new talent? Once appointed, has our ori-
entation been suilicient to develop interest and maintain it?
One board decided it wanted to involve some of the young.
er members of the organization in responsible committee
positions. It found that they were enthusiastic, had some
ready-made talents, and that they had previously been timid
about pushing themselves forward for fear that they might

be misunderstood.
lt is also important to retain the interest of persons who

 

have served on the board, and who, for one reason, or an-
other are no longer on it. Some organizations have the pol-
icy of “striking” out a member after he has served as pres-
ident or chairman. On the day he relinquishes office, every-
one sighs, “What are we going to do without you?” Then
it may be ten years before he is asked to serve again. “Re-
tired” board members are often particularly valuable to in-
volve at the beginning of the year orientation sessions for
new members.

When new board members are added, particularly when
several take office at the same time, at least one full meeting
should be devoted to orientation. This will save time later
for other important business. The orientation offers oppor-
tunity for staff and seasoned board members to get acquaint-
ed. New members can ask questions; older ones can supply
information about board jobs and the policies of the organ-
ization.

Each new board member should be given a written “job”
description. In this way, he can learn what is expected of
him. He should be supplied with “historical records,” ac-
counts of what happened in previous years which give new
members background and helping them to see their duties
as part of an on-going organizational pattern. Supplying
records should be part of the responsibility of each board
member. When a term is finished, every member should
provide the agency or organization with a written record
of what happened during his term, to be passed on to his suc-
cessor. He should also return the materials inherited from
his predecessor.

Another helpful form of record keeping is the “policy
sheet.” These are written statements of policy decisions that
are expected to be used as blueprints for action for some
time to come. They may amplify constitution and bylaws, or
the policy may be the result of board action which otherwise
would be buried in minutes. How many times have you
heard someone say, “I know we decided to do this. It must
be in the minutes some place, but, for the life of me, I can’t
locate it.”

BOARD PERSONNEL are not usually professionally trained.

They are busy at other tasks for a livelihood. They do
not have time to devote more than a few hours each month
to their board duties. Therefore, they should not assume
administrative responsibilities, either separately or collec-
tively. No professional administrator worth his salt can op-
erate efficiently under conditions where one, two, or every
member of a board is trying to tell him what to do. Too
many hands on the rudder can sink the ship.

The administrator should not dictate to his board on pol-
icy matters. He should be available if asked, sensitive to
board wishes, have a working relationship with each mem-
ber so that matters can be discussed intelligently. When
such rapport has been established between an administrator
who knows his business and a board that knows its place,
everyone benefits.

In many agencies, board members do wear two hats. One
hat is for board or committee activities. The other is worn
when the board member performs volunteer service in the
agency. Duties may range anywhere—licking stamps to

34

 
  
  
 
 
   
  
    
  
   
  
   
   
 
   
   

teaching craft classes, keeping books, to answerin
phone.

Staff procedures need to be clearly defined and unders
both by the volunteer and paid staff. The best relatio
sults when it is understood that the volunteer working i
agency accepts supervision from the staff director or
member directly in charge of the activity. No board
ber should regard himself or be regarded as the “
when he comes to work.

Another thing important to efficient board functioni
operation on a business-like basis. This means holding
ularly scheduled meetings at regularly scheduled place
ing a prearranged agenda. New and controversial ma
not on the agenda should be deferred until proper stu
made. If possible, regular board meetings should be ac
plished in a definitely stated span of time, so that me
will know approximately how many hours they must s
Special meetings, when needed, should also be conduct
a similar manner.

Individual board members should not only be willi
devote time to regular meetings, they should also be wi
to carry out efficiently committee or elective office as
ments. Each one should, if the time comes, be willin
accept chairmanship of the board. Part of the chairm
efficiency comes from his or her familiarity with action
has taken place previously, with reminders from the
of complete written records mentioned earlier. It is
true that some of this efficiency comes from “osmosis,” f
knowing circumstances surrounding certain actions, f I
acquaintance with the personalities with whom the chair
has been associated on the board. After working with u
ple in these relationships for a time, it is usually easie
assess the potential of other members for the particular j
to be done.

1

WE ALSO CONFRONT the current tendency to appoin

elect large unwieldy boards without compensating
ner organization to get the jobs done. A small group, s
as an executive committee, should have authority to act
certain matters between board meetings. Likewise, pro
committees can be appointed. These can be dissolved w
the assignment is completed. This is better practice than a
celing out a variety of tasks as busy work for many sta
ing committees. The more members, the less individual
sponsibility each one takes on a board. Absenteeism ta
its toll; often inertia results.

The administrator is the “go-between” from board
staff. Except where specifically requested by the admi
trator, no staff member should go directly to a board m
ber. Likewise, the board member should respect the auth
ty of the administrator by not contacting a staff mem
directly. Staff members should recognize the chain of c
mand, which, by the way, should be clearly defined, in
official chart of organization understood by all.

ECREATION executives and policy-makers talk a good
R deal about the incredible amounts of free time our
citizens have and will have; the challenge of this
free time; and the need for dynamic new concepts to help
people make the best use of it. But how many people, even
the community leaders you see every day, truly understand
the problem and its many ramifications? How many have
truly faced up to implications of leisure in the lives of
retired men and women; of boys growing up to jobs that
will inevitably provide shorter and shorter hours of work
and more and more time 05; of a society that could find in
boredom the urge to self—destruction?

If our communities are ever to plan intelligently for
these and other problems, there must be far wider under-
standing of what they are and far greater agreement on
what should be done not just by so-called “recreation
agencies,” but by all groups that affect our society, includ-
ing the church, business, the schools, and the many social
planning and social service groups.

Believing this, the National Recreation Association un-
dertook to develop, with a committee of the National Social
Welfare Assembly, a program for discussion of the impact
of increasing leisure. An all-day workshop held in New
York at the otiiees of the assembly was attended by repre-
sentatives of thirty national organizations as well as near-
by local groups. The findings of the workshop were made
available to a number of community planning councils
that had agreed to discum them in the light of their own
local situation.

The reports of these discussions, in turn, were digested
and have now been made the basis of a series of questions
for discussion which can be used by community groups.
Analysis revealed that a hrst discussion gets people to

2. Concerning young people who do not avail themselves
of agency services—are they “hard-to-reach'1 or are the
agencies “hard-to-reach” ?

3. Where should program take place in order to reach
groups that traditionally do not seek out agency services?

4. How about a community-service center (representing
all kinds of services) to assist pe0ple in locating agencies
and to find people who need help? Is this the kind of
vehicle that would help people find their way—mo matter
how young, old, handicapped. deprived? Is the elementary-
school facility an appropriate location?

5. Why not, on a community basis (accepting our vari-
ous resistances and lack of know-how) , consider bringing
community senices to where people go for other services—
the grocery store. barbershOp, beer. laundry. library. medi-
cal doctor, eliminating all hurdles in the path to community
service? (The mobility of people, the multiplicity of serv-
ices and complexity of needs require statesmanship of a
new order.)

6. Shouldn't agencies. and communities, do more to
speed up their reaction to changing situation. (specially
rapid changes brought about by automation and job shifts?

7. Are public and private agencies geared to handle the
problem inherent in the changing situation of increased
available time for leisure use?

8. If public and private agencies cannot meet the new
free-time needs. do we need an entirely new group of agen-
cies to do this?

9. Could total community planning meet recreation
needs in use of free time? Could present services meet the
needs if they were coordinated on a community level or

would more still be needed?

WHEN TAKING a long-range look at the recreation field

of the future, one cannot fail to recognize the grow-

ing opportunities and need for more and more
trained female personnel in this comparatively new profes-
sion. Automation, the shorter workweek, and longer life
span are contributing to wider horizons for free-time ac-
tivities than ever before imagined in the history of our
country. New fields are developing and old ones are growing
which are opening more and larger doors to qualified wo-
men who can get the jobs done and want to give s'ervice.

Women in recreation operate in many types of settings.

The field has many facets; however, the demand for women
is greater in some areas of specialization and in certain sec-
tions of the country than in others. Listed below are some
of the doors which are open to qualified female recreators:
Public Recreation. Today, there is hardly a community,
regardless of size, which does not have a recreation program
in some form. Opportunities for women are many and var-
ied. They range from playground leaders to heads of de-
partments. Program supervisors and directors of recreation
centers are in demand. Newly organized programs for sen-
ior citizens and the handicapped require recreation special-
ists with patience and a love for people. Women are ideally
suited for this kind of work.
lndustrial Recreation. Industry, recognizing a definite need
for the morale and welfare of its employes, along with im-
proving their working conditions, has begun to build rec-
reation programs. These programs reach far beyond the nar-
row conhnesrof the “oldlook recreation,” which consisted
largely of a baseball or softball team. As a result, more and
more women are being hired to plan and supervise a va-
riety of recreation activities designed to catch and hold the
interest of all employes and their families.
Commercial Recreation. Although motivated by opportunity
to make a profit, without which it would not exist, com-
mercial recreation constitutes a well-known pattern of or-
ganized recreation within the United States. Professional

sports, movies, theater, radio, television, travel, ent
ment, and amusement in hundreds of forms are amo
most widespread types of commercial enterprise. Qu
women with recreation backgrounds are needed to
as commentators, plan related programs, arrange
serve as social directors in hotels and on passenger
direct plays and other entertainment activities.
Rural Recreation. Long recognized as an essential p
American life, recreation in rural areas is growing in
and bounds. Extension work, 4H clubs, the grange
other groups are leading the way in this important l
of recreation. More and more women recreation 1e
are required to plan and direct these activities.

Church Recreation. Church and synagogue recreati
growing beyond the concept of Sunday evening social
church picnics. Churches of all denominations are t
ing in terms of making religion a real force in the eve
life of the youth of our nation. One way of doing this
make the parish house a real community center all (1
the week and not just on Sundays. Women recreation
ers are ideal for this kind of work.

Institutional Recreation. Schools and colleges, orphan
and prisons are using recreation as a tool in the form
of character. Modern education has combined the
of teaching knowledge with the role of teaching people
to live. Opportunities for professional female leadersh
these specialized fields are increasing rapidly.

Hospital Recreation. Recreation for patients, origi
considered largely in terms of helping to pass long h
of idleness enforced by illness, now has become an int
part of hospital care. Although much of this work
done by the Red Cross during war years, the various
tary services now have established civilian therapy 0
military hospitals. The plan has spread to veterans, s
municipal, and private hospitals. Recreation therapy is
a recognized part of medical treatment requiring not n
recreation skills, but also more specific training in the
of such skills in proper relation to medical treatment. S
the female temperament is ideally suited to this kin
work, women are in great demand for such positions.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR
PROGRAM PLANNING

Intelligent program planning
gives the best possible variety

of opportunity for the money available

Reynold E. Carlson, Theodore R. Deppe, and Janet R. MocLeon

have evolved from the experience of leaders through
the years? Principles of program planning that
community leaders might consider are here summarized:
1. The recreation program should attempt to meet
the individual and group needs and desires of the
people. The final test of success or failure in a program
will lie in its ability to satisfy the people for whom the
program was planned. If needs are not met, desires not
fulfilled, the participants feel no inclination to return to the
program.
Basic psychological needs are universal. Each individual
seeks new experience, recognition, security, response, a

feeling of belonging, or a search for esthetic rewards. Indi-
viduals find satisfactions for these universal desires in a
variety of ways. A game of chess may satisfy an old man’s
wish to relate to others, whereas the teenager may appease
the same desire by attending a party or a dance. The adult
may find esthetic expression in the symphony concert, where-
as the nursery tot creates through his finger painting. In a
world in which it becomes increasingly difficult to find
satisfactions in the work day, it is the responsibility of the
recreation program to gratify expressed needs, stimulate
new interests, and develop skills to explore those interests in
alignment with the total objectives of the sponsoring agency.

2. The program should he diversified. All too often,
recreation connotes only sports and games. The effective
community program must include: sports and games; arts
and crafts; dramatic activities; music; dance; literary,
mental, and linguistic outlets; service to others; social rec-
reation; camping and outdoor recreation; hobbies; and
special events.

The program should be in careful balance to include op-
portunities for: active and passive recreation physical, so-

cial, cultural, and creative activities; programs that all
individuals with varying degrees of skill to participate; p
grams that allow progress in proficiency within the activi I
indoor and outdoor interests; activities for individual aq
for group participation; and interests that involve lorl
range as well as short-term participation.

 

3. The program should provide equal opportunii
for all, regardless of race, creed, social status, ecr
nomic needs, sex, age, interest, or mental or physio;
capacity. Although it is often expedient to run progra-
on the basis of the “greatest good for the greatest numbeil
wise program planning for community recreation will if
clude activities for all ages, f0r both sexes, and for grou]
with special interest, varying ability, or economic, gq
graphic, or social problems.

AGE. Program opportunities must not be limited to a1
one age grouping. Some programs should be provided esp!
cially for youngsters, teenagers, adults, or the aged; 0th!
programs should attract mixed age groups by cross-cuttin
the interests of entire families or other social units. Tl'
young adults and adults are all too frequently ignored i
favor of an accent on youth needs.

SEX. Opportunities should be offered in equal balance I
meet the needs and interests of each sex. Other prograrr
should seek to offer wholesome outlets for co-recreation z
many ages.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. Community recreatio
should not be apportioned according to one’s ability to paj
nor should the recreation program be dedicated to the need
of only the lower social or economic strata. Recreation mu:
service basic recreation outlets for rich and poor alike.

MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPACITY. Communities 3]

ClAL-INTEREST GROUPS. Although leadership and
ties are sometimes hard to find in the daily program
those who would like to indulge in sculpture, sailing,
osing symphonies, or discussing philosophies, the skill-
rogram planner will make every attempt to create out-

‘for those special interests through specialists, hobby
, classes, or volunteer leaders.

CE, CREED, OR ETHNIC GROUPS. It seems superfluous

ntion that any program organized on democratic prin-
will avoid prejudices for or against racial or religious
ps. Racial discrimination is one of the basic issues that
tion administrators, along with other community lead-
must face. Too often, program planning ignores par-
r needs of ethnic groups in special neighborhoods.
Programs should be offered at a wide variety
mes to meet the diverse living schedules of the
lation. Timing is important to the success of any
ram. Activities must be available during the times
I people are free to participate. Too frequently, the
ing hours, the weekends, and the winter months are
looked, as program emphasis is geared too strongly to
of children or working adults. Although there is a cred-
endency to avoid interference with church services on
ay, many agencies also close their doors on Saturday,
y when families might best avail themselves of com-
'ty offerings.

e center that operates only in the afternoon and evening
ts the early rising aged, who often do not care to travel
ght. The playground that operates adult programs only
e evening ignores the many workers who labor on the
shift.

. Recreation programs for the community should
med and coordinated to make best use of com.
ity facilities and personnel resources. No one
nization in the community is capable of satisfying all
leisure needs and interests of the people. It is important
' there be cooperative planning and coordination among
° iduals or agencies that offer recreation programs so
intelligent use can be made of existing facilities, lead-
'p, and finance. For example, youth agencies frequently
churches, schools, and city recreation facilities for their
rams. Inservice training institutes should utilize cap-
leaders from all community agencies. Efficient cooper-
" will prevent needless duplication of programs or facili-
or will fill voids in these areas. Involvement of partici-

and leaders in planning will also aid in successful
raining.

. Quality leadership must be employed as the
bone of successful recreation: offerings. The cap-
ties of the leaders will make or break the programs.
'mum recreation outlets are possible only when qualified.
essional leaders are employed and given authority par-
with their responsibilities.

. Adequate financial backing is necessary, if pro-
us are to succeed. Intelligent program planning

order that equal access for participation is possible.
r activities may be properly financed by fees and

UARY, 1965

charges. Creative planning, careful coordination and intelli-
gent evaluation will produce the maximum in recreation
benefits for the number of dollars expended.

8. Best practices to insure the safety and health of
the participants must be employed. There is an ever-
increasing emphasis on the responsibility of the sponsoring
organization for insuring adequately safe and healthful con-
ditions for those who are participating in recreation. Albert
Whitney (in Family Recreation and Safety, Vere York U ni-
versity Center for Safely Education) comments on the. rela-
tion between safety and recreation as follows:

“Teach a boy to play football safely, or to sail a boat
safely, or to use a gun safely; in each case, you are showing
him how he can have a good adventure instead of a bad one.
Instead of the bad adventure of breaking his collarbone, he
can have the good adventure of carrying the ball across the
goal line; instead of the bad adventure of tipping his boat
over . . . he can have the good adventure of sailing on to a
thrilling finish; instead of ending his hunting adventure

with a bullet through his leg, he can have the better adven-
ture of the chase. . . .

“From this point of view, the relation between safety and
recreation is immediately clear. Safety rids us of the bad
adventure and opens the way for the good adventure, but
it remains for recreation actually to bring the good adven-
ture. We must not put the children off the streets (for play-
ing in the streets is better than no playing at all) , unless we
can furnish them with other, safe places in which to play.
The two movements must go hand in hand. The safety move-
ment needs the recreation movement in order to supply the
better adventure. The recreation movement needs the safety
movement in order to free life for the better adventure. They
are both bound together as inseparable parts of the [110“:-

ment for a richer, better, more spiritual, more truly adven-
turous life.”

For safer program efforts constant research must be made
on accidents and their causes. Leaders must be constantly
alerted to the difficulties of unhealthful or unsanitary prac-
tices whether they be found in continuing physical activity
in the face of participant fatigue, unsanitary facilities. debris
on playground, or easy accessibility of acids in the craft
center.

9. Program planning should adhere to the best
available standards as evolved by national leaders.
Many agencies and organizations have developed standards
for facilities. leadership, or program. Conscientious pro-
gram planners will utilize the standards put forth by such
organizations as the American Camping Amociation. Na-

tional Recreation Association, American Red Cross, or the
Division of Cirls’ and Women’s Sports of the AAIII’I'IR.

10. Programs should be constantly re-evalnated in
light of objectives and public acceptance. Surveys to
investigate and to promote recreation activities. continuous
evaluation of existing programs. and planned observations
of response to new offerings should guide program efforts.
Constant awareness of changes in interest and needs will
avoid wasting budget money on activities that have outlived
their appeal. #

0 ON THE SURFACE. Five products for sealing and repairing
blacktop surfaces constitute a complete maintenance pro-
gram designed for industrial, commercial, and institutional
use. These products are:
Greeskut, a dry powder which cuts grease and oil slick
quickly and easily.
Kold Seal, a rubberized elastic sealing compound in emul-
sion form for filling cracks and expansion joints. It is poured
cold just as it comes from the container. It furnishes an
elastic filler that “gives,” with expansion or contraction or
under heavy loads, thus sealing out dirt, water, and air.
Pave-O, a patching material for chuck holes that is easily
applied by unskilled labor on wet, cold surfaces in any
weather. Pave-0 is merely shoveled into the hole and is then
tamped down.
Goodyear Petroseal, a tar base emulsion recommended
as a finish coat on exterior blacktop surfaces subjected to
petroleum spillage. It is applied by brush, squeegee, or spray
over surface that has been cleaned with Greeskut and after
preparatory repairs have been made with Kold Seal and
Pave-0.
Black Kote does the same job as Petroseal but does not
protect against gasoline spillage. It is a gilsonite base sealer
which dries quickly to a jet black gloss finish and, like
Petroseal, is easy to apply by brush, squeegee, or spray.

Nature's awn. Stone is the most logical and
appropriate of all landscaping materials.
Whether it is used for a retaining wall, patio
floor, pathway, barbecue, or any number of
other possibilities, stone provides color, texture,
and pattern that are essential to every well-
conceived garden and outdoor design. The
wide color range of sandstone, quartzite, gran-
Ite, marble, limestone, and slate and the extra-
ordinary textures now available—thanks to
new methods of quarrying and cutting—ore
beauty factors of importance. In addition, the
rugged adaptability of these natural varieties
of stone-—both alone and in combination with
other materials—is being demonstrated anew
by today's architects. Walls, Breploces, and
floors of natural stone provide a dramatic
counterbalance for the sleek, trim lines of mod-
ern furniture. Ruggedly handsome with a warm
texture, stone adds an extra premium of luxury
to any interior. For free information about the
different types of stone and colors available,
write to the Building Stone Institute, 420 lex-
ington Avenue, New York City.

Boating facilities. The fourth edition of the Out-
board Boating Club Directory of Architects and
Engineers contains a listing of consulting firms
offering engineering and/or architectural serv-
ices for the deveIOpment of recreational boating
focilities and is an attempt to acquaint those
interested in developing booting facilities with
those who have the technical know-how and ex-
perience. It lists 133 different engineering con-
sulting firms in the recreational booting facili-
ties field, with 188 principal and branch offices
in 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, Canada, and the Bahamas. The Directory
is available as a free public information service
to anyone who is interested in the construction
of boating facilities and in need of the advice
of an experienced and qUoIified architect or en-
gineer. For a copy, write to Outboard Booting
Club of America, 307 North Michigan Avenue.

compaction, which will result in a
“washboard effect” and frequent resur-
facing.

Curbing Materials. Used for control
of traflic, drainage and runoff; also for
protection of building, grounds fea-
tures, and road edges. Granite is most
indestructible material. It requires no
maintenance or replacement, and it can
be picked up and moved at any time for
road widening, et cetera. Other mate-
rials used with some degree of success
are concrete and blacktop, which are
more subject to weathering and me-
chanical damage.

Sidewalk Materials. Concrete is most
acceptable, with blacktop (bituminous
asphalt) the next choice. It is ideal in
the more formal areas near structures.
Blacktop (bituminous macadam) lends
itself to the more informal character of
the naturalistic parts of the park. In
snow regions, a silicone coating should
be used on concrete to protect against
salt deterioration. Blacktop is easier to
install and its flexibility makes it less
subject to temperature changes. It re-
quires a well-constructed base and
should be bound by a metal edge. Seal-
ers will also prolong the life of blacktOp.

Retaining Walls (used to reduce
steep grades). Poured concrete wall
with stone or brick veneer should re-
quire next to no care because it com-
bines sturdiness of concrete with the
durability of a brick or stone surface.
Drains or “weeps” should be provided
through wall to prevent buildup of wa-
ter pressure and subsequent buckling.
Special attention must also he paid to
proper installation of expansion joints
to allow for movement in the concrete
due to temperature changes. Plain
concrete wall is the next alternate for
retaining walls, but will be subject to
surface deterioration. Concrete block,
if tastefully installed, can also provide
a neat, tailored appearance with little
maintenance. Dry walls (stone walls
without mortar) and cribbed walls are

not recommended for minimum main-
tenance. If dry walls are used, the in-
dividual stone must be massive enough
to prevent the removal of the individual
stones by vandals. The voids in cribbed
walls are always subject to the devel-
opment of weed growth.

Exterior Steps. Should be eliminated
where possible, but if required, they
should be less steep than indoor steps
and more carefully constructed. Stone
is the unanimous choice. It has a better
nonskid surface, and can withstand
damage from elements and winter salt.

Handrails. Should be required along-
side all exterior steps, but can be a
major maintenance problem requiring
frequent care and painting. The best
material is anodized aluminum which
requires no painting and, unlike regular
aluminum, resists corrosion.

Fence Materials. Aluminum chain
link fencing requires no painting or
other maintenance. Steel link fence re-
quires frequent painting. Protective
coatings add to their practicability, but
this can wear off, requiring eventual
painting.

Exterior Lighting Materials. F ix-
tures should be considered that require
no painting or time consuming light
replacement. Aluminum jixtures are
now used so extensively that their initial
cost is competing favorably with steel
poles; but, unlike steel, they require no
painting.

Play Area Materials. The best ma-
terials for informal play areas would
be the new resilient composition mate-
rials, with blacktop a second choice.
Because of the expense of the composi-
tion materials, an effective compromise
is blacktop over most of the area, with
the composition materials used at points
of concentrated activity (under play
apparatus).

Although stone and turf are in com-
mon use for play areas, both present
major maintenance problems. While
the resilient compounds are best, an ex-
cellent, less expensive second choice for
formal play areas is blacktop. New
colored sealers for blacktop not only
protect the surface, but also reduce the
heat absorption qualities, provide bet-
ter visibility and are more pleasing to
the eye.

The Life You Save

OK, fisherman, so you can swim, but
for safety’s sake—and just in case
your boat gets boarded by the Coast
Guard—you had better make sure that
you have at least one approved life
preserver aboard for each passenger
and crew member. The New Fisher-
man’s Encyclopedia (Stackpole Books)
lists three approved types: jackets or
vests fitted with pads of kapok, plastic
foam, or fibrous glass in a cloth or
vinyl plastic-dipped covering; buoyant

cushions; or ring buoys. Approved
equipment carries a white tab or a
stamping indicating the approval of 8

IN MEMORIAM

 

- WILLIAM C. MILLER died in St.
Cloud, Minnesota, in November at the
age of sixty-three. He had been a rec-
reation craft specialist with the St.
Cloud Recreation Department since N o-
vember 1949. Bill Miller has been cred-
ited as the originator of the “craft
mobile” and his novel ideas for craft
projects were always one of the high-
lights of the leadership training ses-
sions in St. Cloud and the National
Recreation Association Leadership In-
stitutes conducted there.

0 WILLIAM E. COLBY died in Big Sur,
California, on November 9. He would
have been ninety next May 28. He had

served as honorary president of the

to that office after retiring from the
board of directors, on which he had
served for forty-nine years, forty-seven
of them as secretary and two as presi-
dent. He was associated with John Muir
in the club’s early years, especially in
the campaigns to make Yosemite Valley
part of Yosemite National Park and to

try to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from
inundation. With Muir he founded the

club’s High Trip in 1901. He contrib-
uted substantially to the saving of the
redwoods, to enlarging Sequoia and
establishing Kings Canyon and Olympic
National Parks. He was also first chair-
man of the California State Park Com-
mission. His eminence as a mining
attorney served him well in his conser-
vation work, and he more than anyone
else carried the torch Muir laid down

when he died in late 1914.

o DONALD B. DYER, assistant superin-
tendent of the Milwaukee public schools
in charge of the municipal recreation
and adult education division, died in
November at the age of sixty-six. Mr.
Dyer joined the division in 1927 as a
social center director, became a staff
supervisor in 1928, was appointed first
assistant director in 1941, and became
director in 1948. Under his direction,
the recreation division expanded its
programs which previously had been
aimed primarily at children. A strong
advocate of the professional approach
in recreation, Mr. Dyer wrote in a 1954

report, “The hesitancy on the pa
Sierra Club from 1950, being elected many recreation people to accep

reation as an educational process
programs to be organized and cond
according to sound educational p
ples and procedures is one of the

blocks in the development of the

fession.”

available under the following options: arts and crafts,
drama, music, radio, television, roving leadership, social ac-

AS MAY BE SEEN from the above, something is happen
in recreation which makes it worth considering
women, as a vocation as well as a calling. There are m
cogent appeals other than the appeal of altruism. In plann
a career in recreation, it behooves all women, as mem
of the profession, not to limit the s00pe of their activi
to a point where they are unable to adjust, or qualify,

another type recreation. They must strive to achieve a br
background which will enable them to see and fit into

are the product of Mr. Ekbo’s fertile
imagination. He is an important influ-
ence on many of our best practicing
landscape architects today. His work,
as well as the work of his contemporar-
ies, illustrates a new and exciting land-
planning direction in our country.

His book is directed to community
leaders and administrators in whose
hands rests the fate of whatever pro-
grams are effectuated for open land
use and outdoor recreation services.
Park and recreation administrators and
workers head his list of those who must
assume responsibility for establishing
a climate of understanding within com-
munities. Much can be done to offset
the visual and functional blight of our
urban centers and provide useful out-
door recreation areas in the doing. It
takes technicians, inspired creative peo-
ple, and determined leadership.

Any serious professional recreation
administrator should know how and
what it is about the design of recrea-
tion spaces in the city that makes them
rewardingly useful to those who live
with them from day to day and year
to year. Mr. Ekbo’s book will help arm
the recreation worker for his continued
battle for budget, space, and recogni-
tion of his role in the community.—

Philosophical Foundations for Physi-
cal, Health and Recreation Education,
Earle F. Zeigler. Prentice-Hall, Engle-
wood Cliffs, New Jersey. Pp. 356.
$6.95.

EARLE ZEICLER, professor of physical
education at the University of Illi-
nois, has undertaken an ambitious as-
signment in attempting to provide the
major student in the area of health,
physical education, and recreation ed-
ucation with philosophical understand-
ing that will undcrgird professional
practice. Dr. Zeigler does a commend-
able job of developing a capsule his-
tory of the mainstreams of phiIOSOphi-
cal thought and of applying three
modern systems (“experimentalism,”
“realism,” and “idealism”) to prob-
lems related to education.

The trouble is that he never really
tells us what he means by “recreation
education.” It does not appear to in-
volve the preparation of professional

workers in this field. If it is synony-
mous with the “leisure education” func-
tion of the schools, this is not, by and
large, a clearly identified area of in-
struction; nor is it solely a matter of
carryover of physical learnings. Physi-
cal education is the primary focus of
the text, and the reader whose primary
interest is recreation will get only oc-
casional satisfaction from the author’s
brief discussions of leisure and its at-
tendant problems.

While the book, overall, is scholarly
in its use of a wide variety of references
and in the clarity of its organization
and writing, Dr. Zeigler offers in con-
clusion a chapter and several appen-
dices on another level: “Building Your
Own Personal Philosophy,” “Debating
Procedures,” and “Several Recom-
mended Types of Examinations and
Term Papers.” These seem to repre-
sent an attempt to make the text practi-
cal, rather than theoretical. However,
they seem somehow irrelevant to the
main focus and, in any case, cannot
compensate the potential reader whose
concern is chiefly recreation for the
book’s lack of a thorough and system-
atic attempt to develop a philosophy of

leisure and recreation. —- Richard
Kraas, Teachers College, Columbia
University.

Administration of Public Administra-
tion, lynn 5. Rodney. Ronald Press, 15
East 26th Street, New York 10010. Pp.
475. $8.00.

DR. RODNEY writes from his wide ex-
perience as an administrator, as
a National Recreation Association dis-
trict representative, which gave him an
opportunity to study and observe many
different recreation and park opera-
tions in various parts of the country,
and as a university professor. His book
“is designed as an introduction to the
general field of recreation administra-
tion and as an aid to members of rec-
reation administration and as an aid
to members of recreation boards, rec-
reation leaders, park personnel, and
others involved with recreation and
park relationships in better under-
standing the problems and responsibil-
ities facing the administrative staff of
a recreation system.” It should be
equally valuable to the student entering
the field and the practitioner on the
job.

Dr. Rodney believes that not enough

49

has been written in recreation adminis-
tration upon specifics; in other words,
while general concepts are needed,
their implementation needs to be
spelled out. Therefore, he develops
guides that are specific and applicable
to administrative situations.

Dr. Rodney takes a strong stand on
the importance of goals. He states
broad aims and objectives and relates
them to administration. He discusses
concepts and meanings but he does not
stop there. The goals, concepts, and
meanings are translated into the prac-
tical, how-to-do-it procedures with a
wealth of detail that will help the ad-
ministrator achieve the goals and make
the concepts meaningful. The book be-
comes more practical and specific as it
progresses into personnel policies, fi-
nance and budget administration, fee-
charging practices and policies, areas
and facilities, and, finally, to a gener-
ous appendix containing state enabling
acts, charters and ordinances, sample
organization charts, agreements for co-
operation between school and recrea-
tion authorities, sample playground
programs, bond prospectus, a section
on space requirements for a neighbor-
hood recreation center and individual
areas and facilities—Arthur Todd, Di-

Do It in a Day Puppets for Beginners,
Margaret Weeks Adair. John Day

Company, 62 West 45th Street, New
York 10036, N. Y.

D ON’T MISS THIS! It’s real puppet
fun, packed with action, color, and

laughter. It’ll take the pout out of pup-
petry. The moppets will love that dog
made out of a H00r duster, with green
Christmas tree balls for eyes, and that
sea serpent made out of a rubber hair-
spray and hose—wand so will you.

This 81/2”-by-11” book was written
by an expert to overcome two big weak-
nesses in many puppet programs: Pup-
pets take too long to make and the play
takes too long to rehearse. We might
add a third problem: The difficulty of
finding a puppet play.

Four different kinds of hand puppet
are described. All can be costumed
from one uniform pattern. The puppets
are made from paperbags, old gloves
and socks, styrofoam, and from odds
and ends. Nothing very unusual about

this, but what is added is what really
counts, the mannerisms, decorative
touches, sound effects, et cetera that
turn puppets into people.

Three puppet plays, based upon chil-
dren’s creative dramatic programs in-

volving storytelling, are included. The
plays in their final form require a nar-
rator and sometimes a chorus or sound

maker. The puppets pantomine the
50

stories—no lines to learn! By the time
you and the children have produced
these puppets and plays, you’ll be able
to add other wonderful tales. It’s just
that simple—V. M.

Barbour. Michigan State University
Press. East Lansing. Pp. 190. $7.50.

THE CLOSE TIES established in this
publication between technical de-

velopment and music of the 18th cen-
tury make it doubly useful. Band, or-
chestra, and choral conductors and per-
formers will gain a better understand-
ing of brass instruments, how they are
actually used, and of musical literature.
After all, the 18th century boasts of two
of the greatest composers of all times,
Bach and Handel, with Mozart and
Haydn following shortly thereafter.
Their choral and instrumental scores
contain many parts for brass instru-
ments. Mr. Barbour’s identification of
these parts and their explanation will
be of practical help in preparing per-
formances of their works. In addition,
Mr. Barbour introduces a practically
unknown and fascinating composer, a

Folksongs and ballads are world travel-

A host of them turned up in Ohio. Miss
