Remarkable new discovery!
NEWKWIK-KOLD INSTANT lCE-PAK.

Gives instant cold that lasts up
to 1A; hour! For sprains, swell-
ing, bruises and minor bleed-
ing. Helps minimize injury,
speed recovery.

Doctors know that prompt applica-
tion of cold is one of the most impor-
tant first aid treatments for injury. And
bow fast cold is applied can often make
the difference between days, and even
weeks, of recuperation.

Now a new scientific discovery called
KWIK-KOLD makes it possible for
anyone—anywhere—to get the medi-
cal benefits of cold in a hurry!

New K‘VIK-KOLD Instant Ice-
Pak gives you instant cold for any in-
jury. Relieves pain on the spot—re-
duces swelling and minor bleeding.
Much faster and handier to use than
old-fashioned ice bags and, unlike ice,
is always available, is not messy, is easy
to carry on tI‘IPS.

Quick and easy to apply. Just
squeeze the plastic bag and—in just
2 seconds—you get instant cold that
stays cold up to half an hour! The tough
yet flexible plastic bag conforms read-
ily to body contours. Non-toxic and
safe, even if the bag is punctured.
Keeps for extended periods of time.

Kwik-Kold provides ready relief for
athletic injuries. Used by the 1960 U.S.
Olympic Team, Kwik-Kold should be
standard equipment for all football,
basketball, and baseball teams as well
as other athletic groups. For all sports
injuriesusprains, black eyes, cuts and

bruises—Kwik-Kold is handy and effec-

tive, indoors, outdoors, in all seasons.

New KIVIK-KOLB belongs in the
first aid kit of everyone who has to
deal with sudden injuries. Get Kwik-
Kold from your local first aid equip-
ment supplier or write International

" Instant Cold!

 

Kwik-Kold can be stored at any tempera-

ture, always ready for immediate use.
Tou h yet flexible plastic bag contains
dry old-Crystals and an inner
special fluid. When you squeeze )ag. fluid
is released to activate crystals and give
instant cold. Apply as you would an ice
pack. Bag measures 6" x 9", conforms
smoothly to body contours, is not lumpy,
messy, or drippy. Dispose ofbag after use.

IIow Cold Works in the
Treu ttnent of Injuries :

Cold is medically recognized for
its value in the treatment of vari-
ous injuries. In minor bleeding,
cold has an astringent action 011
tissues and constricts capillaries,
thus acts to reduce blood flow at
the site of the wound. By reduc-
ing effusion of blood to wound,
cold helps reduce swelling, indom-
mation, and discoloration in bruises
and sprains. The local anesthetic
effect of cold helps relieve pain.
And because it restricts blood
flow to and from the wound, cold
slows spread of venom in treating
insect and snake bites.

ouch of

Ilow To Use Cold in
Entorgency First A ill :

Spruins. Elevate injured part to a
comfortable position. Apply cold [Midis

to sprain to ease swelling and relieve
pain.

Bruises, Black Eyes. Apply cold
pack promptly to bruise for ‘20 to 25
minutes. Cold inhibits flow ofhlood to
wound, helps limit discoloration, re-
duce swelling and pain.

Illeedlnt . In bleeding from the nose,
the head should be kept erect, as low-
ering the head tends to encourage con-
tinued flow of blood. Apply cold to the
nose, and if the bleeding is from near
the tip of nose, pinch the nostrils to-
gether for a few minutes. In bleeding
from cuts and abrasions, keep the area
raised and apply cold in conjunction
with other prescribed treatment.

Insect & Snake Bite: For bcc, wasp
and hornet stings, remove stinger with
sterilized needle or knife point. Apply
cold to sting to relieve pain and slow
absorption of venom. Apply calamine
lotion to relieve itching. For ant, clzig-
ger and mosquito bites, wash affected
parts with soap and water, then apply
paste of baking soda. Applv cold to
reduce swelling. For snal'c bitc, follow
prescribed first aid procedure, using
cold application on wound to relieve
pain and help limit spread of venom.

Sunstroko. For mild sunstroke
(marked by headache, fatigue, dizzi-
ness and, perhaps, fainting), cool pa-
tient off quickly. Apply cold packs to

head to help lower body temperature.

.‘linor Burns. Follow recommended
first aid procedures to exclude air from
burned area and prevent contamina-
tion. Appl)v cold packs to relieve pain.

()tlwr Uses. Cold packs may be con-
sidered for use in conjunction with
other appropriate first aid measures in
treating minor head injuries, suspected
appendicitis, headache and fever,
toothache, and fainting.

For livelier play... less debate

FOOTBALL
 FLAG BELTS

use

Was he tagged—or wasn’t he? You know—for sure—when “touch”
football players wear Voit Game Belts and Flags.

They make the game more fun...more like the real McCoy, only
safer...and make officiating easier.

Here, at last, is a device long-needed to standardize and popularize
the game. And though developed principally to improve non-tackling
football games, these belts and flags are ideal for all tag games. In
any game, they end the argument of whether or not an official tag
was made. They may be used anywhere—schoolground, playground,
football field, gymnasium—even skating rinks or swimming pools.

Each player’s set consists of a belt and a pair of colored flags, one
worn on each hip. Made of flexible vinyl, they are durable, water-
proof, safe, inexpensive. Flags are attached to belt by plastic snaps.
Red flags are worn by one team; yellow by the other. Four sizes of
belts to accommodate any player from elementary school to adult

recreational program.

GUEST EDITORIAL

 

MY PHILOSOPHY OF RECREATION

This is the first in a series of guest editorials on this subject by

Robert W. Crawford

OUR MODERN society with its fast
pace has produced many new at-
titudes toward leisure as well as toward
work. As we are exposed to new expe-
riences, and as we analyze the writings
and teachings of scholars in allied

 

fields, we are constantly checking and
revising our philosophy in terms of our
stated objectives. Even though we change phases of our phi-
losophy in the light of new discoveries, the basic principles
remain and history has recorded (and no doubt will con-
tinue to record) the important role of recreation in the life
of man.

As one studies the history of public recreation in Amer-
ica, it is apparent that our philosophy has undergone radi-
cal changes since a half century ago in Boston when justifi-
cation of recreation was built on prevention of juvenile de-
linquency and provision of sand piles for small children.
In tracing leisure concepts through earlier societies, I find
it interesting to note that the word leisure is used only once
in connection with Biblical days and that is recorded in
Mark 6:31: “For many were coming and going and they
had no leisure even to eat.” This is explained in the previ-
ous verse when “the disciples wanted to go to a lonely place
and rest a while.” One can readily see that their philosophy
of recreation was narrow, as throughout the Old Testament
—-though the pace of living was comparatively slow—lei-
sure as such was apt to be associated with laziness and
therefore condemned.

Our forefathers, who adopted the Declaration of Inde-
pendence in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776 held it to be self
evident that all men are endowed by their creator with cer-
tain unalienable rights among which are life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. This emphasizes the fact that we
are constantly searching for life’s meaning. There is not a
day in our lives when we do not try to gather up the mean-
ing of life in some kind of expression of attitude. Presuma-
bly, life has a purpose. Life is not such a thing so disorderly
as to indicate that there is no divine intelligence at the helm.
Surely one should enjoy life in spite of his inability to un-
derstand all that is involved.

outstanding people in the field of recreation

EVEN THOUGH WE have been endowed with the right to

pursue happiness, we can’t consciously pursue happi-
ness and hope to catch it. Essays by Wilfred Petersen on the
“Art of Giving” state that happiness does not depend upon
what happens outside of you, but on what happens inside
of you. It is measured by the spirit in which you meet the
problems of life. Happiness is a state of mind. Lincoln
once said, “We are as happy as we make up our minds to
be.” Often happiness comes upon one unawares while one
is engaged in helping others. Perhaps it is best expressed
by the old Hindu proverb, “Help thy brother’s boat across
and lo! thine own has reached the shore.” This can be
achieved through participation in wholesome recreation.
Emerson stated this in another way when he said, “The only
true gift is a portion of thyself.” It has been said that the
finest gift a man can give to his age and time is the gift of a
constructive and creative life.

The provision of opportunities to develop constructive
and creative lives is a worthy objective of the recreation
profession. Our role is to help people to develop into happy,
mature, self-disciplined, well-informed, articulate and so-
cially responsible citizens. We like to think that our depart-
ment in Philadelphia has a responsibility to see that every
citizen is made aware of the potential of the worthy use of
leisure for life enrichment and that we must strive to assist
in some measure those who need help to become recrea-
tionally self-suHicient.

Recreation is not merely buildings, playgrounds, swim-
ming pools, camps, beaches, or parks. Recreation is not
just games, drama, or opera. These are facilities and activi-
ties, the tools of our trade. Recreation is people—first, last,
and always. Therefore, the recreators have an obligation
to provide facilities, program, and leadership to all seg-
ments of the population, including children, youth, adults,
those who are ill or handicapped, the hospitalized, the aged,
the homebound and those institutionalized. The program
must be based on freedom of personal choice and must he.

voluntary.

The recreator must agree on the purpose of the service
he promotes. Recreation activities are engaged in for the
satisfaction directly received, and not conscientiously for
rewards beyond that satisfaction itself. The activity he-
comes an end in itself when the. end includes the many con-
comitant values such as physical, emotional, cultural, social,

~ 339

and spiritual. However, justification of these purposes need
not be on the basis of any one associate value.

RECREATION PROGRAMS cannot survive by basing their
justification solely on the isolated pinnacle of satisfac-
tion and enjoyment as the end result. While these values form
the summit of our objective, they cannot stand without sup-
porting values. Merely keeping young people busy and off
the street is not sufficient justification for expenditures of

large sums of money for recreation. It is what happens to
the individual as a result of his participation that counts.
The answer rests largely with our leadership as we strive for
the goals of a richer and more abundant life for all, the full-

est development of every individual.
Recreation programs must have breadth and depth. We
must think in broader terms than we have in the past. There

    
    

  
  

must be a greater balance and variety in our programs. The
“programs need to be more adventuresome and creative and
the facilities need to be more imaginative and challenging.

Put a twinkle in his eye ~— _
laughter in his v01ce ~— warmth 
inyou'r‘heart. ' '

 
  
 

We must put greater stress on the moral and ethical values
that can be derived through meaningful recreation pro-
grams. We must stress the dignity of each human being——
the responsibilities of citizenship as well as the rights and
privileges. Recreation is not the frosting on the cake; it is

one of the important ingredients of life; and we must seek
to utilize every opportunity in our leadership of recreation
for developing lasting values.

The eyes and ears of the recreation movement must be
opened to the greater possibilities of tomorrow. We must
expand our horizons—stimulate our imagination, wake up
our creativity, and make the lives of the people with whom

PHILOSOPHY OF OUTDOOR EDUCATION

WILLIAM H. FREEBERG AND LOREN E. TAYLOR ' ,
Southern Illinois University \5 \\

This is the first book to be devoted entirely to the field of education outside the class-
room. Demacrotic group living, conservative education, healthful outdoor living and
leisure time education are stressed as concepts vitally important to the American way
at life. The authors advocate setting goals, then reaching them effectively and efticiently,
even though accepted educational practices may have to be changed.

CHILDREN ARE HUMAN [Even AI’ Camp]

MARIE HARTWIG, University of Michigan
BETTYE MYERS, Texas Woman's University

This book is refreshing and challenging, an excellent reminder that the child is the
essential element in camping. Camping is presented as a human experience of relation-
ships between camper and camper, camper and counselor. The counselor whose interest
and attention are focused on the child rather than on teaching a skill is considered

important. I961; 99 pages; $2.25

Aftermath
Sirs:

May I express my appreciation for
the way that RECREATION covered our
recent article on play apparatus design
and construction [April]. . . . We have
received a number of requests for the
plans of some of the equipment dis-
cussed in the article; among them, a re-
quest from the National Park Service
for various units to be included in the
Design book of that agency.

Allow me also to compliment you for
the excellent format concept of the mag-
azine over the past few months. I feel
the change has been a very worthwhile
one and have heard many compliments
from fellow professionals in Southern
California that I should like to pass on
to you.

Harold Lathrop

News has just come of the sudden death
of Harold W. Lathrop, state director
of parks and recreation in Colorado, on
August 1. His untimely passing, as the
result of a heart attack at the age of
sixty, will be deeply regretted by his
large circle of park and recreation
friends. Born in Wisconsin, educated in
Minnesota, and a long-time resident of
Colorado, Harold was a true citizen of
the West. Professionally he was a civil
engineer and a park man with an unusu-
ally broad understanding of the human
importance of the whole field of recre-
ation. The greater part of his profes-
sional life was devoted to Minnesota,
where he served for twenty-one years,
and to the work of the National Recrea-
tion Association on whose staff he
served for eleven years—September
1, 1946 to November 30, 1957. He
was a specialist not only on state
parks but on state government as
well, and he knew intimately the
governments of the eighteen Western
states he served as a staff member of the
Association. A life member of the Na-
tional Conference on State Parks, of
which he served as president for four
years, he also held long—time afEliations
with other park and recreation organi-
zations. Harold was a devoted husband,
father, and grandfather and a genial,
friendly, informal person. He once said
of his work, “I spend my time doing
what I like to do and I get paid for it.”

Pat Haggerty

We are sorry to have to report, too,
that Pat Haggerty died one day after
Harold Lathrop, on August 2. He was
a familiar figure at recreation confer-
ences and Congresses and an outstand-
ing leader in the recreation field. First
member of the recreation staff of the
Board of Park Commissioners of Wich-
ita, Kansas, he later became superin-
tendent of recreation, in which capacity
he served for many years. During the
period 1955—58 he was an active and
helpful member of the NRA Midwest
District Advisory Committee. He will
be greatly missed by many friends and
colleagues.

 

Two Bills Signed by President

- THE CAPE Con NATIONAL SEASHORE
is now a fact, and 26,666 acres of the

SEPTEMBER 1961

cape’s historic beach and natural
beauty will be protected from private
and commercial development for the
enjoyment of all people. This action
has been fought by some local au-
thorities, residents, merchants, and
the like. Residents are afraid that
the national seashore will attract mil-
lions of one-day visitors and have, to
quote one resident, “motels and gas
stations all over the place.” There will
be great rejoicing on the part of others.

' THE ANTIPOLLUTION BILL provides
more money to extend federal action in
preventing water pollution, by granting
funds to states and cities to curb nui-
sances. Citizens who want purer streams
and lakes will therefore look first to
their state and local governments. The
state and communities will have to put
up $7 for every $3 granted in federal
funds. One important provision makes
the new law applicable to all navigable
waters. At present, federal action is
restricted to bodies of water that cross
state lines and to instances where the
pollution itself crosses state lines.

} ALSO PASSED: The Open Space and

Urban Development Act of 1961, a
forward stride in the race for open
space.

} INTRODUCED TO THE 87TH CONGRESS:
Bill S. 1863, to be known as the “Senior
Citizens Service Training Act,” urges
training of the thousands of men and

 

women “who are still able and willing
to make contributions to the civic de-
velopment of their communities and na—
tion” for part-time roles in a broad area
of unfilled occupations in the fields of
health, education, and welfare. These
roles are to be determined by man-
power surveys conducted by the Secre-
tary of Health, Education, and Welfare
on a regional basis. Training will be
established and conducted by the secre—
tary “in cooperation with state and
local governments and civic agencies.”

This the first of a series of statements about recreation and leisure made
by leaders of business and industry at the invitation of Joseph Prendergast,
executive director of the National Recreation Association.

ECREATION, in my opinion, is an integral part of well-balanced living,
R and should be exactly what the word implies—a meaningful, enjoyable
activity, either mental or physical, completely outside the sphere of normal
work, which “re-creates” the stamina, strength and lively interest needed to

function as complete human beings.

Recreation should be deliberately sought, as a change of pace, but not ex-
cessively planned since part of its value is its release that we are obliged

to do. Yet it should not be simply a thoughtless dissipation of the precious

time we are allotted in our life-span. . O
The expansion of our leisure makes 1t essential to use a part of it for

I I 
genuine, purposeful “recreation.

) THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED PROPOSAL
to convert Welfare Island, in New York
City’s East River, into a huge housing
project or sub-city has been greeted by
a strong letter of protest in the New
York Herald Tribune, signed by Luther
Gulick, August Heckscher, Lewis Mum-
ford, and six other prominent citizens.
It says in part. “All are agreed: That
there is too little open land, park area,
recreation area, existing or available.
That this condition is growing worse.
That it is alarmingly bad throughout
our cities, but particularly so in the cen-
tral areas where the need is also great-
est. In New York we have in the three
major East River islands an exciting
possibility for substantial amounts of
open green space close to central
heavily populated areas. This is visually
so close at hand and so beautifully be-
stowed by nature that its spiritual value
can be felt daily by thousands. . . . Cer-
tainly no new structures should be plan-
ned or built which will diminish the
quantity or quality of this happiest use.
. . . This is the greatest and last single
opportunity for the center of our city
to be further beautified since the crea-
tion of Central Park. In a sense we
should be grateful to the private hous-
ing proposal for dramatizing the issue.”

) NEW YORK STATE ADDS TO ITS PARKS
by the purchase of three tracts, 275
acres to Palisades Interstate Park, 1353
acres to Adirondacks State Park, and
103 acres to Catskill State Park. These
are being bought under the $75,000,000
bond issue approved by the voters last
year.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

) PRIVATE GIFTS for the Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, Winston Lake
Park have reached $310,000. An addi-
tional $60,000 was given by Hanes
Hosiery Mills Company, P. H. Hanes
Knitting Company, Hanes Dye and
Finishing Company, and Wachovia
Bank and Trust Company. Mr. Hanes,
civic and business leader, spearheaded
the drive. A few months ago he an-
nounced that $250,000 had been given
by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Com-
pany and the Z. Smith Reynolds
Foundation.

) A PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL FITNESS for
school children has been urged by
President Kennedy in a recent news
conference, with the suggestion of fif-
teen minutes per day to be devoted to
vigorous exercise for boys and girls
alike. He asked that fitness tests be
used “to determine their physical abil-
ity and evaluate their progress,” and
that the schools work with the under-
developed pupil to improve his physical
capacity.

) ONE HUNDRED MILLION VISITS TO NA-
TIONAL FORESTS are predicted for this
year. We hope that our readers urged
their communities to observe Secretary
of Agriculture Freeman’s urgent re-
quest for care in preserving the forests’
safety from fire, and their beauty—so
valuable and so easily destroyed by lit-
ter or careless camping practices.

) FOUR NATIONALLY KNOWN LEADERS
in physical education and recreation
have been appointed members of a
Women’s Advisory Board to the United
States Olympic Development Commit-
tee; among them Mrs. Sara Staff Jerni-
gan of the recreation iield. She is vice-
president and chairman, AAPER divi-
sion for girls’ and women’s sports, a
member of the National Recreation As-
sociation and of the American Recrea-
tion Society. She is director of physical
education and recreation at Stetson
University, De Land, Florida, and also
coordinator Of campus recreation at
Stetson. Others named are Mrs. Janet
H. Bachna, Canton, Ohio, coach of the
1959 Pan American and 1960 Olympic
women’s gymnastic teams; Dr. Thelma
Bishop, chairman, women’s profes-
sional curriculum, department of
health, physical education, and recrea-
tion at Michigan State University, East
Lansing; and Dr. Ann Paterson, chair-
man, women’s physical education, San
Francisco State College, California.

) FIVE ACCIDENTAL DEATHS in sandlot

football in 1959 were reported in the
May 29th AMS News, according to the
National Safety Council bulletin P5.
In addition, high-school games ac-
counted for four deaths, college games,
three, and semi-pro games, two.

) THE AMERICAN STANDARDS ASSOCIA-
TION has been asked to develop safety
standards for skin diving and Scuba,
at the request of the Compressed Gas
Association, according to P8. Discus-
sion indicated a need for standard
markings and colors for equipment such
as floats and Hags and standards for
pressure in tanks and for the purity of
the air used. Also it pointed out was
a need for standardization of statistics
concerning diving accidents. It was
suggested that the proposed ASA proj-
ect might develop a standard report
form for doctors to fill out.

Budget and Finance for Recreation

Participants at the Sixth National In-
stitute in Recreation Administration in
Detroit September 29-30, will represent
all of the National Association Associa-
tion’s field districts, thirty-three states,

Europe. They range in age from twenty-
four to sixty-one; average age is forty-
four. The experience range is from one
to thirty-eight years with an average
Of twenty-two. Of 110 delegates report-
ing on educational background, 91%
have college degrees and the others re-
port some college; 52% have college
education beyond the bachelor’s degree,
with 44.5% reporting master’s degrees
or better. A quarter of this year’s par-
ticipants come from New England;
15.6% from the Southern District;
33.9% from the Great Lakes; 15%
from the Midwest, Southwest, and the
Far West. Canada is represented by
4.3% and the US. Air Force by 5.2%.
Managing authorities increasingly are
censidering the National Institutes as
an important experience for their park
and recreation personnel with seven-
tenths or more of the agencies this year
paying the Institute fee for their
executives.

RECREATION

 

ARY QUIRK, friend of everyone
M whom she had ever met, died June
2 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, after a
long illness. To the very end she re-
tained her gay spirit and wanted to hear
the latest news about the recreation
movement. Mary had that wonderful
gift of seeing life, people, and the
world through fresh, interested and un-
critical eyes, much as children do. Her
enthusiasm and her obvious enjoyment
rubbed off on those around her and
added color and drama to the common-
place. The hundreds of cards, notes,
and letters that were sent her were the
bright spots of her days—and a slight
indication of the affection friends all
over the world felt for her. She is sur-
vived by a sister, Mrs. C. Francis Egan,
408 Pomeroy Avenue, Pittsfield.

Mary loved pe0ple, she loved work-
ing with people. She was executive sec-
retary of the Woman’s Club in Pitts-
field for nineteen years, taking a leave
of absence in 1943 to join the Volun-
teers for the American Red Cross in
\Vashington, D. C. She was first direc-
tor of the Embassy Club, a training cen-
ter for overseas women workers, later
became assistant chief of personnel ad-
ministration in the Red Cross returnee
unit. In 1945 she was made chief of
employee activities, with all community
service along entertainment and recrea-
tional lines by more than three thousand
Red Cross workers being cleared
through her. A recent citation she re-
ceived for her work with the Red Cross

SEPTEMBER 1961

gave her great satisfaction.

In 1946 she joined the National Rec-
reation Association as district executive
secretary, working primarily out of its
Los Angeles oHice and from New York
City headquarters, both of which in-
volved travel throughout the United
States. Wherever she went, she made
new friends—and never forgot her old
ones.

FILLED with a tremendous zest for

living, she loved to “share.” Friends
often received a card written against a
lamppost while Mary waited for a bus,

or theater tickets for a play that Mary

had enjoyed, or a clipping that she had
read and found interesting. At confer-
ences and at the National Recreation
Congress each year, headwaiters would
blanche, because what had started out
as a tete-a-tete with Mary was likely to
wind up as “a table for fourteen,
please,” Mary’s “groups” became a by-
word and no one laughed more about
it than Mary herself.

Her infectious laugh, her gay “How’s
every little thing by you?” and her ca-
pacity for friendship with young and
old, rich and poor, are gifts she has left
to all who have known her. #

0 At the request of some of her
friends, the National Recreation Asso-
ciation has established a Mary Quirk
Memorial Fund. Anyone who wishes
to contribute to it is invited to do so.

For lhe 43rd
National Recreation Congress

THE CRACKERBARREL of yester—
year may be filled with ideas
for tomorrow. Drop in at the
Crackerbarrel Corner at the 43rd
National Recreation Congress, Oc-
tober 1-6, and swap some shop talk
with your fellow delegates, get ad-
vice about problems and peeves,
pick up some know-how about new program ideas. The
crackerbarrel at the crossroad general store was the sound-
ing board of homespun America; the Congress crackerbar-
rel will be the sounding board at the crossroads of the rec-
reation World.

Another glimpse of times gone by will be given during
a production of Carousel by the Detroit Department of
Parks and Recreation at the Ford Auditorium in the city’s
new Civic Center. The production will include more than
150 singers, dancers, and actors, members of the Detroit
Civic Center Chorus and the Civic Center Children’s Chorus.
The Rodgers and Hammerstein score includes such hits as
“June Is Bustin’ Out All Over” and “This Was a Real Nice
Clambake.”

While the Congress social meetings do not extend to
clambakes, several get-acquainted events are being intro-
duced into the program. These start with a Welcome Ses-
sion for Board Members on October 1, followed that eve-
ning by a cafeteria-style Get-Acquainted Dinner and a social
recreation program. An All-Congress Breakfast the next
morning will allow another opportunity for delegates to
meet new acquaintances and greet old ones. The annual
All-Congress Banquet and Dance takes place on October 3.
( See Congress Program Digest on Page 348 for other
events.)

Other details about Detroit are covered by Edward T.
McGowan, first deputy superintendent of parks and recrea-
tion in Detroit, in his article on Pages 350-1. H

CITY

DETROIT anxiously awaits the 43rd
National Recreation Congress del-
egates and the opportunity of showing

parks, beaches, and zoo acreage. The
Motor City boasts a more liberal por-
tion of publicly owned outdoor play

 

and relaxing space than any other
major city, according to data compiled by the Detroit City

Destination Detroit—October 1-6

Plan Commission. There are seventy-five thousand acres of
public parks in the five-county Detroit metropolitan area,
one acre for every fifty persons.

The more than ninety parks and recreation areas run a
wide gamut and include a riverside lounging spot within
five minutes’ walk of the downtown hotels and oiiice build-
ings, a one-thousand-acre island park where deer roam
through virgin woods, a zoo of tame and baby animals in a
Mother Goose setting, one of the world’s largest patrolled
fresh-water beaches, an island amusement park reached by
a two-hour river cruise, the zoo which pioneered in display-
ing wild animals in barless settings, a rolling forty-five hun-
dred acres of woods, beach, and meadowland twenty-two
miles from downtown. Breeze-swept Belle Isle in the De-
troit River between Detroit and Canada has been Detroit’s

-favorite cooling-0H place for three generations. In and

around Detroit there are a dozen public beaches, thirteen
outdoor swimming pools and five indoor-outdoor pools,
convertible on cue from the weather by sliding glass walls.

There are nine artificial ice rinks, which permit outdoor
ice skating on even the mildest winter days. Toboggan and
sled runs are numerous, and within an hour’s drive from
downtown Detroit are several areas open for skiing day
and night.

Four park systems cater to Detroit’s recreation needs.
City, county, regional, and state park networks extend out
in almost concentric circles. The five—county Huron-Clin-
ton Metropolitan Authority is a unique example of inter-
county cooperation in the field of recreation. It now oper-

ates five parks and several miles of parkway along the
valleys of the Huron and Clinton Rivers. The Detroit De-
partment of Parks and Recreation conducts play and in-
formal education programs at 363 playgrounds and play-
iields, 39 year-round recreation centers, and 162 recreation
school centers.

A year-round program is conducted by 191 full-time staff
members whose numbers are augmented with specialists
and seasonal personnel. A total of 1186 employees was
reached during the intensified 1960 program.

Model playground equipment is constructed by the De-
partment of Parks and Recreation, and a total of ninety-six
playgrounds are using this equipment. An experimental
ice-rink slab, using polyethylene pipe cast permanently in
concrete has been designed, constructed, and successfully
operated at Butzel Playiield. The development, mainte-
nance, and beautification of the department’s 363 sites, to-
taling approximately 5,831 acres, includes maintenance of
65,000 street shade trees. The Junior Forester Program at-
tracts over seven hundred participants. Nature programs
are conducted in 252 different groups.

D ETROIT IS A PIONEER in furnishing municipal specialized

recreation for senior citizens, the handicapped, deaf,
blind, and mentally retarded. A handicapped children’s
camp at Rouge Park and Lakewood is conducted during
the summer months. Using much the same procedure for
Detroit’s retarded children, the department devises games
and crafts they are able to perform, providing them with the
first recreation they had ever been able to enjoy.

The recreation department music program has been a
tradition for more than forty years. Pageants, festivals,
musical plays, concerts, recreation center programs, and
civic programs have been the bulwark of this program, and
in 1957 the activities of the civic center chorus were added.
This latter is a year-round choral group conducted by the
Department of Parks and Recreation. Since that time the
chorus has performed a variety of programs ranging from
dedications, banquets, Christmas lighting programs, and
radio and television programs, to Broadway musicals. The
latter musicals alone have played before capacity audiences
of more than fifty thousand persons, at Ford Auditorium
and the Belle Isle Aqua Theater. The chorus is also going
to be responsible for some of the entertainment at the Na-
tional Recreation Congress (see Pages 347-49).

The Teen Talent Chorus was established in 1959 and
similarly was a result of a long tradition of singing activi-
ties among this age bracket, as was the Civic Center Chil-
dren’s Chorus begun in 1960 on a city-wide basis. All three
of these musical organizations are open to membership by
all Detroit area residents. An LP recording of their music,
called Sound of Detroit, is available from the Detroit De-
partment of Parks and Recreation. This first recording was
done in Old Mariners Church in the new Detroit Civic Cen-

ter and recorded by RCA Victor ($2.95) .

Special tours will highlight the Congress so that all dele-
gates can have an opportunity to see firsthand some of the
above facilities and activities in action. #

MAN’S NEED FOR. OPEN SPACE 1

Man must not lose a sense of

bigness outside himself

or his spirit will shrink

John A. Carver, Jr.

HERE HAVE BEEN two lessons
T learned, among others, from
the astronauts’ few minutes
out of this world. We have learned
that it is not necessary to leave the
sights and sounds of our own at-
mosphere in order to thrill vicari-
ously in a fellow man’s sampling of
such an escape; and we have learned that such escape may
be enormously expensive. In such terms, we must learn to
think about man’s need for parkland and open space here
on this planet—the paradox that man needs some open-
ness, though he himself may never sample it; and that to
get it will not be easy or cheap.

By 1980 about sixty million additional humans will be
added to the population of our country’s metropolitan cen-
ters, and fifty million of them will live in new suburbs, in
new houses on new streets. The children will attend schools
which are not yet built. Country which is open space today
will furnish their driveways. In order to accommodate
these new Americans, many wild and beautiful countrysides
will be buried beneath the waves of population, pollution,
proHigacy, and what some people call progress.

Those areas will have vanished like so many of the forests
and grasslands of the past; like the clear water from our
springs and streams; like the topsoil we have spilled into
the seas; like the departed heath hen, the Eskimo curlew,
the Atlantic salmon and the passenger pigeon.

It is a cruel hoax to dismiss the thought with a comforta-
ble recollection that vast open areas still exist in the West.
. . . “What meaning,” they ask in the West, “can a mountain
lake in the Sawtooths have to an Easterner who never in
his lifetime [may] see it?” The same meaning, I submit,
that the astronauts” trips had to all of us. Man’s spirit
soars in the escape of others. John Muir said it:

“. . . if I should be fated to. walk no more with Nature,
be compelled to leave all I most devoutly love in the wilder-

ness, return to civilization and be twisted into the character-
less cable of society, then these sweet free, cumberless rov-

ings will be as chinks and slits on life’s horizon, through
which I may obtain glimpses of the treasures that lie in
God’s wilds beyond my reach.”

I cannot paint a rosy picture of the future for our cru-
sade to save the nation’s parkland and open spaces. With
the cooperation of many interested groups, we can win, but
it will be a grinding battle all the way.

T HE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR is responsible for a vast

department with a multiplicity of duties. He is the
Cabinet member responsible for the operation and admin-
istration of huge dams and enormous reservoirs, giant pub-
lic land holdings, mining, grazing, fisheries, wildlife man-
agement, and other large government projects. Yet of all
these assignments and more, he has chosen for his burning
personal interest the program for parks and open spaces.
The President has instructed him to take the lead in setting
the course of the executive branch in meeting the challenge
of our vanishing parklands.

It is no news to you, but a lot of Americans do not realize
how far we have gone already to using up and wasting our
national heritage. The pressure to commit the available
land to commercial exploitation is terrific.

Time is our mortal enemy in the struggle to get park
and recreation areas for present needs and to save them 
for future needs. We in the Federal Government need you if“
to put the heat on, to step up the temperature. Appeals from
the White House, glowing promises in Congressional bills,
dramatic pledges by the Interior Department are all very
fine intellectual exercises—but they are meaningless unless 3
the general public gets behind them and pushes en masse. {4‘

RECREATION

The nightmare rate at which the open country has been
sacrificed to the concrete mixer has shown clearly that the
task of protecting adequate parkland is simply too big for
most individual communities to handle alone. The Federal
Government is forced by events to play a major role in help-
ing towns and counties with the job. The Department of
the Interior is concentrating major efforts on the evaluation
of the national park needs. We are trying to do everything
we can to see that Easteners are provided with parks in the
East. It is a new approach—and long overdue. The Num-
ber One item on our legislative calendar is the Cape Cod
Seashore Bill. We want the Cape made part of the National
Park System, as Cape Hatteras has been saved for the
public. As we go to press, President Kennedy has just
signed the bill making 26,670 acres of Cape Cod’s Atlantic
shoreline into America’s second National Seashore. ( See
also Page 343.)

The preservation of Eastern parklands is expensive. But
it will be more costly in terms of damage to the human spirit
if we permit them to be buried under blacktop roads, park-
ing lots and barbecue shacks. Theodore Roosevelt said:
“The great natural resources which are vital to the welfare
of the whole people should be kept either in the hands or
under the full control of the whole people for the benefit of
all our people and not monopolize for . . . the few.”

Exchange on Plans and Practices

Three articles in the February 1961 issue of Atlantic
Monthly, entitled “Our National Parks in Jeopardy,” voiced
some of the criticisms of the American people in relation
to our national parks system and National Park Service.
These gave rise to an exchange of lengthy memoranda be-
tween Park Service Director Conrad Wirth and Secretary
of the Interior Stewart L. Udall. In reporting in detail to
Secretary Udall on the policies and practices of Mission 66,

Mr. W irth summed up:

ested friends of the parks that the

in those portions of the parks most affected by man, and
adjusting to the political realism of serving many elements
within our society.

“Of primary importance in the entire question, however,
is that those who are most concerned about the problem of
increasing visitation to the parks and pressures on them to
meet the recreational needs of the American people are
agreed that there must be a concerted effort at all levels of
our economy to add new national, state and local parks and

PRESIDENT KENNEDY had that admonition in mind when
he warned in his natural resources message: “Our en-
tire society rests upon and is dependent upon our water,
our land, our forests, our minerals. How we use these re-
sources influences our health, our security, our economy
and well being. And if we fail to chart a proper course of
conservation and development, if we fail to use these bless-
ings properly, we will be in trouble within a short time.”
The public cheerfully spends millions of dollars for high-
ways, cars to $11 them with, cloverleaf interchanges, and
overpasses. But only pennies are allotted, and then reluc-
tantly, for the acquisition of land for park uses. Parklands
are expensive. But can we afford not to buy them? Costs
are doubling about every ten years. Is it economically
sound to put off any longer what we should have done years
ago?

Sherwood Anderson said that when America was new and
men were often alone in the fields and forests, they got a
sense of bigness outside themselves that has now in some
way been lost. The bigness of the country took the shrill-
ness out of them and they learned the trick of quietness.

“We simply need some wild country available to us even
if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in, for
it can be a means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as
creatures and part of the geography of our home.” #

 

other outdoor recreational areas and reserves.
“The next five years of Mission 66 must see the strength-
ening and enlargement of the National Park System.”

IN REPLYING to Mr. Wirth’s report, Secretary Udall pointed
out that a “tremendously expanded” outdoor recreation
program for the nation is this Administration’s answer to
the problems posed by the ever-increasing numbers of peo-
ple visiting the national parks. “The easing of the visitor
flood at national park gates,” he said, “is absolutely essen-
tial in solving the problem of passing on the National Park
System unimpaired to future generations. . . .

“I am a strong believer in wilderness preservation and
you can depend on me to scrutinize all programs and ac-
tivities of the National Park Service with this viewpoint
clearly in mind. On the other hand, I feel very strongly that
the people do have a right to visit and enoy their parks and
they should not be described by such derogatory titles as
‘invading locusts,’ ‘tin-can tourists,’ ‘invading hordes,’ ‘ir-
responsible amusement seekers,’ etcetera. The vast majority
of these people are merely exercising a right to see and en-
joy their parks, and I believe that all except a small minority
have a good understanding of what the parks are for and
desire to use them in such a way that they can be preserved

for all time.

Terminology Revisited

The problem of nomenclature besetting the recreation profession

In February 1959, RECREATION pub-
lished a glossary of recreation terms
compiled by Carl Ruud, at that time a
graduate student at the University of
Illinois. Since then, the air has been
smog-thick with rebuttals, surrebuttals,
and counter-rebuttals.
been wide open to all and many have
entered. Now, Mr. Ruud, who sparked
the controversy in the first place, speaks

The arena has

again; here are his latest comments:

THE February
1959 RECREA-
TION article pre-
senting recreology
as a name for “the
study of recrea-
tion” accomplished
one thing of defi-
nite importance. It stimulated a lot of
thinking relative to “Saying What We
Mean.” Certain reactions to the origi-
nal presentation of recreology indicated

 

some misinterpretation of the original
intent of the word; others indicated
general understanding.

Recreation is one thing; recreology
is something else. This is what
prompted the original presentation of
the word recreology. Certain words are
developed as a result of necessity. Nor-
mal events demand new words, a clearer
expression of thinking, a separation of
thought and a division of certain areas
of knowledge. Recreology as a name
for the comparatively new social science
dealing with man’s recreative use of
leisure is presented in this spirit. Its
acceptance does not necessarily depend
on a particular group, profession, or
school of thought, but upon the extent
of its use by those who may encounter
it in various situations. Many new
words have been introduced into the
English language in recent centuries in
spite of Opposing forces exerted. Many
such words are now standard and com-
mon.

Recreology, as a science or a branch
of knowledge, may claim certain pur-

354

poses and objectives for itself that rec-
reation cannot employ. In broad sense
some of its purposes are: to investigate
the past, present, and future of the rec-
reation movement; to determine the ex-
tent of man’s use, misuse, and abuse of
leisure; to investigate various leisure
forces; and to study social problems
arising from our abundant leisure. Rec-
reation objectives will cause the evolu-
tion of recreology objectives.

Recreation, as a Werd, has limita-
tions which should be recognized. Rec-
reology, likewise as a word, has certain
limitations; the most obvious of these
is the fact that it can mean nothing
more than a study of or the science deal-
ing with man’s recreative activity dur-
ing leisure. Recreation and recreology,
as words, are as compatible as the two
areas of endeavor they represent. One
represents the “practice of” the other
represents the “study of.”

The word recreology was originally
designed to name a course of study in
“academic recreation” presented in my
master’s thesis. The course objective
is to help educate students in the worthy
use of leisure time through introducing
them to the importance of recreation.
The course, as it stresses the why and
when rather than the how and where of
recreation, is not recreation. I settled
on the word recreology for a course
name because recreation just did not
describe its ingredients. Recreology, as
an academic activity promoting con-
cepts and generalizations of a mental
nature, may eventually find its way into
the secondary school curriculum.

Finally: Is the word recreation so
entrenched in our minds and so musical
to our ears that it must be retained to
cover every aspect of the related move-
ment? Could not the study of this
movement be dignified under the title
of recreologyP—CARL RUUD, public-
school teacher and member of the park
board in Cashmere, Washington, and
summer recreation director, Central

Washington College of Education.

The following “supra-rebuttal” is
from Dr. Jay Shivers, an active voice
in the terminology forum:

H E C 0 N T R O -

VERSY now un-
derway among cer-
tain factions in the
field of recreation
service is most re-
warding and re-
freshing. It proves
that there are those who read, assimilate
information, and critically interpret the

 

various views being purveyed. The
field of recreation service will continue
to progress as long as logical arguments
are periodically'set forth and tested by
some form of research.

According to one source, recreation
is of Latin derivation. This notion is
erroneous. As is well known to all who
have studied Latin history, literature,
or grammar (rhetoric), the ancient Ro-
mans were remarkably adept at trans-
literation. They simply adopted, from
whole cloth, words or phrases that
suited them from other languages—~——usu-

ally Greek.
As usual the Greeks had a word for

everything, and recreation is one of
those words. Writing long before there
was any real effort by the Romans at
scholarship, Plato, in his Logos utilized
the term recreation. His pupil, Aris-
totle, is another Greek who made very
good use of this term, particularly as
he referred to it in its cathartic sense.
The student may find the term recrea-
tion utilized in Aristotle’s Poetics. 

It is unfortunate, of course, that defi-
nitions of recreation have tended to con-
centrate attention on aspects of leisure
and recuperation. Historically, these
are not valid features of the nature of a
recreation. Again, the Greeks gave us K}
the word for leisure; i.e., shola, free ft
time in which to undertake the more sig-
nificant activities of life. To the Greeks,
this meant education, aesthetic proj-
ects, taking part in government, and

i

pursuing excellence. From the Greek
word for leisure modern culture ob-
tains its word for school.

The Latin word lupus, originally
meaning wolf, came to be associated
with feasting and dancing. Through
further common usage the word became
ludi or play. It is this meaning which
has been traditionally evoked for leisure
and recreational activity. There is a
strong suspicion, among some authori-
ties, that the Latin ludi became angli-
cized to leisure and from that aspect
picked up its recreational overtones.
The most valid and logical meaning of
recreation, on the other hand, has been
in terms of reproducing some thing or
some one, which had prior creation,
but which, through external pressure or
internal decay succumbed to imbalance
or disequilibrium. Recreation, in the
literal sense of the word, means har-
mony, balance, or equilibrium. Some-
where in the etymological development
of the term, theorists tended to give it
another connotation; i.e., amusement or
relaxation.

In much the same way has recreation
been misused to indicate professional
practice or participation in certain ac-
tivities. The essence and nature of rec-
reation has no relation to practice. It is
simply a state-of—being. So highly per-
sonalized is this state that only the indi-
vidual, reacting to environmental stim-
uli or Specific activity, can achieve the
degree of absorption needed for recrea-
tion to occur. The practitioner does
not, never has, and never will be able
to provide recreation for the partici-
pant. All the practitioner can do is pro-
vide particular experiences and facili-
ties, services, whereby the individual
may finally attain recreation. The prac-
titioner who thus supplies recreation
service is employed in the field of rec-
reation service and is, in fact, a recrea—
tionist.

Latin transliteration plus faulty the-
orizing are responsible for the poor
present-day use of recreation. Literally,
recreation means to reproduce or re-
build rather than restore or recuperate.
It certainly does not carry any connota-
tion of amusement or relaxation. These
latter ideas along with the inclusion of
leisure as a qualifying aspect of activity
is a product of late nineteenth and early
twentieth century reasoning“.

SEPTEMBER 1961

If critics of the term recreationth are
correct in their assumption that ist “is
frowned upon unless it is added to some
science, art, or branch of knowledge
originally expressed by a word of
Greek formation,” then the term recrea-
tionist, as has been indicated, is the
designation by which practitioners and
students of various phases of recrea-
tional service, as well as the nature of
recreation itself, should be known.
Surely there is enough esoteric knowl-
edge concerning recreation service re-
search and theory to qualify it as a sci-
ence to the same extent that education,
psychotherapy, the ministry, and pub-
lic administration qualify as social sci-
ences. If the practice of recreation lead-
ership is nothing else, it is an art.—

And a hnal word from Dan Saults,

assistant director of the Missouri Con-
servation Commission, in his column in
the Missouri Conservationist of N ovem-

ber 1960:

HERE WE co AGAIN, trying to com-
municate when so many of us don’t
mean the same thing by certain words.
Let’s take another crack at determining
how to talk to each other by now wrest-
ling with that catch-all word: recrea-
tion.

About the simplest of the dictionary
definitions here is some help: A recrea-
ting; refreshment of strength and
spirit; diversion or a mode of diversion.
This would seem to cover almost every-
thing from praying to preying, from
dice-shooting to duck-shooting, from
opium smoking to carp smoking . . . or
from one man’s meat to anotller’s
poison. . . .

We are also hearing much about “rec-
reation agencies”-—-but does this mean
a zoo board, a playground associatiOn,
or a state athletic commission? Well,
it means all of them, plus the state park
board, the conservation commission,
and a host of other organizations. Rec-
reation has come to have more con-
fused meanings than even conservation.

If we get some real meanings, maybe
we can clear up our thinking. We can
even understand that no department of
government can supply recreation —

just an opportunity. #

those that had established comprehen-
sive services. The findings from such a
study might serve as sources of inSpira-
tion and direction to greater program
variety for other recreation profes-
sionals.

As a result of the evaluation process
it became apparent that an awareness
of program deficiencies exists among
many professional recreation person-
nel. Despite the much-discussed cul-
tural upsurge in the country and the
swiftly growing needs of various age
and interest groups, not enough is ac-
tually being accomplished in this area
of program enrichment. Throughout
the course of interviews, visits, and dis-
cussions, it was kept in mind that the
experiences and ideas of specialists and
experts would be of value to those lead-
ers who at present are either hesitant

or unaware of the program contribu-
tions which the cultural arts have made
and can make to today’s programs.

It was apparent from only a few pro-
grams studied—but with conclusions
supported by a large body of writers—
that program deficiencies and unsatis-
fied recreation needs exist side by side
today. The major stumbling block in
the path of greater development of pro-
grams, taking into consideration art,
drama, dance, and music for all age
groups, seemed to be lack of recogni-
tion of their value by persons in posi-
tions of civic authority. They often in-
fluence the allocation of financial sup-
port to recreation programs and need
to be convinced that such programs can
and should consist of more than physi-
cal recreation. An indictment of pres-
ent administrators and leaders was also
made by some who had found them still
promoting unimaginative and stereo-
typed programs differing very little
from those offered in 1920-r-or even

earlier.
An additional factor. almost unani-

mously considered a deterrent, was lack
of practical knowledge on the part of
leaders of methods useful to the crea-
tion of imaginative and varied program
material. Leaders simply did not know
how to get other than physical-activity
or game-type programs started. These
leaders assume that if no one asks for
cultural activities, they are not wanted.

group has become a permanent organ-

city’s full financial support.

In another community, local people
interested in music founded a civic mu-
sic group with a local artist and teacher
as conductor. A request for aid from
the city council, through the recreation
director, resulted in a modest budget
covering basic expenses. Later this de-
veloped into the Santa Monica Sym-
phony Orchestra, a totally city-spon-
sored and recreation department-ad-
ministered organization. The initial
program has grown into a full-sized
community symphony orchestra.

Also in Santa Monica, an arts and

.crafts program now regularly spon-

sored by the city recreation department
and offering a year round program of
ceramics, china painting, porcelain,
modeling, lampshade making, and leath-
ercraft grew out of personal and tele-
phoned requests by the local citizens for
crafts activities. A dance program is
still another department.

Pasadena hired a half-time dance su-
pervisor for its drama division fourteen
years ago. Now it has a dance division
carrying out a teaching program in
twenty-seven elementary schools, a
dance workshop, and ballroom dance
instruction at five junior-high schools.
Other adult activities including square
and ballroom dancing are sponsored
weekly. A summer program has also
been developed, coordinating with the
drama division and other community

events.

SLIDE-A-PUK

New game proves
popular with college-age players

E. A. Sclloler and Clint Strong

PHYSICAL EDUCATORS and recreation group leaders are

constantly on the lookout for an activity which lends
itself to a variety of purposes. Such an activity is Slide-A-
Puk. The game, also called Flora Hockey, is an adaptation
of regular ice hockey to a concrete, wood, or tiled surface
setting.

Slide-A-Puk has been introduced in the physical-education
skills program at the State University of Iowa for use with
the physical-conditioning classes and in the home-recreation
games classes. It offers a challenging and vigorous activity
in which the students painlessly enjoy participation.

As a conditioning activity it provides the exercise for the
development of the several aspects of fitness: endurance,
skill, speed, agility, and strength. Being skilled or having
had previous experience in ice hockey is no prerequisite for
playing—and enjoying—Slide-A-Puk.
game and, though not a dangerous affair, presents occa-
sional body contact in the form of body checks.

The game is also an excellent recreation activity. It can
be utilized by hockey enthusiasts as a means of keeping in
touch with the game as they grow older. Slide-A-Puk can
be played by both sexes and makes an excellent co-recrea-
tion activity. It is also something that the whole family can
play together. The game can be played with teams (six to
a side) or as singles and doubles (two to four players).
There are no set dimensions for the area; this can be adapted

The equipment is specially designed for this game and is
available from the Bathurst Manufacturing Company, 872
Bathurst Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The puck is a
regulation hockey puck with ball bearings inserted in it,
which allows a swift, sliding mobility. The hockey sticks
are lighter than ice-hockey sticks and the blade is shorter
except for the goalie’s stick. The blades of the sticks are
taped so as to offer protection to the floor. Each stick is
supplied with a rubber safety butt. The sticks can be made
by hand using three-quarter-inch plywood with a regular
hockey stick as a pattern. If this is done, the entire stick
should be wrapped in adhesive tape to protect the floors and
prevent splintering. The goals can be similar to those used

The goals should be low so as to be sure the puck will not
be lifted above the knee.

Rules and Points of Play

1. The game is played the same as regular ice hockey
with the exception of a few rules.

2. The game is played with six players on a team or less,
according to the space available.

3. Players must not lift sticks above the knees; if they do
they are given a two-minute penalty.

4. The goal keeper is the only player allowed inside the
goal crease; any other player inside the goal crease is given
a two-minute penalty.

5. The defensemen should not cross the center line unless
in possession of the puck. When a defenseman loses the puck
he must return to his side of the center line. If he does not
return within a reasonable time, he is given a two-minute

penalty.
6. The puck shall not be shot from any distance from the

goal; the puck is to be taken by the player to the goal to
try to draw the goal keeper out of position.

7. Another rule for protection of walls is to have a line
out from the walls and around the back of the goals; as soon
as the puck goes over the line play is called and the puck is
faced off inside of the rule where the puck went over the line.

8. If the puck goes over the line at the back of the goal

“This is more fun than TV, besides, you
are learning something.”

THESE ARE typi-

cal remarks
overheard at the
recreation depart-
ment’s nature cen-
ter in Austin,
Texas. Taking nat-
ural science out of
books and into the everyday experi-
ences of children is being done in all
the activity groups of the Austin Na-
ture Center. There are groups in as-
tronomy, archeology, plants, animals,
earth sciences, and meteorology. These
interest groups meet for one-and-a-half
hours each week with trained leadership
and give the children firsthand encoun-
ters with natural phenomena and guid-
ance in the recognition and classifica-
tion of specimens. That the children
enjoy discovering the world of nature

 

is proven by their regular attendance
at all of the sessions.

Let’s go on an imaginary field trip
with one of the groups. Let’s accompany
the animal group to the Bee Creek Na-
ture Trail above Tom Miller Dam on
Lake Austin. The children meet at the
nature center where they are trans-
ported in a group to the trail by volun-
teers. They pile out of the cars at the
trail, clutching insect nets, killing jars,
snake loops, and other equipment they
built at their last meeting. They are as
frisky as young puppies. The air is spicy
with the smell of sunshine on the cedar
brakes.

The leader briefs them on the safety
precautions to be taken and the wildlife
they may expect to see. As the children
walk along the stony roadway, the im-
portance of trees and grasses as food
and cover for the animals is pointed out.

Where the hillside has washed away,
erosion is discussed, and the children
talk about ways to keep this from hap-
pening. The children decide that none
of the animal specimens will be killed
unless needed for the collection at the
nature center. As they see an animal,
a note is made of it. They know that
they can record this find with a full
classification at the next session at the
center, using reference books as guides.

As the group nears the water, a dead
rufous-sided towhee is‘found floating
at the water’s edge. As they fish him ot,

 

At the end of ten sessions one group

each child has something to add about
where this bird normally lives, what
might have killed him, and what his
natural enemies are. The leader prom-
ises that at the next session he will do
a skin-mount demonstration for them
with this bird. As the hour draws to a
close, the children are taken back to the
nature center where their parents are
waiting for them, and the next group
awaits its turn to “go adventuring with
nature.”

This informal learning in an atmos-
phere of recreation is typical of all these
groups. Each one starts out with a spe-
cial interest, but trained leadership
guides them in the broad program of
conservation education and the scien-
tific method for finding facts. Field

trips, lectures, movies, and classification
sessions take them, step by step, through
ten sessions so that at the end they have
a collection or group project to gauge
their accomplishment. For example, the
animal group at the end of ten sessions
was ready to construct a family tree for
the animal kingdom, using preserved
specimens of each group to show their
relationships.

THE AUSTIN NATURE CENTER pro-
gram did not just happen acciden-
tally, but was a result of the desire of
the Austin Recreation Department to
expand its nature activities plus the as-
sistance given by a group of dedicated
volunteers. Several months before the
children were invited, meetings were
held by the staff of the recreation de-
partment with M. T. McLean and Mar:
garet Louise Hill. These two volunteers
have training and experience both as
naturalists and as teachers; both had
materials and collections which they do-
nated to the center to start exhibits.

The “why, what, where, when” of the
program was evolved in several meet-
ings; and, with the cooperation of the
Austin public schools, a survey was
taken of the faculties of the elementary
schools as an indication of interest and
need. From the results of this survey,
the recreation department planned for
three groups: astronomy, plants and
animals, and earth sciences. The bud-
get for this program was inadequate to
hire scientifically trained personnel, so
it was decided to contact amateur and
scientific societies to sponsor these
groups and send volunteer resource per-
sons from their organizations to meet
with the children. The Travis Audubon
Society endorsed and sponsored the
plants and animals group; the Austin
Gem and Mineral Society, the earth-
science group; and the Forty Acres
Astronomy Club, the astronomy group.
Other groups who endorsed the pro-
gram and gave assistance were the As-
sociation of Childhood Education;
Delta Kappa Gamma, an honorary
teacher’s sorority; Science Materials

Center; and various science depart-
ments of the University of Texas; and
the Texas Game and Fish Commission.
The assistance given by the Texas Game
and Fish Commission personnel and the
materials furnished the center by the
information and education division of
that organization have been particu-
larly pertinent and helpful. The recrea-
tion department acted as a coordinator
for all these volunteers and assumed the
actual week-by-week leadership of the
groups. It also promoted the total pro-
gram, keeping records and providing
materials and facilities.

No matter how informal the weekly
sessions may seem to the participant,
the key to success lies in careful plan-
ning and coordination of subject mat-
ter with the volunteer resource special-
ists regarding the location of the ses-
sion, and the physical materials to be
seen, handled, and discussed. Repre-
sentatives of each cooperating society
met with the recreation department
staff, Miss Hill, and Mr. McLean, and
an outline was developed for all ten ses-
sions with each interest group.

THE FIRST GROUPS were launched in
the spring of 1960. The elementary
teachers had provided the names of sci-
ence-minded children in the fourth,

fifth, and sixth grades, and these chil-
dren were sent invitations. Within a
week all groups were full and enroll-
ment had to cease since the program
had room for only sixty-five children.
This first session of ten weeks, which
was used as an experiment, was a re-
sounding success in view of attendance,
participant interest, and volunteer co-
operation. The recreation department
decided to make this a permanent part
of its program.

In the fall of 1960, interest was so
great it was necessary to open two
groups in astronomy and earth science,
and a general-science group for ad-
vanced and junior-high children. Even
though 120 children enrolled, forty
were left on a waiting list. Two addi-
tional organizations offered their serv-
ices as sponsors: the Archeological
Club of the University of Texas and the
American Meteorological Society, UT
Student Branch. The Girl Scouts asked
to be included in the program as units,
and space in the program has been pro-
vided for four such groups. Some three
hundred children met last spring.

One important factor to the success
of the program has been the assistance
of the faculty and students of the Uni-
versity of Texas, either as volunteers or
as part-time employees of the recreation

department. As the representatives of
the sponsoring groups, volunteers, and
university people met with the recrea-
tion-department staff to plan the future
of the program, the need for expanded
housing and a permanent organization
became evident. Beverly S. Sheffield,
director of recreation, was named chair-
man of a steering committee. Concrete
steps are being taken to give the nature
center permanence and additional finan-
cial support from the community.

A source of inspiration, information,
and encouragement has been the Nature
Centers for Young America, Inc. This
organization has as its objectives the
creation among leadership groups in
American cities of an awareness of the
need of experiences with nature and the
outdoors, the translation of this aware-
ness into action leading to the preserva-
tion of natural areas of land, and the
assistance in the development of facili-
ties for meaningful outdoor educational
programs. Its director of operations,
John Ripley Forbes, has made two visits
to Austin and has given us guidance and
assistance in planning for the future.

Austin is proud to take its place
among the cities and towns across the
United States which are realizing and
meeting the needs of junior citizens to
know and enjoy the world of nature. #

SUMMIT __
CONFERENCE

National Recreation Association’s Nation-
al Advisory Council and Board of Direc-
tors hold joint meetings to discuss achieve-
ments, trends, and needs in recreation field.

HE FIRST joint meeting of the National Recreation As-
T sociation’s National Advisory Council and Board of

Directors was held in New York City at NRA head-
quarters on May 22-24, 1961. Twelve Board members and
twelve Council members attended.

James H. Evans, chairman of the Board, expressed the
Board’s appreciation of the willingness of the Council mem-
bers to come to New York to meet with the Board to discuss
the achievements, trends, and needs in the field of recreation
and to make recommendations to the Board on ways and
means by which the NRA could increase its coverage and
effectiveness in serving the field. Joseph Prendergast,
NRA’s executive director, in his opening remarks described
the present crises facing recreation and the tremendous 0p-
portunities and responsibilities which the current social and
economic situation of the nation present to the recreation
movement. He expressed the opinion that the situation was
not now being adequately met.

Thomas W. Lantz, Council chairman, chaired the joint
meeting and expressed the Council’s appreciation of the op-
portunity of sitting down with the Board in a joint meeting
--—a significant first in the relationship of the Association
with the field. The heads of the Association’s headquarters
services reported briefly to the Council on current activities
and the Council heard reports and recommendations from
representatives of several district and national advisory
committees. Among the matters on which the Council ad-
vised the Board were:

1. The changes in the concept of recreation under mod-
ern social conditions and the need for having any public
interpretation program based on sound current concepts.

2. The need for the Association to have additional staff
and resources and guidance by the recreation profession
for any future program of public interpretation.

3. The growing importance of the community recreation
program, the strengthening of cooperative relationships be
tween the NRA and local programs, the role of the Asso-

Among those present at the joint Board and Council meeting
were, clockwise, from front center: Arthur Williams, Bev-

erly Sheffield, Sanger P. Robertson, Paul Boehm, Ernest

Craner, Susan M. Lee, Z. Carol Pulcifer, Robert Crawford,
F. Gregg Bemis, Edward L. Bernays, Joseph Prendergast,

ciation on the district and national levels, the effective mo-
bilization of the Association and the professionals in the
field in the various program areas, and the implementation
of good program ideas through demonstrations, exhibits,
and conferences.

4. The need for the appointment of a full-time director
of training by the Association to study the present training
needs of the field, to determine what the Association should
do to meet these needs, and to plan and conduct an Associa-
tion training program to meet its responsibility in this field,
including the extension of the National Institutes of Train-
ing being held in connection with the National Recreation
Congresses, and the development of a national list of com-
petent resource people to be used in district and local con-
ferences and workshops.

5. The future relationships of the Association with the
American Recreation Society, the American Institute of
Park Executives, the Federation of National Professional
Organizations for Recreation, and other national or-
ganizations, particularly in the areas of national and dis-
trict conferences; the accreditation of recreation courses
and curricula; the national certification and registration of
recreation personnel; the development of a national recrea-
tion research center; and international matters.

6. The need for a study of ways and means of increasing
the general financial support of the Association and a re-
evaluation of the Association’s service fees and charges.

7. The desirability of having an appropriate member of
the Council attend Board meetings when special considera-
tion is given to a particular area of service and the relation-
ship of a particular Board member with an advisory com-
mittee of special interest to that Board member.

8. The advisability of making such a joint meeting of the
Council and Board an annual affair and the possibility of a
follow-up meeting of the two groups at the coming National

Recreation Congress in Detroit. #1:

Spotlight on Board Members

0 The first Southeastern Kansas Recre-
ation Commissioners meeting was held
in Independence this spring to bring
together board members to discuss com-
mon recreation problems and responsi-
bilities. Sponsored by the Independence
Recreation Commission, the Recreation
Consultant Service of the University of
Kansas, and National Recreation Asso-
ciation District Representative Robert
L. Black, it was attended by some twenty
interested persons.

Southeastern Kansas was chosen for
this first get-together because it has the
greatest concentration of cities with
tax-supported recreation programs in
the state. The program was well-bal-
anced and interesting, according to ob-
servations at the iinal session. Larry
Heeb, state recreation consultant, dis-
cussed the basic laws under which a
commission operates, indicating its
limitations and the restrictions imposed
upon it, and the need for vigilance on

the part of board members as to their

responsibilities to the community. Don
J olley, superintendent of recreation in
Parsons, gave an excellent presentation
of “The Recreation Commission as the
Superintendent Sees It,” and Mr. Black
told of recreation services communities
might draw on, such as NRA, state or-
ganizations, and so on. A similar ses-
sion for board members in Northeast
Kansas is being planned for late fall or
early spring.

0 A board-member workshop held re-
cently at Wayne State University, De-
troit, Michigan, had representatives
from twenty-four metropolitan commu-
nities in the Detroit area. The workshop
was divided into four groups. Two
groups represented policy boards; one
group, advisory boards or committees;
the fourth was composed of recreation
executives. The meeting was sponsored
by three area groups, the university,
and the National Recreation Associa-
tion.

The Fight Goes On

In Omaha, where new roads menace
four city parks, a bitter battle is raging
over park preservation. The Park and
Recreation Board has unanimously ap-
proved resolutions aimed at guarding
the parks. Mrs. Rachel K. Gallagher.
National Recreation Association Board
member and former chairman of the
Omaha Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion, has added her own strong protest
to that of the Park and Recreation
Board. Mrs. Gallagher is a veteran of
many frays on park conservation.

RECREATION and the
CITY PLANNING PROCESS

Never has the need for recreation facilities and services been greater

Neno John Spagna

AVE YOU TAKEN a good look at your city’s recreation
program lately? Does it fulfill your city’s needs . . .

for today and tomorrow? These questions are being
asked throughout America: by the people, by the commu-
nity administrators, by the recreation directors, and by the

professional city planners.

Never before has there been such a demand for public
recreation facilities as today. Future need will be even
greater. By 1980 eighty percent of our total population or
about 209,000,000 persons will be living in urban areas.
The task of providing a well-balanced, all-age range recre-
ation program will be a gargantuan task requiring all of the
combined skill and imagination of the recreation executives

and the city planners.

The recreation administrator should keep two things in
mind: that the modern city planner is definitely interested
in participating with recreation authorities as active partners
in the development of the community’s recreation needs and

that the city’s planning department can be an invaluable

source of information and technical data regarding the cur-
rent and long-range development of recreation facilities.

Relationship of Recreation. and the Planning Function”-
The city planner is concerned with the organization of a
comprehensive system of recreation sites in proper relation
to all the other elements comprising the city. He is not nor-
mally responsible for the interior design of the areas, the
facilities that go into them, or the actual scheduling of pro-
grams and events. His chief concern is to take appropriate
measures, after thorough studies and consultation with rec-
reation and school authorities to see that properly located
sites are obtained and available when the recreation depart-
ment is ready to move into a new neighborhood and develop
a recreation facility. Although not a trained site planner.
the city planner may. upon request, furnish preliminary
drawings and layouts for the internal development and land-
scaping. In Hollywood, Florida, all preliminary recreation
area site plans are drawn up by the planning department in
cooperation with the advice of the recreation supervisor and
city engineer. The final engineering drawings are made by

the engineering department.

365

Research and Study—The city planning department also
maintains accurate files and records concerning various as-
pects of the community character as well as pertaining to
the city and its government. Its staff is made up of per-
sonnel expert in gathering information, conducting surveys,
and assembling material into report form. The city planner
and his staff have the equipment and facilities for assisting
the recreation director or planner in compiling recommen-
dations for a long-range recreation plan that will allow for
future expansion and needs.

Populations and Population F orecasts—The location and
extent of future recreation facilities depend to a great degree
on the growth of the city. Using past figures, current growth
trends, and projected deveIOpment plans, the city planner
can estimate accurately where the future growth of the city
is most likely to occur. Newly developed areas will require
new recreation facilities. By the same token, it is equally

 

Hollywood commissioners ponder ten-year recreation plan.

important for the recreation department to be aware of
shifting populations and any change in a district’s age char-
acter. This information permits the closing of a facility in
cases where its operation is no longer warranted and it
allows modification of the program and facility to fit the
changing age group use.

The planning department maintains up-to-date informa-
tion on population statistics. By utilizing this information,
the recreation director can anticipate the public need, there-
by providing advance planning and construction.

Basic Studies Data—Basic studies data cover pOpulation
characteristics including composition, occupation, and eth-
nic derivation; history of the community; an inventory of
the community’s physical, social, and economic assets; an
appraisal of the community’s natural resources; commercial
and industrial potential; land-use maps; zoning regulations;
housing conditions; and special studies, such as pr0posed
civic centers, marina facilities, transit and transportation
plans or any other special condition peculiar to the com-
munity. It is an X-ray of the myriad organs that make the
city tick.

Base Maps, Graphs, Charts—The planning department has
available base maps of the city. The recreation executive
can use these to illustrate a whole range of subject matter—
location of existing or proposed recreation areas, popula-
tion densities, natural physical barriers such as rivers, rail-
roads, or limited access highways which would act as natural
district boundaries and so on. Graphs and charts are also
available, indicating school enrollment as well as many other

366

aspects of the changing community. These can be of great
help to the recreation director in adjusting his programs
and facilities to seasonal and cyclical peak demands.

Most modern city planning departments now maintain
aerial photographs of the community. By referring to the
photos, the recreation director can eliminate time-consum-
ing field inspections or obtain a bird’s-eye view of the area
around an existing or proposed recreation facility.

Financing Future Recreation Needs—When it comes to
financing future recreation needs, the city planner can be
of tremendous assistance. The task of organizing, adminis-
tering, and updating the long-range capital improvement
plan is now becoming an administrative function of the
planning department in many cities. The city planner
should also be called upon to assist the recreation depart-
ment in assembling and compiling the necessary data needed
for an intelligent long-range financial timetable for acquisi-
tion of lands and capital improvements of future facilities.

Schools—uActive Partners in Recreation—Public schools
play an important part in a city recreation program. Rec-
reation, planning, and school officials should c00perate in
locating and developing school sites that will encourage
maximum utilization of recreation facilities—during School
hours, after school hours, and during the weekend and sum-
mer vacation periods. .

In Florida, the public schools are operated by a county
board of public instruction independent of the municipal
governments located within its boundaries. The city of H01-
lywood has a program whereby the school board leases part
of each school site to the city for a token fee of one dollar
a year, in exchange for which the city puts in the recrea-
tion facility and maintains and operates it during the
school’s off-hours.

By working closely with the school officials, the city of
Hollywood has been able to locate recreation facilities in
neighborhoods which otherwise would not have had any
available land for this purpose. This c00perating program
with the school board has saved the city thousands of dol-
lars in land-acquisition costs, eliminated costly duplications
of equipment and buildings, and has saved many tax dollars
in the cost of operation and supervision. Most important
of all, perhaps, is that the city was able to work with the
school board in providing children with a recreation area
which would otherwise have been impossible.

As the administrator of the community’s recreation func-
tion, the recreation executive is called upon to organize and
supervise an efficient and up-to-date recreation program.
Such a task, in light of the growing demands, is becoming
more difficult with each passing day. Cooperation between
the three departments is essential in order to promote and
develop an orderly, adequate, enduring recreation program.

Members of recreation commissions, school boards, and
planning commissions, in communities where the three ex-
ist, should sit down together in the planning and develop-.
ment of their city’s recreation program. It is hoped that
recreation authorities will freely and fully utilize the assist-
ance and facilities of their planning department toward
the betterment of the recreation program as well as toward
the overall community betterment. # in;

RECREATION

 

The recreation executive—Model 1970-—

as arrived at through the discussions of individuals from

different points of view, some from different occupations

MEN TO MATCH OUR MOUNTAINS

Norman P. Miller
0 VER THE facade

of the court-
house in Sacramen-
to, California,
etched in square
granite blocks, is

 

the phrase “Bring
Me Men To Match
My Mountains.” One has only to look
at the towering, rugged mountains
of the area to know what was meant—
big men, with strength, ruggedness,
power, beauty, resources, kindness, vi-
sion, leadership in its fullest sense. So
it is with the recreation movement, as
we face the next ten to twenty years.
We need men to match our mountains
-——men that have the foresight, skills,
power, and capacity to ensure recrea-
tion achieving its goals and at the same
time fulfilling its highest purpose
through its contributions to human wel-
fare.

What are the mountains in recrea-
tion’s future? The peaks loom large
before us—increasing leisure, booming
population, decreasing land and open
space, increasing competition for land
areas by a wider range of users, increas-
ing demand for both quality and quan-
tity in recreation program services, just
to mention five of the more prominent
ones. Stretched in between are several
ranges of trends and concerns with

which the recreation executive will be

faced by 1970. Some of these are:

0 Increasing competition for the com-
munity tax dollar will limit the amount
of public funds available for recreation.
0 Increasing importance attached to
recreation will bring better comprehen-
sion of its sc0pe and major careers.

 

.—

DR. MILLER is associate professor of
physical education at the University of
California in Los Angeles.

SEPTEMBER 1961

There will be decreasing need to sell
recreation to the individual as a result
of improved education for leisure, but
an increasing need to sell recreation to
special groups and individuals such as
taxpayers’ associations, city councils,
and other vested interest groups with
whom recreation may be in competition
for the tax dollar and land areas.

0 Recreation leaders will no longer
need to consider themselves mission-
aries and should stand ready to be ac-
cepted in proper perspective with other
services. There will need to be relative
priorities in relation to other service
groups, but these will vary in terms of
time, place, and emphasis.

0 Relationships with parks will con-
tinue to improve and broaden as more
coordinated use is established.

0 The lines between informal educa-
tion, adult education, and recreation,
although still not clearly defined, will
be more precisely delineated and clari-
fication, particularly in terms of com-
mon concerns and duplication of ef-
forts, will occur.

0 The vieWpoint of where the recrea-
tion program is focused in the commu-
nity will be shifted. It will not be iden-
tified as primarily on playgrounds or in
community centers, but in the total
community on a very wide basis. The
areas and facilities belonging to public
agencies will serve as referral and coun-
seling centers for total leisure services
and resources.

0 Recreation will shift to a more in-
trinsic approach with greater emphasis
upon the appeal or value of participa-
tion to the individual, rather than the
mass or group approach. This will cre-
ate the need for greater concern for
practical politics and more effective use
of democratic processes in the accom-
plishment 0f the common good. while

preserving opportunity for individual
expression.

0 The trend of utilizing a specialist
class for management in many areas of

government and industry will spread to
recreation.

WHAT KIND or MAN will it require
to meet these challenges, pres-
sures, and concerns? The recreation
executive—Model 1970—if he is to
match mountains will need:

1. A concept of function regarding
the place of recreation in the lives of
people and its meaning as a guide in
his administrative operations.

2. A breadth of perspective permit-
ting him to see his function in relation
to the functions of other public officials,
such as the planner, school executive.
municipal fiscal officer, and others.

3. A better understanding of the be-
havior and motivations of humans and
the ability to translate this knowledge
and understanding into more effective
programs.

4. A broad background in the liberal
arts with cultural understanding such
as will permit appreciation of the un-
usual interests and desires people have
in seeking personal recreation.

5. Skill in the development of con-
sultant services that help people find
their recreation, particularly in pro-
gram areas which serve individual
needs and interests. Ability to organize
total community resources for recrea-
tion and leisure. and in working with
organizations to enhance their under-
standing of their recreational functions.

6. Skill in management and admin-
istration and the utilization of methods
employed by business and other serv-
ices. with particular emphasis upon the
utilization of management specialists in
order to free the recreation executive
for creative planning and direction.

Civilization has always, through-

—REV. JOSEPH SIZOO

 

Graduate Education Sub-Committee al-
tered its approach. Rather than work
on curriculum problems directly, it was
felt it would be interesting and fruitful
to attempt a formulation of what the
recreation executive should be like in
the year 1970. The thought was that if
the 1970 concerns and pressures of the
executive could be defined and de-
scribed, then the competencies and

skills needed could be identified. It was
felt this approach might furnish a guide

‘or framework for examining graduate

education in recreation as to its effec-
tiveness and direction. This approach
was predicated, of course, on two pre-
mises: that graduate education should
be directed primarily toward prepara-
tion of higher level leadership and
should not be geared necessarily and
solely to today’s needs and problems,
but more logically to those of tomor-
row.

0 THIS END Dr. Clifton Hutchins

SUCH MEN are not found everyday, T conducted a seminar at the Univer-

nor on every park bench. Rather
they are the result of patient, thorough
professional preparation, sound practi-
cal experience and inservice education,
the products of an ever-expanding series
of steps, contacts, and relationships in
the recreation field. The National Rec-
reation Association’s National Advisory
Committee on Recruitment, Training,
and Placement of Recreation Personnel
has devoted considerable time and
thought during the past few years to
improving the ways and means for de-
veloping such leadership. It has been
a particular concern of its Undergradu-
ate and Graduate Education Sub-Com-
mittees to continuously evaluate the
professional preparation of recreation
leaders in the effort to improve such
preparation—to better develop men to
match recreation’s mountains.
Normally the work of the Graduate
Education Sub-Committee has been di-
rected to specific problems dealing with
curriculum, courses, etcetera, leading to
preparing executives. This past year the

sity of Wisconsin and the author one at

UCLA on the topic “The Recreation
Executive—"Model 1970.” Individuals
participating were drawn from several
different occupations, with representa—
tion from law, ministry, agriculture, ed-

With the

thought that the outcomes from the two

ucation, and recreation.

discussions might be interesting to
others besides the participants and the
committee members, the above brief
synthesis has been prepared.

Some readers may disagree with
parts of the above, some even with all
of it. This could be healthy. One point
appears salient, however. The basic
leadership need in this profession will
not be for the man who knows just to-
day. The paramount need is for the
man with the philosophy, with creative
ideas and concepts about recreation and
the profession, with the imagination
and will to equip himself to be the 1970
or ’80 or ’90 model executive—to be the
man to match the peaks in recreation’s

future. #

FROM BAD TO WORSE

W. C. Sutherland

THE ANNUAL student inventory con-
tinues to reveal an alarming situa-
tion. Professional recreation graduates
decreased again this year—from 598 in
1960 to 486 in 1961. This represents
a nineteen percent decrease in a situa-
tion that was already bad. The number
of schools reporting recreation gradu-
ates dropped once again, from forty-
six in 1960 to thirty-five in 1961—a loss
of twenty-four percent in the schools
reporting over the preceding year.
Although sixty-five colleges and uni-
versities are reporting major recreation
curriculum, only about fifty-three per-
cent are giving us any graduates. All
of the National Recreation Association’s
field districts show losses in the produc-
tion of professional graduates in 1961.

In last year’s report we indicated that
at the rate of production for the past
few years, five-sixths of the vacancies
expected to occur could not, under the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o How can we attract more and better

young people into our recreation cur-
riculums and subsequently into the rec-
reation profession?

0 How can we keep and develop them
once they have been enlisted?

REPORTS reaching the NRA Recrea-
tion Personnel Service indicate the
following reasons why the professional
recreation leaders are not recruiting:
There are those who are “uninspired”
and lacking in preparation; others are
just “too lazy”; and perhaps the largest
category of all are those who excuse
their lack of effort on the grounds of
being “too busy.”

It may be necessary for us to renew

our faith and strengthen our belief in
the power of recreation and its value in
the lives of people. Recreation leaders
tend to be lackadaisical about recruit-
ing. Certainly he who would spark an-
other must himself glow. Recruiting is
long range, it is important and urgent.
It is later than you think.

No excuse is valid for not recruiting
for one’s own profession. Let me share
with you a comment from Dr. Halle, a
well-known psychologist at Yale Uni-
versity: “In a world rushed to death,
long-range plans wait on the immediate.
What is urgent takes priority over what
is important. What is important then
gets attended to only when it becomes

urgent, which may be too late.” #

Campus Centers
Continued from Page 356

 

the novice bridge enthusiast, informal
lessons are offered on a weekly basis at a
nominal fee, while social dance lessons
are held three evenings per week. The
well-equipped craft shop offers informal
lessons in ceramics, jewelery-making,
and art metal work on Wednesday and
Friday evenings to round out the “class
schedule” for the Week.

In the union’s theater during a Wed-
nesday evening, a better-than-average
feature movie is shown at least twice—
always to a capacity house. Since Wed-
nesday evening is known as midweek
night, a casual dance is usually held by

candlelight in one of the multipurpose .

rooms of the building. If These informal
events close around 10:45 P.M. and are
free, as are the movies.

During the late afternoon of a week-
day, a Kaffee Klatsch (coffee hour) is
held in one of the lounges where stu-
dents and other members of the univer-
sity family can drop in and become
better acquainted. The entertainment
at these klatches may consist of a musi-
cal group or a professor speaking and
leading a discussion on a subject of
campus interest.

Of course, on a Friday or Saturday
evening one finds larger special events
taking place, such as a sophisticated
dance or the “International Fair.” The
latter includes displays by international
students and a exotic buffet of foreign
dishes. Finally, back to Sunday in the
early evening hours in one of the
lounges, a Twilight Musicale might be
underway with music majors playing
and telling about the finer points of a
selected program.

The above events are only a part of
the total picture. Students and univer-
sity staff eat in the cafeteria; the craft
shop is used on an informal basis, as
well as the browsing library, music
room, and lounges, while on the top
floor a myriad of meetings take place
by different student groups and depart-
ment-sponsored conferences. Physical
education classes use the bowling lanes:
art exhibits are continuously on display.

ated by approximately 250 full- and

include the director, program director,
food’s manager, house manager, and
business manager.

The program director’s responsibili-
ties include advising a student group
known as Ohio Union Activities, which
may be likened to the volunteer workers

_ in a group-work or recreation agency.

This group, some one hundred in num-
ber, renders unique and invaluable
service to the campus per se by sponsor-
ing various events. Organized along
committee-structure lines, some of its
members assist in framing program pol-
icies and providing leadership for dif-
ferent functions. Without this assistance
it would be practically impossible for
a college union to provide the service
and activities it gives.

At the same time, the professional
staff trains student volunteers in tech-
niques of good committee work and
good programing, and assists in point-
ing out some of the fundamental princi-
ples of group work. The carry-over
value for the student volunteers should
be of importance to community agen-
cies after graduation. For along with
the opportunity for a student to use his
initiative and gain some recognition on
campus comes the realization that com-
munity service through meeting recrea-
tion needs and interests is a vital con-
cern in today’s society. It is not un-
common for some of these volunteers to
prepare for careers in the leisure-time
field after experiences in extra-curricu-
lar activities sponsored by college
unions.

TODAY, campus community centers
are growing and expanding at a
healthy rate. With over four hundred
such unions in existence and others
under construction or in the planning
stage, the positive influence of such
agencies is being felt as never before.
Unions are excellent public relations
for any institution. Visitors, as well as
prospective students, are usually guided
to the union as one of the campus show-
places. Beyond this, it is the spot where
the spirit and fellowship of the college\
and university can be united as no- A
where else on campus. It can be the
place where friends are made, coopera-
tion Hourishes, ideas begin, and the phi- ‘
losophy _of community services is en-

gendered. #

topnotch accountant. They live in a
nice house in the suburbs and employ
a full-time maid and cook. Karen
doesn’t do any housework, although
she’d like to. About two years ago she
got polio and is now a quadriplegic and
can only use her right hand and arm a

MARVIN LLOYD is a rather shy, thin,
twenty-three year old. He is majoring
in history at college and is very indus-
trious. He spends a good bit of his time
reading, taking many books home. He
lives with his aunt. He has his own
room, although he has never invited
anyone there. He never comes to any
of the student socials; in fact, he hardly
mixes with the other students at all.
Last month, in the middle of one class,
he got up, ran out of the room, and no
one has seen him since. Marvin is an
epileptic and is afraid of having a seiz-
ure in front of others.

These five people are not unique. The
US. Public Health Service estimates
that one out of seven people in the
United States at the present time is
chronically impaired, and by 1970 this
figure will rise to one out of six. All of
these people need some specialized rec-
reation service to enable them to take
advantage of the many resources for
recreation in our country. What are
these specialized recreation services?

\Vho should be responsible for them?
Where do they exist?

The last question is the easiest to
answer. There are practically none
available at the present time, for a vari-
ety of reasons. Most of these reasons
revolve, not around economics, 0r facil-
ities, or lack of staff, but around atti-
tudes of the public, of lawmakers, and
of recreation agencies.

LAWMAKERS have made a great deal

of money available for vocational
education and vocational rehabilitation
but have totally ignored the fact that
hundreds and thousands of handi-
capped people cannot be vocationally
rehabilitated because they have not had
sufhcient social interaction to be able to
pass the tests for vocational rehabilita-
tion training. Many public recreation
departments gear their services almost
exclusively for the typical rather than
the atypical person. Private and volun-
tary agencies, although free to do as
they please, in the main, seem to follow
the same pattern, making only slight
and more selective modifications in pro-
viding recreation service. Parents of
so-called normal children tend to keep
their children away from the “differ-
ent” child; other families hide that
member who is not “perfect.”

In a recent study conducted in twelve
different communities across the
United States, it was found that re-
sources, staff, and funds were available
to enable handicapped persons to uti-
lize community recreation resources.
The only thing preventing this was the
attitudes of the peOple who had the
authority to do something about it.

IT IS APPARENT that each community
needs a council on recreation for
handicapped people. This council may
serve a metropolitan area. a suburb. or
an entire county in more rural areas.
It would be made up of representatives
of recreation agencies, health agencies,
churches, fraternal organizations, and
so forth.

It would be this council's responsi-
bility to coordinate the resources in the
community so service can he made
available to handicapped persons. For
instance, the council undoubtedly would
have to raise funds for a specially
trained staff to work either in or with

371

existing agencies. The council would
make sure that all public buildings have
ramps as well as steps, so that the handi-
capped can also use them: that fire laws
are altered, or special seating provided
for the handicapped in theaters, and
the like; that the local board of educa-
tion sees that all children, regardless of
their health status, receive some recrea-
tion education. This would allow a
handicapped child to learn skills in ac-
tivities that he could do by himself, with
relatives, with friends, and with fellow
students, or outside the home. A pro-
gram such as this would give the handi-
capped child some resources to fall back
upon.

This program might be for mentally
retarded youngsters perhaps, or those
with cerebral palsy. It would teach so-
cial development, with the goal of ena-
bling these youngsters to eventually par-
ticipate in the normal community rec-
reation outlets and to attend school.
There may also be need for an ongoing,
Specialized program for those persons
who could not develop enough social
skill to mix effectively with others in
the community program; therefore they

would need specialized programs and
resources.

IT IS EYE-OPENING to see the changes

that occur in a community once a
council involved only with the recrea-
tion problems of these special groups is
activated. If the communities of the
five cases cited had a council scrutiniz-
ing the available recreation services and
demanding modifications be made to
enable handicapped persons to take ad-
vantage of them, then our polio house-
wife could go swimming. A railing
would have been installed inside the
local pool so she could hold on with her
good right hand. It is quite possible
that she could be a pretty active mem-
ber of a number of women’s groups,

serving even in an executive capacity. -

There are hundreds of games she could
play and crafts she could do, if only
someone would teach her. She could
even invite others over to her home for
a bridge game, if she knew that many
persons with only the use of one hand
use a card rack to hold the cards. Karen,
of course, needs a chance to talk with
a recreation counselor or to go to an

activities center to develop recreation
skills despite her limitations.

AS MEDICINE continues its advances

more people will be coming out of
the institutions and into the community,
and they have a right to live a full, rich
life, even as you and I. Recreation ther-
apists can widen their interests and suit
them to their handicaps. The schools,
centers, and playgrounds can teach
handicapped children social skills and
then make it possible for them to par-
ticipate with the well in group activities.
True rehabilitation means that the
handicapped should be taught to enjoy
their lives.

For the unfortunate few, either child
or adult, who cannot be socially inte-
grated, every community should have
a special-activity center to give them
whatever recreation possible. Every
hospital, nursing home, and welfare
home should have a recreation pro-
gram for the institutionalized.

You can save a man from death, but
if he doesn’t want to live again, or
doesn’t know how, then medicine has
failed its purpose. #

for fame and fortune!

Do the teens want a sizeable sum of money to complete a pet project?

They can raise it—from their do-it-yourself activities. Why not have a fair?

As WITH PARTIES, every attempt to
make a fair “different” and unusu-
al should be tried. Here, too, a central
theme will provide unity, rather than
the feeling of a miscellaneous collection
of little booths.

Try an Old English Fair, for instance.
It would be at its best outdoors, on a
bright summer day, but it need not be
limited to that. Indoors, in a big recre~
ation room or gym, it can be made at-
tractive, too—and with no fears about
weather changes. Even winter winds
could not affect its popularity.

Outdoors, long pennants in bright
colors—red, green, blue, purple—can
be strung from overhead wires or Hown
from standards; indoors, they could be
used to ornament otherwise bare walls.

ties, Edythe and Davie DeMarche, As-
sociation Press, 1958.

might be painted on them in contrasting
colors, with lions or leOpards rampant,
couchant, passant guardant (all illus-
trated in any good encyclopedia), bulls,
grifiins, dragons, or lilies, fleur-de-lis,
falcons, and crescents. Fashion huge
shields, and consult the heraldry books
at the library for proper blazonry. It’s
a fascinating subject in any case, and
some of the teenagers will find them-
selves with a new hobby.

Call the aisles at the fair “lanes” or
“roads,” and put up signs at their
“crossroads”: Petticoat Lane, where
you’ll find attractions that entice the
ladies—jewelry, fancy aprons, flowers,
and so on; To Banbury, somewhere
along which we ought to find a pastry
shop; Oxford Street, for books. hand-
tinted or illustrated maps, and other
learned objects; Ironmonger Alley, if
there is metalware of hammered alumi-
num and copper; To the Serf A action,

where services are sold—-—as we’ll ex-
plain later.

There are innumerable types of

booths from which the youngsters might
choose:
0 First and foremost for any teen
activity—a place to eat. This is Ye
Pastry Shoppe, in Old English lettering.
Waitresses—and other purveyors of
wares, as well—might be in folk dress.
At other booths the “ladies in attend-
ance” might wear the more courtly cos-
tumes. with high headpieces that re~
semble dunce caps. from the tOp of
which stream dainty scarves. (See those
library books on costumes.)

The menu? Bread and sausage I‘hot

ways}, buns lsweet rollsl. ice the tea.
if you like, for summer. Coffee might
be the “new Arabian drink” «1‘ we’ll
call it a smuggler-3 item and smuggle

it into the menu. Soft drinks are root
beer, and gingerale, with coke serving
as dark ale. Punch ought to cover any-
thing else.

Adjacent to the Pastry Shoppe would
be the Pastry Cooke’s Stall selling
candy of all kinds, pies and cakes to be
taken home, fruits—anything the teen-
agers have produced by themselves—
popcorn, tany apples, candied fruit and
peels.

That service booth, the Serf Auction,

prices quoted to cover the services.
Letter signs to advertise the different
“skills.”

The Sorcerer’s booth could tempt the
crowd to “have a likeness of one’s self
brought forth in one minute,” and the
sorcerer could take pictures with a cam-
era that develops the picture on the
spot. More than one of these on hand
would help do a record-breaking busi-
ness.

The Fortune Teller could be a gypsy
nearby, who reads the imaginary future
in cards, a glass, or silver ball, and is
very mysterious as she demands that
her “palm be crossed with silver.”
Someone with quick wit and a sense of
humor can do a fine ob here.

The jousting would be done with a
dart game; Jishing would cover the
familiar fishpond, where everyone gets
a prize on the end of his line;_bowling
on the green could be set up in a minia-
ture alley.

Booth for M ilady could display the
usual aprons, potholders, plastic mats,
and so forth. The teenagers should fea-
ture as much of their own handiwork
as possible: articles the boys and girls
have made of wood, such as magazine
racks, footstools; leatherwork—belts,
billfolds, bookcovers; knitwear—socks
and scarves, mittens or gloves; plastics
—clear plastic mats painted in designs
and trays; driftwood pieces collected at
the beach; graceful reeds and catkins
sprayed with gold or silver paint; ce-
ramics; water colors or oil paintings;
anything in handmade jewelry, such as
bracelets, necklaces, rings and pins of
wire, solid silver, or copper; cards or
stationery imprinted with linoleum
block; toys.

The list is endless, depending upon
the talents of the young people involved.
And there is no rule that bars help from
the talented adults in the community.
It’s a do-it-yourself fair open to one
and all.

Other themes for such a fair might be
a Maypole, set up in the center of the
“grounds” with streamers reaching out
to every booth; Harvest, with the corn-s
shocks, pumpkins, apples, and Indian
corn; Snow Queen’s Mart, with artifi-
cial snow and ice predominating, and
an “igloo” for one of the booths. Each
bright idea will suggest another, so go

to it! #

0 HARRY K. EBY, national director of
school relationships of the Boy Scouts
of America since 1947, and a profes-
sional leader in the movement since
1923, died in Princeton, New Jersey, in
August, at the age of sixty. One of his
major interests was to extend scouting
to include handicapped boys.

0 JAMES DIXON, JR., a member of the
National Council of the Boy Scouts of
America and of its uniform insignia
committee and editorial board, died in
Montclair, New Jersey, in July, at the
age of fifty-seven.

o ERNEST WALTMAN SIPPLE, a pioneer
in the operation of summer camps, died
in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, in Aug-
ust, at the age of eighty-nine. A high-
school science teacher for twenty-four
years, Mr. Sipple served as the first di-
rector of the first summer camp for the
Playground Association of Philadel-
phia a half century ago. He was also
the first director of the Camp Directors
Association of America. #

the larger picture, the long-range re-
sults which shape the future. If we are
concerned with what the recreation pro-
gram is doing for the individual be-

cause of the changing concept of lei-"

sure, we will have to take a look at our
American culture as a whole.

OUR COUNTRY can contribute a very
special, vital, and fresh type of
culture to the world. Out of our tradi-
tions and our great resources of artistic
and colorful contributions of many na-
tionalities, we have synthesized some of
the best from many peoples into a fresh
and vigorous, individual form. Its ex-
pression is to be seen just as strongly
in our architecture, dance, music, art,
and theater as in our athletic and indus-
trial achievements. The energy of a
hard-working people who have built a
country out of a wilderness and achieved
great material well-being has also found
expression in the realm of the arts.

Composers, painters, dramatists, and

writers are part of the voice of America r,.‘l

today. They are saying in rhythm, tone,
color, and line that when a free people
have finished their work they are able
to take up their play and promote their
way of life with equal vigor. #-

Exchange on Plans and Practices

for the large number of people who come into the parks.
Interpretive services, which are largely educational in na-
ture, should be expanded so that eventually they can meet
to an adequate degree the demands which the visiting public
place upon us. Here is an opportunity to present a conserva-
tion message to millions of people in a situation Where in-
spiring surroundings stimulate their interest in nature and
conservation principles. We must use it to the fullest extent
possible. . . .”

Also, according to a May release from the ofIice of the
Secretary, in a major move to stimulate expansion of the
nation’s public recreation facilities, state and local govern-
ments in the public land, states that agree to dedicate new
parks for use by all Americans will be able to purchase rec~
reation areas from the national land reserve for $2.50 an
acre, or lease them at a quarter per acre per year.

In the past, regulations required that state and local gov-
ernments pay as high as fifty percent of the fair market
value for recreation lands, and Secretary Udall asserted
that this had practically stopped the “wise practice” of sort-
ing out lands and of getting those suitable for state or local
parks into local control. During 1960 only 1,954 acres of

land were set aside for state or local parks under this pro- .

gram . . . a “very poor record” in light of the pressing need
to strengthen all of our park systems. #

Administration of Health, Physical
Education and Recreation for Schools,
Richard C. Havel and Emery W. Sey-
mour. Ronald Press, 15 East 26th
Street, New York 10. Pp. 440. $5.50.

While this is one of the most com-
plete and readable books on the subject,
it is conservative in tone and does not
suggest any radically new ideas or poli-
cies. This makes it excellent for a new-
comer to the field but of limited value
to those who live in this field daily.
However, two fine chapters, “Legal Lia-
bility” and “Administrative Organiza-
tion,” alone make the book worth scan-
ning. The bibliography is rich and
varied.

In its elemental approach, the book
touches upon relatively few of the mush-
rooming problems in today’s school-
recreation world. Little attention is
given to the infinite variety of settings
in which today’s schools are located or
to the many friction points which arise
when a “fireball” recreation administra-
tor is let loose in an otherwise staid
school operation. Thus, the book serves
better as a handbook of operation under
ideal conditions than as a comprehen-
sive picture of the field. It is better ori-
ented to the more formal operations of
physical education and health than to
the “play-by-ear” situations of many of
the new recreation programs—Joseph
E. Curtis, Commissioner of Recreation,

White Plains, New York.

New Church Programs with the
Aging, Elsie T. Culver. Association
Press, 291 Broadway, New York 17.
Pp. 152. $3.50.

Mrs. Culver presents a well-organized
set of objects and guidelines for church
leaders in meeting needs and interests
including spiritual, economic, health,
housing, and free-time. She points out
how the individual church can act inde-
pendently or cooperatively with other
churches and other community agen-
cies, government and voluntary. The
inclusion of a chapter on “Older People
Need Fun, Too” reflects the author’s
appreciation of the value of recreation
in its broad sense. One interesting sug-
gestion she makes is that participation
in clubs and other activities has much

386

to recommend it as this does not make
the older person’s social pattern coin-
cide with the retirement date—Arthur
Williams, associate executive director,
National Recreation Association.

How To Make Collages, John Lynch.
Viking Press, 625 Madison Avenue,
New York 22. Pp. 136, illustrated.
$4.95.

r

Collages are designs worked out with
bits of colored paper, fabric, and torn
scraps of odd materials, arranged in a
pleasing composition to make a perma-
nent picture. It is an old, old art, now
enjoying a well-deserved revival. The
author is the well-known artist and de-
signer whose mobiles, sculptures, and
paintings are in many private collec-
tions. He is also the author of three ex-
cellent books, How To Make Mobiles,
Mobile Design, and Metal Sculpture.

Mr. Lynch does not claim collage as
a great art; as he puts it, “however
subtle an idea or feeling may be ex-
pressed in collage, it must always re-
main in a minor key. There is no such
thing as a great collage in the same
sense that there is a great painting.
There is good collage and bad collage
within the limitations of the medium.
. . . Collage is the adopted child of the
art world. It is a waif, a gamin, and
this is one of its chief charms.” He de-
votes separate chapters on “How To
Make Collages of Cloth, Plastic, Wood
and Other Materials,” “Advertising
Collage,” and “Construction and
Boxes,” each chapter profusely illus-

trated.———V.M.

The rapid expansion of residential
development into suburban areas and

pearance of open space make essential
the wise plotting of areas so they can
be readily serviced with municipal fa-

sents the result of a study with special
reference to density control zoning,
planned community development and
clustering of houses to permit commu-
nity open space. Among the sections of
special interest to leaders of recreation
are those dealing with such topics as
public versus private park areas, legis-
lation governing open space, golf
courses in residential developments, and
the many community plans providing
for various types and amounts of rec-
reation areas.——G.D.B.

Working With Groups, Walter M.
Lifton. John Wiley & Sons, 440 Park
Avenue South, New York 16. Pp. 238.
$6.00.*

One might characterize the philoso-
phy and general content of this book by
quoting the author’s closing statement
that group work “need not lead to medi-
ocrity but rather can serve as the key
to unlock the potential for individual
happiness and growth.” Those agencies
in the recreation and leisure-time field
who conduct formal discussion groups
will find the author’s description of
group technique most illuminating.

The author, an educator, draws upon
his experience largely from a formal
educational setting. He describes the
use of group techniques and points out
that through the group the individual
may gain new insight into the potential
for himself through sharing individual
problems and insecurities with others
in a group setting; further, that through
the group individual solutions to prob-
lems may be found. When one knows
that others have similar problems and
insecurities this in itself, he says, often
provides the individual with new growth
and deve10pment potential.

The author omits mention of the
great contribution and pioneering ef-
forts of the social group worker and

' touches too briefly on the background

and education that one should have in§
order to competently work with indi- r
viduals in the group—JOHN COLLIER,
Pacific Southwest District representa-
tive, National Recreation Association.
