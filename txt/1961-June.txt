. . . I think [RECREATION Magazine] is
being improved by leaps and bounds.
Among the qualities I am most im-
pressed by are:

0 The modern outlook on develop-
ments in the field.

0 The recognition that recreation in-
volves more than the National Recrea-
tion Association, our own local depart-
ment activities, etcetera (don’t take this
wrong!) We’ve finally recognized the
broad scope of people’s recreation,
don’t you think?

0 The imaginative style and format.
It’s eye-catching, well-edited, beauti-
fully framed.

o The photos and art work are excel-
lent.

In short, I think you and the NRA
are to be congratulated for a topnotch
professional magazine.

I have read with considerable inter-

which have appeared during recent

' N o more olive green park benches for
St. Petersburg, Florida. New colors——
sunshine yellow, gulf blue, sandrift
brown, bay green, and ocean coral—
are adding exotic patches amid the
greenery. This paint-the-town-pastel
revamping is part of a project of the
Suncoast Advertising Club to alter the

face of St. Petersburg.

' If the playground equipment at
Alaska’s Elmendorf Air Force base is
splashy bright, it’s because the teen-
agers—forty of them—“organized a
paint-up project. The swings, slides,
teeters got a face lifting. Recreation
Director Gerald Pelton reports, “We
estimated fifty gallons of paint on the
equipment and twenty-five gallons on
the painters.”

 

° Meet the lady who splashed flowers
along New York City’s Park Avenue.
Mrs. Albert Lasker started a colorful
series of flower beds at her own ex-
pense on four Park Avenue blocks;
then, with the city’s permission, ex-
tended planting to twenty-two blocks.
Finally the city voted to take over the
project and spread it to other avenues,
using concrete tubs of colorful plant-
ings along sidewalks where necessary.
A number of private participants also
make contributions. The City Gardens
Club has presented its flI‘St citation to
Mrs. Lasker for her green-thumb activi-
ties on Park Avenue. Mrs. Lasker gave
the city another $17,000 this spring to
extend the plantings another mile along
the avenue.

$1,000,000 Park Bond Issue Wins in Greensboro, North Carolina

> NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE to finance
a massive outdoor recreation program
are being studied by the Department Of
the Interioruamong them a possible
one-cent tax on soft drinks or cigarettes.
Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall also
listed as other possibilities Of financing
the program: taxes on manufacturers
who benefit from federal parks and rec-
reation areas, a $2,000,000,000 bond is-
sue with the bonds to be retired by spe-
cial fees or taxes, and a direct fee to be
paid by those utilizing the federal areas.

> A “GREEN ACRES” BOND ISSUE of
$60,000,000 to purchase land for parks
and recreation was included in the
1961-62 budget message Of Governor
Robert Meyner of New Jersey, who said
the state is facing an open-space crisis.
He recommends that $45,000,000 Of the
bond issue he spent for acquisition of
land and $15,000,000 used on a match-
ing basis with counties and municipali-
ties for local purchase Of recreation
areas.

> THE AMERICAN MALE. According to
the New York Post, heart specialist Dr.
Paul Dudley White, who attended Presi-
dent Eisenhower, called the 1961 model
of the American man a flabby weakling
compared with his predecessor Of thirty
years ago. On a visit to Australia, Dr.
Dudley commented: “It is a great
effort for the out-Of-shape, calorie-laden
American male tO walk around a corner
these days. In 1930 it was nothing to
walk five miles a day.” Dr. White fur-
ther stated that a healthy man should
not put on weight after he turned
twenty-four.

JOSEPH PRENDERGAST, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
National Recreation Association, 8 West Eighth Street, New York City

HOW WE AMERICANS spend leisure time might seem tO have little bearing

on the strength Of our nation or the worth and prestige of our free
society. Yet we certainly cannot continue to thrive as a strong and vigorous
free people unless we understand and use creatively one of our greatest re-
sources—our leisure.

I FIND IT particularly encouraging during these times of world tension
that the National Recreation Association has chosen the theme “New Hori-
zons for Your Free Time” for the Observance of National Recreation Month.

FOR Us TODAY, opportunity for recreation is bounteous and ever-increas-
ing. Perhaps no other nation in the world is more consciously oriented
toward recreation, and in no other nation is such a favorable combination
of leisure time, income, and mobility coupled with such enormous recreation
resources, both existing and potential.

WE ACCEPT as one of our basic freedoms the right to enjoy our leisure
time as we please. We must also accept the responsibility inherent in that
freedom: the challenge which free time offers a free people. It is my sincere
belief that the moral fibre, mental health, and physical strength Of each of
us, contributing to the sum total of American greatness, is now and will be
derived in large measure from the creative use of our leisure. We have
enormous capacity, enormous power in recreation. LET US ENGAGE IN IT

WISELY, NOT WASTEFULLY.

} EARLY ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION to
create Point Reyes National Seashore
has been recommended by the Depart-
ment of the Interior. The proposed area
would embrace 53,000 acres on Califor-
nia’s Point Reyes peninsula in Marin
County, thirty miles north of San Fran-
cisco. Copies Of the Economic F easibil—
ity Study and of the Land Use Study of
the proposed Point Reyes seashore are
available from National Park Service
Offices in Washington, D. C., and San
Francisco.

The Interior Department also recom-
mended early enactment Of legislation
to create Padre Island National Sea-
shore in Texas, embracing the longest
undeveloped segment Of seashore in the
United States’ portion of the Gulf Of

Mexico.

) CONSOLIDATION Of park and recrea-
tion agencies continues. In New York,
Governor Nelson Rockefeller has signed
a bill abolishing the citizen boards that

90‘” 3 .jénnecly

have governed the Westchester County
park and recreation departments, au-
thorizing selection of a paid career ad-
ministrator to do a combined job. The
bill ends the semi-autonomous park and
recreation commissions and creates a
new Department of Parks, Recreation,
and Conservation under control Of the
County Executive. The merger bill also
gave strong powers to a nine-member
non-salaried citizen board. None may
serve more than three three-year terms.

) HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of family
campers will visit the sixty-one acres Of
the National Park System which pro-
vide campsites this summer and will

retary Of the Interior Udall.

ice’s conservation and development pro-
gram, proposes completion of thirty
thousand campsites, capable Of han-
dling more than one hundred thousand
campers per day by 1966. During its

about 12,800 campsites were available

mately sixty thousand campers per day.

} TWELVE MEMBERS of the National
Recreation Association National Advi-
sory Council have just concluded a his-
tory-making meeting with the NRA
Board of Directors at National head-
quarters in New York City. Recom-
mendations and reports were presented
to the Board by Council members after
two days Of hard-hitting committee
work under the chairmanship of Tom
Lantz of Seattle.

The response of the entire group was
voiced by Susan Lee, NRA vice-presi-
dent, who stated that this kind of com-
munication with active leaders in the
field was stimulating, thought provok-
ing, and of Significant value to the
Board and the entire organization.

In addition to Mr. Lantz, Council
members present included : Paul Boehm,
South Bend, Indiana; Ernest Craner,
Twin Falls, Iowa; Woodrow Dukes, Ft.
Pierce, Florida; William H. Keeling,

} TAKING SOME GIANT STEPS: Minne-
sota will set aside one-third of the tax
revenues from gasoline sold for non-
highway purposes for park land acqui-
sition and development. Estimated yield
is $300,000 biennially. The state has
created four new parks totaling 28,000
acres and has appropriated $65,000 to
buy land for the proposed 2,450-acre
Fort Snelling State Park.

Nebraska has authorized a .30-mill
levy to buy and develop state parks as
part of the state’s ten-year park devel-
opment program.

The Michigan Conservation Commis-
sion has moved to prohibit Oil and gas
wildcatting on state park and recreation
area lands, though Oil companies may
still lease the lands for protective pur-
poses. The commission’s policy will be
to deny drilling applications for the
park lands except when production on
adjacent land threatens to drain oil or
gas from the state property. In such
cases minimum wells would be consid-
ered if the facilities did not jeopardize
park developments and use.

RECREATION

I editorial I

Time to tell folks what recreation. is really all about.

JUNE Is NATIONAL RECREATION MONTH—the theme this year:

JUNE, 1961

 

NEW H ORIZONS FOR YOUR FREE TIME

E VERY NOW AND THEN someone says to me: “In our town

we offer recreation twelve months a year. Why should

it be only June that is called National Recreation Month?”

Let us answer that with another question: “Do you usu-

ally give people presents just any old time or do you wait
for a birthday, Christmas, or another special occasion?”

Of course, every month can and should bring its own rec-
reation opportunities, and promotion of its seasonal activi-
ties, but National Recreation Month provides the occasion
for emphasizing specific services developed throughout the
year and for telling the story behind them. It also can act as
an ideal Springboard for new phases of program. Introduce
them with a splash!

National Recreation Month gives citizens a special reason
for visiting recreation facilities and agencies they have
never seen before; it gives you an opportunity to talk with
them about the meaning and philosophy behind all recrea¢
tion programs.

All year long we are engrossed in the performance of our
jobs-planning facilities, offering activities, and so on—
and June is the time for special events plus. Plus what?
Plus the reminder that individual events and programs are
part of something bigger; plus an extra-warm invitation to
everyone to find out what recreation can mean to him; plus
a pat on the back for the many people who have helped to
make your year-round operations possible; plus an oppor-
tunity to call citizen attention to your community program.

June, in short, is the time for you to paint the big picture
of what recreation really is and how important it is.

Why June instead of July or some other month? Because
the great majority of the recreation agencies and depart-
ments atliliated with the National Recreation Association
voted for June as the best month in which to hold this spe.
cial observance.

We know that, for some of you, other months might be
better, but this would have been true no matter which month
was chosen. Since the choice was so overwhelmingly for
June, however, June it will continue to be. We hope that all
of you are finding it possible to hold Observances, so that
you may benefit from the increasing national interest in this
month. (See also “A Basic Need,” Page 291.)

National Recreation Month has been designed to help all
Americans find more challenging and creative uses for their
leisure time. It is designed to help you set your sights for
another year and to help you find “new horizons” for com-
munity free time. Don’t forget that the best results are ob-
tained with the cooperation of all other recreation-related

agencies.
Happy Recreation Month to all of you!

and progressing to today’s powerful and luxurious
cars, such as the Thunderbird, Chrysler Imperial or 1961
Cadillac—Detroit measures for us the industrial progress
of our nation in the last half-century. As in a journey in a
time machine, the visitor to Detroit is transported back
through time to the industry’s beginnings in a small garage
———via the exhibits at Ford’s Greenfield Village and in the
Ford Museum. Delegates to the 43rd National Recreation
Congress, October 1-6, will want to include these in their
sightseeing while in Detroit, for here has been gathered, and

Americana.

Greenfield Village, for example, is in itself a living mu-
seum, in that it consists of two hundred acres outdoors——
where homes, shops, public buildings have been restored
and historical shrines preserved. The village was the per-
sonal hobby of the late Henry Ford—a man who mistrusted
written histories—and shows to what lengths a hobby can
carry a man and what pleasure it can give to others as well.
Mr. Ford’s goal was to “reproduce American life as lived.”
It is a wonderful place to browse and to wander down the
street of Early American craft shops. You can also ride

The City—Some measure of Detroit’s status as a metropolis
was established last fall when, for the first time, new models
of the automobile industry were first exhibited in that city.
In previous years, the manufacturers brought their latest
wares to New York City to give the public its first look at
the new designs.

Detroit has suffered many growing pains. Once a quiet
city, brewing beer and hammering together carriages and
stoves, the city was staggered by impact of the automobile
age that has made it the country’s fifth largest city. Today
it covers nearly 150 square miles—almost all of it as un-
dulating as the bottom of a Hatiron. The city was laid out
on the lines of the L’Enfant plan for Washington, DC. with
streets radiating from a series of circles. Somewhere along
the way a gridiron pattern was superimposed, resulting in
a maze remarkable in its confusion. Today, civic planning
is desperately trying to change the complexion of the city.

Culture in Clusters—Many of Detroit’s museums are world
famous. [They are located in what the city has officially
designated as its cultural center. Two miles from downtown,
the Municipal Institute of Arts and the main public library
confront each other in impressive white marble, across wide
lawns and Woodward Avenue, Detroit’s main artery. They
are flanked by other imposing landmarks: the Detroit His-
torical Museum; the Rackham Memorial, seat of more than
forty engineering and scientific societies and of the Detroit
Extension of the University of Michigan; and International
Institute, a center for the folk culture and folk art of De-
troit’s more than forty nationality groups. On the north
side of the Art Institute is Detroit’s Children’s Museum, and
ranging over the blocks west of the library stretches the
campus of Wayne State University.

A stroll through the Detroit Institute of Arts is an adven-
ture. Each gallery encloses the paintings, sculpture and
crafts of a particular culture and period, thus recreating
something of the spirit and atmosphere of an age. Enor-
mous murals by Diego Rivera, depicting the vitality and
excitement of Detroit’s automotive industry, line the insti-
tute’s Rivera Court.

In the Detroit Historical Museum you may walk through
history in the “Streets of Old Detroit” exhibit. The “Street
of 1840” and the “Street of 1870” are life-sized reconstruc-
tions of the streets, storewalks, and storefronts of these
colorful periods.

Detroit has some nine hundred churches.

Parks—Among eight parks, Belle Isle takes the lead. In the
Detroit River between Detroit and Canada, it has long been
the city’s favorite cooling off place in summer. A quarter
of the island’s area is virgin woods, left unchanged except
for woodland trails. Its three-quarter-mile-long beach is
packed, picnic tables under the trees are laden, and crowds
enjoy the beauty of the evenings and music under the stars
or around the lighted fountains. An Aqua Theater, a com-
bination of proscenium and water stage in a dramatic out-
door setting, is the scene of water ballets, the yearly Aqua
Follies, and so on. The Children’s Zoo is also on Belle Isle.

Detroit is composed of many communities, many small
worlds within an assembly-line cosmopolis. It entirely sur-
rounds the little city of Hamtramck (2.09 square miles), a
politically independent entity largely populated by citizens
of Polish descent. This Polish background is reflected in
many of the signs, specialty stores and frequent celebra-
tions. The Dodge plant and others employ most of Ham-
tramck’s population.

Detroit’s “Gold Coast” is comprised of four exclusive
residential communities fronting on Lake St. Clair: Grosse
Pointe Shores, Grosse Pointe Farms. Grosse Pointe, and
Grosse Pointe Park. Here are the estates of many of the
families who built Michigan’s giant industries.

You will have a chance to look into all of this and a great
deal more when you attend the National Recreation Con-
gress. Also, for further details, the September issue of
RECREATION will carry an article about the municipal
recreation department program, areas and facilities in De-
troit, and point up some of the things unique to that de-
partment and of special interest. Watch for it! #-

If you are a recreation executive, or leader, or volun-

FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE FEDERAL HOUSING PROGRAIVI,
at least by the latter 1930’s, the National Recreation Asso-
ciation established a cooperative and consultant relationship
with the Federal Public Housing authorities. It has re-

washington by the heads of the Association’s research and
field staffs. Two important problems which received special
consideration were: (a) the amount of recreation space,

2. Joint. Planning

From the outset the National Recreation Association de-
clared its acceptance of the principle laid down by the pub-
lic housing program that new neighborhoods created in
communities by virtue of the establishment of such federal
projects should be considered as normal neighborhoods, the
same as other sections of a locality. This concept pointed up
more sharply the importance of joint planning by the local
housing, recreation, school, and municipal planning author-
ities. Many of the projects developed in localities consti-
tuted a new neighborhood. In some instances the projects
were not a total new neighborhood in the usual sense.

In many communities throughout the country, the co-
operative relationship between the housing and recreation

Through the years, the Association has responded on
many occasions at the request of local recreation authorities
and housing officials to make its field staff available to assist
With these important planning procedures at the local level.
The housing authorities have expressed wide appreciation
of the interest and cooperation received from community
recreation authorities and from the National Recreation
Association in the many and varied attempts to meet these
overall needs. Happily, there has been increasing accept-

reation facilities and services to local housing occupants
(see RECREATION, May 1960, Page 209). In some instances
the desired results have not been so successfully achieved.
The Association’s experience, derived from its work with
both local recreation and housing leaders, and from many
joint conferences with federal and district housing officials,
points clearly to the fact that local cooperation by the two
forces, in order to be more uniformly effective, should be-
gin in advance of rather than after actual construction 0]

tends to eliminate problems that have resulted where such

two forces to see to it that through the proper utilization
of the federal and local resources the people in these neigh-

need. The Association’s help will continue as heretofore
through joint staff meetings and special sessions at the
National Recreation Congress and at the Association’s Dis-
trict Conferences for the consideration of important hous-

THE
FAMILY

GOES
CAMPING

George T. Wilson

MERICAN fami-
lies of today

are becoming
camping families.
Some have long
been camping fam-

ilies but

 

we are

now faced with a
rapid resurgency of interest. One of the
peculiarities of camping families is that
each is sure its own rig is the best and
that facilities provided ought to meet
its needs specifically. Since recent esti-
mates place camping families at around
the four million mark, it is quite obvi-
ous this cannot be done.

With this in mind, the Milwaukee
Family Camping Association, under
Department of Municipal Recreation
sponsorship, and in cooperation with
the regional office of the U., S. Forest
Service, developed a questionnaire sur-
vey which it hoped would help interpret
camper needs to those concerned with
facilities and planning for family camp-
ing. Some seven hundred urban camp-
ing families were sent survey forms and
a little over two hundred completed
ones were returned for an approximate
twenty-eight percent return. The survey
largely reflects the preferences of urban

campers who have had previous family
camping experience. The typical camp-
ing family surveyed was made up of
four and one-half persons.

The single-angle campsite as planned
by the U. S. Forest Service was the
choice of fifty-five percent, with the
“Y.” and bypass type evenly distributed
among the balance. The survey estab-
lished the most desirable site for each
family as being the single-angle with a
minimum area of 50,-by-50’, With a spur
road 12’-by-40’, and an extension added
to accommodate a boat trailer or camp-
ing gear trailer. Heavy-duty barrier
posts eighteen inches high should ring
the spur road to prevent vehicles from
driving on the grass or other surface
area.

Campers overwhelmingly favored the
single-angle-design campsite with each
site equipped with one table and indi-
vidual grate or campfire ring. They
wanted a clean, separate toilet of the
out-houSe variety and safe, pure pump
water Within three hundred feet. More
“citified” developments of campsites
may be needed for certain campers, but
emphasis should remain on philosophy
of “not taking the city to the country.”

The ideal site will be about one-half
shaded and have grass surface. Move-
able wood platforms and rotation of
areas where use is great may prevent
deterioration from overuse. Most camp-
ers use the gasoline pressure-type stove
and sometimes have trouble finding a
source of white gas. The individual

important. On grates, a

grate of 18” to 24" high was preferred.

questionnaire gave a high rating

pump water, a table, clean outhouses,
wood for fires, their own campfire
grate, and swimming nearby. They at-
tached little importance to flush toilet
and laundry facilities, tap water, and
those facilities which “citify” a camp-
ground. It ought to be pointed out,
however, that other campers "just
breaking in” may wish such facilities.
It would appear that the greatest num-
ber of facilities provided should be
simple and rustic, but some so-called
“deluxe”? facilities could be provided.

Interpretive programs and guide
service may have been considered un-
important because such services are
new in this field. However, wherever
they have tried, they have been highly
successful and have added much to
camp life enrichment as indicated by
some twenty-eight percent who were
willing to pay extra for such services.
It should be noted, however, that camp-
ers responding to this questionnaire
camped most frequently in Wisconsin
Where little has been done with inter-
pretive services. Where such programs
have been developed elsewhere, they
have been highly successful.

RECREATION

 

Considered fairly important were
trails, police protection, grocery store
near the campsite, and to a consider-
able number, cut wood for fires. It
would appear from this that self-guid-
ing nature trails were “catching on”
and again that the campfire plays a very
important part in camp life, with fire-
wood becoming a most important prob-
lem for both camper and camp-area

administrator.
A DOLLAR per night or five dollars
per week campsite fee was favored
for the campsite. Campers were willing
to pay only a very little more for “de-
luxe” facilities. It would appear that
camping is attractive for many reasons
and that economy is one important rea-
son. The campers believed that priority
of campsite development should be
placed upon facilities providing week-
end or longer opportunities. The pri-
vate development of overnight camp
stops for families could help alleviate

campers range far and wide for their
annual vacation trek. However, rapidly
growing weekend camping trips are
generally confined to an area within a
radius of three hundred miles of the
camper’s home. This would indicate
that planners and developers for the
facilities should give special recogni-
tion to the need for the development of
numerous campsites Within six or seven
hours’ driving time from large metro-
politan centers.

The number-one pet peeve of camp-
ers is overcrowding. Others mentioned
frequently were rowdiness, noise,
young people’s late parties, unsanitary
facilities, inadequate garbage disposal
cans, and poor methods of fee collec-
tion. All appear to be remedial, but
overcrowding may get worse before it
gets better.

be used for the weekend or longer de-

per cent believed that local communi-
ties were justified in developing and
maintaining campsites, although such
sites would be used largely by non-resi-
dent campers.

Over half of the campers responding
were tent campers, while most of the
remainder used tent-type trailers. A
smaller group used station wagons,
slept in cars or used house-trailers. The
rapid growth in popularity of tent-type
trailers was indicated. Campers camped
as few as three days and as many as

average. Most families, however, aver-
aged from twenty to twenty-five days.

Social Rehabilitation

of the HOMEBOUND

A pioneering pro ject-—-to bring the handicapped out of their homes

to rejoin life in their community

Morton Thompson, Ed.D.

N THE LAST DECADE, recreation or
social rehabilitation programs have
been developed for many types of

ill and handicapped children and
adults. They have arisen in hospitals,
mental institutions, associations for the
handicapped in schools, camps for the
handicapped, and homes for the aged.
Unfortunately, there is still another
large group of people in this country
who are not institutionalized or in dire
need of constant hospitalization. These
are the homebound. They include
many thousands of persons who are
confined to their homes for long periods
of time. Most of the homebound have
physical ailments or disabilities; many
have multiple conditions such as partial
paralysis and heart conditions. Others
have psychological problems because of
their ailments and become increasingly
withdrawn due to isolation and loneli-

ness. In family relationships, over-

sulting Service on Recreation for the Ill
and Handicapped and is director of the

protection by a husband, wife, or chil-
dren leads to withdrawal. Still another
factor is finance, for many of the home-
bound handicapped are on welfare,
social security, or in the lower income
bracket and cannot afford the help and
transportation to get out of the house.
Many of the homebound are restricted
to beds or wheelchairs; others live in
walkup apartments, making it extreme-
ly diHicult to get out.

Today, there are some recreation pro-
grams for the homebound but, in each
instance, the program” is confined to a
specific agency and to one specific type
of program. For example, three of the
better programs for the homebound in
New York City are the Children’s
Homebound Recreation Service, the
Montefiore Hospital program, and the
program of the Federation of the
Handicapped. The first program is
limited to children, the second provides
recreation professional home visits, and
the third, an activity center.

In 1959 Mrs. Beatrice H. Hill, then
director of the National Recreation As-
sociation Consulting Service on the Ill

Family Fun Night for the Retarded

NCE A MONTH, all the retarded chil-
dren of Clark County in south-
western Washington are invited, along
with their families, to meet at the
Hough School gymnasium for an eve-
ning of entertainment and games. This
idea for the event originated in 1957 at
a regular business meeting of the Clark
County Association for the Mentally
Handicapped Children which is com-
posed mainly of parents of mentally re-
tarded children attending special-edu-

302

cation classes in the Clark County pub-
lic schools.

The members feel that recreation is
an important tool for developing self-
confidence in the mentally retarded and
that these children need the give-and-
take of group experiences—just as any
other child—but without competition
or tension. They hoped too, that par-
ents and the normal brothers and sisters
would gain better understanding of
their problems by talking with others

and Handicapped, applied to the U. S.
Office of Vocational Rehabilitation for
financial assistance to develop a demon-
stration project for the homebound
which would demonstrate for communi-
ties how a complete program could be
developed on a community level. The
project entitled “Meeting Some Social-
Psychological Needs of Homebound
Persons through Recreative Experi-
ence” was awarded to the National
Recreation Association on July 1, 1960.
The project staff selected two agencies
for the study, Bellevue Hospital Home
Care Division, a city hospital, and the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York, a
volunteer agency. Two professional
recreation workers were assigned to
work with the agencies. These pro-
fessionals were to direct the volunteers
for the agencies’ programs.

T HE PLAN included. selection of a

maximum of one hundred cases to
participate in the two-year project,
fifty from each agency. The team de-
cided that the program would be a day-
time program because those hours were

faced with the same situation.

No dues are assessed and few rules
are observed so as to keep the affair
informal and give everyone a feeling of
being welcome and unpressured. The
one rule to which they adhere is that
no small children can attend without a
parent or guardian but the older re-
tarded children (above eighteen) may
come alone to help develop their sense
of independence.

The evening is divided into four half-

the most boring for the homebound
when their families were in school or
working. This meant that day-time
volunteers would have to be recruited
and this posed the project’s greatest
hurdle.

The team set as its goal a four-phase

include: the volunteer

program to
bringing activity into the home on an
individual basis, group recreation in an
activity center, trips in the community,
and referrals to existing community
agency facilities for more permanent
social and cultural ties. Transportation
was planned by contracting for a spe-
cial station-wagon service whose per-
sonnel could handle wheelchair and

other handicapped problems.

AFTER the first eight months of the
project the team has some signifi-
cant findings to report: F ifty-six home-
bound cases are now being serviced by
the project. Of the fifty-six cases,
twenty-eight are visited weekly in their
homes by volunteers who provide
music, crafts, discussion, games, writ-
ing, language instruction and many
other activities. Two women have
learned to crochet with one hand.
Twenty-one of the homebound now at-
tend the activity center weekly to par-
ticipate in group activities which have
already included crafts, glee club,
parties, game sessions, lectures, discus-
sions, hairdressing, jewelry making,
and rhythm bands. Nineteen of the
group receive home visits and attend
the activity center. Trips have been

made to Radio City, the Ice Capades,

museums, and movies, and others are
being planned.

Three of the patients have been re-
ferred to community agencies and suc-
cessfully integrated into their program.
These persons are accompanied at first
by a member of the project staff and
then by one of the volunteers. Even
though they attend the community
agency program they are still included
in the homebound project.

Thirty-three day-time volunteers are
participating in the project. They were
recruited by the project team on an
individual and personal basis through
visits, calls, and letters by the staff to
department stores, churches, unions
and colleges. All volunteers were ori-
ented and trained through group and
individual workshops. They were then
assigned and supervised by the profes-
sional staff. Some of the volunteers
lead specific activities, others
trained for home visits, some assist on
trips and for parties. A group of
graduate students from Columbia Uni-
versity are outstanding. Relatives and
friends are included as much as pos-
sible in the volunteer and activity

are

programs.

THE PROJECT TEAM proved that day-
time volunteers can be recruited
even in a large city but only on a per-
sonal contact basis with much follow-up
work involved. Equipment used in the
project includes record players, musical
instruments, records, books, magazines,
crafts materials, quiet table games, and
active games. The homebound select

AND HANDICAPPED

 

from lists what they would like to have
at home and the equipment is delivered
and picked up by one of the station
wagons weekly. This plan was very suc-
cessful.

The patients are learning skills, many
have improved both in appearance and
outlook. Patients are now editing the
new Homebound Newspaper, a copy of
which goes to all of the group and is es-
pecially welcome by those who cannot
leave their homes. The project plans
call for an increased number of cases,
more volunteers, and an extended pro-
gram. Plans include outings, barbe-
cues, boat rides, and overnight stays on
a farm during the summer.

The most important discovery is the
fact that some of the homebound now
participating in the recreation program
outside of their homes have not been
out of their homes for periods of ten to
twenty years. This speaks for itself!

THE FINAL PHASES of the program
will include many referrals to
other local community facilities, assist-
ance to other agencies and communities
for development of similar programs,
and preparation of a written report on
the two-year study including develop-
ment plans, program, problems, costs of
a program, and recommendations for
local communities.

ORGANIZED
GUNK-HOLING

A column of outboard club craft shims its way past ageless river blujfs.

ID YOU EVER go gunk-holing? As defined by old
D “salts,” gunk-holing is the art of cruising and ex-

ploring small, shallow bays and inlets, the tiny trib-
utary streams that feed into a large body of water, or the
'desolated, picturesque harbors that exist off the regular
boating lanes. It has been a favorite sport for years among
pleasure-boat skippers, but the outboard boating clubs
have tacked it down to a perfect group activity embodying
all the best fun in boating. They conduct club-organized
cruises almost every weekend throughout the regular boat-
ing season; and if they normally cruise the northern waters
in the summer, they plan winter vacation trips to the south-
‘lands to make it a year-round sport.

A recent poll of the nation’s top outboard-boating clubs
revealed that the reason for the clubs’ successful gunk-holing
cruises lies in their pre-cruise preparation. Whether it’s a
large or small group, whether it’s to be a short one-day
cruise, an overnight trip or an extended cruise of several
days’ duration, success is determined by the amount of time
and effort that goes into planning and preparing.

Here’s how an outboard club goes about planning and
preparing for a cruise:

A cruise master, who is an experienced outboarder, is
selected by the club or by the club commodore. The cruise
master, in turn, appoints an assistant to help him in plan-
ning, completing arrangements, etcetera. The cruise master
also appoints a tailman to cruise at the rear of the formation,
where he can go to the aid of any boat encountering me-
chanical trouble.

It is the duty of the cruise master and his assistants to
plan all club cruises for the year. Members’ comments and
suggestions for specific cruises are welcomed. Some clubs
appoint a cruise master who in turn appoints a cruise cap-
tain to handle the details of the various cruises as they come
up on the club’s calendar. He makes a preliminary scouting
trip over the proposed route to check and mark danger
spots, locate refueling stations and check mileage, time, and
other essentials. In addition, the cruise master and his as-
sistants make arrangements for eating and refueling, notify
lock tenders of the date and approximate time the group
will be coming through, and get. instructions on how the

group can make the trip through the locks with a minimum
of confusion and delay.

If it is to be an overnight cruise, the cruise master also
lines up eating and sleeping accommodations for the group.
notifies local police to be sure members’ cars and trailers
will be guarded at the launching site and that their boats
will be protected while moored overnight.

The date, destination and general details of the upcoming
cruise are announced at the regular meeting of the club.
Members who plan to make the cruise are asked to notify
the cruise master so that he will have some idea of how
many boats and persons to plan for in making final arrange-
ments. About a week before the cruise date,.'every member
of the club receives a “Cruise Bulletin,” prepared by the
cruise master, containing all pertinent information regard-
ing the cruise; such as: time and place of launching; route
to be followed; how many miles to be covered; estimated
time of arrival at destination and return to home port; re-
fueling stations along the route; and eating arrangements.

Other details that should be included are: names and
duties of the various cruise officers and all boats taking part
in the cruise; a map or hand-drawn sketch of the cruise
route; hand signals to be used; special instructions on pro-
cedure to be followed in launching, going through locks,
information on scenic and historic spots of interest along
the route, arrangements that have been made for sleeping
accommodations.

A list of equipment each boat making the cruise is re-
quired to carry should be determined and shared with mem-
bers. A typical list would include the following: a life jacket
or bouyant cushion for each person in the boat; proper
lights; extra gas tank; fire extinguisher; spare spark plugs;
sheer pins and cotter keys; paddle; at least fifty feet of
line; anchor; and tool kit, including manufacturer’s in-
structions for repair and maintenance of the motor.

As each boat arrives at the launching site, the skipper
registers with the cruise master who makes up a list of the
boats and names of their occupants. Using this list, he as-
signs each boat a position in the cruise formation. The
cruise master and his assistants help the skippers in launch-

SLIMNASTICS—American Style

What one recreation department does to help women toward physical fitness

NEWSTANDS over-
flow with pub-
lications carrying
articles about phy-
sical fitness. Insur-
ance companies is-
sue booklets; TV,
radio and national
magazines exhort us to keep fit. Our
slimnastics program developed as a par-
tial response to this need. The stall of
the Rock Hill, South Carolina, Parks
and Recreation Department deliberated
at length concerning the form the pro-
gram should take and its potential par-

ticipants.
Purpose. To help each participant un-

 

derstand the necessary requirements for
better health through exercise and
proper nutrition; and to provide health
education for daily living and exercises
for physical fitness.

trated nature of the course, it was de-
cided to limit membership to twenty
adult women, each to pay one dollar to
help defray expenses of materials used.
The program was set up on a ten-week
basis, with classes meeting for an hour
and a half, two days a week. Fees were
paid upon registration. At no point did
the department guarantee that a partici-
pant would lose weight or benefit in any
way from the course. We did point out
that it had been our experience that
with exercise and proper diet, people
felt better and their endurance in-
creased.

At the beginning of the course, each
women was asked to submit measure-
ments of shoulders, chest, bust, waist,
hips, thigh, calf, arms, and also weight
and height. This information helped us
evaluate each woman’s weight problem
during her initial interview, when each
was advised as to how much she should
gain or lose, according to skeletal struc-
ture and bone size.

The Program. The first part of the pro-

gram consisted of discussions and in-
struction in regard to a healthful diet.
Each woman was given a common calo-
rie chart listing about 145 items, with
the suggestion that she also consult her
own physician if she wanted more diet-
ing information for purposes of reduc-
ing weight.

We also supplied participants with
a booklet, compiled by our staff. con-
taining simple facts of anatomy and
physiology, and some hints on over-
coming muscular soreness, which might
be expected from the exercises planned
for them.
Exercisesn-The first meeting consisted
of a few simple sit-ups, leg raises.
and squatting exercises so participants
would not become too sore or discour-
aged. Other exercises. aliecting other
areas of the body u ere gradually added.
At the end of three weeks. all exercises
were executed fifteen times each, and
continued for two more weeks. \t the
end of fire weeks, we started a new
series of exercises to employ other mus-

305

cles, and to add interest.

At the conclusion of the course, each
woman was measured again to note any
changes. Although some participants
had not lost any weight or inches, there
was a general feeling of fitness and well
being. The program was judged suc-
cessful.

Following its termination, we re-
ceived many phone calls urging another
course at night, for working women,
and requesting more courses during the
day. We organized a night course and
announced a summer course to be given
at 7:30 A.M., daily.

InThe latter consisted of a forty-five
minute exercise period, followed by
forty-five minutes of tennis instruction
for the first five weeks, and swimming
instruction for the last five. We wanted

to use the slimnastics class as a spring-
board for other activities, thereby wi-
dening the recreation interests of the
participants. This, too, met with over-
whelming response, and, again, we had
to keep registration down to twenty
women. The courses were not only suc-
cessful by our standards but also by the
public’s, for it will not allow us to drop
this program.

Conclusions and
Recommendations

0 We found it best to conduct a mini-
mum of two classes a week. However,
it is preferable to meet three times, with
each session lasting an hour and a half.
0 Equipment depends upon which ex-
ercises are to be given and how many
people are participating. Basic equip-

ment consists of mats, benches, small
five-pound weights, and old broomstick
handles. We have found this sufiicient.

If there seems to be an unmet need
in your community for this type of pro-
gram, we urge you to consider it. You
will reach a segment of the population
not always reached by standard recrea-
tion programs. Disparate as their back-
grounds are, participants are meeting
for a common purpose——the desire for
physical fitness. We have found in our
sessions that their mutual endeavors
have extended beyond exercise. Many
fine church suppers have originated in
our slimnastics classes, as well as pie-
nics, tennis matches, and card parties.
Although these were not primary objec-
tives, we feel that such secondary re-
sults also satisfy a recreation need. #

Exercise in Tranquillity

OVEMENT—EVEN FLOWING, SUS-
M tained, and light—typifies the
exercise which was evolved in
China over many centuries and was cre-
ated in the form we have today nearly
one thousand years ago. Contrary to
the vigorous health exercises in our
Western civilization, it is composed of
calm, unhurried movements designed
to “build up energy and not expend it.”
This fascinating principle is being dem-
onstrated at the United Nations every
week. There the ancient exercise is be-
ing taught to the Secretariat staff by
Sophia Delza, an American who came
upon it in China and who has studied it
for many years. It is being taken up for
its many healthful benefits by New
Yorkers, too, and.-many others across
the country as our nation-wide interest
in keeping fit increases.

Known as T’ai Chi Ch’uan (pro-
nounced Ty-Gee-Chuan), it is a system
of exercise for physical, emotional, and
mental. development devised to train the
mind and body, to prolong life, and at-
tain tranquillity. It is made up of 108
forms,- with variations, which are per-
formed in a slow continuous sequence.
Miss Delza says that we in the West are
apt to overexert ourselves in tense phys-

ical exercise and sports, whereas the
premise of T’ai Chi Ch’uan is that dis-

ciplined movement need not be tense
and hard, need not overactivate the
heart, in order to develop well-being.

HE VARIOUS forms of the exercise
(which carry such evocative names
as The Single Whip, The Golden Cock-
erel, and The Snake Creeps Down) flow
smoothly into each other and bring ev-
ery part of the body into play, from the
smallest finger joint to the largest mus-
cle. The entire sequence must take a
minimum of twenty minutes to perform,
but, with practice, the action can be
slowed down to take a longer time.
The flowing technique of the exercise
helps to concentrate the mind and calm
the disposition, it makes the muscles
pliant, develops coordination, improves
circulation, facilitates the flexible ac-
tion of joints, quickens reflexes, and
makes one alert and easy. It is per-
formed without music, always, and “by
oneself, for oneself.”
Instructions for eighteen of the forms
are given on a recent recording by Miss

Delza (Colpix CP413, $3.98) , available
from Arthur Pine, 225 West 57th Street,
New York 19, or at your local record
shop. A forthcoming book by Miss
Delza, to be released soon by David Mc-
Kay Publications, will be entitled Body
and Mind in Harmony. #

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

Do you subscribe to the common

misconception regarding the severely handicapped child?
Should the community recreation program include him?

Is He Entitled: to Recreation?

Janet Pomeroy

PEOPLE IN GENERAL, and recreation
leaders in particular, need to ac-
quire a new concept concerning severely
physically handicapped persons. A per-
son in a wheelchair or on crutches who
is severely physically handicapped may
not be ill. Yet, people often associate
such a handicap with a crippling dis-
ease, and either think of the person as ill or as a patient who

 

is recuperating. The word patient means, “a sick person,
now, commonly, one under treatment or care as by a physi-
cian or surgeon or one in a hospital, hence, a client of a
physician,” according to Webster’s New International Dic-
tionary. This does not apply to a large number of the handi-
capped.

MRS. POMEROY is founder and director of the Recreation
Center for the Handicapped in San Francisco, California.

C ratches forgotten, Skippy makes friends with “Midnight.”

 

 

The common misconception of the severely physically
handicapped-—particularly those with multiple handicaps——
as ill persons has been a deterrent in the provision of com-
munity recreation programs for this group. It brings about
a chain reaction that retards or even prevents the inclusion
of these persons in regular programs and/or the develop—
ment of recreation programs for them. Some health and
welfare agencies associated with the severely physically
handicapped have, no doubt unknowingly, contributed to
the general misunderstanding of these persons by creating
stereotypes through the use of medical labels. For example,
we hear cerebral-palsied persons referred to as “CP’s” or
“spastics.” Recreation activities conducted by some of the
welfare groups have been called “spastic activities” or
“group activities for CP’s.” This specialization within an
isolated group does little to encourage their acceptance by
community groups of any type, including recreation pro-

grams. This situation is also found in residential institu-
tions for the severely handicapped. '

It is entirely possible that a severely physically handi-
capped person, even though he may be bedbound, has never
spent any time in a hospital, and that his only experience
as a patient was the time he had the measles or some other
illness common to children. His handicap could have been
caused by a birth injury that resulted, in cerebral palsy,
for example,” in a condition rather than an illness. Even if
his handicap was caused by a crippling disease such as
polio, he would be considered, following his recovery,
merely physically handicapped.

Unfortunately, recreation leaders who are trained in gen-
eral community recreation tend to believe that they are not
qualified to work with such persons. In reality, however,
they may be the most desirable leaders to be so doing. Al-
though working in recreation with persons who are truly
ill requires specialized training, it does not follow that the
community recreation leader needs be medically oriented to
work successfully with physically handicapped persons who

are well.
Attitudes

A recreation leader should understand that the severely
handicapped:

1. Are first and foremost people .' . . who have the same

basic needs, desires and interests as the nonhandicapped
. . . that the handicapped are more like others than they
are different from them.

2. Need to participate as regular members of the comm u-
nity through recreation interests . . . not through isolated
groups of persons who happen to have the same type of
handicap.

3. Have the same right as others to choose and to share
in the planning of their own recreation activities, and to
participate voluntarily.

4. Can participate in a wide variety of activities in the
community, particularly if they have the encouragement and
guidance of good leadership.

The Recreation Approach

The professionally prepared recreation leader’s very lack
of specific medical orientation may actually be an advan-

tage. As Dr. Ralph W. Menge recently stated in RECREA-
TION magazine ( October 1960) : “To make therapeutic use
of himself, it isn’t necessary for the professional recreator to
know a great deal about sickness. Nor is it necessary that
he be a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist.” If
the recreation leader is not too involved with the medical
and technical background of individuals, he will tend to ac-
cept and treat these persons as participants in a regular
recreation program. If he is not hampered and confused
by their presumed “limitations,” he does not set up mental
blocks in his own mind concerning their abilities and po-
tentialities. Moreover, medical opinion on these so-called
limitations is often inconsistent and continually changing.

A severely physically handicapped person needs to be
able to express himself naturally, through interest or other
normal motivation, without worrying about what muscle he
must move or exercise because it is “good for him.” In
addition, if he knows that the recreation leader is not pre-
occupied with what is good for him he is more relaxed and
at ease as a participant. Therapy is essential and necessary
for most severely physically handicapped individuals. How-
ever, the recreato‘r is not a therapist, but rather a leader
who provides them with incentives and opportunities to ex-
ceed their limitations—all of which results indirectly in
desirable therapy.

Recreators do, however, need to have special information
and skills that will help them in the physical handling of
the severely physically handicapped. For example, in prep-
aration for swimming or overnight campouts, leaders must
often assist in removing braces. Leaders also need to be
acquainted with the handling of wheel chairs, feeding those
who are unable to eat by themselves, and in assisting those
who require toilet help. When such assistance is required,
information is usually requested from parents and is in-
cluded on application forms together with other pertinent
information, including a medical report from the family
physician. Advisory committees which include technicians
and practitioners in services to severely physically handi-
capped persons can provide valuable guidance to the recrea-
tion staff. Some colleges (for example, San Francisco State
College) are now including in the recreation curriculum ap-
propriate pregraduate courses in “Recreation for Special
Groups” which include some orientation toward the physi-
cally handicapped.

We must always remember that recreation is for all mem-
bers of the community whatever their condition. #-

ECREATION can open doors that no other activity of our life can

. . . expands our horizons to make our world include new peo-
ple, new settings, new enjoyment. Every time we branch out into
a different activity, we add another dimension of excitement to

our lives.

Q

.‘ Musiclay Modeling Party

A clever idea which can also make use of other creative activities

iebolt Frieswyk

IXING CLAY WITH music may not

at first appear to be a likely for-

mula for a party. However, a

‘ usiclay modeling party can be an un-

- sual, fun-filled event. With the assist-

nce of a parents’ committee, the fol-

owing plan has been put to good use
everal times:

Invitations are sent to a selected
umber of boys and girls, eight through
welve years of age, known to be musi-
al. They are invited to a party consist-

' ng of entertainment, clay modeling
ith music, costume parade, musical
ames, A small
I harge is made to cover expenses. Boys
nd girls are requested to wear cos-
jumes representing a musical idea or

u ersonality.

[ When they arrive, hats, coats, rub-
‘ ers are checked, and volunteer parents

and refreshments.

‘ead the party-goers to their seats at
‘ ard tables or other tables. Adults are
eated along the sides or rear of the
7 all. All tables have been covered with
olorful paper tablecloths.
The master of ceremonies welcomes
' hose present to the party and intro-
l n uces the first part of the program. Tal-
inted young instrumentalists, singers,
nd dancers perform for about a half
, our and are appropriately applauded.
I The musiclay modeling contest is
hen explained by the MC. Committee
embers distribute packages of clay in
ifferent colors. The participants are
asked to listen to a musical recording,

forming arts for the National Recrea-
ion Association.

such as painting—especially finger painting—

writing of poetry and prose, and so on.

and, while the music is going on, to
model the clay into forms which express
the music. This activity lasts from five
to ten minutes for each selection. Qual-
ified volunteer judges go about from
table to table to select a number of win-
ning models while the selection is being
played. The winners for each selection
are called forward to the microphone,
their models shown, and prizes award-
ed. The MC then tells a brief story
about the composer and the selection

played.

 

Among the recordings used for these
parties have been Brahm’s Lullaby,
Tchaikowsky’s Dance of the Sugar
Plum Fairies, Saint-Saens’ Carnival of
Animals, Prokofieff’s Peter and the
Wolf, a Sousa march, and other chil-
dren’s musical classics. Folk music has
also been used as well as orchestral
pieces.

The clay models created by the boys
and girls ran the gamut from the more
literal to the more abstract, from the
unskilled to the skilled. The spontane-
ous response required by the game has
never failed ‘to provoke enthusiastic
laughter, lively discussion, and an ar-
ray of amusing, and sometimes unusu-
ally artistic, results.

One boy in response to a selection

from Peter and the Wolf modeled a lit-

tle devil complete with horns and long
tail. When asked to explain, he said
that the music reminded him of his
father. The father who was present said
that his son {was a little devil. This ex-
change took place at the micrOphone,
was enjoyed by everyone, and left no
doubt that both father and son had a
good time joking with each other. The
Sousa marches seemed to bring forth a
collection of footballs, probably be-
cause of the association of bands with
football games. The less familiar music
resulted in a greater variety of re-
sponses. The familiar Christmas carol
Silent Night resulted generally in vari-
ous babe-and-manger representations.
It is good to vary the unfamiliar music
with the familiar. Although winners
were chosen and prizes given, the ele-
ment of competition does not seem to
effect the party adversely. The main
purpose of the party is to have fun, and
the quick and surprising results of the
game fulfill the purpose successfully.

At the conclusion of the music-ar-
tistry part of the program, the musical
costume parade takes place. Each boy
and girl introduces himself, and ex-
plains his costume. Everyone gets a
prize for his costume, and the party
concludes with refreshments. At one
such party, a selected group came
dressed as musical notes and the leader
of the group played a tune by pointing
at the different notes—which were sung
by the wearer.

TERRIFIC TENNIS

TENUOUS BUDGET

William A. Welsh

WHEN YOUR
budget has

gone as far as it

can go, you still

have some re-

sources to draw

on: imagina-

 

tion, enthusiasm,
and vigor. They have paid off in Salina,
Kansas, where a summer recreation
staff of one hundred handles twenty
play areas and a half dozen special in-
structional activities. Like many other
towns of its size and smaller across the
country, this community of forty thou-
sand persons in north central Kansas
would appear to have an undermanned
recreation staff for the gross total atten-
dance of almost fifty thousand that par-
ticipate in its activities every year. But,
by meeting its problems with imagina-
tion and vigor, Salina has emerged with
the largest per capita summer program
in the state with the smallest per capita
cost.

The tennis instruction program is a
barometer of Salina’s success. In 1954,
thirty-five children, all between the ages
of eight and thirteen, were registered
for tennis instruction. By 1959, this
number had risen to 140, and included
children from five to sixteen. The gross
participation rose from three hundred
students in 1954- to 1,250 in 1959.

Tennis instruction is carried on for
eight weeks each summer, from the mid-
dle of June through the middle of Au-
gust. The program attempts to teach
the fundamental forehand and back-
hand strokes, the service, scoring, and
general rules for court conduct. It is

dent at Northwestern University, has

ation Commission for the past five

A medium-sized

Kansas community

ONA

aimed at producing 140 children who
can enjoy playing tennis, rather than
fourteen professionals-to-be.

There are six instructors, including
the director; and classes are conducted
from 9 AM to noon, five mornings a
week. Major instruction periods are
Tuesday through Thursday, since con-
Hicting major recreation activities for
the children are scheduled on Monday
and Friday mornings. Instruction is
held on six courts, all located together
in one large city park. Two of the

courts are concrete; four asphalt.

D URING the first one or two weeks of

the program, the problem of 140
students overcrowding six courts was
not serious. To teach the children the
basic forehand stroke, the ball was
bounced to them softly by instructors
standing on the opposite side of the
net, giving them controlled opportuni-
ties to practice their stroke, while ac-
quainting them with the sight of a ball
coming over the net. The newness of
the experience, coupled with a change
of students receiving attention every
two or three minutes, prevented bore-
dom. Later, however, when the students
were allowed to volley by themselves, or
with instructors, the space problem be-
came acute. And when competitive
events began, only two persons could
use each court at a time.

Initially, attempts were made to ro-
tate participants on each court at least
every thirty minutes. A second step was
to establish given days .on which a cer-
tain age group would have priority on
the use of the courts. However, the
most successful solution was a far more
unusual one.

Salina had recently constructed a
beautiful new swimming pool. The site

of the old pool was located adjacent to

its imagination.

the courts used for tennis instruction.
The city converted the bathhouse into
a museum, and filled and paved the old-
swimming area, providing an excellent.i
spacious dance area. The director 01
the tennis program, however, had othel
designs on the paved area.

Students Who were waiting for the
use of a court were sent to the fenced-in
paved area, where they batted balls be-
tween themselves gently, practicing
strokes, and sometimes just working oil
energy. This. was “free play”—-—a time
when the children could relax with a
minimum of supervision, without critii
cism or suggestions, and satisfy their
urge to “play tennis.” And, of course.
they were not impeding instruction.

ANOTHER PROBLEM which confronts

any program with limited facilities
is how to deal with students of widely
varying ages and quite different abiliJ
ties to learn within the same instruc-
tional periods. Of course, the children
were divided into groups on the basis
of age and ability, as far as facilities
and the number of instructors would
allow.

But the director of the program be-
lieved this problem to he basically psy-
chological. He talked with all the stu+
dents, both en masse and individually,
about the differing abilities they pos-
sessed. Every student was impressed
with the fact that people are different;
that they are given different abilities at
birth, and that slow learning is really
just as good as rapid progress, since
everyone would learn eventually. There
resulted a marked absence of self-cot?
sciousness among the slow learners. Thli
director also observed which instruc-
tors worked best with slower learners,-
and which were most effective in teach-
ing fundamentals, and these instructors

were assigned to groups of slower stu-
dents.

PERHAPS the biggest problems faced
by the Salina Recreation Commis-
sion’s summer tennis instruction pro-
gram were the age and relative inexpe-
rience of its instructors. Real interest
in tennis is new in Salina. In the last
ten years, the city has seen a tremen-
dous increase in the number of persons
who play tennis not only for enjoyment,
but also with a concern for the quality
of their play. Consequently, there is,
as yet, no pool of qualified tennis in-
structors from which to draw.

Of course, the problem is complicated
by the large number of college-age peo-
ple in Salina who leave during the sum-
mer for higher paying jobs in milder
climates or in metropolitan areas. This
has led to a summer program staff of a
quite younger average age, with rela-
tively little inexperience. Most of the
good prospects were girls, since many
boys can find jobs for higher pay.

In 1959, the fifth year after the reor-
ganization of the tennis program, the
instructional staff included, besides a
male director, age nineteen, one other
boy, seventeen, 'and four girls from
fourteen to seventeen. It was the task
of the program director to find the
strong points in this unusually young
group, and capitalize on them.

This staff had one big advantage,
however: it was closely familiar with
the program outline and methods of in-
struction used by the director. Three
of the four girls were “graduates” of
the program itself. This led to smooth
operation and a friendly atmosphere.
Also, the director was familiar with the
capabilities of each of the instructors,

even before the program began.

FROM THE BEGINNING, every effort
Was made to inculcate a desire in
the staff to make this the best tennis
instruction program in the state. The
instructors met for discussion, and con-
tinued this periodically during the sum-
mer. They talked frankly of the prob—
lems their studenfs would face, and the
difficulties they as instructors would en-
counter. This was a boldly mature way
to treat these young people, but they
reacted maturely, and made conscien-

JUNE, 1961

tious efforts to meet problems thought-
fully and thoroughly. The director con-
ducted afternoon sessions every day
throughout the summer for the instruc-
tors, constantly brushing up their fun-
damentals, and reviewing with them the
phases of instruction scheduled for the
following day.

Another basic problem for the Salina
tennis instruction program was its lim-
ited budget. The per capita levy for
recreation in Salina is the lowest in the
state. Quality of programs and services
offered certainly have not been sacri-
ficed, but a strictly defined budget is
closely adhered to. The tennis program
relied largely upon contributions for its

 

equipment needs. Tennis balls were ob-
tained from three sources:

0 The Salina Tennis Club, in coopera-
tion with the recreation commission,
sponsored an open tennis tournament
during the summer. The balls used in
the tournament were turned over to the
instruction program.

0 Balls used by members of the Salina
Tennis Club were sometimes donated,
on an individual basis, to the instruc-
tion program.

0 New balls were bought by the recrea-
tion commission for use in a final cham-
pionship tournament held for all sum-

mer students in August.

7 I‘ENNIs RACKETS were considerably
harder to obtain. The recreation

commission bought eight rackets be-
tween 1955 and 1959. Nine other rack-
ets were donated during that period by
Salina citizens. The Salina Recreation
Commission has found that open solici-
tation of such gifts by newspaper and
radio does not arouse objection from

taxpayers, if the appeal is not excessive.
Of course, most of the summer students

@PROGRAM

 

have their own rackets; the program’s
supply is merely to assure that no child
will be deprived of the opportunity to
learn because of lack of money to buy a

racket.

As the recreation commission must
live with budgetary limitations which
prevent the city from providing addi-
tional tennis courts or improving ex-
isting ones, there are many problems
related to handling the increasing num-
bers of tennis students. The city has
been asked by the commission to paint
outlines for several tennis courts on the
paved-in old swimming pool area.
When this is done, portable nets and
backstops could be used on these courts
during instructional periods. Three
courts would comfortably fit into the
area.

In the meantime, one of the suggested
solutions to an excess of students for the
available courts during morning in-
struction is the initiation of evening les-
sons. Unfortunately, only two courts in
the city are lighted, and they are in con-
stant use for general recreation pur-

poses.

THE INTENSIVE nature of summer rec-
reation activities in Salina adds
another problem to the operation of
the tennis instruction program. Three
other special activities programs are
conducted on the same mornings as ten-
nis instruction: archery, swimming, and
day camping.

While a certain amount of inter-ac-
tivity competition is healthy within a
summer recreation program, the ulti-
mate goal of the overall program must
be the fullest possible enrichment of
every participant. Consequently, recre-
ation leaders do not attempt to limit the
number of different activities in which
any child takes part. Of course, as an
example, any child who expresses to
a tennis instructor indecision as to
whether he should enroll in archery in-
struction is told that he would learn
tennis better by concentrating on it.
But beyond this simple statement, the
child is left to make his own decision.

Interestingly, the result to the tennis
program of this wide variety of avail-
able activities has not been the quanti-

tative loss of students on certain days,
but rather, the qualitative loss involved.
For it is most often the best tennis stu-
dent who is also interested in archery
and swimming; those with athletic abil-
ity tend to desire many outlets for their
talents. The loss to the program is that
they are not present to encourage and
inspire the slower learning children to
emulate them.

There is perhaps no complete answer
to this problem, but simply by keeping
students with approximately equal abil-
ities together, competition with equals
was substituted for inspiration from su-
periors. Dividing students into “mid-
get” and “junior” classifications also
allowed younger and inexperienced
children to compare their own progress
with that of fast learning students of
their own age and experience. Perhaps
the basic problem faced by the tennis
program director and instructors was
how to keep interest and enthusiasm
high in the face of these problems.

PROGRAM AIDS
A Ranking Chart. Beginning in the

fourth week of instruction, students
were placed on a ladder ranking chart,
according to their assessed abilities at
that point of instruction. Students who
were in the sixth grade or below were
placed on the “midget” ladder, with the
older children classified as “juniors.”
They competed with others on their lad-
der in a series of one-set matches, to de-
termine the ladder tournament cham-
pions. This was continued until the last
week of the instruction program.

A Final Tournament. A single-elimina-
tion tournament was held the last week
with competition in both divisions. A
match consisted of winning two or
three sets. Parents were invited to
the matches, and bleachers and park
benches were set up for spectators.
Full Participation. In both tourna-
ments, students who were not playing
participated by watching lines, keeping
score, and retrieving balls hit over the
backstops.

A Practice Batting Wall. The city, in
response to requests from the recreation
commission, constructed this adjacent
to the courts. Students who were not
playing took turns using the batting
wall to practice their strokes.

Good Publicity. Especially on our tour-
nament play; this appeared in the two
local newspapers. The recreation com~
mission also presented a five-minute ra-
dio program each week, which usually
included news of tennis activities.

Written Examinations for Students.
These were given four times during the
summer. They were only secondarily
aimed at teaching fundamentals and
knowledge of tennis terminology, and
were primarily used as unique, humor-
ous forms of instruction. The exams
consisted largely of questions in the
form of okes and were looked forward
to by the students. By not announcing
when they would be given until the pre-
vious day, expectation and interest were
built up.

Demonstrations. Throughout the sum-
mer, the two male instructors gave
weekly fifteen-to-twenty minute demon-
strations on the courts, concentrating
on fundamentals being emphasized for
that week. The students all looked for-
ward to these times, when they could
“see how they would soon be playing.”

Playground Program. Each Friday,
representatives from the tennis pro-
gram participated in the weekly play-
ground tournaments in various sports.
The tennis program was the only special
activity represented in this tournament
activity, in which the twenty regular
playgrounds competed for points and
the summer tournament championship.

End-of-the-Program Picnic. This was
held each summer, on the last day of
the final championship tournament.
The semi-final and final championship
matches in both divisions were played,
along with a match to decide the in-
structors’ championship. Trophies for
the winners in each division of both the
final and ladder tournaments were
awarded, and ribbons given for out-
standing sportsmanship and greatest
improvement in each division. All par-
ticipants were awarded certificates, and
parents were invited to attend.

Salina’s tennis program faces prob-
lems typical of those encountered in
smaller communities throughout the
country, and perhaps its pattern of op-
eration will be productive of ideas for
others. It has used an imaginative ap-
proach which has accomplished much,

cost very little. #

They worry about the dogeared grass
around city pounds and manicure the
city’s lawns. Who? Park and recrea-

are expected to juggle a myriad of du-
ties and be responsible for a great deal
of outdoor and indoor housekeeping
besides.

Take Norman S. Johnson, director of
parks and recreation for Los Angeles
County, California. His title does not
tell the full story of other duties cast
upon him by special ordinance of the
board of supervisors. Mr. Johnson is
actually the county’s ochial gardener
and, as such, he is responsible for
maintenance of hundreds of acres of
landscaping in scattered areas through-
out the county.

Not all of these facilities are strictly
within the scope of parks and recrea«
tion. If the property happens to belong
to the county and needs grounds mainte-
nance, the job usually is assigned to
Superintendent Johnson. Even if a plant
is located inside a county building, it

delegate duties and responsibility, so
the job of heading the grounds and

Then, there are the repair crews who
travel throughout the county to keep

Maintenance is not necessarily lim-

and planting flowers. Among the extra
duties of maintenance staff are caring
for barnyard animals and fowl at Wil-

LOCAL
DEVELOPMENTS

ALABAMA. An Army Engineers project on the Jackson

Reservoir in the southwest part of the state calls for con-
struction of recreation facilities at eight sites around the
reservoir on the lower Tombigbee River. To cost $140,000,
the project includes access roads, parking areas, and con-
crete boat launching ramps for public use. The sites are
located in an area considered the finest hunting and fish-
ing section in the state.

The State Department of Conservation is engaged in a
program to create a network of boat-launching facilities
throughout the state. Some forty-five facilities are already
in operation and another thirty sites are planned. Most of
the launching areas are about five acres in size and contain
a paved parking area for at least one hundred autos.

ALASKA. Three new national wildlife ranges have been

established in the new state. Total area involved is some
eleven million acres. The largest is the Arctic National
Wildlife Range of some nine million acres, habitat of such
“game” mammals as the rapidly dwindling grizzly and polar
bears, and the wolverine, Dall sheep, and caribou. Also
established were the Kuskokwim and Izembek National
Wildlife Ranges. The former comprises nearly two million
acres on the delta of the Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers, in
western Alaska. The latter contains about 415,000 acres
on the north side of the Alaska Peninsula.

The Kuskokwim Range includes immense expanses of
marsh and tundra land and is probably the greatest breed-
ing ground for waterfowl on the North American continent.
It is also the habitat of red and white foxes, otter, mink, and
muskrat, and is largely a wilderness.

The new Izembek Range on an isolated part of the Alaska
Peninsula, contains some 649 square miles, and is an im-
portant concentration point for enormous numbers of ducks,
geese, and shorebirds during spring and fall. It is a habitat

for brown bear and Stone’s caribou, among the larger
mammals.

CALIFORNIA. A 120-car-body artificial fishing reef has
been constructed off Rincon Island. Owned by the Richfield
Oil Corporation, the island is half a mile out in the ocean,
south of Santa Barbara. The reef, marked at its four corners

with buoys so anglers can locate it easily, is about fifty feet
below the surface and will not menace navigation. It has

316

been turned over to the state Department of Fish and Game '
for operation, maintenance, and study. I

o A beautiful new pool and fountain at the Los Angeles
State and County Arboretum entranceway has been made 1
possible by a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bauer of Pasa- .
dena, charter members of the California Arboretum Foun-
dation. Plans for the new entranceway were a further gift
from Millard Sheets, well-known artist-architect of Clare-
mont. The plans were developed in cooperation with Ed-
ward Huntsman-Trout, consulting landscape architect of the
arboretum and the Arboretum Foundation Planning Com-
mittee.

0 Boating enthusiasts in Southern California recently cele- r
brated the beginning of heavy construction for the Redondo
Beach King Small Craft Harbor. The celebration included
an old-fashiOned pit barbeque, a concert by El Toro Marine
Band, boat display, souvenir buttons, and balloons, all under
the coordination of Fred Tweedy, Redondo’s recreation and
parks director, and his staff. Honored guests included Con-
gressman Cecil R. King after whom the harbor was named.
Harbor development calls for three moles (breakwaters)
and several basins to handle ultimately over two thousand
boats, parking for thirty-one hundred cars, and twenty-six
areas of commercial zoning which will include hotels,
“boatels,” restaurants, automotive and boat service, and
pleasure fishing. One section of the harbor area will be de-
voted to a marine park and warm-water swimming lagoon.
Cost of the project is in excess of $10,000,000 but accord-
ing to Harbormaster Francis E. Hopkins, some of the costs
will be financed by oil revenue and receipts from slip rent-
als, parking, and other harbor and ground-lease income.

FLORIDA. Among the many new municipal golf courses
mushrooming across the state are the Orange Brook Munici-
pal Golf Course in Hollywood, making a total of three; an
additional short nine to the existing eighteen-hole Miami
Springs course; a nine-hole course in Ocala; and the eight-
een-hole LeJeune links in Miami. Courses now under con-
struction include an additional eighteen, at the Daytona
Beach city course, the first nine scheduled to open in Sep-
tember. Dade County has three eighteen-hole courses in the
planning stage for Crandon, Matheson Hammock, and Haul-
over Parks. Broward County plans an eighteen-hole county
course west of Ft. Lauderdale. Pompano Beach is planning
an additional eighteen and hopes to get construction under
way this summer. Pensacola is constructing its second
eighteen-hole course near the airport four miles northeast
of the city. Homestead and Patrick Air Force Bases each
have nine-hole golf courses under construction with opening
date scheduled for this summer. Orlando Air Force Base
is constructing a nine-hole links. The Chemstrand Corpora-
tion in Pensacola reports that construction will begin soon

on its golf course for use of its six thousand employees. \

Fort Walton Beach is planning a three hundred-acre park
which will include a eighteen-hole golf course, combination
golf clubhouse and bathhouse, swimming pool, large ath-
letic field with five ball diamonds, an organized camp, fish-

ing area, tennis courts, picnic areas, and bridle trails.

RECREATION ‘

0 One thousand acres of uninhabited land dotted with cy-
press trees has been made available without charge to the
Florida Audubon Society by American Cyanamid Company
for use as a wading bird sanctuary. The land, formerly
used in the company’s phosphate mining operations, has
been leased to the society to be used as a nesting place for
such famous bird species as the wood ibis and the American
egret. More than ninety percent of the wood ibis, the only
stork in North America, nest in Florida, as do close to eighty
percent of the American egrets, the most spectacular of all
US. wading birds. The new refuge has been named the

Saddle Creek Bird Sanctuary.

0 As the result of a successful $75,000 building fund drive,
the Children’s Museum in Tallahassee will open next fall
in a new building on a ten-acre lake site about fifteen min-
utes by car from the downtown area. The museum build-
ing, designed in a cluster of small-scaled structures resem-
bling an early settlement, will blend in with an Indian village
and early pioneer North Florida village also planned for the
area.

0 The space age has caught up with a municipal park in
Miami. Youngsters at the Grapeland Heights recreation
center have two toy sixteen-foot guided missiles complete
with launching pads to play with. There’s also a nine-foot
“control tower” and a seven-foot “space platform.” All are
custom-built to go with a former Navy Neptune plane do-
nated to the playground by the government last January.

Kelly Kaul, president of Game-Time Playground Equip-
ment Company, Litchfield, Michigan, donated the toys, val-

ued at $2,000. The giftsw—plane and toys—came about

through the efforts of a group of Eastern Air Lines pilots,
headed by Miamian Jim Matthews. Pilot Matthews con-
vinced the Navy it should send the Neptune fighter-bomber
to the Miami park instead of an Arizona graveyard.

KENTUCKY. Federal and local funds totaling nearly one

and a quarter million dollars have been authorized for the
construction of two dams within the Little River Flood

A venerable sternwheeler that plied the Upper Mississippi
River for jifty-six years has been converted into a Steam-
boat Museum, berthed on the levee in downtown Winona,
Minnesota, which celebrates “Steamboat Days” every July.

and create recreation areas. The watershed area will cover
more than thirty-seven thousand acres lying along the north
fork of Little River in Christian County.

MAINE. The Portland City Planning Board has approved
construction of a nine-hole par-3 golf course in Payson Park
to cost $16,800. Planners feel the new smaller course will
be more beneficial than nine more holes at heavily used
Riverside course. The par-3 may be in play in 1962.

tablished by former Governor Percival P. Baxter will pro-
vide perpetual care for Baxter State Park, the 194,000-acre
tract of wildland also given the state by Governor Baxter.
It is his intent that the area be preserved in its primitive
state, a reservation for the public to enjoy and a refuge for

wildlife.

NEW YORK. During the past year Rye has been making
additions and improvements to its Youth Recreation Center.
Recreation Superintendent Ralph’ Damiano reports that a
large basement room was finished off as well as the retain-
ing wall, terrace, and rough grading of the surrounding
grounds. Much of the furniture and games equipment was
either donated by local residents and businessmen or pur-
chased by funds raised by the center’s teenage members.
The Ceres Garden Club has offered to landscape the center
this year. The Municipal Boat Basin has been increased to
accommodate 110 additional moorings and can now handle
285 boats. During the past year extensive dredging was
done, improvements were made in the office and toilet facili-
ties, harbor and channel improvements were made and a
metal storage building which was donated was installed and
put into operation.

0 Construction of the new children’s zoo in New Y or}:
C ity’s Central Park is now going full speed ahead after many
delays due mostly to inclement weather. The zoo is a $500,-
000 gift to the city from former Governor Herbert H. Leh-
man and Mrs. Lehman in commemoration of their fiftieth
wedding anniversary. It will cover a one-acre site adjacent

to the present zoo.

The Lehman Zoo for Children joins an impressive list of
recreation facilities donated to Central Park: the outdoor
artificial skating rink from the Wollman Foundation (the
late Miss Kate Wollman was an honorary member of the
National Recreation Association), which also has given
$300,000 for a similar rink in Prospect Park, Brooklyn;
the children’s pony track from the Altman Foundation; a

DEVELOPING A POOL SCHEDULE

John M. Klang

HE EASIEST WAY to increase the
T use of your swimming pool is to
make it available to more peo-

ple, and to keep swimmers interested
with a variety of activities. The Warren
Consolidated Pool, one of the largest in-
door high school pools in Michigan, has
been able to do this successfully. This
pool, operated from 77 to 84 hours a
week all year for the residents of this
suburban Detroit community, averages

your pool schedule to include all age
groups and interests. (Illustration from
How to Teach Yourself and Your Fam-
ily to Swim Well, Simon & Schuster.)

a daily attendance of better than three
hundred swimmers, and on hot summer
days attendance may reach eleven hun-
dred.

In our job of helping more people
swim better, we have found that proper
scheduling is important. When plan-
ning a new schedule for your own pool,
the needs of your community must be
considered. If swimming facilities are
a new addition to your community there
will be many non-swimmers and begin-
ners. Today, more people participate in
aquatic activities than ever before.
More people have cottages, boats, take

trips and vacations on or near water, I

and new artificial pools and lakes have
been developed through bond issues

 

MR. KLANG is director of swimming at
the Warren Consolidated Schools in
Warren, Michigan.

Let’s think of our facilities in terms of people

and special assessments in the form of
local taxes.

How To Plan a Schedule

After determining the needs of the
community and the purpose for your
pool, keep the following things in mind
when forming a new schedule.

1. Be sure that every person you
serve has a chance to swim each day.
2. Offer instructions for every inter-

ning before dark. Adults usually will
attend better after 8:30 PM.
9. Consider bus schedules and rush
hour traffic when scheduling classes.
10. If you find dead spots in the pro-
gram, assign Special interest groups and
small classes to these hours.
11. Allow time for dressing and
showering, and be sure you have enough
locker facilities. If there are consecu-

tive large classes, lockers will be needed

 

est, age, ability, and sex.

3. Maintain uniformity with other
beaches, pools, schools, and camps by
following the American Red Cross class
outlines.

4. Provide for a progression from
one class level to another.

5. Have a goal or chance for reward
at the end of each season. This may be
an American Red Cross certificate, a
display of newly learned skills, or com-
petition against other swimmers.

6. Give teenagers a social outlet in
addition to physical activity. Teenage
splash parties are fun. Use underwater
liglits only and play pOpular records.

7. Emphasize each class or swim pe-
riod equally as part of the total pro-
gram.

8. Schedule youngsters for use of
the pool during the day or early eve-

simultaneously. Usually one class show-
ers and dresses while the other swims.

12. Try to stagger the use of locker
rooms to keep the number of locker
room attendants to a minimum.

13. Schedule open swimming or fam-
ily periods at the same time each day to
lend uniformity to the program.

After considering these suggestions
and formulating a pool program, have
a stranger read the schedule. If he un—
derstands it, make copies of the entire
schedule available to the public. You
may also want to publish a copy in the
local newspaper each week in the enter-
tainment section. As a director, do your
best to insure that these schedules are
followed. Frequent changes will hurt
attendance, for the public seldom knows
about them until they have been refused
a chance to swim.

NOTES FOR

Immunity

According to the Virginian Pilot, four suits totalling

$170,000 against the city of Portsmouth, the Portsmouth
School Board, and a high-school athletic association were
dismissed in the City Circuit Court on April 20th. The
suits resulted from the collapse of bleachers at a basketball
game in a school gymnasium. The company that manufac-
tured the bleachers, a co-defendant, was exempted from the
dismissal. Demurrers for the city school board and athletic
association contended that inter-scholastic athletic pro-
grams are a governmental function for which there is no
corporate liability. In dismissing the suits against the three

defendants, the judge sustained their demurrers claiming
governmental immunity.

Wake Up, Somebody, Anybody!

Park and recreation authorities threatened with encroach-
ment will appreciate the following excerpts from a recent
editorial in the Saturday Evening Post.

“For more than a century American cities have been
proud of their parks. But unless somebody wakes up soon,
most of those quiet green spaces amid the tall buildings will
be only memories. The big land rush which has been gob-
bling up the suburbs around the cities is now threatening
irreplaceable park lands inside the cities themselves. . . .

“Given the choice of taking a row of tenements or slicing
a chunk off a park, most engineers and politicians will reach
for the park. Tenement dwellers squawk. Park enthusiasts
do not squawk quite so loudly. But the thing to remember
is that new housing can easily be built. New parks cannot.
If our cities continue to sacrifice their parklands, they will
become concrete jungles without much beauty or ability to

check the Hight to the suburbs.”

Dedicated Like Crazy

In responding to inquiries about his report for the forth-

. coming 1961 Recreation and Park Yearbook the recreation

executive in a small Ohio community commented: “Being
a small-town recreation director calls for a man who is
either dedicated or crazy and I don’t know which I am now
-—just give us a couple more hours in the day and maybe
some day we can make everyone happy and proud of the
progress we have made.”

Public Patronage

In an address at the University of Michigan, Dr. Luther
Gulick of the Institute for Public Administration pointed
out areas in which the laissez-faire marketing mechanism
fails to meet the needs of modern cities: “Education and
Cultural Activities” was listed as an area where a few ac-
tivities can always be organized for profit, such as specta-

tor sports and commercial theatres. Dr. Gulick added there

are still many avenues of service for generous and imagina-
tive philanthropy, but any mass education, recreation, or
cultural enjoyment can be provided only with extensive
public patronage and support of all kinds, running all the
way from tax exemption to public construction of facilities
and direct public tax support of certain activities.

Rewards of Foresight
According to Land For The Future by Marion Clawson,

R. Burnell Held, and Charles H. Stoddard, published by
John Hopkins Press for Resources for the Future ($8.50) :
“Planning for recreation must be in terms of the physical
requirements and possibilities, the economic values and
costs, the governmental interrelationships, and the financial
needs and possibilities. Perhaps in no other field of gov-
ernmental activity are the financial rewards of foresight
greater than in acquisition of land for recreation well be-
fore the need becomes acute. . . .”

The Lineup

Executives responsible for the operation of golf courses
may have problems and tense times, but few of them are
faced with the pressure felt by users of municipal courses
in New York City. The New Y or]: Times Magazine recently
showed a picture of golfers lined up at a Queens course at
4:45 AM. It reported that the first man in line one morning

arrived at 3:15, registered at 5:30, and teed off at 6:00. A
tardy fellow who showed up at 4:40 was seventy-fifth in line!

Planning as a Whole
In St. Paul, Minnesota, all proposals for capital improve-

ments in the fields of parks, recreation, and schools are
reviewed by a standing committee composed of the super-
intendent of parks, the assistant superintendent of schools
in charge of business affairs, the executive director of the
planning board, and the manager of parks and recreation
(Robert Lobdell). According to the last named, the rela-
tionship of the parks and recreation program to the public
schools presents a real challenge, “Until we sit down and do
a better job of joint planning, we will not provide the serv-
ice to the best of our ability that the taxpayer deserves.”

‘

Subtle Destruction .
Dr. Abel Wolman, director emeritus of samtary engineer-

ing at Johns Hopkins University, stated in an address before
the American Public Health Association: “Perhaps the en-
gineers who plow under vast green areas for the super-
super-highway and who pile brick upon brick upon urban
and suburban areas devastated by the excavating machine
are as subtly destructive to man as our once familiar Ty-

phoid Mary was.”

q ccoamnc TO A SURVEY made by
John Collier, National Recreation

Association district representative in
the Pacific Southwest, the demand for
workers in California, Utah, and Ariz-
ona will remain strong for the next two
years. The public recreation depart-
ments estimate that they will have re-
cruited a total of 895 full-time, year-
round workers for the year ending July
1, 1961. Of these, 559 vacancies are
replacements and 336, newly created
jobs. In addition, the departments an-
ticipate they will employ 9812 summer
employees and 532 for the school year.

The majority of the full-time, year-
round positions require an AB. degree
or better, with a number of the cities
indicating that those holding a Master’s
degree would receive a somewhat high-
er salary. The present starting salaries

HE RECREATION agencies were also

asked to estimate the number of
vacancies they would be filling in the
year ending July 1, 1962. Strangely
enough, the employment situation ap-
pears to be about the same as that for
the preceding year and is as. follows:
For the year ending July 1, 1962 cm-
ploying agencies expect to recruit for
861 full-time, year-round positions.

Four hundred of these represent newly
created positions, while 461 vacancies
are expected to occur due to turnover.
In addition the employers anticipate the
hiring of 10,310 summer leaders and
593 for the school year. The demand
appears to be strong for both men and
women, although there may be a slight-
ly larger number of vacancies for men.

Predictions of recreation executives
and employing agencies in the past have
been reasonably accurate; consequent-

= ly, we may expect recruiting efforts, at

least in the Pacific Southwest, to in-
crease considerably in the next two
years. This condition is likely to affect
other parts of the country as well, since
Western employers, in many instances,
have ignored geographical boundaries,
sending recruiting teams clear to the
East Coast.

source you had to lock it up and keep it from being
used. In the case of renewable'natural resources—*soil,
water, forests, grasslands, fish, wildlife—t0 conserve has
now come to mean to use wisely. This implies the develop-
ment and application of management practices ( based on
continuing research) designed to produce and maintain an
abundance of these resources sufficient to permit heavy use
yet provide for their continued abundance year after year.
With respect to sport .fish it means that fishery biologists
must learn all they can about fish populations and devise
and apply fish management practices that will assure satisfy-
ing catches of fish year after year to increasing numbers of
anglers.

Unfortunately, from the standpoint of sport fishing, many
of the factors that control land and water use are beyond
the direct control of the biologists. They cannot, for ex-
ample, veto a proposal to construct a highway that may
affect an outstanding bass or trout stream. Similarly, they

cannot veto the construction of a large reservoir that may

If you wanted to conserve a re-

be needed for water supply or hydro-electric purposes.

But if they are suitably armed with facts about the eco-
nomic value of retail business generated by the fishermen
in pursuit of their sport, and can provide reasonable esti-
mates of fishing use under the present and future conditions,
they can often cause favorable modifications of plans that
would otherwise produce great damage to fishing. Spawn-
ing areas may be provided, needed minimum flows may be
guaranteed, or any one of a number of modifications under-
taken that will assure provision of abundant good fishing
even though it may be of a different character.

For example, a warm-water stream will be profoundly
affected by construction of a high dam. One kind of con-
struction design may result in superior reservoir fishing for
bass, crappies. walleyes, etcetera, above the dam and a new
and spectacular Goldwater fishery for trout below the dam.
Another kind of construction design would result in poor
fishing in the reservoir above the dam and continued tra-
ditional fishing downstream, though reduced to the extent
of its flooding by the reservoir.

SOME FOLKS are much disturbed by attempts to develop
dollar \alues for sport fishing. believing that the true
importance of fishing is intangible and therefore. not meas-

urable. However, the fact that fishing is the contemplative
sport does not mean that a minimum evaluation of the
goods and services used when fishing cannot be made and
compared to other values computed in similar fashion. All
who fish for sport will probably agree that such figures are
minimum values at best. Nevertheless, the single common
denominator in use for measuring the place of various com-
peting interests in a multipurpose project is the dollar. We
must recognize it, like it or not. If we ignore this fact and
fail to develop minimal values, sport fishing interests will
not be considered in project planning. It is as simple as
that and boils down to “do or die.”

Indeed, it has been only since 1955, when the first na-
tional economic survey of fishing and hunting was con-
ducted under sponsorship of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, that fishing and hunting have begun to win signifi-
cant consideration in overall resource planning. In that
study the remarkable discovery was made that there were
one or more fishermen or hunters in one out of every three
US. households. Further, one in every four men and one
in every eleven women fished.

The 20,800,000 people who fished in 1955 spent the im-
pressive sum of $1,900,000,000 for oil, gasoline, and other
travel costs (food, drink, lodging), for equipment (boats,
motors, fishing tackle and accessories, Special clothing,
camping and picnic gear, etcetera) , and for special fees and
fishing licenses. This exceeded the total ($1,700,000,000)
spent by Americans for admissions to all spectator amuse-
ments (movies, legitimate theaters, opera, and all kinds of
spectator sports) .

Individually, average annual expenditures came to $91.98
per angler. If he fished in fresh water his expenditures
averaged $77.38. If he fished in salt water they averaged
$107.29 ($91.18 on the East and Gulf Coast; $155.74 on
the West Coast). Altogether, Americans devoted nearly
400,000,000 man-days to pursuit of their favorite means of
relaxation outdoors—with about 339,000,000 of them on
fresh water.

If an angler can do his fishing locally, he can avoid sub-
stantial travel costs. In fact, about thirty percent of all
anglers were found to fish within a range of one hundred
miles of home. Availability of nearby fishing facilities,

322

  
 
    
   
   
  
 
   
 
 
 
   

therefore, makes it possible to enjoy fishing more ec
nomically than average.

UNDERLYING THIS, however, it is the sure knowledge th
the fishing to be provided must be good—“or the f
cility will not be utilized. For the fishing to be good—t
key to success—“there must be intensive scientific manag
ment based on extensive research. An outstanding examp
of this is the public fishing lake program of the Alaba
Conservation Department. Sixteen lakes, comprising 8
surface acres of water, have been constructed and inte
sively managed for public fishing for periods of up to eig
years or more. Time has shown that, with increasing
heavy use, the desirable size is two hundred acres or mo
per lake. Records for twelve of these lakes older than t
years (the first year gives a distorted picture of what fishin
will be like so that records for the four newest lakes are 11
included) show that much sustained good fishing has be
created in Alabama on an economically feasible basis.

Annually, for the twelve lakes, there were more than 16
fishing trips (man-days) per acre resulting in an averag
harvest per acre exceeding 174 pounds of fish. The lowed
annual utilization recorded for any of these twelve lakei
was 89 individual fishing trips per acre; the highest W4
242 trips.

It seems reasonable to assume that a properly constructed
intensively managed lake of comparable size near large
population centers in Virginia can also support 150 or more
man-days of fishing per acre each year. Such a lake "
scheduled for construction on South Run and OpossuII
Branch near the town of Burke in Fairfax County. It wil
be the 210-acre Burke Lake, first such facility to be built it
Northern Virginia by the Commission of Game and Inland
Fisheries. If it draws only from the estimated forty thous
and anglers in Fairfax County, Arlington County, Fall:
Church, and Alexandria, fishing use may Well quickly ex
ceed 150 per acre, or more than thirty thousand tot
annually. In all, then, at least $63,000 per year will b
spent locally by anglers using the lake for oil and gasoline
fishing tackle and other sporting goods, and parking fees
bait, etcetera, at filling stations, stores and concessions i1
the area. In the course of a single generation, this one lak¢
will generate retail business amounting to more thaI
$1,250,000! Few acres managed in any other way can yielt
so much dollar value—or such incredibly valuable therap]
for tense minds. For the chief value of fishing lies in th¢
unique fact that it, above all others, is the “contemplative’

sport. #

GAMESCAPE YOUR YARD

UR BACKYARDS HAVE gone adult
0 and in a most unusual way—
converted to private play-
grounds, they are among the nation’s
most frequented year-round vacation
spots. Landscaped into suburban Amer-

‘ The latter years’ resurgence of bad-
minton, horseshoes, and shufHeboard is

based in the backyard. So is the boom-
ing popularity of tetherball, archery,
lawn bowling, garden golf (a single
green sufficing for the usual nine), and
volleyball. Many a traditional indoor
game has been carried out-of-doors.
‘Typical is backyard chess, its “board,”
a six-b'y-six-foot slab of concrete or as-
phalt, its mobile “men” three feet tall
and trundled move-to-move by ambula-

Big enough for Sportive fun is the
low-cost family pool—in-ground or
plastic and portable—which, even in a
small yard, leaves room enough for
darts,~quoits, and horseshoes. Or, you
may prefer sharing your play, as do
three families in California’s San Fer-
nando Valley whose adjacent yards af-
ford to all what no one could afford
alone.

One homeowner installed a gunited
15-by-30-foot swimming pool (cost:
about $2500). A second family game-
scaped its back lawn for one-hole golf,
croquet, scoopball, horseshoes, and boc-
cie, an Italian variation of lawn bowl-
ing. And a quarter of the lawn was

Planning for Family Fun

So let’s plan your private playground
—fitted to every member of the family.
Not everybody will like every game.
But there must be games and play for
everyone—tyke, teenager, and those
three-score-and-ten. Then, too, you
want variety. Swatting a shuttlecock
can grow tiring—even exhausting. No
one should ever play to the point of
fatigue. “Hard play, for the normal
healthy individual, is fine . . . for a
while,” comments one physician, “but
no one should play too hard too long.
Play should be menued . . . an appetizer
of strenuous . . . and a bit of energetic
play as a kind of recreational dessert.”

The myriad of backyard games avail-
able to every family and every family
budget fall, generally, into three play
categories: (1) action games—fast and
competitive sports, which range from
jai alai-type games, to small-fry ver-

covered models are available for use on athletic fields and
playgrounds for player protection. These Rain Birds do a
thorough, scientific watering job, then quietly disappear—
as if by magic—into the ground so they offer no obstruction
to the beauty or usability of the turf area. Sprinklers are
designed to be installed flush with the ground so there is
no hole to trip those walking or playing on the turf.

A heavy-duty retractor spring on the sliding pop-up
member assures positive closing of the sprinkler when the
pressure is off and, for ease of maintenance, the entire in-
ternal assembly is removable from the top without removing
the case from the riser. For catalogue, circle #100.

A DRAMA ON RETIREMENT, Ever Since April
by Nora Stirling is a new play in the Plays
for Living Series. It has been published as a
public service by the American Association of
Retired Persons, Dupont Circle Building,
Washington, DC. The use of drama in the
form of a simple, realistic play that presents
a problem from several points of view is an
excellent technique for stimulating interest
and encouraging discussion on the problems
of retirement and old age. Performance is
authorized by securing a 3.50 production
packet of live copies from the sponsor. Single
copies of the script and discussion guide are
available for perusal without charge.

sions of basketball; (2) skill games
which require muscle coordination and
accuracy rather than raw energy: arch-
ery, skish (bait casting at circular tar-
gets), and quoits; (3) leisurely games
—slower paced sports which require
some energy and skill but afford wel-
come relief from the fast-and-furious
competitiveness of many a backyard
game.

If you have a large yard (the half-

acre and larger variety), you can plan
I and segregate one type of‘sport from
another—affording privacy to each age
group. Some games belong together.
Others don’t. You wouldn’t, for exam-
ple, want badminton so close to the pool
that shuttlecocks take a swim every now
and then. Neither do you want toddlers
Within,easy reach of the pool. On the
other hand, more leisurely, non-aerial
games—lawn bowling for one—can
safely sidle almost to the water’s edge.

Says a spokesman for the National

Recreation Association, “When the fam-
ily has gone into a huddle, and decided
what it would like to have, the time has
come to ‘gamescape’.” Oddly, in game-
scaping, the average homeowner must
work backwards—think first not of spe-

} ciflc games but of space. For unless
your yard is expansive or you’re build-
ing a new home, you’ve got to fit games
to what area you have. And usually,

' you must fudge both on rules and regu-
lations.

“When planning family play,” ex-
plains one landscape architect, “a
homeowner would do well to walk
around his premises a bit.” A surpris-

ing suggestion? Perhaps. But the truth
| is few know their own yards—play-wise.

One family “discovered” that a ga-
I rage wall, long neglected as useless,

made an ideal backstop for modified
| handball. A side lot, only six feet wide,
has been turned to play by one family.
I Safely isolated from the rest of the yard,
' it’s been converted to a dart range.
But the most overlooked game area
of all—and the least costly to adapt for
n play—is the driveway and car turn-
around area. Most building codes rule
I eight feet as minimum driveway width,
though the average is nine feet wide and

JUNE, 1961

many built today span ten to twelve feet.
Just as many—perhaps yours among
them—are at least thirty feet long (nor
are 50- to 100-foot driveways unusual).
The turn-around area near the garage
may be twenty to forty feet wide and
from thirty to fifty feet long. Even at
minimum, your drive represents no less
than one hundred square feet of poten-
tial play area.

Almost any turn-around spans six
hundred square feet, and usually it’s as-
phalted or paved . . . and big enough
for a tetherball court, badminton, hop-
scotch, and one-goal basketball.

How much should the small-yard lay-
out cost? Actually, $25 usually covers
the few purchased necessities: tether-
ball set, with a top-mounted basketball
goal; a cotton twine net, which serves
for all the net sports, and a serviceable
volleyball or general play ball; $10 to
$12 for cues and discs adds shuflle-
board. A few dollars more and the same
playlarea is turned to horseshoes. Use
rubber horseshoes if playing on a con-
crete surface.

But the most rewarding novelty in
backyard America is the convertible
slab—some call it a multi-play court.
It permits you to play a number of
games in the same recreation area.
Game boundaries are striped with traf-
fic lacquer, a different color for every
sport. Net standards or poles——-—which
fit into metal sleeves sunk flush with the
slab’s surface—are quickly removable.
In seconds you can convert to another
game.

If you haven’t space for the “regula-
tion” 30-by-60-foot slab, no matter. You
can adapt it to your own yard by whit-
tling it down to fit what play space you
have.* Asphalt, concrete, and even clay
will serve equally well for the slab itself.
For maximum space economy, throw
game regulations to the wind and turn
your driveway into an all-purpose
court. This is one prescription every
family can write safely for itself!

For Perfect Circles

Laying out circles on your play slab
can be done easily and accurately with

a homemade compass that traces per-
fect circles stripe-wide and of any de-

 

*F or list of games, write National Rec-
reation Association, 8 West Eighth.
Street, New York 11.-——Ed.

sired diameter. The compass does what
string can’t do: assures that your circle-
tracing pencils are held rigid, perpen-
dicular, and forever the same distance
from the play court’s center.

To lay out a twenty-foot-diameter

tetherball court, you need only a half-
diatneter length of weed, one-by-one
inch; a three-eighth-inch drill; two pen-
cils, and a collar piece which, screwed
or nailed to one end of your compass,
fits the court’s center-pole (as in tether-
ball) or stake.

The collar pictured here is a four-
inch length of corrugated stripping, the

your compass pole. The one-hy-one-
inch compass can be a single piece

diameter circles) or. as shown here,

several garden stakes nailed to make the
required length.

For most play court circles, you’ll
want an inch-wide line. To make it,
simply measure nine feet, eleven inches
out from the center-pole along your
compass. Mark the spot. Measure an-
other inch outward and mark again.

Now drill holes through both points
—they’re an inch apart, thus assuring
an inch-wide court line. Holes should
be sized for whatever pencils you plan
to use. Most pencils fit snugly into a
three-eighth-inch hole. Some, larger,
require a hole half to five-eighth inch
in diameter. Place tracing pencils in
the compass’ inch-apart holes and, as
the compass turns on its collar around
your center-pole, trace the play court.

Result: a perfect twenty-foot-diame-
ter circle, its traced and ready-to-paint
stripe exactly an inch wide. Though
fastdrying traffic lacquer is tedious to
brush on, it’ll stand up better with play
and weather than house paints or or-
dinary enamels.

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

'i‘ The two-year Sheltered Workshop
Project of the National Recreation As-
sociation Consulting Service on Recre-
ation for the Ill and Handicapped will
be completed by the end of June. A
limited number of copies of the final
report will be available shortly there-
after. A total of 240 sheltered workshop
clients participated in this study made
possible by a grant from the U. S. Office
of Vocational Rehabilitation. Recom-
mendations for action to meet the recre-
ation needs of these handicapped work-
ers were formulated on the basis of their
statements about what they would like
to do in their free time.

In the final report of this project, an

attempt has been made to present the”

material in all ways that will permit va-
rious types of sheltered workshops
throughout this country to identify
specifically with one of twelve ‘case
studies. Each of these studies presents
a particular kind of setting and situa-
tion representative of similar conditions
existing in typical communities. Having
identified with any one of the cases
presented, a sheltered workshop will
then be able to determine what kind of
responsibility it can reasonably expect
itself to assume in contributing to the
social rehabilitation of its clients.

’f‘ In April,the advisory committee of
the Consulting Service’s Homebound
Project joined twenty-six formerly
“homebound” patients in a “Salute to
Spring” party in the auditorium at
NRA headquarters. The total number
of patients now involved in the project
is eighty-two. Many have been isolated
at home for twenty to thirty years. With
the help of forty volunteers, the project
staff provides these patients with in-
dividual and group activity. So far,
only twelve of the patients have re-
mained passive—and even these admit
that they do look forward to seeing the
recreation workers several days a week.
Of the seventy actively involved pa-
tients, seven have made such tremend-
ous progress—in less than a year of
service—that they are now ready to

+ The Fifth Regional Institute on Hos-
pital Recreation was held in April at
the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill. The program was built on
the theme of “Expanding Horizons,”
and included four workshOps on pro-
gram, personnel, facilities, and evalu-
ation. Doris Berryman, the NRA
representative, gave a talk on “Manage-
ment Maturity” and served as a re-
source person for the personnel
workshop.

'f‘ A four-week program for training
volunteers to serve as recreation aides

“- in nursing homes has been carried out

for the first time in the state of Con-
necticut, sponsored by the state depart-
ment of health._ Representatives from
the NRA Consulting Service and from
Comeback, Inc. collaborated to conduct
one of the workshops offered in the
program and put on a dramatic demon-
stration of how to organize and conduct
a one-hour party in a nursing home.
They took the trainees right along with
them into a nursing home where neither
of the demonstrators had ever been be-
fore, and in one morning planned and
expedited the party, which was held
that very afternoon. Music, group sing-
ing, patient rhythm band, square danc-
ing, refreshment, and party favors were
en oyed by all.

+ Another first is the inservice train-
ing course in recreation for the chron-
ically ill and handicapped which is
available to recreation directors of the
San Francisco Recreation and Park De-
partment. San Francisco appears to be
leading the field in this area of com-
munity service.

'i‘ . . . and this brings us to a reiteration
of our request that readers of this col-
umn send us news of programs and
trends that may be setting precedents
in communities throughout the country.
If you know of a program going on in
your community’s hospitals, other in-
stitutions, rehabilitation centers, agen-
cies, or organizations that has a new
approach or has been of special value in
meeting the recreation needs of the ill
and handicapped of the community,
please send us the information. We
would like to publish such news in this
column as it could be of help in en-
couraging others to expand their hori-

zons.

ing their craft and check each boat carefully to see that it
is properly equipped and not overloaded.

ALTHOUGH gunk-hole cruising in itself offers some of the
best boating fun, clubs often plan special cruises, such
as:

Mystery Cruise: A regular cruise, but only the date, time
and place for launching are announced to members. Only
the cruise master knows the route and destination. This
is especially interesting if a new cruise route never before
covered is selected.

Camera Cruise: The camera bugs are given an opportunity
to combine their hobbies with a cruise specially scheduled
to an area abounding in scenic and historic spots of interest.
F isheree: A cruise to a notable fishing hole, with prizes
awarded for the club member catching the first, largest, and
smallest fish.

Many other types of cruises are also held by clubs whose
members have special interests, such as water skiing or skin
diving; and every one of them is geared to bring the best
and most fun out of boating ownership.

If you would like to receive additional information on
gunk-holing or other types of cruises, a list of clubs in your
area, or instructions on how to organize a cruising boating
club, write to the Outboard Boating Club of America, 307
North Michigan Avenue, Chicago 1, Illinois. #

PENNSYLVANIA. Delaware County, which recently ap-

proved a bond issue for parks and recreation purposes in-
cluding golf, plans two par-3 golf courses in each of two pro-
posed county parks. The county, which has a population of
550,000, has only one nine-hole tax-supported course at
present.

0 The Bucks County Park Board plans to include golf
courses in its proposed county park program. The county
recently approved a $5,000,000 bond issue which includes
$1,500,000 for land acquisition and county parks, including
golf facilities. Plans have already been approved for three
swimming pools ($190,000) for the Erst park project.

TEXAS. During 1960 Fort Worth constructed four swim-
ming pools at a total cost of approximately $106,000. Each
of the pools is 36’-by-60' at the shallow end and 20'-by-36'
at the deep end with a depth of nine feet.

THE 16mm CRAB BAG

THIS WEEK more than eight million
people will go to the movies—but
they wonit be going to the theater. They
will instead be gathered in schools and
church halls, at service club luncheons
or afternoon meetings of local garden
clubs, in sessions of community-spon-
sored safe driving or recreation pro-
grams. There they will learn to wrap
a gift, buy and cook beef, build a boat,
square dance, hunt big game, catch a
cold, or get a good night’s sleep; study
the problems of modern Burma or the
history of ancient Mesopotamia; ex-
plore the wonders of the world and the
traditions and culture of its peoples——
all through the medium of 16MM mo-
tion pictures sponsored by leading bus-
iness and industrial firms across the
country.

These viewers are part of the so-called
nontheatrical film audience (schools
and colleges, clubs, business and in-
dustrial groups, churches, synagogues,
et a1) toward which business and indus-
try last year alone beamed fifty-four
hundred film productions. Result: a
new bulge in a film grab bag already
filled with informative and entertaining
productions dealing with culture, arts
and crafts and many other subjects of
interest to directors of recreation pro-
grams. ‘

Produced by professional craftsmen
and sprinkled with such stars as Jimmy
Stewart, Alan Ladd, Dinah Shore, and
Jerry Lewis, these films range alphabet-
ically from accident prevention to zoos
and in content from how to cook a
hamburger to how to avoid atomic fall-
out. And many of them are available
for the price of return postage on the

film.

Film Reservoir

Through the medium of just a few of
the “free” films listed by one distrib-
utor, for example, a. recreation group
could study the ceremonial dances and
tribal chants of Africa; take a lei-
surely bus tour of America; learn how
to bathe a baby, prepare jams and jel-

JUNE, 1961

lies 0r operate a car; or take a short
course in woodworking or ceramics.
Series of films, such as the award-
winning CBS-News “Twentieth Cen-
tury” programs are also available, as
are films on how to organize and con-
duct effective recreation programs.
Whatever the special interest of the
group, however, there is something of
interest in this immense film reservoir.

Perhaps the most complete listing
of film sources available to recreation
groups is found in A Directory of 3660
16mm Film Libraries, published by the
U. S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare (available for $1.00 from
Superintendent of Documents, Wash-
ington 25, D. C.) The 236-page book
lists each film source and the number
of films available from each. Sources
are broken down by states and cities
and towns within states. The sources

include state departments and commis-'

sions, insurance companies, airlines,
manufacturers, business associations,
oil companies, and foreign govern-

ments. #

Creative Paper Design, Ernst Rottger.
Reinhold Publishing Company, 430
Park Avenue, New York 22. Pp. 96,
illustrated. $4.00.

If this book seems expensive, the
reader should consider that over 270
examples of projects made by young
boys and girls and by adults attending
training courses are used for the basic
information in this book. Words are
kept at a minimum. The photographs
by Dieter Klante are amazing in their
capture of the element of creativity and
child enjoyment.

This book, printed in Holland, is
beautiful in format, paper, print, and
illustrations. Artists, craft teachers,
recreation leaders, anyone who is al-
ready convinced of the flexibility of
paper as an art and craft medium, or
anyone needing conviction, should add
this book as a real treasure to his li-
brary. This is the first in Reinhold’s
Creative Play series. Others in prepara-
tion are Creative Wood Design, Crea-
tive Clay Design, and Creative Textile

Design.—V.M.

Let's-Read-And-Find-Out. Thomas
Y. Crowell Company, 432 Park Avenue
South, New York 16.

The five books in this new series are
the result of bringing together people
who know science and people who know
children. They are written and illus-
trated on shiny stock paper, using three
colors; each book is forty pages long
and attractively bound in 8%”- by 8”-
boards-——typical size. for early elemen-
tary-school-age youngsters. Each one
answers the curious “why” that young-
sters ask about the world, in simple
child language and with simple, delight-
ful illustrations. Parents, teachers, li-
brarians, and recreation leaders who
realize the importance of providing
basic science information early in child-
hood will welcome this series.

Entrances and Exits, Phyllis Fenner
and Avah Hughes, illustrated by Frank
Kramer. Dodd, Mead and Company,
432 Park Avenue South, New York 16.
Pp. 278. $3.75.

These fifteen plays were selected
especially for the ten-to-fourteen-year-
olds, the age when it becomes important
to be in a real play and appear before
an audience. The plays are‘delightful.
Some are based on old legends, such as
Dick Whittington and Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves. Among adaptations of
childhood favorites is Mr. Popper’s
Penguins. One of the most delightful is

the too-often forgotten Magic F ishbone,

by Charles Dickens. Many have been
dramatized by various grades of the
Lincoln School and are child-tested.

Readers who are familiar with Miss
Fenner’s thirty books know she is a li-
brarian and storyteller now retired to
Vermont, where she is busier than ever.
Avah Hughes, a member of the staE
of Lincoln School, Teachers College,
Columbia University, for twenty-one
years, now teaches the sixth grade of
Plandome Road School, Manhasset,
New York. A lovely collection for a
hard to please age-group.

Blind Children in Family and Com-
munity, Marietta B. Spencer. Univer-

sity of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis
14. Pp. 142. $4.25.

This is a picture book with clear,
brief explanations of how parents and
others can help blind children to be-
come useful, independent adults. The
pictures illustrate basic principles of
child guidance that can be applied to
blind or other handicapped children to
help them to develop as normally as
possible at home, in the neighborhood,
and in the community. They show blind
children of preschool age in various
situations that are common to all young-
sters, at play, going to bed, dressing,
visiting the playground, learning sim-

ple habits and skills, and so on. The
book was published with the aid of the

Hamm Foundation and the American
Foundation for the Blind.

The Family Book of Games, Richard
Kraus. McGraw-Hill Book Company,
330 West 42nd Street, New York 36.
Pp. .191, illustrated. $3.95.*

Here is a compilation of a wide vari-
ety of games, chosen for their adapt-
ability of use with family groups. The
games chosen will not be new to recrea-
tion leaders, but they probably will not
be familiar to the average Mr. and Mrs.
Parent. Since Dick Kraus knows rec-
reation, has good taste, and is experi-
enced in the writing of books, it will
surprise no one that his latest one is a
workmanlike job. It is worth better
paper, however, than the publisher
gives it, and its illustrative sketches
lack charm and individuality.

Music for Family Fun, Harriet Buxton
Barbour. E. P. Dutton, 300 Park Ave-
nue South, New York 10. Pp. 173.
$3.95.

This publication is a guide to worth-
while and first-hand musical experi-
ences from childhood through adult-
hood. Various singing, playing, listen-
ing, and creative activities are discussed
and outlined. An extensive list of sup-
plementary suggestions and resources
is also provided.

boards, Louise Binder Scott and J. J.
Thompson, illustrated by Jean Flowers.
Webster Publishing Company, 1154

Reco Street, St. Louis 26. Pp. 136.
$2.70.

Teachers and recreation leaders with
preschool and early elementary-age
youngsters are always looking for new
fingerplays and rhymes. They are valu-
able assets, useful in dramatic play and _
loaded with real educational value. This \
new collection, handsomely printed and J
beautifully illustrated, is an excellent
addition to the limited material avail-
able in these activities.

helps increase production. That's

a pretty good case for in-plant athletic
programs. Studies prove it out—plants with
I I I sports participation for employees

are more productive.

Just having the program isn’t enough, however. Your plant needs the right athletic program,
correctly planned and executed, and supplied with the right equipment. Your MacCregor dealer is an
expert on setting up and operating leagues of all kinds, and he certainly has the finest sports
equipment available right in his own store. He. can assist you with initial planning. scheduling,
tournament bracketing, selection of equipment, and even sanctioning by local athletic groups if
necessary. He’s also adept at giving tired old programs a vigorous boost. Get your plants athletic
program started, or rejuvenated, now. Keep your employees’ after-hours energies and tensions

in control by giving them controlled conflict. A call to your Mat-Gregor dealer, or a

a visit to his store, will get things moving. Do it today.
