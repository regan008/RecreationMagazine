The Role of Recreation

 

ubert  Crawford

VISIT to Independence Hall in
downtown Philadelphia cannot
iii to stir the soul of any man and give
im a Spiritual uplift, for here is lo-
Ited the Liberty Bell which is our sym-
ol of liberty and our most venerated
rmbol of patriotism. i
With the exception of the Liberty
ell itself, perhaps the most revered
nd awe-inspiring sight is the Colonial
.oom, which was originally occupied
y the Colonial Assembly of Pennsyl-
enia and later relinquished to the Con-
.nental Con’gress. From this room, 177
ears ago, was the first public reading
f the Declaration of Independence.
Although recreation as a recognized
overnmental responsibility was not
nitiated in any city until approximate-
y 125 years later, nevertheless it was
n this room that the foundation for the
ecreation profession was laid. Here,
he Constitution was written stating
hat all men are created equal and that
hey are endowed by their creator with
'ertain inalienable rights; that among
hese are life, liberty and the pursuit of
lappiness. This last phrase is the basis
)n which the recreation profession has
teen developed. we would like to think
hat the framers of our Constitution
had this thought in mind when they in-
serted the words “pursuit of happi-

SEPTEMBER 1953

ness.” Mankind has been seeking hap-
piness for centuries and this search for
a meaningful and purposeful life is the
goal of recreation people.

The possession of skills and tech-
niques alone are not sufhcient for a suc-
cessful recreation leader of today. He
should also understand the American
scene, the “ideals of the pe0ple,” as well
as become familiar with individual dif-
ferences, basic needs and, above all,
social goals. It would appear that an-
other function of the profession is to
recognize the dignity of each partici-
pant and to encourage each to develop
his own innate capacities to the fullest
so that he will be better equipped for
living in our free society.

Since mass leisure has hit us rather
suddenly, the question has becn raised
as to whether leisure may not be de-
stroyed and rendered meaningless by
its abundance. Surely, the positive
solving of this question is a challenge
to the recreation worker and probably
emphasizes the need of raising the
wholesome “leisure” capacity of a large
segment of our population.

Positive and joyful living has gone
out of the lives of some people and, as
a result, many have turned to all kinds
of wretched substitutes. Wholesome
and creative use of oE-the-job or lei-
sure time should be of major concern
to government on all levels, because

It is appropriate that our editorial for this Congress Issue of RECREATION should
be written by Bob Crawford. As deputy commissioner and superintendent of rec-

reation in Philadelphia, this thoughtful and energetic recreation executive extends
a cordial invitation to all of us for the Philadelphia Congress in September.

 

the culture of our society hangs in the
balance. Proper use of our leisure is as
important as our basic freedoms and
standards of living.

Perhaps, this could be best expressed
in the words of the late theologian,
Peter Marshall,_when he said, “It is
not the length of life that matters but
how it is lived. That is the thing that
counts. It is not. how long, but how
wel .” So it is in recreation, not how
much but how good is it and what is
happening to the people as a result of
the participation? Arc they better pre-
pared for living in this great democ-
racy? This is the role of recreation.

This is a challenging opportunity
and one that calls for close scrutiny of
not only what we do but how we do it.
Actually, on the shoulders of the rec-
reation leaders of America could rest
part of the responsibility as to whether
this nation stays free in the generations
ahead. This is quite a trust, but if lei-
sure time is not profitably used, the
trend back to artificiality and the de-
terioration of community life could re-
sult and, possibly, even global conflict.

Balanced, meaningful and purpose-
ful living should be made so real, so
vital and so virile that this area of liv-
ing we call leisure will take care of it-
self. This could well be the goal of all
who are identified with the recreation
movement. Let’s accept the challenge.

Recreation Editorial

Sirs:

Having just seen Paul Moore’s very
fine editorial in the April issue of REC-
REATION, we feel he would be a wonder-
ful person to represent the field of re-
ligion in a series of editorials, written
by outstanding men in the fields of ed-
ucation, medicine, and religion, and
stressing the importance Of hcalthy
sports participation. We would be hon-
ored if he would consent to write an
editorial for us, giving his views as to
the importance Of sports as it relates to
the spiritual development of man.

We plan tO send this series Of edi-
torials in one package to 1,800 daily
papers, this spring, suggesting that
they be printed on the editorial pages,
under the by-lines of the authors, and
prefaced with a brief paragraph about
the author. If he does not have the
time to write another editorial for us,
we would appreciate having your per-
~ mission to use the one that appeared
in RECREATION.

tival of American Sports, Chicago,

Recruitment of Students

Sirs:

After reading Dr. Tait’s and Profes-
sor Brightbill’s thoughts on recruit-
ment Of students for recreation, in the
“Letters” section of your May, 1953
issue, I could not help but think that
they both had good arguments, with the
answer lying ( as Professor Brightbill
pointed out) somewhere in between.

I believe that the most important fac-
tor in leadership selection depends to
a large extent upon the potential inter-
est an individual may have in recrea—
tion and its various ramifications. I be-
lieve interest is paramount because
with it the desire to succeed is there.
However, when we consider “poten-
tial” interest, another important factor
to consider is aptitude.

Admittedly, there may not be, as yet,
any psychological measurement device
for this specific field, but there are
many vocational aptitude tests on the
market today to measure an individu-
al’s potential interest and aptitude in
closely allied fields of social service.
These are not infallible, but more and
more colleges and universities are us-
ing these testing devices today because
such devices have proven reliable in a
majority of cases.

I also believe that such objective
measurement of an individual’s abili-
ties gives him a firmer foundation from
which to set a course. I don’t believe
that most peOple entering college today
are too immature to benefit from such
a testing program; the immaturity

arises when they don’t take cognizance
Of the results.

I agree that we should urge as many
as possible to enter the recreation field
—but not at the expense of disillusion-
ing them within a year or two, when
they find they are unsuited for such a
vocation. Use of objective measure-
ments in the beginning can assure at
least better than average results for
both the potential recreationist and the
recreation field.

Finally, it seems to me that, like all
recreation work, this is also a “team”
project. It is a problem that confronts
all fields and should be considered in
that light. The instructor in business
administration is just as interested in
obtaining potentially good candidates
as we are in recreation. Psychology de-
partments in most colleges and univer-
sities can be of great service in this
field, and in many cases they are. Sub-
j ective udgment is a poor substitution
for selection at best. Objective testing
takes it out Of the realm Of Opinion and
places it on a more democratic plane.
It is from here that the candidate
should make his choice and the instruc-
tor his selection.

Editorially Speaking

 

RECREATION Magazine

Organization

Beginning NOW, in this issue of
RECREATION, we present a new experi-
ment involving the articles in the mag-
azine’s three major departments—
GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, PROGRAM
-——which heretofore have been scattered
throughout the book. These articles
will now he gathered together into sep-
arate sections of their own. We feel
that our past treatment of the three de-
partments has made the material in
each hard to locate and that the new
arrangement will make them more “vis-
able” and more accessible for ready
reference. It is our plan to strengthen
and build up each one of these sections
as much as possible, and in order to do
this we need your assistance.

Please look through this issue care-
fully with this in mind, and let us have
your comments. Be sure to give some
thought to what material, specifically,
you might be able to send us as a con-
tribution to any one of them—in addi-
tion to suggestions.

Because an overlapping of these sub-
jects exists—for program is a part of
administration, and administration is
a part of program, and “general” ar-
ticles often cover both—it is to be
hoped that the administrator will not
skip reading the program section, and
vice-versa. This, of course, is the dan-
ger involved in the use of labels and is
our chief concern regarding the suc-

cess of the new plan. What do you
think?

Something New Has Been Added

A new section is introduced on page
233, which we are calling “Idea of the
Month.” In it we’ll try to give you,
monthly, a workable suggestion as full
of details as possible. We’ll also try to
show how each idea can be adapted for

200

use in your community. Look for it
in every issue!

You’ll want to keep a record of these
ideas for future use. Instead of cut-
ting up the magazine, why not set up a
simple card file, giving the title of the
article and the issue it’s in? And please
send us ideas! Let’s work together.

Administrators

0n the eve of his retirement in 1952,
Willard E. Givens, the executive secre-
tary of the National Education Associa-
tion, stated, “I’ve always thought there
are two basic things that a superinten-
dent had to keep in his own hands, and
those two he certainly has to be pre-
pared to do.

“The two basic things are (1) to
direct personally the public relations
program, and (2) to supervise person-
ally the selection of personnel. The
hardest task the superintendent has to
face, from the standpoint of day-to-day
work, is to make his decisions on a pro-
fessional rather than on a personal ba-
sis. I’ve seen many a man within a
school system promoted or demoted on
account of the personal relationships
between the superintendent and the in-
dividual. That, in school administra-
tion, is just as wrong as it can be. A
man who isn’t big enough to make all
of his decisions as superintendent on
professional grounds ought not to be
superintendent.

“The only way to carry on a public
relations program is to let the people

High Cost of Football

Upon the announcement, last spring
that New York University has adder
itself to the list of colleges that havl
dr0pped football as an intercollegiatu
sport, the New York Herald Tribun

commented editorially as follows

. “N.Y.U. reflects the problems besettin;

collegiate athletic programs in general
The old excuse for subsidized footbal
was that it provided income which sul
ported non-remunerative collegiate ath
letics, such as ‘minor’ sports and intra
murals. This no longer seems to be th
case, at least not invariably. Chancel
lor Henry T. Heald, in his frank rep01
on N.Y.U., says: ‘Students, alumni an
the general public have demonstrate
that they will only support a winnin
football team. Winning a few games i
not enough. The team must rate 112
tionally to get local support.’ Thus i
illustrated the continuing transformz
tion of football from an expression c
school spirit and competitiveness to
commercial enterprise. One is not net
essarily exclusive of the other, c
coprse, but the fact is that the commel
cial aspects of intercollegiate athletic
have, in recent years, dominated a
others. Now they have reached such
stage that teams which cannot mak
good commercially find it impossibl
to play at all.”

PHILADELPHIA, one of the nation’s oldest cities, has long

been known for its homes, its “brotherly love,” its in-
terest in family living, and its unusually rich cultural re-
sources. Quiet acceptance, however, of historic surround-
ings, great universities, world-famous museums and or-
chestras, and established religious traditions was lulling
this giant community to Sleep in the midst of its memorials
to independence.

A city that had always been great was allowing the past
to encroach upon the present and eclipse the future. A
once proud spirit was being overtaken with lethargy, and
contentment passed for civic pride. But the giant was not,
as some thought, altogether asleep. He was stirring and
making plans.

On April 17, 1951, the citizens of the third largest mu-
nicipality in the nation adopted, by referendum, a new
Home Rule Charter and the giant city of Philadelphia was
fully awake once more. On January‘7, 1952, a new admin-
istration took office, the long-fought-for charter was put
into effect, and a new chapter in the Philadelphia story
was begun.

Among the sweeping changes that this civic reform
movement brought with it was the creation of an autono-
mous department of recreation. Formerly just a bureau
in the welfare department, the new department was to be
headed by a commissioner and a deputy commissioner

and superintendent, and its functions were defined, in part,
as follows:

To formulate a comprehensive and coordinated
program of cultural and physicalrecreational activi-
ties to be instituted and conducted in all city recre-
ational facilities, including those managed and op-
erated by the Fairmount Park Commission.

The Department of Recreation shall also, the charter
read, manage and operate the city’s recreational facilities,

“and itself, or by contract, construct, maintain, improve
and repair such facilities.”

reation to all of the people of Philadelphiz

RECREATIOl‘

 

Fredric R. Man

I

Recreation had come of age in Philadelphia, and May
Joseph S. Clark, J r. conferred upon me the honor of beil
appointed the first commissioner of recreation the city h
ever had. To help me in the enormous task of introduci1
this new concept of recreation to Philadelphia, I ask:
Robert Crawford to come from Oakland, California
be deputy commissioner and superintendent of our more
tion department. To our great good fortune, he accepts

Although there had been some form of municipal rec}
ation in Philadelphia since 1912, there had never be
such a clearly defined expression of the people’s desire f
a total community recreation program centered under 0
management. The charter brought together under t
aegis of the Department of Recreation—in addition
playgrounds, recreation centers, and pools—such divel
elements as the municipal stadium, “all parks and squal
not managed and operated by the Fairmount Park Co
mission,” the boards of trustees of the American Fl
House and Betsy Ross Memorial, of the Atwater Kent M
seum, and of Camp Happy, the Recreation Coordinati
Board, and the Fairmount Park Commission itself.

RECREATI!

Our first job, obviously, was to survey this broad ad-
aixture that was our inheritance from Philadelphia’s ear-
ier ages in recreation administration. Upon assuming the
losition of recreation commissioner, I stated that we
hould have an appraisal made of the program and facili-

s under the jurisdiction of the Department of Recrea-
Em, and of the relationships between the public agencies
lat have responsibility for recreation. I felt that this
hould be done by a disinterested organization and one
rhich was thoroughly competent to perform this task. The
ogical choice was the National Recreation Association.

An advisory committee with George D. Butler as chair-
nan, and a field staff directed by H. C. Hutchins, under-
ook this enormous job for the National Recreation Asso-
'iation. Within, approximately, a three-month period, they
nade “A Study of the Public Recreation Properties, Pro-
;rams, and Inter-Agency Relationships in Philadelphia”—
. city of over two million pe0ple covering 133.6 square
niles. Their outstanding report, dated November 1, 1952,
s unquestionably the finest and most thorough study ever
nade of recreation in Philadelphia.

In his foreword to the published report, Joseph Prender-
;ast, exccutive director of the National Recreation Associ-
tion, pointed out that “numerous distinctively good rec-
eation services are being rendered with important recrea-
ional overtones which probably few citizens realize exist
[1 their ‘City of Brotherly Love.’ On the other hand, the
ity’s rccreation facilities and programs are strikingly de-
icient in many respects.”

Among these striking deficiencies, the study, in its sec-
ion on public recreation properties, the area that most
nnnediately concerns us, reports these findings:

“Philadelphia .is woefully lacking in neighborhood play-
;round space . . . neighborhood parks represent less than
L fourth of the amount considered necessary . . . facili-
ies for indoor recreation in city ownership are seriously
leficient in number . . . serious defects are present in
many recreation buildings . . . swimming places within
he city are with few exceptions substandard.” One state-
nent I should like to quote in its entirety: “Not one of the
:bserved recreation sites developed since 1946 could be
Iesignated as a well-planned area. Evidences of poor .con-
truction are apparent even to the casual observer.”

According to Mrs. Sara S. McNeil, director of the wel-
are department before the advent of the charter and the
:ew administration, recreation was at a low ebb in Phila-
lelphia at the end of World War II. An aroused citizenry,
ircd of this neglect, “began bombarding the Department
If Public Welfare, the city councilmen, and others, with
etters, petitions and group visits.”

The result was that between December 20, 1945 and
September 14, 1951, a total of $18,150,000 was allocated

Inder a special loan fund to a capital budget program for

SEPTEMBER. 1953

recreation facilities. Most of this money was spcnt on
playgrounds.

These playgrounds had not escaped the notice of Mr.
Crawford and myself in our initial tour of the properties
belonging to the recreation department. Though our first
interest, at that time, was in the design and equipment of
the various recreation facilities; evidences of poor con-
struction made it necessary for us to decide upon a more
extensive examination of properties developed from 1946
to 1951.

What we found was not only defective workmanship and
inferior construction but also a lack of planning to the
point where, even if the contractors had complied to per-
fection with the plans and specifications given them, the
facilities would still have been most inadequate. It could
be said, without fear of contradiction, that not one of the
new playgrounds develOped with the money from the 1946-
1951 loan fund could qualify as a well-planned playground
or playfield.

Today we have a new philosophy of recreation for Phila-
delphia, and we have put it into action. Our goal is to
bring recreation to all the people of Philadelphia, through
up-to-date facilities, an enriched and expanded program of
diverse activities, and utilization of the city’s tremendous
cultural endowment. n

At the core of our philosophy is what we believe to be
the essential foundation for any new recreation structure:
a professional staff to provide the quality of leadership that

recognizes individual differences, basic needs and social
goals.

In order to attract and secure competent personnel we
develOped new standards for all professional positions and
made it our business to see that the salaries were com-
mensurate with the responsibilities required. Other attrac-
tions were offered such as the forty-hour, five-day week.
A reclassification and pay plan for the entire city made
our job easier. Nevertheless, recreation personnel for the
first time received salaries comparable .with those of others

engaged in allied fields. We re-wrote all the job specifica-
tions for the entire department, in which the standards
were raised to insure qualified personnel to carry out a
meaningful and purposeful program.

We started an on-the-job training program for our gen—
eral staff, and have followed it with an intensive in-service
training program for recreation leaders. We have estab-
lished a workshop for the production of a Department of
Recreation staff manual to be used by all leaders and su—
pervisors. We inaugurated a monthly staff bulletin to keep
our people aware of what is happening within their de-
partment.

Our reorganization plan called for the operation of rec-
reation centers and playgrounds on a year-round basis for
the first time in the history of Philadelphia. Formerly, the
playgrounds were only operated under recreation leader-
ship during the summer months. The fine spirit and high
morale of our staff is reflected in the enriched programs
we have offered, and in the enthusiastic response of the
people of Philadelphia to a program that includes music,
drama, dancing, and arts and crafts, as well as athletics.

We did not, of course, st0p there. From sponsoring the
Greater Philadelphia Drama Association to leasing the
city’s largest private pool and operating it on a non—segre—
gated basis for the first time, we have participated and/or
cooperated with almost every organized activity in the
city, as part of our program. Games, tournaments, cele-
brations, championships, parties, festivals, leagues, are the
standard fare of our activities. What we do besides would
be too lengthy to explore here, though I would cite music
as an example. In addition to the Christmas carols in the
City Hall courtyard and the annual singing tournament,

we had in Philadelphia in 1952 over one hundred fre
concerts by such diverse groups as the Philadelphia 013
chestra, the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra, the Police and
Firemen’s Band, the Philadelphia Brass Band, the New
Year Mummers string bands, and the American Federal-
tion of Musicians Union Band. These concerts were given
at the centers, the playgrounds and in the park, directly 0]
indirectly through the efforts of the recreation departmen
working with other city departments.

Through the Department of Recreation budget an allo-
cation was made for the Robin Hood Dell concerts. The
Friends of the Dell raise $75,000 and the city make:
available $75,000, for these popular concerts. Over 400,001"
tickets will be distributed through the office of the recreal
tion department for eighteen evening concerts and three
afternoon children’s programs with the oustanding artists
in America on the program. Free concerts are given b}
the Philadelphia Orchestra and a grant was made to un'
derwrite these through the recreation department; and the
tickets are distributed through our offices.

Grants of $25,000 each are made by the city through
our department—to the Museum of Natural Science, the
Museum of Natural History, and the Franklin Institute f0]
the promotion of their cultural programs. The Atwatel
Kent Museum and the Betsy RoSs House are also a part of
the Department of Recreation, which gives us a close tie-up
with the cultural organizations and activities of the com-
munity.

The largest departmental commission of the recreation
department is the F airmount Park Commission, which is
responsible, in the words of the charter, for the “recrea-
tional activities in F airmount Park and other city parks

anaged and operated by the commission . . . in accord-
ICC with the recreational program formulated by the De-
.rtment of Recreation.” In addition to the parks under
e direct supervision of the Fairmount Park Commission,
ere are 131 parks and squares under the immediate su-
rvision of the department itself.

In order to achieve a maximum degree of coordination
all recreational activities conducted by the department,
8 F airmount Park Commission, and the Board of Public
lvucation, a Recreation Coordination Board was created.
is board makes recommendations to the recreation com-

rsioncr on all matters pertaining to joint use of facilities.
A

very close relationship is being worked out with the '

Hilic schools, in which a full use of facilities can be util-
3d. A pilot project will be initiated in the fall in which
3 Board of Education will make available to the De-
lrtmcnt of Recreation a sum of money, which will be
atched by the latter, for the development of a program
rder the supervision of the recreation department for a
lmbcr of school buildings which serve areas of our com-
unity but are not now serviced by the public recreation

partment or private agencies.

 

s- it ‘  ' -. — . .
unp llappy has been relocated on a 544-aere site in the Po-
uno Mountains. Note the camp buildings in the background.

Since many of our facilities are out-dated and out-moded
1d have been poorly designed, we asked the City Council
1d the City Planning Commission for capital funds
hich, when properly spent, would assure Philadelphia of
wing some of the finest recreational facilities in Amer-
a. A six-year capital program for recreational improve-
ents calls for an expenditure of over fifteen million dol-
.rs. This money has already been scheduled. In addi-
on, we envision that several million more will be needed
I'r improvements for facilities under the F airmount Park
ommission. Over three and a half million dollars for
ew improvements will be spent during this year.

From the drawing boards of our planning and construc-
on seetion and from budget and finance conferences and
erhaps, above all, from the willingness of the-City Coun-

EPTEMBER 1953

cil and civic-conscious citizcns supporting us, we have
evolved a program of recreational facilities in Philadelphia
which, when completed, should be second to none.

Although many of the projects will be under construc-
tion, none will be completed-before the National Recrea-
tion Congress meets in Philadelphia the first week in Oc-
tober. However, we will have models and drawings which
should be of interest to those delegates who are in the
midst of planning a construction program. We are doing
everything in our power to see that the new facilities are
functional and are so designed to serve not only a wide
variety of interests but also to serve all age groups of our
population.

Our work with the public schools, housing projects and
Crime Prevention Association, our pilot projects at the
Youth Center (formerly the house of detention) and Riv-
erview (formerly the home for the indigent), our purchase
of a 544-acre site in the Pocono Mountains, relocating the
city’s old Camp Happy—these things would, in themselves,
require a chapter to relate. And they are only some of the
broad-scale interrelationships we have established in as-
suming our proper part of the city’s reSponsibility for the
health, welfare and recreation of its people, and in making
successful human relations an essential ingredient of all
our programs.

Bigler right now, with its separate areas for tots, teen-
agers, adults and senior citizens, with its variety of games
and equipment, its functional contrasts in surface and ma-
terial, will be the first of its kind in this area, where a
Spray-pool is an innovation, and creative play-sculpture is
almost daring. And this is but one example of what we
will do everywhere we can, each time fitting the solution
of the problem to the nature of the particular area.

We have established no standard operating procedure,
we have adopted no pet formula. We are armed only with
our desire to be forward-looking, and our willingness to
test new ideas. We are not satisfied with shinier versions
of five-year-old equipment, and we do not feel bounded by
the dictates of tradition. We are human, and we will make
errors, but we will remain open-minded—faithful to those
principles of recreation in which we sincerely believe, and
responsible to the people of Philadelphia who have placed
faith in us.

Recreation has, we believe, come of age in Philadelphia.
The story is being written in reality as I write this on
paper. I have been able to give only an imperfect state-
ment of our aims, our plans, our accomplishments, such as
they are. It is my hope that many of you will come to the
National Recreation Congress in Philadelphia this year to
see and feel for yourselves that spirit and purpose which
pervade the whole movement of recreation here, and
which, try as I may, I can only inadequately convey.

“The so-ealled ‘emergeney’ is fast becoming for

Americans the normal way of life. . . . Let’s stop be-
ing defensive about defense.”—Dr. Leonard Mayo

35th NATIONAL
RECREATHJN

 

Dr. Ralph Sockman

 

Saeaéew

O Pennsylvania’s Governor John 5. Fine, Mayor Joseph Clark of Philadelphia.
and Dr. Ralph W. Sockman will address the 35th National Recreation Congress
at Philadelphia, September 28 to October 2. Other speakers at the Congress gen-
eral sessions will include: Lieutenant General Laurence S. Kuter of the Air Force.
Mrs. Howard Braucher, Dr. Luther Gulick, Hugh Pomeroy, Dr. Paul Douglass and
Joseph Prendergast. Delegates to the Congress are assured a lifting of their sights
through the messages of these outstanding speakers.

The address by Mayor Clark will open the Congress. The swift action of his
new city administration in the field of recreation is well known to recreatior
leaders throughout the country. Not so well known are other changes which this
reform administration has effected. The Congress welcomes this opportunity tc
hear from Philadelphia’s brilliant and effective mayor and to commend him f0]
the advances which have already been made in his city.

Dr. Sockman of Christ Church, New York City, one of the world’s great minis
ters, has consented to give the banquet address. Dr. Sockman’s voice is know:
throughout the country because of his radio work; and now Congress delegates
will have a chance to receive from him personally the deeply inspiring messagt

 

which he has the power to give.

General Kuter, commander of the Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base
Alabama, will hring to the Congress a reminder of the importance of recreatior
for the men in all kinds of uniforms.

Mrs. Braucher, widow of Howard Braucher, philosopher and administrate]
of the National Recreation Association for more than forty years, has a rea
message for the Congress as a result of her many years of very close associatior
with the movement. She continues to take an active part in the recreation fielt
as a volunteer worker on the staff of NRA.

Dr. Luther Gulick, Dr. Douglass and Joseph Prendergast will speak at th:
Tuesday morning general session. Dr. Gulick and Dr. Douglass, chairmen o
committees advisory to the association in the fields of research and personnel
will tell of the plans and the work accomplished in these fields; and Mr. Prender
gast will make a report to the Congress on the work of the National RecreatiOI
Association in the past year, and the plans for the immediate future.

There has been great interest in planning for recreation, and Wednesda]
morning’s general session ,will feature this subject, with a panel headed by Hugl
Pomeroy, director of the Westchester County Planning Commission, New York
The panel will consider such questions as the importance of recreation as a1
essential part of the city_plan, and the importance of relating plans for recreatior
areas to the total plans for the city. This should prove a very valuable and inter

206 L111: RECREATIOI

At the Monday afternoon meeting on recreation in hospitals. Dr. George G.
Deaver of NYU-Bellevue Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, whose
reputation in the field of rehabilitation is widely known, will speak on “The Role
of Recreation in Rehabilitation.” Another feature of the hospital meetings will
be a demonstration of the value of recreation to chronic hospital patients by a
group of patients being brought to the Congress from Goldwater Memorial Hospi-
tal in New York City, under the general direction of Mrs. Beatrice Hill, consultant
for Recreation Rehabilitation Services in that hospital and in Bellevue. Mrs. .Hill
is author of Starting a Recreation Program in a Civilian HOSpital.

Otto T. Mallery, a lifelong Philadelphian, who has been a member of the
board of directors of the National Recreation Association since 1912 and is now
chairman of the board, will convene the Congress on Monday night.

The Reverend Paul Moore, Jr., of the association, will give the invocation.
Other board members scheduled to preside at various sessions include: Frederick
Warburg, Grant Titsworth, Susan Lee, Frank Adams, William Davis and Rachel
Gallagher. This year’s toastmaster will be Gaylord Donnelley, president R. R.
Donnelley and Sons Company of Chicago.

Among the arrangements for entertainment, the usual tea will be given by the
association, to welcome guests to the big meeting. As a part of the Congress
program, a performance will be given by the Temple University Concert Choir
under the direction of Mrs. Elaine Brown. As Philadelphia is famous for string
bands, arrangements are also being made for one of the best in the city to play
for the Congress. A demonstration of rope skipping will be given by the Rope
Skippers, a group of teen-age girls from Bristol, New Hampshire.

Philadelphia, with its wealth of historical and cultural treasures, is an intrigu-
ing city, and delegates will be given an opportunity to see the sights. The local
arrangements committee is providing two well-planned tours: Tour #l—General
Tour with emphasis upon historical sites; Tour #2—Recreation Tour with
emphasis upon recreation areas and facilities. Twenty-minute stops will be made
at special spoints of interest. The general tour will be $1.65 and the recreation
tour $1.25. Both are scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, September 30th. Dele-
gates, upon arrival, should study details of the two tours and purchase tickets

before Tuesday night, September 29th.

Among other Special Interest Tours will be one on hospital recreation and
one for those delegates who would like to observe recreation for older persons.

Other special features are still being arranged as RECREATION goes to press,
and everything points to a very full and a very successful program throughout

Congress week. ( Continued on Page 208)

National Recreation Congress each year. Their presence at
the Congress is welcomed by executives, board members,
and others with responsibility for keeping up to date on
new developments in equipment, supplies and services.

At Philadelphia, the exhibit area will be set up in the
Clover Room and in the Red Room of the Bellevue-Strat-
ford, on Ballroom Floor.

Exhibits will be officially opened at 9:30 A.M. on M011-
day, September 28. They will be open daily until 6:00 P.M.
except on Monday night when they will remain open until
nine. Names of representatives of exhibitors will be listed
in the Congress Program, and a special pamphlet concern-
ing the products and services on display will be distributed
at the registration desk.

The list of exhibiting firms, as of the deadline for this
issue of RECREATION, is shown at the right.

Adjacent to the exhibit area will be the consultation
center, staffed by specialists from NBA, and the registra-
tion desk.

There will be space this year for educational exhibits
on the eighteenth floor of the Bellevue-Stratford. A display

Words and music by Phoebe K. Higgins

In Seattle, one of our greatest pleasures was meeting Mrs. C. W. Higgins of
Reno, Nevada. We roped her into helping us with our amateur talent show—and
discovered that she could write songs and poems at the drop of a hat! Of course,
we begged for samples. Here’s a fun song, made for action, and guaranteed to
break the ice at any meeting or get-together. Try it with gestures, whenever you’re
trying to get a group to laugh and relax. (Congress groups—attention!) We think
you’ll like it.

This is, of course, a dialogue song, sung by two peOple as
a stunt song, or by a group, in which each person turns to
his neighbor, or half the group “talks” to the other half.
It should be accompanied by broad gestures and panto-
mime—~low bows, arm and hand gestures, changes in facial

Two EVENTS occurred at the begin-
ning of our century which, taken to-
gether, explain much that has happened
during the lives of all of us. In 1905,
Albert Einstein stated his famous for-
mula that E = mc”. Through it he laid
the foundation for the atomic age. The
following year, in 1906, the organiza-
tion of the National Recreation Associ-
ation bore witness to the fact that sci-
ence wedded to industry had so multi-
plied the powcr of man that he had time
to play as well as work. Human beings
began to eXperience something per-
manently new in history—the oppor-
tunity to enjoy free time without com-
pulsion. Thus, at the threshold of the
20th century, the twin phenomena of
(1) available power and (2) available
leisure stood side by side.
Released from drudgery by techno-

logical advance, people soon found
themselves to be the owners of two

precious and very personal possessions.

DR. PAUL F. DOUGLASS is the chairman
of the NRA National Advisory Com-

mittee on Recruitment, Training and
Placement of Recreation Personnel.

The first was money to spend in full
freedom as they chose, over and above
the demands for mere physical exist-
ence. The second was time to enjoy as
they chose, outside the routine by
which they earned their livings. Men
who knew more about the past than
they could imagine about the future,
predicted in these early days of this cen-
tury that free time and spending money
would erode human character when
men were released from the age-long
disciplines of poverty and wearisome
toil. The vision of the National Recrea-
tion Association, however, saw in avail-
able leisure the Opportunity folr man to
experience inner growth and to enjoy
this world in which God has placed us.
When Thomas E. Rivers, assistant ex-
ecutive director of the National Recrea-
tion Association, recently met His Holi-
ness Pope Pius XII in audience, Rivers
observed that, next to religion, the
wholesome use of leisure stands as an
important avenue to abundant life. One
of the testimonies to this fact is the ex-
istence on the grounds of Vatican City
of a playing field built over a quarter

of a century ago by gifts from the

Knights of Columbus of St. Louis. A

young priest from Whitman, Massa-
chusetts, by the name of Francis Jo-
seph Spellman, served as the first coach
and recreation director of that facility.

In the near half-century since the
National Recreation Association was
founded, America has witnessed two
apparently contradictory trends; both
are the products of modern technology.
Howard Mumford Jones describes one
of these by saying that our century has
been one of increasing horror. It has
been the most savage period in human
history. Recreation people see the same
period to have been one of increasing
opportunity for pleasure. As never be-
fore, man has had freedom to enjoy
himself although he has been constant-
ly haunted by premonitions of his
doom. Liking statistics, I find the pro-
portion of this pleasure eXpressed in
the statement that in this year of 1953
the amount of money spent by Ameri-
cans for recreation of various kinds
will exceed the entire national income
of the United States twenty years ago.
In 1932 our national income was just

under $40,000,000,000. This year rec-

RECREATION

reational travel alone will rise to al-
most half that sum. It has become the
third largest industry in the nation, ex-
lceeded in size only by agriculture and
manufacturing.

If time permitted, I should like to

talk about the vast recreational activity
of the American people, tell about the
millions of sports fishermen, hunters,
bowlers, golfers, skiers, private row-
rfjoat, motor boat, sail boat, and yacht
'wners. I should like to tell you how
public recreation facilities provide
isleasure for millions of people annu-
ally on bathing beaches, on baseball
diamonds and soft ball fields, in out-
door and indoor swimming pools; for
linen, women, and children attending
lzoos, going to band concerts in public
parks, playing golf on public courses,
enjoying picnic areas; and millions
taking advantage of arboretums, ar-
chery ranges, boating centers, bowling
greens, bridle trails, camps, conserva-
tories, gardens, handball and horseshoc
courts, museums, nature trails and cen-
ters, skating rinks, tennis courts, and
many other kinds of facilities. I should
like to speak of Americans engaged in
music and drama, in arts and crafts, in
square dancing, and in a hundred-and-
one activities which encourage people
to enjoy time. In all of these pursuits
the inward person eXpands to encom-
pass the fullness of creation and re-
Ializes that “the earth is full of the good-
ness of the Lord.”
‘ Have you ever stopped in your busy
lives to think about time? To possess
rtime we must plan for it and we must
use it. Otherwise it escapes us; it has
ilno meaning and no purpose. It is what
you and I do in time that makes it
chunt. Organized recreation seeks to
Igive meaning to leisure time.

You can see that recreation has be-
leome an intimate part of the lives of
lAmericans of all ages. The provision
for leisure time activities has become
'a huge operation requiring vast facili-
fties which must be administered effi-
[ciently by trained professional people.

wholesome and genuinely “re-creat-
ing” activity.

Recreation as a Career

I hope that some of you may choose
recreation as the field to which you
pr0pose to devote your life energies.
For others, I hope that a “look” inside
the profession will awaken you to a
deeper appreciation of what recreation
means. Perhaps you may want to vol-
unteer as public-spirited assistants to
share your skills and abilities with
others in off-hour periods. As citizens,
all of us have the obligation to see that
recreation is adequate, honestly admin-
istered, and sincerely enjoyed.

When a young man or woman is in
the process of choosing a career, he or
she asks a series of questions something

like this: (I) What is this and how
much does it pay? (2) Where do I find
out about the profession? (3) What
should I study to prepare for it? (4)
Where should I study? (5) How do I
get a job?

What is the profession and what does
it pay? Recreation as a profession pro-
vides a trained and sympathetic leader-
ship to guide and serve the leisure time
interests of all pe0ple. It seeks to en-
large their interests, perfect their skills,
and to encourage the satisfaction which
comes from the feeling of doing a thing
a person wants to do well. It furnishes
opportunities for self-eXpression and
personal growth that increase the joy

was $3741 with the range from $3000
to $5000. The National Recreation As-
sociation has long been a leader in
bringing about a standard position
classification and salaries apprOpriate
to the classification.

Where do I had out about the pro-
fession? You find out about the pro-
fession by writing to the National Rec-
reation Association, 315 Fourth Ave-
nuc, New York. You will find upon
reading the literature that recreation
leadership offers a wide choice of types
of service. You may wish to enter pub-
lic recreation conducted by cities,
counties, states, and the federal gov-
ernment. Or you may prefer a civilian
position‘with the armed forces. Again,
you may find your field of usefulness
in hospitals, or in industry, or in vari-
ous kinds of institutions. You may pre-
fer work with voluntary youth-serving

agencies such as the YMCA, the
YWCA, the CYO, boys’ cluhs, Boy and

Girl Scouts, teen-age centers, 4-H clubs,
and churches. Recreation offers a
broad field for your choice according
to your own interest and inclination.
What should I study to prepare for
it? Willard C. Sutherland, who heads
the recreation personnel service of
the National Recreation Association,
thinks an undergraduate should pursue
a course consistent with the objectives
of general education during the first
two years in college and specialize in
recreation courses in subsequent years

scntcd to Second Student Conference on Inter-American
Culture and Education, Rutgers University, April 1953.

of living. Like most professions where
people work unselfisth with people,
recreation pays no salaries which make
people rich, although much personal
inner satisfaction may result. The me-
dian salary of superintendents of recre-
ation in 143 American cities stands at
$5,120 with the range from $2900 to
$11,000. The average salary of super-
visors of special activities such as mu-
sic and drama is about 34900. In 1951
the median salary for persons entering
the profession with master’s degrees

 

to the extent of about ’forty per cent of
the total credits required for the bach-
elor’s degree. In his general education
foundations the student should seek to
understand the structure, nature, and
social relationships of man. He should
know about the world he lives in and
the nature of man’s environment.
Courses in biology, physiology, geol-
ogy, botany, and astronomy have spe-
cial value to recreation workers. The
student should also reach into the his-

tory and skills of the cultural arts, be-

211

ing familiar with literature, drama,
music_, art, dancing, crafts, writings
Because
much of the work of a recreation per-
son depends upon knowledge of educa-
tional methods, he should know the the-
cry and practice of education and how
to deal with pe0ple as individuals and
in groups. Graduate courses should be
planned carefully in terms of person-
al occupational goals.

Where should I study? Some fifty-

four colleges and universities, conven-

and participation activities.

iently distributed in geographic areas,
offer undergraduate major curriculums
In 1952, 392 students
took their baccalaureate degrees with a
major in recreation. At the present
time there are about 1600 undergradu-
ate students majoring in recreation.
On the graduate level about twenty in-
stitutions offer work leading to the
master’s degree and five to the doctor’s
In 1952, 173 students took
graduate degrees in recreation, New
York Univcrsity and Indiana Univer-
sity leading in the number conferrerl.
The graduate student body in recrea—
tion numbers about 400. The National
Recreation Association issues a bulle-
tin describing various kinds of student
assistance available at specific institu-
tions on both the graduate and the un-
dergraduate level. In general, assist-
ance falls into these classifications: (1)
a fellowship paying a cash stipend, (2)

in recreation.

a graduate assistantship with appren-
tice' duties performed in return for tu-
ition and sometimes a small stipend,
(3) a teaching fellowship paying a sti-
pend in return for which the student
does limited teaching, (4) internships
providing practical on-the-job experi-
ence in certain institutions while the
student carries work at an academic in-
stitution, and (5) general scholarships
paying part or all of tuition fees.

How do I get a job? This is a down-
to-earth question which every young
person faces. The alert student keeps
his eyes Open. He talks to successful
operators in the profession. When he
meets with recruiting officers, he finds
that they give'special attention to his
academic training, to his work experi-
ence, to his personal qualifications, to
impressions gained in a personal inter-
view, and increasingly to performance
on written examinations. But here
again the National Recreation Associ-
ation is ready to help. It maintains a
personnel service where qualified work-
ers may register for employment.
Through this service many recreation
agencies secure outstanding personnel.
Best of all, the Association takes a con-
tinuing interest in the professional ad-
vancement of recreation workers. It is
this kind of close teamwork in the in-
terest of recreation that builds morale
and wins the respect of the public for

the recreation profession.

How Can I Serve as a Citizen?

Many people have a deep interest in.
recreation, but do not wish to take it
up as a career or profession. Often
people ask how they can serve in this
field as citizens. The citizen interested
in recreation can play a very important
role. Recreation needs citizens on pri-
vate and public boards. In one New
Jersey city the wife of a dean of a col-
lege exercises her citizen rights to lead
a recreation board. In a Florida city a
young woman, with a master’s degree
in recreation, married a lawyer and he-
came a citizen interested in doing he.
part for recreation as a highly intelli-
gent and useful member of a board.
Recreation needs citizens who under-
stand its goals and who are willing to
support it with their time, talents, en-
ergies, and money.

Recreation has come of age; and it
has become an international movement.
When I stop to think of the fact, I
wonder if perhaps the common denom-
inator of our global confusion is not the
yearning of people to find free time and
to enjoy it-——-witllout anxieties.

Of this one thing I am convinced:
recreation takes the combined efforts
of dedicated people. Whether you en-
gage in recreation professionally or
whether you merely enjoy recreation in
your leisure, I h0pe that you‘will un-
derstand its significance in this grow-
ingly united world of ours.

'7HERE HAVE BEEN many informative

articles printed of late in the pop-
plar publications about the mentally
handicapped child. The Ladies Home
Journal published one of the first in
21950, written by Pearl Buck, entitled
“The Child Who Never Crew.” Par-
ent’s Magazine in 1951 printed “New
Hope For The Different Child” by Eu-
gene Graham. In August of 1952 To-
day’s Health, published by the Ameri-
can Medical Association, ran an article,
“Planning For The Feebleminded” by
Kenneth Robb. In October of this past
year the Saturday Evening Post pre-
sented the article, “Retarded Children

“Our Neediest Children” written by
Albert Deutseh appeared in the Wo-

children written about in these articles

fever. In most cases of mental retarda-
tion, it has been found that the brain
has been defective in deve10ping in the
embryonic stage. Many of these chil-
dren are physically as well as mentally
crippled because the brain area that
controls 'bodily movement and speech
has also been injured. Others may have
severe brain damage but ,no outward
physical defects that are evident to the

medical treatment cannot restore the
damaged brain cells; training can,
however, help these children to func-

This is the prime objective of the
training program that is now being car-
ried on in state schools and homes for
the mentally handicapped child. Where
some years ago the mentally deficient
were given custodial care, now our
state institutions’ program objective is
to treat, teach and train these patients.
We aim, through our program of thera-

abilities can be fully developed, to
teach them so their behavior is socially
accepted, to counsel and direct them so

they can grow through experiences.”

Helen Hugo

In the state institution the recreation
program offers the following activities:
athletics, folk dance classes, weekly
dances, clloral groups, community
singing, drama, creative crafts, hobby
clubs, game room sessions, and a stu-
dent council which affords training in
democratic living through the students’
own organization and publication.
When the boys or girls return to their
communities they will need to be ac-
cepted and have an opportunity to take
part in the community recreational
activities.

The community recreation leader
can be the important“ link between the
institution and the community. To
further mutual understanding we use
every opportunity to bring the commu-
nity into the institution and take the in-
stitution into the community. We we]-
come organizations bringing entertain-
ment to our students and we, in turn,
take our boys and girls into the com-
munity to take part in athletic events
and local fairs and special parades.

If the community playground direc-
tor is to be the important link between
the institution and the outside, he must
understand some of the basic needs of
mentally defective children. They have
a need to belong, to be accepted by
family and community; they need aid
in building self confidence; they need
to be encouraged and reassured; they
need recognition and the opportunity
to gain status in both work and play.
The recreation leader should under-
stand that the mentally handicapped
should not be required to compete on
the individual bases in most activities.
Team competition, however, is not too
threatening because it is overshadowed
by the group acceptance of each mem-
ber. Separate activities are not needed

for the mentally handicapped child, as
213

he improves by having the Opportunity
to play freely with the normal child
who, we note, fully accepts him. It is a
fact that the mentally handicapped
child is easily discouraged and requires
constant praise and reassurance. In
order to work successfully with him the
leader must understand that the group
must be kept small, so that individual
attention can be given and instructions
for the participants can be patiently re-
peated. The leader must accept the
mentally handicapped person on the
level at which he is then found to be
functioning, and this requires observa-
tion. For example, in a folk dance class
a therapist noticed that many of the

boys and girls were confused about
which were their right hands and feet
so she quickly had all the couples tie
red ribbon on their right wrists—which
simplified the following of directions.
It is not uncommon to find a mentally
handicapped boy who has low intellec-
tual ability and is unable to count but
has shown he could reproduce a per-
fect miniature of a nearby community
church. So it is that the mentally han-
dicapped child has capabilities as well
as limitations and the recreation leader
can help the community realize this.

We, in the institutions, have seen
boys and girls return to us, not because
they failed on the job assignment, but

Camping with the Mentally Retarded

0 The sidewalk in front of a building
in San Francisco was strewn with bed
rolls and an assortment of luggage. It
was a bright June morning in 1952,
and a group of fifty-four excited young-
sters waited for the buses that were to
take them to a camp. This might have
been any group of children going to
any camp, but it was not. . . .

In December, 1950, a group of par-
ents and friends of mentally retarded
children had formed an organization to
help the mentally retarded child to be-
come an accepted part of community
life. Their aims were to provide a facil-
ity for the post-school group of retard-
e'd children, to add to the public school
program for the school-age children,
and to establish a pre-school program
where the young child could begin his
early training and parents could partic-
ipate in an educational program.

In June of 1951, Aid Retarded Chil-
dren, Incorporated, held its first sum-
mer camp with sixteen children in at-
tendance. The results of this experi-
ence encouraged the organization to
attempt, in 1952, a similar project on

a much larger scale.

The camp staff consisted of a general
camp chairman, director, registered
nurse, and twelve counselors. Three of
the counselors were teachers of “excep-
tional children” in public school sys-
tems; the others were parents and mem-

bers of Aid Retarded Children.

Counselors’ meetings were held each
evening to discuss and evaluate the
day’s program. These resulted in the
setting up of the following camp ob-
jectives:

1. To give campers an opportunity for broad-
er experience in socialization.

2. To help in the development of self-reliance.
3. To offer healthful outdoor living.

4. To provide broader avenues of social and
living experiences than are available in the
average home.

5. To provide opportunity for recognition
and achievement by the child.

6. To provide opportunity for the parent to
gain objectivity on the whole problem of the
retarded child.

7. To provide opportunity for training experi-
ence for persons planning to work in special
education, mental hygiene or related nelds.

Among the recommendations for

1953:

I. If possible, the camp nurse should be ex-
perienced in working with retarded children
—and ill or disturbed children should be
placed under her care, without parallel care

  
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
   

because the time off the job—their le'
sure hours—was not wisely use
These mentally handicapped perso
did not know where to find friends i
the community, or where to find acti
ties that would welcome them as pa
ticipants. This, then, is a challenge
every community recreation leader-—
effectively work with the local pare
groups, the schools and state instit
tions which are training these mental
handicapped pe0ple. To rehabilita
the mentally retarded child, send hi
back to his family and to the full
life possible, will require the help a
understanding of every communit

leader. I

or suggestions by counselors unless requested
by the nurse.

2. Counselors should be persons with some!
understanding of the retarded child and with
an aptitude for working with groups of chil-
dren and associating cooperatively with other
counselors. In addition to the volunteer par.
ent-counselors, some effort should be made
in the future to secure a larger number of
college-age counselors.

3. There should be a ratio of one counselor
for every four campers and one unassigned
counselor for every seven counselors to assist,
relieve, provide liaison with medical facility,
over-all supervision, and so on, and at least
two counselors in each cabin.

4. The camp director should submit job anal-
yses for counselors and consult with the
group in preparation of a handbook describ-
ing what can be expected of the retarded
child in a camp setting.

5. The chairman and/or committee should
endeavor to enlist the services of group work
consultants in planning the camp program

We saw the most sheltered and the
most retarded members of the groups
begin to show signs of awareness of self
in relation to others—an awareness of
self-importance and a sense of belong-
ing. Many of the children who seemed
quite helpless when the program gol
under way were showing a high degree
of improvement at the end of the camp
ing period. Group dynamics hat
served well in the matter of stimulating
all members of the grOUp to feel a sens¢
of importance and a desire to become
an active part of the group.

It was the motto of the camp the
every camper must have a pleasant ex
perience, one that he should long re
member; and in a real sense the mean
ing of this motto was fulfilled.

I‘m: DECISION by the Fairmount Park

If Philadelphia inexpensive summer

ropularity of a number of summer lhe-
ters within an hour or two driving

ies nearby would make access, by mo-
tor, easy from several quarters of the
city. A bus route was handy. Already
a well-established restaurant was lo-
cated in one of the famous Colonial
houses of the park—Belmont Mansion.
There were fine trees scattered about,
open areas in abundance for parking,
and a little Victorian kiosk for refresh-
ments. Even a row of stables with their
Dutch doors could be converted—with
new cement floors—into dressing
rooms. All these things contributed to
the final great success of this season——
our first.

Everything favorable for such a site
was there, except the theater. The new-
ly developed
was decided upon as the most suitable
type. Actually, instead of round, this

became an oval plan with an oval stage,

“theater-in-the-round”

an oval saucer with terraces for the
rows of seats and an oval tent above.
Mr. Erling Pedersen of Philadelphia
was the architect, and Mr. Arthur E.

W. H. Noble, Jr.

Campfield of New York constructed the
tent—in blue and orange stripes——
which added a great deal to the gaiety
of the whole set-up:

The construction of the tiers was
worked out in white cement blocks for
the risers and cement for the treads,
with the ramps down to the stage in ce-
ment. These were later covered with
rubber mats. The aisle running com-
pletely around behind the last row of
seats was cemented and also covered
with rubber matting, both for safety
and against the noise of late-comers.
Drainage presented quite a problem, as
a flash Hood pouring down the aisles
into this saucer would be inconvenient,
to say the least. However, before the
opening of the season, all grading was
covered with grass and attractive plant-
ing, with walking areas in black-top.

The ticket office, built of cinder
blocks, was painted white with red trim
to match the dressing rooms and the

concession bootb. The roofs were

green asbestos shingles. The converted
stables, with showers, cross ventilation
and individual wash basins, allowed
Space not only for the actors but for the
construction of props and scenery, and
storage of these, and a room for the
“boss canvas man” who must live on
the site to adjust the tent stays in case
of sudden wind, rain, and so on.

, It was found necessary to construct
three small rooms, directly connected
with the tent, to house the complicated
switchboards and lighting system, a
quick change room for the actors, and a
room for pr0ps which could be brought
down the ramps between the acts.
These were painted to match the stripes
of the tent.

The interior was as gay and colorful
as the outside. The stage, a foot above
the aisle around it, was carpeted. The
white metal yachting chairs had seats
and backs of yellow, red, green and
blue canvas. The valance around the
steel frame which contained the over-
head lights was the blue of the tent
stripes. The furniture and other props
were, naturally, very low in order to ob-
struct the view as little as possible; and
flowers and potted plants were used to
add to the color of the scene. Loud-
speakers and equipment were, for the
most part, concealed.

While the theater was being con-
structed, a great deal of thought was go-
ing into the plans for the theatrical pro-
ductions. It seemed sound to the Fair-
mount Park Commissioners that the
prices should be very reasonable, well
under the usual summer box office
prices. The nightly top price was $2.40,
scaling down to $1.20, but the small

size of the tent and the lack of any
apron or orchestra pit brought even the
seats at each end of the tent (14th row)
fairly close to the stage. The total seat-
ing capacity was around 1,000, with
ten rows on the sides, or short axis, and
fourteen rows on the long axis. The
weekly gross receipts were $11,700
with capacity attendance. Matinees did
not come up to expectations, but it was
a long hot summer.

An experienced New York pro-
ducer, Theron Bamberger, was en-
gaged to handle the productions. His
Bucks County Playhouse was well
known to Philadelphians; and his was
the task of assembling staff, actors and
scenery for eleven productions of a
week each. Each play was rehearsed
the week before Opening and a director,
Gerald Savory, was secured. His ex-
perience included two years of direct-

than one play, the repertory system was
not followed. The “leads” were changed
each week, and more stress was put on
all-around good production than on a
famous star poorly supported.

The selection of the plays was made
with great care. Not only must they
adapt themselves to production “in the
round,” both from the actor’s point of
view and that of the setting, but they
must be light and gay and send the au-
dience away with a smile. The moral
values had to be weighed and the lan-
guage scrutinized, for it must be re-
membered that this was a municipal
undcrtaking. Too broad, burlesque or
slapstick comedy was not judged suit-

able or “amusing.” Drawing room

comedies by Coward, Lonsdale, Philip
Barry, Savory and Moss Hart were in-
terspersed with the more hilarious
Three Men On A Horse and Twentieth
Century. G. B. Shaw’s The Devil’s Dis-
ciple contributed satire, and was the
final play of the season.

The eleven performances grossed
$102,664 and played to an estimated
75,000 persons. The investment of the
Park Commission included the major
items of tent, electrical equipment, air-
conditioning, and materials and labor
put into the preparation of the site it-
self. The first season was considered an
real success and it is planned to com-1
mence production a month earlier for
the second season.

EQUIPPING A CRAFT Root!

Tm: CONCORD CRAFT ROOM, of Concord, North Carolina,
is a beautiful example of community cooperation. The
program is good by city standards, and for a town of
I 16,000 its accomplishment is remarkable. Requests have
I come for our assistance in establishing eraft rooms in
i other places. The best help we can give is to tell exactly
: how we started our own successful venture and encourage
each group to develop their program according to local
needs. Every situation is different.
_ When the Concord Tribune printed a notice that on a
l ionday night in January, 1952, recreation director Bill
liidinger would meet with those interested in arts and
eraf ts, a dozen interested, talented people responded. They
were concerned with music, photography, the dance, dra-
matics, painting, ceramics and jewelry design. The grOUp
formed a council and planned committees to perfect each
branch of the program. Music, photography, dancing, and
drama were each develOped separately; and ceramics, jew-
dry and metal work were listed together to be enjoyed in
a proposed craft room. Four members of the group offered
to assume responsibility for setting up an equipped room
for craftsmen to use in pursuing their hobbies.

These four, Mrs. Springs McCoy, Miss Mary Pr0pst,
is. Don Holt and Mr. Wesley Walker, met the next day
if the community center rooms allocated to crafts and ap-
praised the possibilities of the space. Two empty rooms,
one 12 by 20 feet and the other 16 by 18 feet, three tables,
the privilege of borrowing chairs from the assembly hall
downstairs, use of a nearby lavatory with hot and cold
Water, $250 cash from the community budget for crafts,
and a great deal of enthusiasm and determination were
lie assets at hand.

The previous training of these volunteers was of ines-

timable value. Mrs. McCoy had been an art supervisor
and had studied crafts; Miss Pr0pst, a school principal,
had worked in crafts as a hobbyist; Mrs. Holt had studied
arts and crafts extensively and had observed many craft
rooms in Operation; Mr. Walker had his own well equipped
sh0p at home and operated his own kiln. Also, the re-
quests filed in the recreation commission oche for a craft
room in town had brought to light a surprising number of
interested craftsmen. The committee members agreed to
equip the room eventually for ceramics, enameling on
copper, jewelry design, Hat silver work, copper hammering
and etching, rug hooking, and painting in Oils and water
color. More requests for ceramics and rug hooking had
been on record than for other crafts so these two were se-
lected to start.

Mrs. Franklin Shinn, whose hooked rugs have received
wide recognition, moved to the community center a neigh-
borhood rug hooking group which she had been instruct-
ing and opened it to other interested people. These crafts-
men needed only a strip cutter (at $12.95) and tables for
working; so they started activities on March first.

To start from scratch in equipping for other crafts, the
committee referred to the book Where to Get What, com-
piled by Penland School of Handicrafts, Penland, North
Carolina.* Fifteen catalogs most closely related to our
needs were chosen from the Penland lists and assembled
by written requests. Many arrived with “price list on re-
quest” bottlenecks; so we suggest that, to save a week or
more, the price list be ordered with the catalogs.

In planning for an opening date, two or three weeks
should be allowed for catalog study and the making out of
orders. Plan four or five weeks for delivery and the placing
of supplies. Opening day is much easier if everything is
in place and ready to go.

We tried to get all our supplies from as few sources as
possible. Also, ordering from near-by concerns saves time
and money.

After a comparative study of prices, freight rates, and
services offered, we ordered the following—to supply at
least twenty people:

Recently we found buff-color, moist firing clay locally
for three cents a pound in plastic bags. Ordering clay in
plastic bags could eliminate clay containers—except one
for keeping clay for a long time—and small plastic bags
are convenient for keeping individual clay pieces moist
during construction, and are much simpler to handle than a
damp box.

While the above orders were being shipped, the follow-
ing building was done in the rooms: shelves were installed
in closets; a two-level table was built of heavy material to
hold the two kilns. (The high level was for the front-
opening enameling kiln; the low level was for the top load-
ing kiln.) There was a shelf under the high table to be

used for storing kiln furniture.

A table with shelves was built to hold the wedgin

so it could be portable if necessary. The wedging boar

only and the right side for red clay only, one being cov

The wedging board could be eliminated and clay kneadee
on wooden tables as in the Orient, but most potters in thi
hemisphere do their wedging on plaster.

A long table with shelf beneath was built to hold mold
slip and tools. A group of shelves was built for glazes
The two tables already in the room were strengthened wit
angle irons and all the new lumber was stained a dar

$31.15. Other materials bought locally were: oilcloth for
the table tops, $2.44; exhaust fan installed above the kilns,
$30.51; galvanized cans (seven-gallon size)-——one for
whitc clay, one for red clay, and one for plaster—two
enamel wash pans for mixing plaster and catching glaze
when pouring; two enamel buckets; one strainer; two
large spoons; one screw driver; one pair of pliers; one
grind stone; and one set of kitchen scales.

Materials loaned or donated by interested citizens:
molds and pieces for demonstration; a motor for bufiing
and grinding; laboratory equipment which had belonged
to a local physician; two spacious sets of shelves; kitchen
scales and jars; and modeling tools made of popsickle
sticks.

When the room was ready for opening, The Concord
Tribune, always most cooperative, carried a notice re-
qucsting each hobbyist to bring a small brush, sponge,
rags, newspapers, jars for glazes, and a small bowl for
water.

The committee established a long-term plan to have one
of their number responsible for answering questions and
sharing ideas at each session. The fact that all instruction
was to be done by volunteers released to us the money

that had been allotted for instruction ($247.50). Our to-

more than a hundred pieces had been made and fired.

The volunteers had not planned to teach. This room
was to be just a place to work and share ideas, and to keep
materials supplied at cost; but so many eager craftsmen-
to-be had so many questions that we found ourselves
teaching at a desperate rate. Soon each one who had
learned a bit was helping a new one and the group be-
came soundly constructive.

In encouraging the individuals to visualize the finished
product, each was asked if he wished to make a small or
large piece. One pound of clay will make a slab about 8
by 10 by 14 inches. After estimating the size of the
project, each one weighed his own clay; wrote a sales slip
with date, name, and cost carefully noted; and put the
money in a designated container.

We suggest having at hand white and red modeling clay
and white slip (liquid clay). Buy moist modeling clay by
the hundred pounds and sell it by the pound. Buy slip in
five-gallon containers and sell it by pint or quart. Red
clay, both modeling and slip, is resistant to thermal shock
and can be used for cooking dishes, especially if glazed
on only the inside. It is wise to use leadless glaze for this.

craft room can gain much from the following books:

tal now for equipment was $497.50, and we needed all of
it. One committee member advanced $100 to be returned
slowly in the form of materials used; so the total amount
available was about $600.

On the first day, March 15, twenty-six people enrolled
and each one made something. By the last week in April,

Our curriculum now offers a wide range'of processes

from start to completion of the product. After all the proc-

219

esses are complete, the pieces are measured (height by
width by depth) and charges figured at one cent per cubic
inch, which pays for glaze, firing and instruction all at one
time.

Our first session ran from March 15 to May 18, and the
summer session from June 15 to August 15. When the
summer budget was planned, the recreation commission al-
lotted money for a paid staff member (twenty hours a week
at $1.00 an hour) for the craft room. The committee had
found it would strengthen the program to have one re-
Sponsible member who could be present at all the sessions
to coordinate the planning, buying, firing the kilns, and
collecting and keeping accounts.

At the beginning of the summer program, the craft
group took one more forward step: equipping the metal
working room. The ceramics had built up a small cash
balance that could be used to buy the equipment.

The metal room Opened June 21 and a number of enam-
eled copper ash trays, hammered copper dishes, acid bite
monograms and hammered silver pieces were made. The
summer exhibition of ceramics and metal work was on
diSplay in the window of a local store for ten days and
attracted favorable attention from the community. A hun-
dred pieces were selected for the show.

On the walls of our craft room we have posted this
guide:

Rules and Regulations

1. This craft center is a place to be used by responsible
people who like to do creative work with their hands.

2. No previous training is necessary, but craftsmen and
artists with training are welcome to use tools and equip-
ment and should be willing to share their knowledge and
skill with those who have had no previous training.

3. Supplies purchased from the center, and cubic inches
of space used in the firing of kilns must be paid for when
ordered.

4. Each craftsman will be held responsible for leaving
the place as clean or cleaner than he found it.

5. Clean-up period will begin thirty minutes before clos-
ing time.
6. Each member will regard with respect the objects

made by fellow workers, especially those marked “Do not
touch!”

7. Any financial gains of the craft center shall be used

to maintain present equipment and provide additional
equipment as needed.

In addition to books on crafts offered by the Concord
Library, one worker has placed in the craft room her books,
and also a file of Ceramic Age magazine for five years and
Popular Ceramics for one year.

Our craft rooms are Open to all who wish to work in the

mediums we offer. Invitations are given repeatedly

through the local newspaper and by craftsmen themselves.

Please be assured that a craft room does not have to be
as elaborate as ours to be successful. A bag of clay, a few
sticks, a little glaze and a home-made kiln, can produce
good results. Detailed plans for a 9- by 9- by 121/3-inch
kiln costing less than $10 are given in Muriel Turoff’s book
How to Make Pottery. A kiln kit can be bought for less
than $50. For the metal working room, one saw, a pair of
snips, and two pairs of pliers can produce good jewelry
and flat silver without solder. A small blowtorch can be

added later.

None of us will say it is easy to set up a craft room;
but we can tell you that, for people who wish to create
something, there is nothing more full of meaning. We have
made new friendships and we have seen new facets in old
acquaintances. The philos0phy we deve10p when disap-
pointment must be accepted and a new start made braces
us for more serious demands, and the delights the crafts-
men share when something turns out well are memorable.

ADMINISTRATION

MOTIVATION

From a talk given at the Pacific-Southwest District
Recreation Conference, Long Beach, California.

T 00 OFTEN, we in municipal sports are accused of “pro-
moting and over-eXpanding our athletic programs for
selfish and bureaucratic justification.” The word promotion
has long been associated with unsavory connotations.
Thcrcfore, I prefer to use the word motivation instead of
promotion. For to motivate is defined “to create incentive,
cause motion.” As leaders, supervisors and administrators,
that is just what we do every day. We put sports activities
into action.
I wonder if the time has not arrived when we no longer
need to use high pressure methods in selling a philosophy or
" a program of sports participation to the youth and adults of
this nation. Today, we are recognized as men of a profes-

sion. We sit at the same table and break bread with re-
spected government officials, attorneys, engineers, medical
doctors, military officers, and educators.

I am suggesting a basic formula, prescribing the funda-
mental elements which, in the long run, if followed in mi-
nute detail, may contribute to the success of a particular
sports activity or program. This prescription may well be
applied to any recreation activity.

Publicity: Before we can get any activity rolling, we must
get the word to Mr. Citizen. We must assume that he knows
nothing of the activity—what the game is, how it is played,
when and where it can be played, what equipment is neces-
sary, how much it costs and who plays.

The avenues by which this information can be best dis-
seminated will be listed later. Getting the word to citizens
must be planned well in advance, presented while “hot”
and, above all, must be constant.

Preview: To arouse interest, it is well to devote consid-
able attention to the ‘fpreview.” An exhibition can be col-
orful, stimulating, and interesting; or it can be just plain
dull and monotonous. Often, the outstanding perfection of
technique and skill of a champion may discourage, rather
than encourage, participation. There also is the moral con-
duct of a champion to consider. ls he or she an honest, clean
sportsman, or a poor sportsman, poor loser? ln introducing
a new sport, do not hesitate to eXplain scoring, some rules
and regulations. Point out outstanding plays, shots or skills.

Demonstration: We should provide a demonstration by
well-known coaches or experts; they need not be the stars
or champs. During the demonstration session, we should
go into more detail as to various techniques, strategy, posi-

tion, skills or tricks of the trade. Sometimes it is well to
have a coach or past star handle the micr0phone, eXplain
the action and form of the contestants. A good gimmick
often employed is to take someone from the crowd who has
never seen or played the game before, and have the star or
coach give the person a few personal pointers. A sports di-
rector can secure excellent instruction films, or movies, of
an outstanding game, contest or tournament from sporting
goods dealers, local sports clubs or the Athletic Institute in
Chicago. These can be shown, with a narrator, prior to the
demonstration. Be sure to invite the press, park and recrea-
tion board members, potential officials and local old-time
stars or champs. The local former stars many times can
make or break a new activity or program.

Instruction (Individual) : We should have a well-planned
clinic, school or scheduled class organized, with instructors,
equipment, time and place all lined up. The length and
frequency of the classes, naturally, depend upon the activ-
ity. Schedule classes at a time most convenient to the great-
est possible number of participants. It might be well to run
two clinics at different times, or on different days. Stress
individual attention and instruction; and never hesitate to

Avenues of Motivation (Public Information)

1. Newspapers: Supply sports editors and writers with ma-
terial, personal invitations to tournaments, dinners and
special events.

2. News service: Send human interest stories, pictures,
names, daily games results, schedules, and tournaments to
the newspaper office in plenty of time prior to deadline.
Send special articles to magazines.

3. Photographs: Send pictures of teams, champions and ac-
tion shots to newspapers, magazines, park bulletin boards.

4-. Radio: Give sports announcers information on new and
special activities, tournaments, weekly schedules.

5. Television: Sports announcements and periodic televised
programs.

6. Motion pictures: Department action movies, instruction
movies, championship and Olympic movies can be shown as
part of clinics or entertainment programs.

7. Handbills and leaflets: Send to service and fraternal
clubs, veterans’ organizations, PTA’s, and other youth serv-
ing organizations; also distribute via utility bills.

8. Letterheads and envelopes with department insignia.

 

adapt the rules to your facilities or to the abilities of the
participants. In most instances, the department may find it
advantageous to provide all the equipment.

Ohicials: Officials are most important to the success of
any sports program, and every sports division should be
capable of selecting and training them. A contact with vari-
ous official associations will usually provide you with quali-
fied officials; however, the sports administrator must recog-
nize poor officiating. By training its own officials the de-
partment makes sure that they are well-versed in the rules
of the game and in the general policies of the department.

222

This system also affords complete control over the officials.
However, contracts between departments and official associ-
ations have often operated quite successfully. Too much
stress cannot be placed on the quality of officiating. 0f-
ficials can give a sports administrator more headaches than
any player, team, league or association, park board, or city
council. In most sports, one can find a national association
of officials and can secure rule books, qualification stand-
ards and written examinations. The securing and training
of officials should be done concurrently with preceding ele-
ments.

Teams and Leagues: Formation and classification of
teams, and organization of teams into leagues, are impor-
tant procedures. Usually, teams pick their own personnel,
but it may be necessary for the sports administrator to as-
sist team managers in this. It is well to keep the teams as
balanced as possible. A system of player registration, player
contracts, rules insuring that a player will participate, rules 1
prohibiting teams from “loading up” and protection of
sponsors against loss of equipment are items requiring con-
sideration. All sports administrators should concentrate on
providing a more complete understanding with the spon-

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  

9. Posters: Use on park and plant bulletin boards and in
sporting goods stores.

10. Direct Mail: Send monthly bulletins to newspapers, or-
ganizations, employee recreation clubs.

11. Postal cards: Use for announcements of tournaments,
schedules and special events. Cartoons attract attention.

12. Programs: May be printed and sold at games.

Id. Sports division booklets and rule books.

14. School Media: Papers, bulletin boards and coaches.

15. Activity and annual reports: Send to newspapers, maga-
zines, interested groups, members of park and recreation
board, council, city manager.

16. Miscellaneous: Tickets, book tickets, complimentary
tickets, gate prizes, bumper cards, public transportation and
taxi show cards.

17. Others: Exhibitions, clinics, sports movies, annual sports
show or award dinner, father and son nights, duffer leagues,
window displays, film announcements at local movie houses,
and announcements at teen-age dances.

sors on the Operation of the leagues. We have found that a
pre-league practice round, with each team playing three
games, usually enables us to do a pretty good job of classi-
fication and gives us a good opportunity to train, grade and
select our officials. Pre-league or pre-season tournaments
are less effective; tournaments should end, not start, a sea-
son. Six-team leagues playing three rounds with a run-off
between the winners of each round will prove most satisfac—
tory. Personally, I believe we are hurting a sport when we
extend our play the year round. Such a policy creates indi-
vidual sport specialists and sport illiterates, which is con-

v RECREATIOi

trary to the philosophy and objectives of a balanced recrea-
tion program.

Sports Association Committees: The sports administrator
should look around for good sport has-beens to head up the
protest committee, officials committee, tournament commit-
tee, banquet committee and other committees that a local
situation might demand. However, the administrator
should be very careful not to create a machine where, ulti-
mately, the tail might wag the dog.

Championship Contests and Tournaments: Championship
contests, or tournaments, are most essential to the motiva-
tion of any sports program, but, I wonder if we have not
been guilty of placing too much emphasis upon them. We
must have champions; however, haven’t we gone a little
overboard with our open tournaments, our invitational tour-
naments, our double eliminations and last, but not least,
good old Shaunnessy? We have, in most cases, already de-
termined our league champs and now we come up with an-
other champ. Personally, I’ll always be satisfied with league
champions and a city champ. Excessive tournaments are
costly and require too much in time, facilities, and per-
sonneL

Records and Standards: Individual and team records,
standings, and averages must be maintained, for while the

sports staffs have to burn midnight oil, and maybe miss
church on Sunday, such information provides interest to
the individual participant and, most of all, to local radio
and television announcers and sports writers. This infor-
mation should be placed on bulletin boards and posted on
the courts, ball fields, swimming pools, casting pools, arch-
ery ranges, tennis, basketball, volleyball and horseshoe
courts. Such information, mimeographed and sent to in-
dustries and sponsors will maintain interest and increase
attendance, especially at crucial games. At the start of
league play, have 8- by 10-inch pictures taken of every team.
Display these pictures by leagues—and you have your pic-
tures ready when the championship play-offs roll around.

Recognition: No sports program is complete without
some instrument whereby appropriate recognition is ex-
tended, not only for championships, but for sportsmanship
and outstanding officiating, the assistance of the 'press, the
volunteers, the sponsors, the association or club which has
backed your programs, and the committees who handled
the “hot potato” protests, finances, tickets, and so on, the
members of your staff who have unselfishly and loyally con-
tributed many hours beyond those paid for, and last, but
very important, the city fathers who allotted the money
which made possible your program.

National Conference on Sports Competition

The National Conferencc on Program Planning in Games
and Sports for Boys and Girls of Elementary School Age
was held in Washington, May 25 and 26, 1953, after our
last spring issue of RECREATION was off the press. Its pur-
pose was: to discuss programs and principles of competi-
tion; to determine the extent of agreement among the vari-
ous groups as to the correct program; and to ascertain what
areas should be explored to solve some of the existing prob-
lems. Group representatives on the steering committee
were: Mrs. Rollin Brown, National Congress of Parents and
Teachers; Dr. Ray 0. Duncan, American Association for
Health, Physical Education, and Recreation; Dr. Robert W.
Eaves, Department of Elementary School Principals; Mr.
F. S. Mathewson, American Recreation Society; Mr. Simon
A. McNeeley, Society of State Directors of Health, Physical
Education, and Recreation; Mr. Arthur Williams, National
Recreation Association. In addition to educational and
medical representatives, spokesmen for Little League Base-
ball, P0p Warner Foundation Football and Biddy Basket-
ball also sat in 011 the informal meetings.

This two-day conference is significant in that it marks, for
the first time, thc meeting of professional education, medi-
cal, and recreation leaders representing almost all organiza-
tions serving the child, with leaders of organizations which
promote highly competitive activities for children of ele-
mentary school age. These leaders assembled with a feeling
of good will and friendliness, and approached the problem

SEPTEMBER 1953

of establishing desirable practices of competition for chil-
dren in an objective manner. Except for one instance there
was complete absence of emotionalism. -
The conference report presents the following broad prin-
ciples, or criteria, to be used as a basis for planning pro-
grams for boys and girls of elementary school age:
1. Programs of games and sports should be based on the
developmental level of children. Boxing, tackle football,
ice hockey and other similar body contact sports should not
be included in any competitive program for children twelve
and under. (One dissenting vote)
2. These programs should provide a variety of activities for
all children throughout the year.
3. Competition is inherent in the growth and development
of the child and, depending upon a vaf'iety of factors, will
be harmful or beneficial to the individual.
4-. Adequate competitive programs organized on neighbor-
hood and community levels will meet the needs of these
children. State, regional and national tournaments, bowl,
charity and exhibtion games are not rccommended for these
age groups. (Three negative votes—two because it is not
strong enough and one not agreeing)
5. Education and recreation authorities and other com-
munity youth serving agencies have a definite responsibility
for the development of adequate neighborhood and com-
munity programs of games and sports and to provide com-
petent leadership for them.

WANY PARKS and recreation superinten-

dents have opportunities dropped in

their laps, but few ever reach the dimen-
sions which grew out of Vin Hebert’s situation in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts.

One day, early in October, when Vin was brushing up old
ideas and rounding up a few new ones for the city-wide Hal-
loween celebration whichiwas coming along, he had a visit
from a couple of friends. They were from the General
Electric Company’s Transformer Division, located in Pitts-
lield. and were anxious to do something for the “kids” on
Halloween. n

Such an attitude was most appreciated, but when the mat-
ter of putting a General Electric sign on the project was
proposed, Vin had to think fast—as no floats, posters, or
projects are allowed to have a commercial tinge. It was

Ilinally agreed that a dragon could be made and placed as

a centerpiece in the middle of Pittsfield’s beautiful Park
Square, where a sign and the story of the dragon could be
projected on a screen.

A few days later, however, Vin was called to the General
Electric Plant, where the dragon idea had got into the minds
of a few more of the company’s human dynamos, and the
plans evolved from a centerpiece to a huge, mobile, life-like
creature which would travel the entire route of the Hallo-
ween parade.

And what a monster! One hundred and fifty feet long,
fourteen feet high and sixteen feet wide at the wings!

Immediately, the “slide rule gang” got out their figuring
gadgets, the workers organized into teams; and manage-
ment joined labor as they geared for a production which
the entire population of Pittsfield would appreciate. While
sweepers handed tools to vice-presidents, and ideas were
swapped with stories, all shared in the enjoyment of doing

something for local youngsters. The park and recreation
department staff, meanwhile, was busy preparing for the
very special Halloween visitor.

First, the magnificent creature of the drawing board
must have a name. What could be a better one than Pitt,
because surely the place of its birth was to be Pittsfield . . .
and how easily it could lend itself to the new Halloween leg-
end of how Pittsfield got its name.

DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION
Radio Release

Early Talk of Monsters Sends Parks and Recrea-
tion Superintendent on Research Study

Vin Hebert, superintendent of Parks and Recreation
Department, reported today that his Halloween rec-
ords show conclusively that many years ago the earth
was visited by a tremendous dragon named Pitt, who
had a reputation for being the kindest, gentlest dragon
that ever blew a flame.

In fact, Pitt’s mother had to he cross with him on
several occasions for 'being late to dinner because he

was playing with the cavemen’s little children. It
seems that Pitt, who was as tall as the trees, used to lift
the children up on his back where they could see for
miles around and, after taking them for a ride around
the country on his big back, would let them slide down
his side in much the same'fasbion as the children of
today do on the playground slides.

Mr. Hebert stated that the Department of Parks and
Recreation would he more than pleased to have a visit
from Pitt, the kindly dragon, and he felt sure that
Pitt’s field—or the place where the dragon might
choose to roam—would be an attraction to children for
miles around because Pitt was so gentle, kind and
harmless.

After naming the dragon-toibe, the next step was to cre-
ate suspense without revealing too much. A picture was
staged at one of the larger parks, in which the curator of
the local museum was shown measuring a tremendously
large footprint with a yardstick, and a catchy by-line was
prepared to go along with an appropriate story.

Three more publicity build-up stories: the neighboring
lakcs were to rise a few inches sometime between 2:00 and
3:00 A.M. and according to a roving policeman’s report a
monster was supposed to be taking a bath at that time; a
building was to be brushed about fourteen feet high, with
the release of some strange tales concerning what made the
marks on the wall; and other footprints were to appear
throughout the city on routes which would be traveled by
the children on their way to school.

Unfortunately, the fame of the local museum’s curator,
who posed in the picture, was such that the authenticity of
the giant footprint took on Orson Wells proportions and the
Police Department—with reluctance and in a very sad man-
nor—informed the Department of Parks and Recreation
that steps must be taken -immediately to calm some of

ADMINISTRATION

Program and the

Community School

THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL, or the combined school-recrea-

tion center, has been the subject of a great deal of writ-
ing and research during recent years. This research has
stressed the importance of jointly planned land procure-
ment and development, and building design, aimed toward
providing facilities suitable for joint use by both education
and recreation agencies. This idea of joint facility plan-
ning is thoroughly sound. It provides facilities which are
better designed and equipped than those of the past, and it
provides these better facilities at less expense than if they
were built as entirely separate recreation and education
units.

There is, however, another equally important factor in
the concept of the community school which has not been
st-resscd or developed sufficiently. This other factor is the
jointly planned program of recreation-education sports and
IGisure-time activities. Without a permanent arrangement
for careful planning and close cooperation between educa-
tion and recreation agencies using the same facilities, the
finest designed plant can become the scene of squabbling,
conflict and confusion, as far as program operation is con-
Clmed. In most instances where school facilities are used
jchtly by education and recreation, a large percentage of
the children and youths take part in the programs of both
agencies. That is, they attend the school during school
hours, taking part in intramurals, physical education and
extracurricular activities; and they also participate in the
recreation program utilizing the same school facilities after
tool hours, during evenings and on Saturdays. When

' seemingly obvious fact is ignored and the two programs
Mnot dovetail, the boys and girls become confused and
.311 lose interest in both programs. For example, during
it past fall season, one recreation department opened a

touch football program for boys on a local junior high
school field. Interest was only mild and attendance lagged.
It was only after two discouraging weeks that the disinter-
ested attitude was explained. The physical education de-
partment of the same school was promoting intramural
soccer on a large scale at that very time, having announced
to the gym classes that their “own” touch football program
would begin several weeks later. Pre-season joint planning
and “dovetailing” could have avoided this conflict, and

would undoubtedly have increased interest and attendance
all around.

To make this cooperative plan work, it is required at the
outset that both the recreation and education agencies in-
volved sacrifice some of their autonomy and independencc
in curriculum and program planning, and work together to-
ward a compromise program, adaptable to both. It is rec-
ommended that meetings be scheduled semiannually be-
tween representatives of both the recreation and education
departments for the purpose of formulating coordinated ac-
tivity programs. These meetings might be held in June for
the coming fall and winter programs, and in January for
the coming spring. All sports and activities in which both
departments or agencies might be concerned would be dis-
cussed at these meetings and a coordinated schedule or pro-
gram could be set up. Sports and leisure-time activities .
common to both agencies would constitute the mainstays of
such a program and these should be scheduled so that they
complement each other. For example, the teaching of bas-
ketball fundamentals ought to begin in school a few weeks
in advance of the opening of basketball team organization
and league play by the recreation agency. When an activity
or sport is to be included'in only one of the two agency
programs, an effort should be made to schedule this activity
so that it will not compete with the program of the other de-
partment or agency. This may, in some cases, mean a fairly
simple joint program in the beginning, but this should not

227.

prove a deterrent. A simple, but well-coordinated program
of school-recreation activities is far more effective than two
complex, separate programs which frequently hamper each
other through conflicts or duplication of effort. An example
of an informal approach to this c00peration may be seen in
the following. Recently, a community recreation group was
planning an extensive Halloween window painting contest.
Ordinarily, the community and the local merchants would
handle all arrangements, including registration of teams,
judging, and so on. This time, however, a slightly different
approach was attempted. The art teachers in all four local
high schools were approached and asked to handle the
project in each of their respective schools. Each art teacher
served as the contest representative in her school, announc-
ing the contest and rules, suggesting themes and ideas, dis-
tributing and collecting entry blanks and carrying on the
other necessary details. When the contest took place, the
number of participants was far greater than anticipated and
the quality of work was excellent. One of the art teachers
remarked later that this was the first time she had ever been
brought actively into such a community project. “Ordinar-
ily,” she said, “we hear of such contests and art shows
through the students. Community groups contact the chil-
dren and rarely ask our opinions when plans are being
drawn up.”

Physical education, of course, offers the greatest oppor-
tunities for joint education-recreation planning. The ex-
tensive sports programs operated by most public recreation
agencies often run parallel to the intramural and varsity
programs of the local schools. Working together, the school
and the recreation department can make great strides in the
teaching and deveIOpment of basic skill techniques which
are so important physically and mentally to growing youth.
The school is best equipped to teach the skills used in sports
and leisure-time activities. Recreation is bcst equipped to
provide a pleasurable program framework within which the
individual can, voluntarily, use and deve10p those basic
skills learned in school. Attendance at school is compul-
sory; hence it provides the better teaching or training situ-
ation. Participation in recreation is voluntary and provides
greater Opportunities for the exercising of new skills, not
only in physical education but in all forms of leisure-time
pursuits. This does not imply that recreation should take
over the running of intramural and varsity sports, or that
the school go no further than teaching only basic skill tech-
niques. It does imply that both education and recreation
‘ are, to an extent, specialties, and that by improving their
respective specialties while working together, they can pro-
duce a much more effective over-all program of skill teach-
ing and development in their students and participants.

Another important reason for the jointly planned pro-
gram is the economy involved. For example, the same type
of equipment and supplies are purchased simultaneously by
both education and recreation. Step into any large school
gymnasium during daytime gym class or team practice and
you’ll probably see four or five basketballs in use. Visit
that same gymnasium during evening recreation programs
and chances are you’ll see four or five different, recreation-

228

purchased, basketballs in play or practice. When both sets of
balls are being purchased with public funds, duplication is
wasteful. Such equipment should be purchased and used
jointly. Additional economies would include: reduced ex-
penditures for heating and lighting school buildings, over-
time payments to janitorial help and extra leadership per-
sonneL

Alert citizen groups are becoming increasingly interested
in the advantages connected with this joint programming
by education and recreation. Herein lies a point on which
education, in general, has not been as progressive as it
might be. Community use of the schools is increasing, not
merely because recreation agencies have encouraged the
idea, but because of genuine p0pular demand. The people
are taking closer looks at their schools and facilities, and
they feel more possessive of these plants than ever before.
Education, for the most part, is cooperating by opening
gymnasiums, clubrooms, workshops, and so on, so that com-
munity groups may use them. Too often, however, here is
where the cooperation begins and ends. Little apparent in-
terest is shown in the planning of the recreation program or
in its problems and accomplishments. School authorities
frequently appear to view the school-recreation program as
a “Johnnie-come-lately,” or as an uninvited foster child
thrust into education’s home. Community groups partici-
pating in school-recreation programs sense and resent this
attitude and are increasingly favoring more recreational use
of our newer school plants.

“School grounds and gyms are being more extensively
used for recreation activities. . . . The added burden on
school budgets is insignificant compared with the benefits
derived and the gain in community good will. . . . There
is every evidence that it will be increasingly difficult to pro.
cure the funds necessary for increased teachers’ salaries,
and for the additional teachers, school buildings and equip-
ment necessary to provide educational facilities for a greatly
increased school p0pulation certain to be enrolled in public
schools at least throughout the late fifties and the sixties.
The need for greatly extended and more effective public re-
lations efforts is clearly indicated.”*

Education and recreation leaders, heeding this rising tide
of p0pular feeling, should plan jointly so as to dovetail on
such basic items as time schedules, purchase of equipment.
number, age and sex of participants, and responsibility for
maintenance where school buildings are being used by both
departments. Thus, over-all effectiveness of both depart-
ments will be increased, sizable economies will be realized
and the progressive thinking of both public agencies will be
evident to citizens using the school facilities.

An important phase of the groundwork for effective joint
program planning must be a complete revamping of our
concept of the function of the school in the community.
Many of the stock ideas need replacing by newer, sounder
concepts. Teachers and recreation leaders must study and
appreciate the problems of each other and act accordingly'

ecreation leaders, this step should not be difficult. How-
ver, the thinking must reach t0p level as well, for here the
ap between the departments can best be narrowed.

Some specific examples of program activities in which
Ioth education and recreation can c00perate effectively:

'ARADES

Education—may contribute music, bands,
art work, floats, signs, dramatic skits, and
costumes.

3wreation—may contribute publicity, community contacts,
rizes, line of march, police contacts and permits.

PORTS Education—contact with students, assem-
bly demonstrations, skill training in gym
classes, first aid, visual aids, trained per-

sonnel, and sports clinics.

fecreation—tournaments, prizes, publicity, special events,
Iygrounds.

IAMATICS Education—English classes, eXpericnced

teachers, assembly programs, dramatics,
make-up and dressmaking classes.

Recreation—dramatics clubs, theater parties, plays, work-
shops, visits by celebrities, playwriting contests, publicity,
prizes, television and radio, teen centers and playgrounds.

ARTS AND
CRAFTS

Education—woodworking, shep, art class-
es, instruction, trained personnel, school
displays, teachers with special interests.

Recreation—community displays, art shows, contests,
prizes, publicity, trips to other locations, hobby and craft
clubs, community art and craft shows, playgrounds.

The list is almost unlimited and could include such addi-
tional activities as concerts, socials, playground activities,
and activities of many other types.

The community whosc school buildings and grounds rep-
resent the result of joint planning by local education and
recreation departments is fortunate indeed. Now, let that
community put its school-recreation plant to the most effec-
tive and economical use possible by instituting the other
equally important factor, the jointly planned program of
education-recreation sports and leisure-time activities.

HOSPITAL BECBEATION

Bertha Carlson

Hospital recreation is relatively new. While “cheering
he sick” has been in vogue for many many years, especially
n hospitals and institutions, it was only during the recent
at that techniques and principles were deve10ped to give
his program mcaning within a medical setting.

lRecreation for the sick and injured is an important ad-
unct to medical care and treatment. Experiences during
H recent war proved that patients in military hospitals re-
'wrated much more rapidly when they participated in re-
'ojditioning and rehabilitation programs provided by the

\i'tny and Navy, and in the recreation programs of the
lrhtrican Red Cross.

Recreation in civilian hospitals has been largely confined
0 those installations treating the crippled, the tubercular,
he mentally ill, and children. Only recently has the general
lospital sought to initiate the program for their patients.
rho exhaustive study completed by the Social Service De-
Jartment at the University of Michigan Hospital indicates
he value of recreation in a civilian hospital:

- Sickness enters the life of the individual at some point to require
pften a complete re-evaluation of objectives, interests, and attain-
ments and relationships. The student who seizes this opportunity to
ttudy and learn realities has added tools to his equipment which
my not only be satisfying and time consuming but valuable in ap-
plication to other fields. As the disability and isolation of illness

ginee it is out of such confidence that healthful attitudes are main-
tained and personality growth takes place.

AS greater emphasis is placed on postwar rehabilitation,

for both military and civilian casualties, it is important to
consider the relationship of recreation to the complete social
rehabilitation of the handicapped.

Therapy—~Recreation must be related to treatment and care
of the patient and recovery or progress. However, recrea-
tion as defined here should not be confusediwith therapy.
Therapy is specialized treatment prescribed by the medical
profession in the same sense as medicine and diet. The
distinction between therapy and recreation is often diflicult
for the lay person to grasp, especially when end results of
both appear to have therapeutic value. The therapist works
with patients, referred by medical staff, whose needs and
treatment have been carefully defined and noted. Although
the therapist may utilize recreational activities as a medium
for treatment, participation is enforced or encouraged to
the extent that it becomes involuntary and thus, not recrea-
tion. True recreation implies voluntary participation with
choice and selection of activities. The nature of the partici-
pation determines to a great extent whether’the program is
recreation or therapy.

Rehabilitation—The term rehabilitation as used here refers
to an over-all program, with recreation as one part. Rehab-
ilitation promotes both physical and mental reconditioning
activities which aid the individual in becoming independent
—physically, mentally, and economically. In this plan rec-
reation is more than an activity; it is a dynamic force, in-
tegrating desires and achievements into socially useful liv-

ing.

MASK MAKING

—-A Project in Education and Recreatim

IN PLANNING a mask project for school children, program

chairmen can call upon the cooperation of the art de-

partment in doing historical research and design, making
scenery, costumes, posters, and playbills; vocational classes
in woodwork can build the stage; the electrical shop can do
lighting and sound effects; the English department can
write the scripts for mask pantomimes, to be spoken off
stage; history, geography and literature departments can
find themes; dramatics can direct the mask pantomimes;
music may provide the desired background. Mask making
is especially important in the elementary grades. It gives
the children a creative experience in art and in drama. The
mask can introduce very young children to museums and
libraries. The teachers or educational workers can take
small groups of children to the city museums. Here they
can see authentic masks and view Special films on masks.
In playgrounds, in parks, and in settlement houses, mask
making could be a creative activity popular with young and
old alike. A pantomime theatre group working with masks
could be helpful in traveling to entertain camps, USO’s,
hospitalized soldiers, polio victims, cerebral palsy children
and the many underprivileged and other handicapped chil-
dren or adults.

“Oh, I’m scared of masks,” say most children; or, “I
know what masks are,” say others. Of course the types of
masks with which the children are familiar are the Hallo-
ween face, the black bandit’s mask, a rubber mask, a mardi
gras head mask, a gas, firefighter, or hospital gauze mask.
The average child, or most of us for that matter, has no
knowledge of the meaning or the history of the mask. We
don’t learn about it in text books. We get little of it from
clay modeling classes. It has been my good fortune, how-
ever, to travel and to collect masks, and to open up a new
field in the ancient art of mask making. Sometime ago I
became a member of the Archaelogical Institute of America
and became extremely interested in reviving the old Greek,
Roman, and commediae dell’arte or Italian masks, that
were worn in the theatrical productions of the times.

Origin of Masks

What’s a mask? It is far more than a protective coverin
for the face. Masks were worn by the Cro-Magnon rac
more than 30,000 years ago. Evidences of this are seen i
pictures scratched on the walls of the caves in the Pyrenec
mountains in southern France. The cave men, it is believe:
put on the mask-heads of animals to frighten away anim
from the mouths of their caves. Masks and mask make
were very popular in the fifth century in Rome and 5
Greece. Tragedy, comedy and satirical masks were mat
and worn by actors. Early masks were crudely fashion:
of linen; others were made of a mixture of leaves, smear
with oil. Even today in Bali, Java, Japan, China, Tib
Africa, Mexico, in the South Pacific Islands, masks are wo
in dances, in religious ceremonials, to drive out evil spiri
to promote the growth of crops, and to ward off disease a
sickness.

   
   
    
  
 

RECREATI

The purposes of masks are to protect, to disguise, to con-
ceal, and to imitate. I have had thrilling experiences with
masks. My daughter, now seven, and I have spent some
time on an Iroquois Indian reservation. We visited bark
houses, wore carved wooden “false-face” society masks. I
had been working and studying masks for some time, when
I came across a book called Masks and How to Make Them
by Doane Powell. His masks were entirely different from
the great W. T. Benda’s theatrical masks. They were of
laminated paper, and actual head masks of people. “Por-
trait masks,” Powell called them. Some time later I met this
amazing Powell, and he invited me to visit his mask studio.
I did. We worked together for several years and had the
time of our lives creating animal, half-masks, and masks of
living people. When he died, in 1951, he left me his collec-
tion which portrayed such people as our presidents, Will
Rogers, W. C. Fields, Buffalo Bill, Mark Twain, movie and
stage celebrities, and all kinds of animals. Added to my
own sculptured masks and ancient collected ones, this en-
phled me to open a mask museum on the top floor of my
home. It is now visited by children, students, and people
from all parts of the world.

I believe that the mask offers an exciting outlet for crea-
tive expression. You find yourself—whether working with
# children, in TV, or in the theatre—drawing, designing,

deling. You learn to develop colors, caricature, and

rn so much about racial types, the drama, religion, people
and cultures involved in the type of mask you are doing.
When I did my Tibetan delnon mask, Yammantakka, I
found myself learning about yaks, butter tea, lamas and
Eir religion (Lamaism), what the people eat, how they
ss, what they think! So it has been my desire to have the
.ask accepted as a serious medium for portraiture, taking
- Its place with painted and sculptured portraits. Masks have
niversal appeal for the young child as well as the adult.

When a mask is hung on the wall, it is static. But put it
and it becomes alive. An oil portrait is only two dimen-
onal; and a bust has all the dimensions, but lacks the illu-
n of life. When you come into my mask lnuseum, reach
up and put on Churchill or President Eisenhower or. Joan
Crawford or Cable, the mask actually seems to come to life.

 
   

Teachers and recreation leaders could help to revive this
ancicnt art of mask making by incorporating a mask project
'mto their programs. Just give a pound of plasticine and a

 

rait masks of actual people made from laminated paper.

simple tool such as an orangewood stick or an ice cream
stick to a child, and a few pictures of masks, or the actual
mask itself, and watch him work.

   

A Simple Way to Make a Mask

Materials—Do not purchase the colored sticky modeling
clay. Even some of the plasticines on the market are crum-
bly, and harden. Clays ordered from supply houses are
good if the masks are to be fired in electric kilns. But if
the groups want to work on an inexpensive basis, buy about
twenty-five pounds of roma plasticina #2. This is about
thirty cents a pound, but is soft, will never stick to the
child’s hands, and can be used over and over again. Let the
young sculptors design any type of mask, authentic or im-
aginative. When finished with their modeling, they can cast.

Don’t let the idea of making elaborate plaster of Paris piece
molds alarm you, as leaders or teachers. Simply, buy a
pint or a quart of casting rubber. It is a thick, milky liquid
and will make perfect rubber casts into plaster molds with-
out the use of heat or kilns. Very young children can cover
their plasticine models with about three coats of liquid rub-
ber. When it has dried, the rubber mold will peel right off.

Next Steps—Mix up a small batch of plaster of Paris with
water; pour this mixture over the rubber mold that is still
over the object to be cast. This makes the outside protective
coating or thick wall. In about twenty minutes the outside
shell will be hard. Have the group turn their designs over
and remove the plasticine. Now they are ready to fill the
rubber mold with plaster of Paris. Again mix a batch of
plaster of Paris with just enough water to make a soupy
mixture. Carefully pour this into the rubber mold that is
held in a firm position by the previously made shell. When
the cast is hardened, .the instructor can cut the outside case
in half, and the finished plaster cast is done.

Now comes the fun—the painting. The best way is with
oils, ground in japan. A good trick is the coating of plaster
casts with a thin coat of clear linoleum lacquer, which costs
about seventy cents a quart. This, later on, helps the oils
to adhere to the plaster. In addition to oils, any of the
many colors of bronzing powders now on the market are
most effective on any kind of plaster masks, and can be
sprinkled directly on the sticky lacquer and then blown off.
These are particularly good for Greek, Roman, or any of
the South Sea type of masks. They can be decorated with
bits of feathers, shells, sharks teeth (they cost a penny each
at the bookstore in the American Museum of Natural His-
tory in New York). Other art groups, with kilns at their
disposal, can use the good clays and have the masks fired.
The results are beautiful masks in ceramic glazes of gold,
platinum, bronzes, and colors. I have done many of these.
But for a simple and direct method of having a mask project
in sculpture, stick to the plasticine-rubber-plaster way. It

is cheaper and faster. This is the way to make a mask as a
wall piece. The children like to make a gift, take something
home, or hang it up. But if they want to make masks to
wear, 'do this:

Masks to Wear

One of the most exciting creative experiments for adults
and children is the making of a face mask to wear. To keep
the project simple, do not attempt the first one with hair
or ears. Just have the group design a face mask. Let it be
up-to-date and timely. Collect good newspaper and maga-
zine photos .of all angles of the person’s face to be done.
It could be a national or inter-

national figure, or an ex-

Small children can use, as
a base, an old inverted tea-cup and practice on a small mask.
Step I. Tear, do not cut, paper into strips 3 by 6 inches.
Using both the newsprint and the brown paper, soak the
strips, neatly criss-crossed, in a pail of cold water for a
whole day. When the paper is ready to apply, squeeze the
water out. Step 2. You are ready to paper over the com-
pleted clay model. Use brown paper for the first layer; then
alternate with the newsprint; and with a third layer of the
brown paper. The reason for this is that, while you are do-
ing the papering, you can see the areas that have been cov-
ered, and it is easier to paint the last layer if it is brown
paper and not the printed paper. Keep it in mind to always
have the paper wet while you are working; if not, the paper
dries too fast and falls off. Now, after the first layer of
brown paper has covered the mask, you are ready to smear
paste to make the paper adhere to the second layer. I can
here reveal a great secret in finding a good paste. So many
masks have been ruined by using glue, home-made flour-
and-water paste, and dime store mucilage. However, a dex-
trine, called tapioca dextrine—which is like mother’s corn-
starch powder on the kitchen shelf—when used as follows
will give a creamy textured adhesive. Buy one pound of the
tapioca dextrine at any high-grade food market; this will
be sufficient to make twelve face masks. Now, using one-
half cup of the dextrine, add it to one-half cup of boiling
water; mix; when cooled smear it well into the paper on
the mask. Step 3. When the first layer of paper is on and
has adhered, do exactly the same thing with the newsprint,
and then with the last layer of brown paper. Make sure that

spots; mark places for nose and eye openings.

Now the masks are ready to paint.

Beginners can use water paints; advanced students ca]
use the finest paints, the oils ground in japan. Two coat
are needed to make a good paint job. The inside of the fac:
mask can be painted with ordinary Hat wall paint. Bits 0
picture wire can be inserted at each side of the face masl
where the ears would be, thus letting the wearer show hi:
own ears. The wire is attached by sticking the ends to th:
inner edge of the last layer of the paper with a small bit 0‘
sticky plastic wood which costs but a few cents a can in thu
dime stores.

Groups could do a whole political, animal, movie, 01
celebrity array, or a series of face masks, and stage a pan
tomime or a short dramatic play. Good authentic record:
of the speeches of famous men can be rented or purchaset
and can be played while your “celebrities” parade across
the stage. History is made with your masks.

Whether recreational groups, camps, settlement houses
workshops, schools or individual elementary children use
these suggested ideas of mask making for a project of por
trait masks to wear, or for replicas of Greek, Roman, 01
islands masks, they will have experimented with theii
hands; they will have gone to the museums and libraries:
they will have learned more of history, the dance, theatre.
and the religion of far places; and they will have found the
doorway to adventure.

With wars constantly at the doors of so many countries
that do use masks, it is now becoming harder to find new
mask makers in the field—too much invasion, and influx of
western civilizations. Even now you have to go into the
most remote villages in Bali and Siam to find a few remain-
ing mask makers.

Remember: “As the eyes are supposed to be the windows
to the soul, the face may be the window to a civilization.”
And that face may be a “mask” that can lead you into past
cultures of ancient Japan, old Cambodia, Tibet, Africa, the
South Seas, and anywhere that your creative and imagina-

tive hands start working.

DOES YOUR COMMUNITY understand the value of

art activity for children, and why your department
tries to- promote it? Perhaps an educational project is the
answer. Try an exhibition, told largely through photo-
graphs. Work with the art department of the schools, your
state board of education, local amateur and professional
photographers, the local PTA, and other community agen-
cies in organizing it, selecting the material to be used, and
in mounting the exhibit. Work with the press, the radio,
TV and any other medium of publicity in publicizing it
and inviting the entire community to visit it. Make it col-
orful, dramatic and full of human interest. Keep it on ex-
hibition long enough for everyone to visit it—two to four
weeks perhaps.

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City spon—
sored such an exhibition. The general title of it was “The
Illuman Quality in Creative Experience.” The exhibit con-
sisted of eighteen large panels of photographs of children
at home, in school and at play. Explanatory captions
pointed out the right and wrong ways to encourage chil-
dren’s creative development. Children’s works in art—
painting, sculpture, mobiles and design—supplemented the
photographs. Recommended art materials and toys were
also shown.

The first panel was headed “Look at the Child as Well
as His Work,” and warned that “without reference to the
particular child, the work has little meaning.” Paintings
by children could be glimpsed through a large, eye-shaped
hole next to a photograph of a child concentrating on
making a picture.

Another panel, headed “We Learn About the World
Through Our Fingertips,” showed a selection of collages.
These were made by pasting different kinds of materials“
cTophane, shells, felt scraps, tinsel, wool, and so on—on
a ackground of paper.

Still another panel, titled “We Explore Materials and
Clieate New Forms,” showed photographs of children work-

comprehensive.

Too often we in the recreation profession publicize and
promote what we have to offer, but assume that our com-
munities understand why. We forget that before we get
full support, we must have full understanding of the values
of what we offer. Public education is a large part of our
j ob—but a very neglected part. Educational exhibits, such
as the type described in this article, will do more to create
interest in and understanding of our program than all the
directories, lists, maps, and newspaper stories of coming
events put together.

Such an exhibition should be a combined effort. All the
agencies interested in the problems of child growth, rec-
reation and mental health should be brought into it. The
work involved in preparing such an exhibit includes its
planning, the collection of photographs and examples of
the various types of children’s art work, mounting and set-
ting up the exhibit in the city auditorium, a museum, a
library, a department store, or a recreation building, and
finally, the dismounting and returning of the photographs
and art work to the owners. If pr0perly set up, no super-
vision of the exhibit will be necessary. If your art super- '
visor can be on hand at definite periods, a consultation
service could be a useful addition.

After such an exhibit, be prepared for many inquiries on
the part of parents as to where their youngsters can come
for such classes. And be prepared to offer an art program
that is creative, informaln—and fun!

S0 YOU’RE

A PROGRAM
PLANNER

 

Perhaps you hadn’t put it in just those words, but we feel
safe in betting that you are a program planner—because
practically anybody having anything to do with groups
(and that’s practically everybody) is, at one time or an-
other. After all, “program” is just a term for what people
do in groups—whether for an hour, an evening, or a year
(in a classroom, clubroom, or living room)—-—and planning
adds up to getting ready for the “doings” before they’re
done.

Most activities need some planning, even if it only
amounts to a mental survey, some hastily otted notes, or a
telephone call or two.

But as activities, events, or programs begin to involve
more than one or two people, and as the world we live in
becomes more and more complex, the things to be thought
of and prepared ahead of time begin to grow more numer-
ous and complicated. This becomes doubly true when we
aim for good and better programs as, again, almost every-
body does.

The ob you have as program planner is primarily one of
bringing order and sequence, as well as enjoyment and ful-
fillment, to the activities of your group. The ease and suc-
cess with which you can do this will depend a great deal
upon the attitudes and skills you bring to it. Program plan-
ning is a pleasure if you have confidence and the promise of
success. The attitude that you will be working with people,

rather than doing things for people, will do much to build
confidence and insure success, and will enable you to share
responsibilities with others. I f you have the job of planning
big or little programs you will want to consider . . .

Working With a Planning Committee

When a committee meets for the first time to work on a
new problem, it helps to begin in a way which orients the
members (a) to one another, and (b) to the common task
which they have been brought together to perform. Some
biographical bits from each committee member might be a
good starting point, followed by a discussion built around
the questions:

What are the ingredients of a good program?

What can each member of this committee (using his par-
ticular skills and experience) do to help build a good
program?

After the committee works out a list of the elements of a
good program, further discussion can bring out the rela-
tions between these elements and the resources of individual
skills and experience available in the committee. Suppose,
for example, that the committee has agreed that one element
of a good program is that it deals with the needs and interj
ests of the memhers. The committee might try to see thi.
and other aims in relation to such questions as:

Which people in the groups have skills or talents tha

can be used in the program?

Which people are members of circles of friends withir
the larger organization?

Which people represent points of view on subjects of i
terest or controversy that should be considered in th
program?

RECREATIO

These suggestions, primarin designed for Ieaders of aduIt meetings or elasses,
present good, basic pIanuing ideas and procedures for leaders of any groups.
They are, of course, partieularly adaptabIe to the young aduIt program.

Which people have contacts outside the group with which

our group should be familiar?

There are several advantages, in addition to orientation,
in discussing the program in relation to committee person-
nel. Such discussion can:

Reveal skills and interests not ordinarily associated with

particular persons.

Reveal arcas in which the committee may need some re-
inforcelnent.

And, perhaps most important, provide a basis on which
the committee can build an agenda for future work
and delegate responsibilities to committee members in
relation to their skills and interests.

Before starting to build a program, the committee will want
to consider ways and means of . . .

Determining Needs and Interest

Program committees composed of people who are well
acquainted with the membership often have a great deal of
information about what their groups want. Nevertheless,
it is always a good idea to start with some planned proced-
ures to determine needs and interests. First of all, guesses
by a few people can often be wrong. We are all tempted to
think in terms of what people ought to have rather than
what they want. In addition, asking people what they want
involves them in the planning itself and gives them a stake
in its success.

There are several ways of linding out what people need
and want. For general information on the current interests
'of people, a little informal “research” can produce some
good clues. Some simple procedures are:

(I) Watch your newspapers for a month and tabulate
the subjects that receive greatest emphasis. (2) Talk with
your librarian about what kinds of books and magazines
seem to be most popular. (3) Exchange program announce-
ments with other organizations like yours and see what is
of interest to their mcmbers.

your group there are of course many more direct avenues to
information. Among them are:

(1) Interviews
Each member of the program committee might take a
list of five or ten members to interview by phone or
face-to-face. The committee should determine before-
hand what questions to ask.

(2) Informal Conversation
We added this category upon receiving a letter from
Dorothy Hewitt, director of the Boston Center of Adult
Education and one of the most experienced program

 

not for peeple but with people

planners in the country, which read: “It seems to me
that the degree of success we experience as program
planners is determined by our ability to put ourselves
in the places of as many people as possible. The nearer
we come to being a mirror of the inmost desires of the
people around us, the nearer we come to success. I lind
that in just ‘passing the time of day’ with people I get
all sorts of clues and program ideas that I should never
get from directly asking them. An ever increasing
ability to listen to what people say is one of the best

sources I know for discovering what people are think-
ing about.”

(3) A Meeting Census
Ask the members to cluster into groups of six or eight.
Each cluster should choose a spokesman, then take ten
minutes to list their pregram choices. Then each
spokesman can report his list to a central secretary
who compiles them into a master list.. Interest can be
increased by writing the list on a blackboard if one
is available. (This is the “buzz group” technique
which is useful for many other activities where the
direct and active participation of a large group is de-
sired.)

(4) Registration Cards |
Have them filled out when people enter. Allow space
for indicating background and interests.

(5) Suggestion or Question Boxes
Place them where they are accessible to all and certain
to be noticed.

(6) Questionnaires

An important step in the process of determining needs
and interests is interpreting the responses that are received.
It is well to keep in mind that none of these techniques can
give conclusive evidence and that the final test always lies in
trying out ideas to see how closely you have come to satis-
fying real needs and interests.

In tabulating questionnaires you might use a rating sys-
tem which gives, for example, two points to a “very much”
response and one point to a “some” response. It is also
helpful to:

(1) Take into consideration the extent to which the re-
sponses are representative of the total membership.

(2) Separate the conclusions that you can be certain of,
those that are only probable, and those that provide
bases for good hunches only. (By no means disregard
the hunches—try them out—experiment with them—
but recognize that they are hunches.)

(3) Study the negative responses carefully. They may shed
valuable light on needs and interests.

By whatever method your group determines its neerls and

interests, from crystal balls to scientific sampling, the next

step is . . .

236

Delinng Your Objectives

People and groups always get farther when they move
towards clear goals or objectives. A little time Spent b)
the planning committee in defining the objectives of the
group can do much to save confusion and increase the qual.
ity of the product when it begins, later on, actually to build
its program.

Many organizations have stated objectives. These ob
jectives, in combination with those that come from informa
tion on the needs and interests of the members, form th:
outer and inner bounds of the group’s objectives. In tht
actual operation of groups, these objectives present them
selves in an interwoven network so that some of them ma]
become hidden from plain view. A helpful means for un
jumbling the many possible objectives is to classify then
into:

(1) Those based on the needs and interests of members a:
indiuiduals
Such as:
To become a better parent
To develop better speaking habits
To make some new friends
(2) Those based on the needs and interests of the gran]
or organization
Such as: ‘
To increase our funds
To get more members
To deve10p better public relations
(3) Those based on the needs and interests of the com
munity, the nation, or the world
Such as:
To learn about housing conditions in our city
To promote industrial peace in our state
To further international understanding

An alert planning committee will usually derive man
more goals than can be accomplished within the time avail
able, so it must rate the goals according to priority, siftin
out the most important, and holding over the rest.

Usually, in working to achieve one objective—develq

, ing skills in working with children, for example—other in

portant objectives are also achieved. It would be hard t
imagine the development of such skills in a parent or

teacher without an accompanying development of appropr.
ate attitudes, knowledge, and understanding.

“Conversation pieces” are ice
breakers that are bound to keep
your club buzzing with interest.

troduction between peeple, but
they lend a feeling of fellowship

his name, military address, and home
address according to state are there-
fore natural conversation pieces. These
books find long lost friends and give
information of possible new friends
from a geographical area of mutual
interest.

If your club has a television room,
why not include a ballot box at its en-
trance and make it a daily activity to
have a vote on the outcome of some
event. For one day it could be a prize
fight, a wrestling match, an academy
award nomination, or other occurrence

of current interest.

This type of conversation piece can be
used for various programs and activi-
ties, depending upon the location, type
of club, and age of men who generally
attend the club. Its possibilities may
not be as broad as other methods, but,
when used as a possible “Kilroy” meth-
od, it can add humor to many activi-
ties and situations.

The top tunes on the hit parade can

can be quickly and attractively done;
then stand by for resulting interest as
the men discuss the pros and cons of
the current crop of tunes.

Have the men submit

for a year, adding the new name each

If you are very tournament con-
scious in your club, post all players’
names and scores, in the location where
the tournaments take place, to heighten
interest. “Seeing is believing” may be
an old cliché but it is at times very ap-
propriate.

Another important means of expres-
sing the club’s interest in the men is
through taking special notice of birth-
days. Birthday books, charts, or one
large card for the men to sign, are all
interest-getters.

These are merely a few of the many
“gimmicks” which can induce conver-
sation and mutual interest. The loca-
tion, area, available facilities and tem-
perament of patrons are all factors that
determine the various types that will
click in each individual club and the
most feasible methods of promoting
them; however, some type of conver-
sation piece can always be formulated.

Communities throughout the country develop ways to
make Halloween a gala, instead of a grim, occasion.

OST of the people who annually mass around the city square on the night

October thirty-first in Bloomington, Indiana, and jubilantly give vent to t]
spirit of their Halloween party probably never think twice about anything but tl
good time they are having.

Yet, there are a few among these thousands who remember earlier days Wllf
there was no annual Halloween party. They remember when Halloween was ju
a long, tiresome night filled with the antics of over-active pranksters and their on
raged victims. A night when there was wholesale destruction of public and p1
vate property, and juvenile delinquency reached its peak.

But most of them like to think of the new Halloween—the night of the comm-
nity Halloween party. The night when the kids get a chance to let off some I
their excess energy in harmless fun. The night when costumed ghosts, devils, a1
heroes wander around the streets scaring each other to their hearts content. T]
night when every family has a chance to attend a Halloween party with costume
games, and refreshments. The night when a community can get together
friendliness and fellowship.

It is also a night when recreation leaders get a chance to put into practice son
of their ideas and theories concerning cooperative community projects, partie
and worthwhile extra-curricula activities. It is a night for all leaders to lend the
talents to ensure a good time for everyone—RAYMOND REASON, JR.

It is a night which is typical of the new Hallowecn in cities and tom

throughout the nation.

The slogan used in invitations and
publicity for Halloween events was:
“The municipal playground nearest
your home is the place to be seen on
Halloween.” Pre-holiday activities con-
sisted of parties, masquerade dances
and other social events, “bees” for dec-
orating playground clubhouses, and
sessions during which youngsters made
decorations for home and playground
parties. (Los Angeles, California)

Participation at community Hallo-
ween functions was increased by more
widespread publicity through the dis-
tribution of handbills which were pre-
pared by the coordinating council and
sent to the homes of all school children.
(Burbank, California)

In a citywide contest, club room dec-
orations at playgrounds and commu-
nity centers were judged and points
were awarded on: (1) number of
rooms decorated, (2) number of par-
ticipants, (3) originality, (4) artwork

and design, and (5) neatness. (St.-

rerformed around a huge bonfire, an

burning of the “evil spirit.” (Butler,
Pennsylvania)

“Block parties” were held through-
out the community for all kindergarten
and pre-school children, who were in-
vited to attend the party given in the
block in which they lived. Each party,
supervised by selected parent-volunteers
from the block, consisted of games, a
costume contest, and refreshments.

For the six-to-twelve-year-olds there
was a nighttime Halloween Hunt held
on a lighted softball field. Packages of
candy with numbers in them were hid-
den, and a prize was awarded to the
child finding the lucky package. One
rule of the hunt was that children had
to be in costume to participate.

A hayride to a nearby park where
the group participated in singing, danc-
ing and refreshments was one event for
teen-agers. (Greenbelt, Maryland)

An ancient oriental fete—~threii Feast
of Lanterns—was the theme of a
unique and colorful Halloween carni-
val and parade. (One of the publicity
methods used for the event was a series
of visits to schools to tell the children
about the celebrations, as held in Japan
and China, and to explain the plans for
the local festivities.) Costumed parad-
ers, carrying lighted lanterns, made
a striking spectacle as they promenaded
in spiral formations and other grand
march figures in the darkened gymna-
sium of the community center. (Dal-
ton, Massachusetts)

scene of a successful open house for the
whole community. The program start-

energetic, bridge tables were set up in

 

the library. The refreshment commit-
tee came through with doughnuts and
cider, apples, and huge quantities of
homemade cake and cookies. (Man-
hasset, Long Island, New York)

Following the annual costume and
float parade, a mammouth barbeque—
with food donated by local organiza-
tions and cooked by volunteers—set
the mood for a session of community
singing until the children went off to
see a free movie and the teen-agers and
adults adjourned to acommunity-house
dance. (Birmingham, Michigan)

There were many Heats depicting
well-known childhood stories and nurs-
ery rhymes. After the parade, these
floats were parked in an open area and
a storyteller on each one related the
tale that the float represented. (Bridge-
port, Connecticut)

Categories used in udging costumes
in the annual parade were (1) best
comic, (2).most beautiful, (3) most
original, (4-) most representative com-
ic newspaper character, (5) best clown

and then went to the home of the child
whose name was on thc slip—if the
child was at home he received a prize.

Post-parade activities included a
cake-walk contest, exhibition dances,
and a corn husking bee, followed by
street dancing for all. (Phoenixville,

A “black cat contest” was held with
prizes for the children bringing the

DANCING has top billing along with

league sports in the public recrea-
tion program in Portland, Oregon. An-
alysis of attendance records and popu-
lar demand have justified that rating in
the over-all plan of leisure time activi-
ties provided for the public by the de-
partment.

Dancing is scheduled not only at the

ing on a full-time basis, but at a num-
ber of schools where the Bureau of

and social dancing are included gener-
ously in the recreation fare for pre-

girls and boys.

Even among the older adults dancing
is a favorite pastime. Each of the gold—

The square and folk dances, taken ‘

the neighbors turn out in amazing

stimulation and sociability such cor

Any square dance leader will vout
for the effectiveness of square danc:
as niixers. The dance instructors hax
found them a means, too, of overcon
ing the self-consciousness that is cha
acteristic of most young boys whe
they first make their appearance c
dance floors. It is as true for girls an
boys as it is for older adults that squal
dancing is a group rather than an i1
dividual experience, and seemingly
is easier to perform in a group the
alone, especially for the novice.

dancing as a creative, cultural, or just
plain entertainment skill in those who
show verve for entertaining.

The pageants, recitals and festival
events are fourfold in purpose and ac-
complishment. (1) They stimulate in-
terest of the pupils to work toward the
perfection dcmanded for public ap-
pearance. They are grand finale to the
season’s instruction, and contribute
glamor to the work of learning. (2)
They aflord the instructors a panoram-
ic picture of the effectiveness or lack of
effectiveness of teaching methods. (3)
There is educational value to such pro-
ductions. They are means of develop-
ing an appreciation of dancing as a
creative and artistic art form. (4) Also,
such. staged events are an opportunity

' for the park bureau to present to the

public, in dressed up form, a review of
what the municipality offers, and what
dance classes offer and accomplish.
We like dancing in Portland—for
what it does for us physically, for what
it contributes to good spirits, to our

mental processes—and just because
it’s fun!

UNITED NATIIINS DAY

October 24, 1953

 

oUnited Nations Day is the birthday of the United Na-
tions, man’s strongest hope for peace. October 24, 1945 was
the historic day on which the United Nations officially came
into being, the day on which the UN Charter was ratified by
a majority of the then fifty-one participating countries. The
U.S. became a member of the UN after an overwhelming
89-2 vote by the U.S. Senate on August 3, 1945. Today
there are sixty member nations in the UN with twenty other
countries seeking admittance.

In 1947 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution
sponsored by the U.S. which declared “that October 24th
shall henceforth be 0§icially called ‘United Nations Day”
and shall be devoted to making known to the people 'of the
world the aims and achievements of the United Nations and
to gaining their support for the work of the United Na-
tions.”

This international action established a day of world-wide
observance for peace for the first time in history.

In 1948 the U.S. Government set up the United States
Committee for United Nations Day (formerly known as the
National Citizens’ Committee for United Nations Day) to
promote observance of that day in this country.

The UN gives nations the opportunity to plan together for
the good of all—an opportunity to understand and work out
common problems and to resolve differences. The UN must,
if it is to achieve peace and stability for the world, get its
strength from the people themselves.

Plan Your Objectives and Know Your Community

REMEMBER that UN Day falls on a Saturday. Weekend

programs taking in Friday and Sunday or all of UN Week
should be planned so that all groups can participate.

The first step is to analyze your community to determine:
What Type of a Community You Live In. Is there a large
segment of naturalized citizens or is it largely composed of
second and third generation Americans? Is the community
highly organized?

What are Their Interests? What recreational and social ac-

242

tivities are most p0pular? Can you tie in with establis]
or basic interests?

What Information and Misinformation about the UN
Prevalent? Are there well known sources where author
tive information about the UN may be obtained? Are th
individuals with international relations eXperience?
What Opinions in General do the People Have About
UN .9 Are people favorable, apathetic, or opposed?

What Approaches Have Brought Results in other C:

paigns? How may people be reached? Would UN par
be appealing?
Activities

A UN Birthday Party W ith-A-Purpose is probably
most popular way to get close to common basic intere

lead a discussion. But everyone can attend or give a 1
Birthday Party. UN parties provide opportunities for:
while learning and at the same time demonstrate a we
neighborliness essential to strengthening the UN.

There can be big parties and little parties, from city-w
festivals to club, school or neighborhood meetings. But
UN Birthday Parties should have a purpose: (1) to le:
about the UN, what it is, what it’s done, what it can (
(2) to entertain foreign visitors and learn about people
other countries; (3) to exchange messages or gifts w
pe0ple in other UN countries. Some parties can do all thr

Community-Wide Parties 0r Festivals will provide a p
ular focus for involving large numbers of people. Folk 1
tivals vividly demonstrate the idea that people of all 131
are not so different from one another, and that the U
is really a melting pot of nationalities. Nothing reac]
more directly to the roots of a pe0ple than their food, son
music, dances, legends and arts of all kinds. Use the co
munity center, school gymnasium, the town hall, governo
mansion or armory, and solicit the cboperation of local a
state officials.

Such large scale programs can take on one or many
pects: A Festival of Nations featuring costumes, music a
dancing; games of different nations; a Smorgasbord of 1‘
tions featuring foods of different countries; a pageant whi
will dramatize the UN; a folk festival or a UN Birthd
Party which features guests, programs and displays.

Last year a highly successful Supper Party of Natic
was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with a Parade
Breads of Nations as the highlight. Loaves of bread Wt
baked and later sold at UN Birthday Parties all over 1
state and proceeds went to several UN voluntary rel
agencies.

In Vienna, Virginia, A Night in Vienna was held, hon
ing Austrian guests; and collections of food and cloth'
were sent to Vienna, Austria, as a demonstration of frie
ship.

Put the accent on fun, but be sure that the UN and its
complishments are brought into the fun in an informat
way.

Send to U.S. Committee for United Nations Day, 5
21st Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., for aids which

help you organize a community program.

his timely volume is designed,
and foremost, for the increasing

Ilily leaders who have the respon-

is and community groups. Errone-

typical examples of well functioning
recreation centers and programs, pro-
vides much useful information on
workable procedures. The comprehen-
sive bibliography reveals rich re-
sources of additional material on the
various phases of the over-all problems
of recreation for the older citizen.

In addition to presenting the how of
planning suitable recreation and group
work activities for the older citizens,
this ready reference guide performs an-
other valuable service. It tells why
such leisure-time community service is
vital today. Fortunately the American
public is adopting a belated but chal-
lenging concept of the coming role of
our senior citizens in the current social
order. This book should help all of us,
irrespective of age, “to know him bet-
ter as a human being, an individual still
with hopes and aspirations, creative ca-
pabilities, and with a contribution
which he can still make and wants to
make to society.”

A resource volume so definitely
geared to realistic problems of recrea-
tion for America’s senior citizens will
appeal especially to recreation leaders,
group workers, educators and religious
leaders. Much of its content will like-
wise be found helpful by welfare work-
ers, doctors, psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, labor leaders, industrialists and
gerontologists, all of whom attest to the
values of recreation—Charles E.

reation Association.

Leisure Activities of Youth in
Berkeley, California

Davis McEntire. Berkeley Council

of Social Welfare, City Hall, Berkeley
4, California. Pp. 53. $1.25.

This study, made six months ago, is
so thought-provoking that it would not
be fair not to call it to the attention of
those readers who look and think be-
yond the circle of their immediate jobs.
A careful study of the findings of this
objective survey should make all of us
in public and private recreation work

stop and take a careful look at our pro-
grams. How well are we serving
youth?

Why, in a city blessed by an unusu-
ally good location, climate, public
spirit, civic pride, excellent facilities
and leadership, do 34 per cent of the
youth never attend a park, playground
or recreation center? Why do 40 per
cent of the junior high school girls
never attend, while only 15.6 per cent
of the boys never attend? Why does
this figure jump to 57.1 per cent in the
case of senior high school girls, and to
26.9 per cent of senior high school
boys? If this is so in Berkeley, what
would the percentages be in less fortu-
nate cities? What is the reason? Have
we geared our programs too much to
lower age groups? To lower income
groups? Do we fail to please the girls
by our choice of activities? What
should we do about it?

Such questions will arise in every
page of this survey. They’re good
questions, too—important to ponder
over, to discuss in stafir and board meet-
ings, and to try to solve in our program
planning.

Another very valuable and informa-
tive part of this survey includes the
leisure activities of various ethnic
groups—Negroes, orientals and youth
of Mexican parentage. The variance in
their pattern of activities should be
very instructive and provocative to
leaders of such groups, or those who
work in communities that include such
groups.

If you read this report, don’t read it
casually. Analyze the figures, compare
them, study the charts, study the recom-
mendations, and try to interpret the
study in terms of your work and your
community. It’s well-worth doing!—

0200 HOURS I Suddenly the pre-dawn blackness

on Hill 420 split into crashing geysers of flame.
Yelling, firing, hurling grenades, a horde of Beds -
pushed up the hill toward G Company.

A hot fire fight began, lasting several hours.
Finally, suffering heavy casualties, C Company
began to withdraw. Corporal Hernandez stayed,
throwing grenades and firing his remaining
rounds.

Then his M-l jammed. Fixing his bayonet, he
leaped out of his foxhole and disappeared in the
darkness toward the attacking Reds. They found
him in the morning, wounded, ringed with enemy
dead. But he had stopped the attack—alone.

“A man couldn’t fight at all,” says Corporal
Hernandez, “if he weren’t fighting for good
thingsmpeace, and a job, and a chance in the
world. That’s why I’m thankful to the peOple
who’ve put so many billions into Defense Bonds.
For I believe Bonds are a stockpile of prosperity
for our country. A guarantee to men like me that
