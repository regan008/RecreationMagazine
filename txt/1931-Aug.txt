Land

Land—-—once the cheapest thing in the world. Now in spots worth
one million dollars an acre. And you cannot measure in millions or
billions what land, open space, sunshine, parks and playgrounds
mean to children.

Take man away from the soil—give him no touch with the earth,
with nature, and man begins to deteriorate. And it is worse for the
child. Children cannot be real children without access to land that
is really theirs. The humanlra‘ce must ever keep one foot on the land.

Now is the time to set aside in perpetuity our parks, our play-
grounds, our picnic grounds in the country, our swimming places,
our skating ponds, our mountains, our forests that should forever
and always belong to all the people. Each year’s delay makes the
difliculties and the cost greater.

Our great paintings we put in our public art galleries that all may
enjoy them. The choicest and most beautiful land should belong
forever to all the people as their playground set aside to building
up the lives of men. ' “

Business is only a means toward living. Choose first as we build
and rebuild our cities the land the children need and let business and
industry take the best that is left. Business thrives better in the city
that is planned for living.

And yet from the point of view of business, more money is made
—say all the best business men-~_—when land is'saved for parks, play-
grounds and open spaces, bedause in this case the nine-tenths remain-
ing is worth more  the ten-tenths.

pared by the late
William E. Harmon
of New York, one of
the largest develop-
ers of vacant land in
the United States.
It was the belief of

Mr. Harmon that
recreation areas in real estate subdivisions had

both a community and a business value.

But even before the recreation movement came
into being, we find evidence of real estate de-
velopers setting aside a certain part of their land
holding for parks. One of the most notable of
these is Gramercy Park in New York City, orig-
inally established as a part of what would now
be termed a subdivision. One hundred years ago
Samuel Ruggles purchased Gramercy Farm and
a tract of land called Bowery Hill and subdivided
it into 108 lots, 42 of which he set aside as a
private park, the 66 surrounding lots being sold
for residence purposes. Ownership of the resi-
dence lots carried with it a proportionate owner-
ship in the park area. The management was
vested in live trustees, and the expense of main-
tenance of the park has ever since been met by
assessment upon the property owners having an
equity in the park.

Growth of the Movement

It is only in the past few years, however, that
the plan of setting aside recreation areas, has
assumed the proportions of a national movement.
It was through the generous support of the Har-

mon Foundation that the National Recreation;

Association over three years ago was enabled to
give the services of one of its field secretaries to
promote this project. Personal visits have been
made to 123 cities with a pOpulation of over
50,000, and to 90 cities of less than 50,000
inhabitants. Today the National Recreation As-
sociation has records of 527 subdivisions in which
recreation areas have been set aside, located in
258 different cities.

In order to focus the attention of the real estate
developers upon the idea of recreation areas in
real estate subdivisions, the National Recreation
Association circulated a statement called “Rec—
recreation Fundamentals in Real Estate Develop-
ment.” It emphasized the opportunity of real

' estate men to contribute to the safety, health and

happiness of the community by setting aside a
portion of their subdivision for recreation. The
statement has been endorsed by 1,436 presidents,
vice-presidents, secretaries and members of real
estate boards,-numerous city planners, landscape
architects, Legionnaires, and other persons.
Many real estate developers who have included
recreation areas in their subdivisions have written
encouraging testimonials as to the value of such
areas.

Why Set Aside Recreation Areas in Real
Estate Subdivisions?

Public interest in recreation during the past
decade has been increasing by leaps and bounds.
There is every indication that the hours of work
per day and per week are to be further reduced.
Man is going to have more free time in the future.
and every opportunity must be given him to
utilize this leisure in the best possible manner.
Tramc hazards today are great; the number of
automobile fatalities is on the increase. \Vitness
the 10,000 children under the age of fifteen years
who were killed during a recent eighteen months’
period. Children must be given safe places in
which to play.

There is evidence to show that where young
people are denied their natural play priviliges
in parks and playgrounds very frequently they
take the form of gangs and lead to the destruction
of property and' to delinquency. Playgrounds
help keep children out of juvenile courts. It is
the testimony of probation officers and judges that
delinquency in large cities increases in direct pro-
portion to the distance from playgrounds.

° . In any consideration of the use of leisure time

THE WHY OF RECREATION AREAS 257

the problem of places to play is of paramount im—
portance, and land assumes great social value.
The population of our American cities has been
rapidly increasing and space in practically all of
them is at a premium. New playgrounds and
parks for congested areas are obtained only at
exorbitant figures. Additional recreation areas
need to be secured now; tomorrow it will be too
late.

Little consideration has been given in the past-
in nearly all of our cities to the question of space
for parks and playgrounds. Our city planning
has been haphazard with noticeable deficiencies in
Open spaces in the congested areas. It is out on
the periphery of our large cities that we are forced
to go for space for our playgrounds and parks,
which is a way of solving this problem in the
future._ Land should be secured while it is still
cheap and available.

The key to the problem of the provision of ade-
quate space for play lies to a large degree in the
hands of the real estate subdivider who develops
large as well as small tracts of land. The prob-
lem will not be solved, however, by the setting
aside of recreation areas now with the intention
of cutting them up for lots later and selling them
to the public. The dedication of lands for parks
and playgrounds should be a permanent affair
which will insure these open spaces for all time.

Practically all rapidly growing cities in the
United States during the past decade have been
over-subdivided. Such cities as Los Angeles,
Chicago, Detroit, and New York are examples
of this, as is the State of Florida which 'suf-
fered so greatly during the late land infiation.
Thousands of subdividers who planned develop-
ments of the old stereotyped method of gridiron
streets with no open spaces, have gone out of
business. The wrecks of
what were once over-adver-
tised subdivisions can be
seen in all parts of the land.
Only those which have been
planned wisely and well
survive the wreckage.
These as a result have been
well spotted, having been
located in the path of the
city’s progress and have in—
cluded open spaces where
the citizens of the com—
munity may find opportu-
nities for recreation. Real

Adequate recreation space is today an
economic necessity in every
Furthermore, the subdivider of today has
learned that it is wise to set aside land for
playgrounds in his communities in the same
way that he allots certain areas for streets. . . .
The subdivider benefits markedly from the
higher prices and quicker sales which result
in new communities supplied with adequate
playgrounds, parks, athletic fields, tennis
courts, or golf courses. The benefits which
accrue to the public from permanent provi-
sion for its recreational needs are no less

estate men may draw a lesson from the ungainful
method of subdividing land as evidenced by the
hundreds of lamentable failures which are to be
found on every hand. Some of the most experi-
enced real estate developers believe that the solu-
tion of this problem lies in the revamping and
replatting of well chosen sites and the inclusion
of sufficient recreation areas in them. This would
no doubt lead to a renewed interest in them by

the public who .is interested in homes in livable
neighborhoods. ;

Dollars and Cents Values

There is plenty of evidence to show that real
estate subdividers are finding it pays in terms of
dollars and cents to make their property more
attractive to possible purchasers by providing
space for play and beautiful open areas.

“Convenience and accessibility to sports and
recreational centers,” says Mr. George Koch of
the Cord Meyer Development Company, Forest
Hills, Long Island, “are strong contributing fac-
tors to the making of a successful suburban com—
munity. The chief reason for the average man’s
decision to leave the city with its attendant noise,
crowded conditions, and complex transportation
problems is his desire to provide for himself and
his family more of the outdoor life with its mani-
fold advantages to health and pleasure, and the
builder or developer who takes into consideration
these very important facts, and builds in a section
where facilities for tennis, golf, etc., exist or are
in the making, is assured of a continuing demand
for his product.”*

Families are naturally ’more interested in mak-
ing their homes in livable neighborhoods offering
beauty and out-of—door space for games and rec-
reation and safety for their children. Increas-
ingly real estate firms are giving more and more
space in their newspaper
advertising to the recrea-
tional opportunities which
their subdivisions have to
offer to the general public.
A perusal of real estate ad-
vertisements in the Sunday
newspapers will bear out
this statement.

of setting aside well plan-
ned recreation areas in sub-
divisions is to be found in

*New York Times, June 21, 1931

258 THE WHY OF RECREATION AREAS

such splendid communities as Forest Hills, Long
Island, the country club district of Kansas City,
Roland Park bf Baltimore and many others. In
an article entitled “Neighborhoods That Can’t Be
Spoiled” in the July, 1931, Survey Graphic,
Marc N. Goodnow says: “The experience of the
developers of these projects has been of the kind
that could be adopted no doubt with great benefit
by real estate subdividers and city planners else—
where. For since profits generally can only be
taken from such projects after the first half or
first three-quarters of the property has been sold,
whatever measures the subdivider takes to pro-
tect the remaining portion of the tract are re-
turned to him in multiple form.”

The Values to the Community of Setting
Aside Recreation Areas

The well planned community with adequate rec-
reation areas under competent leadership, is apt to
develop a finer community spirit, thus making it
more livable for all concerned. It is not enough
for the realtor simply to make an outright dona-
tion of land with no further thought. The site
much be well chosen, it must fit in with the city
plan, and must be a well administered recreation
area. There is too much at stake for any one to
give minor consideration to this important prob-
lem of recreation. As life is constituted today
the provision of recreation is one of our major
problems, involving as it does the health and
moral growth of the peOple.

It has sometimes been stated rather errone-
ously by ofiicials that playgrounds depreciate the
value of land which adjoins them. The careful
statistical studies made by authorities disapprove
of that idea. The conclusion made by Charles
J. Storey of the Department of Recreation of the
Russell Sage Foundation of nine playgrounds in
New York City shows that:

There have been no decreases in land values on
the blocks bordering the playgrounds after the
acquisition of the playgrounds, but rather a steady
increase has taken place.

Large plots well cared for, such as Betsy Head
Playground, when in a wholly residential district
increase the value of the bordering property in
somewhat the same manner as parks do.

Small plots used as playgrounds when sur-
rounded by business and industry appear to have
little effect one way or the other on surrounding
values.

Where playgrounds are now in the midst of
mixed residential, business and industrial blocks,

as Chelsea and St. Gabriel’s, there is not the same
rate of increase in land values on bordering streets
as on streets adjacent. This is probably because
the increased commercial use of the land tends
to overshadow any benefits derived from the play-
grounds to the residents.

Where the neighborhood is wholly residential
in character the average increase of land values
around the playground has been far greater than
in other districts where business and industry are
present.

When business and industry extend into blocks
bordering on or adjacent to a playground, the
benefits of the playground to the neighborhood as
refiected in the land values are very much de-
creased.

In order to obtain the full and continued bene-
fits froni playgrounds as from parks, all sides of
them should be zoned for residential purposes
only.

The recent original study* made by Charles
Herrick, Assistant Engineer of the City Plan
Commission, Bayonne, New Jersey. of the rela-
tionship between the amount of park space in a
city and the total assessed value of real estate for
85 large cities, throws some new light on the sub—
ject. Mr. Herrick has worked out some formulas
that prove in a very definite way that parks have
a very decided effect in increasing land values in
not only their immediate vicinity but also over
large areas. Density of population, he found, was
a strong contributory factor.

To the real estate subdivider has increasingly
come the realization that by the wise platting of
his land and by including adequate recreation
areas he can build a monument that will everlast-
ineg stand to his credit. Of what avail is it for
him to erect house crowded upon house whose
number is legion if the people living in them are
denied, through his selfish interests the open
spaces where they may give expression of their
natural desires for recreation and play? The
hundreds of fine subdivisions which now (lot our
land which have included adequate recreation
areas are evidence of the trend on the part of
real estate developers to build communities that
are more livable and which will surely produce a
fine type of citizen.

As Harland Bartholomew, an outstanding city
planner, has so well said: “Parks and playgrounds
are fully as essential to the upbuilding of a city

Where there is no city plan, subdividers may
confer with some city planner and the park and

that the proposed space nts in with the commu—
nity scheme of recreational facilities. Especially
is such consultation necessary if the realtor plans

will clear the way to' city
acceptance because it in-
sures" a scientific layout
and equipment of the
play site, the consequent
approval of park authori-
ties, and their willing-
ness to provide leader-
ship.

The City Planning
Primer also makes the
following statement re-
garding the control of
new subdivisions:

“The control of the
layout of new subdivi-
sions is a vital part of
the day to day adminis-
tration of planning.
Without adequate con-
trol worse mistakes are
apt to be made in new
subdivisions than were
made in the center of a
city, for new streets in
outlyin g districts are
usually not a matter of
public attention until
some time after a mis-
take has been made and
when changes are diffi-
cult to make. Developers of new subdivisions
usually are glad to conform to a good plan,
but in some instances both tact and resource-
fulness may be required on the part of the
city authorities to make sure that the street
layout does not interfere with the major thor-
oughfare plan and that enough and proper land
for parks and playgrounds is set aside. Support-
ing citizens’ organizations are frequently most
helpful in securing voluntary adherence to the
plan. The main trouble in most cases in the past
has been the lack of a comprehensive plan and
the consequent handicap upon both city authorities
and enlightened private subdividers in connection
with opening up new subdivisions.”

It is evident that as the study of subdivision
control has progressed that the technical city
planner has become considerate of the practical
result of subdivision control, and the realtor has
become interested in the technical phase of city
planning and recognizes the valuable results of

such planning on land investments and land
sales.

Types of R‘égreation
Areas in Sub-
divisions -

A study of some
six hundred subdivisions
throughout the country
show that there are
roughly three standard
types of recreation areas.
One is to be found in
the large subdivisions of
one hundred or more
acres, and includes golf
links, bridle paths, swim-

' ming pools, and other
facilities. Another type
is located in the smaller
subdivisions and includes
children’s playgrounds
with the necessary appa-
ratus. The third is to be
found in the small mul-
tiple dwelling subdivi-
sions which include in-
terior block playgrounds
for the small children
below the age of seven
years.

T he subdivider of
large tracts can be more
generous with his gift of
land than can the real estate developer with
smaller holdings. There. is usually a tendency
with him, however, to cater to the desires of the
adults. Golf links which have a good sales value
usually take up most of the recreation space. He
is apt to overlook the needs of children below the

age of fifteen years.

The possessor of smaller tracts of land is forced
to limit himself to the setting aside of playing
fields and playgrounds. These take care of the
younger pe0p1e but exclude the adults. Besides
these play facilities for the children there should
also be provision made for the adults. Tennis
courts, quoit pitches, hand ball, volley ball courts,
and like facilities do not take up much space and
should be included in every one of the smaller
subdivisions.

The builder of multiple dwellings is forced even
further to restrict himself in this question of
Space for recreation. The area set aside for rec-
reation in the interior block playground serves
the smaller children under the age of seven and
must be restricted to such play facilities as the

the children,

RECREATION AREAS AND THE CITY PLAN 261

swings, slides, and sand boxes. These open spaces
serve also as resting places for the old folks who
desire the passive forms of recreation.

It is the small subdivision which offers the most
difficult problem and which needs the help of city
planners and the local recreation leaders more
than the larger subdivision. N o matter how well
planned a small subdivision is, it cannot protect
its character from adjoining properties, and ulti-
mately a neighborhood or “local community” will
become a patchwork of small subdivisions, each
independently planned and each unrelated to all
the others. It is essential that ways be found to

age of seven. The older boy and girl is apt to
be overlooked and fewer opportunities are given
to them to participate in such team games as
playground ball, baseball, basketball, and volley
ball, all of which demand playing fields.

Amounts Set Aside for Play Space

Ten per cent of the total area in a community
has been the figure agreed upon by authorities as
the minimum amount which should be reserved
for recreation. Much depends, however, upon the
size of the subdivision as it is far easier to set
aside more area in the large subdivision for rec-

determine the general recreation layout of the
whole neighborhood so that each small subdivision
can be recreationally planned to fit in with the
general recreation plan decided upon.

The question of space in the large subdivisions
is often a minor matter, as the homes are built
on plots of one acre or more. When there are
children in the family one frequently finds home
playgrounds for the smaller children under the

 

reation purposes than it is in the small subdivi—
sion. One should take into consideration the sur—
rounding environs as to whether municipal parks,
golf links, playing fields, playgrounds, and bathing
beaches. are accessible.

“In America we have generally accepted five
types of playgrounds. The play lot of which there
should be, if possible, one in every block, is used
mainly for children of preschool age—size, 6,000

square feet. The neigh—
borhood p l ay 9 r o u n all
should consist of six to
ten acres every quarter
mile. The district play—
ground should consist of
about twenty acres in every mile; and there should
be one recreation fieId of not less than thirty acres
for every fifteen thousand inhabitants as well as
a recreation park of not less than seventy—five
acres for every fifty thousand population of a
city.”-—(Ernst Hermann, Health and Physical
Education, June, 1931)

In so far as the subdivider is concerned in de—
ciding how much space should be set aside for
recreation purposes, it would be necessary for
him to estimate the number of people who will
eventually live in the subdivision. The standards
adopted by the Regional Planning Board of Chi-
cago are one acre for one hundred people; or
ten acres for one thousand people, seven acres of
which are for park purposes and three acres for
playground purposes.

The first table on page 263 gives the approxi—
mate space requirements for a number of games
and sports played on children’s playgrounds.

Location of Play Areas

The location of recreation space proposed for
dedication should be carefully considered.as im—
properly located areas cannot be used to the best
advantage by the community.

The efforts of real estate developers in provid—
ing adequate recreation space should necessarily

be with the people who
live in the moderate—cost
and low-cost homes. These
are numbered among the
85 per cent of the salaried
folks who earn less than
$2,000 per year. Comparativer few pe0ple can
afford to buy homes costing $15,000 or more.

The School Site

\V hen the land is subdivided consideration
should first be given to the selection of the school
site. This should be sufliciently large to include
park, playground, and playing field space. It is
this type of recreation area which often proves
to be the most economical, as the school build-
ing can be used during the entire year for bathing.
dressing, toilet, and other purposes.

This is in line with the plan followed by a
number of cities which have effectively grouped
their recreational areas around the school sites
into a sort of School—Park-Playground Unit.
From five to ten acres have been set aside for the
elementary schools; ten acres to fifteen acres for
the junior high school; and fifteen to twenty—five
acres for the senior high school.

Some real estate developers plan their subdivi-
sions so that they either adjoin or are in close
proximity to parks and golf links and similar
areas. They frequently capitalize on this happy
combination of circumstances and give wide ad—
vertising to these recreational facts. In some in—
stances it may solve the recreation problem of
their subdivision. In other instances it serves the

Playgrounds and Playing Fields

Playgrounds should be so located that they are
available to young children within the radius of
a quarter mile. The area selected need not neces-
sarily be flat, but might be located on the side
of a slope or in a wooded area where it is cool
and shady in the summer.

The selection of a site for a playing field is,
however, of more importance. Here the surface
must be Hat so as to permit the playing of the
active team games. They should be so placed that
they will serve the older boys and girls living'
within a radius of one-half to one mile. Where it.
is at all possible they should adjoin the junior or
senior high schools.

Other Facilities

The sites for golf links, bridle paths, and parks
offer another problem which usually lies within
the realm of the landscape architect and the plan-
ning engineer. Each subdivision offers its own:

264 , RECREATION AREAS AND THE CITY PLAN

problem, and the advice of highly technical plan-
ning engineers is essential. For certain types of
parks, particularly the scenic type, rough or
swampy lands, less saleable than the remainder
of the area, may well be set aside. It is frequently
found to be more profitable to the developer to
set aside certain low land for park and golf pur-
poses than it is to attempt to deveIOp it. The cost
for the installation of sewers, etc. would be out
of all proportion to the cost of development.

John Nolen, well-known city planner, has laid
down five principles to guide the selection of rec-
reation areas:

(1) To acquire those easily accessible small
tracts in different parts of the city which may
most cheaply be adapted to serve as local play—
grounds or recreation centers.

(2) To seek also some moderately large tracts,
even though less accessible for the present genera-
tion, provided they are capable of conversion at
relatively small cost into parks which will have
the beauty of natural scenery.

(3) To acquire property for large parks in
advance of general settlement of neighborhood.

(4) To select generally, though not always,
lands which are not well adapted for streets and
buildings. '

(5) To distribute the lands'over the city in
such a way as to give the maximum of use to the

people who will be called upon to pay for their
acquisition, development, and maintenance.

Adequate provision for play and recreation is
dependent in the last analysis upon city planning
and regional planning, and especially in the lay-
ing out of new suburbs and new towns to meet
the requirements of modern life.

Layout and Equipment of Recreation Areas

The real estate developer in laying out and
equipping recreation areas in his subdivision will
find it highly desirable to call for aid upon those
who are experienced in such methods and who are
highly trained technicians. There is plenty of evi—
dence as to recreation areas in real estate subdivi-
sions which have been failures and have been
abandoned because real estate operators, failing to
appreciate the importance of technical knowledge,
have felt they had performed their duty when
they bought playground apparatus from some
company and set it out on any unused land.

In laying out a children’s playground it is ad-
visable to divide the playground into several sec-

tions in order to provide for various age groups
and for special uses. If children of preschool age
are to use the ground, a small section should be
provided for them. A place may be set aside for
boys and girls from five or six years of age to
ten or eleven, and here most of the apparatus
will be placed. Separate areas should be provided
for the boys over eleven years of age and for the
girls of the same age. A shaded area near the
shelter is often set aside for handcraft and quiet
games. Various sections may be separated by
hedges, fences, trees, or paths.

It is almost universally agreed that apparatus
has an important place on the playground, but
there is considerable difference of opinion as to
the relative merits of the various kinds of play-
ground apparatus and many recreation workers
believe only a minimum amount is necessary such
as slides, swings, a sand box, low climbing appar-
atus, horizontal ladder, horizontal bar, giant stride,
traveling rings, balance beam, and possibly see-
saws. In order that playground apparatus may
serve its purpose most effectively, the following
factors must be given consideration—proper loca—
tion, arrangement and erection, regular inspection,
careful supervision, the marking off of apparatus
zonings, care of ground underneath apparatus,
and instruction in its correct use.

A playground should be as attractive and beau-
tiful as possible, and it has been found that beauty
on the playground minimizes disciplinary prob—
lems. Grass plots and shrubs along the borders
and in corners are very desirable. Playgrounds
should have some shade and trees may be planted
along border fences or near the apparatus area.
It should be borne in mind, however, that land-
scaping must not interfere with play areas. Chil-
dren’s gardens may be provided if sufficient space
is available. If it is necessary to have a fence
around the playground—and this is usually an
important f actor—it is well to set the fence a few
feet back from the sidewalk and to plant shrubs
and vines along the border outside the fence.

The playground surfacing should be as even
and smooth as possible—not so hard as to injure
children who may fall and not so soft that the
feet of the children will leave holes in it. Grass
makes the most desirable surfacing but is not
practicable on intensively used play areas. Note:
Detailed information on layout and equipment
may be secured in Play Areas—Their Design and
Equipment (N. R. A. $2.50) and bulletins issued

STRATHMEADE, Fairfax County, Virginia,

represents an unusual layout of a golf course
in a subdivision. The engineer has so woven the
golf links in the development that the maximum
number of homes are exposed to the park lands.
Out of approximately 700 building lots, 350, or
one-half, face the golf links.

 

According to recent studies that have been
made which show that parks have a very decided
effect in increasing land values, not only in their
own vicinity but also over large areas, it would
seem as though this developer were getting the
most out of his subdivision by this method of
platting.

Outstanding Recreation Developments

in Subdivisions

  
 
 
 
    
 

  
 

Provision for dead end streets,
safety walks and underpasses,
has made Radburn known as
the Town for the Motor Age.

N all sections of the country there are recrea-
tion areas which are practical demonstrations
of what is being done by subdividers in de-

veloping the three general types suggested.

In the Large Subdivisions

Of the large subdivisions an outstanding exam-
ple is Forest Hills Gardens, a subdivision in F or-
est Hills, New York, started by the Russell Sage
Foundation in 1911. It consists of about 200
acres, 10 of which have been set aside for recrea-
tion purposes. These include parks, children’s
playgrounds, tennis courts and a large commu-
nity house. The latter has a splendid indoor swim-
ming pool 60’ x 25’. Membership is open to the
community. The dues are fifty dollars a year for
the entire family. The family is required to take
out a one hundred dollar bond, which is later
returned. The method of retiring the bonds is to
have a public gathering once yearly and a draw-
ing for twenty of the bonds. A year round rec-
reation program is conducted by the Executive
Secretary and his staff of workers.

Another of newly planned communities in the
United States is the town of Radburn, which is
rising on an area of 1,000 acres in northern New

Jersey about fifteen miles from New York City.
Eventually, it is believed it will shelter 3. popula-
tion of some 25,000. This town has come into
being as a place where children will be protected
in their play. In Radburn, the “town for the
motor age" the children may go to the school,
the playground and to the store along sheltered
garden paths. The planning affords entire safety
for street trafhc as well as extensive areas for
recreation. Radburn, now in its third year of
existence has proven to be a complete success.

A resident of Radburn writes: “Two years in
Radburn, New Jersey, have demonstrated to our
family its worth as a good town in which to live.
An important factor in Radburn’s success is the
splendid provision of facilities and activities for
well-rounded use of leisure hours. Tennis courts,
swimming pools, playgrounds, club rooms and a
gymnasium are available to all and are enjoyed
by many. Choral groups, dramatic societies, arts
and craft classes have been organized. Every man,

OUTSTANDING RECREATION DEVELOPMENTS 267

woman and child can follow one or many avoca-
tional pursuits. Another asset for Radburn lies
in the fact that in a simple, normal, Wholesome
manner it affords a family an opportunity to have
a place in community life.” '

Mariemont, a new town of Cincinnati, Ohio,
planned by John N olen and Philip Foster, is one
of the most comprehensive real estate develop-
ments in the country. The general plan covers a
tract of 365 acres, of which its inhabitants have
the benefit of fifty acres of parks, playgrounds,
village greens, and a concourse on a two mile
drive. Through the generosity of Mrs. Mary M.
Emery, the projector and sponsor of Mariemont,
the residents enjoy all forms of recreational activi-
ties in the stadium, playgrounds and parks.

Palos Verdes Estates facing the Pacific Ocean,
twenty. miles south of Los Angeles, California and
comprising some 16,000 acres extending twelve
miles along the Pacific Ocean, is the largest single
development yet undertaken in America. Six hun-
dred acres of neighborhood parks, the entire ocean
front for more than four miles, together with
canyons, riding trails, golf courses and other
small parks have been deeded permanently to the
Community Association in which the owner of
every lot has one vote. Maintenance of parks,
streets and golf courses, of fire and police pro-
tection and lighting is provided by an annual tax
or assessment levied by the home’s association on
all lots that have been subdivided and legally filed
of record, including those lots owned by the pro-
ject itself.

The Sleepy Hollow Manor Club in Tarrytown,
New York, is located on the grounds of Sleepy
Hollow Manor overlooking the Hudson River and
on the shores of a private lake. The club prop-
erty consisting of three acres has four tourna-
ment tennis courts, two concrete handball courts,
and an expanse of lawn which provides oppor-
tunities for croquet and other lawn sports. There
is a swimming pool of reinforced concrete con-
struction, 40’ x 100’, which has a force pump fil-
tering system. A wading pool, 12’ x 20’ for chil-
dren, operates on the same filtering system. The
lake covers seven acres and provides a wooded
retreat in the summer. It affords a splendid
opportunity for one to skate, play ice hockey,
curl, and practice other sports in the winter.
Membership in the club makes these privileges
available to all members of the family.

Northwood Hills is the latest subdivision being
developed by the Roland Park Company of Balti-
more, Maryland, one of the first companies to

plan fine subdivisions in the United States.
Northwood Hills is to have its playground for
children and playing fields for the older boys and
girls. An outdoor swimming pool of concrete is
planned for the future.

Nassau Shores, Long Island: a Harmon devel-
opment comprising about 498 acres, has set aside
53.7 acres for recreational purposes. This area in-
cludes a nine hole golf course, club house and
swimming beach. Every lot owner automatically
becomes eligible for membership in the club. A
small fee is charged for the recreation activities.

Charles H. Reis in describing in the National
Real Estate Journal, February 16, 1931, his lat-
est subdivision at Allwood, New Jersey, a
$50,000,000 project, has this to say:

“Not wanting to have our residential areas
about the business section, we decided to set aside
approximately ten acres of ground adjoining the
business section for parks, playgrounds and com-
munity buildings.

“You will notice by the sketch of the play-
ground center that it is Hanked by the business
district on one side and on the other two sides
by the state highway and a country road. Inci-
dentally, you will also notice that we have set
aside the very heart of our property for this com-
munity center. Our reason for doing so is, first,
the attention it now attracts will bring us sales;
and second, it will in the future set Allwood aside
as having a most unusual town center. Every
phase of sport is provided for with a regulation
piece of ground for its use. You will notice the
same locations may be used for different activi-
ties at various seasons of the year without in any
way interfering with the physical conditions of
the ground.”

The large subdivisions mentioned are merely
typical of many of the splendid developments such
as: Mountain Brook Estates in Birmingham;
Cherokee Gardens, Louisville, Kentucky; Wash-
ington Heights, Detroit, Michigan; Russell Gar-
dens, Great Neck, New York; Mariemont, Cin-
cinnati, Ohio; Broadmoor, Seattle, Washington-
ton; St. Francis Wood, San Francisco, California;
Yorkshire Village, Camden, New Jersey; Shak-
ers Heights, Cleveland, Ohio, and a host of others
reported in the chart on page 270.

In the Smaller Subdivisions

There are many examples of the smaller sub-
divisions which include children’s playgrounds and
similar facilities. A number of these incorporate
the interior block playgrounds which characterize

Sunnyside is one of the smal
subdivisions on Long Island
reached by elevated trains in fifteen minutes from
the heart of New York City. It consists of me-
dium-cost homes for people of moderate means.
The area has a population of about 6,000 people.
Two types of playgrounds have been set aside in
this area; the interior block. and the typical city

hand ball, volley, and basketball courts; quoit
pitches: and children’s playground apparatus and
sand boxes. An association of property holders
control and direct the recreational activities of the
playground. A nominal fee of one dollar a month
is charged to families living in the Sunnyside area.
The playground is under the leadership of a well-
trained recreation director.

The townsite of \Voodmar* located on the
southern edge of Hammond, Indiana, comprises
some 650 acres. It has a private golf course and
a park along the Little Calumet River. Certain
blocks were reserved for schools and playground
sites. A certain number of blocks were so planned
as to contain interior playgrounds and parks. The
two long parkway strips vary in width from 150
to 250 feet. At each side of the parkway strip is
a narrow lane giving access to the lots lying along
the park.

They are
divided into two sections; one of
which is enclosed by a fence and
planted and to be used by small children and
mothers. The other is for the older children. It
was considered necessary for various reasons to
place service ways or alleys inside the blocks. The
smaller children’s playground is fenced off from
this service way which encircles it, but in the case
of the larger children the plan is for them to use
it as part of the play area. \Vhile it would be
better to have no interior alley as far as the chil-
dren are concerned, it was felt that the arrange-
ment as described would be far superior to hav-
ing the children playing or running out into the
regular trafiic streets. This plan is an adaptation
of the idea of taking advantage of otherwise
wasted land at the rear ends of blocks, and is
used only where other kinds of playgrounds are
not immediately accessible and where lots are
small and population will be heavy.

The idea is to have the houses face inward with
their service parts towards the street. These in-
terior blocks are laid out along the parkway strips
so that they would not damage the property look-
ing across the street to the service parts of the
interior blocks. They afford a safe place for the
children to play.

No residential lot in \Voodmar is more than
1,000 feet from a park, playground or golf course.

OUTSTANDING RECREATION DEVELOPMENTS 269

Southside Place, a development of E. L. Crain
of Houston, Texas, has in its very core a well
equipped playground, 300' x 330'. Here is to be
found apparatus for children, sand boxes, slides,
swings, etc., playground ball diamonds, basket and
volley ball courts, a concrete swimming pool, and
a field house. The grounds have been well planted
with shrubs and is a beauty spot in the commu-
nity. The land has been deeded to the city and
is maintained and supervised by the latter.

Mr. Crain in speaking about the work of the
field secretary on service to real estate subdivi-
sions, National Recreation Association, has
written: “I commend you and your association
very highly for the type of work that you are
doing, and I fully realize that it will be impos-
sible, probably for years to come, for some of our
citizens to understand the benefits to be derived
by an 'entire citizenship along this line, but in
time to come, after a careful analysis, they will
fully realize its many benefits.”

Greenway Park is a rather unique subdivision
lying on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas. It is fash-
ioned somewhat on the plan of the Garden Homes
of England. All homes in the deve10pment face
on a park. Every facility is offered to the chil—
dren for play, and to the adults for the more pas-
sive forms of recreation.

Monticello, a subdivision of 125 acres, situated
on the outskirts of Fort Worth, has its fine
park-playground of 4.5 acres. This has also been
deeded to the city and is maintained and super-
vised by the municipality. Mr. W. C. Guthrie,
the Secretary-Treasurer of the Monticello Land
Company, has said: “It affords
me much pleasure to call your
attention to the inestiniable

and other facilities.

Mr. Edgar C. Allen, the president, describes
the Edgebrook Golf Club as follows:

“The recreation is controlled by the Edgebrook
Golf Club, a corporation not for profit, of which
property owners are members. Membership is
given into this club on purchase of property. The
recreation feature is controlled entirely by the
property owners; that is, the president, secretary
and treasurer, and board of directors, are prop-
erty owners, and assess their members the same
as any golf club. The assessment to maintain this
course, from experience, will average $30 per
year per member. The assessment, of $30 of
course, includes the use of the course by the fami-
lies of the members and their guests without
further charge. This assessment will also take
care of the swimming, etc. The title to the park
is in trust for the property owners, and the Edge-
brook Golf Club has control of the operation of
this trust. For financial reasons the Edgebrook
Company carry the difference between 150 mem-
bers and the present property owners. In other
words, at the present there are seventy-two mem-
bers in the club and the Edgebrook Company
stands an assessment of the difference between
150 and seventy-two members. In this way the
club is put on an operating basis. The entire
cost for this recreation feature was borne by the
Edgebrook Company, equipment being purchased
to care for same before deeding property for the
use of the lot owners. The
land covered by the park aver-
aged about $700 per acre. The

Of 254 subdivisions showing complete records and which total 180,444.60 acres, 11,543.33 acres

43 “ “ are maintained by property holders
13 “ “ it is proposed to donate to the city

8 “ “ are held in trust

Control and Financing

of

Recreation Areas in Subdivisions

If land is to be held permanently for
recreation purposes, the problem of
control must be carefully considered

subdividers who have set aside recreation
areas in subdivisions that are within the
city limits is to turn them over to the city gov-

THE prevailing tendency of real estate

ernment, through ,the Park Board or other de-
partment, for control and maintenance. It re-
lieves them of the necessity for continued care
and assures supervision of the area, and does
away with the paying of taxes on the recreation
area, either by the company or the home owners.

An alternative tried by some companies has
been the vesting of the title to the recreation
areas in an association of home owners. A levy
is made on the home owners for the purpose of
developing and maintaining the areas. Sometimes
this cost is met by membership
fees or special assessments.
Eventually the home owners’
association may turn the prop-
erty over to the city, if they
so desire.

A swimming pool is provided in
South Side Place, the develop-
ment of the Crain Ready

House Company, Houston,

A few real estate companies have retained the
title to the recreation areas temporarily, intend-
ing later to deed the spaces to the city or to the
property owners. This has been true especially
when subdivisions lie outside the city boundaries
and the playground gift cannot yet be legally
accepted by the city. To insure that the space set
aside shall be devoted to recreation, most com-
panies have specifically dedicated the land in per-
petuity for recreation purposes. In only a few
instances have promoters used
recreation space as a bait to lure
buyers and later have cut up that

will be held permantntly tor recr *ation pur-
poses is an unportant one. Mr. Edward M.
Ilassett, in charge of the Legal Division, Regional
Plan of Yew Xork and Its Environs, has called
attention to the difference there is in our American
cities between playgrounds which are part of park
systems and playgrounds which are under the
board of education. I .and acquired by park de-
partments for park, playground and recreation
purposes is so dedicated when acquired that such
land cannot be alienated in a large number of cities
except by special acts of the state
legislatures. Land acquired by
school boards for new school build—
ings is not ordinarily permanently
dedicated. and there is nothing to
prevent school boards from building
on spaces originally intended for
play and recreation purposes or
from selling the areas. In dedicat-
ing land to the municipality it is
important for subdividers to keep in
mind any legal restrictions involved.

Municipalities sometimes hesitate
to accept raw recreation space. espe-
cially when there are few tax pay-
ers in the neighborhood. They are
not so reluctant to accept it once it
has been developed and beautihed.
This was demonstrated in a number
of instances of real estate developers
who had received the Harmon
Award in 1928. The subdivider in
this instance. gave the land, and the
Harmon Foundation mad 0 the
money award to develop and beau-
tify the playground.

Experience has shown that it
pays subdividers to develop and
beautify the land themselves if they
are unable to persuade the city to
accept it in the raw state. It is, of
course, implied that the recreation
area is the kind of gift which places
no excessive burden on the tax-
payers and is really needed.

Recreation workers and officials
are naturally eager to see recreation

areas increased and their cooperation should al-
ways be secured. They may often be in a position
to help if difficulties should arise in getting the
municipality to accept gifts of land for recreation
purposes.

The Los Angeles Playground and Recreation
Department passed the following resolution urg-
ing all owners of new subdivisions to set aside
areas for playgrounds in tracts being placed on
the market to obviate the costly condemnation
proceedings for. such grounds in the future.

“Whereas, public playgrounds equipped for
the play of children and made attractive as a
community gathering place for people of all
ages have come to be recognized as 'a vital
necessity in every residential district in urban
communities, and

“Whereas, suitable areas for playground pur-
poses should be set aside in every residential
tract, when the same is laid out, in the same
manner as land for streets and easements for
public utilities is provided when residential
tracts are subdivided. thus making expensive
condemnation therefor unnecessary at a later
date, and

“Whereas, experience has shown that pub-
lic playgrounds properly improved and oper—

tract more desirable as a place of residence,

“Now, therefore, be it resolved that the
Board of Playground and Recreation Commis-

dividers of residential tracts to set aside in the
original subdivision maps, such areas as will be
suitable to serve play and recreation needs of
the future residents of such tracts.”

Dues and Assessments

There are varying plans in use regarding the‘

assessment of property owners and the member-
ship fees charged. A few examples follow which
are typical of the methods in operation through—
out the country.

The recreation area is being maintained and
operated by the Harmon National Real Estate
Corporation until such time as it may be taken
over by the organization representing the lot
owners.

Kings Club District, Long Island, N. Y.

Membership is open to persons who are prop-
erty holders in the Kings Club District as evi-
denced by the map of the Wm. E. Harmon Com-
pany. The initiation fee is $15.00 per member-
ship. The Board of Directors may at any time
waive the initiation fee for a period not exceed—
ing six months. Dues for membership are $12.00

entitled to use the recreational facilities. The
dues for those availing themselves of theprivi-
leges are $12.00 per year payable monthly, quar—
terly or annually. The City Housing Corporation
has appointed a committee of live persons to act
as trustees; two represent the City Housing Cor-

282 CONTROL AND FINANCING

the cost of one membership stock certificate which
participates in the ownership of the property. Of
the fee, $100.00 is applied against the retirement
of stock in the hands of Sleepy Hollow Manor,
Inc. and $50.00 is applied against the reduction
of the mortgage. Dues for the year are $100.00.
This includes membership for the entire family.

Russell Gardens, Great Neck, L. I .

An assessment is levied for maintenance of the
recreation area up to five mills per square foot
of area. This assessment is against all property
in the deve10pment whether owned by Russell
Gardens or others. The park space will ultimately
be deeded to the Russell Gardens Association
comprising owners of property in Russell Gar-
dens, and this Association will pay the taxes and
maintain the property.

New Amsterdam Park and Playgrounds, R. W.
Goode and Co., analo, N. Y.

The parent company has turned the recreation
area over to a membership corporation which
issues one certificate of membership with each lot
to the original purchasers. The lot owner pays
dues of approximately $50.00 a year, which amply
provides for the maintenance of the property.

Homeland, Roland Park Company, Baltimore,
Md.

Property holders are assessed and taxed for
park maintenance.

Broadmoor, Seattle, Washington

A corporation has been formed the name of
which is the Broadmoor Golf Club. The capital
stock, it is stated, shall be $4,000, divided into
400 shares of par value of $10.00. The purposes
for which this corporation is formed shall be the
establishment and maintenance of a golf club for
the purpose of promoting social relations among
its members, and to facilitate and encourage the
game of golf and all other open-air sports, etc.

Forest Hills Garden, Forest Hills, New York

All private parks are maintained by an annual

St. Francis Wood, San Francisco, California

The group of property owners have banded
themselves together forming the St. Francis
Homes Association. The latter pays all taxes and
assessments levied by the authorities upon the
parks and playgrounds.

Palos V erdes Estates, Los Angeles County, Calif.

The Palos Verdes Home Association has been
incorporated. It is a permanent association of
property owners to maintain the plantings, parks,
streets, light and other improvements. The Asso-
ciation has the power to interpret and enforce all
restrictions, and collect the annual maintenance
tax (at a rate never more than the city tax rate
of the old city of Los Angeles) for the upkeep of
the property and for the general benefit of all
property owners.

To this Association has been deeded the titles
to the shorelands, golf course, and other parks,
and also the titles to all dedicated streets. It will
act as a permanent organizing force for commu-
nity activities, helping to promote riding, yacht-
ing and fishing club and to organize pageants and
other worth while community functions.

Radburn, New Jersey

As a guarantee to home owners of the perma-
nence of the parks and open spaces in the areas
now deveIOped, they have been deeded over to
the Radburn Association by the City Housing
Corporation. ‘ The upkeep of these spaces and
facilities is an important duty of the Radburn
Association.

Greenway Parks, Dallas, Texas

The maintenance of the community park areas,
called “Built-in-Playgrounds” by O. H. Koch, the
engineer, is provided for by provisions in the
deed which the purchaser assumes and for which
he pledges an annual assessment, secured by a
first lien on the property, not to exceed $.15 per
one hundred square feet of lot area per annum.
The administration of such maintenance is under
the direction of property owners. The committee
is chosen annually at a meeting of property
owners in each district.

Forms Used

Articles of incorporation under which home
associations and similar groups are organized and
deeds and contracts of sale vary in their pro-
visions regarding recreation areas. A few ex-

The Legal lsoint
of View

Legislation must be the result of
a thorough and conscientious study
and statement of the problem to be

solved or the need to be supplied

XPERIEN CE has shown that there is a need
E for modern, comprehensive planning and

zoning enabling laws. The past decade has
seen considerable progress along this line, but
much needs yet to be done in sub-
division control. A number of
cities have laws affecting the prob-
lem and many cities have made 10-
cal provisions.

Mr. Edward M. Bassett, in
charge of the Legal Division of
the Regional Plan of New York
and Its Environs, in discussing the statutory re—
quirements for setting aside playgrounds in plats
with reference to the amendments to the general
city and village laws of New York State passed
in 1926, said: “Small parks for playgrounds are
nowadays about as necessary as streets. Fast mov-
ing automobiles render all streets dangerous for
play purposes. Yards about houses are usually
too small. Yet in the rapidly growing areas
throughout a region a house is built on every lot
without a thought of setting aside small parks for
playgrounds before the land is built over. After
acres of houses are built and occupied, the cry
for the first time arises for playgrounds. Then
the playgrounds, if established at all, are likely
to be put in the wrong places. Sometimes they
are produced in emergencies by tearing down ex-
isting houses. Some far-seeing developers set
aside small parks in their developments. They

Laws are important, but vol-
untary action on the part of
Planning Commissions and
subdividers can do much to
secure play spaces for our
communities.

say that if small parks for playgrounds are set

aside, the remaining land will sell for enough to

make this profitable. The new laws make possible
an offset of small park land against street land
so that a developer can save on street widths and
throw the saving into small parks.

"The new laws which are per-
missive, as far as their adoption
by any city or village is con-
cerned, provide that:

“Before the approval by the
planning board of a plat showing
a new street or highway, such plat
will also in proper cases show a
park or parks suitably located for playground or
other recreation purposes. In approving such plats
the planning board shall require that . . . the
parks shall be of reasonable size for the neighbor-
hood playgrounds or other recreation uses. In
making such determination regarding streets,
highways and parks, the planning board shall take
into consideration the prospective character of
the development, whether dense residence, open
residence, business or industrial.

“Although no owner is compelled to dedicate
land for a park or playground, these laws pro-
vide a means by which such land may be com-
pelled to be platted for this purpose. A period
of time is prescribed within which the munici-
pality may acquire this land in case the owner
does not choose to dedicate it. The real estate
developer can often be accommodated by certain
changes in street widths or modification of zoning

so that his layout, when including playgrounds,
will be to his advantage.

ilarly amended.

time and place of such hearing not less than five
days before the date fixed therefor. The com-
missioner of city planning shall examine such

parks, if any, are of reasonable size for neighbor-
hood playgrounds or other recreation uses, and
shall report his conclusions in respect to such
matters to the board of estimate and apportion—

1930).

“11. Parks, Schools, Playground Sites, etc.
In subdivising property, due consideration shall
be given by the subdividers and the Commission
to the dedication or reservation of suitable sites
for schools, parks, and playgrounds so as to con-

and general plans of the city and nearby areas.
Such provision should be indicted on the prelim-
inary plan in order that it may be determined

dedicated or acquired.”

Note: The opportunities for cooperation of
the sort implied in the rule above have scarcely
yet been touched. Any subdivision of reasonable
size is almost certain to have a church or'a school
in it at some time. A neighborhood park of at
least twenty acres should be made available for
development in each square mile of residential
area; and small parks of at least ten per cent. of
the total area should be distributed throughout
all residential districts. These incidental features
of every residence district should be planned at

There is nothing in the nature of American consti-

palsying of effort by fear of constitutional difficulties.
The American constitution is sufficiently beneficent
and wide-armed to receive within its protection
whatever is morally and intellectually justifiable and
really needed for the public welfare. Whatever is
done should represent painstaking and thoroughgoing
search into the public needs, into the ascertainment
and statement of the problem and into the working
out of the solution.

By one method or another each community can
within its resources acquire and produce such amount
and distribution of open spaces as it needs and should
have for the health and well being of its people, if it
will but have the courage and intelligence to go
about the development of its plan, its legislative and
administrative procedures in a thoroughgoing, intel-
lectually honest and scientifically patient manner.

the remaining lots will
generally make it pos-
sible for the promoter of
the subdivision to offer
such areas at prices that
will permit immediate
acceptance. Small tracts
for parks, if of usable
size, may, with profit to
the subdivider, be dedi-
cated free to the city.
The advantages of the
park may be capitalized

On America's Playgrounds This Summer

Where

Children Reign Supreme

N Louisville, Kentucky, four traveling play
leaders, two white and two negro, are going
about the city responding to the requests of

neighborhood groups wishing help in arranging a
neighborhood get-together or planning a night
of street play. These leaders are also going to
orphanages, children’s hospitals, churches, and in-
stitutions of all kinds requesting their services.
This service is being conducted during the vaca-
tion months instead of the street play which the
Recreation Division conducted last summer.
The Department of Public Playgrounds and
Recreation of Reading, Pennsylvania, in ccopera—
tion with the Junior League of the city which is
financing the project, is also providing a worker
this summer to help institutions in their play
problems. One of the staff members is devoting
her entire time to visiting the institutions of
Reading and Berks
County with a pro-
gram which is reach-
ing hospital patients,
children of all ages,
delinquent girls, and
nurses. The program
includes games and
occupational therapy
for hospital patients,
storytelling, active
and indoor games,
handcraft, folk danc— .
ing, and dramatics for "W i
t h o s e in orphanages
and similarinstitutions.

Music Popular

And in Mobile, Alabama, “junk” bands, the
name originating with the children themselves, are
enlivening the playground program this summer.

The results may not be pleasing to the mu-
sic critic, but it's great fun for the band!

 

.* I,“ .' a- “... 

These bands are
made up of chil—
dren w h 0 can
play an instru-
ment of any kind—and nothing is excluded from
this unique organization! Thus far guitars have
predominated. One boy is using a one string cello
which he made. Much stress is being laid on play-
ground music and there are ten units of rhythm
bands, ten harmonica bands, and ten ukulele
groups. Professional musicians of the city are
taking a great deal of interest in the music activi—
ties of the playgrounds and are cooperating in
every possible way.

In Jacksonville, Florida, too, music is playing
an important part this summer. The bands pro-
moted by the Playground and Recreation Board,
the philharmonic orchestra, the junior symphonic
orchestra, the drum
and bugle corps, the
mandolin orchestra,
the harmonica band,
the children’s rhythm
band, and a civic
opera association, are
all functioning. Drama
is also considered im-
portant. The Commu-
nity Players early this
summer produced a
bill of one-act plays,
and this group is now
taking drama into the
various communities
through the use of a portable stage set up on the
playgrounds. Street showers are being operated
in seventeen locations, while two swimming pools
are serving the bathing public. These oppor—
tunities to “keep cool” are greatly appreciated.

“287”

A bird's-eye View of the
playgrounds shows many
fascinating activities.

288 ON AMERICA’S PLAYGROUNDS

And on These Hot Days'!

Street showers are delighting the hearts of the
children of Montreal, Canada, for so successful
were the two portable wading pools provided last
summer by the Montreal Kiwanis Club and oper-
ated under the supervision of the Parks and Play-
grounds’ Asso-
ciation, that the
Kiwanians this
year are fur-
nishing a truck
to convey the
apparatus from
one area to an-
other. In addi-
tion to the 32,-
000 Children
w h o enjoyed
the pools and
showers l a s t
year, children
in many other
congested sec-
tions 0 f t h e
c i t y through
Kiwanians’ generosity will be enabled this year to
share in the benefits. Last year the two pools were
used simultaneously, one serving thickly popu-
lated sections in the east end, the other, similar
districts in the west end. The firemen of the
various stations decided to join in the fun, and
when it came their turn to have the pool they
purchased liquid soap and helped give the boys
and girls shampoos and baths. °

The dips offered a splendid means of getting in
contact with parents and children who were badly
in need of the sort of assistance which the recently
established Health Service, operated in connection
with the playgrounds, was ready to give boys and
girls. Last year on certain days a doctor, a trained

the playgrounds in turn, examining the children
and advising them how to build up healthy bodies.
The service is being continued this summer.

Working to Win Their Awards

More than 2,000 Seattle boys and girls began
their long awaited and highly prized summer vaca-
tion by enrolling in “school,” the school in this
case being the Playground Achievement Club,
conducted by the Playground Division of the
Seattle Park Department. And today on every
one of the city’s twenty-eight play fields these
boys and girls are earnestly working on their “les-

 

sons,” intent upon earning enough points to win
a blue, red or white achievement club ribbon—~—
the highest play field award attainable.

The school room is a shady play field corner,
and the “pupils” make boats, cars, dolls and toy
houses, and swim, dive and play ball in their
c l a s s e s. The
teachers are
there, too, play
leaders who are
the c o n s ta n t
companions of
th e children
throughout the
summer. A n d
to carry out
the analogy, the
much sought
“ 100” is the
perfect in a r k
in the play-
ground school
as well as in
the convention-
al three R’s.

Twenty events in all are listed on each child’s
achievement card under the classification of ath-
letic achievements, hobbies, and special achieve-
ments. with three left open to the play leader to
fit the local conditions. For athletic achievements
the boy or girl must pass one physical ability test
—one to five points credit; must compete on a
playground team—five points or none; place in
local “C” events—limit of five points; participate
in an all-city event—five points or none; do any
standard athletic stunts—one point for each with
a limit of five, and he must also teach a game to
an organized group or umpire a game—one to
five points.

For hobby achievements the child is required to
complete two handcraft articles—one to five
points; to play a musical instrument or show satis-
factory results in anorher hobby—five points or
none; to read a book from an approved list—five
points or none, and to mount and name ten nature
specimens—one point for each two completed.

Special achievements involve doing a good turn
on the playground—one to five points; enrolling
an achievement club member—five points or none;
demonstrating a method of first aid—one to five
points; attending Camp Denny. the municipal
overnight playground camp, or any other approved
camp—five points or none; swimming twenty-five
feet—five points or none, and performing a stand-

ard divewlive points or none. Suggestions for
the remaining three events include ability to score
a baseball game, membership in an outside club
or organization, leadership in a local special day
program, ability to tie standard knots and to tell
a story satisfactorily to a group on the playground.
One hundred points is the maximum score.
N inety-hve points earn a blue ribbon which carries
the same splendor and prestige as the traditional
blue ribbons of horse racing. Eighty or more
points earn a red ribbon, while sixty-five or more
qualify the child for a white ribbon. Any boy
or girl in the city under sixteen years of age is
eligible to join the Achievement Club. Score
cards, 9 by 5 inches, are issued to each member
and on these the play leaders tally the points
earned. The period in which ribbons may be
earned- extends from june 13th to August 29th,
but awards earned before the Final day are im-
mediately presented to the victorious youth.
Children on the Birmingham, Alabama, play—
grounds are competing for points in a merit sys-
tem in which participation and accomplishment
count. Under the new plan all children coming

/2§2(

to the playgrounds are registered by play leaders
and a daily record of each will be kept. Any boy
or girl who enters a number of the events has an
opportunity to win an award. Loving cups will
be awarded at the end of the season for winners
of the greatest number of points won, and ten
awards, consisting of park board monograms or
similar insignia, will be made for high scores in
each of six classes—junior boys; senior boys;
junior girls; senior girls; men, and women. There
will be three pennants offered for which the play—
grounds will compete throughout the season.
These pennants will be awarded at the end of two
weeks to the three playgrounds which make the
best scores and show the best participation dur-
ing the hrst two weeks. Winners will hold the
pennants two weeks and at the end of that time
they will go to the playgrounds showing best
scores for the preceding two weeks. The Board
will continue to award ribbons to winners from
the various classes at the pet show, doll buggy
parade, the handcraft exhibit and other similar
events. Thus individual winners and entire
groups will have the thrill of accomplishment.

Whatever else the playground program may offer, how very long the list,
it's not complete unless there is an opportunity for handcraft activities.

Baseball, says the pessimist, is losing its popular-
ity with boys. This bird’s-eye View doesn't prove it!

Activities of All Kinds

Each of the Irvington, New Jersey, play-
grounds has selected a nation for its own, and the
program of folk dancing, music, craft activities
and games which is now going on, is based on the
customs of the country the playground is repre-
senting. This will lead up to a final International
Day at the close of the season, when instead of
the customary circus there will be craft exhibits
and demonstrations of cultural as well as physical
activities. An area of a large play field will be
allotted each nation for displaying its exhibit.

Three major handcraft projects are being car-
ried out on the playgrounds of Decatur, Illinois——
marionettes, silvercraft and vase making. Camp
parties are another popular activity. Children who
visit the playgrounds are being given an Oppor-
tunity to enjoy two-day camping parties sponsored
by the Pines Community Association. Camp facili-
ties and supervision are provided by the associa-
tion, the children furnishing their own food sup-
plies and the necessary blankets. The camps are
being maintained on a budget of $300.

At Bloomfield, New Jersey, the Recreation
Commission is holding a Fathers’ and Mothers’
Night once every two weeks on each playground
with a special program of games, community sing-
ing, and other activities that fathers, mothers, and
children can enjoy together. Simple folk dancing
is a part of the program.

The miniature airplane makers of Detroit,
Michigan, are fortunate in having the use of the
large hangar at the Detroit airport for their activi-
ties. The boys have been given a side room in
which to make their planes and they are permitted
to fly them in the hangar when it is not being

used for the storage of airships. The Depart-

ment of Recreation, in co-
operation with the Detroit
News, initiated a novelty
event in an auto—giro model
airplane contest open to all
boys and girls under
twenty-one years of age.
The News published a
series of drawings to guide
the model builders.

Many of the ninety play-
g ro_u n d s in Westchester
County have toy symphony
orchestras this summer, and
r h y t h m sticks, triangles,
tambourines, c a s t a n e t 5,
wood blocks, jingle sticks
and drums are vying in popularity with coping
saws, hammers and other tools of the handcraft
program which a member of the staff of the Coun-
ty Recreation Commission is promoting in her
weekly visits. Another worker from the Com-
mission is visiting the playgrounds organizing
dramatics, while the Commission’s nature lore
Specialist, through nature talks and exhibits at
the various centers is acquainting the children
with the mysteries of nature and introducing them
to native birds, trees, rocks, flowers and plants.
The traveling circus is making its rounds again
this year, and rehearsals for the “greatest show
in the County” are now under way.

Athletics Everywhere—Especially Ball
Games !

Approximately 3,040 adults and 500 boys are
playing mush ball (indoor baseball) in parks, cor-
ner lots, school yards, and parking places in York,
Pa. The adults are members of 102 regularly
organized league teams and fifty independent
teams. The boys are members of twenty-four
teams in three playground leagues and of a score
or more of independent clubs. Many of the mem-
bers are unemployed men and older boys, and the
activity is doing much, according to the recreation
officials, to maintain their morale in this difTicult
period.

One of the most interesting activities being
promoted by the West Chicago Park Commis-
sioners this summer is the Stanford Park Twi-
light Baseball League, composed of ten senior
teams of twenty players each. The average age
of the players is about twenty-eight years and the
majority of the men playing are in business or in
various professions in the neighborhood. It was

ON AMERICA’S PLAYGROUNDS 291

found that there was a real need for organized
tournaments conducted over a period of several
months with rules made as lenient as possible.
For example, a soft ball fourteen inches in cir-
cumference is used, and the pitching is slow in or-
der to enable the batter to hit the ball, thereby
giving the infield and outfield an opportunity to
play continuously. The distance for the bases is
sixty feet; balls and strikes are called to prevent
stalling, but all other rules are the same as those
controlling regular baseball.

The team is made up of a variety of nationali-
ties and interest is very keen. There is a nightly
attendance of from 800 to 1,500 people. The
tournament is conducted on a double round robin
basis divided into two halves. First and second
place winners of each half will play in final series
of three games in September to determine the
champions and the runners-up. Between the first
and second half the plan is carried out of allowing
the teams to add any new players, make transfers,
and strengthen the team before the first game,
but no changes are allowed after the half begins.
By dividing the tournament into two halves the
beneficial effect is secured of tending to prevent
the team down in league standing from becoming
discouraged and dropping out. This gives the
team a new lease of life. A nominal entry fee is
charged for the purpose of holding the interest of
the teams in the league, and this money is ex-
pended for trophies and medals selected by the
managers themselves. All protests, which must
be in writing, are taken up at the end of each
half and the managers who are the governing
board, decide on the merits of each protest. Ex-
perience has shown this

600 boys and men. In the case of the senior and
junior divisions the teams furnish their own balls
and bats; in the Teenie Weenie League balls and
bats are furnished by the Commissioners.

Baseball is making rapid strides in Elmira, New
York, as well as in York and Chicago. This year
over 1,000 men and boys are playing in the base-
ball teams organized by the Recreation Commis-
sion. There are fourteen leagues of ninety-six
teams; fivc__leagues of thirty-two teams of boys
under fourteen years of age are being sponsored
by the Elks Club which is giving trophies to the
winning teams of each league and banquets for
all the teams. The plan is being followed of leav-
ing the game in the hands of the boys, no adult
coaches being allowed on the side lines. The
older boys in the American Legion and junior
leagues are taking a great deal of interest in the
midget leagues, are organizing some of the teams
and helping to coach them. As the boys leave the
midget leagues they go into the junior leagues
and most of them are organizing their own midget
teams. The responsibility which the boys are
assuming is doing much to develop leadership.

This summer the Department of Public Play-
grounds and Recreation of Reading, Pennsylvania,
is administering the entire tennis program, and a
new system of reserving courts has been intro-
duced. Telephone reservations may be made
twenty-four hours ahead through the recreation
headquarters. Reservations are recorded by the
number of the court and the number of the player
on a master sheet. Players are required to regis-
ter not only their own numbers but the numbers
of their partner and opponents. Individuals wish-

ing to reserve courts are

to be the best policy.

The younger boys,
who' watched the sen-
iors play daily, asked to
be organized into a
league of their own
with the result that at
the present time there
is a Junior League of
twelve teams of twenty
boys each. In addition,
a Teenie Weenie
League of boys between
the ages of ten and fif-
teen has been organ-
ized. Altogether there
are in active competi-
tion in all the leagues

August 14

On August 14 the attention of the nation will
center on the public playgrounds of the United
States. President Hoover has written a Special
message to the two and a half million boys and girls
of the playgrounds, which, printed on cards, will be
distributed to them on that day. From 266 com-
munities requests for one million of the cards have
already been received at the headquarters of the
National Recreation Association.

The day will be given over to Field meets, pa-
geants, amateur sports, story-telling festivals, and
other Special programs in celebration of twenty-five
years of recreation progress. One large city will
make the day the beginning of a two weeks' cam-
paign to interest parents in the public playgrounds
used by their children.

Have you completed your plans for this gala
occasion? If not, be sure to write or wire the Asso-
ciation for your cards, in order that the children of
your community may not be disappointed. '

OW’ that summer is here many are respond-
ing to the invitation to play in the great
outdoors which for weeks has been broad-

cast by old Mother Nature. City parks are being
thronged with recreation seekers and an increas-
ing army of motorists is invading the country—
side. The hiker, the fisherman and the camper
are abroad in the land! In fact the real playtime
of the year has come to those living north of the
equator and every one of us is looking forward
to some relaxation in the open.

The United States is fortunate in having many
natural facilities for outdoor recreation. Moun-
tains, forests, lakes and streams are within reach
of nearly every community. Important in the out-
door recreation field are the national forests, ad—
ministered by the Forest Service United States
Department of Agriculture. Rich in scenic
beauty, as well as in natural wonders and historic
interest, they are among the leading playgrounds
of the nation. There are 151 national forests.
located in thirty states, as well as Alaska and
Porto Rico. and containing in the aggregate an
area of 160,000,000 acres or nearly seven per cent
of the total land area of the country.

Camps provided in the national forests
offer all the joys the camper can with.

— with Uncle Sam

The Forest Service of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture tells
us how to use our many national
forests to the best advantage.

That recreation has grown to be one of the
major uses of the national forests is demonstrated
by the fact that last year they were visited by
over 31,000,000 vacationists. including pic—
nickers, motorists, hikers. campers, fishermen,
hunters, hotel and resort visitors and summer resi—
dents. National forest administration is there-
fore looking more and more to the development
of recreational facilities. Roads and well-marked
trails are being extended to make the forests easily
accessible and there are countless secluded spots
along the banks of streams and lakes where the
camper may pitch his tent. free of charge, al—
though on some forests it is necessary to secure
a camp fire permit. In localities frequented by
large numbers of people free public camp grounds
are being improved by the Forest Service and
sanitary facilities, fireplaces. water supplies. and
other camp conveniences are being provided for

OUT-OF-DOORS PVITH UNCLE 5AM 293.

the comfort of visitors. At the close of 1930 about
1,700 of these camp grounds, either wholly or
partially improved, were being used. Some 1,200
hotels, resorts, and summer camps and 10,770
private summer homes are operating under per-
mit. Under free permit fifteen municipal recrea-
tion camps are operated in national forests on a
non-profit basis by several of the larger muni-
cipalities of California. The Forest Service has
also issued permits for summer camps on National
Forests in various parts of the country to a num—
ber of organizations such as the Boy Scouts, Girl
Scouts and Y. M. C. A.

Big game is found in the mountainous parts
of the national forests, and many excellent trout
streams and lakes, periodically restocked with
young fish, offer keen sport to the angler. Out-
side .of certain game refuges within the national
forests, the only restrictions on hunters and fish-
ermen are those imposed by the state fish and
game laws. In fact, all that the Forest Service
asks of any visitor is that he look to the proper
sanitation of his camp or picnic ground and to
care with fire. For purposes of public education
and recreation the Forest Service under a recent
departmental regulation, is establishing a series.
of representative areas in the national forests
known as “primitive areas” wherein those who
crave the “back-to-nature” type of recreation
will find wilderness unimpaired. Within these
areas, so far as is practicable, primitive con-
ditions of environment, transportation, habi-
tation and subsistence will be kept. In
maintaining such areas the Forest Service
hopes to prevent the impairment of
unique natural values and to give the
public opportunity to know the condi-
tions which existed in the pioneer
stages of the country’s development
and to engage in the forms of recre—
ation characteristic of that period.

National forests are found with—
in reasonable traveling distance in
nearly every part of the country.
Although the majority of them
still lie west of the Great
Plains, forests have been cre—
ated in the Lake States, in the
White Mountains, the Cen—
tral and Southern Appala-
chians, the Ozarks, and
other sections of the east
and south. Recreation

The Camp Fire

When picnics, camps and other outings
are the order of the day there will often
be occasion for a camp fire. To most
persons half the pleasure of a woods
outing is in building and cooking over
a fire. But notwithstanding its use-
fulness and charm, there is no
greater potential source of danger
than the improperly made camp
fire. Carelessly handled almost
in the twinkling of an eye it can
set loose a devouring demon
and turn a sylvan paradise
into a roaring furnace. It
therefore behooves the ten-
derfoot to learn the ways of
a camp fire before he at-
tempts to build one in the
woods. For this reason
the Forest Service has

forests, and visitors are free to enjoy the out-of—doors as they will.

formulated the following rules for care with camp
fires in the forest:

Be sure that the building of camp tires is per-
mitted in your State, and if necessary obtain a
camp fire permit.

Before building a camp fire, scrape away all
inflammable material from a space five feet in
diameter. Dig a shallow hole in the center and
in it build the fire. Keep the fire small, large
ones are inconvenient for cooking and are danger-
ous. Never build tires against trees or logs, or
near brush.

To extinguish a camp fire stir the ashes and
coals, drenching them with water. Turn over the
partly burned sticks and wet both sides thor-
oughly. Wet the ground all around the fire. If
water is not available, stir in mineral soil-—earth,
and not leaf mold, and tread it down until packed
tight over and around the fire.

N ever leave camp, either permanently or for a
few minutes’ stroll in the woods, unless your fire
is out—dead out.

Additional Forest Service rules for care with
fire are found in the following instructions:

Be sure your match is out. Break it in two
before you throw it away.

Be sure that pipe ashes and cigar or cigarette
stubs are dead before throwing them away.

Cooperate with forest rangers or State officers
in reporting and suppressing forest fires.

A shovel, an ax, and a bucket are indispensible
equipment for a camping party. The man who
builds a camp fire without having equipped him-

self with the means to extinguish it is as foolish
as the boatman who puts to sea without oars.

It is never safe to build large bonfires in a
mountain country where sudden drafts of air may
scatter the fire and carry flame swiftly up the
mountain 310pes.

Good Manners in the Forest

“Good manners in the forest” consists in carry-
ing to the woods the fundamental decencies of
our everyday lives. By means of the sun, the
winds, and rain, Nature effects perpetual sanita-
tion, and no self-respecting recreationist will
offend against her sanitary laws. He will keep
his camp or picnic ground clean and leave it so
for his successor. Departing he will collect all
scattered papers, broken boxes or bottles, empty
tin cans, and fruit skins. All refuse will be de-
stroyed or buried. He will of course be careful
with fire and will do nothing to destroy the nat-
ural beauty of his surroundings. With little effort
he can leave the woods as attractive as he found
them and have the satisfaction of knowing that
he has been a “good sportsman.”

What to Do When Lost in the Forest

Merely being out of sight of others in a strange
forest gives many a person the creeps. This is a
natural feeling, but a dangerous one, for in the
mountains the grip of fear or panic too often
leads to trouble. Loss of mental control is more
serious than lack of food, water, clothing or pos-
sible proximity of wild animals. It is the man

OUT—OF—DOORS WITH UNCLE SAM 295

who keeps his head who has the best chance to
come through in safety. The following helpful
rules are therefore worth remembering:

1. Stop, sit down and try to figure out where
you are. Use your head, not your legs.

2. If caught by night, fog or storm, stop at
Once and make camp in a sheltered spot«-——-
protected by a ledge or large boulder or a
fallen tree—clear a space of ground and
build a fire. Lacking fire, use leaves and
branches for shelter.

3. Don’t wander about. Travel only down
hill.

4. If injured or exhausted, choose a clear spot
on a promontory, if possible, and make a
signal smoke by building a fire and throw-
ing green branches and wet wood on the
blaze.

5. 'Don’t yell, don't run, don’t worry, and,
above all, don’t quit!

The advice of the forest ranger to the new
camper, hiker, or vacationist is: “It is better to
carry a clear head on your shoulders than a big
pack on your back. Yet in going alone it is best
to go prepared to get lost. A fish line and a few
hooks, matches in a waterproof box, a compass,
a little concentrated food and a strong knife
carried along may save a lot of grief. A gun may
help as a signal, seldom for game.

“A thinking man is never lost for long. He
knows that, surviving a night in the forest, he
may awake to a clear dawn, and readily regain his
location. His compass may be useless because of
local magnetic attraction, but he may know what
kind of vegetation grows on the shady side and
what on the sunny side of a ridge. He knows
that streams going down and ridges going up do
not branch. He knows that wild food which
sustains animals may be eaten sparingly; that he
will not die of hunger as quickly as- of thirst;
that he must remain where he is or push on to
some definite objective, but not to the point of
exhaustion; that some one will be looking for
him. And strength in the
knowledge makes the hard-
ships easier.

“Keep the old brain in com-
mission and the chances are
you will come out of the woods
on your own feet.”

year, they are especially so in summer when
the leaves are fully developed and every tree is
displaying a heavy mantle of green. Growing
separately or in the woods they tell a fascinating
story of nature’s handiwork, and afford the rec-
reation leader interesting subjects for summer
entertainment. They can be studied on the play-
ground, on the street, or in the park. Best of all
is a hike or picnic in the woods, where one can
see trees of many kinds and ages and the condi-
tions under which they grow. If the expedition
includes a person who knows and loves the trees,
so much the better.

Summer is the time to learn to identify the
broadleaf trees by their leaves; not only the trees
of the various families but the different members
of those families, each of which has a distinctive
leaf form. Some tree families, the oaks for in-
stance, have a large number of different species,
and to learn the various local members of those
families may be a task in itself. According to the
revised list of American trees* published by the
Forest Service, there are 862 species, 228 varie-
ties, and eighty-seven hybrids, making a total of
1,117 known forms of trees in American forests.
Numerous books on tree identification** have been
published and are available from most large pub-
lic libraries. A number of the states have pre-
pared tree guides describing the various charac-
teristics of their native forest trees. Since these
guides might be of use to recreation leaders in
identifying trees, a list of States publishing popu-
lar tree guides and agencies to whom applications

Forest Photographs

Photographs have any number of possibilities
and the forest offers exceptional opportunities to
the amateur photographer. Here he may obtain
pictures showing many interesting subjects such
as recreational uses of the forest, game and wild
life at home, forest-tree studies, results of forest
fires, forest industries, forest types and forest
freaks. Such pictures may win him prizes in a
contest or exhibit of beautiful or distinctive photo-
graphs. If he has enough of them. he may have
a personal exhibit at his home or at the community
recreation center. And if they do nothing else,

County Parks Aid Nature Study

County-wide interest in nature study has been
shown in practically every unit of the Union
County park system, especially during the past
year when several new clubs were organized. The
County Park Commission through its various de-
partments has given as much service as possible
to clubs and individuals by suggesting hike routes,
marking trees, mapping nature trails and supply-
ing meeting places whenever needed. The mark-
ing of trees in many of the units of the park
system was one of the first steps in the program

of nature study and it is hoped to promote identi-
fication of shrubs in a similar way.

A nature trail in the \Vatchung Reservation
has been launched, and here 31 species of shrubs
and six varieties of trees not found locally have
been planted.

The programs of the various nature clubs which
have been organized in a number of communities
are taking the form of nature hikes and indoor
meetings at which such subjects as Fish as a
H obby and Rock Gardening are discussed.

“CHICAGO” Equipment has been designed after
exhaustive tests, by experts who have had prac-
tical experience on playgrounds and in gym-
naSIunIs; by men who know from actual use where
strength is needed, where weather-proofing must
be doubled—where equipment

In closing Mr. Lohmann says: “Just as city planning
in the past has contributed of its best to civilization, let
us hope that its results in the cities of the future will
justify these words of the novelist (H. G. \Vells)—But
who can tell of the fullness and pleasure of life; who can
number all of our new cities, cities made by loving hands
of men for living men; cities men weep to enter, so fair
they are, so gracious, so kind.”

Columbia Camp Con-
certs is the name given
a series of weekly broad-
casts initiated this sum-
mer by the Columbia Broadcasting System in co-
operation with the Coordinating Council of
Nature Study Activities. The series was opened
July lst and will extend to September 9th. Each
program presents a variety of subjects interesting
to children at camp and to nature lovers every-
where. For the children a series of radio games
has been arranged for each program. Vocal and
instrumental music by some of the world’s fore-
most composers will show how different natural
phenomena suggest certain musical forms and
moods. An additional feature of these programs
is a series of community songs in which listeners
are asked to participate actively.

in Decatur.

set this, a new game was invented which is being
used very effectively this summer on the play-
grounds. The name “Bolf,” which has been
adopted, comes from the two words, “bum” and
“golf.” The game is played with hockey sticks,
which can be bought for 25 cents, and sponge
rubber balls the size of tennis balls, which are
purchased for $1 per dozen. The foot of the
hockey stick is cut off so that it is about six.
inches long across the bottom. In this way it is
less liable to be broken and mor‘e nearly resembles
a golf club. The course is laid out in the same
way as a small sized golf course, and regular golf
rules are used in playing the game. On crowded
playgrounds where deep cuts would be dangerous
if left uncovered, the cups are made one inch deep
and a coffee can lid is used for a cup.

The Department of
Recreation of Cleveland,
Ohio, this year reversed
the usual order of events
and presented a demonstration program previous
to rather than at the end of the season. This was
done in an effort to enlist the interest and help of
adults. “The more you know of the efforts to
give your children a delightful and worth while
summer program,” states a message from the
Commissioner of Recreation, “the more you will
encourage their attendance
and perhaps just that much
more you will be able and
willing to assist the play

Early this year the
American City Maga-
zine announced a cone
test for the best play-
ground idea carried out in 1930. L. H. Weir of
the National. Recreation Association, who served
as judge, has selected Reading, Pennsylvania,
among the cities of 50,000 population or over as
having presented the most outstanding and far—
reaching idea, “in that it represents general ad-
vancement in planning, increasing facilities,
broadening the scope of recreational service, and
securing their effective cooperation among public
and private agencies.”

For cities under 50,000, Laurel, Mississippi,
with about 18,000 inhabitants, was chosen for its
idea of combining beauty with facilities for active
recreation in all its parks and recreation areas.
“Every playground or other active recreation
area,” says Mr. Weir, “should have some of the
characteristics of a park, and most park areas
should have some form or forms of active recrea—
tion facilities. The love of beauty is one of the
natural and fundamental hungers of the human
soul.” ,

The newest playground in Reading, Pennsyl—
vania, shown in the picture, which will be known
as “Eleventh and Pike,” is divided into three ter-
races. The top level will have three hard sur—

A Play Institute in Washington.—One of
the most recent activities of the Community Cen-
ter Department, Public Schools of the District of
Columbia, was a Play Institute held for six Mon-
day evenings beginning March 16th, from 8:00
to 10:00 P. M. The purpose was “to furnish
practice and participation in games, stunts, com—
munity singing, and special programs for leaders
of groups of all ages.” New stunts and games

° were discussed and conducted, experiences ex-

changed, and bulletins containing the most suc-
cessful ideas issued. The program included
dramatic stunts and games, old time dances, folk
dances, group singing, games for the home, out-
door games, and an open evening. Each person
attending paid a registration fee of $1.00.

An Institute of Girls’ Work—An all day
institute on work of girls was held in Chicago on
April 9th under the auspices of the Section on
\Vork with Girls of the Council of Social
Agencies of the city. Four round table discus-
sion groups were provided in the morning. At
the luncheon meeting Mr. H. M. Busch of \Vest-
ern Reserve University spoke on the philosophy
of leisure for a new age; the modern trends which
must be recognized in planning a leisure time
program; characteristics of the city mind; the
growth of specialization resulting in a narrowing
cultural interest, and the confiict of luxury de-
sires and sense of instability which finds expres-
sion in our leisure time. Mr. Busch spoke of
the necessity for developing physical and mental
skills and of providing leadership for young peo-
ple. This was followed by an informal discus-
sion, to which the audience “listened in,” between
a school principal, a college professor, a psychia-
trist, a recreation expert and a parent, on social
contacts between boys and girls.

Wilkes Barre Workers Enjoy Recreation.
—During 1930, in spite of the economic depres-
sion, 2,390 employees belonging to the Store
Employees Association in Wilkes Barre, Penn-
sylvania, an organization fostered by the Play-
ground and Recreation Association of Wyoming
Valley, paid for 84 per cent of their organized
recreation, while the employers paid for only 16
per cent. The average cost per participant to
the employers was 31 cents. That participants
themselves spent an average of $1.53 per person.
Forty—four organizations were members of the
Association during 1930.

Jersey, issues a monthly known as “the Cen-

the March issue which appears in two colors is
a linoleum block print by one of the attendants
at the Center, taken from an original drawing
which he made. Every month there is a new
cover, always an original one designed by a
Center member.

“Make Room for the Children.”—In an ar-

ticle entitled Make Room for the Children which
appears in the November, 1930 issue of the

I Delineator, Samuel Crumbine tells how apartment .

houses can provide for the play needs of children.
He gives some general suggestions and then
makes a statement that unless we give recogni—
tion to the problem of providing play spaces for
children, the city—the most vivid expression of

this generation—will become the enemy of the
next.

 

Robert W. deFores’r

N the death of Robert W. deForest the Na-
I tional Recreation Association has lost one of

its earliest friends and most effective and
loyal supporters. In 1907 Mr. deForest sent a
personal representative to the first Recreation
Congress at Chicago, Illinois, to study the new
movement and report upon its value. As a result
of this report‘he, with others in the Russell Sage
Foundation, of which he was president, voted
to underwrite the cost of a special effort to raise
money for the organization then known as the
Playground Assbciation of America. The Rus-
sell Sage Foundation also made it possible for
Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick to give much of his
time, and Lee F. Hanmer all his time, to working
to establish the playground and recreation move-
ment in America, and this help was of the very
greatest value to the new movement.

Mr. deForest’s sympathetic and understanding
interest in play and recreation, so effective at the
beginning of the institution, lasted to the end.
With all his varied interests he still found time
for personal thought on the problems of the na-
tional recreation movement in America. Only a

danger of disuse and would therefore be lost to
the public, are being mapped and their condition
reported. This service to hikers is only one feature
of a permanent program designed to make outdoor
life as easily available as possible to large num-
bers of English city dwellers.

Pasadena’s Eighth Annual Banquet.—On
March 24th the Pasadena, California, Department
of Recreation, formerly known as Playground
Community Service, held its eighth annual ban-
quet. A review of the activities of the department
was presented in dramatic form. There were six
scenes—(1) the ofiice of the department; (2) a
typical playground; (3) the costume room; (4)
playground dramatics; (5) evening recreation;
(6) the circus. This method of presenting activi-
ties proved highly successful.

A Party-a-Month Club.—A Party-a-Month
Club is an important feature of the program of
the Morgantown, West Virginia, Department of
Recreation, Independent School District. At each
meeting on the first \Vednesday of every month
seasonal games are played which members of the
club will in turn use at parties they will conduct.
Each month a fourteen page booklet is given out
containing directions for seasonal games and
stunts. A registration fee of $1 is charged to
cover the cost of material for the club.

Jacksonville’s Circus for the Unemployed.

berless other specialty acts and performers made

benefit of the unemployed a howling success.
There were 98 acts and a thousand performers in
this mammoth circus held on February 22nd at
the Municipal Auditorium. The Playground and
Recreation Board was in charge and all city de-
partments cooperated to make it a success. The
event aroused so much enthusiasm that it may
become an annual affair.

Where Love of Art Predominates.—Since
1634 the peasants of the little village of Oberam-
mergau have been presenting the Passion Play.
For years before this first presentation the Ben-
edictine Monastery of Ettal, a few miles from
Oberammergau, had exerted a great cultural in-
fluence over the entire valley. It was the monks
of Ettal who taught the people of this region
wood-carving, trained them in music and the
presentation of religious dramas, and in many
other ways made them superior to the average
mountain peasantry of Bavaria. Because of the
love of art inculcated by the monks of Ettal and
fostered by successive generations of parish
priests at Oberammergau, the village now pos-
sesses a state school of wood-carving, a public
school in which the children receive their first
training in elocution and singing, and a Practice
Theatre in which the youth of the village have
the dpportunity to acquire proficiency as actors,
thus 'equipping themselves to attain the great am-
bition of their lives—a part in the Passion Play.

Is there anywhere in America a community in
which art holds so important a place?

Model Aircraft Tournaments—From April
16th to April 19th, the District of Columbia
Model Aircraft League, conducted by the Com-
munity Center Department, held a contest and ex—
hibition of true scale models of airplanes and
gliders which were judged for workmanship.
There were three classes according to size—Baby.
Class A—contained within span of man’s palm;
Detroit, Class B—Wing-span of exactly 24
inches; and Optional, Class C—All other sizes of
models up to 60 inch wing-span not included in
Classes A and B. The requirements were that
the planes submitted must be scale models of real
planes or gliders and must be built entirely by
the contestant. ‘

The Playground Department of the West Chi-
cago Park Commissioners conducted its first an-
nual indoor airplane meet on April 25th. Two
types of planes were permitted in the contest—
fuselage and the stick models.

A Drama Tournament in Oshkosh.—A very
successful drama tournament was conducted in
the late winter and early spring by the Depart-
ment of Recreation and Physical Education,
Board of Education, Oshkosh, \Visconsin. The
six contesting groups were representatives of the
young people’s societies of six churches. The
winners were the group presenting Think It
Over who had been coached by Miss Ruby Heine
of the Trinity Lutheran Church, an invalid con-
fined to a wheel chair. The plays were judged
on the basis of twenty points each for choice of
play, stage setting, costuming, and make-up.

The Why of Recreation Areas
(Continued from page 258)

as paved streets, transportation lines and public
water supplies. Every progressive community
today recognizes this fact and arranges its budget
so that these serviceable features may be regu-
larly enlarged and improved as the pOpulation of
the city increases.

A community center crowded with young people
enjoying wholesome recreation and social contact
under municipal auspices is a guarantee of better
citizenship and something to be proud of. A
connnodious playground teeming with youngsters
every day of the year is evidence of a city’s great-
ness quite as impressive as smoking factory
chimneys.”

Recreation Areas and the City Plan

(Continued from page 264)
Leadership for Recreation Areas

It is of fundamental importance to provide land
which will be used permanently for recreation pur-
poses, but it is also important to have leadership
so that the areas provided will be used to the
greatest advantage. In increasing numbers sub-
dividers are employing trained recreation direc-
tors. Radburn, New Jersey; Sunnyside, Long
Island; Jackson Heights, Long Island; Palos
Verdes Estate, Los Angeles; Southside Park,
Houston are employing their own play leaders.
Few subdividers, however, can afford to furnish
leadership for a playground indefinitely, and this
is one of the principal arguments for the wisdom
of deeding the area to the city.

One of the reasons attributed to the failure of
some recreation areas in real estate subdivisions
has been lack of leadership or incompetent leader-
ship. Mr. C. C. Hieatt, ex-president of the
National Association of Real Estate Boards, has

said: “A subdivider who has any regard for the
future value of his prOperty Would hesitate before
opening up an uncontrolled and unsupervised
playground in the heart of it. There must be
supervision or it will turn out to be a nuisance
and depreciate values. The subdivider who ex-
pects to do anything of that kind ought to do it
in cooperation with the recreation man or with
some expert in recreation, so as to get the best
possible advice as to where the playground and
recreation centers should be located and how they
ought to be set up.”

The National Recreation Association, through
the National Recreation School in New York
City, is training recreation leaders who are avail-
able for positions in all parts of the country, and
will be glad to be of service in helping subdividers
secure. leaders.

Communities

"T his conveyance is made, however, subject to
the following conditions to all and singular of
which the Grantee herein, for its successors and
assigns, by the acceptance of this deed, assents
and agrees to be bound thereby, and which con-
ditions are to run with the land herein conveyed,
viz.: '

“That the property shall be used in perpetuity

“That the land shall be open to all persons ex-
cept that with the written consent of the Harmon
Foundation reasonable racial restrictions may be
' imposed.

“That the land shall be open free of charge to
all, except that under reasonable regulations ad-
mission may be charged for amateur athletic con-

The Legal Point of View

will require the owner to dedicate for public pur-
poses, such as parks, playgrounds‘and school sites,
an area not more than five (5)“ percent. of the
total area of the tract of 'land proposed to be
platted, except where in'the opinion of. such Com-
mission five (5) per cent. of the area is too small

for parks, playgrounds and school sites, when no
public dedication of said tract shall be required.
The five (5) per cent. hereinbefore referred to
shall be exclusive of any area of said tract of land
dedicated for streets and alleys.”

On America's Playgrounds
(Continued from page 291)

playgrounds conducted by the Playground and
Recreation Association of Wyoming Valley,
Pennsylvania, and a week has been set aside
especially for visits of mothers and fathers to
the playgrounds. During that week play lead-
ers will register the visits of the parents on
specially prepared cards, reporting in writing on
the back of the weekly attendance card the number
of visits made by mothers and fathers.

The making of articles of home usefulness will
be an important feature of the week’s program.
Lamp shade making has been scheduled as the
main handcraft project of the week for both girls
and boys. Mother’s visit to the playground, it
has been suggested to the children, will be a good
opportunity to present her with the new rug made
this summer on the playground. Boys will make
for their fathers, door-stops, letter-openers, paper
weights and boxes for various purposes.
