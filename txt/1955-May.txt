Unless we miss our guess, this bright young miss
enjoys her backyard play! And, rightly, it’s “all in
the family” because she is a granddaughter of the
NRA. Her granddaddy is George Nesbitt, head of

Nesbitt, a camera enthusiast, who took and de-

SPRING CLEANING w
or Family Play and Community Life

No! NOT AGAIN! Why just last Fri-

day you vacuumed and polished!
Now you start all over!” Have you ever
heard that before?

Relax though, the spring cleaning we
discuss here is of a different order or,
* as the lawyers say, the cleaning of the
spring.

In the fall, years ago, we used to take
over our uncle’s camp in the Adiron-
dacks for two weeks. Miles from a rail-
road and from neighbors, we could fill
our souls to overflowing with quiet,
sights, sounds, fragrances—in prepara-
tion for the long winter months in the
city.

Our first ritual upon arriving, after
starting a blaze in the huge fireplace,
was the cleaning of the spring. All twigs,
leaves, and bark were cleaned away
until one could see the clear golden
sand and bubbling water at the bottom.
In the morning there it was, a gold-
lined bowl framed with russet, maroon,
and green moss, contributing its over-
flow of sparkling water through its own
small channel into the Raquette River.

Families are like that. For families
are the wellsprings of community and
national life.

Communities are but aggregations of
neighborhoods. Neighborhoods, in turn,
are but aggregations of families. These
family wellsprings feed and make the
larger currents of neighborhoods and
community life. They must be kept
clean, as clear-flowing and sparkling as
that camp spring. It is here that one
finds “the grass roots” often referred
to. Here are the foundations and the
true strength of America.

If these wellsprings are roiled by

District representative of the National
Recreation Association.

tensions, discontent, and unhappiness,
if they are muddied by racial and relig-
ious bigotry, choked by dull, dreary lei-
sure—with no “living for the fun of
it”—how can they make any but that
kind of a contribution to the stream of
neighborhood and community living?

Dr. Paul Poponoe, one of the greatest
and wisest authorities on family rela-
tions, says, “Use of leisure time is an-
other key to successful family life. Many
a broken home might have been pre-
vented had husband and wife enjoyed a
reasonable amount of wholesome, inex-
pensive, constructive, and mutually-
shared recreation that broke the monot-
ony of daily work, gave them things to
think about and talk about together, and
satisfied the imperative human needs of
companionship, recognition, and self-
expression. . . Parents should give more
forethought to helping their young peo-
ple develop inner resources and learn
something about the almost lost art of
recreation, for which city life has sub-
stituted paid entertainment. Adequate
and satisfying recreation is essential at
any age, but vital after marriage.”

One of America’s foremost religious
leaders, Dr. Harry Emerson F osdick, in
a pamphlet he wrote for the National
Recreation Association, said: “Did you
ever stop to think that nothing beauti-
ful ever came into life until folks began
to play?

“The spirit of play, which is the.

crown of work and of home life, is also
the crown of religion.

“There is great satisfaction in life for
those who take it always in a sporting
spirit, for those ,who are living for the
fun of it.”

I see in all this a direct and inescap-
able challenge, particularly to leaders
and programs in the public recreation
field. Here recreation is an end in

John W. Faust

itself. At the same time, there is full
recognition and realization of the valid
attendant by-products of such programs
in the areas of education, health, con-
duct, social integration, and so on.
This is one of the most im i‘ortant
criteria in evaluating a commun 1y rec-
. other

y

reation program. Are we just
agency pulling the family apart? i There
are many agencies which do. Or do we,
by our programs, strengthen family ties
and solidarity both within and outside
the home? Do we add fun, sparkle, and
savor to family living?

Only recently, a young couple with
four small children asked me to their
home one evening to talk over a family
concern. It was: “How can we set up
competition to those agencies whose
programs pull our family apart? How
can we make our family life more al-
luring and satisfying?”

This is ust one example of an intense
longing on the part of parents for an-
swers to these questions. This was il-
lustrated overwhelmingly during my
twenty-one years of experience on the
board of the National Congress of Par-
ents and Teachers. As recreation chair-
man, I conducted hundreds of “fathers’
night” discussion groups and gave hun-
dreds of talks on family life, followed
by question periods. Nineteen out of
twenty times, when I was asked to lead
discussion, it was on some variation of
such topics as “The Spirit of Play in the
Home” or “Family Life—What Makes
it Tick.” These people, too, wanted to
know how to make family life more al-
luring.

An amusing confirmation of the long-
ing of parents for help was a telephone
invitation to talk to college women’s
clubs in five cities. Since practically all
members were mothers, I suggested a
talk on “Recreation and Family Life.”

RECREATION

 

There was a polite gasp on the phone,
“But we have been studying that as our
club program for two years with a pro-
fessor from the university!” When I ex-
plained that study and action are not
synonymous, my topic was eagerly ac-
cepted.

Over 350 women attended. I talked

briefly, and then came the questions—
for forty-five minutes—some hypothe-
tical, but an avalanche of personal ones.
This experience pointed up the short
circuit between study courses, books
and so on, and the building of a play
tradition in family living. It was evi-
. dent that only in few instances had the
“study program” resulted in action at

home.
Parents are confused as to where to

begin and how—in backyards, play-
grounds, indoor play rooms, workshOps,
or with books, equipment, supplies.
The crux of doing something about
family play, however, is the will to do
and “living for the fun of it” in all
family chores and relationships.

Books, facilities, and equipment have
their places and uses, but the resources
for beginning are in the hands of all
families — for example, the games,
songs, and stories parents enjoyed as
children, and those the children learn at
school. These, plus picnics, backyard
or afield, or dining together for one
meal a day are all a family needs to
begin, if they have the will to do so.
The public recreation department, li-
brary, museums, and other resources
can be used as family interest grows.

Too few departments are concerned
with the challenge and rare opportunity
for service to the foundations of com-
munity life—families. One department
answered the challenge in this manner.
Helped by the Parent-Teacher Associa-
tion Council, it secured the use of five
schools for a different night each week.
The superintendent of recreation em-
ployed seven part-time leaders with dif-
ferent skills—music, drama, arts, sh0p,
social recreation, dance, pre-school. The
families in each neighborhood were in-
vited to come to their own school for
the designated date. During the first
part of the evening they divided by age
and interests, under the supervision of
the seven leaders. But the climax—the
big pay-off—was the last forty-five min-
utes when all the dads and mothers and

MAY 1955

children came together in the gym for
community singing, social games, a
grand march and square dancing. You
never heard such laughter and merri-
ment, especially among the children at
seeing the elephantine antics of their
elders. Did something happen to those
families in those homes; to those neigh-
borhoods? It did .’ No statistics, true,
but it could be seen and felt.

In another city, family needs are met
in a variety of ways. Two years after
the recreation program was started, the
judge of the domestic (not juvenile)
relations court came up to me and said,
“My business has fallen off fifty per
For the first time in their lives
some mother and fathers have had a
chance to get away from the four walls
of the house, bellyaches and doctor’s
bills. They have been able to singvin a
chorus, play in a symphony, bowl,
dance, do crafts, and so on. They have
returned home looking more interesting
to their children and more alluring to
each other.”

We figured that the fifty per cent cut
was just over twice what the city spent
for the recreation program. This city
also held parents’ clinics on activities
for rainy days and Sunday afternoons,
for convalescents and shut-ins, for chil-
dren’s and family fun.

Another city prepared and publicized
bulletins on '-family party and picnic
programs, with directions for games
and other activities, and on how to build
a backyard fireplace for cook-outs and
picnics. They also made up party and
picnic loan kits for family use, with a
suggested list of activities.

Many cities have had backyard play-
ground contests with suggestions and
help to families. Others have had gar-
den contests and exhibits of hobbies.

Two women—both state P.T.A. rec-
reation chairmen, have made history in
their states. One made a drive for back-
yard fireplaces as focal points for out-
door family fun. In her third year her
twelve districts reported over 14,000
family picnics. She also urged setting
up a mother-daughter “studio corner”
in the home—to match the father-son
workbench—where items for home dec-
oration and beautification and gifts
could be created.

The other woman, who had been a
play leader before her marriage, took

cent.

her own and a neighboring family to
the state’s educational radio studio one
night a week and put on a family play
night. She became famous as “The
Games Lady” in homes throughout the
state. TV has opened up unlimited pos-
sibilities in this area.

In evolving a family life_ where situa-
tions are deftly handled with a relaxed
and smiling touch, where there is laugh-
ter and gaiety, and where molehills re-
main molehills, no vehicle surpasses the
social period of the evening meal. In
the largess of its parental and family
rewards, it stands just after Christmas

and Thanksgiving.

Just st0p a minute—flash your mind
back to your own youth. What stands
out and makes you smile? I’ll wager
that one thing is the warmth and fun
around the table at suppertime. There
is no occasion in family living so rich
in possibilities for weaving back and
forth those tiny invisible silver threads
which bind the family together as a unit
—-— whether actually together or far
apart. Here, where love and laughter,
humor and understanding reign, are
laid those deep unseen foundations but-
tressing the emotional stability and the
benign social integration of our chil-
dren. And don’t say this is Victorian
and can’t be done in the fast tempo of
modern civilization. It is being done in

thousands of homes throughout the
land.

The programs of far too many excel-
lent national, state, and local public and
private agencies serving all ages are
pulling the family apart. One national
agency, recognizing this, has begun, I
am told, an eXperimental family pro-
gram. But who is equipped with better
tools and techniques for the recreational
use of leisure time per se, who is in a
more advantageous position to swing
into action on it, than qualified leaders
in the public recreation field?

Let’s lay hold on it, and actually do
more about it!

There are two lines in an old gospel
hymn of my youth which put it neatly:

“Lay hold on life and let it be,
Thy joy and crown eternally.”

Swimming Pools Series

Sirs:

I have certainly enjoyed reading your
article on outdoor swimming pools in
the January and February issues and I
have found that the various recreation
directors with whom I have talked have
taken special note Of these articles and
are quoting from them to their commis-
sions. The articles have certainly cre-

. ated a great deal of interest.

Playground Equipment Boxes

Sirs:
We built a sturdy wooden box for

storing p l a y g r o u n d equipment out- '

doors, but within a few years the boys
were tearing it apart; therefore, I would
advise a metal one. Packing-material

the material of which they are made is
heavy enough, these might be used.

Park and Recreation Conference

Sirs:

The third training institute of the
Mid-Continent Regional Park and Rec-
reation Conference, held in conjunction
with the University Of Minnesota Con-
tinuation Center, was very successfully
received. There was an attendance of
more than one hundred delegates from
Canada, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minne-
sota. This three-day meeting covered all
facets of the park and recreation field
and included some inspiring talks by
outstanding speakers.

The facilities and appointments at the
Continuation Center again proved ideal
for such a training institute, and the
comments of the delegates indicated
their interest in such kinds of meetings.

Recreation and Adult Education

Sirs:

Malcolm Knowles does the field a
service in his article in your February

problem of definition and differentia-
tion of specialities in the education and
recreation fields. I am a bit disappoint-
ed, however, in his optimism concerning
the future merger of adult education

RECREATION

 

 

and recreation. I am not so sure that
adult education has to be “recreational-
ly” palatable, nor that recreation must
include educational objectives.

Recreation, in its essence, functions
to restore autonomy to the individual
whether this autonomy be psychologi-
cal, physiological, or social in nature.
To accomplish this feat, it takes many
avenues. At times it may be heavily
structured. Contrarily, the individual'
trout fisherman may be reconstituting
his personality very much alone on
some frosty morning as he drops bait
into a swirling pool. Likewise, the spon-
taneous aspect of recreation, its enthusi-
asms and aesthetic appreciations are not
tied to educational concerns.

Adult education, on the other hand,
must address itself to a citizenry which
is very mobile, complex, ambivalent,
and often uninformed. Increased re-
sponsibilities sit astraddle the shoulders
of him who would be responsible and
confidently competent in today’s hurly-
burly society. The changing demands
of tomorrow often make futile our un-
derstandings and techniques of yester-
day. This, it seems to me, is the charge
to adult education. Without such deep
concerns adult education is but a fluffy
preoccupation with conveniently satis-
fying and enjoyable, individualistic ac-
tivities. '

I like Mr. Knowles’ referenceto the
“highest enjoyment of all, the enjoy-
ment of self-improvement.” The difli-f
culty, however, appears to lie in the fact
that such enjoyment is usually retro-
spective in nature. One does not always
love the practice involved in achieving
musicianship, nor the midnight oil
burned over the years in ceremonious
dedication to the hallowedness of ad-
vanced degrees! Recreation, on the
other hand, is a here-and-now satisfac-
tion; tangible, alive, real, and immedi-
ately enjoyed.

For these reasons, I believe that we
need to differentiate rather than merge
recreation and adult education, in ad-
dition to seeing the blessings of each.

tor of the Division of Group Work
and Recreation, George Williams

Sirs:

I was delighted to read the editorial,
“Recreation and Adult Education” by
Malcolm S.‘ Knowles. It has been my
belief for some time that these two fields
were inseparable. In fact, for over a
year now the recreation department has
sponsored an adult class in parent-child
relations, and we hope in the future to
offer more classes in various subjects

for adults. Recreation, it seems to me,
is definitely an area of education even
for the children and other youngsters
who participate in the program. With
this view in mind, it would not seem to
me that we could take the education out
of recreation for adults. I would like
to hear views from other recreation per-
sonnel.

Recreation Congress Issue carrying a
Congress section which will include: an
article on what to see and do in the city
of Denver—and on the way there; last
minute news about the big meeting; a
listing of commercial exhibitors; and
so on.

In addition, this issue will again em-

proposed budget, which covers the fiscal
year starting July 1, are now being held.
It must be approved by May 21. This
budget allocates the department of

nile delinquency, sponsored by the Wel-

fare and Health Council of New York
City, 44 E. 23rd Street, New York City.
Participating were twenty-five psychi-
atric and other professional leaders.
The conferees recommended that study
of child conflict and maladjustment
should be coordinated with action, not
only in clinics and welfare agencies, but
also in the home, the school and the
community. It has been announced that
a full report will be published within
the next few months.

swers to the following questions: Have
any studies been made nationally con-
cerning recreational roller-skating pro-
grams and liability insurance for the
same? Could some effort be made to
make such a study? What reports are
available as to the hazard and risks in-

We me We {a mmce~
An International Recreation Congress

ONCE AGAIN the recreation, play, and
leisure-time forces of the world
will be brought together in an Interna-
tional Recreation Congress at Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., October 1,
1956.

The First International Recreation
Congress was held in Los Angeles in
1932, just prior to the Olympic Games
‘of that year. Herbert Hoover, while
President of the United States, was hon-
orary president of the congress. A dis-
tinguished international a'dvisory com-
mittee sponsored it and helped in its
planning.

A Second International Recreation
Congress was then scheduled for Berlin
in 1936 and was turned over to the Ger-
man committee for organizing in ac-
cordance with the principle adopted of
giving responsibility to the host country
each time. Subsequent deve10pments
in the international situation, however,
caused the National Recreation Assoc-
iation of the United States of America
to withdraw from participating in the
congress in Germany in 1936 and in

Italy in 1938. .
Immediately following World War II

various groups began to urge that an in-
ternational recreation congress again
be held. Frequently it has been suggest-
ed that the congress be related to the
Olympics, the United Nations, and other
movements and institutions.

In the meantime, the concept of rec-
reation has become more widely under-
stood throughout the world. An increas-
ing number of inquiries have come
from foreign countries. Visitors to our
ofiice have eXpressed deep interest in
the recreation movement as they have
observed it here. The wide-spread con-
cern of the American peOple generally,
in the international situation, and the
ready acceptance of the value of techni-
cal assistance of all kinds to underde-
velOped countries, were some of the fac-
tors which have made the reviving of an

international recreation congress de-
sirable.

October 1-5, 1956

Leaders in the field of recreation in
America have also become convinced
that the field of recreation has a real
contribution to make to international
understanding and that a privately or-
ganized and privately sponsored effort

_to bring together leaders from other

lands to discuss enriched living through
recreation could have values far beyond
those accruing to the recreation profes-
sion alone.

There is a wide range of programs in
other lands for individual community
deveIOpment— which here in America
come under the general term “recrea-
tion.” For purposes of the International
Recreation Congress we use this term
to cover many of the programs that in

EXCHANGE OF
RECREATION LEADERS

A group of t0p level leaders
from all parts of the world respon-
sible for parks, recreation, youth
service, and related programs for
the peOple will be brought to
America under the Exchange of
Persons Program in June, 1956
for a four-month study and ob-
servation of the recreation move-
ment under the proposed plan.

They will be sponsored by the
International Recreation Service
of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation and will be guests of local
recreation departments. At the
close of their study they will at-
tend the International Recreation
Congress at Philadelphia.

Any other foreign visitors who are in
America on one of the various exchange
of persons programs—public or private
——who may have an interest in this im-
portant aspect of American life will be
welcome to attend the International
Recreation Congress at Philadelphia.

other lands are carried on under vari-
ous headings including parks, play-
grounds, commUnity centers, clubs, rec-
reation and group work, informal edu-
cation, p0pular education, youth serv-
ice, and adult education. In terms of ac-
tivities we are thinking of music, drama,
games, sports, crafts, camping, nature,
and hobbies of various kinds carried
on for personal satisfaction and devel-
opment.

The National Recreation Association
has, therefore, accepted the responsibil-
ity for calling and organizing an Inter-
national Recreation Congress in 1956
and the International Recreation Serv-
ice of the Association, 'along with its
expanded program of service to other
lands, will provide the executive leader-
ship for the congress which is to be or-
ganized separate from any other move-
ment or institution, but which will wel-
come 000peration and assistance from
all who are interested in this broad field
of human service.

Philadelphia seems particularly ap-
propriate for this meeting, both for his-
torical and modern reasons. Here the
Declaration of Independence took place.
Here man’s right to the pursuit of hap-
piness was proclaimed. Today Philadel-
phia, after years of struggle for a com-
prehensive public recreation service, en-
visions and has taken steps to bring
about a notable program of recreation
services for all its peOple. So here, in
the cradle of American freedom, lead-
ers from other lands will join together
to exchange information and experience
on how leisure can be used for life en-
richment through recreation.

. The congress will also have signifi-
cance for the American recreation
movement because 1956 is the fiftieth
anniversary of the founding of the Na-
tional Recreation Association.

We shall welcome suggestions from
all on how this congress can best serve
the recreation needs of peOple every-
where.——~T. E. RIVERS, Executive Secre-
tary, International Recreation Service.

llllllllllll'llllll or Families

In its most meaningful, creative and grow-

ing sense, it has much to offer families today.

THIS TOPIC probably evokes in the reader a strange mix-
ture of memories and emotions. Some will think of pop-
ping corn and eating apples in a Grandma Moses’ Christ-
mas card setting. Some will think of Sunday afternoon
rides, engineered by father, endured by mother, enjoyed by
the children, and resented by the teen-ager. Some will be re-
minded of “every Thursday night at the ‘Y’,” when the
craft materials are left out “for family fun”—and nobody
comes. Others will recall birthday parties, anniversaries,
family reunions, or—what do you do with a mixed age
group?

As are all areas of family living, recreation is loaded with
emotions, feelings, hidden meanings. For that reason it is
of more than passing significance. Wherever our profes-
sional niche may be, as professionals it is appropriate to
ask ourselves frequently exactly what meaning our work,
our plans, our programs have for others. It is especially
urgent that we raise such questions with reference to the
families who make up the communities where we live and
work. What are we doing to them in our efforts to do [or
them?

If recreation is truly [or families, what is it like?

1. If recreation is for families, it fits the family and the
persons involved. Jean Shick Grossman relates how a soft-
spoken, unschooled mother in a settlement house parents’
group remarked simply, “If you want a child to practice the
piano, you should first find out if he’s fittable for music.”
Some of us, in our eagerness to be able to list “number of
participants” or “number of activities carried out,” over-do
our doing good. We try to get everyone in the community or
in the family to do the same thing in the same way at the
same time. However, when or as we do that, we should ap-
propriately change the label from recreation to regimenta-
tion.

When recreation fits the family it becomes a real and vital
part of everyday living, not something crowded in as an

Home Economics, The Pennsylvania State University.

William M. Smith, Jr.

afterthought, something elaborate and unrelated to the rest
of living. In a family, moods pass-from one member to an-
other by contagion. When one becomes carefree, happy,
relaxed, he finds his feelings reflected in those about him.
This process can go on regardless of the specific activity in
which the family is engaged provided that members are in-
teracting with one another. At least part of the time rec-
reation should stimulate or promote interaction.

Periodicals and how-to-do-it books are filled with plans
and suggestions for activities which are too frequently more
appropriate for the well-equipped craft shop than for family
recreation. [Simple crafts projects and other adaptable and
carry-over activities can, however, be introduced to family
group members in a recreation department program which
is so planned.—Ed.]. An activity with family-appeal should
offer a variety of different things to do so that each family
member can use his skills and talents, modest or ambitious.

Going on a picnic is such an activity. Picking up sticks
for a fire is not age-graded. Neither are many of the other
activities incidental to meal preparation outdoors. Planning
and constructing an outdoor fireplace or other play equip-
ment falls in the same category. So does the making of
Christmas cards and holiday decorations. From beginning
to end everyone can have a hand in the goings-on if he so

chooses. Fitting the family also brings up the question of ’

the costs of recreation in time, energy, and money. Costs
should be seen in relation to all of the other areas of a fam-
ily’s daily living. Mother-daughter skating lessons adver-
tised in the paper sound like fun, but it might be that the
time schedule obviously suits the teacher, not the families
whose members are in school or at work through the day.

2. If recreation is for families, it leaves room for priv-
acy. If there is any place in this cluttered-up world of ac-
tivity where a person can find some opportunity for quiet
rest it should be his home. We spend so much of our time
doing that we need some leisure just to be.

Recreation for the family is not activity alone. Just being
together, each person lost in his own thoughts, may be a
recreational experience. Our son, at age half-past-three,

RECREATION

 

Parents are enjoying watching their children at play. A bap-
py, relaxed mood is passed on from one member of the family
to another; this feeling cannot be crowded in as afterthought.

used to say, “Sunday is the ‘funnest’ day in the week. It’s
fun when we’re together. On that day we’re all home to-
gether and we eat together, and we go for a ride together.”
In planning for recreation in families it is important to
leave time for private, personal use. So many organizations
are now family-centered, or claim to be, that the family it-
self has discovered its privacy invaded. Four scout meet-
ings, four Sunday school parents’ meetings, and four PTA
meetings get to be quite a dose. With each child in the
family this type of participation is multiplied and cuts into
free time as well as family time. At a Scout court of honor
recently, one of the leaders asking for volunteers empha-
sized that the fathers have more fun than the boys, that he
used to spend one night a week in scout work, now some-
times spends six. How much is left for the family’s private
world if one or two members go out every night in the week?

3. Recreation for families helps individuals get a new
lease on life. To hold interest in life and to make the best
of our own personal and family emotional resources we need
to get away from our jobs once in a while, to gain perspec-
tive. Many of us achieve this or try to do so through some
form of recreation. Some find wreck—creation instead. We
work so hard at our bridge that we are diHicult to live with.

It has been said that since we have homes today that work
well, we need to give more attention to homes that play well.
After all, a child does not begin with a distinction between
work and play. That is an attitude which we adults teach
him—from our own storehouse of prejudices. We teach
children that it is good to work but a waste of time to play;
so we have masses of adults who are recreationally illiterate,
throwing away millions of dollars in trying to buy happi-
ness, and full of guilt feelings because they play. We have

MAY 1955

heard persons apologize for spending
an evening folk dancing because they
did not have anything “to show for it.”
They considered it an unproductive ac-
tivity.

As individuals we need to learn to
take some things lightly rather than giv-
ing equally serious attention to all mat-
ters. When troubles come, when tem-
pers rise, it may be the best prescription
in the book to get away for a while in
another activity, so that we may return
to look at things from another angle.
This does not mean that we use play as
an escape, to change the subject, to
avoid responsibility. A recreation ex-
perience is more than an escape. It
strengthens us for tackling problems
that face us. Riding a hobby horse fre-
quently gives us such a pick-up. From
that saddle, the world can look brighter.

4. Recreation for families builds 15e-
lationships. It is at this point that some of us who are con-
cerned about human relationships in and outside of the fam-
ily feel that recreation has so much to contribute, and some-
times has missed the ball. Here are some examples:

The children come home breathlessly from a morning at
the tot lot with the news, “We’re going to have a pet show
tomorrow. Can I take my goldfish? Can I take my dog?
Can I, huh?” The family is all drawn into the excitement;
—and then later, a committee of mothers is asked to judge
the “best pet.” Now who can face the doleful eyes of her
own child as she points out some other entry as “best”?
And who can say that the tears of a four-year-old are worth
that day or event? Learning to be good losers? There are
more appropriate and more timely ways to learn or to teach
that lesson—without spoiling a day for the families.

Another example comes from a community which opens
a gymnasium to the town’s small fry during vacations. In-
stead of directing some group games or helping the chil-
dren see how many different and new ways they might have
fun, the adults set child against child in competitive events
where only a few can win. Mothers and fathers have to
spend the next week consoling the majority of the partici-
pants who did not win and did not get their names and faces
in the paper.

But recreation can build relationships—when son beats
father at checkers and finds that dad thought it a good game
anyway—h—when the whole family plays canasta and the ten-
year-old discovers that the eight-year-old “brat” sister also
knows how to score—when the children come home with
“new” folksongs which mother and dad sang twenty-five
years ago and can learn again in a new arrangement—in
dozens of ways, recreation can, and does, build relationships.

5. Recreation for families lasts throughout the cycle of
family life. The professional recreation worker would not
label play “for children only,” but some communities appear
to do so. In families, however, recreation makes one more

FUN Without Tears

EMILY HOSKINS startled the parents’
group which was discussing recre-
ation and the difficulty of finding things
that the whole family could do together.
“We don’t have much trouble that way,”
she announced. “We don’t try to do any-
thing planned ust for the children.”

“But you have to,” one of the group
remonstrated. “It’s your duty. All the
experts say so.”

“Oh, we tried it,” said Emily, “but
we found it just didn’t work. When the
children were small we played dreary
little games with pointers and counters
that were supposed to be chickens and
bunnies. But pretty soon Don would be-
gin to yawn, and I’d start to think about
something else, and the children would
be fighting about whose turn it was be-
cause we lost track. Later we tried
counting and spelling games, but those
were no good either. If we got ahead of
the children they pouted, and if we held
back they acted as if we were insulting
them and accused us of not really try-
ing. The trips that everyone said were
good for them were usually flops. For
one thing, they wouldn’t pay attention
to the marvels and wonders they were
supposed to observe and we felt our
efforts had gone for nothing. When we
got home we were tired and cross. But
since we’ve stopped trying, we’re all
having a wonderful time.”

The Family Makes the Fun

most of us would admit that, at times,
we face up to family recreation as a

Real fun—the contagious kind—is a built-in part of com-
panionable family living and not a separate department.

 

r 7' ‘ :s  ., .13 .

“My daughter whooshes away on
her paper,” says a father, of a
joint fingerpainting effort, “and
I whoosh on mine, and we like
it!” Try it with your own children.

chore rather than a pleasure. Like ath-
letes that are overtrained, we tend to
press a little in our eagerness to give our
children everything that is good. We
have been made too self-conscious about
something that can be an integral part
of family life, rather than an elaborate
and separate adjunct.

The families that care~ greatly about
the children’s happiness are usually
those where being a part of the family
group is in itself a unique pleasure. It
means being a privileged member of a
closed circle, with access to a private
store of okes, allusions with special
meanings, and delicious secrets. It en-
titles one to group support and free ad-
mission to group events. Above all, it
provides a haven where one is accepted
at face value, with no strings attached.

But this, one might object, is not fun;
this is only part of family life. What,
then, do we mean by “fun”? Hilarity?

Entertainment? Or do we mean more

inclusively the good moments in life?

If we agree that the latter constitutes
“fun” we can see that family fun is an
almost inescapable accompaniment to
the family state itself. No group can
live intimately together, with tolerance
and goodafellowship, without sharing
some of the pleasurable aspects of life.

We know a father who admits frankly
that he enjoys using his pre-school
daughter’s fingerpaints. “It’s fun to
whoosh that stuff around,” he says.
“She whooshes on her paper and I
whoosh on mine, and we like it!”

During the time he spends away from
home, this father is a hard-working
partner in a grocery store. The activity
he chooses to share with his child is the
very thing that would be a fine aid to
relaxation for him under any circum-
stances, but his daughter offers him an
impeccable excuse to indulge in it. And
because it is good for him, and not
something he does just to please her, it
forms a genuine bond between them.

Under the overlay of duties and obli-
gations, we all carry within us a corner
of childhood that waits quietly to be
recognized, offering in return the gift
of well-being and serenity. For the joys
of childhood are in their essence time-
less. We do not lose them or outgrow
them, although we may turn away from
them.

When it comes to finding projects
which hold equal values for both sexes
and several ages, it is best to forget con-
ventional patterns 'and let our inclina-
tions steer us. The only essential is that
these activities should offer a variety
of things to do, so that each person can

213

find his niche and use his own skills,
big or small.

One family we know found their proj-
ect through the ownership of a dog. A
whole new world of interest and con-
tacts opened up to this family. The idea
of entering Laurie in competition with
others of his breed gave the children a
definite objective to aim for, and they
found trimming and training more fas-
cinating than movies. Weekends were
not long enough to contain all their new
activities—learning how to “handle” a
dog in the showing, finding out about
the “points” the judges looked for, ex-
ercising the dog so that he would be in
good condition for his showing. The
money saved on movies paid for the
entry fees and the whole family was
filled with pleasant excitement.

Other families of this kind shared

pleasure in renovating an old home;

still others take to square danclng.
Parents and children who have a com-
mon interest in nature are lucky, of
course; but it may be a passion for
Scrabble or kite flying (this, by the way,
is practically a new sport since flexible
kites came on the market) that really
rouses enthusiasm. The main point is to
start with the “urge” and not with a
blueprint of something “worthwhile”
which just doesn’t happen to appeal to
any member of the family.

Modern parents tend to underesti-
mate themselves. They are so intent on
what the children need that they often
overlook what they themselves have to
give. We have become too humble.

The mother who reads poetry to her
children because she loves it is inviting
them to participate in the most precious
pleasure she knows. This is also true of
the parent who loves to cook, or the one

for whom the product of his hands rep-
resents the essence of enjoyment. And
if this sharing is offered freely, as an
invitation and not a command, the chil-
dren will be tempted at least to ex-
plore it.

Let us repeat that if an invitation is
to create a real community of spirit, it
must remain exactly that, open to ac-
ceptance or refusal. Little pleasure lies
in any eXperience that must be suffered
against our will. This works both ways.
The parent who feels driven, compelled,
forced to participate in a family event
contributes more by staying away.
These are the separate undertakings
that should be done only by those who
are interested, or by one member of the

Down in the corner of this page is Denver’s famous Buckin’ Bronco. Him an' his rider
sorta typify this seCtion for some folks, same as the mountains do for others. Better
make plans for the Congress—September 27 to October 1—and have a rarin' good time.

THE FIRST evening session of the Denver Recreation Con-
gress will be addressed by Dr. A. S. Raubenheimer, edu-
cational vice-president of the University of Southern Cali-
fornia. His general theme will be the creative aspects of our
recreation programs.

Dr. Raubenheimer was born in South Africa where he was
graduated from the University of the Cape of Good Hope,
and he received his master’s degree from the University of
Cape Town before coming to the United States. He taught
at Columbia and Stanford Universities before joining the
faculty at Southern California in 1923. He has served there
as professor of educational psychology and dean of the Col-
lege of Letters, Arts, and Sciences before becoming educa-
tional vice-president in 1946.

An unusually effective and thoughtful speaker, Dr. Raub-
enheimer has especially impressed those who have heard
him speak on recreation subjects in general and their crea-
tive aspects in particular. So much interest in the creative
aspects of our recreation programs was generated at St.
Louis that it seemed appropriate to continue the considera-
tion of this important topic at Denver.

Those who at St. Louis had the opportunity to meet Dr.
Frederick Hall, chairman of the department of music at Ala-
bama State College, will rejoice at news that he will play a
return engagement at the Congress at Denver. Dr. Hall was
extremely successful in his demonstrations of “action spir-
ituals,” and his work illustrates well the thrill of creating

MAY 1955

something new and different, in his case by linking move-
ment with the singing of spirituals.

Dr. Hall’s demonstration is only one of several being
planned for the Denver Congress program. It is hoped that
demonstrations in such fields as arts and crafts, social rec-
reation, and drama will continue to be part of the week’s
schedule. New, this year, will be a demonstration of a bowl-
ing school, which will be conducted for Congress delegates
by the National Bowling Council. At least two other demon-
strations are in the planning stage, both in areas new to the
Congress.

Delegates are urged to arrange hotel reservations early.
Requests should be sent to the Denver Convention and Visi-
tors’ Bureau, 225 West Colfax, Denver. For further infor-
mation see RECREATION for April, page 152, and the Con-
gress preliminary program. If you have not received your

FAMILIES PLAY

in

TATE PARKS

State park planners in Kentucky are thinking in terms of more recreation

facilities for the family group and of planned family-recreation programs.

MORE AND MORE American families are participating in
the out-of-door forms of recreation; and this trend can
be clearly seen in Kentucky’s state parks where facilities for
recreation have been expanded greatly during the past few
years to satisfy demands of visitors. This increasing desire
on the part of families to enjoy recreation as a group has
had its influence on Kentucky’s park planners who have
learned to keep the family in mind at all times when making
improvements or adding to park recreation facilities.

During the past six years, the state has invested more than
$7,000,000 in capital‘ outlay improvements at state parks,
much of this amount going toward improvement of old and
construction of new facilities. During the 1953-54 fiscal year
several large projects offering family-use possibilities have
been completed and family vacationing has taken an up-
ward swing that should become increasingly noticeable dur-
ing the coming vacation season.

Heed has also been given to those families who prefer to
rough it on their vacations, enjoying the advantages derived
from tent camping. There are now five state parks offering
spacious areas for camping in the more rustic areas within
park limits. Although these areas provide an opportunity
for real out-of-door living they also offer conveniences such
as tables, outdoor ovens, running water, showers and rest
rooms. Park officials found that tent camping has become
so p0pular in Kentucky, however, that special permission
to camp is granted in most of the parks without improved
facilities, and future plans call for additional tent-campsite
development and improvement to existing areas.

Along the same lines, special attention has been given to
improvement and extension of hiking trails and picnic areas.
Miles of trails were laid out and marked after it was found
that hiking played an important part in family recreation.

Picnic facilities are now available in all of the state parks
and, especially on weekends during the summer, the areas
are visited heavily by families from surrounding larger
cities wishing to get away from everyday surroundings and
forget about city living, even if just for a day.

Acceding to the family vacation trend, and requests for a
choice of activities for both young and old, many state parks
now have special playgrounds for the youngsters, and, in
those parks containing swimming facilities, there has been
set aside special enclosed wading areas to insure the chil-

dren’s safety while older members of the family enjoy more
advanced water sports. Tennis, badminton and shuffleboard
courts are in constant use by families, and the state has con-
structed and maintains docks for boating and fishing. There
are horses for riding enthusiasts, and one of the larger parks
on Kentucky Lake offers an eighteen-hole golf course.

Two of the parks, Natural Bridge and Cumberland Falls,
are the most advanced in program. Both parks offer the
entire family group the opportunity to participate in early
morning bird watches and in nature walks conducted by a
naturalist who is usually a student majoring in zoology or
botany. Both parks also offer guided tours to points of nat-
ural interest and, in the evening, square dances are con-
ducted. Free movies, including cartoons for the children,
are featured at Cumberland Falls, Natural Bridge, and at
Kentucky Dam Village; and during the past several years
the Little Theatre group at Murray State College and the
Pioneer Playhouse cast of Danville present plays during the
summer at Cumberland Falls and Kentucky Dam Village.

In planning recreation programs along family lines, Ken-
tucky park of‘ticials, headed by Conservation Commissioner
Henry Ward, also realized that in order to enable these
groups to vacation in the parks and take advantage of these
developments, prices charged must be pegged to the family
budget but still be in line with private vacation resorts in
each area. This has been done, and a family, vacationing
at any of Kentucky’s state parks, expects to pay a nominal
price for services and accommodations.

Expressing satisfaction with the increased use of park
recreation facilities by family groups, Mr. Ward announced
only recently that much of the $430,000 voted to the park
system for the coming year will be used to shift the empha-
sis from major accommodations construction to increased
recreation opportunities. He said, “The great majority of
persons who enjoy the state parks are Kentuckians who do
not have access to other parks. EXperience has shown that
they like the picnicking, swimming, boating, and the other
recreation facilities provided in state parks.”

Proof that this state park program is paying off is found
in park attendance figures showing that an estimated 3,573,-
000 persons, many families included, visited the state’s
twenty-four parks and shrines during the 1953-54 fiscal year.
The current figure is almost ten times the estimated attend-
ance at state parks in 1947-48 when the expanded recreation
facilities and living accommodations program was started.

The number of visitors to state parks for that year was
373,589.

Rehearsal of the Denver Civic Band, one of the many
groups playing a part in the city-wide music program.

The excellent, community-wide music program in
Denver, Colorado, is well-known. Delegates to the
37th National Recreation Congress in that city will
find this program well worth investigating.

ON THE PREMISE that music is everyone’s birthright, and
that it is not a luxury but a necessity to a happy way
of life, the municipal music program in Denver—Hone phase
‘of the total recreation program—provides opportunities for
adults to participate in the fields of choral and instrumental
music for purposes of recreation, relaxation, and education.
With these ideals in mind, the objectives sought are twofold:
to supplement, not supplant, existing music opportunities
in the city; and to provide more and better music for more
peOple through both participation and listening for pleasure.

The program is geared to adult or postgraduate needs be-
cause Denver is fortunate in having a fine music-education
program in the public schools, where nearly one youngster
out of six—approximately twelve thousand children—takes
an active part in the school music program. This includes
bands, orchestras, choruses, and piano classes. Music, there-
fore, from the elementary grades through high school, is
being well taken care of in the schools. For the city to en-
gage in junior- and youth-group musical activities would,
in our case, be over-servicing an already excellent program.

Hence the line of demarcation in our municipal music pro-
gram. It is hoped, by this method of “carry-over” after
high school, that the citizen’s tax-dollar will be used to full-
est advantage for the continuation of music education after
high school and college. From a recent survey, at least one
Denverite in eight—or more than sixty thousand pcrsons—
was engaged in some form of musical activity in 1954.

ROBERT SMITH, pianist and organist, is the coordinator of
music for the City and County of Denver, Colorado.

218

At present there are eight adult organizations in the
Denver Municipal Musical Association: six choruses, a
string orchestra and a symphonic band. Each group re-
hearses two hours each week during the school year, Sep-
tember to June.

Membership is open to all citizens of the City and County
of Denver and a one dollar membership fee is set for all
organizations. It is felt that this fee, set at the request and
approval of the members, would give the participant the
feeling of belonging to the organization. Anyone who can-
not afiord the fee is given free membership. (To date no one
has asked for this.) Directors and accompanists are en-
gaged for each organization on a part-time basis and are
selected from the public schools, local universities, music

‘-

teachers, and musicians.

A feature of the recreation program in the Mile High City
is the close cooperation and coordination of the public
schools and the municipality—in athletics, social work, cen-
ter work, and in music. Through the courtesy of the board
of education of the Denver public schools, all the municipal
musical organizations are permittcd free use of special
music rooms and cquipment, choral and instrumental, in the
public schools. Again the taXpayer’s dollar is spread farther.

After rehearsals one must think of performances, and in
our program all organizations prcpare for individual ap-
pearances, under the respective directors, at hospitals, musi-
cal societies, church and civic organizations, and during
Music chk. Massed performances, directcd by the coor-
dinator, are given at Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving.
All pcrforlnances are free to thc public.

A twelve-week radio and television series, featuring all
groups, was completed last year and another series has been
arranged for this season. All public concert performances
are taped for radio broadcasts at later dates. h

For the massed choral performances, )The Messiah,
Elijah, and other large choral works, a full professional or-
chestra is used through the cooperation and assistance of
the American Federation of Musicians Local 20, through
its music performance trust fund. For each massed per-
formance a small vocal festival is held, and fifty to sixty
singers audition. The soloists are selected by a neutral panel
of udges, who are usually faculty members from the music
departments of Colorado universities and colleges.

A music library is being established and more than three
thousand dollars has been expended this past year for music,
choral and instrumental. Each director selects his own mu-
sic, which ranges from folk music to Bach, Brahms, Vaughan
Williams, Roy Harris and Randall Thompson.

Come summertime, music takes to the open-air, and for
six weeks, six nights per week, the Denver Municipal Band
performs at City Park. This is a fully professional band of
forty union musicians, and its popularity may be udged by
the fact that it attracted approximately 265,000 listeners to
its concerts last summer.

In cooperation with the music department and health edu-
cation department of the Denver public schools, an eight-
week recreational music program for beginning, intermedi-
ate, and advanced bands and orchestras is conducted dur-
ing the summer vacation. This proved very popular last
year with over two thousand young =musicians participating.

As a public service, and as a meansof-further publicizing
the program, a short, thirty- to forty-five-minute program
called “Music Can Be Fun” has been presented to date to
some seven hundred groups. These groups are comprised of
civic clubs, churches of all denominations and faiths,
P.T.A.’s, schools, colleges, trade and labor organizations,
professional associations, and conventions—state, regional,

u‘

Civic choral group. All of these public concerts are tape-
recorded for radio rebroadcast at some future occasion.

 

and natlonal. This program always includes audience par-
ticipation in the form of community singing and has in-
cluded somewhat over 300,000 participants. This is a truly
wonderful means of public relations.

Through the courtesy and cooperation of all newspapers
in the Rocky Mountain region, and in particular the Denver
Post and the Rocky Mountain News, coverage of the pro-
gram, all concerts, and special events has been excellent.
The ten radio and four television stations have also given of
their time, for publicity and program, as a public service.

The program and special activities are announced in the
bulletins of the Denver public schools, in all P.T.A. monthly
bulletins, and in the monthly publications of the Denver
Council of Churches. The Adult Education Council carries
all activities in their bi-monthly publication, W hat’s On in
Denver, and program information is sent to all large busi-
nesses and stores for display on their personnel bulletin
boards.

To assist in the planning and guidance of the municipal
music program, the mayor of Denver established the
Mayor’s Advisory Music Committee. It is composed of
local civic leaders, representing all races, colors, and creeds
in the city of Denver. Its chairman is the director of music
education for the Denver public schools.

Music Week

The Mayor’s Advisory Music Committee sponsors Music
Week in cooperation with the Denver public schools. This
year our program will include the following musical events,
which are free to the public:

First Day. Evening concerts in all senior high school au-
ditoriums, featuring choruses, bands, and orchestras and
having approximately two thousand five hundred partici-
pants in all.

Second Day. Evening song fest at Denver University,
featuring choral groups from all fraternities, sororities, and
clubs, in a choral contest.

Third Day. Evening concert in City Auditorium by pa-
rochial school musical organizations with approximately
two thousand students participating.

Fourth Day. Afternoon concert in City Auditorium by
elementary public school students, with approximately six
thousand students participating. Evening concert of sacred
music in City Auditorium, sponsored by the Denver Coun-
cil of Churches and featuring a massed chorus of approxi-
mately one thousand voices.

Fifth Day. Evening concert in City Auditorium by unior
high school students; band, orchestra and chorus, with ap-
proximately three thousand five hundred participating.

Sixth Day. Evening concert in City Auditorium by mu-
nicipal music groups, featuring the symphonic band and
string orchestra.

Seventh Day. Evening concert in City Auditorium featur-
ing the six municipal choruses. '

During the week all civic clubs will have a musical pro-
gram—instrumental, vocal and/or choral—and it is hoped
by the end of the week’s events some fifteen thousand
students and adults will have participated actively in Music

Week 1955.

Recreation in
CHRRECTIHNAL INSTITUTIIINS

“It is a distinct part of the correctional process.”

Every man profits by, or is the victim
of, his environment. Environment is the
sum total of the forces, physical, intel-
lectual, and cultural, immediately sur-
rounding and impinging upon the whole
personality.

This is as true of the special, and in
many-ways peculiar, atmosphere of the
correctional institution as of free soci-
ety. Indeed, perhaps environment plays
a more direct and immediate role in the
restrictive latitude of the institution
than it does in the outside community.
The intensity of social contacts in the
monotonous regimentation inherent in
institutionalization tends to make the
individual more sensitive to the minutia
of his environment.

Granting this, everything that hap-
pens to a man in prison has an impor-
tant part in shaping his personality—
his work, his physical surroundings, his
officers, his fellow inmates, and his lei-
sure-time activities. Hence “recreation——
organized and supervised recreation——
has as much effect upon the mutation of
the individual, upon his objective in-
sight into his own predicament, as work
habits or schooling or anything else he
may experience in the institution.

To look upon recreation as a stopgap
measure —- a means of utilizing idle
hours as a substitute for productive
work and educational endeavors—is,

sification and Education, Department

on the other hand, as much of a viola-
tion of sound penological practices as is
the complete absence of a well-rounded,
organized recreation program. To use
recreation as an opiate in attempting to
control incarcerated persons tends to
produce a corpulent inmate body whose
lethargy, upon release, extends into the
community and creates a social attitude
of indifference, dependency, and imma-
turity. Too much free time, organized
or not, tends to become destructive
rather than serving as a respite and re-
juvenation.

Historically, institutions for the of-
fenders have been plagued by the lack
of meaningful work for inmates, and,
unfortunately, the administrator in his
attempt to find some activity has at
times been forced to rely upon sports
and just plain “yard” to fill some of the
gap made by the dearth of work. Herein
lies a peculiar difference between the
public recreation agency and the recre-
ation department within a correctional
institution; for again, historically, rec-
reation in the community is viewed as
leisure or free-time activity after the
daily labor has been completed. In the
institutions, the administrator may at-
tempt to make recreation take the place
of labor, but a balance of work and play
must be established in correction. When
this is accomplished, then in a very real
sense recreation becomes a vital part
of the rehabilitative program of cor-
rection.

To fulfill the implied mandate im-
posed upon an institution for offenders,

Donald H. Goff

those inmates who are subsequently re-
leased to society should be released in
such a way that they will be construc-
tive members, adding to the welfare of
the total community. They should be
individuals who are able and willing to
do a day’s work, able and willing to
abide by the rules of society, able and
willing to lead a personally satisfying
life. To do these things a person must
make constructive use of leisure hours,
and for this purpose emphasis in correc-
tional institutions should be upon rec-
reation activities which have a carry-
over value.

It is supercilious to believe that a
large ‘per cent of the inmates released
from correctional institutions will par-
ticipate actively as members of football
squads, baseball teams, or basketball
teams. The carry-over value of major
sports, other than the passive vicarious
experiences a spectator gets by witness-
ing an athletic contest, is nil. The value
of the good public relations created by
a varsity athletic team in an institution
should not be underestimated, however,
for similar to any community which
has a well-known athletic team, the cor-
rectional institution also benefits. How-
ever, an overemphasis upon varsity
sports with a minimum of active par-
ticipation is at the expense of a large
segment of the population which, for
one reason or another, is unable to par-
ticipate actively, but which might find
some status, some recognition, and
obtain a better concept of self if greater
emphasis was placed upon intramural

rather than extramural sports. The in-
tramural program, while possessing lit-
tle carry-over value, is in this case thera-
peutic to the individual.

But to have true carry-over value the
program must be practical and offer op-
portunities to meet as varied interests
as is possible within the custodial as-
pects and financial limitations of the
institution. These activities, for the
older prison group at least, should be of
the less strenuous variety—the interest
shown in weightlifting notwithstanding.
Activities such as boccie ball, table ten-
nis, ceramics, barbershop quartets, mu-
sical combos, oil painting, yes, and even
knitting and crocheting, have been tried
and found successful in institutions for
adult felons.

Recreation in correctional institu-
tions, like other ancillary activities, im-
portant as they may be, must be oper-
ated within the mandate of “and safely
keep.” The admonition does not negate

the possibility of a well-organized pro-
gram, for when recreation assumes its
proper place and balance in the insti-
tutional program it, in and of itself, acts
as ‘a custodial device. A minimizing of
frustrations in fulfilling normal needs—
satisfaction through productive labor,
security through uniformity Without
regimentation, and diversion—tend to
prevent the frustrations inherent in
incarceration from overflowing into dis-
turbances and to reduce to a minimum
the tensions brought about by the in-
tensity of close living.

Recreation, therefore, is a distinct
part of the correctional process. It must
have direction, it must be geared to the
resources of the individual institution
and be an integral part of the program
of that institution. Above all, it must be
flexible and many-sided enough to have
something valid to offer each inmate,
something that is Within the range of
his physical and mental resources.

Watch for this in every issue from
now on! Mrs. Beatrice Hill, consultant
on hospital recreation for the National
Recreation Association has undertaken
to provide our readers with newsy high-
lights of doings in this phase of the rec-
reation field. She writes:

I would like, for instance, to inform
our readers about: a research project,
which is currently in progress at a hos-
pital in New Jersey, co-sponsored by the
National Recreation Association and
the School of Education at New York
University; a movie being made in May
called, R Recreation for the Ill and
Handicapped; plans for this year’s Hos-
pital Section of the National Recreation
Association Congress; and the Hospital
Recreation Institute which was spon-
sored in April by the University of
North Carolina.

During the last year, a council has
been formed which should be of signi-
ficance to every hospital recreation
worker—The Council for the Advance-
ment of Hospital Recreation. It con-
sists of two appointed representatives

from the National Recreation Associa-
tion. The council’s fourth meeting will

be held in Washington in June, and Mr.

Martin Meyers, chairman, will write a
condensed report on what has been ac-
complished at these meetings.

Also, I have some interesting items
about new college and university classes
in hOSpital recreation.

It is my hope that Hospital Capsules
will function With a dual purpose— pro-
viding an exchange for brief news items,
and a stimulant for hospital recreation
people to contribute more articles and

I earnestly urge those readers in this
exciting, new area of recreation, which
embraces hospitals, nursing and con-
valescent homes, and all other facilities
housing the ill and handicapped, to
share any information or news that may
have interest for all of us who are work-

Lakes, rivers and ponds have been pressed into service . . .

It is a well known fact that rural children have fewer 0p-
portunities to learn to swim than have our urban children
in Canada. There are several reasons for this. Indoor swim-
ming pools are practically non-existent in the rural areas.
In the summertime, when swimming is in season, farm par-
ents and children, too, are exceedingly busy; moreover,
some rural people lack appreciation of the value of such an
activity.

In Simcoe County, Ontario, these difiiculties are gradu-
ally being overcome. In 1946, the Simcoe County Recrea-
tion Service organized an experimental swimming class at
a township park. Thirty children were enrolled. This past
summer, eight years later, nearly 1,400 children from twen‘
ty-seven communities received swimming instruction at
eleven centers in the county. Lakes, rivers, and millponds
have been pressed into service and deve10ped by the people
themselves into instruction areas.

First Steps

First, experimental swimming classes were held at Innis-
fil Park on Lake Simcoe every day for two weeks, except on
weekends. The results were gratifying, the children eagcr
and cooperative, the parents enthusiastic. Transportation
had posed the main problem. While a few mothers drove
carloads of children to the classes, other youngsters had
to come with the mailman at 9 A.M. in order to be present
for afternoon swimming.

Our county recreation committee discussed the matter
and, since the county is large—nearly 1,600 square miles—
they decided to offer classes the following summer at four
widely separated points. In order to make it easier for par-
ents to arrange transportation, the classes were planned for
One day a week over a six-week period. Information about
these was circulated through neWSpapers and our voluntary
farm organizations, women’s institutes, and the Federation
of Agriculture—-and the ball began to roll.

That summer an average of ninety children registered at

tion Service in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.

each of the four centers. They came in trucks, private auto-
mobiles, and buses. They bounded out of these on arrival
at the beaches and would have been in the water in a trice
had not instructors and volunteers organized proceedings.
Classes were quickly formed on the basis of age and height,
since almost no one could swim. Fifteen to twenty pupils
were instructed at one time and, for those on shore, water
safety talks, games, and craftwork were organized.

Further Developments

The next year, the recreation director was asked to inspect
two millponds, one in the northern part of the county and the
other in the extreme south, to see if they would be suitable
for swimming instruction. The communities near the Hills-
dale pond formed themselves into a swimming committee
and met with the recreation director throughout the winter
to discuss plans for building an instruction raft and other
facilities. Two communities, who had had experimental
classes the previous year, arranged for a more intensive
swimming program, employing instructors but still depend-
ing upon the recreation service for supervision and advice.
During that summer, nine swimming instruction centers
were in operation.

At the close of the 1949 season, we drew a deep breath
and decided it was time to take stock. We had many prob-
lems. The program was growing too fast for our small budg-
et—provided mainly by the county council and earmarked
especially for advisory, organizational, and leadership train-
ing services—to coPe with. We had stimulated something
which looked as though it might overwhelm all other aspects
of our program! In addition, swimming instruction facili-
ties were inadequate in most centers, and the fact that more
advanced instruction was needed by these children who were
returning year after year emphasized the need for extended
leadership.

Therefore, we called a meeting of interested people from
all over the county, who had assisted with the programs as
volunteers in their home communities, to talk things over.
So far, except for the two communities where a more inten-
sive program had developed, the recreation service had pro-

RECREATION

Q-

vided instruction free of charge. Community representa-
tives saw that this practice could not continue and they
suggested that a specific charge for the service, based on
whether one or two instructors were needed for an area,
should be levied, and that application for thishservice should
be made to the recreation office early in the spring. Respon-
sibilities of community groups and the Simcoe County Rec-
reation Service were outlined as follows:

Each community group shall—

1. Set up a local committee to meet with the recreation
director in the spring.

2. Provide adequate facilities for dressing, instruction,
and so on.

3. Arrange transportation of children to swimming area.

4. Pay a prescribed fee to the Simcoe County Recreation
Service.

5. Provide volunteers to assist with supervision of chil-
dren, games, and so on.

The Simcoe County Recreation Service shall——

1. Assist committees with organizational details.
2. Provide trained instructors.
3. Supervise the over-all program.

After this meeting progress was steadier, the quality of
the program improved and community cooperation became
keener. Fortunately, the swimming and water safety divi-
sion of the Ontario Red Cross Society had been formed in
1947 and their field organizers had taken an interest in our
program from the beginning. They assisted with advice and
encouraged us to send young people to Red Cross instruc-
tors’ courses. Our advanced instruction was geared to their
tests which provided an incentive and a standard for our
county children. This cooperation has continued through-
out the years and is now stronger than ever.

More.and more swimming committees have sprung up.
As increasing numbers of communities wanted to have their
children take advantage of the program, it was necessary to
arrange two, three, or even four afternoons at the same
swimming center for different groups. In some cases area
committees have been formed to which representatives from
several communities come to assist in the planning. This
past year the recreation director worked with thirteen local
or area committees.

The fascinating thing about this development is the way
in which the pe0ple have taken hold themselves, and the
ideas which have developed throughout the years. In addi-
tion to our spring meetings, we get together in the fall to
evaluate our efforts—to assess the good points and to find
out what needs to be remedied or improved.

Because local conditions differ, a variety of ways of hand-
ling finances, transportation, and other matters have devel-
oped. Groups set their own fees per child or family. These
are always very small; in fact, some groups make no charge
at all, defraying the expenses with voluntary donations from
individuals or organizations in their district. School buses
are used in many cases now, or a community car pool is es-
tablished so that the cost of gas and the time used in driving
is shared.

MAY 1955

At each swimming center, too, different problems are in
evidence. Sometimes, as in the case at Thompsonville where
we use a beautiful site on the Nottawasaga River, the river-
bed is completely changed from year to year. This may

'mean hours of work for the men in the community—bull-

dozing, putting in more sand, reconstructing rafts or booms
for the instruction area. Attempts to provide temporary
instruction wharves and rafts which will withstand vagaries
of winds and weather on some of the larger bodies of water
are often foiled.

Pioneer efforts to meet various needs are often humorous.
At Hillsdale the boys’ dressing room was at first ust a pile
of cordwood, stacked in such a way that there was a small
space for a door and a wall all around, high enough to en-
sure privacy. Fortunately it didn’t rain much that summer.
Now a well-constructed building has been moved to that
site. At Willow Creek, one of our newest areas, tarpaulins
wound around stakes, which have been planted in two wood-
sy spots, make the dressing rooms. These have to be put up
and taken down each day. This year the local committee is
considering the purchase of a discarded streetcar to meet
dressing room needs.

At the swimming area, our instructors take over but com-
munity volunteers are essential too. Someone must look
after the records for we now have cards which show the chil-
drens’ attendance and progress over successive years. Others
are needed to supervise the dressing rooms and still others
to look after games on shore, the free swim area, and' the
“buddy boards.” Our recreation service has developed the
practice of supplying an over-all shore organizer to see that
the children are ready for classes and to supervise activities
on shore, in addition to one or two instructors.

Water-safety knowledge forms an important part of the
program. Visual aids such as posters and sometimes mov-
ing pictures are used to teach children how to look after
themselves in the water and how to help a drowning person
with a simple reaching assist. If numbers warrant, classes
are carried on simultaneously in shallow and deep areas
for beginners and advanced pupils respectively. Children
are now carefully graded and placed in classes suited to
their ability in the water. At the close of the season, Red
Cross tests for those at more advanced levels are held in a
number of places in the county.

Each year more staff members are needed as new swim-
ming areas are formed or advanced classes develop. This
past year three or four teams of leaders daily left the ofiice,
which is located in the center of the county, to drive to their
respective swimming centers. These were located anywhere
from five to forty miles away. With them went a basket con-
taining various necessary equipment such as a first-aid kit,
posters, lifebuoys, and other teaching aids. Their stamina
and enthusiasm in the face of varying weather conditions is
to be commended.

Appreciation of our Simcoe County people for this acti-
vity could not help but grow as they became involved in it
themselves and saw what it could mean to the health and
safety of their children and to their enjoyment of a skill
which would last a lifetime. ~ ~

stage one at Christmas time—or just any time—as an annual event.

“WHY-DADDIES” are not peculiar to any one place but
are to be found over the entire face of the earth.
Most of you have daily contact with these either at your
home or in conjunction with your park and recreation pro-
gram and activities.

You ask what is a“Why-Daddy”? It’s a tow-headed young-
ster, with an infectious grin that shows several missing
teeth, a smudge of dirt that never seems to disappear, and
pockets crammed full of every possible sort of object
stumbled across during a day’s normal meandering. It is a
child with an innate curiosity that, like an automatic ma-
chine gun, fires a never-ending round of “why’s”—“Why
do they do this?” and “Why don’t they do that?” “Why?”
“Why?” “Why?”—throughout every second, minute, and
hour of the day.

We believe that it is every child’s God-given right and
heritage to be given the opportunity to ask all these “why’s”
about the fascinating and great out-of-doors world that we
live in. We also believe that a metropolitan park system sur-
rounding a large urban area, such as we have at Cincinnati,
has an unlimited opportunity and even a moral obligation
to provide a chance for the children of these urban areas
to pursue this natural curiosity of theirs concerning the
wonders of nature. What a bright and enchanting new
world is opened up to those “Why-Daddies” who get to
hear and actually see the answers to such questions as
“What makes a tree grow?” or “What happens to flies and
mosquitoes in the winter?” or “How does a bird fly?” The
answer to all of the thousands of questions such as these is
the day-camp program.

Some men without a broad, progressive outlook might
say at this point that the parks are there—let those children

who want to make use of the areas do so. The fallacy of this

It is every child’s God-given right to have opportunity
to ask all of these “whys?” Here, park naturalist in
Tacoma, Washington, displays a rattlesnake’s fangs.

viewpoint is that we have found that the children roaming
aimlessly through the parks with nothing to do are usually
those who are going to turn to various forms of vandalism
for pastime, while those who are busy in a program that
interests them and answers their questions need not be of
concern in this respect.

As is the case with most programs, there are two extremes
practiced, with a desired program being one somewhere
midway between the two. At one end we can find the for-
malized program in which the children are strictly regi-
mented in a highly organized group that must follow a set
pattern day by day. This is the group that is scheduled for
bird identification today and, by golly, bird identification
it’s going to be despite the many questions being asked
about the nest of snakes found adjacent to the camp. Most
of you—fathers, especially—know that as soon as a child is
steered away from something he is interested in at the
moment, he is going to resist all efforts to interest him in
something else.

At the other extreme we have the so-called day camps that
transport a group of children to the area, unload them from
the buses, and then forget about them until the leader fran-
tically blows his whistle in an attempt to get everyone to-
gether for the return trip.

Of course, the middle-of-the-road path that outlines the
program and attempts to guide the children’s thinking along
certain desired patterns is the one which is most successful.
Allowances are made for individual interests and for more
concentration in those fields that seem to provide a higher
degree of interest as evidenced by the many questions of

the “Why-Daddies.”

RECREATION

Basically, our park district provides facilities and nat-
uralists for all nature work, while the camp groups super-
vise all correlated activities and provide the necessary lead-
ers. The park board must approve all programs as proposed
by the various’ groups. We pretty much go along with the
theory that these day-camp programs should be a definite
outdoor experience utilizing all those things found out-of-
doors and not some city playground or church-basement
activity moved to a woodland setting.

Let us take the craft program as an example. The day-
camp program wherein the boys bring to camp a few pieces
of wood, pre-cut in some manual training department, and
then sit around a table and assemble them into birdhouses
is not providing the same experience as the one where the
boys go out into the woods to collect their own raw materi-
als, such as the bark on a fallen tree, and then use their
ingenuity to assemble these materials into birdhouses.

Likewise, the boy interested in Indian lore who purchases
a loom and several bottles of brightly colored beads at the
ten-cent store to take to camp and sits under a tree weaving
a belt is not enjoying the same experience as the boy who
collects clay out of the creek bottom and molds it into vari-
ous pieces of Indian pottery, or the one who gathers flints
and other stones to make his own collection of Indian
weapons and tools.

In the above examples, we have on the one hand, those
groups using park areas only as a convenient locale for car-
rying on activities not necessarily utilizing the natural sur-
roundings; on the other hand, another group utilizes the
native materials and opportunities not to be found within
urban areas other than in our parks. I don’t believe there
is any question which of these two is more desirable.

The entire day camp program as carried on in our parks
includes the following major activities: (1) nature activities
and crafts; (2) campcraft and woodcraft; (3) boating;
(4) fishing; (5) Indian lore; and (6) games. Let us ex-
amine each of these separately. All nature activities are
under the supervision of, and led by, our park naturalist
and his assistants. They conduct walks, give lectures, and
see to it that the craft program is correlated with their
nature-study activities. This is not a formalized, school-
room type of study. The “Why-Daddies”—are encouraged
to ask their many “why’s,” and whenever possible they
are given the opportunity to see the answer as well as hear
the questions answered by the naturalist. The naturalist
can talk at great length about how a snake is not cold and
slimy, but there will still probably be some non-believers
until they are allowed to handle one and feel the dry skin
themselves.

If, while on their way to collect some fossils in a gorge,
the “Why-Daddies” want to tarry around the pond and ask
their many “why’s” about the myriad forms of life found
there, the naturalist does not lose all of his patience and
breath by blowing on a whistle to get them moving on to
the gorge. Since they have shown an interest in the water
beetles, tadpoles, and dragonflies, he answers their questions
then and there. Tomorrow, he can take them to the gorge,
by-passing the pond. The “Why-Daddies” are interested in
their “why’s” and not in something that the schedule crams

down their throats.

We have found that teachers in the biological field pro-
vide the best source of part-time naturalists to work under
the supervision of our park naturalist. They are usually
happy to get away from the formalized school-room tech-
niques and take part in the more informal day-camp pro-
gram.

The campcraft program is a joint effort on the part of the
naturalists and camp leaders. When a boy burns the Mulli-
gan stew which is all he has for lunch, he learns something
he is not going to forget for some time. When the lunch is
over and several of the “Why-Daddies” are still hufling and
puffing on their smoking, green firewood in an attempt to
get a fire going to cook their beans, you can be sure that
they are going to be a great source of “why’s” concerning
prOper fire-building techniques for some time to come. The
use of axes and other tools, fire safety, improvising camp
equipment, and other such correlated campcraft subjects
offer a real source of questions.

Boating 'is one of the facilities mentioned earlier that
involves the use of park equipment where there is normally
a service charge. However, as long as the day-camp group
is one working in cooperation with the park district, we
allow the use of whatever boats are necessary to carry on a
water-safety program on the lake. The impulsive boy who
has to run ahead of the group to be the first one in the boat
usually provides some merriment and a lesson as he learns
too late that there are proper and safe boating techniques.
He becomes a believer in a hurry as he does “splits” that
would do justice to an acrobatic dancer, with one foot on
shore and the other in the bow of the departing boat. Each

doors expcrience, nature and campcraft activities and
not a mere repetition of the city—playground programs.

 

boat is required to have an instructor who shows the vari-
ous phases of water safety and boat operation.

The “Why-Daddies” usually have a field day with their
questions in the fishing area. One wants to know what hap-
pened when he caught his fish only to jerk it in so hard that
line and fish ended up hanging from the higher branches
of a tree. Another wants to know what happened after
getting stuck with one of the catfish’s barbels. They learn
many things about fish as they ask their questions.

The study of Indian lore is another phase usually of in-
terest to boys. We find this can be incorporated into a
council-ring ceremony following the noonday meal, which
incidentally allows the boys to relax after eating. Indian
lore, like most any other activity, can be overemphasized
to the detriment of a well-balanced program. I know of one
so-called day camp where the children are greeted each day
by a group of leaders completely decked out in Indian garb,
and that is all they get all day long—Indian history, Indian
dances, Indian songs, Indian ceremonies, and Indian crafts.
Why, they can get that by sitting at home and watching a
certain television program. Such a day’s outing cannot
possibly be classified as a day-camp program.

The game program is another where overemphasis is quite
possible and, in fact, common. When I speak of games, I do
not refer to the common playground games such as baseball,
volleyball, and so on. As a former athletic coach, I am
most certainly in favor of these types of games; not, how-
ever, as part of a day camp program. The game activities
in a day camp program can be set up to provide plenty of
fun along with some learning experiences and a furthering
appreciation of all nature’s wonders. There are also some
individual skills in the game classification such as archery
that are suitable for an outdoor program. There are several
good books and bulletins on the subject of nature games
that can be used for reference.*

There are, naturally, many problems that have arisen for

which we do not have the answer. One of these concerns the
older boys in any mixed-age group. We have found they

Bibliography; and Nature Games for Various Situations, NRA pub-

normally do not fit into all phases of the day-camp program
that must be planned for a group with an average age lower
than theirs. The answer seems to be a separate program for
these older boys to keep them physically and mentally busy.
For instance, we have in mind, letting them construct a
boat dock for the use of the day campers for boating and
fishing activities. We believe that cutting the timber, driv-
ing the pilings, and providing a finished product that will
prove useful, will be of great interest to them. We have also
been thinking in terms of getting some of the older boys
interested in nature photography. Here, again, they can
use native materials to construct photography blinds; where-
by, they can get the picture of the mother fox and her cubs
playing near their den, or the sparrow hawk going about his
deadly business of securing mice for food. Their finished
pictures provide the needed incentive for them to follow
through.

Another major problem is that so many of the leaders
sent out with these children’s groups are in no way trained
to be of much help in the program. We find so many of
these so-called leaders impatient with the many “why’s” of
the “Why-Daddies” instead of letting these “why’s” provide
the impetus for their various projects. We can operate a
training school for these leaders in the spring, but the
trouble is that so many groups do not hire their part-time
help until a week or two before the program actually starts.
We have also tried a concentrated one-day training course
just before the start of the day-camp program, which is
helpful but definitely not a solution to the problem of pro-
perly trained leadership. '

HAPPINESS

The Detroit Plan for the Retarded Child

In the last few years, recreation departments in a number of communi-
ties'have instigated special programs for that neglected group—retarded
children. The following article is so heart warming in its philosophy,

and so sound in its planning for this group, that we reprint it in full, hop-
ing that it will help other departments include retarded children in their
services. It originally appeared as a mimeographed leaflet.

 

STRICTLY speaking the “Detroit Plan”
isn’t any plan in the accepted sense.
It follows no critical or academic pat-
tern with fine technical terms.

The Detroit Plan is nothing more
than giving the retarded child an op-
portunity to be happy, to feel that he be-
longs, that his rights are the rights of
the normal youngster.

There is no room for pity or segre-
gation or hidden shame. The Detroit
Plan is a program built on love and
understanding, on thoughtfulness and
encouragement. It decries emphasis on
abnormality and has little tolerance for
the patronizing attitude.

Retarded children, we feel, should be
treated as normal children. They have
the eyes, the hands, and the hearts of
normal youngsters, and —they have
souls. Theirs should be a natural part
in any day’s program. They should not
be denied the color, life, and healthful
circumstances that surround the aver-
age child.

Pursuing this line of thought, the
Detroit Department of Parks and Rec-
reation was only too happy to place its
facilities at the disposal of the Detroit
Association for Retarded Children and
all the parents of such children in the
metropolitan area. Progress began in a
large way three years ago when a dis-

tressed mother appealed to the depart-
ment. “Couldn’t something be done,”
she asked, “about a place where my
child might play like any other child
but not as hard at it? Couldn’t she join
other such children in pleasant games?”

The appeal was not long in taking
practical form. It was an opportunity
to enlarge our objective in taking care
of all children regardless of involuntary
predicament.

First a suitable center had to be es-
tablished. A fine, old residence, set
amid beautiful surroundings in Rouge
Park along the winding Rouge River,
was selected. Alterations were made, the
kitchen enlarged and modernized, and
furniture built to fit the youngsters.

A play leader, without professional
psychological background, was select-
ed; the mothers were organized; and
a program schedule was worked out.
Soon these once-neglected youngsters
were romping in spacious rooms with
well-lighted surroundings, and when
lunch time came they lunched in groups
in party style. '

They walked in the fields and enjoyed
the myriads of trees and leaves, birds
and flowers. They became attached to
a goat, a duck, a pig, or a lamb that the
department provided. They swam.

This assembly of children became a
new investment in happiness. They
learned to have something—something
interesting—to do and their mothers
were relieved with a free day at home.

They hiked in the woods and stayed
together just like any hiking club, and
they had our nature study man to lead
the way. They picked up a toad or a
leaf or a flower along the way and when
they were back they were tired, but
they would sleep in happiness.

Earle Rissmann was the leader se—
lected for this eXperiment in living and
he is now the direbtor of the fully de—
veloped year—round activity program.
Assisting him are Lorraine Davis and
Arthur F. Clayton. The original center
has grown to three thoughtfully equip-
ped establishments in widely separated
parts of the city. A day at one of these
centers runs something as follows:

The morning starts with a ceremon-
ial Hag-raising. New children are intro-
duced and any birthday or very special
event is happily celebrated.

Group singing is then enjoyed and
this is participated in by the parents
who have brought the children by vol-
unteer car pool. Some of them remain
in the park to help the leaders, to lend
an additional hand and to provide trans-
portation back home.

The day program runs from ten in the
morning till three in the afternoon. A
hike usually follows the flag-pole rites.
Needless to say, appetites are stimulated
for the lunch that follows. Then there
is the good sleep and rest. In the after—
noons there are suitable games, per-
haps a storytelling session, and, of
course, lots of toys for learning hands.

Games may he a variation of Hot
Potato, or there may be marching or
rhythm drills for the younger groups.
The older children are encouraged in
volleyball, badminton, softball, and
pingpong. This group activity gener-
ates social contacts and neighborliness
denied the youngsters in the days when
the frightful veil of secrecy screened

them from society.

Crafts are not forgotten. Some make
leather purses, others work on simple
plastic weaving. Others frame pictures
with wool yarn and color pictures of
their own gay imaginations.

When the day is ended there is a
closing ceremony and the pledge to the
flag. There are leave-takings and the
prospect of a pleasant tomorrow.

This is what happens in the summer-
time. Winters are not too different, but
the programs are more fixed and call
for close planning between leaders and
parents.

The parents are called upon to help
plan and assist in the activities. Lead-
ership is delegated to a committee of
five mothers, and each member is as-
signed a day during which she is in
charge of the other mother assistants.
There are usually five such mothers
each day at a center.

These mothers look after the ward—
robe needs, lunches, and rest periods.
They also help the juniors in group
play. This is usually accomplished by
means of drills, color matching, count-
ing, singing, and other play.

The senior group is immensely proud
of its craft activities, which are just as
varied as any typical craft program
normal children enjoy in a recreation
center. They have worked in wood—
craft, ceramics, oil painting, papercraft,
and have made items for Christmas and
other holiday decorations.

Once a week the older children swim
in a community pool. They receive les-
sons, are enthusiastic, and disport them-
selves as any other youngsters.

So that is the Detroit Plan—a story
for a five-year-old that a five-year-old
enjoys and a game or a craft for an
older lad, a frolic down a lane, some
work in a garden beside a parent who
conveys progress to the child as he helps
prepare the earth and the Howers that
grow from it.

The plan still leaves responsibility
with the parent through his participa‘
tion in the program. But there is mut-
ual recreation made doubly important
because it is compounded of love and
cooperation and understanding.

Our hope is that its seed be planted
through this vast country of ours whose
founding creed beckons us all to, be
equals in our pursuit of happiness.

Mushball

THIS IS A COMPETITIVE game which was
successfully revived in Vancouver,
Washington, in 1947, by Carl Gustaf-
son, athletic director, for the purpose of
giving older men a chance to participate
in active sports.

Similar to softball, it is played with
a ball fourteen inches in circumference
—-which cannot be hit too hard or far.

The pitching distance is thirty-live
feet. The pitcher delivers the ball at a
moderate speed but is required to give
it a slight arc—0f approximately a thir-
ty-degree angle and not to exceed eight
feet in height. If the ball is thrown too
fast, it is an illegal pitch. This is de-
termined by the umpire. There is no
walk in Mushball, and every pitch must
be completed. A complete count equals
live balls and three strikes.

Base running is the same as in soft-
ball. Base runners cannot lead off until
the ball leaves the pitcher’s hands; and
unless the batter has legally hit the ball,
they cannot continue but must get back
to the original base. A play is not over
until the ball is under control by the
infield. If a runner has started before
the ball gets under control, he may con-
tinue at his own risk, but is subject to
being tagged. No bunting or sliding is
allowed. After a Hyball is caught, a
player on base may tag base and ad-
vance; but he cannot run on overthrows
and passed balls from the infield. If a
foul tip goes over the batter’s head, and
is caught, the batter is out; and it is an
automatic out if any runner is off base.
A runner may advance only one base on
outfield overthrows.

There are at least eight, but not more
than ten, players on a team. The age of
the players ranges from thirty-live up;
however, two players may be under
thirty-live, but not less than twenty-live.
Seven innings constitute a game.

 

The batting “T.” The base takes the place of home plate. A series of
ten holes are bored along its sides and in the middle, into which {lex-
ible rubber-hose uprights in a number of different lengths are adjusted.

Our league last year consisted of
twelve teams, playing one night a week
and, approximately, twenty-two games
a season. '

We played for fun only; therefore,
the feeling on the diamond was one of
fair play and go od sportsmanship.
There were very few arguments and we
always had a competent umpire to settle
any issues which might arise.

We hope that other athletic directors
will like our game and sponsor it into
a nationwide sport.—CREIGHTON SAND-
ERS, Vancouver, Washington.

Using the Batting “T”
With Small Fry

N THE first year of our baseball school
I in Wyandotte, Michigan, approxi-
mately ninety boys participated. The
problem was to speed up the game and

to have all the boys get a chance to play.
Thus the idea of a batting instructor
came into being. This piece of equip-
ment is called the Tru-Swing Batting
Instructor or the Batting “T.” Using
the Batting “T” increased the partici-
pation to over two hundred boys the
second year and to over three hundred
boys the third year.

How [£15 Played

The catcher controls the game once
the batter steps into the box. He may
place the ball in the center of the hose
or on the inside corner of home plate
or on the outside corner of home plate.
The batter must not change positions in
the batter’s box. The pitcher is in the
pitcher’s box and goes through the mo-
tion of pitching. The catcher will fol-
low up the pitch by telling the batter
when to swing. Photograph shows the

One of Vancouver’s mushball teams. Note that the batboy, in foreground,
holds regular-size ball beside the larger one used here. This game was
introduced in that city in 1947 to give older men a chance in active sports.

boy hitting at the ball. If a batter misses
the ball and hits the rubber hose, it is a
foul ball. Three such foul balls and the

batter is out. Picture also shows the
proper stance at home plate, and how to

meet the ball on the swing.
The Game Itself

Simple rules were improvised:

1. Any number of players can play.
We have twenty boys on a team playing
the game.

2. There is no bunting. A batted ball
hitting the rubber is a foul ball; but if
the ball is caught in the air, the batter is
out.

3. There are no strike outs.

4. The batter is out if he throws the
bat after swinging and hitting the ball.»

5. Base runners are not allowed to

lead off base.

6. Players can score from third base

only on a hit ball.

7. The game is played on a regula-
tion softball diamond.

8. All other baseball rules in the offi-

cial rule book predominate and control
the game.

How Important Is This
Development to the Youngsters
1. The game is speeded up. Where
it took three hours for four innings it
now takes one and one-half hours forl
nine innings. l
2. The fear of being hit by a pitched
ball is gone.

 

3. The boys are taught the proper
way to run bases.

4. The boys learn to bring the ball in
by relays from the outfield.

5. It gives the boys confidence be-
cause they play and take part in the
game all the time.

6. The two important things in base-
ball are to keep your eye on the ball and
the proper swing in batting. These
things are developed in this game too.

7. The boys get the athletic bug and
keep it. They continue to play and go
on into the higher age groups. '

Leadership and How to Get
Along with Other Boys

1. The boys are taught responsibility.

2. They learn how to play with other
boys.

3. They learn sportsmanship.

4. Above all, character building of
the right type is brought out at this early
age, and the youngsters will {ind it very

RESEARCH

 

Recreation Opportunities in Kansas

The December 1954 Newsletter of the Kansas Recreation
Association records the findings in a study of the recreation
opportunities provided by Kansas communities during the
summer of 1954. Reports were submitted by seventy-eight
communities, all but eight of which reported one or more
recreation activities.

Thirty-seven cities reported 191 supervised playgrounds
with a total enrollment of 43,141 children: 17 cities oper-
ated them mornings and afternoons; 16 cities operated them
only half-days; 4 cities operated some full-days and others
half-days. Twenty-two cities Operated their playgrounds
for an eight-week season, 15 others for a nine- to twelve-
week season. Only one city reported a playground season of
less than eight weeks.

Baseball and softball were reported separately: 62 cities
reported 798 baseball teams with 13,914 players involved in
6,868 games; 35 cities reported a total of 624 softball teams
for boys and men with 7,006 players. Of these cities, 18
also reported 124 girls’ softball teams with 1,610 partici-
pants. The figures gathered indicated that baseball was pre-
dominantly a boys’ activity in Kansas while softball was
predominantly a game for men.

Among the other activities, the most popular from the
point of view of the number of cities reporting was horse-

flying, and track meets. The largest number of participants
—14,788—was reported in the fishing derbies, followed by
track meets, kite flying, dramatics, and horseshoes.

Data were also gathered with reference to activities in
which instruction was offered. Band led in the number of
cities reporting instruction, followed by swimming, tennis,
crafts, archery, golf, and baton twirling. The largest num-
ber of participants, however, was reported for swimming—
18,736~followed by crafts, dancing, archery, band, golf,
and tennis in the order named.

The same Newsletter reports the results of a salary study
in Kansas cities, 16 of which reported. The salaries paid
the superintendents of recreation varied from $4,500 to
$7,500 with an average of $5,360. Thirteen Kansas cities
reported full-time superintendents. The average car allow-
ance was $44 per month; the average sick leave, two weeks;
the average vacation period, two weeks.

Playground Apparatus Use in California Schools

“The Uses of Playground Apparatus in Selected Cali-
fornia Elementary Schools” is the title of a doctorate thesis

 

MR. BUTLER is director of the NRA Research Department.

MAY 1955

George D. Butler

submitted by Percival M. Bliss, general supervisor of the
San Jose city schools, to the University of California at Ber-
keley. The purpose of the study was to determine how de-
sirable and effective is the playground apparatus commonly
used at elementary schools. The results of his study were
obtained from questionnaire replies received from 214
schools in the San Francisco Bay area counties and from
visits to 50 of these schools, all of which have playground
apparatus and a minimum of seven teachers.

The major findings and conclusions were:
0 Although considered desirable, play apparatus falls short
of its potential contribution to the school program.
0 The educational effectiveness of apparatus in use is largely
dependent on the amount of planned, skillful teaching given
children in its proper use.
0 Play equipment as currently used only partially meets
general objectives and purposes of modern elementary edu-
cation; it best meets those which relate to the child’s grow-
ing responsibility in social relationships, and his desirable
physical development.
0 The appeal of apparatus to younger children is strong
particularly items which give a thrill from active use.
0 Non-standard items of play equipment, though not well
known to school administrators, apparently stimulate crea-
tive, dramatic, and imaginative active play.
0 The principal has primary responsibility and exercises
the greatest influence in planning for new apparatus.
0 No one type of material used for surfacing under appara-
tus is best, and no material prevents accidents.
0 Teacher effectiveness is handicapped by inadequate edu-
cation in the use of physiological and sociological effects of
play as motivating forces in the school program.

Playground Accident Prevention

Safety Education for January 1955 contained an article
reporting on the detailed accident records that have been
compiled by the Los Angeles City School District. It also
recorded the experiments made on school playgrounds with
reference to care and use of apparatus and surfaces under
them.

The four conclusions reached by the staff as a result of its

observation and experiences are:

1. Supervision and education are the most important factors in
accident reduction.

2. Sand under apparatus is not the answer to the. prevention of
head injuries. I

3. Some substance which will cushion the fall without rebound
and within the limits of deceleration which the human head can stand
should be installed under all apparatus used by elementary school
children.

4. Blacktop is the most suitable substances yet developed for the
general play area. .* '

TYPICAL CITY PARKLET

PARKLE’I‘S

PARK LET is a neighborhood play area,

built under space limitations, de-
signed to be as attractive as possible to
the user and a credit to the neighbor-
hood. A parklet is an attempt to com-
bine the aesthetics of a park with the
utility of a playground.“ Since there is
nothing new under the sun, we do not
claim that the idea of the parklet is
original with the city of Pittsburgh, but
we have not knowingly copied the idea
from any other municipality in the
country.

In planning the layout of the parklets,
we tried to cover family recreation ac-
tivities by having available facilities

that would take care of the adults as
well as the small children. We felt that

parents would en 0y sitting in the shade
of a tree while their children played on
various types of equipment.

A children’s play area in a park, with
the play apparatus placed on grass-cov-
ered areas among trees and shrubs, can
be, and often is, a thing of beauty, at-
tractive and inviting. It has its place in
the over-all park and recreation pro-
gram, but it does not answer the prob-
lem of taking care of the youngsters in
a heavily populated area, where there
are no parks.

In Pittsburgh for many years the
problem was answered by taking any
vacant area, often less than an acre,
leveling it off for play purposes, sur-
rounding it with a fence, and calling it
a playground. It was usually dusty or
muddy. and the smaller children fared

and Allen E. Risendorph

rather badly in the competition that in-
variably ensued between the boys who
wanted to play scrub baseball and the
little ones who wanted to use the play
apparatus commonly placed in one cor-
ner of the area.

It wasn’t safe for the smaller chil-
dren, and it wasn’t long before they
were chased off the playground by the
older boys. Later these same boys were
often forced off by older teen-agers who
also wanted to play ball and who were
able to hit the balls over the fences,
meaning broken windows, damaged
roofs, and further neighborhood dis-
turbances.

In 1947 the parks bureau and the rec-
reation bureau were united into a parks
and recreation department for the city
of Pittsburgh. This was an opportunity
for the cooperative meeting of minds in
a way that had not been possible be-

fore, and the solution of many mutual
problems was undertaken. One of the
problems studied was that of children’s
play areas, and we found that it was
possible to combine both park and play-
ground principles in designing a play
area.

The first parklet was built as an ex-
periment on an existing small play
ground in a residential area with an
ordinary quota of children. Its success
was instantaneous and it attracted city
wide attention. It looked good, it worked
as planned, and the idea behind it at-
tracted the active financial support of a
civic-minded industrialist.

The second and third parklets were
built on former school sites in the really
heavily congested Hill District of Pitts-
burgh where the parklet idea was to get
its severest test. The fourth and small-
est parklet to date was constructed on
three vacant lots in a tightly built resi-
dential area.

The city now has fourteen parklets.of
various sizes and of various degrees of
complexity. These range from the small-
est, which has an area of only 7,500
square feet, to the largest with 24,000
square feet. Even the largest is small by
all recreation standards, but it must be
remembered that they are being built
under real space handicaps. They are
not cheap in terms of dollars, as the
costs have ranged from $6,300 to $23,-
500. As long as they work, however,

This parklet demonstrates
what can be accomplished
with a small space within
a congested locality.
The fourteen parklets,

up to 24,000 square feet.

and provide the answer to the congested
neighborhood recreation problem, we
believe the money will have been well
spent.

The money has come from several
sources. The city itself has furnished
the land, with the cooperation of Alle-
gheny County and the Pittsburgh Board
of Public Education, and has developed
four of these parklets. In four cases
the city has bought or furnished the
land while private individuals have gen-
erously paid the costs of construction.
In one neighborhood, adjacent to an
industrial area, the various industries
and businessmen banded together and
bought the necessary ground and then
turned it over to the city which paid for
the construction. ,

Each parklet has posed an individual
problem in design which has been com-
plicated in almost all cases by difiicult
topography. Pittsburgh, as you most
likely know, is a city of hills and val-
leys with little flat land. Also, it natur-
ally follows, the best land is built on
first—so the areas left where we can
find vacant space are frequently very
difiicult to develop. One parklet area,
170 by 180 feet, has a grade difference
of thirty-six feet from the high to the
low corner.

The grading requirements usually de-
termine the maximum amount of flat,
usable play space that we can obtain
from a given area. We then decide

whether the playground should be de-
veloped on one or two levels. One level
is considered the best solution, when
possible, and all the facilities are then
placed in what we think is the right re-
lationship. When two levels are neces-
sary, one is designed for the smaller
children and the other for teen-age and
perhaps adult use. This complicates the
supervision problem, but in some ways
it helps because it separates the older
and younger children.

This planning of levels is often a fas-
cinating study as it is frequently amaz-
ing to see how areas can be floated up or
down, within limits, to achieve a desired
result such as level access from the
street sidewalk to a play area at the
proper point. In all cases, we have man-
aged to have at least one entrance to the
small children’s playground so graded
that mothers with baby buggies and
small children will be able to enter with-
out climbing dangerous steps.

The supervisory problem has been
solved by having the maintenance per-
sonnel on duty from early morning
until the middle of the afternoon and
the recreation leader on duty from the
middle of the afternoon until dark. Be-
cause of their locations these areas are
open seven days a week from June
through Labor Day. In May and the
balance of September the recreation
leader does not go on duty until after
school is closed in the afternoon, but

 

237

the regular summer schedule is main-
tained on Saturdays and Sundays. This
enables the leader to properly adjust the
needs of the various age groups, up to
and including the adults, in a well or-
ganized and planned program.

We fpel that this cooperative work
between the grounds and buildings bur-
eau and the recreational activities bur-
eau has done a great deal to mutually
cement proper understanding between
activities and maintenance personnel.
All play areas are solidly paved for ease
of maintenance and a longer season of
use.
play apparatus is placed with the idea
that one person can keep it under con-
trol during heavy playtime.

In selecting the type of play equip-
ment for these grounds, two considera-
tions are vital to our thinking. One is
maintenance and safety, and the other
is usability. We have made it a point
in the past few years to have no swings,
slides, or other apparatus higher than
eight feet. The slides are of stainless
steel and are six and eight feet in height.

In the small children’s area, the

The swings are regular and baby types
with a maximum height of eight feet.
The sandbox is of concrete, constructed
with proper drainage. A “catwalk,”
either in one or two units, is never over
seven feet and is provided for climbing
exercise and shoulder development.
The spray shower, with a rough con-
crete base to prevent slipping and con-
sequent falling, is often placed in one
corner and is usually located at the low-
est corner so that if the drainage is
stopped up, the resulting overflow will
go directly into a gutter or drain and
not flow over the play area. The reason
for the spray shower rather than a wad-
ing pool is twofold: first, it eliminates

the necessity for additional chlorina-
tion and filtration; and, second, it re-
duces the amount of supervision neces-
sary. The small children seem to have
as much fun running in and out of a
shower in safety as children in general
do playing in a very shallow wading
pooL

The sandbox is preferably placed
away from the spray pool for many rea-
sons. Swings are best placed along one
side with the idea of eliminating the
passing of children behind or in front
of them as much as possible for safety
reasons. Slides, Climbers, craft tables,
and so on, are located so as to interfere
as little as possible with the necessary
traffic, with enough benches placed for
the convenience of mothers or watchers.

Proper planting for aesthetic and for
practical reasons is a very necessary
part of every parklet. Naturally, all
surrounding slopes are covered with
shrubs and ground covers and inter-
planted with properly placed trees. Even
where there are no slopes, however, we
consider .it essential to provide a band
of planting around each play area to
insure the green effect which is the
trademark of the parklet.

Planting is also used to form indi-
vidual spaces for various forms of play
and, frequently, to separate one piece
of play apparatus from another. These
interior plant beds break up the play-
ground so that it cannot be used for ball
play, eliminate the barren feeling that
you get from an unbroken paved play
area, and also provide the opportunity
to place shade trees at desired points
for the physical protection of play-
ground users.

Our experience with planting around
playgrounds was very sad until we de-

cided to fence every planting area re-
gardless of location. We use fences ex-
tensively for both the safety of the
visitors and for plant protection. These
fences which surround the planting area
are also used for traffic control to pre-
vent accidents by children running in
front of or into swings and slides, as
well as for general beautification and
protection of the entire area. These
fences are usually low, three-foot chain-
link fences with the wire fabric invert-
ed for safety reasons; that is, with the
rounded edge up and the pointed edge
down. Naturally, the plantings are kept
very simple, and only what we consider
rugged material is used.

Up to now I have described the basic
and minimum parktet. Where space is
available and desirable, we provide
play for older children such as a basket-
ball court, a volleyball court, a paddle
tennis area, table tennis or ping-pong
tables, and horseshoe courts. Some of
these games require higher fencing, up
to fifteen feet, but at all times we en-
deavor to maintain the parklet atmos-
phere with surrounding and separating
planting. As you can see from the list
of facilities available, an attempt is
made to cover in a modified way the
recreation needs of the family.

The parklet plan has been adopted by
another local organization. The Hous-
ing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh
has included a parklet type of children’s
playground in the last two of their de-
velopments, in addition to landscaped
tot lots. It might be noted here that the
department of parks and recreation was
asked to cooperate very closely in the
planning and design of these parklet
areas so that they are of the same type
as ours and embody the same features.

We believe that our efforts to produce
workable neighborhood play areas have
met with a considerable degree of suc-
cess. We tried things on our first park-
let that we would not think of trying
now, and we are constantly learning
what we can or cannot do. In observing
the usage of these parklets, our feeling
is that the beautifying of the area
through the use of plant materials re-
duccs the destruction often present in
harrcn play areas. The parklet, in our
estimation, means more safety and in-
creased recrcation for all of the citizens
in a given community.

OR GANIZA T I ON O
of SERVICE to
SENIOR CITIZENS

Karl F. Edler

The Omaha Senior Citizens’ Program is a new advisory service available to

homes for the aged, churches, public and. private welfare agencies, group work
and recreation program agencies, service clubs, and organizations who wish to
sponsor activities for older people. Sponsored by the Community Services and
the Park Recreation Commission, this provides information and consultation
on activity organization, promotion, supervision, finance, facilities and
participation. In addition, the Omaha Senior Citizens’ Program sponsors a
limited number of activities that are city-wide in nature for the older people.

During 1948 many recreation and some welfare authori-
ties throughout the United States operated programs of
activities for older adults. The idea was not entirely new,
but most cities were just recognizing, for the first time, the
necessity for a well-organized approach to leisure problems
of oldsters.

Things were different in Omaha. A small group sponsored
by the alumni association of a local university was initiated
that same year. Called the Best Years Club, it devoted
regular meetings to discussions based on problems of ap-
proaching old age. These were led by local authorities in
gerontology and attended by a number of professional and
business people. The local Council of Jewish Women or-
ganized and sponsored a Golden-Age Club and met with
moderate success. The idea was just beginning. . . .

By 1950 the idea had been discussed among executives of
several agency members of the group work division of
United Community Services. At a division meeting, the
film Life with Grandpa was shown, with an inspiring talk.
The division decided to take on as a project the stimulation
of programs of activities for older adults. A commitlee was
formed, and its first recommendation was that a definite
pilot project be undertaken. In May of 1952 the first senior
citizens’ handicraft exhibit was sponsored as a part of
the Omaha Home Show. ‘

Interest among exhibitors (limiled to those over sixty)
and viewers was heartening. The committee went back to

work with renewed vigor. Programs in other cities were
examined. Open meetings were held and were attended by
agency executives and board members, superintendents of
homes for the aged, physicians, old age assistance workers,
and interested laymen. After many sessions a series of
recommendations were made:

1. That a city-wide decentralized recreation program for
older persons in Omaha be established on a demonstration
basis, not to exceed three years. Activities under this pro~
gram should be carried on by all public and private recrea-
tion and group-work agencies, in homes for the aged,
nursing homes, and in other places such as schools and
churches which lend themselves to such activities.

2. That the project be set up with a view of its becoming
permanent at the end of three years (December 1955) .

3. That a qualified person with experience and back-
ground in recreation for older persons be hired to direct‘ the
project.

4. That the director of the project be responsible to an
executive board of seven members, one of whom should be
the superintendent of parks and recreation. The secretary
and chairman of the group work division should be ex-oflieio
members of the board.

5. That an advisory commiltee of approximalely thirty
members from agencies, central religious groups, and club
federations be formed to aid in interprelation of the project
to the community.

6. Thal the oche of the director of the project be located
in the parks and recreation department.

7. Thal, if free space for housing the director can be
obtained in [he parks and reerealion department, the cost of
[he project during the first year of operation would require
approximately $7,500.

RECREATION

8. That the Community Chest be requested to provide
$5,000 and that the park and recreation commission be asked
to provide the remaining amount needed, not to exceed

$2,500.
9. The director’s job should be:

a. To provide, with the chairman of the executive
board, for meetings of the board and the advisory com-

mittee.

b. To interpret the need for senior citizens’ social pro-
grams in Omaha to agencies and organizations and to the
public at large.

c. To provide a consultive service to Omaha agencies
and organizations interested in provision of activities for
senior citizens.

d. To provide some events, city-wide in nature, to be
participated in by the older community.

The recommendations of the committee were approved by
the group work division, and subsequently by the Com-
munity Chest and the park and recreation commission late
in 1952. A trained person to head up the project became
the object of a search which lasted nearly a year. During
this time the second senior citizens’ handicraft exhibit was
sponsored and became a success through the efforts of the
secretary of the group work division.

The Omaha Senior Citizens’ Program has operated with
a full-time director for nine months. [As of May 1954—

Ed.] Progress is largely intangible. There are, at the present
time, several clubs for older people in town, with a total
membership of 1,569. The four clubs sponsored by group

work agencies have a total membership of approximately
200. Other agencies are at the point of provision of leader-
ship and planning for programs. One or two programs of a
Special nature have been sponsored and participated in by
local homes for the aged.

There are three jobs which must be accomplished to in-
sure a coordinated growth of senior citizens’ actigities:

1. Education of the community at large to recognize so-
cial needs of seniors and the value of organized social pro-
grams to meet these needs.

2. Education of agency and organization executives, oili-
cers, and staffs to accept the responsibility for initiating
their own senior citizens3 activities and retaining them as
an integral part of their program.

3. Education of community’s older pe0ple to take the re-
sponsibilities of true senior citizens (i.e., to take advantage
of opportunities presented them and to become once more
a useful part of the community).

From a late start, Omaha has accomplished a great deal
more in some ways than many other cities. Its senior citi-
zens’ program has demonstrated the effectiveness of COOper-
ation between a tax-SUpported public recreation agency and
a voluntarily-supported Community Chest and social plan-
ning council. We are convinced that through city-wide co-
operative planning and action, initial develOpment of serv-
ices for oldsters is somewhat retarded, but that ultimate
results in terms of quantity and quality of services will be
much greater than any one agency, public or private, could
have achieved.

the convocation ceremonies.

Governor Dennis J. Roberts of
Rhode Island, in the convocation ad-
dress, declared that the concept that
government has a duty to serve as well
as protect its people “makes it natural
that we should increasingly turn our ef-
forts to a sound and comprehensive rec-

First “Little Theatre”
Thalian Hall in Wilmington, North

Carolina, is a memorable landmark in
the history of the little theatre move-
ment in the United States. The hall,
with cornerstone laid in 1855, is the
home of the Thalian Association, or-
ganized in 1788 and the oldest little
theatre group in the country. The
building has been repaired many times,
in recent years with financial aid from
the city. Originally the Thalians were
a dramatic club for men only. One of
its actors later became a bishop. Also
included in its list of members have
been a governor of the state and a doc-
tor famed as “a bold and brilliant oper-
ator” in the days before anaesthetics.

Recreation in Industry

0 The recreation budget of the coun-
try’s industrial firms is now twice the
amount expended seven years ago, ac-
cording to the New York Times Maga-
zine. Altogether an estimated $800,-
000,000 is being spent by some 30,000
firms annually on athletic, social and
cultural recreation for their employees.
The companies have found that “play-
as-you-go” programs pay off in im-
proved morale, higher productivity,
lower absenteeism and labor turnover.

More than 150 different activities are
covered by American industry, ranging
from Bible study to beauty contests,
from painting to Ping-pong, from sym-

Athletics are the most popular, with
bowling, softball, golf and basketball
heading the list. Company bands, or-

play areas equipped with play apparatus

than I expected. In the smaller com-
munities and rural districts, however,
no such opportunities were found. It
was pathetic to see so many young chil-
dren working in the fields and in the
shops.” Mr. Hoyt visited with recrea-
tion and park oiiicials in various coun-
tries on behalf of the International Rec-
reation Service of the National Recrea-
tion Association.

Notable Aquatic Safety Record

Representatives of the Greater Los
Angeles Chapter, National Safety Coun-
cil, presented an “Award of Merit” to
the recreation and park department’s
aquatic division in recognition of its
achievement in maintaining a “no ac-
cidental drowning” record at municipal
beaches, pools, and lakes during the
calendar year 1954-. George Hjelte,
general manager of the recreation and
park department, reported that 14,244,-
957 swimmers, anglers, and other rec-
reation-seekers used the municipal
aquatic facilities during the year. C. P.

ELIGIBLE LISTS DON’T ALWAYS WORK*

As administrators, we are vitally con-
cerned that positions in our organiza-
tions are filled with the best qualified
personnel obtainable. We are not only
interested in an applicant’s ability to do
the job immediately at hand, and to re-
late properly to others in the depart-
ment, but are also concerned that he
have intangible, basic qualities which
will make it possible for him to move
up the promotional ladder to positions
of greater responsibility. At the same
time, we want to be able to select and
appoint impartially, without undue
pressure from outside sources, political
or otherwise.

Unfortunately, the desire for strong
safeguards in the placement process in
public service has sometimes resulted
in testing and selection procedures that
fail to produce the desired results. Be-
cause of an attempt to be entirely im-
partial and completely objective, some
public personnel agencies have hesitated
to adopt new selection techniques even
where the nature of a position would
indicate a specialized approach. This
factor must be reckoned with in any
move to materially change selection
techniques in public jurisdiction.

Recreation agencies deal in services
for people. The way in which a particu-
lar service is rendered depends upon
the aptitudes, skills, and personality of
the employee involved.

This is particularly true of the per-
son responsible for face-to-face leader-
ship on a playground, in a recreation
center, or in a camp. Creativeness, un-
derstanding, sensitivity, and willing-
ness to move along with a person at his
own pace result in a more successful
program. Absence of these qualities re-
sults in mediocrity.

Even when a person has superior bas-
ic knowledge of the mechanics of games,

JAY VER LEE is the superintendent of
recreation in Oakland, California.

crafts, nature, or other activities, a lack
of the intangible qualities spells the dif-
ference between a passable performance
and an inspired one.

We have seen a playground program
which has been functioning at a very
average level of participation change to
a bustling and highly creative opera-
tion by substituting a director with ini-
tiative, originality, and leadership abil-
ity. These same qualities are the ones
that make a good recreation supervisor.

If we could utilize selection tech-
niques that would give reasonable as-
surance of obtaining an employee with
the proper basic qualities, much time
could be saved for the personnel agency,
the operating department, and the man
on the eligible list who, because he isn’t
properly fitted to do the job, will prob-
ably be eliminated before his probation-
ary period is completed.

Fortunately, very few public jurisdic-
tions operate without some sort of a
probationary period. Where selection
process does not adequately test for in-
tangible qualities, the probationary pe-
riod must be considered an important
phase of selection. It should be long
enough to allow an adequate appraisal
of the probationer, and should not be
handicapped by undue restrictions
against separation at any time before
the period runs out.

Our need for proper testing for basic
qualities is also present when promo-
tions are to be made from the lower
ranks. The need for thinking about pro-
motion when selecting for the lower
positions cannot be overemphasized.

Some agencies have been experiment-
ing and using newer types of selection
procedures which give promise of pre-
dicting more accurately how a candi-
date will perform on the job. The oral
examining board, made up of at least

r

Conference of the California Society of the
American Institute of Park Executives.

Jay Ver Lee

three experts in the field, is being used
more and more to evaluate the person-
ality, education, and experience of the
person applying for professional work.
The group oral, in which as many as
five or six of the candidates for a given
position appear before an examining
board, has been used in some localities
with evident success. The interaction of
candidates, one with the other, in a
group situation has made possible for
the examining board to make thorough
appraisal of certain personal qualities.
Psychiatric tests used individually or
with the help of a psychiatrist on an ex-
amining board are also being used for
certain types of positions. Other new
techniques are under study, some of
which may have value to the recreation
field as they prove their worth.

Although there are other factors that
will affect the quality of professional
personnel, one important factor will be
the extent to which we utilize techniques
which will measure and predict the per-
sonal qualities that we seek in our rec-
reation leaders, specialists, supervisors,
and other professional personnel.

ADMINISTRATION of SCHOOL HEALTH
and PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS

by CHARLES A. BUCHER, A.B., M.D., Ed.D.

Associate Professor of Education and Coordinator of

Undergraduate and Graduate Physical Education for
Men and Women, School of Education, New York

University.

4-80 pages, 84 illustrations. PRICE, $5.50 ”

This book is concerned with administration as it is related to

the school programs of health and physical education, with
implications for recreation.

Its aim is to give the professional student and teacher and ad-
ministrator in the fields of school health and physical education
an understanding of general administration and of administra-
tive problems in these specialized fields.

It is particularly designed for the following courses:

3. Administration of School Health Programs.

b. Administration of Physical Education Programs.

c. Administrative Problems in School Health and Physical
Education Programs.

d. Orientation, Principles, Foundations and Methods
Courses.

The first part of the book is written on the premise that many
factors concerned with administration are governed to a great
degree by common principles, which may be applied in an

PHILOSOPHY of RECREATION and
LEISURE

By DR. JAY B. NASH. 222 pages. PRICE, $3.50

This book deals with the leisure-time activities of adolescents
and adults. Education as a process is discussed only as it lays
the foundation for a wide range of leisure pursuits. It is a study
of what men do with time made captive through the develop-
ment of the machine. It stresses the startling and disturbing
fact that the great masses of men are both ignorant and indif-
ferent to the debilitating power and influence of this new giant
of commercial mass communication in our midst. The book
presents a philosophy. The treatment is accumulative, but each

chapter is, in a sense, a unit presentation of the problem of the
use of leisure.

industrial concern, government agency, school, public health
agency recreation program, physical education program, or
other organization. Such factors as policies concerned with
planning, human relations, and personnel are of concern to all
administration, regardless of specialization. Furthermore, there
are certain additional elements that are common to the areas
of health, physical education, and recreation, such as legal lia-
bility, leadership, and public relations. These are also con-
sidered.

This book is written with the administrative problems in mind
that confront the teacher and leader in the field. It is impor—
tant that the student in training as well as the specialist on the
job understand the various ramifications of such problems. An
attempt has been made to write this treatise in simple, clear
language adapted to the reader’s experience and understanding.

This book refers to both “men” and “women.” It is not con—
fined to one sex.

EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOL
CAMPING

By HELEN MANLEY and M. F. DRURY.
348 pages, illustrated. PRICE, $4.50.

Teacher education institutions will find in this book a text
which can be used in courses such as camping, curriculum, or
teaching methods, while it will also serve as a guide to the ad-
ministrator and classroom teacher who is in service in the school
camp program. The first five chapters offer information on the
problems in school camping—and their solution. Chapters 6, 7,
and 8 explain in detail the curriculum in school camping and
its importance. The final chapter presents evaluation in a thor-
ough and unusual way. The Appendix offers a number of charts
and plans to facilitate administration.

Edgar S. Bley. Sterling Publishing

As an aid to family recreation, here ”

is a book telling of a hundred different
things which are fun for a father to do
with his six- to ten-year-old boy. All
these ideas emphasize things to do to-
gether rather than paying to be enter-
tained. The author is curriculum co-
ordinator for the elementary division
of the New Lincoln School in New York
City. In innumerable conferences with
parents, he has been asked for sugges-
tions to help fathers find their place in
the lives of their children. Doug An-
derson’s amusing illustrations add
much to the book.

Out of fourscore years of living
packed with service and studious reflec-
tion on the meaning of things, out of
countless pilgrimages to almost every
country on earth, out of visits to gar-
dens afar and years of tilling his own
plot, Mr. Goethe has distilled wisdom
from the garden as applied to human
life. His text and scores of unusual pic-
tures point up this philosophy.

Out of it all comes a deep belief in the

as a way of life, in joy as a daily gift.

“The garden every day offers so much
happiness . . . so few take time to sip.”

“Is not the real task packing young-

of-doors, they will know the meaning
of ‘God gave us Memory, that we might
have Roses in December’?”

At one time, Mr. Goethe was a mem-
ber of the board of directors of the Na-

some of his international tours was in-
strumental in helping to establish play-
grounds in the Far East. — Edna V.

Super Summer

Robert Oberreich. J. B. Lippincott
Company, East Washington Square,

especially when ._it is as good as those
Bob Oberreich turns out. Super Sum-

filled with the hilarious adventures of
four boys on summer vacation. Bob’s
last book, The Magic Lake, was re-
viewed in the March 1954 issue of REC-

he is co-founder and a director of the

knows his boys. He also wrote up the
theatre for us, and his article' was pub-
lished in our November 1951 issue. His
boys and girls build the sets, paint the
scenery, and act in the plays, which are
largely written by himself.

This new story includes a boat trip,
overnight fishing, and a haunted house
rife with mysterious secrets.

United Nations
Plays and Programs

Aileen Fisher and Olive Rabe. Plays,
Inc., 8 Arlington Street, Boston 16, Pp.
285. $3.50.

In this little volume, ideals and
achievements of the United Nations are
given dramatic form through plays,
choral readings, poems and songs. The
danger inherent in combining a mes-
sage and a drama has, for the most part,
been happily avoided and as a result
information and emotional impact are
combined in brief pictures of UNESCO,
UNICEF, WHO, and other agencies.

One of the moving and remarkable
sketches presents the development of
human rights from the building of the ‘
Great Pyramid to the present, using
techniques of choral speaking to main-
tain a throbbing sense of reality as the
historical facts pile up.
