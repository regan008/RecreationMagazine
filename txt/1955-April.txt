Getting at the Fundamentals
of Group Discipline

WHEN WE use the word discipline
here, we take it to mean a process
of change that comes about through the
group of which the individual is a part.
Because each of us has belonged to
many groups since early childhood ——
from family and nursery school on to
clubs and churches, schools and play-
grounds—this process of change has
gone through many stages. All of them
together help us to understand just what
discipline really is.

When I can take part in a group and
feel free when others agree or disagree
with me, when I can be myself and still
accept many other pe0ple with all their
differences, I have developed a measure
of discipline.

Once I have really recognized and ac-
knowledged what is necessary for me
and others, I can think of myself as a
free person and at the same time a dis-
ciplined person. In this sense discipline
is freedom. It is not compulsion. Dis-
cipline in a democracy is freedom. In
a police state discipline is compulsion.
The two kinds of discipline are com-
pletely different.

Just as it goes through a process of
develOpment in the individual, so dis-
cipline goes through several phases of
develOpment in groups and in society
as a whole.

Most people probably would agree
that discipline has something to do with
control. To be sure, it would be difficult
to find an audience that could readily
agree on just how we get control;
whether it should be imposed or come

from within. There would be differences
on how much control is needed in indi-
viduals, in groups, and in our society.
It seems clear, however, that, in spite of
all the differences, most people think of
discipline in connection with control.

A father of some young children said
that control is like the brakes in his car.
If he didn’t use control once in a while,
the kids would run wild ust like his car.

A group leader said that she wanted
to control her children because she had
much to give them in the way of arts
and crafts, which would develop their
free creative abilities. “If I don’t have
any control,” she said, “I can’t give
them anything, because they would
spend their time in destructive activity.
For example, in woodwork the boys
used to take the saw and bang down on
the table with the teeth, ruining the tool
and making it impossible for any other
child who wanted to make something to
use the saw.” She went to the cabinet in
her craft sh0p and took out some inter-
esting objects. “With control I have
been able to direct the children’s ener-
gies into something creative,” she ex-
plained. “Now, instead of ruining a set
of saw teeth, they have been making
these nice birdhouses and boats, and
boxes of furniture for their dollhouses.”

But the matter of control is not quite
as simple as it sounds at first.

A dramatic group in a small town
was told that the idea was for the play-
ers to have a lot of fun and not to be
worried about the performance. Maybe
the youngsters did have fun, but on the
night of the performance nobody knew
his lines, every other minute one of
them peeped through the curtain, the
lights didn’t go on or off on time, the
papier-maché tree fell down and hit one
of the children, the parents were upset.
Did the group have too little control?

Was it wrong to tell them to have fun,
or ust what was the matter here?

One way in which we can answer
these and many other questions about
discipline and control is to think back
to when we first learned to control some
of our feelings. Of course, some group
leaders, teachers, and ministers do not
need to do this; they just seem to have
a “natural” knack for discipline.

A great many things can be learned,
however, particularly if we understand
what we are after and how to go about
getting the results we want. Certainly
the development of control is not magic.
Much is known today about how habits
and attitudes are developed and the way
in which control is learned.

Some basic principles that help us to
understand how control develOps in all
of us are based both on practical experi-
ence and on a number of scientific stud-
ies. We know, for instance, that destruc-
tive or “undisciplined” behavior can be
very satisfying. In our old photo album
there is a picture that my mother used to
show me. Against the background of the
ocean and sea-grass stand my brother
and I, close together, looking into the
camera. I have my arm around my
brother’s shoulder and smile quite mali-
ciously, while my poor younger brother
is near tears. I distinctly remember that
the hand around his shoulder was not
within view of my father’s camera but
was where I could pinch him without
being seen. This unbrotherly behavior
was very satisfying to me.

All of us can remember episodes in
our childhood and adolescence when we

Quoted from Chapter I, The Art of Group
Discipline by Rudolph M. Wittenberg. pub-
lished by the Association Press, 291 Broad-
way, New York 17. $3.00. In his book Dr.
Wittenberg goes on to present further basic
principles which help the leader, and con-
structive ways of using control in groups.

R PPRF‘A'I‘ION

did wrong things, destructive things,
and enjoyed doing them very much.

Also, we know that we give up a satis-
faction only for something that is more
satisfying. “Look, Mister,” said one of
the children playing on the empty lot,
among broken bottles and rusty cans,
“we don’t want to come to your place.”
The settlement worker was telling them
about the line swimming pool, the gym,
and the Hoodlight out on the diamond,
but the gang preferred the empty lot
and the street. They had been told for
so long that they were “bad kids,” that
by now they believed it and got some
satisfaction out of it.

These boys would not give up their
destructive behavior for a swimming
pool or gym, but they would give it up
if the worker took the trouble to make
them feel that they were respected and
were really very decent boys. To be ac-
cepted for what one is is more satisfy-
ing than to take pride in being bad.

For a long time fourteen-year-old
Barbara’s only satisfaction in dramatics
was to have the main part. When she
did not get it she was very unhappy,
and all her parents’ consoling did not
help. Then the time came when it was
more important for her to be accepted
by her grOUp of boys and girls than to
have the limelight all to herself. It was
then that she was perfectly satisfied with
any part, or even no part, as long as she
was accepted by her group and knew
that there would be a good production.
This meant more than the original satis-
faction of being a prima donna.

To be completely accepted by indivi—
duals, and later on by groups, is more
satisfying than almost anything else in
the world. This unconditional accept-
ance makes it possible for people to give
up some of their original destructive,
uncontrolled drives.

Although a group leader very often
cannot accept certain actions of his
grOUp, he will have to learn to accept
the persons involved if he hopes to de-
velop more control. An undisciplined
child or group needs more love and
more acceptance, not more speeches.
Some people find it difficult or impossi-
ble to give up certain kinds of behavior,
no matter how useless or harmful they

unconscious satisfactions that c ause
them to persist in this type of behavior.

Another of these principles tells us
that constructive and destructive behav-
ior are relative terms; therefore disci-
pline and control are not static but dy-
namic concepts. Another way of stating
this is by saying: It all depends on what
we call “destructive” and what “con-
structive.” For example, if a youngster
plays with a ball in the house, it may be
considered all right until the ball hits
a vase; then it becomes destructive.

Take the small child two or three
years old who loves to have his father
make a high tower with building blocks.
When the tower is finished, he runs
against it and knocks the whole thing
down. He laughs when the blocks tum-
ble to the floor with a great racket. Since
this is the age at which children investi-
gate things by breaking them up, this
is really a constructive activity for him.
But if a ten-year-old did the same thing
we would call it destructive, because it
would be an indication of a strong urge
to destroy, and maybe to hurt others.

This is a most important principle in
understanding the concept of discipline,
because it makes clear that the develop-
ment of control is a process, something
that takes place over a long period of
time and that goes through a number of
phases. If we look at a youngster at
a given moment only and see him re-
sisting or being cooPerative, we don’t
really know whether or not he is devel-
Oping discipline, because we have to
relate his behavior to his total develop-
ment. We have to understand what is
good behavior for him and in what way
the group can help him to develop it
further.

Thus we see that whether behavior is
to be considered destructive or con-
structive depends both on the particular
phase in which we observe the indivi-
dual and on the mores of the group.
It is helpful to remember this when we
become discouraged because our efforts
to attain more discipline in a group do
not seem to yield immediate results.

0 This important held is a broad one
and cannot, of course, be covered in a
brief magazine article. It merits read-
ing and study by all group leaders in-

) SECRECATION OF THE RACES IN PUBLIC
PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS has been
barred, as being as unconstitutional as
segregation in the public schools, by
the United States Fourth Circuit Court
Of Appeals. This court reversed a de-
cision Of the Federal District Court at
Baltimore which had held that segrega-
tion in public recreational facilities was
permissible if both races were given
equal facilities.

This separate but equal doctrine as
applied to public schools was scrapped
by the Supreme Court last May. Ac-
cording to the Circuit Court, the May
decision also swept away any basis for
keeping the races separated in public
parks or playgrounds. This ruling sends
the case back to the Baltimore District
Court. It is reported that the city and
state can ask that the Circuit Court’s
mandate be stayed if they appeal to the
Supreme Court within thirty days, or
ask the Circuit Court for a rehearing.

Readers! You are invited to send letters for this page

to Editor, RECREATION, 8 West Eighth Street, New
York II—so that your ideas, opinions and attitudes
may be exchanged with others on the wide range of
subjects of concern to us all. H ere is your chance to
agree or disagree with the authors of our articles.

Quick Action

Sirs:

Our thanks to you for including our
article, “From Courtroom to Class-
room” in your February issue of REC-
REATION magazine. Already one of the
local branch libraries has called and of-
fered their basement for a craft class
and we are starting use of this.

Proposing a National Inventory

Sirs:

I have spent several hours reading
and reflecting upon the very recent pub-
lication of the National Recreation As-
sociation entitled Recreation As a Pro-
fession in the Southern Region. In my
opinion, this is an excellent study, and
for it the NRA and the Southern Re-
gional Education Board deserve the ac-
claim of the entire profession.

For the first time we now have a criti-
cal analysis of the status of the profes-
sion, albeit on a regional basis. The
facts revealed in the study are not such
as to make us extremely proud of our
professional status, but they should
serve to indicate some of the areas in
which we need to accelerate efforts to
achieve progress.

I believe that the book will be widely
read and reflected upon. A knowledge
of present status is the point of depar-
ture toward improvement, and there-
fore it is my sincere hope that the NRA
will complete a splendid beginning by
undertaking, in c00peration with na-
tional professional societies, a national
inventory of the recreation profession.

Please accept my sincere congratula-
tions for this valuable study, with spe-

Recreation and Adult Education

Sirs:

I was most interested in Mr. Knowles’
editorial, “Recreation and Adult Edu-
cation,” in your February issue. I could
not agree more thoroughly with his
statement, “The marraige of these two
approaches to human welfare will not
occur so much as the result of abstract
philosophizing as through the artistry
of our workers.” Is it not time that we
all concentrate on what we are doing
and how well we can do it, rather than
what we call what we’re doing? Here’s
an analagous situation: Is it therapy
when the polio victim exercises his
hands through crafts or is it recreation?
Why battle with terms? It’s the things
that are accomplished that are vital.

Purposes involved? Outcomes? I
would take issue with Mr. Knowles on the
basic differences in outcomes between
adult education and recreation as he took
issue with himself as to the differences in
purposes and aims of the two profes-
sions. There is ample evidence of per-
sonal growth and learning in recreation
situations. Watch a group of eight-
year-olds in a game of Kickball, or ob-
serve the local teen center’s photogra-
phy club in action. On the other side,
the adult education course which
teaches me the art of hooking rugs may
have its greatest outcome in the pleas-
urable social eXperiences involved.

Let’s get back to that “artistry of our
workers” idea. A qualified leader, be
he in adult education, recreation, or any
other comparable profession, combines
appreciations and satisfactions with
learning. Let’s spend more time and
energy on cooperation between the two
fields and less time on drawing sharp
lines of professional “no trespassing.”

Recreation, Indiana University,

Sirs:

I especially enjoyed reading Mr.
Knowles” editorial on the relationship
of adult education to recreation, and I
consider this one of the finest state-
ments I have ever read concerning the
close interrelationships between these
two important approaches to human
welfare.

Mr. Knowles has pointed out that,
ideally, there should be no difference be-
tween adult education and adult recre-
ation. I am in complete agreement with
this point of view. I feel that if adult
education activities are to be really ef-
fective, the participant must have the
right to choose those activities in which
he engages. At the same time, these ac-
tivities should be pleasurable and
should result in self-improvement. If
the activities can satisfy these criteria,
then they may also be properly classi-
fied as recreation activities.

As early as 1917, the National Recre-
ation Association set forth as one of the
seven basic objectives of education “the
worthy use of leisure time.” Since then,
the schools have increasingly concerned
themselves with teaching boys and girls
the fundamental skills and attitudes
which will enable them to enjoy for the
rest of their lives a variety of interest-
ing and worthwhile activities during
their leisure time. There is also a grow-
ing trend toward schools providing
adult education and recreation pro-
grams, or contributing leadership, fa-
cilities, and funds to make such pro-
grams possible. Thus the marriage of
education and recreation has resulted
in increased leisure-time opportunities
for people of all ages.

Robert B. Nichols

JUST AS PARKS have reflected social and cultural changes
in their design, so, on a smaller scale, has the playground.
This design is an eXpression of the social concept behind it,
and this concept appears to be changing. The park of the
fifteenth and sixteenth century was a hunting preserve laid
out for kings, later to become—by royal behest or revolu-
tion in some cases—the pleasure ground of their subjects.
In the/1840’s in England a new kind of park appeared—the
“picturesque” or “romantic” park, which, in America, was
evolved by Olmstead. It arose to meet the challenge of the
industrialized city and was designed to create or re-create
a part of original nature in the midst of urban concentra-
tion and ugliness. This park, in turn, has been modified by
other pressures and today reflects in its recreation areas and
other active facilities a new concept of present social need.

Do we think of the playground as having a history?
Properly speaking its history is a short one. It originated
as part of the child welfare movement in the late nineteenth
century and has been said to date in this country from the
Children’s Mission in Boston with its “three piles of yellow
sand.” In Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1870, the first mu-
nicipal action was taken to acquire a playground site. By
the turn of the century, activity on behalf of playgrounds
was recorded in several cities. Following the organization
in 1906 of the Playground Association of America 1, the
“playground movement” spread rapidly throughout the
country.

What kind of playgrounds were they? What were the
social ideas behind them which were reflected in their de-
signs? The accompanying photographs may give us some
clue. The Los Angeles playground picture of long ago, with
slides and swings, is that of an outdoor gymnasium.

The problem was, of course, health, in an increasingly
congested and debilitating city. In the solution the empha-
sis, as we can see, was on body-building and physical equip-

ment for this purpose. Another problem was safety. The
other picture, of a giant stride, was taken somewhat later
on a guarded playground in a tenement court. It could be
captioned: “Playgrounds reduce the number of'accidents.”
Much heard at that time was the rallying cry: “Get them off
the streets.” The traffic menace was recognized even then.

Safety then, and health, to be achieved through fenced
areas and open-air gymnastic equipment: this was the plan-
ning ideal of these early playground builders, linked pos-
sibly with a philosophy popular at the time, that of the
“energetic and strenuous life” of President Teddy Roose-
velt. The two ideals of health and safety continue today, so
strongly, in fact, that they may be said to represent the
almost exclusive concern of one type of contemporary play-
ground. But there are other types as well.

For a moment let us follow' the outdoor gymnasium,
briefly, in its development. The basic factor here was tech-
nical: the working out and perfecting of materials and 00n-
struction methods. It is generally forgotten that even such
standard materials as concrete and asphalt were a compara-
tive innovation at that time, and their uSe as surfacing for
the playground “floor” was an original achievement. Tech-
nical advance also characterized the equipment proper. The
emphasis on physical development and body-building pro-
duced its appropriate design. Manufacturing skills, largely
in steel pipe, were developed and elaborated with an inge-
nuity and a mechanical exuberance that is typically Ameri-
can. Some of the old steel slides are bizarre in the extreme.
They are now as extinct as the woolly mammoth. N onethe-
less, they are the prototype of the equipment we see around
us generally today.

There was a deve10p1nent also towards standardization.
As the playground movement expanded under municipal
sponsorship, lack of supervision was a problem. As these
new public areas multiplied, it was essential that their fur-
nishings should be safe, well-built, and simplified. Some of
the ancient humanitarian projects of the early playground

Equipment later grew more social in feeling with free swing-
ing and cllmbing in every direction. Apparatus now in use.

builders were dropped (basket-making, rafIia-weaving for
the girls, and so on) . Certain types of the more adventur-
ous equipment were also eliminated—traveling rings and, Q
even to a large extent, the teeter-totter. Other types were of-
ficially sanctioned. There evolved what we have come to
think of today as the standard municipal playground, with
its paved surface and fence, its classic equipment—the slide,
the sandpit, a bank of swings, and jungle gym. Even the
new name of the latter has a municipal ring; it is called in
some quarters the “pipe frame exercise unit.”

In the thirties came the housing authority projects with
their own distinctive playgrounds. The essential problem
for them, also, was lack of supervision and the necessity for
health and safety. They, too, tended rapidly towards stand-
ardization. The materials used, however, were refreshing—-
often concrete and cinder block—and their original designs
were striking. Creative social influences were at work. We
shall return to these later.

Another and even more radical development in its impli-
cations was the amusement park. This originated somewhat
earlier, and has become for the younger children the “kid-
dieland.” Though usually not considered so by designers,
the kiddieland is of genuine interest as a recreation type.
Commercialized and vulgarized in this country to the ex-
treme, it is, nevertheless, a form capable. of great distinc-
tion, as in the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. It represents
in any case a distinctive social idea: that of amusement for
amusement’s sake achieved through color and excitement.
In a society increasingly occupied with leisure and leisure’s
fruits, we can see this ferment at work already. It is bound
to have an important influence on recreation design gener-
ally and playgrounds in particular, such as the use of candy-
striped swings and rocking horses in Philadelphia,2 and
elsewhere.3

There have been two further developments. One comes

2 See Life magazine, September 13, 1954.

The commercial stereotype, standard equipment for today’s
“kiddie land.” Non-creative in concept, it ends in, boredom.

The spirit of modern education is to offer a variety of choices,
opportunities for drama, improvisation, make-believe. An exam-
ple of the new apparatus being used increasingly by public rec-
reation departments is the “saddle slide” at Sarah Lawrence nur-
sery school. Philadelphia has installed one at Connell Park and
has purchased hue others in its drive to modernize playgrounds.
Abstract designs in this new sculptural equipment stimulate the
imaginations of children to use them for countless adventures.

to us from the kindergarten or pre-school, and has origi-
nated in changing concepts of education, which are most
clearly expressed in contemporary school architecture. If
we are looking for the social idea behind the design of equip-
ment and apparatus, however, no places are more interesting
than the small nursery play areas, with their building blocks
and other constructive toys, their painting sets, their music
and children’s books, their packing-box houses, boats, forts,
and climbers. There is about these things first of all a sense
of relationship to the size of the child, a vitally important
element and one neglected until recently. Other ideas are
versatility, spontaneity, a freedom and openness of physical
plan and programming, the encouragement of dramatic and
imaginative play. Surely this last idea had its effect on the
public housing playgrounds. Would the concrete “air-
planes,” “tunnels,” and “foxholes” have been even possible
in the early nineteen hundreds? They represent in a very
real sense a rediscovery of the child and of the child’s own
imaginative capabilities.

A final playground type comes to us from the artist and
sculptor. True, this is mostly in the future. In its most ad-
vanced expression, the “terrain sculpture” of Giacometti
and Noguchi, these playgrounds have as yet actually to be
built. The idea behind them is a rejection of the Hat paved
surface with equipment superimposed above it. These art-
ists see the entire space as a whole, both vertical and hori-
zontal, with the' ground forms and equipment designed to-
gether as part of the same sculptural unity. This implies a
teamwork among artists. Within the recreation framework,
sculptor, mural painter, and landscape architect contribute
equally to the design. To a great extent this has been
achieved in Stockholm, Sweden, in the collaboration of H01-
ger Blom, chief park designer, with the sculptor Moller-
Nielsen. In the Swedish parks, Nielsen’s legeskulptur or play
sculpture, is already a proven success. It has just begun to
influence native design in this country (see photo of “saddle
slide” at Sarah Lawrence College on page 156) . Often mis-
called an “aesthetic” approach, this is on the contrary a
very practical one. It represents a deep faith in the inspira-
tion and imaginative resources of the child and the use of
abstract sculpture to serve them.

We have, then, four playground “types”—if we can gen-
eralize among them so broadly: the municipal, the amuse-
ment park, the nursery play yard, the sculptural. Each,dif-

fers radically from the others, both in design and in the
social ideal behind it.

The social concepts behind recreation design are chang-
ing. What has long been thought of as the “standard” play-
ground appears to be in the process of changing also. What
the future pattern will be is as yet impossible to determine.
In any case, the main stream continues: an ever-evolving
attempt on the part of designers and recreation specialists
to meet the needs of the child. These are needs both of mind

and body; they are social needs to prepare for adult life

tomorrow and to provide creative leisure today. To this-

main stream, all four of the above mentioned playground
types contribute, and elements of each are incorporated.

Our M id-Summer High Spot

MY RECREATION bringing-up was in

the Joseph Lee tradition. I heard
about him from Miss Fonde, first super-
intendent of the Houston, Texas, recre-
ation department, and read about him
in RECREATION magazine. Three years
of work in the recreation department
passed before I met him. That was the
same year I became Houston’s first
supervisor of playgrounds. I met Vic
Brown that year, too. It was a pleasant
triumvirate of events.

The handlebar mustache and metal-
rimmed eyeglasses made me think
Joseph Lee might be conservative and
dignified. As I attended the National
Recreation Congress each year and saw
the twinkle in his eye as he and Dr.
John Findley batted witty remarks
back and forth like a shuttlecock, I be-
came more aware of the great interest
he had in people in general, and in rec-
reation workers specifically. I even for-
got that New Englanders, Bostonians in
particular, are supposed to be laconic,
self-sufficient, independent. Since I was
born and brought up in the Green
Mountains of Vermont, it was easy to
regard such Opinions lightly.

When Joseph Lee left us, it was nat-
ural that his memory should stimulate
an observance quite different from con-
ventional memorial programs. REC-
REATION magazine gave the impetus in a
number of human interest stories about
him. I told many of them to my present
staff and they received, indirectly, some
of the “lift” I received from him as a
personality. Their enthusiasm each sum-
mer, as they approach Joseph Lee Day
on the last Friday in J uly, is similar to
the spirit that pervades our nation at
Christmastime. Everybody is in on the
act. Morale skyrockets as the plans ma-

terialize and preparation gets under
way. The result is a glorious day, with
almost as many varieties of activities
as Heinz has pickles. Such an observ-
ance requires considerable attention to
trifling details. While trifles don’t make
perfection, perfection is no trifle.

First, we make a tentative list of
events at a meeting of supervisors, using
the previous year as a guide. Many ac-
tivities have become traditional; the
program must touch all age groups:
there must be team games as well as in-
dividual events for all; there must be
the zest of competition, but not at the
expense of a large participation. And
there must be a good publicity stunt.

The list is then discussed at the
weekly staff meeting with the directors
and, once accepted by all, it is mimeo-
graphed as a timetable and schedule for
activities. This is later incorporated into
the four-page program which has a
cover similar to a poster; second page,
which carries a description of the ob-
servance and the man who inspired it;
third page, which has the schedule. of
activities; and last page, which has gen-
eral rules for participation. This pro-
gram is distributed to schools, play-
grounds, and all others concerned.

Other preliminary steps taken are as
follows:

1. Preparing a list showing all serv-
ices and equipment required, such as
marking of courts, placing halyard on
the flagpole, PA set, buses for the band,

tables for craft exhibit, permission to
use school auditorium across the street
from the playground, portable stage for
the talent show, soft drinks for the band,
trash cans, permit to close a street for
the pushmobile race, and so on. This is
followed by making out the requisitions
or requests for the services desired.

2. Listing of all props and small
items needed. This includes such things
as softballs, bases, clipboards, type-
writer, stop watches, paddles, tether
balls, and so on. These are assembled
in large canvas bags for transportation
to the event.

3. Assigning of staff personnel and
volunteers to conduct the various events.
This is a real Chinese puzzle which re-
quires careful charting to utilize all
workers to best advantage. The sched-
ule for the program and the number of
events running at one time depend upon
available personnel.

4. Practicing, by all playgrounds, of
the events on an intramural basis, so
that very little instruction is required
on the day of the event.

5. Handling of publicity, which in-
cludes bulletins, radio, TV, newspaper
articles and, best of all, word-of-mouth.

After all the preparation, which takes
the first part of the summer, is com-
pleted only one thing remains—a fer-
vent prayer that it won’t rain.

The day arrives and youngsters con-

verge on the two playgrounds where the

celebrations will be held. Some come in
buses, others on bicycles, afoot, and in
groups in cars driven by mothers. Di-
rectors arrive in immaculate, starched
whites, carrying clipboards with essen-
tial information. The band forms near
the flagpole. Lunches and extra gar-
ments are checked. Equipment is ar-
ranged in orderly fashion within a
roped enclosure under the supervision
of the “props” clerk. (After each con-
test or event the director in charge turns
in the equipment used and draws the
equipment for his next activity.) Craft
articles are taken to the school audi-
torium where tables await their arrange-
ment. Complete bulletins are posted on
a large board. Nine-thirty arrives and
the first announcement to gather at the
Hagpole comes over the loudspeaker.
The program is under way!

What makes up the program? There
is an opening ceremony and a special
stunt at noontime which makes good
copy for the press, radio, and television.
The opening exercise is simple. One of
our 125-piece high school bands plays
while the boys and girls are gathering.
Then there is “The Star-Spangled Ban-
ner” and the Marine Corps color guard
hoists Old Glory. All repeat “The
Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag”; a

local minister offers an invocation; a

address about Joseph Lee; and one hun-
dred helium-filled balloons in the shape
of a gigantic L are released. Each car-
ries a card, addressed to the depart-
ment, with a place to write the name of
the finder and where it was found. The
balloons rise to the stratosphere, burst
from expansion, and the cards fall.

The exhibition events include the
opening ceremony, an arts and crafts
exhibition lasting all day, loop tennis,
a talent show at noon, four gas-powered
model planes in a dogfight and a num-
ber of picnic stunts and contests.

Midget boys (up to thirteen) have a
softball tournament, paddle tennis
doubles, rope climb, chinning, corkball
tournament, pushmobile races and a
tetherball tournament.

Midget girls (up to thirteen) go in
for the balance beam walk, kickball
tournament, short rope contest, dodge-
ball tournament, paddle tennis doubles
and cootie tournament.

Boys over thirteen have a rope climb,

At noon, or at a convenient stopping
place near noon, all stop to eat their
“n osebag“ lunches and watch the special
events which may be talent numbers,
singing, gymnastics, homemade musi-
cal instrument renditions, model air-
plane acrobatics, and so on. Some stroll
across the street to see the craft exhibit.
Free soft drinks are served to all by a
park concessionaire.

As the afternoon wears on, tourna-
ments and contests are finished. Results
are announced on the PA set and posted
on the bulletin board. Special Joseph
Lee Day ribbons are awarded to win-
ners and runner-ups in each event. The
playgrounders who have finished usu-
ally take a dip in the pool.

By this time the press steward has
typed a summary of all events and writ-
ten a lead for the papers; the photogra-
pher is heading for the darkroom; and
the white uniforms of the directors are
a bit dingy. Finally, the sun dips low;
Old Glory is hauled down and folded.
Youngsters are heading home for a
hearty supper. Another Joseph Lee Day
has passed into history.

The story should end here, but there
is a final chapter which takes place in
staff meeting where the event is rehash-
ed and notes for changes and improve-
ment entered in the files as reminders
for a “bigger and better Joseph Lee Day
next year.”

0rganization for Children’s Fiesta Parade

. George H. Adams

THE OLD saying that “everyone loves a parade” proves true
in Santa Barbara, California, when the annual children’s

parade, “El Desfile de los Ninos,” is held. This colorful

event, staged by the city recreation department, is one of

the highlights of the Old Spanish Days celebration, which
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the'community
during the full-of-the-moon each August.

Under the direction of Miss Joyce Gardiner, recreation
supervisor of special activities, this has grown each year
until last August when 1,178 children participated and 150
adult volunteers assisted in the assembly area. Of course,
this does not include all the fond parents who spent numer-
ous hours preparing costumes, carts, wagons, and floats for
weeks in advance of the big day.

The parade gives local small fry a chance to depict, and

to learn more about, the early history of their hometown;
and they never miss a bet. There is nary a dull moment
from the time the Bennett Boys’ Band strikes up the first
note until the last tiny senorita or Spanish don has reached
the disbanding area.

Last August twenty-one groups participated as units and
entered large floats portraying every phase of the city’s early
life—from the missions to such street names as Indio Muerto
(Dead Indian). There were 163 small floats and 29 head of
livestock among the participants who marched along the
six-block parade route which was jammed with an estimated
50,000 persons.

In planning the event, the first organizational meeting is
called in July—seven weeks prior to the event’s actual date,
which varies yearly depending upon the time of the full
moon in August. At this meeting the minutes of the evalua-
tion meeting held after the previous year’s parade are.read
and discussed. Suggested changes are considered, and those
of value are accepted for the coming event. Chairmen for
traffic, safety and first aid, narrators, assembly area, dis-
banding area, tally committee, as well as parade marshal
and assistants, are named. Publicity is handled through the
recreation department.

About four weeks prior to the parade, registration forms
are made available at the recreation center; and each par-
ticipant must be registered and the card signed by an adult.
At this time all groups entering large floats are called to-
gether, and each adopts an idea or event as a theme. (This
prevents too much duplication.) From that day forward,

310 pages

$5.00

It is intended as a practical guide to industrial recreation
directors in administering employee recreation programs
and also for those studying the organization and adminis-
tration of such a program. It is, in addition, an analysis of
the employee recreation program with relation to the vari-
ous social problems faced by modern industry and to the
total community recreation program. Specific recommen-
dations———principles, methods, and techniques——— on plan-
ning and initiating a program are thoroughly discussed.
Program activities, program leadership, financing the pro-
gram, facilities and equipment, publicity and public rela-
tions, etc., are soundly treated in this practical and compre-
hensive report on industrial recreation. In addition, there
is a thorough discussion of the history of employee recrea-
tion and its benefits to industrial relations.

YMCA, the Boys’ Club, and the other local organizations,
start planning and building their Heats.

Most float materials are donated. There is a raid on
orange crates, scrap lumber, chicken wire, cardboard boxes,
wire, nails, and, above all, wheels. No motorized equipment
is allowed; every float must be pulled by hand or drawn by
pets or ponies. No pony, donkey or burro may be over
fourteen-hands-two-inches high and must be accompanied
by an adult. Along the same line of reasoning, no bicycles
are allowed. The cadence of the parade must be geared to
meet the pace of walking two-year-old senoritas. The pho-
tographers must be considered because they have a field day
and no one is reluctant to pose. In fact, before the parade
has moved a block, many of the participants stop and pose
automatically when they see a camera.

The parade forms in one of our parks in the center of
town. There, information tables have been set up and are
in operation by 9:00 AM. The youngsters have worked
long and haid for this day and they are eager. The streets
have been barricaded by the park and street departments,
and traffic officers are on hand to give necessary assistance.
The fire department and Red Cross stand by, to be ready in
event first aid is needed.

The parade marshal and his assistants are stationed at
a street intersection at the corner of the park, and all entrants
are formed in the street, in the four blocks nearest the in-
tersection. The street for one block north of the marshal
contains all the large floats; the block to the east, the small
floats and individuals; the block to the south, all pets and
livestock; and the block to the west, walking groups, the
lead band, Miss Santa Barbara, Jr., float, flower girls, and
other units that will lead off.

At ten-thirty, sharp, the signal is given and another chil-
dren’s fiesta parade is off to the sound of applause and cheers.
Back at the intersection the marshal and his assistants are
moving the various individuals and floats into their places
behind the moving units. This allows one block in which
to correct faulty wheels, be sure the balky burros are mov-
ing, and everything running smoothly before turning down
the line “of march.

Meanwhile, preparations have been under way at the rec-
reation center, which is the headquarters of the disbanding
area. Volunteers have set up tables in the auditorium, in
alphabetical order, where each child who has participated
will be given a certificate. The names have been typed from
the registration cards and are ready for everyone except
those who were registered the morning of the parade. These
are few in number and the names are typed while the child
waits.

The ice-cream truck is on hand and each child is given
an ice-cream bar. The parents hustle them off to their car
and both parent and child have eXperienced a thrill they
will never forget.

There is plenty of follow-Up work to be dohe. Over one
hundred “thank you” letters are written; and, within a week
after the parade, an evaluation meeting is called, and the
chairmen of all phases of the event point out the strong and
weak points and offer their suggestions for an even better
parade next year.

Crafts That Show Imagination

These excellent pictures, sent to us by Gudrun Lischke of Berlin, who has just re-
turned to Germany after a period of observation and work in the United States as a
participant in an exchange program for social workers, beautifully illustrate the fact
that, with care and good leadership, crafts objects created from scrap materials can be
in good taste and quality.

The objects in these photographs are the result of the after-school program where
students from the Padagogische Hochschule (Teachers’ College) work as volunteers.
The program is conducted two afternoons a week, with from 250 to 300 children in
attendance. Crafts and sports are preferred activities.

Says Miss Lischke, “In Berlin there is no money, no material to work with, but there
is a great need for recreation activities. Recreation programs are in their infancy and
are carried on—and very often financed too—by idealists rather than by an organiza-
tion. These pictures show the poorness of the materials which must be used, but also
show the imagination of children. The children who did these works are so interested
in them that they bring everything from home that is not needed there: nails, wire,
corks, scraps of material, old newspapers; and it happens very often that a father who
is also interested sends in an old chair, an old cupboard. Everything can be used, and
the children plan their work with the group leaders.

“The children of Berlin are very fond of arts and crafts. There are today several
programs at the schools in the afternoons, and the children use the school’s facilities, T_hiS grotesquefiglfrea carved

enough to face the problems.

 

We think these pictures give an impression of what can be done, as Miss Lischke
says, “ . . . with a little bit of money, but a great deal of love, idealism and good will.”

IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS

D. James Brademas

THERE 13 no organized public recrea-

tion system in Rockford, Illinois,
a community of 105,000 people, al-
though it boasts of excellent school and
park systems. Recent action by the park
district has added two hundred more
acres of land to the park system as part
of a $600,000 program to provide new
playgrounds and park-playground facil-
ities. This purchase brings the total
area of park property to approximately
1,686 acres, or 81 separate parcels of
land, covering 92 square miles.

These areas include playgrounds,
neighborhood parks, large city parks,
golf courses, and swimming pools. The
park and playground areas are used
mostly by industrial and other softball
and baseball leagues and organized club
groups, while the golf courses and swim-
ming pools draw large numbers of in-
dividual participants.

Local industrial leaders and park offi-
cials have therefore become concerned
about the lack of public recreation, and
a new ten-member board, designated as
the Rockford Boys Club Playground
Association, was created to look into
the matter. The possibilities for coop-
eration between industry and park of-
ficials were good, and the board of di-

rectors of the new association and spon-
soring industrial organizations launch-
ed an eXperiment stating: “It is hoped
that other organizations, industries, and
individuals will join this group of spon-
sors to continue and expand the pro-
gram in future years.”

The board decided to consult eXperts
in the field of recreation planning be-
fore setting up the experiment and sub-
sequently wrote to the staff members of
the recreation leadership training pro-
gram at the University of Illinois. Pro-
fessors Charles K. Brightbill and Allen
V. Sapora of the recreation staff were
asked to come to Rockford for a confer-
ence with the board.

Two playgrounds on the east side of
the river and two on the west were
chosen for the experiment, and a trained
man and woman were to be employed
for each.

The budget for the eight-week eXperi-
ment was 357,500. No capital expendi-
tures or purchase of costly equipment
was necessary. The park district pro-
vided facilities, maintenance, andsports
and athletic equipment.

The bulk of the budget went for sal-
aries, crafts, and general game supplies.
The university representatives had con-
vinced the board that good leadership
should be the primary factor and that
substantial salaries would attract t0p
leadership. Salaries, which amounted
to seventy-one per cent of the total
budget, werc set at $75 per week for

playground leaders and $60 per week
for assistant playground leaders.

Among staff members selected: five
are at present recreation students; one
is in the department of physical educa-
tion; two are graduates in physical ed-
ucation, one with a minor in recreation;
and the other is a graduate in sociology
with a minor in physical education. The
non-academic backgrounds of these
students were varied. Several had been
playground leaders in previous sum-
mers, and others had gained practical
experience through college field work
training.

These leaders worked cooperatively
and with contagious enthusiasm in
Rockford. For instance, in planning for
a city-wide play day, one leader wanted
to bring his group of playground “In-
dians” from East Rockford across the
Rockford River in canoes and then hike
to the playground where the event was
to beheld. He maintained that since
the river ran right through the center
of the city, the canoe crossing would
stimulate interest among the children
and create publicity for the program.
The proposal was modified, but it was
this kind of imagination that kindled
the fires in Rockford.

Many midnight planning scssions
were held among the several staff 111611]-
hers. Playground lcaders were assigned
to instruct at sevcn of fourteen evening
square dances on an alternating basis;
howcver, some of them were on hand

RECREATION

to instruct at all fourteen dances. Two
playgrounds, privately operated and
outside of the jurisdiction of the asso-
ciation, were invited to participate in
two all-playground special events. Lead-
ers from these playgrounds also attend-
ed all of the association staff meetings.
The responsibility for setting up and in-
structing at three additional evening
square dances for a privately operated
playground outside the city limits was
taken on late in the program.

Out of professional interest, substan-
tial financial aid was given to a needy
playground outside of the experimental
program. Four playground leaders re-
turned to two playgrounds in the mid-
dle of August, two weeks after the pro-
gram had officially ended, to supervise
family nights and to talk with parents

about adult recreation clubs and future
recreation programs.

There were many reasons why the ex-
periment was successful but none more
important than the professional com-
petency of the recreation staff. These
were people who had recreation educa-
tion, who were not afraid of hard work,
and had some practical experience.
They were leaders who knew how to
have fun while they worked, who knew
the meaning of human relations, and
who were so vitally interested in the
fundamental philosophy of public rec-
reation that they did their utmost to
translate their belief into recreation

service for the people.

Another reason for success was the
cooperation of the children, park dis-
trict officials, businessmen, board mem-
bers, and parents. The children of Rock-
ford are like the children of many
communities across the country, eager
and responsive to able leadership and
action-laden programs. For the first
week of operation, they came to the
playgrounds with curious looks of dis-
belief written on their faces. One child
asked, “You mean we can play here and
do all this stuff free for nothin’?”

Disciplinary problems were at a min-
imum and were handled quietly. Loyal-
ty to the playground name and to the
leaders ran unusually high and was ex—
pressed by clean, spirited competition
among playgrounds and by actions of
sincere friendship among youngsters
and leaders. Playground safety patrols
were formed and children carried out
their new-found responsibilities well
and with a sense of pride. There was
not one playground accident of any con-
sequence during the eight weeks of op-
eration.

At the first all-playground special
event, seven hundred children were
brought together at one park. Their
willingness to cooperate made what
might have been a trying day a success-
ful venture in group fun. The entire
eight weeks were filled with happy chil-
dren fulfilling a desire to have fun and
wanting to help at the same time. At-
tendance at the four centers totaled
59,000 for the season.

The park district offered the use of
the four playgrounds under its jurisdic-
tion and gave wholehearted coopera-
tion at all times. A telephone call about
a clogged spray-pool drain would bring
a maintenance man immediately to the
trouble spot. Trucks and drivers were
always available on request, and park
maintenance men cooperated with play-
ground leaders at all times. Members
of the association board were active
during the summer viewing various
parts of the program and offering as-
sistance when it was needed.

Many businessmen and organizations
helped greatly by delivering supplies
promptly, by allowing discounts, and
by contributing materials which added
much to the content of the program.
Newspaper editors realized the import-

ance of recreation in the life of the com-
munity and gave solid support. Dozens
of stories, editorials, and pictures were
printed on daily and special activities.
A local television station offered the
services of its studios in presenting six
half-hour child-participation programs.
Each show brought to the public a pres-
entation of one of the major areas of
the recreation program.

One company offered the use of one
of its large windows in a well located
downtown building for a crafts exhibit
showing types of raw material used and
finished crafts items from the four play-
grounds. Many parents were active in
the program and two neighborhood
groups have laid groundwork for the
formation of adult recreation clubs in
order to keep the interest alive until
next summer.

What should be the ultimate goal of
experimentation programs such as the
one in Rockford? The final objective
should be a year-round recreation pro-
gram serving the needs of all people on
a secure, sustained basis. One of the
most important factors in a secure pro-
gram is a permanent staff of full-time,
experienced personnel at all levels.
Rockford is faced with the problem of
not having a permanent staff because
many of the students who worked there
last summer will be looking for per-
manent jobs rather than returning to
summer positions.

Rockford, and other carefully
planned community playgrounds as
well, could serve as a recreation train-
ing ground for young recreation and
physical education students. The bene-
fits would be high both to the students
and to the community. Young students
have many new ideas and are willing to
work hard and to learn. If a properly
planned and administered playground
program blossoms in Rockford in the
years to come, it could attract top stu-
dents from many colleges and universi-
ties for summer work.

Rockford is now planning an expand-
ed program for next summer, with long-
range plans in mind for a much needed
permanent year-round program serving
the needs of all people. Its striking de-
ficiency in public recreation is being
eliminated by forward looking citizens
who realize the necessity of the worthy
use of leisure time.

Try New Ideas This Year

 

Playground
' Plans

That Are Successful in Boston

Patrick J. Ryan

. . . W 542 WWW zeta/acted éamwt‘m

7NTEREST in developing a playground fort and drill grounds dating back into
to experiment with a new phase of history, was ideal in many ways. It is

public recreation—a program for men-
tally retarded youngsters—took form
in the Boston Parks and Recreation
Department in the summer of 1952.

All directors of recreation are famil-
iar with the problems involving young-
sters of this type in their programs—
the usual story of youngsters so af-
flicted they are not physically able to
take part in the daily program of the
local playground. Then, of course, there
is the concern of the parent that the
youngster is not capable of withstand-
ing usual kidding and fooling that nor-
mal youngsters generate in their activi-
ties. An additional concern is that many
parents with such a child are not too
anxious to. publicize his condition.
Nevertheless, the interest of the parents
and the enthusiasm of the youngsters
becomes so great that the Opportunity to
try such a program should not be over-
looked.

When the commissioner of parks and
recreation, Frank R. Kelley, presented
the idea for this new phase of the pro-
gram to Mayor John B. Hynes, the
mayor was most enthusiastic and in-
structed the commissioner to go all the
way.

In going into action, the first consid-
eration became that of a location which
would be public, yet not conspicuous
enough to attract spectators. Castle
Island, in Boston Harbor, with its old

reation in Boston, Massachusetts.

located right on the edge of the harbor,
with a large grassy area and nearby
housing facilities. The construction of
its Fort Independence, one of the strong-
holds of our liberty, was a series of
giant blocks cemented to form walls
twenty-feet thick—not too unlike most
of the early forts. The area inside the
blockhouse was used as a parade and
drill ground. This area, then, was set
aside and appropriately titled “Pleas-
ure Island.”

The problem of personnel was solved
when one of the most interested persons
in this area turned out to be a school
teacher with over twenty years of ex-
perience in teaching retarded children.
Miss Helen Freeman was appointed as
director of the program, and we were
under way.

Parents, brothers, and sisters, were
encouraged to come to Pleasure Island
for the day. The parents developed into
excellent volunteer leaders, and the

Pleasure Island children

to improve coordination.
The program varies little
from that of the average
well-run city playground.

brothers and sisters supplied normal
healthy playmates who did have a de-
sire to play with, but still keep in mind
the limitations of, their less fortunate
brother or sister.

The daily program does not vary
much from that of the average well-or-
ganized public playground, with flag
raising, singing, marching, sports and
games, arts and crafts, story telling. An
important part of the day is the period
set aside for a formal physical educa-
tion program. We have also success-
fully included a “learn to swim” pro-
gram among the activities.

Some of the items listed by observers
of this program are interesting:

0 The parents are the key to the situation.
Their cooperation and willingness to bring
their problem out into the open has helped to
furnish the encouragement and interest neces-
sary in such a specialized program.

0 The impressive therapeutic value for the
youngsters in being able to play together with
children who have an appreciation of their
problems and limitations.

0 The great confidence developed in so many
youngsters from the accomplishment of climb-
ing up to the six foot slide and going down on

 

their own, the participation in running which
helps to supplant the slow shuffle.

o The youngsters who never left home alone

and who now travel the subway to Pleasare
Island.

We treat these youngsters as normal
youngsters, and as we progress we try
to measure their deficiencies and apply
corrections. It is amazing how many
things they can accomplish if they only
have the chance, and, most of all, patient
encouragement.

The day camp is open daily Monday

through Friday, from May 15 until
August 30, and a single day’s program
has yet to be cancelled because of in-
clement weather. It is almost impossi-
ble to believe that on one of the real
New England wet days, we checked
forty-two youngsters in attendance.
The accomplishments of this experi-
mental program have been so great that
the program has been brought indoors
to one of our recreation centers during
the winter. It is limited to Saturdays,

 

because of school, and operates on the
same basis as the outdoor program, in-
cluding the swimming classes.

Parents and youngsters alike are most
grateful for the wonderful accomplish-
ments, and, most of all, happy to better
enjoy life through the medium of rec-
reation. The program is best summed
up in the words of the Mayor Hynes,
who said, “Never has so little been done
for so few that has been appreciated
by so many.”

7HE CURRENT trend in handling juve-
nile problems has caused the spot-
light of public opinion to be focused on
recreation and its contribution to a so-
lution of these problems. Too often, an
appraisal terminates in the net total of
the competitive sports programs and
their opportunities for curing moral ills.
Most modern recreation programs ad-
hereto a “character before skill” policy.
This solid fact came to light in Boston
last year, when, in an effort to present
the better side of present day youth, the
“Citizen of the Week” was made an im-
portant part of the summer playground
program.

During the Recreation Leaders’ In-
stitute, a session was devoted to the de-
tails of operating this plan. Its impor-
tance was emphasized when it was
endorsed as being coordinated with the
mayor’s civic improvement committee.
The monitor, or junior volunteer effort,
was adapted to this idea. A simple, yet
inclusive, set of regulations to be used
to determine the selection of the young-
ster on a ten-point-total basis was al-
lowed for each of the following:

1. Interest. (Attendance, participation in
activities.) To be part of a community, a citi-
zen must participate in its activities.

2. Cooperation, Helpfulness. A citizen has
a relation to those in authority.

3. Kindness, Consideration. A citizen has a
personal relation to other citizens.

4. Sportsmanship, Sense of Fair Play. A
Citizen has a relation to others in activities.

5. Genuine Sense of Responsibility and
Loyalty. A citizen has a relation to the state
as a whole.

Each week during the summer season,
the youngsters on each playground se-

APRIL 1955

lected the boy and girl who scored the
highest points. It certainly meant more
paper work, but the immediate interest
more than compensated. The selection
was recorded on the weekly activities
report, and a master record was main-
tained at headquarters. The program
was not under way too long when the
local district papers began to feature
the youngsters selected in their districts.

The reaction of the youngsters to the
program was very good. Can one
imagine the “Citizen of the Week” com-

mitting some act to lessen his dignity

during the ensuing weeks? The inter-
est of the parents, too, was aroused, and
not too infrequently parents inquired,
“How are you doing down at the play-
ground, Billy?” or perhaps, “I see
where Bob has been selected as ‘Citi-
zen of the Week’.”

The wide variety of selections was
indicative of the value of the program.
Naturally, some outstanding young ath-
letes were selected, but so also was the
youngster who assisted in the arts and
crafts program, along with the young
girl who was the talented lead in the
dance act, and the youngster who never
missed a day in guiding his two young
sisters to the playground. Needless to
say, such a program encompassed all
races, creeds, and colors; the only quali-
fication required was that the young-
ster be a “good citizen.”

There were no promotion gimmicks
or political angles. It was just a very
sincere effort on the part of each play-
ground director to make a specific
effort to emphasize the great goodness

which we know is the major portion of
an American recreation program. The
reaction of the press was wonderful,
and the reporters had a field day in
writing about “plain American kids.”

To the Massachusetts Committee for
Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, this
was too good an effort to be allowed to
fade out; and, in order to assure its
continuance, the committee proposed
to the mayor of Boston that it would
like to honor a selected group of these
youngsters at a luncheon.

The head table invited was worthy by
comparison with any important func-
tion held in the city. lts guests were:
the mayor, who served as toastmaster;
representatives of the various faiths;
the superintendent of schools; the chair-
man of the Mayor’s Civic Committee;
the chairman of the Massachusetts Com-
mittee for Catholics, Protestants and
Jews; the chairman of the Boston
Chamber of Commerce; the commis-
sioner of the parks and recreation de-
partment; and the commissioner of the
police department. The list of invited
guests included the managing editor of
every Boston newspaper, the president
of the. United Community Services, as
well as many people prominent and ac-
tive in the field of civic improvement
and human relations. Each youngster
was awarded a framed certificate by the
mayor and also a notatidn on the school
record of his accomplishment.

Needless to say, the “Citizen of the
Week” has been established as a very
definite part of Boston’s recreation
program.

A Practical On-the-Joh Training Course
for Recreation Administrators

You can take this training program without sacrificing valuable time
from your work—because it becomes part of your work in the day-to-day
operations in the recreation field. This course is especially suited for
group study, from four or five to as many as twelve in one group—all
under one enrollment. Groups presently enrolled in this course include
such cities as Austin, Texas; Evanston, Illinois; and Greensboro, N. C.

The first edition of the textbook, 1940, was prepared by George D.
Butler, of the National Recreation Association. The current revised edi-
tion, 1948, was largely edited by Mr. Butler, with the assistance of other
leaders in the recreation profession. The 516-page volume is a handy
and wholly authentic reference source long after the course is completed.

Games
and

/

Status Experience‘

IT IS GENERALLY recognized that the rule games of children-
play a part in their social development. In games, chil-
dren experience a variety of action-based social relation-
ships; they are given the opportunity—and the necessity——
to assume a variety of game-provided roles and status posi-
tions. Such status positions within games may be those of
the leader, the follower, the attacker, the defender, the
taunter, the taunted, and so on. In general, a game position
of high status grants to its occupant a special game function,
a larger share of the game action, important control over
game play, and special strategic powers. Low status posi-
tions tend to have opposite qualities. Besides status posi-
tions within a game, as a result of game play, there may be
established the status of winner or loser.

a This paper will be mainly concerned with a classification
and description of games in terms of the kinds of status
positions they contain and their controls over allocation of
these positions. Such a classification may make it more
possible to select and manage games so that the participants
exPerience a variety of status roles. Such experiences en-
able participants to achieve some of the gratifications and
the psychological releases which often come when real life
themes are acted out in play and fantasy. Although focus
here will be upon high status positions, positions of low
status also have beneficial experience potentials. To “play
at” being in the dominated, derided, or defeated position
can relieve tensions about actually being in such positions.
Furthermore, the process of going from a'low to a high game
status position—of changing from the “passive endurer”
to the “active master”——can be a personality-strengthening
experience.

Since the kind of status positions which exist in games
can often be surmised by the sensitive worker for himself,
major emphasis will be directed to the factors influencing
allocation of these positions. The allocation of positions
in a game may be affected by three types of variables:

1. Social power, the extent to which individuals can suc-
cessfully influence“ others. Thus, if two little girls vie for

the first leadership position in Mother, May 1?, the more
influential child will be accepted by her peers for that po-
sition. Also, high game status positions often go to children
who are best liked by the children originally holding the
high status game position.

2. Playing competence, or the skill with which individuals
can carry out the essential game performances. Thus, if two
boys strive for the king position in King of the Mountain,
the stronger and more agile child is most likely to win that
position.

3. Game controls over position assignment, or the kind
and extent of game rules regarding allocation of the status
position. Some game structures permit social power rather
full scope in the achievement of status positions, others
make playing competence, and resultant competitive suc-
cess, determine who achieves a given status; other games
have arrangements which tend to assure some sharing of
status positions among participants regardless of their so-
cial power or playing competence.

zGame Classification

The classification suggested below attempts to classify
games in terms of the types of status positions which they
contain and the methods of allocation of these status posi-
tions which they employ. It will be noted that the presented
games classes tend to progress from games which are sim-
ple and most often played by younger children and girls to
games which are complex and more frequently played by
older boys.

based upon extensive observations of play in games in New Zealand
and the United States. The efforts of the senior author were supported
in part by a U. 5. Government Smith-Mundt Research Fellowship at
the Institute of Child Welfare, University of California. Research

Skill Games:

Dramatic Games

These games have in common their emphasis upon form
and ceremony as opposed to the focus upon competition
success in skill games. Allocations of status roles such as
the witch, the mother, or the leader is relatively open to the
influence of social power, relatively less determined by game

skill.

Ritual Dramatic Games. Examples of these games are
Farmer in the Dell (B) 2 and Mother, Mother, the Pot Boils
Over (R) .3 The high status positions are those of the game
director who calls or chants signals and who may choose
others to join him. Allocation of such high status positions
is left up to the decision of the playing grOUp; furthermore,
the achievement of “next-best” status positions (that of be-
ing chosen first) is easily affected by one’s position in the
group hierarchy. Players who are leaders tend to choose
their friends first. Thus, social power and popularity in-
fluence the decision as to what child will enjoy the high
status roles. Playing competence, resulting in competitive
success, is not primary.

It must be remembered that players other than the leader
have a status, too, albeit a less prominent one. Furthermore,
in these status positions, the player is protected from whim-
sical or “unfair” domination and interference from players
in the higher roles. In contrast, lower status positions in
make-believe play are not protected by controls which pre-
vent the socially powerful child in a leadership position

from deciding the roles others shall take and determining
the content of these roles.

Skill Dramatic Games. Examples are Red Light (R) and
Mother, May I? (R). The high status position in these
games is that of a mother or leader who “calls the turnf’
The first leader is likely to be a child of high social power.
After the game begins other children compete for the po-
sition, but they are under considerable control by this leader
who may select the person to attempt the game challenge
and who may determine the extent of the other players’
progress. (For example, the leader in Mother, May I?
grants one player three giant steps forward.) Insofar as
competition determines who shall become next leader, allo-
cation of status position is based on competence; however,
the leader’s control makes it possible for him to favor his
friends and thus allocation can be determined to a greater
extent by social power and popularity than by game skill.

The game-given power of the child in the high status po-
sition to dominate others in the skill dramatic games is
impressive. It should be added, however, that observations
showed that the small groups of mutual friends who usually
play these games often tacitly agree to manipulate the game

so that each player has some opportunity to occupy the dom-
inant status position.

Skill Games

Skill games differ from dramatic games in several ways.
When the skill game begins, status positions are often allo-
cated by appeals to chance which employ counting-out
rhymes or guessing contests. This itself is evidence of the
greater control that the game exercises over social power.
Insistence on game-equality is further emphasized by the
fact that, once the game begins, reallocation of status po-
sitions is governed by laws respecting competitive success
and failure. Skill games make competence in play the de-
termining factor in assignment of status positions.

It Games

In It games, a group or pack works in opposition to one
person who provides the action focus. The It always has
a special status position in such games; however, game
structures vary on whether It is given a high or an inferior
game status. There are Its who have control over others,
as the It in Pom Pom Pullaway (R) ; other Its are at the
mercy of the taunts and actions of the pack, as the It in
Lame Fox (R). There are Its who lead allies against the
opposing pack and there are those who face, alone, the in-
terlocking and antagonistic efforts of the whole pack. In
assessing the degree of game-given status of It in any par-

ticular game, such possibilities must be kept in mind. Of
the possible classifications of It games, a dichotomy based
on the method of allocation of the It position can be em-
ployed; this dichotomy, which applies to most, but not all,
It games, is one of the It-by-defeat versus It-by-triumph.

I t-by-Defeat. One becomes It when he losses a competitive
encounter with a previous It. Examples are simple Tag and
Hide and Seek. Furthermore, one leaves the It position only
when he wins one or more competitive encounters with mem-
bers of the pack. Most commonly the It in such games is
supposed to be an undesirable position; however, certain
games grant enough strategic advantages to the It so that
he may be perceived as occupying a relatively high status
position. One danger in those It-by-defeat games which
do not grant strategic advantages to the It is that incom-
petent players easily become It and may have extreme dif-
ficulty in winning their way out of the position. Then events

in the game are likely to make painfully acute the 'low status
quality of the It position.4 '

petitive encounter with a previous It and he holds the posi-
tion until he loses an encounter with another pack member.
Although the group works against him the It position is
potentially one of very high status. It is a respected accom-
plishment to win the position and then successfully to stand
off the efforts of a total group. Our observations indicate
that such games are more popular with older children (ages
nine to twelve) while the ~lt-by-defeat games are mostly
played by younger children. Perhaps these latter games—
which generally do not have an elevated It position—appeal
to the equalitarian needs of the younger children while the
It-by-triumph games appeal to the needs of the older chil-
dren to play the “beleaguered hero.”

Pack Team Games

Crows and Cranes (R) , Prisoner’s Base (B), and various
team relays are examples of games which are unique in
their general lack of marked high and low status positions;
the games have an equalitarian flavor. In such games, com-
petition among equals is the dominant social theme. Any
status to be gained or lost must come from particular skill
displays or from being on the winning or losing team. Game-
given special functions and powers are either absent or un-
important. Since half or more of the players in pack games
will be on the winning side, this much distribution of high
status positions is assured in these games. Thus, relatively
incompetent players frequently share a winning status—a
status they sometimes gain in team sports (if they are per-
mitted on the team) but rarely gain in individual skill games.

Individual Skill Games

Marbles, Mumblety-Peg  , Freezeout (R), and golf are
only a few of the many games that share the principle that
there is no important game-provided high status position
save that of winner—a position which is achieved by play-
ing skill rather than by social power or popularity. The
only exception to this principle appears when handicaps are
added to the game so that differences in general playing
competence do not determine who shall have the status of
winner. When handicaps are accurately assigned, the status
of winner may go to the player who extends himself the
most or who “gets the breaks.” In these cases, as in many
table games of chance, there is some guarantee of rotations

of a high status role regardless of participants’ social power
or playing competence.

Team Sports

Games like baseball or football containmany game-func-
tion differentiations which are often accompanied by status
differentiations. The pitcher has a greater share of game
action and control than the left-fielder; the position is gen-
erally perceived as one of high status. Among younger play-
ers, these higher status positions are usually obtained by
the most generally competent players, but not during a par-
ticular game. Performance over a period {of time has usu-
ally determined a group consensus as to who is most
competent and deserves the high status position. Our obser-
vations indicate that high game status positions often go to
boys of high social power and popularity. This does not
mean that game status is determined by social power—as
it often is in the younger dramatic games—rather, it ap-
pears, that among boys who play these games, social power
and popularity is partially based on ability to perform com-
petently in sports.

Although there are often real status differences in team
sports, a certain “being on the team” status is enjoyed by
all. Furthermore, in some sports all players share some of
the potentially status-giving positions—as all share in the
batting in baseball.

Summary

Children’s games have characteristics which are quite
relevant to psychological issues. One of these issues is that
of experience in various roles or status positions. It is sug-
gested that knowledge of the kinds of status positions con-
tained in various games and of the variables which deter-
mine who will be placed in these positions can assist the
adult game leader or supervisor. Allocation of status posi-
tions is usually based upon the personal characteristics of
the players such as social power or playing competence. In
some games, however, the basic structure includes devices
which assure a variety of status experiences regardless of
social power and competence. When games are selected and
managed by a sensitive worker, his knowledge of these fac-
tors may better enable him to provide game opportunities
which meet the particular needs of his group to “play out”
various status roles.

Relief Carving

Materials Needed: plaster of Paris; water; cardboard boxes
(oatmeal containers are excellent); carbon paper; nail;
knives or other cutting tool; watercolors, brushes, shellac.

PROCEDURE USED

Preparing the plaster plaque. Mix the plaster of Paris by
pouring the plaster into the water until it forms a good size
island. With a spoon or with hands stir the plaster into the
water until it is a smooth paste. When the mixture begins
to stiffen, it is ready to be poured. Pour the plaster into
the cardboard box to make a Hat shape about one-inch thick.
Insert a paper clip into the plaster-——for hanging the finished
plaque. '

Planning and transferring the design. Plan the form to be
carved on paper. Transfer the design to the plaster by means
of carbon paper.

Carving. Take a nail and press the lines deeply into the
plaster. Round off the edges of the design being carved.
With the knife remove the background so that it is about a

Exploring Crayon Carving

There are interesting possibil-
ities in the large size pressed
crayons as a carving medium.
Simple tools may be used to pro-
duce a variety of effects. A leath-
er modeling tool and the pointed
tip of a plastic handled brush
were used to carve the form il-
lustrated. A penknife, triangular
file, orange-stick and block-
printing tools will be found use-
ful, too, in carving the forms.

The crayons may be carved
full length or broken into short-
er pieces. In either case, plan
your sculptured forms to reflect
the original shape of the crayon.
The nature of the crayons sug-
gests that designs be kept sim-

you choose for carving the cray-
ons. Each will present certain
possibilities and limitations. Try

will do for you. You will find that certain effects seem to
be “natural” for each tool. Explore these natural possibili-
ties and make the most of them. The whole experience will
become more interesting, intriguing, easier, and satisfying
if one will.

A study of primitive sculpture will afford an excellent
approach~to exploring the possibilities of carving the cray-
ons because so much of primitive sculpture was carved from
the cylindrical trunks and limbs of trees, tusks, bones, and
so on.

As a further suggestion, try carving the large size Crayola
and the large chalk crayons. You will find these crayons a
bit more fragile than the pressed type crayons but it will
be fun experimenting and exploring them as media for small
simplified sculpture forms.

There will be a number of students from the fifth or sixth
grades through junior and senior high school who 'will find
this type of carving interesting. [It might be used in making
totem poles as a part of your American Indian projects.—

AME PLAY must be kept snappy and vigorous. A good
é supervisor kills a game before it goes “dead.” Per-
haps one of the worst techniques on the playground is the
carrying on of a game that has lost all interest to the players.
The weather, disposition of the group and the leader, the
nature of the game itself, all contribute to the variances af-
fecting the length of the game. But much can be done for a

game by the attitude and enthusiasm of the instructor. One'

must first have confidence in the game and consider it worth
teaching.

It should be selected for the ability of the group, for a
child feels belittled if he thinks that the game is too young
for him. On the other hand, a game that is beyond a child’s
ability is discouraging, and he soon tires of it. Even though
it is a really good game, it may be that he will never enjoy it
because of this unsatisfactory introduction.

The supervisor must know a game thoroughly before
teaching it. For nearly every game there is a variation or a
different set of rules. Teach rules first and insist that all
players know them that way; then, if variations are in order,
they can be given after the game has been established and
learned.

Introducing the Game. To introduce a game, contest, or
race, call the group together, name the game and arrange the
players in formation. EXplain it briefly, putting the players
through demonstrations of various positions. Ask for ques-
tions, then start the play as quickly as possible. Don’t let
the eXplanation be too lengthy. If the game has been played
before, naming it reminds them of details of rules. Putting
the group in formation before teaching the game makes it
more intelligible to the players. In so doing, however,
always be sure that everyone can see and hear; i.e., if you
have a circle formation, keep on the outside of the circle
and have everyone dr0p hands while the eXplanations are
given. Ask for questions to be sure that everyone under-
stands all points.

It isn’t always necessary to explain all the rules at once.
If a game is complicated, leave out some of the unessential
rules at first and add them as the group gets ready for them.
For example, in baseball, when a group has poor motor co-
ordination, the three strikes for a poor batter or four balls
for an unskilled pitcher makes a pretty poor game. Leave

fields, Bellingham, Washington.

that rule out and let them pitch and bat until a ball is struck
and claimed fair.

Use lead-ups to different games. For example, baseball
is a complicated game that requires both skill and mental
alertness. The skills of wielding a baseball bat and of pitch-
ing are difficult to master. Begin with Long Ball. Only one
base is used and more than one can be on base at a time.
Even this can be taught in successive steps. In small chil-
dren, since the large muscles develop first, the legs have
better coordination than the arms. Hence, starting with a
soccer ball rolled to a kicker stimulates eventual reaction
to the baseball and makes for a more successful game. Next
a large rubber ball may be pitched with the batter striking
with full band or fist. Lastly, the game is approximated
with a bat and an extra large soft ball.

Hit-Pin-Baseball is a good preliminary game to baseball
also, but more advanced than Long Ball. These games are
not merely successive steps to the ultimate “baseball,” but
each game is run in its own right. They are especially fun
to the small child because they require less coordination,
and he can excel in them. As he advances in ability he will
enjoy the game that requires more skill. Discourage all
horseplay from the start. Demand strict attention when a
new game is introduced, and then explain it quickly and
briefly. It may be the supervisor’s ,fault if a class is not
showing good attention. Use a whistle to capture attention
and in starting and stopping the game. It allows freedom
of laughter and excited voices, yet one can guide the game
so that'it is clean-cut and smooth. If interest and enthusiasm
are maintained, any distraction will be taken care of by the
members of the group. If the disturbers can take hold, a
leader is failing to do a good job. Control of disturbers is
an indication of good leadership.

Insist on Fair Play. Rules must be enforced. Decisions
must be fair. Standard rules should be followed explicitly.
The written rules should be available so that they may be
checked before the group if there is room for argument.
Participants may be invited to check the rules, as it makes
for more accurate playing and a better interest. This also
establishes the leader as a fair person whose decisions are
just. Children will give their confidence if they see that
decisions are always justified.

Resting. Usually the time taken for re-forming new games
and making new explanations allows ample time for resting.
When enthusiasm is high, stopping too frequently or too
long kills the spirit of the play. The game should be modi-
fied if it is too strenuous. If the group is getting tired, even
though members want to keep playing, the game should .be
changed to a more quiet type so they can rest and resume
the first again after they are rested. The games will stay

fresh that way.

Choosing I’eOplc. Sometimes it is better for the instructor
to select the teams. In this way, if he posts the list, there are
no hard feelings by the person who was chosen last. If de-
sired, however, two team captains can be selected who will
choose the players away from the group, coming back with

Ernie Rose, 215 Seneca, Seattle, Washington. 1950.

lists so that the order of selection is not known.

Ordinarily players will be lined up in a straight line and
numbered off by twos, threes, fours, or whatever number
will be necessary. Sometimes they may number from the
far end first to change the order. They should be made to
stay in the position first chosen to better mix up the groups
-—friends tend to stick together each time and make the
teams always the same. The instructor must always be alert
to be sure the teams are equal. It makes for a much better
game, competitively as well as psychologically.

New leaders should be chosen for every game, and cap-
tains should be so alternated as to give some of the poorer
players a chance to be leaders, too.1 It takes courage to con-
tinue playing a game when one is obviously a poor player
and never leads the group. Therefore, it is not always wise
to let the best players organize and run the games. If there
be a special occasion, like a birthday, the person celebrating
may be It, or choose the game. 1

If a game doesn’t sell well, the instructor should note what
modifications can improve it. He must be aware of the
size of the area in relation to the size of the group. If the
tagged are caught too easily, he should widen the area. If
the runner runs endlessly, he should shorten the Spaces. An
alteration may save a good game.

Voice. The instructor should speak slowly and distinctly.
Those in the group should stand so that his voice need be
carried in only one direction. He must be sure to talk to
everyone, not only those directly in front of him. Everyone
should face the leader. The children who cause the most
distraction are usually the ones who can’t see or hear what
is going on.

Minor Faults. Small errors in play may be corrected While
the game is in session. Mistakes will often be made in the
beginning. These should be caught during play.

Preparations. N 0 equipment should be given out until all
directions have been given and the group is ready for action.
However, all equipment should be ready. Boundary lines
can be established in the morning before the playfield is
officially opened, and bats and balls can be at hand. Nets
should be up before the group is called together. The in-
structor should never gather a group, explain the game, and
then rush into the shed for the equipment. That is a sure
way to kill enthusiasm.

Participation. Everyone should participate in some Way.
Frequently there will be a guest who is for some reason
incapacitated for active participation. This member may be
used for judging, timing, markings, scoring, or whatever
capacity can be found for him. He will be found eager for
some sort of responsibility.

Discipline. If a child is apparently in need of discipline,
the first place to look is at the supervisor and the program
to see the reason for this behavior. One can be too severe
in the management of children. It must be remembered that
a sharp word inspires sharp actions. Friendliness and a
soft voice and quiet manner are far more effective and will
promote confidence. Every effort should be made to prevent
gaining the ill will of a child, and to make him see that any

necessary punishment is ust. This will build Up a spirit of
respect and loyalty.

Occasionally there is a stubborn case which is more than
the supervisor can cope with. The director should be noti-
fied of these discipline problems and should be asked to take
care of them. Disciplinary measures must be just. A super-
visor must always think of the possible results of any pun-
ishment. Upon sending a child from the playground, all
contact with the youngster is lost and he may get into more
difficulty. The supervisor’s friendship and the playground
may be needed by the child. The supervisor, therefore, must
allow as much freedom as possible unless it infringes upon
the rights and safety of other children, or damages the
equipment.

Too many warnings are not a good policy. He must be
sure that all commands can be accomplished, and then fol-
low them through. He should try first to make all repri-
mands or instructions without the knowledge of the group.
It is best never to make the child conspicuous, or an ex-
ample; he will appreciate discreetness, and respect the leader
for it. The supervisor must avoid any suggestion that trouble
is expected, for to know that trouble is expected is an in-
centive to give it.

A whistle, discreetly used, is one of the best devices for
checking anyone at a distance. It avoids the necessity of
calling out a name, and it is best to avoid yelling across a
playground, whether for disciplinary action or not. Yelling
gives a bad impression.

A respected supervisor will keep his hands off children
for either discipline or display of affection. He will be ami-
able but not too friendly and give no reason for any suspi-
cion of “favorites,” nor will he hold a “grudge.” Any pun-
ishment will be brief. If a child must be excluded from a
game, it should be for a short time, not for the whole game;
his trouble may be that he needs to expel some energy.
When the player is restored to the game, it will be with the
friendly attitude that all is well.

PROGRAM

What the Playground Can Do
for the Handicapped Child

The above title might also be, “What
the Recreation Leader Can Do for the
Handicapped Child,” because in this as-
pect of recreation work, as well as in
all other aspects, the ability of the lead-
er is the focal point upon which the suc-
cess of the program hinges.

In dealing with handicapped children
on the playground, we have found that
an enlightened leader is essential in
order to prevent the other children from
doing more harm than good for the
handicapped child; for it is well rec-
ognized that children, in their naivete,
can be unbearably cruel. Only through
the guidance and control of an alert rec-
reation leader can the playground be
prevented from being a detrimental in-
fluence for the handicapped child.

However, when the recreation leader
is well trained and capable of recogniz-
ing the limitations of the various types
of handicapped children, the play-
ground can do much to contribute to
their enjoyment of life. As a matter of
fact, it can accomplish gains in the de-
velopment of handicapped children that
no other environment can give.

These gains are so“ widespread and
so numerous that it is extremely diffi-
cult to compile a comprehensive list.
However, if we approach the contribu-
tion which recreation can make to the
handicapped child in terms of basic
needs, a number of points 0 an be
brought out.

One of our leading psychologists,
Louis P. Thorpe, lists as universal basic
needs, the need for: physical well-be-
in g; personal recognition; security,
love and affection.

With regard to satisfaction of the
first, the playground can provide for
the development of balance and coordi-
nation through apparatus play and
games suitable to the degree of activity

possible to the individual child. In ad-
dition, manual dexterity can be devel-
oped in many through elementary craft
projects.

Fitting the activity to the individual’s
capacity has been emphasized. The im-
portance of this cannot be over-rated
because the child, after all, has to be
able to experience some degree of suc-
cess in the activity if he is to continue it.

One classic example of this contribu-
tion is found in St. Louis in the case
of a young boy who had lost his right
leg as a result of an early childhood ac-
cident. For some strange reason, the
boy selected weight-lifting as a sport
which he enjoyed more than anything
else. The neighborhood playground di-
rector encouraged him to come to the
playground to help teach other boys
weight-lifting. Needless to say, it was
an extremely difficult task to convince
the handicapped boy that he had some-
thing to offer, but once he began exhib-
iting the tremendous strength and skill
in his shoulders and arms, he not only
won a great deal of admiration from the
other children, but he began to feel that
he was important as an individual.

With regard to the second basic need,
that of personal recognition, Thorpe
feels that it is extremely important for
an individual to feel that he is regarded
as a person of worth and importance.
This need was satisfied in the case of the
one-legged weight-lifter.

Another outstanding example of the
satisfaction of this need is the work
which has been done with retarded chil-
dren on the playgrounds of St. Louis.
The children have been taught to do
some very simple crafts such as weav-
ing with looper clips or other projects
within the limits of their abilities. When
such a child views his completed pro-
ject which, because of the very nature
of its construction, is as good as anyone
else can do, the smile that lights his face
makes the recreation leaders feel that

John A. Turner

they have accomplished something
worthwhile. Further, the child not only
experiences a great sense of accomplish-
ment but feels that he is a person of
worth and importance.

In selecting a project to fill this par-
ticular basic need for personal recog-
nition, again, the guarantee of success
in the activity for the handicapped child
is essential. If the child attempts a pro-
ject in which he has no opportunity to
succeed, the failure will do a great deal
of harm to a personality that already
is Under strain.

With regard to the third basic need,
that for security, love and affection, it
is on the playground that the child often
has his first contact with people other
than those in his immediate family. He,
very naturally, receives love and affec-
tion from his immediate family, but in
many “cases is unable to find the type
of attention that he needs in any place
other than the home. The very fact that
a playground leader takes the time and
effort to help the handicapped child
gives the child this feeling of being
liked by someone, a feeling of security.
When a playground director gives him
affection,the child reacts appreciatively.

For instance, one of the city swim-
ming pools was made available to a
group of blind children in St. Louis at
a special time when no other children
were in the pool. Supervision, of
course, was provided and the blind chil-
dren enjoyed their swimming to such
an extent that their eagerness to get into
the pool was wonderful to see. [See
“Swimming for Handicapped Chil-
dren,” RECREATION, February 1955.]

Thus, with proper supervision, with
a program geared not only to the in-
terests but also to the abilities of the
handicapped individual,the playground
can help the handicapped to make a sat-
isfactory adjustment, to satisfy basic
needs in a way that contributes to phy-
sical, emotional, and social growth.

RECREATION

A New Trend
in Playground Training Courses

Mr. Naab advocates a concentrated pre-season training program that is fun
for the leaders ( and their families!) as well as instructive. Several communities
--—Lexington, Kentucky, for example—have used a similar plan successfully. Why
not vary your usual training program this year, and try something like this? -

FOR SEVERAL years we have heard com-
ments concerning the inadequate
training given to playground leaders.
There has also been a great deal of con-
fusion as to whether or not leaders
should be paid during the training pe-
riod. A recent poll revealed that most
communities pay their leaders during
the training sessions, but do so only
because many of them will not attend
if they are not paid. Many communi-
ties, however, lack funds to pay for
training; consequently, their leaders
are starting without adequate knowl-
edge of what is required of them, what
to do, and where to begin.

Most communities must rely upon
college students and teachers for their
leadership and, in many cases, these
leaders are not skilled in the normal
playground activities. Many of them
are good teachers, but, unless they have
the ability to teach recreation skills, the
program may die. The taxpayer is con-
stantly watching these leaders and, if
they fail to produce a constructive pro-
gram, the blame will ultimately fall
upon the administrators of that pro-
gram.

The recreation leader must have the
spirit of recreation in his heart to make
a playground program successful. He
can be your best means of advertising
and your most staunch supporter, but
an inadequately trained leader can also
hinder your program. Many of us are
familiar with the older leaders’ alibis
for not attending summer training in-
stitutes, but isn’t it because there is no
incentive for them to attend? Much of
the material used in the training course

must be repeated for the new leaders,
but our training programs are essen-
tially the same year after year. We can
hardly justify paying these older lead-
ers just to “sit through” this training
period, so our problem is to make them
want to attend and to share in the train-
ing of the new leaders.

If you and your family were offered
an opportunity for a week’s vacation
with all expenses paid, you would prob-
ably be eager to accept, especially if
there was an opportunity for excellent
recreation activities. However, you
wouldn’t really expect to be paid for
taking this vacation, and we are sure
your leaders will feel the same way.

Our recreation commission in Hutch-
inson, Kansas, does not pay its leaders
during the training institute, which is
held at camp, but does pay all of the
expenses. By so doing, the commission
saves at least one third the amount
spent to train its playground leaders
and at the same time develops a lead-
ership spirit that could not be duplicat-
ed in the conventional training course.

The institute is open to anyone who
wishes to attend, but out-of-town lead-
ers must pay the basic cost for camp
fee, food, and materials. The institute
is usually held at a private or public
camp which offers many natural recre-
ation opportunities. Married leaders
are invited to bring their families and
are given cabin facilities for lodging.
Cots and mattresses are furnished by
the camp. It is at this camp that lead-
ers eat, sleep, talk, and practice recrea-
tion activities for one week.

The leaders are required to stay in
camp and attend all lectures, demon-
strations, and other phases of the train-
ing program. The institute is based on

 

Leonard Naal)

learning by doing, so they are kept
busy with a variety of activities. They
must: complete sample projects in all
arts and crafts that are to be used dur-
ing the summer program; learn the
rules of all activities, enter each ac-
tivity that can be run on a tournament
basis, and draw up and conduct one of
the tournaments; teach simple play-
ground games; and participate in ac-
tivities involving music, drama, art and
nature.

It is vitally important that a sched-
ule be maintained throughout a train-
ing institute, although some changes
may be made because of the weather.
Promptness by the entire group is a
must at meals and demonstrations. It
is a good public-relation policy to in-
vite local specialists to talk to your
leaders. We usually hold these infor-
mal lectures near the lake where every-
one can be relaxed and comfortable.

You are no doubt wondering what
happens to the wives and children dur-
ing the camp period. In many cases the
family virorks with the group activity
and the children serve as “guinea pigs”
for the playground instructors. All
those attending are assigned daily
chores necessary to camp operation.

Outside groups sending leaders usu-
ally hold their own lectures on play-
ground policies and procedures, al-
though experts are brought in to'assist
communities with Specific problems.

The surest way to know your leaders
is to live with them for a week in camp.
You can’t hide or fake personality and
ability in such a situation. You can
immediately spot your weak links and
can take necessary steps to strengthen
the chain. '

Your leaders leave the camp tired but
refreshed, and have a feeling of assur-
ance that they are fully trained and
ready to go. This small investment pays
off bigger dividends in better programs
through better leaders.

Pool Construction Factors

(Continued from March issue)

Pool Markings. Markings are essential for safety and to
facilitate pool activities. Depth markings are commonly
placed on the t0p of the pool coping or on the deck, where
they may be seen by persons approaching the pool, and on
the pool wall above the overflow gutters, where swimmers
may see them. If set in colored tile or other material they
are relatively permanent; otherwise they must be repainted
periodically. Three-, five-, and ten-foot depths should al-
ways be indicated, but markings showing one-foot intervals
are often desirable. Letters should be large enough to be
read easily and in contrasting color to the pool coping or
side wall. The words “shallow” and “deep” should also ap-
pear at the respective ends of the pool. The outlet should
be plainly marked by a dark circle unless the grating is of
a conspicuous coloring.

Every pool in which races are likely to be held should
have swimming lanes marked on the bottom, preferably in
a contrasting color, either set in tile or of the same material
as the pool lining. The lines, ten inches wide, indicate the
center of the lanes, which should be seven feet in width.
They should start four feet from one end of the pool and
terminate four feet from the other end, with a one-foot cross-
mark seven feet from each end of the pool.

Anchor Eyelets. Safety lines to separate the shallow and
deep areas are needed at almost every pool, and racing lane
markers at pools used for competitive swimming. Anchor
eyelets for these lines should be installed when the pool is
built, set flush with its 'wall so as not to obstruct the swim-
ming area, and have a noncorrosive metal finish.

Fencing. All outdoor public pools should be completely en-
closed so that only bathers have access to the pool. Galvan-
ized woven-wire fencing is commonly used. One of its ad-
vantages is that it does not seriously obstruct the view of
people passing by or of spectators at pool events. In case
prevailing cool winds would interfere with bathers’ com-
fort and thus affect attendance, a fence of solid material is
desirable, at least around part of the pool area. Materials
used, in addition to masonry or board fencing, include rein-
forced glass, canvas, or vines on woven wire, a dense hedge,

or rustic wooden fence. As previously mentioned, fencing
should be used to separate the pool area from a section set
aside for spectators or a turf or sand sunning area for bath-
ers. Adequate gates must be provided in the pool fence so
as to permit the entry of trucks and large equipment.

Water Recirculation and Purification

As water is the most important element in the operation
and use of a swimming pool, provision and maintenance
in the pool of an adequate supply of pure water is therefore
most important. The requirements of the state department
of health are among the many factors which determine the
specific equipment to be installed at any particular pool in
order that the water may be kept in a satisfactory condition
at all times. Because of the many technical problems in-
volved in the selection and installation of this equipment,
employment of an experienced pool designer is recom-
mended highly. Opinions differ with respect to water re-
circulation and purification methods, but a few widely ac-
cepted principles are mentioned below. Much printed mate-
rial containing detailed information on technical aspects of
this subject is available and merits careful study. (Some are
listed at end of this article.)

The bathing capacity of a pool is limited not only by the
surface area but by the water volume and amount of clean
water added, both fresh and recirculated. Many states and
the Joint Committee on Bathing Places* specify that the total

nity recreation center. Pool designed by Charles M. Graves.

number of bathers using a pool during any period shall not
exceed twenty persons for each one thousand gallons of
clean water added during that period. Where disinfection
is not continuous, the number of persons using the pool be-
tween disinfections should not exceed seven for each one
thousand gallons. These conditions are usually met in pools
with a complete water turnover period of eight to twelve
hours; in such cases the surface area rather than the water
supply limits the bathing load. As a rule, all new pools 'de-
signed for public or community use should be provided with
a recirculation system.

The Recirculation System. This is the system of piping
which brings the water SUpply to the pool, including the
equipment necessary to purify or heat the water before it
enters the pool; also the piping that carries the water from
the pool to the sewer or back to the equipment that purifies
it again before it is returned to the pool. It commonly con-
sists of the pumps, filters, water heater, hair catcher, chlor-
inator, suction cleaner, and the pipe connections to the wa-
ter supply, the pool inlets and outlets. With this system,
water is continuously drawn from the pool, passed through
filters and other purification equipment and then returned
to the pool. Fresh water must be added only to replace that
lost through evaporation or through overflows which drain
to the sewer. In many, a “closed system” is used in which
water splashed into the overflow gutters is returned to the
filters. Because little fresh water must be added, a minimum
of heat is needed to keep the water at the prOper temperature
———in fact, difficulty is sometimes experienced, especially in
large shallow pools, in keeping the water cool enough.

I nlets and Outlets. The objectives to be achieved in locating
the inlets through which clean water is brought into the
pool are (1) to provide a uniform circulation of water and
distribution of chlorine or other chemicals throughout the
pool so as to avoid “dead spots” in the pool and (2) to facil-
itate the removal of dirt, foreign, and suspended matter
in the pool by causing it to move toward the outlet. The
pool outlet, on the other hand, located at the deepest point
in the pool, should be designed to drain the pool promptly,
carry off sediment effectively and yet avoid the creation of
hazardous suction currents.

The Joint Committee on Bathing Places has made reCom-
mendations as to the location and spacing of both inlets

182

 

and outlets at pools of various types and sizes. Orifices with
individual gate valves have been designed specifically for
pool inlets; they can be adjusted so as to vary the quantity
and direction of the flow at different parts of the pool. In-
lets should be submerged so that as the chlorine rises to
the surface the water is sterilized. Except in small pools,
inlets should be placed at intervals around the entire per-
imeter. In several instances where they have been placed
at the shallow end only, the results have not been satisfac-
tory. The installation of self-cleaning injection jets in some
pools has eliminated the need for any vacuum system.
Outlets should be sufficiently large to drain the pool com-
pletely in four hours or less. To accomplish this satisfac-
torily multiple outlets are often required. The area of the
outlet is usually four times that of the discharge pipe, in
order to reduce suction currents. The outlet cover should
be non-removable by bathers; the anti-vortex type facili-
tates removal of sediment from the pool floor and prevents
the formation of hazardous water currents. The color of the
outlets should be in contrast to that of the pool bottom.

Filters. =The average water supply does not have sufficient
clarity to make it suitable for swimming pool use until it
has been filtered. Pool water that is recirculated before
being returned to the pool must also pass through a filter
which removes the suspended matter and a portion of the
bacteria. Filtration, unlike chlorination, is a mechanical
process. Filters and pumps should be large enough to re-
circulate the entire contents of the pool in eight hours or
less, according to most authorities.

Two types of filters are in common use: the pressure sand
filter and the diatomaceous earth filter. In the former the
water passes through a filter bed of sand under pressure;
in the latter, through a cake of diatomaceous earth (the
skelatal remains of tiny organisms in geological deposits)
supported on filter elements. As compared to sand filters,
the diatomite filters are a comparatively new development
as far as swimming pools are concerned, but they have been
installed at a large number of pools in the last few years.
Many pool designers and Operators enthusiastically reconv-
mend this type.

Advantages claimed for the diatomite filters are:

1. They are compact units, requiring only a fraction of
the space needed by a sand filter.

2. The initial installation cost is comparatively low.

3. Clarity of the effluent is high and is not affected by
marked variation in filtration rates.

4. Quality of water is not affected by excessive head
losses.

On the other hand, some claim that the sand filter is
simpler to operate, whereas the diatomite filter requires
the services of a skilled operator. The sand filter gives de-
pendable service and is reported to be especially effective
in treating water high in turbidity. Super-chlorination is
easier, one authority claims, with a sand filter than with the
other type. Studies have revealed that inadequate back-
washing was evident with diatomaceous earth filters and that
they seemed liable to corrosion because of galvanic action.

In summarizing a review of research on swimming pool

RECREATION

filters in Public Health Reports for August, 1954, Eugene L.
Lehr and Charles C. Johnson of the U. S. Public Health
Service stated: “Though diatomite filters are gaining in
p0pularity, there are those who feel these filters still need to
pass the test of time before they can be given full acceptance
on a par with other proved types of swimming pool filters.”

Disinfection. Pool water must be continuously treated with
chemicals in order that it be kept free from bacteria and
safe for use. Chlorine is generally considered to come near-
est to having the qualities considered ideal for a disinfecting
agent for swimming pool waters. It is also the only disin-
fectant which has been approved by all state health depart-
ments for use in treating bathing waters. The addition of
chlorine by means of suitable apparatus is therefore the
most widely used and satisfactory method of disinfecting
pool water, although other materials are sometimes used,
such as bromine, HTH, and others.

Chlorine makes possible not only the disinfection of the
entire body of water in the pool, but also maintenance at all
times of a chlorine residual that counteracts contamination
introduced by persons using the pool. The dosage can be
varied by the use of proper chlorinating apparatus to com-
pensate for changes in the bathing load. Chlorine can be
applied in different forms, which require different types of
equipment and which may necessitate the application of ad-
ditional chemicals. Experience seems to indicate that better
results are obtained when chlorine is added ahead of pool
filters. As previously stated, chlorine and chlorine equip-

ment should be placed in a separate room which is reason- a

ably gas-tight and if the room is below ground level it should

have mechanical ventilation, since chlorine gas is heavier
than air.

Other Equipment

Space permits only a brief discussion of several impor-
tant types of pool equipment.

Diving Boards. Since diving is one of the most popular pool
activities boards should be installed at all except shallow
neighborhood pools. One-meter boards are most widely
used, but most pools also have a three-meter board. Higher
diving platforms are usually installed only at Olympic-size
pools or at pools intended especially for official competi-
tion. Installation of boards which comply with A.A.U. or
N.C.A.A. specifications (fourteen feet long and twenty
inches wide) is desirable and assures safe, tested equipment.
Laminated wooden boards have long been used, but alumi-
num boards are gaining in popularity because of their dura-
bility and performance. At pools where competitive swim-
ming events are likely to be held, it is suggested that boards
be installed so they may be swung Up out of the way in case
they are located where they would interfere with contest-
ants or officials.

Accidents are caused at some pools because diving boards
are too close to one another or to the sides of the pool. It is
proposed that wherever possible one-meter boards should
be at least fourteen feet from another board or a parallel

pool wall, and that at least sixteen feet be allowed in the
case of three-meter boards.

Ln —: . .
What NOT to do! Features of this pool to be avoided include

irregular slope, narrow decks, lights strung up over the pool,
too close proximity to a dusty road, and apparatus in pool.

Lighting. The installation of lights at a pool makes pos-
sible a longer period of operation and enables it to serve a
larger number of people. Lights are of three types: under-
water, overhead, and spot; and each type serves a different
purpose.

Underwater lighting is primarily to enable people to par-
ticipate in activities in the pool with safety after dark. It
also affords better vision under water for the lifeguards and
enables spectators to see and enjoy evening activities. Un—
derwater lights should be adequate in number and intensity
to illuminate the entire interior of the pool and eliminate
dark areas which become potential danger spots, even in
shallow water. Overlapping of lighted areas may be accom-
plished by placing the lights in staggered positions along
the pool wall. Lights, even though Hush with the wall, should
be far enough below the water surface so swimmers do not
come in forceful contact with them. “Wet niche” type of
installation is preferred by many. Provision should be made
for turning off the lights at the pool ends during swimming
meets. Maintenance of underwater lighting equipment is
facilitated by construction of a tunnel under the deck around
the pool wall, which also affords access to the pool plumbing.

Overhead lighting is needed at all pools to be used after
dark. It is primarily for the safety of the people on the pool
decks and the adjoining areas, but it does not always assure
proper illumination of the pool itself. At pools to be used
for competition, the lights must be adequate so that officials
can read- their watches and record the results. Floodlights
are usually attached to high poles erected at intervals around
the pool outside the deck. Lights should not overhang the
pool as bulbs might fall into it and insects attracted to the
light would drop into the water.

Unlike underwater and overhead floodlights, which are
designed to afford general illumination, spotlights are spe-
cial equipment and are installed at comparatively few pools.
They are effective, however, when used in connection‘ with
water pageants or other special pool events. If electric out-
lets are provided at suitable locations, spots may be installed
temporarily on special occasions. Outlets are_also useful for
a public address system, radio, reading lights, and other
equipment.

Others. Many other types of equipment and supplies are re-
quired in order to operate a pool successfully. Some, like the
drinking fountain, clock, public address system, and bul-

letin board, are for the comfort or convenience of the bath-
ers. Lifeguard chairs or towers, ring buoys, safety poles,
and first aid kit contribute to bathers’ safety. Kickboards,
starting platform, float lane markers, scoreboard, and water
polo goals are used for pool activities. Vacuum cleaner,
brushes, water testing set, thermometer, and oche supplies
and equipment are important maintenance items. The spe-
cific needs of a pool depend upon its size, type, and program.

Income and Operating Costs

Most communities considering the construction of a pool
are interested in knowing whether or not it is likely to yield
sufficient revenue to meet the cost of Operating and main-
taining it. Experience indicates that a pool of good design,
well located, and efliciently operated can be expected to
produce income enough to pay the current costs, if rates are
properly adjusted to accomplish this. In many cities, how-
ever, no attempt is made to break even; children are given
free use of the pools during certain periods, no charge is
made for swimming classes, and the admission fees are nom-
inal only. In such cases the city absorbs the net cost in its
recreation or park budget.

The 1954 study of outdoor swimming pools conducted by
the Conference for National Cooperation in Aquatics show-
ed that for a group of ninety—one pools of different types,
sizes, and locations, fifty-six were Operated at a loss, four
broke even, and thirty-one yielded a profit. At only two
pools out of twenty-one with less than 6,000 square feet of
water area did income exceed operating costs. There was
very little difference, however, between the average annual
cost and the average income for all pool groups above 6,000
square feet except for the oversize pools. For the group as
a whole, the ratio between cost and income did not differ
greatly from that revealed in a 1940 study when the average
cost of operating 555 pools exceeded by about twenty per
cent the average income per pool.

Admission fees for children are usually ten or fifteen
cents, although a few pools may require a fee as high as
twenty-five cents. Fees for adults generally vary from
twenty-five to fifty cents, with an average nearer the lower

184

figure. An intermediate fee is charged in many cities for
j uniors—usually boys and girls of secondary school age. At
some pools season tickets for an individual or for a family
are sold at a rate that greatly reduces the cost per swim if
the pool is used frequently.

Important Considerations

A few final suggestions as to procedure for any commu-
nity or group considering the construction of a pool are:

1. Visit several communities with pools, preferably while
they are in operation, and learn about their good features
and the errors in design and construction by talking with
the people who operate and use them.

2. Secure and study thoroughly the best available printed
material with reference to pool design, construction, opera-
tion, and use.

3. Get in touch with your local and state health depart-
ments to learn of any regulations relating to swimming pools.

4. Enlist the advice of individuals eXperienced as partici-
pants or teachers of aquatic activities in determining the
major and secondary uses the proposed pool should serve
and the type and size of pool that will best serve them.

5. Secure the services of a competent, eXperienced pool
designer to plan your pool and review his plans in the light
of the best material relating to pool “standards before ap-

° proving them. Preparation of a check list of items that need

to be considered and equipment that needs to be provided
facilitates this procedure.

6. Develop and secure approval for a plan for financing,
operating and maintaining the pool before your contract to
build one.

7. Make certain that proper specifications are prepared
for construction and equipment and that workmanship and
materials are guaranteed.

8. Provide for continuous inspection of all work as con-
struction progresses to make sure that it meets specifications
and will be satisfactory when completed.

9. Arrange for a program of public information which
will assure the peeple you are preparing a pool where they
can swim for fun, health, and safety.

Prevention of Water Accidents

The drowning rate per population in
the United States has been cut in half
in the past forty years, despite the fact
that the number of people using aquatic
facilities has multiplied many times.

This remarkable accomplishment can
be attributed to many factors—the pri-
mary one is doubtless the efforts made
by the many organizations concerned
with health, safety, and recreation.

Following the war, interest in swim-
ming' increased steadily, as it has to the
present day. Many new pools are being

added, not only by the YMCA and the
YWCA, but also by boys’ clubs, com-
munity centers, service clubs, schools
and colleges, recreation departments,
and other community groups.

While initially the efforts of the Red
APRIL 1955

Cross, and to some extent that of other
organizations, had been primarily in
lifesaving, it soon became apparent that
a more basic need existed: to teach
more people how to swim so aquatic ac-
cidents could be prevented. As a result,
many organizations increased their ed-
ucational efforts in this field.

Pools operated by municipal recrea-
tion and park departments are utilized
not only for learn-to-swim programs
but for training of lifeguards, instruc-
tors, and others.

The need for water safety education

exists in every community. Many per- -

sons who may not have an opportunity
to participate in aquatics in their own
community spend some time each year
at beaches, pools, lakes, or streams
—and are exposed to possible hazards.

Although the rate has been cut in
half, drowning is still a major cause of
accidental deaths. More than six thou-
sand persons die from drowning each
year — about half in swimming acci-
dents and about half in other types, in-
cluding a large percentage involving
small craft.

Obviously, there is still much to be
done. While formal teaching programs
may not always be possible because of
lack of facilities, much can be accom-
plished through widespread public edu-
cation. Many organizations already car-
ry on effective programs -using demon-
strations, posters, pamphlets, movies,
and various other publicity media.

dents” by Richard L. Brown, Public

Boxes

Pottstown, Pennsylvania

In this community, the recreation
commission operates- several play-
grounds which do not have enclosed
shelters. Consequently, we have had to
devise some means of safe storage for
equipment and supplies.

Two types of boxes have been used.
The first is made of wood, and is actu-
ally a surplus Army Signal Corps field
desk with compartments removed.
These boxes are sturdy and large
enough to hold a considerable amount
of equipment. Two hasps and padlocks
are used to secure each box, and the
box is anchored. The second box is
about the same size as the wooden box,
but is made of 1743,-inch steel-sheet, weld-
ed together. One long side is hinged
(the hinges are on the inside of the
box) and is secured with two hasps and
padlocks. This type of box is much
heavier, but also considerably more se-
cure, than the wooden box.

If the boxes are not kept under a roof,
it is wise to use some method of water-

proofing. Roofing paper can be used to .

cover the wooden boxes. With the metal
box, we use a sheet of plastic material
inside the box, covering the supplies.—
ROBERT REIS, Director of Recreation.

Prince Georges County, Maryland

Here are two types of playground
equipment boxes (Illustration 1) that
have been used on our playgrounds

which do not have any other types of

This box ( Illustration II) will hold

all normal playground equipment such
as croquet, playground balls, bats, nets,
paddles, checkers, limited craft supplies,
and so on. We bolt all hinges from the
inside and nail galvanized tin strips on
all corners for added protection. Put-
ting galvanized tin over the lid of the
box makes it suitable for leaving out-
doors during all kinds of weather.

We try wherever possible, when shel-
ter houses were not available, to leave
the equipment box on a neighbor’s
porch or in their garage. If this is im-
possible, this particular box could be
chained to a large tree or some piece of
permanent equipment—JAMES A. PET-
ERSON, Superintendent of Recreation.

Great Lakes District
Here is a sketch ( Illustration [1]) of

a playground box used for a number of
years. Instead of storing equipment in
a school building -we found that a box in
the playground served the whole school
in a much better way. We also used the
boxes in isolated parks.

Over a five-year period we did not
have a single instance of youngsters
breaking into them. We found that we
could nip this in the bud by having
a checkout system. Youngsters who

APRIL 1955

wanted to borrow a ball for overnight
or over a week-end could do so by just
asking. As this was generally known,
the reason for breaking in was gone.
Eight of these boxes were scattered
around at schools and parks. They were
made out of tongue-and-groove siding
with a good frame of 2-by-4 lumber.
The hasp was bolted on and well braced,

with the threads scored so nuts wouldn’t
come off. We painted them a pleasing
color both inside and out to further in-
sure their being watertight (at least two
coats of paint). The box is heavy
enough so it can’t be turned over easily.

The inside may be partitioned to suit
equipment to be stored. We always kept
an inventory sheet on the lid which was
easily read when the lid was up; and the
leader could check contents quickly be-
fore closing at the end of a period or
session. When the season was over,..
three or four of our men loaded the
boxes on a truck and stored them.—
JOHN COLLIER, Great Lakes District
Representative, National Recreation As-
sociation.

We use casket packing boxes on our
playgrounds. If they are stood on end
with hinges put on the lid, they look like
an outdoor closet. Paint can give them
an attractive appearance. They are
about the size of a telephone booth and
they cost about fifteen dollars—unless
you have a c00perative funeral parlor

tendent of Recreation and Parks.

For the last ten years, we have used
equipment boxes on five playgrounds.

During these years we have done much
experimenting. We now have develop-
ed a standard box which fits our needs
( Illustration IV).

The size has been determined by the
size of the truck used in transporting
the boxes. The inside measurements are
3 by 3 by 8 feet. They are placed on
rollers or dolly casters and weigh about
500 pounds. The rollers make for easier
movement of the box and give the nec-
essary elevation from the ground. The
. reason for the weight is to prevent van-
dals from moving it. In addition, where
possible, we chain the box to a pole or
fence to prevent further vandalism.
Four men are to handle the box.

We make our own boxes; materials
cost approximately forty-five dollars
with total cost about one hundred dol-
lars depending upon the number of
boxes made. The wood used in making
the box is a tongue-and-groove siding
of 1- by 6-inch yellow pine, with neces-
sary frame of 2-by-2 lumber. Life of
these boxes is ten years, with minor file-
pairs made yearly (such as replacing
hinges, locks, board, and so on). After
ten years, the box needs over all, repair-
ing at approximately one-half the initial
cost.

The box and lid, or sometimes just
the lid, are covered with.‘twenty-two-
gauge galvanized sheet metal. The metal
is painted for better appearance. The
lid is in two sections foi' easier manipu-

lation. Each half is held by a strap
hinge, and lids are individually locked.
The lid overhangs the box by 11/2 inches
to protect from rain. The metal cover-
ing one half of the lid overlaps the other
half by 11/; inches, again to protect
from rain.

Inside, the box has a board on either
side on which an 18- by 12- by 36-inch
movable craft box rests. 0n the oppos-
ite side is a partitioned area for storage
of chlorine (if needed). The remain-
ing area is used for all necessary play
equipment.

In addition to the above, there are
holes drilled on either side so that vol-
leyball and paddle tennis standards may
be slid into the box and then locked
inside for security. The height of these
holes in the box is determined by the
size of the base of these standards.—
HERB A. DAVIS, Superintendent, Public
Recreation Commission.

Sioux City, Iowa

Five years ago our department of
public recreation solved its problem of
equipment storage on playgrounds
where no permanent storage facilities
were available. We built eight upright
sheds with slanting metal-covered roofs,
two 16- by 70-inch front doors, and four
shelves in each. These were constructed
by a local lumber yard at a total cost of
approximately seventy dollars per shed.
Each is 6 feet 4 inches high in front and

Sheds can be moved by a truck, are set

5 feet 9 inches high in back, 38 inches
deep, and 52 inches Wide. All hasps and
hinges are bolted and the ends of the
carriage bolts are riveted. Some of the
sheds have one hasp and some two, for
locking purposes. Each is mounted on
a 4- by 8-inch skid-type runner and has
a door made of 11/3-inch material. These
sheds may be moved easily on a truck.
They are taken to the grounds each sum--
mer and fastened to two wooden posts
to prevent their being tipped over. The
shelves are spaced: first, 38 inches from
the floor; second, 12 inches above the
first; third, 12 inches above the second;
fourth, 15 inches above the third.
Shelves are 20 inches wide, leaving 15
inches from shelf edge to door opening.

There are many advantages to these
sheds over the old boxes previously
used. Each shelf is designated for cer-
tain equipment so it is easy to keep it
sorted; the pails, and so on, are kept on
the floor, and the space between the
edges of the shelves and the door is ade‘
quate for the rakes, shovelshbrooms and
taller equipment. The inside of the shed
may be kept in good order at all times
and equipment is easy to find. Bulletin
boards may he posted on the end or
back of the shed.

All of our sheds are now five years

easily last another five to ten years. We

Rural Playgrounds

Ill

MANY RECREATION departments operate more than six-
teen playgrounds, other departments have high hopes
of someday expanding and developing that number.

Three years ago a small community in Hempfield Town-
ship, the largest township in Pennsylvania, organized a play-
ground committee. This committee raised money by vari-
ous means to purchase playground equipment. It also em-
ployed a supervisor for a few hours per day; however, be-
cause of the high leadership expense, the committee appealed
to the school board for aid. During the following playground
season, the school board provided one director for the play-
ground. Other community groups in the township began
querying the school board regarding recreation for the
whole township, such as was being conducted in the neigh-
boring cities of Jeannette and Greensburg.

The school board, in November 1953, after investigating
the possibilities and discovering that local people desired
recreation, employed a full-time, professionally-trained, rec-
reation director and requested the township supervisors to
appoint a recreation commission according to Pennsylvania
law. This was done.

For six months the director devoted his entire time to
organizing and meeting with township recreation groups;
and the ground work and foundation for a program devel-
oped. One might believe that organizing these small groups
would be practically impossible; however, it was discovered
that it is no harder than organizing a local church group.
The following procedure was used and is strongly recom-
mended. First, a meeting on recreation in general was
called for all persons residing in the township. It was an-
nounced by newspapers, radio, personal contacts, and notes
taken home by school children. As each person entered the
meeting he was given a card to be filled out with his name,
address, phone number, and local area. The cards were
collected by the recreation director and, after arranging by
areas, these peOple became his contacts.

He made appointments to meet with these persons in
each area to discuss the philosophy of recreation generally.
A date was set for another meeting at which time the con-
tact people would arrange the meeting place and see that
the local residents were present. The director would speak
on “Playgrounds and Recreation in Your Area.”

Attendance was excellent. Upon completion of his talk,
in each case, a vote was taken for or against recreation for

sion education for H empfield Township, Pennsylvania.

that area. Almost all groups voted “Yes.” Tentative oHicers
were elected and began to make plans with their groups.

This procedure sounds smooth on paper but, as in any-
thing new, we had our problems. Some of the communities
didn’t have any clubs or organizations; in some cases neigh-
bors didn’t even speak to each other. However, the philoso-
phy of pitching in together to develop a playground for their
children has broken the ice, and many an old feud between
families no longer exists. Some of the recreation commit-
tees have already enlarged to become civic associations.
In other areas a local group such as parent-teachers, garden
club, or firemen’s group formed the nucleus for organizing
a playground; but already, owing to expanding interest and
eXpenses to be met, the local playground has incorporated
the help of all residents.

In this particular township-wide recreation program, the
school board appropriated $25,000 to be used for qualified
personnel only. The recreation commission recommended
the playground personnel to the school board.

Each local playground group was required to raise funds,
purchase or lease land for the playground, purchase facili-
ties and equipment. The recreation commission assisted
them whenever requested. Bulletins on the following sub-
jects were prepared and sent to all local groups: Suggested
Constitution for Local Recreation Councils; Ways and
Means of Raising Money; Recommended Minimum Facili-
ties and Equipment—Estimated Prices and Discounts; Play-
ground Area and Space Requirements; Facts to Consider
When Planning a Playground; Home-made, Inexpensive
Equipment and Facilities; Insurance; First Aid Kit; Prog-
ress Reports.

It is interesting to note that we in Pennsylvania receive
state aid. In this particular program the reimbursement fac-
tor is seventy-seven per cent. This means that the residents of
the township pay, via school tax, approximately $5,500 for
the recreation program. The total summer playground at-
tendance for the season was 67,103. Another interesting
method of figuring is that if each child or grown-up who
attended our playgrounds was charged eight cents per each
session attended, of approximately two-and-one-half to three
hours in length, the entire year-round recreation program
costs would be met.

With these facts—along with the program and that part
of the program which cannot be shown on paper, such as
cooperation among communities, the child’s happiness, at-
titude change, personality, and so on—one cannot help but
recognize recreation offers tremendous values at low cost.

EFFECTIVE
LEARNING

Theodore R. Deppe

HOW CAN we best transmit new ideas, new inspiration, and
new techniques to our recreation workers? How can
we develop the maximum potentialities of each of our work-
ers? How can our in-service training programs be made
more real, effective, and significant? Those of us charged
with these responsibilities face a tremendous challenge. It
is not an easy task. It cannot be done in a slip-shod manner.
All of us must be on the lookout for new ideas or tech-
niques that will vitalize our in-service training programs.
The proper use of audio-visual materials can do much in
reaching this objective. Audio-visual materials have limit-
less possibilities; their use is restricted only by our lack of
knowledge and skill in using them.

Much can be learned from those who have pioneered in
the use of audio-visual materials in the fields of advertising,
education, and business. The effective use of these by the
Armed Forces and by industry during World War II did
much to stimulate their use. Recreation administrators have
only begun to explore the potential of these teaching aids.
Perhaps, because of the lack of understanding of the proper
use of these materials, many of us have been guilty of misus-
ing them or not using them at all.

It must be recognized that audio-visual materials offer
no cure-all for important in-service training programs. They
are, however, tools which, when properly used, will con-
tribute toward a more effective program. Some of the audio-
visual aids available to us:

Still Pictures

The simplest of all audio-visual materials are still pictures.
All departments, regardless of size, have access to maga-
zines, newspaper clippings, catalogues, photographs, and so
on; therefore a splendid collection of pictorial materials
can be accumulated at very little expense. It is wise to keep
these pictures in manila folders until a use can be found for
them.

THEODORE R. DEPPE is assistant professor of recreation at
Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana.

194-

The mounting and filing of still pictures are highly de-
sirable and provide for more effective use. Cardboard or
posterboard, cut in eight-and one-half- by eleven-inch pieces,
makes an excellent backing for mounting. Cardboard in
this size will fit into most standard files. The use of rubber
cement or dry mount tissue (the latter can be obtained at
most photographic shops) provides the best methods of
mounting the pictures to the backing. In using dry mount
tissue, a dry mount press or simply a flat iron can be used.
This method, used for years by photographers for mounting
photographic materials, assures the most permanent and
professional job.

There are many ways that mounted pictures can be used
in your training program. They can be displayed on a bul-
letin board or a peg board to give employees new ideas.
The peg board, which is taking the visual-aids field by storm,
is basically a sheet of composition or masonite board with
holes punched all over it. Pegs (golf tees will work) are
fitted into these holes, which in turn are used to support
your mounted still pictures, pamphlets, and other objects
desired for a display. The next time you go downtown shop-
ping, notice the efiectiveness of peg boards in displaying
products and sales literature.

Sandpaper, felt, or Hock paper can be glued on the back
of the mounted picture so that it is possible to use the pic-
ture with the flannel or felt board in a demonstration talk
before your employees.

In using still pictures before larger groups, problems are
presented. If you hold the picture up in front of the group,
as is often done, it is too small to be seen by those in the
group. Passing the picture around creates confusion and
loss of interest. This problem can be solved by placing the
mounted picture in an opaque projector which projects it
onto a screen. Another advantage of having the picture
mounted is that the picture will not buckle, and the focus
will be much sharper. With the picture projected onto the
screen, all members of the group can focus their attention
on the picture at once.

Many excellent pictures that cannot be removed from

RECREATION

 

Dr. Deppe employs flannel board during a demonstration to
show students in training the proper layout of a playground.

books or magazines can be effectively used in a group by the
use of the opaque projector. A book or magazine can be
placed in the projector.

Protection of mounted pictures can be insured by the use
of artist fixative, clear plastic spray, wallpaper lacquer, and
so on. This covering will permit the cleaning of the surface
and will protect it from moisture. Products of this type may
be obtained from your local art, stationery, or paint store.

Posters

By merely adding hand or mechanical lettering to the
mounted pictures, effective posters can be made. Posters,
properly displayed, are attention-getters and are informa-
tional in nature. Their value in public relations is already
recognized and used to a great extent by most departments.

You, no doubt, are familiar with various methods of pro-

I ducing posters. They vary from the simple poster made by
3 adding lettering to still pictures to a more detailed photo-
1 graphic poster. Most recreation administrators can increase
Ithe quality and effectiveness of their posters by becoming
lfamiliar with the variety of lettering devices available on
lthe market. There are approximately one hundred lettering
Dmethods used in the country today. They can be classified
linto several different types, such as: (1) stencils, (2) cut-
Iout paper, (3) plastic, cardboard, and cork letters, (4)

gummed back letters, (5) mechanical traced lettering, and
f (6) pasteup letters.*

Slides and Filmstrips

Slides and filmstrips, to a lesser extent, are used by many
of the recreation leaders as training aids. Both provide
excellent group participation opportunities if properly used.
There are two types of slides available: the 2- by 2-inch pho-
‘tographic slide and the 314- by 4-inch lantern slide. Each
can be easily and inexpensively made. Filmstrips are more
costly and difficult to produce, but there are many sources
available where filmstrips can be rented or purchased for

companies handling lettering materials and equipment upon request.

a very reasonable amount. Projectors are available that
will project both types of slides as well as filmstrips. If your
department is not fortunate enough to have such a projector,
you might get in touch with the public schools in your com-
munity. If you have maintained proper public relations with
your school system (and you should), you no doubt will -
be able to borrow a projector.

Motion Pictures

Films should be taught, not merely shown. If properly
utilized, motion pictures are one of our best motivation
devices and are effective in furnishing information and
forming desirable attitudes. Motion pictures, more than any
other audio-visual material, have been misused. How often
have you witnessed a film being shown with no particular
purpose, no introduction of the film, faulty projection, and
little, if any, follow up afterward.

In using films, the following suggestions should be fol-
lowed for best results:

1. First, you should consider whether a film is the most ef-
fective medium available to accomplish the purpose desired.

2. Always preview the film before showing it to your em-
ployees.

3. Properly introduce the film; prepare the group for it.
Discuss the purpose of the film and what to look for in it.

4. Seek to get the best possible projection of the film. Use
properly trained operators. A smooth performance makes
for the best possible use.

5. Provide for a definite follow up. The film might pro-
voke an active discussion among employees. In some in-
stances, a demonstration would be apprOpriate.

The film, like most audio-visual materials, is not self-
teaching; a great deal of its effectiveness will be lost if the
above suggestions are not followed.

Motion pictures are expensive to produce; however, many
departments have produced films which are used for train-
ing purposes. By and large, most departments should con-
sider the professional films available for use in their in-
service training programs. Many state universities have
audio-visual departments with extensive film libraries. The
best and most complete film reference book is the Educa-

tional Film Guide published by the H. W. Wilson Company,
950 University Avenue, New York 52. The Educator’s Guide

to Free Films, published by the Educators Progress Service,
Randolph, Wisconsin, is one Of the best soumes of free films.
Both references are usually available in most of the public
libraries.

There are many other facets in this broad field. Audio-
visual materials provide a most fascinating and challenging
attraction to those administrators concerned with training
recreation leaders in service. The techniques mentioned and
many more are available to us. Use them in training your
leaders, but the important thing is: use them properly.

Form-A-Stage, a portable prefabri-
cated stage of all-steel construction,
quickly and easily erected with only one
tool (a wrench), is the new “answer-to-
a-prayer” of those called upon (some-
times at a minute’s notice) to put up
such a unit for a band concert, show, or

the F orm-A-Stage are cut to exact size
and fall into place smoothly and speed-

Dual Purpose Hydrant Sprinkler,
which may be used on fire hydrants, has
several uses: as a playground or street

With this easily assembled sprinkler
and adapter, the water stream may be

directed to the front or to the rear of

the hydrant. Thomas Brothers, 127

Emotional Problems and What
You Can Do About Them

William B. Terhune. William Mor-
row & Company, Inc., 425 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 16. Pp. 190. $3.00.

The sub-title of this book, “First Aid
to Wiser Living,” might also be “First
Aid to Wiser Leadership,” for it dis-
cusses leadership qualities, practical
techniques for the handling of specific
problems and situations, ways of help-
ing othersu—children, adolescents, and
adults—through understanding of psy-
chological development or of emergen-
cies. Basic to good leadership, of course,
is an understanding of people, and of
Ourselves.

With deep insight, and knowledge of
areas of emotional disturbances, Dr.
Terhune, who is associate clinical pro-
fessor of psychiatry at the Yale School
of Medicine and has been a pioneer in
the field of personal and public mental
hygiene, has drawn upon his wide ex-
perience to give an even emphasis to
problems at all age levels.

ABC’s of Camp Music

Janet E. Tobitt, Girl Scout Equip-
ment Company, 155 East 4‘4th Street,
New York 17. Pp. 46. $.75.

This forty-six—page booklet, while dis-
tributed through the Girl Scouts, is not
written specifically for that one group.
Its suggestions are excellent for any
type of camp situation—and will also
be very helpful for day-camp and play-
ground leaders. It will help any leader
who knows the importance of music ac-
tivities but is not a trained musician.
The illustrations by Elizabeth Ross are
amusing and informal.

Miss Tobitt has given us a simple,
practical and creative approach, illus-
trating her suggestions with specific
examples. She has emphasized, also,
the point that music cannot and should
not be an isolated activity, but that it
lends itself admirably to broaden and
enrich other activities such as dancing,
drama, nature, and handcraft—and she
shows how to make this correlation.

Progression, too, is emphasized —
the importance of providing more and
better opportunities for interesting mu-

200

sic projects as the group and the leader
increase in skill and interest.

This booklet will be useful in leader-
ship training, and its remarkably low
price makes it possible for every leader
to have a copy. Highly recommended.

We have only two minor criticisms.
The artwork on the cover does not con-
form to the best elements of design, and
the bibliography could be improved.

A Playgroup Handbook for
Parents and Leaders

lovisa C. Wagoner. Olympic Col-

lege Parent Education Program, Brem-
erton, Washington. Pp. 137. $1.50.

This manual defines a playgroup, not
as a kindergarten, or a child care cen-
ter or a nursery school, but as “a care-
fully planned but informal arrangement
for preschool children to meet regular-
ly, to enjoy each other, to learn from
each other as they use the material and
equipment provided. The cooperative
playgroup is organized and adminis-
tered by the parents of the children at-
tending.”

The book grew out of practical ex-
perience. For those departments and
those leaders who are planning play-
groups for pre-school children, and who
are working to develop a cooperative
plan with parents, it will be most help-
ful in many ways.

Songs Children Like: Folk Songs
from Many Lands

Association for Childhood Educa-
tion International, 1200 Fifteenth
Street, NW, Washington 5, D. C. Pp.
48. $1.00.

A charming and unusual collection
of songs—surely children will like them.
One wonders if anybody associated with
children would want to be without such
a wealth of material, most of it unfa-
miliar to American musicians, but sing-
able and appealing. Friendly footnotes
suggest wider use of the songs—to be
accompanied by clapping hands or
skipping to the chorus. In some in-
stances directions for accompanying
play are given. A song written by an
eight year old boy and a Halloween hit
composed by a third grade are followed

by the challenge, “Why not make up a
song of your own?”

Songs from twenty nations include a
delightful lullaby from Japan, a Span-
ish hymn, an Indonesian play song with
quacking like a duck, and songs from
Hawaii, China, and Latin America.

How to Help Folks Have Fun

Helen and Larry Eisenberg. Asso-

ciation Press, 291 Broadway, New
York 7. Pp. 64. $1.00.*

A gaily covered, pocket-size booklet
on social recreation. Designed p riniarily
as an ‘fidea starter,” it should be helpful
to volunteer and amateur leaders who
are faced with planning social programs
for their groups. Also, it should be
particularly helpful to church and rural
leaders, parents, and to those who have
not been trained in recreation or had a
good deal of experience in planning so-
cial affairs, but who have to do it once
in a while. For professional recreation
leaders, it will serve as a “refresher.”
but will be found rather elementary.

Guide Lines for Group Leaders

Janet P. and Clyde E. Murray.
Whiteside Press, Inc., 425 Fourth Ave-
nue, New York 16. Pp. 224. $3.95.*

Mr. and Mrs. Murray are writing out
of a rich background of experience.
Their book is easy to read and the au-
thors have very effectively woven phil-
osophy and down to earth psychology
throughout. It should be especially help-
ful to volunteer leaders, professional
students, and to those in beginner po- '
sitions which include face to face lead- I
ership with groups. I

The book helps to dispel some of the
mystery, fears, and discouragements of
group leaders and offers common-sense
advice. The situations used as illustra-
tions are very real, as the experiences
of leaders are analyzed and discussed.
Good and bad features of leadership.
types of individuals and their problems
are shown. .

Human needs as seen by the authors
are discussed warmly and include: the
need to be loved; acceptance; recogni-
tion; belonging; feeling of adequacy:
security; new experience; and creative
expression.

Nine principles of good group work
practices are clarified and discussed ex-
tensively. It is pointed out quite e1n-
phatically that these are guides and not
rules, that they are criteria against
which a leader can test his practice. it
is believed that with experience these
principles will become a part of the
leader’s thinking. —W. C. Sutherland.
Director, Personnel Department, NRA.

“The Devil was having _

Wife trouble”

«IlEREI AM,
“’ twenty-four
years old and what
have I done?” he had“
. once written. But he
 was 53, and his face,

like his indomitable
will, had become seared and toughened by

years of Arctic struggle before he reached
his ultimate goal.

On December  .1909, Robert E. Peary,

standing where no man had set foot before,
planted the American flag on the North Pole.

His return to his base was so uneventful
one of his Eskimos said the Devil must have
been asleep or having trouble with his wife.

Actually, good luck of this sort was a rarity
to Peary. He had failed six times before to
reach the Pole, but he never gave up. He lived
all his life by his motto: I shall find a way or
make one.

 
    

Peary’s was a motto Americans find easy to
understand. In fact, it typifies the practical
“strike-out-for-yourself” spirit of the 160 mil-
lion American citizens who stand behind
United States Series E Savings Bonds. Per-
haps that’s why these Bonds are among the
finest investments in the world today. For
your personal security—and your country’s—
why not invest in them regularly!
