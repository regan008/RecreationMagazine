RECREATION

Hydrology and

Water Recreation

William (Cap’n Bill) Gould Vina], Ph.D.

0 A fish probably takes water for granted. A
dweller in a city also takes water for granted; but
cut off a city water supply by sabotage or an atomic
bomb, and there would be a panic in a matter of
hours. The rustic who believes that he can divine
water by a forked stick is better off in his thinking
as there is ground water everywhere. There is no
doubt that the public, if it knew water facts,
would vote that the science of water control and
water recreation should remain inviolate, each to
the other. The public has not been aroused to ex-
press its will water—wise.

Take the matter of reservoirs and water sheds.
Like Arabs of the night, hydraulic engineers si—
lently set aside millions of acres every year. They
take the most rugged, scenic, wild areas to be
found. Since the human animal will foul his own
water supply, he has been ruled out by legal signs
and high wire fences. Consider the Quabbin Res—
ervoir—the second largest lake in New England.
To build it required the wiping out of four towns,
the moving of nearly thirty cemeteries, and a sixty—
mile aqueduct large enough to drive a truck
through to metropolitan Boston. The only intended
recreation was waterscapes. After considerable

EDITORIAL

misgivings, however, fishermen are allowed to
stand on shore at specified spots and cast for fish.
There are other public reservoirs where boating
is allowed and water sheds where camping exists
—but not at Quabbin.

The reports on rain making read like fairy tales.
Rain makers, like artists, are interested in the tall,
billowing, wool-packed clouds. Dr. \Vallace E.
Howell, from Harvard’s Blue Hill Meteorological
Observatory, has been seeding promising clouds
with silver iodide. The Catskills have been deluged
with the heaviest rainfall in the last fifty years. In
the meantime, New England is twenty-eight'per
cent short. Whether or not New York City stole
New England rain, the result is the same. If New
York City is improvident with reservoirs, there
may be need of a law to compel it to let New
England’s rain alone. Dr. Howell may be a witch
apprentice. New York City is voting to renew his
contract for another six months. The new tech—
nology of rain making is too young to make final
conclusions. In any case, floods or drought are not
conducive to recreation or the good life.

The story of flood controls is equally dramatic.
On July 28, 1950, the dam across the Nubanusit
River in New Hampshire, part of a 2.5 million
dollar project, was dedicated to the memory of
Edward MacDowell, American composer. The
waters of Nubanusit come from lakes of many
uses. Half Moon Pond is one hundred per cent
recreation, being owned by Sargent Camp. Harris—
ville Pond furnishes power for a typical New Eng-
land textile mill. Summer cottages are already be-
ing built elbow to elbow on its shores. This may
be suggestive of a new surpassing value for the
lake. Child’s Bog has been raised to join Silver
Lake as a public water supply. Bogs and their rare
plants are becoming less and less. Nubanusit Lake
is held in trust by an exclusive summer colony.
These are four typical ways of eternally locking up
lakes from the public. It is fortunate, indeed, that
an old colonial access law set aside the idea that
commoners can go fishing. It’s a travesty that we,
the people, haven’t done much thinking in the last
200 years about public waters. It is later than we
think for casting a covetous eye on what we have
left.

Another striking fact is bound to ‘come home to
roost. Too many teachers and recreationists hardly
ever give a flood project a passing glance; too of-

. 291

ten they fail to see its possibilities for recreation.

The N ubanusit River, for instance, presents eleven
miles of spectacular scenery winding through New
Hampshire meadows of white and yellow water
lilies, and is studded by blue pickerel weed and gay
swamp milkweed. Beaver, wood ducks and fish
abound; even deer come down to water.

. \Vater wilderness, however, can still be enjoyed
by all people. That idea was perfectly clear when
Thoreau and Emerson visited Mt. Monadnock a
hundred years ago. All this public domain and the
wildlife thereon once belonged to the Indians, in-
dividually and collectively. It could again become
a wildlife refuge for the enjoyment of folks of the
l\‘lonadnock region. Rumor has it that the state
conservation department of New Hampshire con-
templates leasing the flood area from the Federal
Government for just that purpose. However, there
is not much evidence that the public cares whether
it is set aside or not. If, therefore, the ideas in-
culcated in children by New Hampshire camps——
if the ideas of canoeing, naturing and outdoor living
live on—we can imagine that someday the ears of
the present citizens will burn aplenty if they fail
to provide water enjoyment for the future.

A much closer approach to the commonweal has
been attained by conservationists who have reha-
bilitated a farm in one day. Such events have oc—
curred in most states. Each program, like a big
football game, attracts an audience of 50,000 peo-

ple. Volunteers run tractors and plows to prevent
erosion. Bulldozers scoop out ponds for fire pro-
tection and to furnish spring water for stock. Con-
servation experts advise the owners on how to use
the pond for fishing, boating and swimming. As a
result of these good neighbor demonstrations, thou-
sands of farms now have scientifically—planned
ponds which include possibilities for recreation.
And, indeed, should not everyone know a pond
from childhood?

Leaders are needed to arouse the intelligent ap-
preciation of water resources. Looking ahead can
become the American habit in the aquatic wilder-
ness as well as in the forest wilderness. Recrea-
tionists must see to, it that -our water resources for
recreation do not run out on us.

Hopeful and encouraging trends in this
whole problem are the present activities of
the Federal Government in studying the rec—
reational use of the nation’s water resources,
and the appointment of the President’s Wa-

ter Resources Policy Commission. This com—
mission has asked the Federal Inter-Agency
Committee on Recreation to act as a sub—
committee of the commission. For further
information, see Joseph Prendergast’s N ews—

0 THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION of Health, Physi-
cal Education and Recreation has recently joined
the American Institute of Park Executives, the
American Recreation Society and the National
Recreation Association on the Committee on Sur-
facing Recreation Areas. It has named two repre-
sentatives to the committee—Harry C. Thompson,
Director of Recreation, Department of Education,
Great Neck, Long Island, and John A. Johnson,
Supervisor of Health and Physical Education, De-
partment of Education, Des Moines, Iowa.

0 FOLLOWING UP the Washington conference-—
held in January by the Federal Housing and
House Finance Agency—the National Recreation
Association and the Housing Facilities Branch of
the PHA have conferred repeatedly regarding the
important problems of providing the necessary
recreation facilities and leadership services for
residents in housing projects. NRA district repre-
sentatives are prepared to help communities in
working out suitable plans of cooperation. The
approach to such plans is not from the standpoint
of the housing project but in terms of the needs of
the residents of the entire neighborhood. A study
of a substantial number of cities, in which there
now exist both recreation departments and hous-
ing authority projects, emphasizes the need for
early local cooperative planning.

0 A NOVEL METHOD of helping assure the develop—
ment of park and recreation facilities in new sub-
divisions of land has been devised by the city
authorities in Claremont, California. They have
ruled that subdividers of land within the city are
to pay a fee of twenty-five dollars per lot, the
funds to be used for park and recreation purposes.
A somewhat similar ruling was put into effect in
Whittier, California. The NRA would like to
hear of other communities that have taken steps
to assure the provision of recreation areas in new
subdivisions.

0 FORTY-SEVEN GRADUATE STUDENTS were re—
ported on the campus of Indiana University last
semester, all working for an advanced degree in
recreation.

0 THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION of the Ameri-
can Institute of Park Executives has received the
approval and endorsement of that organization for
the establishment of regional institutes throughout
the country—each affiliated with a college or uni—

versity. Various park and recreation associations
will serve as co-sponsors. The New England In-
stitute of Park and Recreation Administration was
held at Springfield College in September, Richard
S. Westgate of the NRA attending. Registrants
represented forty—five organizations from six
states.

0 ONE PROFESSIONAL AND ONE LAY MEMBER will
represent each organization participating in Presi-
dent Truman’s White House Conference on Youth
in December, 1950. Otto T. Mallery, chairman of
the board, and Joseph Prendergast, executive di-

rector, will attend for the National Recreation
Association.

0 AMONG FIRST STEPS in strengthening National
Recreation Association district services are not
only the realignment of districts and the taking
on of additional district staff, but the opening of
district offices. As a start, the Great Lakes district
office. is located in Toledo, that of the Pacific
Northwest in Seattle, the Pacific Southwest in
Los Angeles, the Middle Atlantic district in New
York City, and the New England district in
Boston.

0 FLORIDA RECREATION EXECUTIVES are planning
a meeting to discuss the recreation needs of serv-
icemen in their communities.

0 THE NATIONAL RECREATION ASSOCIATION has
been asked to be one of the sponsoring agencies of
a working conference in physical education for
elementary school children to be held in Wash-
ington, January 10-17, 1951, and to appoint an
official representative to attend. Arthur \Villiams,
of the NRA staff, will serve in that capacity. The
conference is being financed by the Athletic Insti-
tute of Chicago.

294 RECREATION

“Today there is great concern over the family . . . Undoubtedly
family life is beset with many problems and handicapped by
a variety of obstacles.”—Lawrence K. Frank in THE SURVEY.’

"WHAT MAKES IT BUUNCE?”

HAT DOES MAKE home life bounce anyway?

What is it that gives it the tang of salt air,
the pungency of balsam and pine, the sparkle of a
crisp, snowy winter morning? Is it work? This is
essential in order that we may live and count for
plus one in the scheme of things.

Is it worship? This is the fibre of it. Worship
is essential for depth and steadiness in life.

Is it love—not supine, but militant love with its
attributes of infinite patience and deep understand-
ing—love of home and homeland, love of friends,
of ,family, of one’s fellow man, of beauty in all
things? This also is absolutely essential. Without
love, color, tang, zest, great inspirations are absent
from life.

Work, worship, love are necessary, but given
these life lacks resilience; is a car without springs
unless we add that great leavener—play. Truly
play makes life bounce. The leisure of life without
play is dull and drab.

Through play or recreation, living is enriched
and we keep physically and spiritually lit. Through
play in leisure hours, we find our great opportunity

for self-expression, for growth and development,
for achieving cultural and spiritual heights. Music,
drama and pageantry, creative art, literature and
recreation, all forms of play, are absolutely essen-
tial to the enrichment of the life of the individual
and of the home.

I cannot overemphasize to you the vital impor-
tance of building a tradition of play and recreation
in your home life. That home is dead, whether it
knows it or not, which neglects to set aside leisure
hours for the attainment of the higher things of
life——for worship, for joyous family recreation, fun
in games, creative expression in art, music, dra-
matics and in handcrafts. No home can hope to
hold, nor appreciably influence, its adolescent
youth which has done nothing to enrich the minds
of its youth with such happy memories of fainin
play time.

There is such a wealth of things which can be
done for the enrichment of the family play life
that no one need be at a loss. There isn’t time to
suggest many of them. Let me name just two
which combine many interests.

One of the simplest beginnings of building the
tradition of play is the family evening “at home,”
when father and mother and the children make no

295

outside engagements and plan to spend an hour or
two together on the same night each week for read-
ing aloud, music, storytelling, story dramatization,
handcrafts and a host of other things which families
can find to do together. The responsibility for
making the thing go, of course, rests upon Father
and Mother. \Ve should be alert, however, to the
rich things which our_ children have to contribute
from their own experience in school. It is im-
portant that the planning for these evenings should
be a family affair and not just a parental one.

As a setting for the other suggestion, may I
make a plea that we set aside the evening meal for
dining——-that almost lost social art. At least one
meal a day should be eaten with leisure and spiced
with interesting conversation and social joy in each
other’s company. Here is the suggestion: one
family, in order to furnish a conversation reservoir
for this, spent a winter in learning about the in—

dustry, husbandry, art, sciences and history which
lie back of bringing the simple things of everyday
use to the home—the silver, linen, furniture, china,
glassware and rugs. At the evening meal, this
became the fascinating t0pic of much of the con-
versation.

Just these two things——-the at-home evening and
dining one meal a day—will add much to the zest
and joy of home life.

One last word—I want to make the most earnest
plea to you that I possibly can to turn inward to
the home your clearest thinking, vision and im-
agination and your deepest devotion to the end
that its life may richer, fuller be.

Our homes are the weIISprings of our com-
munity and national life. If they are not crystal
clear and pure and sparkling, how then can we
ever hope to achieve a deep, clean, powerful and
steady-Howing stream of national life?

 

A Home Recreation Contest

URING THE SPRINGS of 1949 and 1950, a home

recreation contest was conducted in Alameda
and Contra Costa counties in California, as a joint
project of the recreation departments of the cities
and towns in these counties, of the sixteenth and
twenty-eighth districts of the California Congress
of PTA’s and of the Oakland Tribune, the local
newspaper.

Acting upon a suggestion from Oakland’s super-
intendent of recreation, Robert W. Crawford-—
who also is serving as state recreation chairman
for the PTA Congress—the recreation chairmen
of the sixteenth and twenty-eighth district clubs
developed a program contest to encourage the crea-
tion, development and improvement of recreation
facilities in and around the home for all age
groups, in the belief that homes which have rec-
reation as a regular part of their lives are happier
homes.

It was found to be advantageous for the PTA
districts to handle their own contests since they
had the opportunity of getting closer to the neigh-
borhood groups., The contest was divided into
three divisions—for an indoor play area, an out-
door play and recreation area, and an outdoor
living area. The last was judged on its attrac-
tive landscaping and planning for the comfort of
family and friends. The contest was open to all
residents but was restricted to one entry from

296

each family.

March first was set as the initial day for entries,
and April first as the closing date. Judging took
place during the last of May (there were approxi-
mately seventy-five finalists) and winners were
announced the first week in June. Projects were ,
judged only upon the amount of work done since
June of last year. Winners were awarded hand-
some plaques—one for each classification—and
duplicate awards were given as there was no com-
petition between districts. .

It was stressed throughout the contest that any
home improvements should be of the sort an aver-
age person could carry out without too much
expense, and which could be accomplished in a
few well-spent week-ends in the backyard or base-
ment.

A twenty-five page small booklet of suggestions
and actual specifications was printed by the news-
paper for free distribution. Valuable tips on in-
creasing indoor recreation by utilizing a basement
or spare room and for adding a sandbox, play-
house, pond or pool, backyard apparatus, game
courts in the driveway and game standards to the
outdoor play area were included. A copy of this
contest booklet may be secured by writing to Mrs.
Helen Iverson, General Supervisor, Oakland Rec-
reation Department, 21-12th Street, Oakland 7,
California.

R. KE’ENAN, the plumber, came from the
kitchen where he had been making repairs,
and stopped by the dining-room door. The table
was decorated with colored crepe—paper runners.
Dainty paper cups, filled with tiny gumdrOps, were
at each plate, along with odd-shaped place cards.
“Having a party?” he asked.
“Just for the family,” I told him, smiling.
“A birthday?”
“Yes—the birthday of our state.”
And, because he looked interested and because
I knew he had small children of his own, I told him
of the plan I had devised and was carrying out.
“My youngsters, like all children, love parties,”
I began. “But they always used to be fretful and
tired after one, and I had trouble calming them
down. Then I conceived the idea of having quiet
little parties for them here at honme—for extra
occasions—which would please, but not excite

them.”
“Say, I wish you’d tell me more about it l” Mr.

Keenan exclaimed. “I’ve heard my wife say she
dreaded parties because the children were so un-

manageable afterwards.”
“I find now, that when an outside party does

come, my boys take it much more quietly,” I said.
“They’re—well, you might say, conditioned.

“I had to hunt for occasions other than the well-
known ones in order to give them a party once a
month. Valentine’s Day and April Fool’s Day,
also \Nashington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays were
easy. I looked up other anniversariesr—Flag Day,
Arbor Day, Columbus Day, and birthdays of per-
sons of note who are not nationally honored.

“This month, as you see, we’re celebrating the
day our state was admitted into the Union. Every
state has a motto and a flower—which helps.”

Mr. Keenan looked at the place cards. “Maps of

the state,” he remarked.
“Yes, my older son made these from drawing

paper, and my kindergarten boy colored them and
cut them out. They needed very little assistance

from me.”

“Say, that’s pretty good 1” Mr. Keenan said
admiringly.

“The cards aren’t very even, but that’s not im-
portant. The children are so proud of their work,
that they can hardly wait until their father comes
home so that they can show it to him. .I think
it’s good for the boys to find that things they have
learned at school can be put to practical use.”

Mr. Keenan nodded approvingly. “You’re right

about that.”
“There’s another benefit from these parties,” I

added. “The children are the guests. \Ve en-
courage them to talk, but in turn; that is, they
learn not to interrupt but to listen carefully to
what the other person is saying. This evening,
their father and I will tell them some simple, in-
teresting facts about their home state, and we shall
be prepared to answer any questions which they
may ask.”

“Isn’t that a rather large order?” grinned Mr.

Keenan. “I’d have to study up.”
“Oh, believe me, we do, too,” I laughed. “Later

we may sing our state song and read a poem or
story connected with some incident in the state’s

history or about a famous native son.”
“Y on know,” said Mr. Keenan heartily, “I’m all

for this! It seems a grand way to get the young-
sters to stay at home. I’m going to pass the idea
on to my wife. Thanks a lot for explaining it to

me; it’s going to be of great help.”

A LITTLE BIT OF HAPPINESS -

Q- NYONE who has been confined to a hospital
or to a bed at home is well-aware of the

drudgery of such long, idle hours. Seemingly
wasted hours spent in bed drag tediously; seconds
seem like minutes, minutes like hours.
It’s hard enough for adults to stay in bed day
after day, but it’s even greater misery for children,
- who must shackle their youthful enthusiasms.
Confronted with an idleness problem on a year-
round basis, officials of the Sister Elizabeth Kenny
Institute in Minneapolis have instigated a program
that they believe is successfully alleviating the
problem.
Realizing that idle hours give their polio pa-
- tients time to worry about their illnesses, Kenny
personnel handle the program on the theory that
occupied hours are swiftly passing, happy hours.
Kenny personnel thus offers patients many oppor-
tunities to occupy their leisure time by partici-
pating in various types of recreational pastimes.
This recreation program might well be con-
sidered an important phase of the over—all treat-
ment at the institute. Many of the patients, who
are mainly children, are hospitalized for as long as
a year and some for even two years. In the case
of younger patients, it means being confined dur—
ing what is usually the most active part of their
lives. The older patients, on the other hand, are
usually attacked by the disease at a time when they

have determined their life’s work. Thus, many feel
that this malady will alter longtplanned ambitions.

At any rate, all patients could easily harbor a
continual, silent fear of their useless arms or legs
if it were not for the recreation periods.

Undoubtedly, the biggest event in the recreation
lives of the patients is the monthly party that is
planned and presented either by the patients or the
recreation director, Helen Downs. Parties are
given on Valentine’s Day, the Fourth of July, at
Halloween and at Christmas. The patients also
celebrate birthdays at smaller parties, go to the
Shriner’s circus every year, and have special event
parties. An example of the last was the Hollywood
party where patients designed their own costumes
and produced skits impersonating motion picture
stars. (See “Hollywood Night,” December 1948
RECREATION.)

Outside entertainment is occasionally brought in,
but it has been found that the patients usually get
restless if too many parties are conducted without
their help. Thus, most of the affairs are conducted
with patient participation, with community singing
one of the more popular events. Miss Downs thinks
that the patients would stay up all night singing
songs if they were permitted to do 50.

She has found that planning a party theme that
will satisfy all patients is a difficult job indeed
because of the wide range in ages and in tastes.
However, the friendly family feeling at the insti-
tute has assured the success of all affairs. The
patients seem to enjoy getting together (there are
separate wards for boys, girls, men and women)

NOVEMBER 1950

for many find that this companionship replaces the
loneliness of home life where there are no brothers
or sisters.

To understand how a party is planned and pre-
sented, let’s take a look at one of the past parties
and see how it operated.

Arrangements were made so that Ralph Ed-
wards, master of ceremonies of the “Truth or Con-
sequences” radio program, would stop at the
institute while on a personal appearance tour in
Minneapolis. A few of the “trusted” polio patients
were told of the visit, but were cautioned to keep it
a secret. Within a few hours, everyone in the
building knew of the party although no one would
admit he knew. '

This type of “secret” party created great in-
terest in the coming event. The party was to be
conducted just as the radio program is held, only
the patients would take over, even down to the
commercials advertising “Mud,” that new washing
sensation. Ralph Edwards would be on the pro-
gram but as a contestant.

The excitement reached its peak on the night
before the show. Practically all the older patients,
who wore loin cloths during the day to facilitate
treatment, prepared—as they usually did for all
parties—to wear street clothes. Each patient was
made to feel that he was a vital part of the party.

Although everything seemed to go wrong at the
final rehearsal, the party night was a big success
and reached its climax when Ralph Edwards was

, squirted with seltzer water for missing a question.

All parties are held in the boys’ ward, which is

the largest. \Vhenever there’s a party, all the beds
are pushed to one ,side of the room. Patients who
can’t sit up are brought in first for preferred posi-
tions. Patients in wheel chairs move in next, fol-
lowed by those who are relearning to walk.

Nurses and ward aids keep a close watch on all
patients and remove 'any who seem to be getting
fatigued.

Whatever the party, whether it’s a May Day or
Halloween party, it remains in the minds and
conversations of the patients for days before and
after each event.

Friday night is officially designated as movie
night. Serials, cartoons and recent popular hits
are shown. Every once and a while, the patients
are blessed with a “rip-snortin” Wild West thril-
ler. Some of the younger patients carry their cap
pistols to the show and live every minute of the
hero’s life. Most of the girls seem to like these
westerns and are just as boisterous as the boys
when “there’s danger a-brewin’, pardner.”

Actually, Friday isn’t the only night for movies
since eight television sets, donated by different
organizations, supply movies every night. The
younger patients, who haven’t seen much tele-
vision, watch the screen for hours, entranced at any-
thing that comes over the airways. Older patients
are a bit choosy about what they watch.

Generally speaking, the patients have few nights
planned for -them, recreationally. Miss Downs
wants to get away from any feeling that a patient
cannot plan his own recreation and, therefore, each
chooses his own pastime on most occasions.

300

He decides what he wants to do
on a particular evening and one of
the Kenny personnel, or a volunteer
worker, does his best to fulfill that
wish if it is reasonable. However,
not all requests can be granted. For
example, a red-headed young man
recently called Miss Downs over to
his bed and very seriously asked if
he could have two fencing swords.‘

“My pal and I could fence each
other from our beds without getting
up,” he said. He was persuaded to
try another means of entertainment.

Patients pass the time by paint-
ing, weaving, making bracelets, knit-
ting, coloring, cutting, playing games
or popping corn.

Older men find leather-making
both enjoyable and profitable. Hav—
ing had lessons from an expert
brought in by the institute, these
men and some younger boys make and sell belts
and sandals. Some of the men intend to continue
this work when they have been discharged.

Most of the older women prefer painting. One
woman likes to specialize in peasant paintings;
while another has learned the art of coloring photo-
graphs. ’

Tuesday night is music night for children under
six who have formed a rhythm band composed of
sticks, triangles, rattles and tambourines. Using
a piano as accompaniment, they play songs and
sing for an hour. They’re really proud of their
organization.

On the whole, the morale of the institute leaves
little to be desired. During the patients’ waking
hours, the institute is constantly ringing with
laughter and the happy voices of patients who are
victims of one of man’s worst enemies—poliomye-
litis. If a patient chooses to be gloomy, he is soon
kidded out of it by the rest of the group.

When a patient gains in his fight against the
common foe, there is no jealousy, but a sincere
happiness for the improved patient. Tears come
to the eyes of many a departing patient who has
won his battle—but is still sorry to leave.

Just how much the recreation benefits affect the
general feelings and attitudes of the patients can—
not be determined, but recreation has found a
permanent home in the Kenny Institute.

American citizen. Having fun is the crowning
ritual of national life in America.”—C. A. Lejezme.

 ' l  ' ' ' 'I a school centers by recreation departments, are revealed
in aestudy made early in 1950 by the National Recrea-
tion Association. The study, limited to the recreational
use of facilities in school buildings by municipal recrea-
tion departments and community recreation organiza-
tions, affords evidence of an increasing readiness on the
part of school authorities to make their buildings avail-
able for use as community recreation centers. It was de-
signed to reveal the nature and extent of such use, the
limitations, if any, imposed by school authorities, the
methods of financing, and the administrative arrange-
ments for cooperation between school and recreation de-

partments.

inquiry was addressed. The communities from which a
response was received are located in thirty-two states,
and include localities with a wide range of population.

NOVEMBER 1950 301

The conditions and 'opinions reported in this
selective study cannot be considered as represent-
ative of the country as a whole, but they do afford
a true picture of the recreational use of indoor
school facilities in cities where year-round recrea-
tion departments conduct community prOgrams in
school buildings. Much of the information sub-
mitted by the recreation executives is tabulated
and recorded in the pages which follow.

Summary of Findings

The situation, as regards the use of school build-
ings by recreation departments in the 105 commu-
nities covered by the study, may be summarized as
follows:

School authorities make available to the recrea—
tion department all types of indoor facilities which
are suitable for use in the conduct of recreation
programs. Gymnasiums, auditoriums and attendant
service rooms are used more frequently for recrea—
tion and in more cities than other
school facilities.

Many types of school facilities, now
used in a few cities, would be made
available to more recreation depart-
ments if these departments had the
personnel with which to conduct a
program in them.

\Veekday evenings and weekdays
after school are the most popular
times of use for recreation, with some-
what less use on school vacation days and Satur:
day mornings, and little use during school hours.

There is a widespread disposition on the part of
boards of education to make their publicly—owned
facilities available for community use with as few
limitations as possible. Few boards impose un-
reasonable restrictions which interfere with the
effectiveness of the recreation program; the “no
smoking” rule is the only such restriction fre-
quently reported.

More than one-half of the school authorities
share in the cost of the recreation program; ap—
proximately one-fourth contribute funds to the rec-
reation department or carry a recreation item in
their budget. One—fourth of the recreation depart-
ments are not required to make any payment for
the use of school buildings ; the others merely meet
the cost of custodial service, pay a rental fee for
the facilities used or carry other use charges.

The recreational use of school buildings is some-
times reciprocated by school use of municipal rec—
reation properties. '

used for recreation are few and reasonable; they

,usually call for less personnel than the recreation

department would, in any case, require for its
program.

Membership of a school board member on the
recreation board is the most common administra-
tive device for facilitating cooperation between
school and recreation authorities; nearly half of
the cities report it.

Periodic joint meetings of school and recreation
boards or staff members, assignment of school per—
sonnel to the recreation“ staff, and joint employ—
ment of administrative personnel by school and
recreation agencies are other effective cooperative
arrangements.

In the opinion of recreation executives, a mutual
desire to cooperate, an understanding of common
objectives, and an effort to cultivate good personal
relationships are the factors which contribute most
to cooperation.

The necessity of using, for recrea-
tion, school buildings not designed for
such use presents, by far, the most
common obstacle to cooperation in the
'conduct of school centers. Joint action
in planning new schools for commu-
nity use is considered an effective pros

School Facilities Used and Times of Use

The kinds of indoor school facilities
used by the recreation authorities and the times
when these facilities are used for recreation were
the first subjects of inquiry. A tabulation of the
responses from the 105 communities is given in
Table I.

The gymnasium, with 102 communities report-
ing its use at least part of the°time, is unquestion-
ably the most frequently used major facility, and
the aggregate of 383 uses is the highest reported.
Auditoriums, with 308 uses, are the next most
widely used major indoor space. The large num—
ber of uses of shower and locker rooms is presum-
ably an accompaniment to gymnasium activities.
Playrooms, classrooms and community rooms
serve for a variety of activities in many cities.
Cafeterias, cooking and sewing labs, music and art
rooms receive relatively little community recrea—

- tion use. The fact that thirty-three cities report

the use of hallways for recreation perhaps reflects
the lack of indoor spaces suitable for this purpose.
The smallest numbers of reported uses are among
those facilities found in few schools, namely rifle
ranges, photography rooms and the like. Summer
use of toilet rooms in connection with adjoining

RECREATION

playgrounds may account, in part, for the high ag-
gregate total uses for these facilities.

It should be pointed out that the figures in
Table I do not give a complete picture of the school
facilities that are suitable and available for recrea-
tion in the cities reporting, nor do they represent
all the facilities which the school authorities are
willing to make available for community recreation
use. They record primarily the facilities which the
recreation departments have asked the school
boards to turn over to them for their program.
Ten recreation executives volunteered the infor-
mation that any suitable rooms in the schools of
their city would be made available to them upon
request; several others who reported the use of
only a few facilities stated that they had never
asked the school board for permission to use
others. A few reported that several types of school
facilities in their city were being used for an adult
education program. It is clear that recreation de-
partment funds, personnel and programs, rather
than rulings of the school authorities, determine
the nature and extent of the use of school buildings
in mariy cities.

The most popular times for using school facili-
ties, as indicated by Table I, are weekday eve-

nings, with after-school hours in second place, fol-
lowed by vacation days and Saturday mornings.
It should be remembered that school properties are
made available to outside organizations only when
such use does not interfere with the school pro-
gram. The limited use of facilities during school
hours probably reflects the present need for all
available indoor school space as well as the absence
in most older school buildings of such facilities as
conference rooms and community rooms, which
might not be used full time for school purposes.

The times of greatest use reported for each fa-
cility are indicated by the horizontal lines of the
table. Auditoriums, for example, are most often
used on weekday evenings and, to a lesser degree.
after school hours on weekday afternoons, Satur-
day mornings and during school vacations. The
same is true of gymnasiums, toilets, shower and
locker rooms—as might be expected. Community
rooms, libraries, cafeterias, conference rooms, class-
rooms and other smaller facilities show greatest
frequency of use on schoolday afternoons and eve-
nings and somewhat less on nonschool days. Swim-
ming pools and office space apparently have greater
frequency of use on nonschool days.

quency of use of each facility in each time period.
During school hours, when facilities are not gen—
erally available for recreation, toilet rooms and
bulk storage space show most frequent use. On
weekdays after school, the auditoriums, gymnasi-
ums, playrooms and related facilities are most fre-
quently reported. 011 weekday evenings, the same
facilities are most popular, and ordinary class-
rooms receive considerable use. Many Special
rooms such as shops, labs, music and art rooms
and rifle ranges are more widely used on weekday
evenings than at any other time, but more swim—
ming pools are open on vacation days.

Board of Education Restrictions
on the Use of Buildings

The restrictions on the checklist submitted to
recreation executives, together with the aggregate
number of responses for each, are given in Table
II. In checking the items, executives were asked
to limit their responses to those “which interfere
with the effectiveness of your program.” The re-
sponses thus are presumed to reflect sore spots in
the relations of recreation and school authorities
except for the one—third of the sampling that re-
ported no hampering restrictions.

 

 

Inability to secure regular use of buildings as
scheduled was listed by eighteen recreation exec'u—
tives as interfering with effective conduct of their
programs; and one reported inadequate heat as a
restricting factor.

The type of restriction that seems to interfere
most with the use of schools for recreation is the
prohibition of smoking. Twenty—two of the forty-
six communities reporting this restriction are in
states that prohibit smoking in all public buildings.
It is perhaps significant that fifty-nine, or more
than half the communities reporting, do not report

a prohibition of smoking as interfering with their
programs. Thus, it appears that in a substantial
number of communities, “no smoking” regulations
either do not exist or, if they do, do not prove
a burdensome restriction.

The relatively small number of instances in which
the other types of restrictions hamper the program
is important. It reveals a widespread disposition
on the part of boards of education to make their
publicly-owned facilities available for community
use with as few limitations as possible. Four—fifths
or more of the boards of education in the commu-
nities studied, in allowing use of their buildings,
place no serious obstaclestapart from smoking re-
strictions, in the way of recreation departments.

None of the restrictions reported appears to
offer insurmountable obstacles. Difficulties, such
as the “inability to secure regular use of school
buildings as scheduled,” are clearly the result of
either insufficient facilities or the lack of proper
agreement between school and recreation authori-
ties.

On certain of the items, recreation authorities
were asked to specify the precise situation that
caused difficulty. Relatively few did this but the
specifications in those instances are of interest.

   

      
     
   
   
   
   
   
 
      
 

  
 

As to types of school equipment the use of which
is prohibited to recreation leaders, two mentioned
gymnasium equipment; one, the public address
system; one, the pianos; and one, the sewing ma—
chines and stoves in the home economics labora—
tories. As to the school—imposed closing hours
that are considered “too early,” two reported nine
p. m.; one, ten p. m.; and one, ten-thirty p. 111. Of

~ the nineteen respondents checking “requirement of

the employment of certain school personnel,”
eleven specified custodial workers; two specified
{I ’3 fl ' ,1
teacher ; and one, a superv1sor .

RECREATION

The only activity mentioned as prohibited 111
school buildings was square dancing in two com-
munities. On the matter of what constitutes an
“unusually high rental fee for building use,” there
is some difference of Opinion, as revealed by the
following responses to this item:

$10 for custodian for gymnasium (Calif)

$15 for rehearsals, $20 for presentations in
auditorium (Ga.)

$Ioo per night for high school gymnasium
(Iowa)

$2 5 per night plus janitor' for gymnasium
(M iss.)

$ 4 per hour for gymnasium (Ore)
$15 per gymnasium (Texas)

The refusal of available school facilities at times
when needed for recreation use was reported eight
times, Saturdays being mentioned in the only two
instances specified. The recreation executives- re-
porting “restrictions on the charging of admission
for program events” at school facilities noted that
a larger rental fee applied for auditoriums or gym-
nasiums when admissions are charged. This fee,
in most cases, is the same as any other community
group using the facility and charging an admission
fee is required to pay for its use. In other words,
recreation departments generally lose their favored
status when they charge admission for programs
in school buildings.

WM’I‘HANKSGIVING

FTER THAT big Thanksgiving dinner, after--
A wards at the community center, or during the
Thanksgiving party, the following games will be
loads of fun. Easily adapted to the turkey season,
they are contributed by National Recreation Asso-
ciation leadership training Specialists — Helen
Dauncey, Anne Livingston and Mildred Scanlon.

Around the Dinner Table

Turkey——Pencil and paper are provided for
each guest. If dice aren’t available, mark two cubes
of sugar as a substitute. Each player has a turn
at rolling the cubes, his object being to get a pair
of sixes so that he may start his picture of a turkey.

\Vhen he succeeds, he then tries his luck or skill°

at throwing for the following numbers to help him
complete his drawing:

2 SixeS=body 7 tail feathers
number 2=leg 8 (Each turkey
3=toe 9 =must have at
4=neck 10 least five
5=red piece of head II tail feathers)
6—eye S

 

The player who first iinishes his picture of Mr.
Turkey is hailed as the winner.

Toothpiek Pictures—Although this is particu—
larly exciting to four and five-year—olds, it is sur-
prising how many other age groups will be in-
trigued. Youngsters are given a box of toothpicks
with which to make pictures on the table. For
variation, a little mound of confetti is given to each

child plus a dab of paste and a sheet of paper. He ’

can then make pictures which will be as gay and
colorful as his imagination.

306

 

Fortune Spin—The leader Spins a milk bottle
on the table in the center of the circle formed by
the guests. While the bottle is spinning, he asks
a question aloud. The person to whom the bottle
points when it stOps is the answer to the question.
Some of the things to be asked might include :

Who will: win the Mr. America contest; lose
her upper plate; gain forty pounds; become exec-
utive of his office; and so forth.

Pig—Playing cards—or pieces of colored con-
struction paper or numbered squares of plain white
paper—can be used for this game. The cards are
dealt to the players. In the middle of the table are
spoons, clotheSpinS or any other selected article—
but one less in number than the group of players.
When the leader says “Now!” each player passes
one card, face down, to the person on his right.
Each is trying to get four cards of a kind, so con-
tinues passing only those which he does not want.
When he does get his four-of-a-kind, he quietly
places them, face down, on the table and, as incon—
Spicuously as possible, reaches out and picks up
one Spoon. Of course, the minute anyone notices
this, he follows suit. Soon everyone is grabbing
for a Spoon and, since there’s one short, someone iS
left without one, thereby earning a P—the first let-
ter in PIG. Each failure means the addition of an-
other letter, and the person who becomes PIG first
is the loser.

Card Trick by Mr. Wizard—Sometimes it’s
almost as much fun being a Spectator as a partici—
pant—-especially when there’s magic ahead! For
this trick, all cards retain their face value with the

RECREATION

exception of the Jack, Queen and King. They are
given new values—I I, 12 and 13, respectively.
(Numbered cards one through thirteen, four sets
each having a different color may also be used
here.) Mr. Wizard, beginning with the first card
he turns face upward, builds the entire deck with
stacks of 13. If he turns up 8, the next card—no
matter what it is——-will be counted as 9, the next
10, then II, 12, I3. Starting with the next card,
he begins another stack of 13, all cards facing up-
ward. After all the cards have been dealt off to
make complete stacks of I3 (don’t worry if you
haven’t used the complete deck), he asks someone
to select three stacks and turn them face down-
ward. Mr. Wizard then picks up all the remain—
ing stacks and places them with the ones left over
—if there are any. Next, he asks someone to turn
up the top card of two of the stacks and announces
that he will now name the top card of the third
stack.

Solution: Mr. Wizard has totalled the sum of
the two cards turned face downward and added 10
to the total. He deals off the number of cards and
then counts the number remaining. If five cards
are left, the top card will be the 5; if I, it will be
the ace; if 12 cards remain, it will be the queen.

Away from the Table

Balance———This is quite a stunt after a full—
course Thanksgiving feast! Two people hold a
yardstick about shoulder high. The rest of the
players form a-line and pass under the stick with-
out touching it, and without permitting their knees
or hands to touch the floor. Each time the column
passes through, the stick is lowered—until, finally,
it is so low that the remaining players will also be
disqualified.

IIuckle Buckle Bean Stalk—All players leave
the room or close their eyes while one person hides
an object—-—-thimble, penny, button—-—-in plain sight,
but not easy to see. It must be visible without
having to move any other objects. The players
return or open their eyes and start looking for it.
When a player discovers the object, he takes his
seat and says “Huckle Buckle Bean Stalk.” Play-
ers must not touch it or look at it after they are
seated. The game continues until everyone has
found it or until the leader declares the game is
over. The first discoverer may be the one to do the
hiding for the next round.

Form a Circle—Guests wander about the room
until they hear the sudden call “Make circles of
. . . three!” Guests who are not part of a circle of
three within one second are eliminated from the

NOVEMBER 1950

game. The leader allows a few seconds for socia-
bility within the circles, then calls “Break up !”
Each player is on his own again until the next call,
“Make circles of . . . five!” Or six, or seven, or
any number. To bring the game to a climax for
the last round, ask players to form circles of eleven.
They never make it!

\Vliere’s My Partner?—T he group is divided
into two circles, one of which is slightly larger than
the other. The smaller circle goes inside the larger
one and members of the outer circle turn their
backs on those forming the inner circle. The play-
ers in each circle link arms. To the accompani-
ment of piano or phonograph music, the two circles
move in opposite directions, singing some well-
known song. At a signal, all arms are quickly
unlinked and the players in the two circles face
each other and find partners by placing both hands
on the shoulders of someone in the opposite circle.
But, because the two groups are uneven in size,
there are not enough shoulders to go around.
Players left without a partner are eliminated from
the game. The remaining participants again form
inner and outer circles, link arms and move in op-
posite directions, singing another popular song.
At a signal, they spin around and pursue their
partners as before.

 

Woodpile—An empty pop bottle is placed on
the floor. Players sit around in a circle and each
is given a certain number of kitchen matches——
fifteen is usually a good number with which to
start. The object of the game is to see who can
get rid of his matches first. The first player puts
one match across the opening of the bottle; the
second adds one of his; the third, one of his, and
so on. If a player knocks any matches off in
putting his on, the number displaced must be added
to his original number. If any are knocked down
inside the bottle, the number displaced must be
taken from an extra supply and added to the
original number. As many as 200 matches can be
built atop of one bottle. Caution: If planning this
game for children, be sure to use only burned
matches to avoid danger of fire.

THE

HUSKING
BEE

T WAS EIGHT P. M. and nearly 1,000 peOple, all ages, were milling around
I in the gaily-decorated Fairdale Playtorium. Outside it was dark and
raining, but a festival spirit prevailed inside.

The stage was set. In the center of the room flfty bushels of corn had
been dumped. On the bandstand a hillbilly sextet was holding forth with
stringy gusto. Tots sat on their fathers’ shoulders, eagerly waiting for the
festivities to begin. Then the master of ceremonies stepped up to the
microphone and the music stopped. Booming out of a loudspeaker came the

r words: “The Third Jefferson County Huskin’ Bee is about to get under
way!”

Overalled men and plaid-shirted girls pressed forward to give their names
to Oakley Brown, assistant director of county recreation. Twenty~one of
them took their places around the pile of corn and then dropped to their
knees. A signal was given and the husks began to fly.

For live feverish minutes the contestants ripped the yellowish brown husks
from the corn. They tossed the ears behind them, and volunteer helpers
tried to keep them in neat piles—although that was often diflicult. As the big
stack dwindled, frantic contenders dived into the center to draw more raw
material near them. Then the flve minutes were gone. Cornhuskers
istraightened up, arched their backs, and looked to see how great their output
had been. The judges began to count the ears. '

Again the master of ceremonies stepped up. “The winnah, W. M. Helton,
of Valley Station. One hundred and thirty-seven ears l” More than twenty—
seven ears a minute or an ear about every three seconds. Some huskin’!

There was more, too, to the festival cooked up by the recreation board.
Guys and gals swung their partners in old—fashioned square dancing, and
awards were given for the “best-dressed.”

From Glasgow, 115 miles away, came a hillbilly band leader who played
banjo and guitar and danced a special jig, much to the amusement of the

7 many youngsters. In addition, the entertainment included a country-cousin

dance and the singing of a group of close-harmony boys. Many cornstalks,

two buggies, red wagon wheels, and blue, black and orange streamers set
a colorful scene.

A County Quilt and Rug Fair

AN EVENT which attracted a good deal of atten-
tion last year was the Quilt and Rug Fair
held in the town of Midland, Ontario, early in
August. The suggestion to have such a fair was
made by William Cranston, editor of the Midland
Free Press Herald, at a general meeting of the
Simcoe County Arts and Crafts Association. He
thought it was important that emphasis be put on
the preservation of the crafts indigenous to Simcoe
County, and saw in the promotion of a Quilt and
Rug Fair an opportunity to do this and also to
attract tourists to the town of Midland. His sug-
gestion met with great enthusiasm. A committee
was set up to make and carry out plans, and soon
things began to roll. "

Throughout the year, from October to the fol-
lowing August, the people on the committee
worked harmoniously together. There were many
problems to solve and details to work out, but they
enjoyed it. There was the excitement of the un-
known about the venture, and all sorts of interest-
ing things happened as the project progressed.

First of all, Thor Hansen, Danish-Canadian
artist, who had been the guest speaker at the meet-
ing at which Mr. Cranston had made his sug-
gestion, offered to develop quilt and rug designs
depicting historical events related to the Huronia.

district and flora and fauna native to the county.
Almost before the committee had gotten itself into
gear, some of Mr. Hansen’s designs arrived. Ex-
citement mounted as we looked these over. There
were quilt designs using the trillium, lady’s slipper,
Canada goose, an old grist mill, swamp cabbage,
trumpeter swan and oxen and yoke. There was
one called “Georgian Bay Crazy Quilt” and
another called “Huronia Trails.” The latter
showed a conventionalized design using a cloud
and a canoe on one block and, on the alternate
blocks, the traditional five canoe trails said to have
entered Huronia during the days of Brebeuf and
Lalemande. One striking over-all design illustrated
the legend about the Indian who threw the 30,000
islands into Georgian Bay. There were rug designs,
top, called “The Oxen and Yoke,” “The Lumber-
jack,” and so forth.

In order that people throughout the county
might see these designs, members of the committee
spent many a Saturday afternoon tracing and
coloring them so that there might be duplicate sets
to display. and later to .distribute. Then they
traveled many miles throughout the county, show—
ing them to women’s institutes, agricultural and
church groups who had asked to‘see them:

One winter afternoon, two members made a tour
of- about ‘one 'hundred miles, during .which they‘
visited three groups in the western'part .of‘ the-
county. One-of these groups arranged for the

309

designs to be displayed in a feed store in their tiny
village. Evidently half of the feed store was being
used as a church and half was for its usual
business. We considered ourselves particularly
honored when we found that we were to be on the
church side. All the women in that community
were out to hear about the fair and to view the
designs. Even the older schoolgirls were on hand
for they had been allowed to leave school early
especially for this event.

As the year of planning progressed, activity be-
came more and more intense. Va'rious county
newspapers cooperated by supplying space for
articles about the fair. One contributed posters;
another printed entry forms without charge. The
local radio station at Orillia carried a special inter-
view with a member of the committee.

The Canadian Handicrafts Guild loaned us, for
display, a white heirloom quilt and a number of
unusual photographs which illustrated the art of
quilt-making.

Local members collected quilts from each area
of the county, built frames on which to mount them
for diSplay, had a large wooden sign painted to
place outside the hall, and arranged for insurance
on the quilts and rugs.

The week of the fair was the hottest one of the
summer. For three evenings, members of the com—
mittee staggered about with quilts and rugs, sorted.
catalogued and hung them—about two hundred
odd—in the attractive hall of the United Church in
Midland. Articles which were for sale were hung
on the mezzanine floor, which could be seen from
below; while on the ground floor were placed the
quilts and rugs which were for display only. Owing
to some late entries, all the quilts and rugs were
still not up by Thursday morning, July 28, when
the fair was scheduled to begin. However,
promptly at ten am. the doors were opened and,
to the committee’s surprise, there was an imme-
diate inHux of people. The committee didn’t catch
its breath until noon when there was a temporary
lull, and realized then that part of the crowd had
been made up of three busloads sponsored by
women’s institute groups from various parts of the
county and by passengers of a boat which had
docked at Midland for a few hours. Already two
quilts had been sold, and everyone who came
seemed delighted with the fair.

And well they might be!‘”‘For it was a beautiful
sight. Three quilts, using Mr. Hansen’s designs,
were hung side by side at one end of the room.
They were “The Old Grist Mill,” “Canada Goose”
and “The Trillium.” On the dais below them, Thor
Hansen’s designs were on display and made an

310

impressive showing. Around the room, in cubicles,
over railings and on walls, were hung the most
colorful and interesting array of quilts and rugs
ever to be gathered in one place—in our county,
at least. There were quilts using traditional de-
signs such as the “Double Wedding Ring,” “Rob
Peter to Pay Paul,” “The Dresden China Plate”
and many others. There was one pure white quilt
with quilting just one-quarter of an inch apart,
which was over one hundred years old. Its tiny
stitches traced the design of the thistle, shamrock,
rose and maple leaf. There was a huge braided
rug in gay fiesta colors, which would grace any
floor; hooked rugs with an Oriental Havor (but
made in Simcoe County); and two using Thor
Hansen’s designs, “The Lumberjack” and “Fort
Ste. Marie.”

The Quilt and Rug Fair was. really a success.
Over 1,700 people came to see it and some came
long distances just for this event. We were pleased
about that, but even more gratified that groups
chartered busses and came from the small villages
and crossroads of our own county.

A feeling of good fellowship and congeniality
permeated these three days. Of course, this was
partly because of the committee whose members
worked untiringly and with great good humor.
Two housewives literally moved to Midland to be
on hand throughout the fair, and one business girl
tobk her vacation that week so that she could be
there all the time, too. Many others took turns
“hostessing” and door-tending. Such wholehearted
cooperation made for good organization and a
smooth running fair. Then, too, the people who
came were so interested and appreciative of one
another’s work. Perhaps the fact that no prizes
were awarded contributed to this. No quilt or rug
was arbitrarily judged better than another, except
by private opinions perhaps, and each article was
examined and enjoyed according to its beauty and
good workmanship.

Because the fair was such a success, another one
was planned for this year. The dates were August
3, 4 and 5 and the place again was the United
Church Hall in Midland. Added attractions were
quilts and rugs using designs developed by our
own county artists; a county quilt made up of
blocks in the shape of each township and upon
which groups appliqued motifs illustrating his-
torical events in their townships, and was quilted
at the fair; and a variety of arts and crafts made
by people throughout the county. A number of
outstanding quilts were entered from the province
at large, and the same quota of traditional and
modern quilts from the people of Simcoe County.

RECREATION

The Relationship of Group lVork, Recreation and Mental Health

DURING SOME FIFTEEN years in the field of
group work, both as a volunteer and profes—
sionally, I found myself becoming more and more
interested in those children and adults who, for
one reason or another, did not seem to {it into the
group, who presented “problems”. These were
generally problems which did not seem to resolve
themselves through the ordinary devices which are
the tools of any group or recreation worker. There-
fore, I iinally shifted into the field of individual
therapy, and have since spent my professional time
as a counsellor in a mental hygiene clinic. I had
come to feel that whatever usefulness I might have
would be better expressed in this kind of individ-
ual, face-to-face setting.

An interesting thing began to happen immedi-
ately. While working with individuals in an effort
to study their needs and to assist them with their
difficulties, I found myself constantly recommend—
ing some kind of group activity to them, actually to
be regarded as part of their therapy. And, in
many, many instances, these individuals have bene-
fited immeasurably from their participation in such
activities. It would seem that the wheel has turned
full circle! As a matter of fact, it has swung past
its starting point—in our own clinic we are now
initiating group therapy with our patients because
it has been found to be beneficial to people with
common problems and complaints to share them
with others and to learn from each other. This
tells us something important about the values of
groups as such.

My purpose in describing this individual experi—
ence is to get us to begin to see the close relation—
ship between group work and recreation and men-
tal health. We talk a great deal nowadays about
prevention, about keeping unfortunate and un-

happy things from happening to people. Medicine
is full of examples of this. We take typhoid shots,
whooping cough shots; we require vaccination
against smallpox; we employ Patch tests for the
early detection of tuberculosis; we encourage peri-
odic physical and dental check-ups. All of this is
wisely done to keep trouble from getting started
or, if it has done so, to catch it early, when the
chance of real cure is best. In the field of emotional
illness, we are trying to do the same kind of thing.
No one knows statistically, but I am sure it is
quite true, that all of our group work and recrea-
tional organizationshave done and are doing a
great deal towards the prevention of later difiicul-
ties, emotional in origin, which may otherwise end
in an individual having to seek Special and expert
help because of nervous or personality difFiculties.

To clarify this thought further, it is obvious
that we must move out of general statements like
the above to specific ones, and we may properly
begin to do that by defining what is meant by men-
tal health, and seeing how that definition may ap-
ply to the things which group activity is doing and
can do.towards its promotion. If we can find,
through doing this, some clues which do relate,
then the purpose of this paper will at least be
pointed up, if not exhaustively covered.

Let us, therefore, combine two definitions of

311

mental health, both of which seem to be saying
much the same kind of thing, and attempt to see
where they may apply to the field of group work
and recreation. These are drawn from the book,
The Substance of Mental Health,1 by the psychi-
atrist Dr. George H. Preston and from a report
by the Foundation for the Advancement of Psychi—
atry,2 which is a composite view of many psychi-
atrists, psychologists, psychiatric social workers
and lay persons. They state that mental health is:

I. A sense of well-being. This includes two ob-
vious factors—namely, the ability to live within the
limits imposed by our bodily equipment, both phys—
ical and mental, and the ability to live with at
least a moderate degree of happiness.

2. A feeling of efficiency at work,“ or to express
it otherwise, the ability to live usefully and con-
structively.

3. A state of harmony in human relationships,
.which implies two things: (a) the ability to get
along with others, and (b) the ability to get along
with one's self. Dr. Preston calls this latter qual—
ity a certain freedom from being a nuisance. ' Prob-
ably many of you are thinking but that is the func-
tion of group work and recreation programs! And
you are right. It is just that. Everything I have
seen or read lately about what’group work and rec-
reation are trying to accomplish reads very much
like a good primer of mental health.

Let us take the various parts of this definition
and expand them into a few concrete examples.
Take the point of having a sense of well-being.
Anyone who has been concerned with either chil-
dren or adults in group settings is almost immedi-
ately aware of the differences in physical well*
being or bodily equipment of the individuals in that
group. Some of them are too fat; some are too
thin; some are too tall; some too short. We have
freckles, protruding teeth, wear glasses and some
of us who don’t wear them, should. We vary much
in our physical energy, and some of us are actually
handicapped from chronic illnesses. And so we
thereby vary in our ability to participate and be-
come skillful in many activities, group or other-
wise. .As leaders of the group, aware of these in-
dividual differences, we have a golden opportunity
to gear our program accordingly. It is true we
cannot change the color of people’s eyes, or the
fact that Johnny’s motor responses may be a good
bit slower than those of Bill’s ;but every good group
work or recreation program has in it a basic con-

cern for this health-factor and, if we are skillful
leaders, we can do much to promote this phase of
mental hygiene according to individual needs and
abilities. We can plan groups within groups so
that pe0ple of fairly equal physical ability compete
with each other—instead of the poorest among us
always being the losers to the best. In addition,
we can do much toward helping an individual to
accept the limitations imposed by nature, and to
see to it that the group accepts those limitations,
too. Perhaps an extreme example of this is the
advocacy by the most up—to-date physical and men-
tal therapists of not making “special” groups of
outrightly physically handicapped people, but of
welding them into normal groups, so far as possible,
within the limits of their ability to participate.
Here is mental hygiene at its best, because it at-.
tempts to minimize a difficulty that is real, and at-
tempts to. create a situation wherein an individual
who has‘reason to feel.“different” is given an 0p-
portunity to feel quite normal, quite like everyone
else.

On the other side of this sense of well—being is
the factor we have called happiness. This is, of
course, a strictly emotional factor, basic to mental
health. All of you, no doubt, _observed in groups
with which you have been dealing the great variety
of expressions of happiness in people, or their lack
of it. We have all seen the person who is happy,
the one to whom everyone gravitates, wlio is out-
going and cheerful, well-liked by all, and who, by
this very attitude, contributes so much to the group
as a whole. And we all have _seen those others who
enter a group by hanging around the edge of it,
or who are sullen, or even those who cause friction
or disturbance in the group—the poor sports who
have not learned the meaning of cooperation. An-
other example of a person less happy is one who
is too shy, unable to participate and be part of the
group. You, yourselves, could list many other
kinds of behavior which indicate people who are
not too happy.

In dealing with this factor of mental health, we,
as group leaders, cannot do much about causes,
because the basic reasons producing these difficul—
ties stem from sources outside our immediate con-
trol or function. They come most often from rather
poor relationships within the family circle. But
although we cannot do much about the things
which are causing members of our groups to act
in these various ways, it is not too important for
our purposes that we cannot. Our job here lies in
knowing and being aware of these causes, it is
true, and of trying—at least while we are working
with these less happy individuals—to do some

RECREATION

rather simple things which possibly will help alle-
viate such conflicts or, possibly in some cases, mod-
ify such feelings. We can certainly help a. shy indi-
vidual toward overcoming that difficulty and gain-
ing more self-confidence. We can find something
that this person can do and help create a situation
in which he or she can do it. We can also do some-
thing about a person who is sullen—our own smile
and attitude of friendliness

and acceptance is one device.

We do not need to know

why the person is sullen or %
shy to do this much. We can

probably help the individual I

who is a disturbance to learn

to take his or her place more

quietly and c00peratively. I

am sure that you could all

cite a dozen examples of your own handling of
small problems such as these. As group leaders,
we have a continuous opportunity, if we are aware
of emotional variations in our groups, to do a great
deal toward helping others realize a happier atti-
tude, more of this sense of well-being about which
we are talking.

,- The‘secOnd factor in mental health is the ability
to live usefully, to be efficient at some kind of work
or activity. To this point, it would seem that prac-
tically one hundred per cent of group and recrea-
tional activities can contribute. In all of our group
work and recreation programs, there is such a
rich variety of activity offered that almost anyone
can be busy at doing something that he likes, can
learn to do fairly well, from which he can derive
a feeling of achievement, satisfaction and recogni-
tion. If we were to start mentioning examples of
this, we would be able to list a hundred or more
such activities, and would end with a complete ros-
ter of all the things which we know, from experi-
ence and experiment, that people like to do. Our
job as leaders, of course, is the providing of these
very many interesting things which can be done,
and the giving to each individual in our group the
chance to explore these programs to his liking.
Our final job as mental therapists in this area is
to see to it that recognition comes from this—rec-
ognition of a job attractively and satisfactorily done.
All group work and recreation programs carry out
these procedures almost automatically. We have
swimming meets, physical contests, exhibits and
performances wherein we put the results of our
work on display. For children we have ribbons,
badges, ranks and so on. All of these are good from
the standpoint of contributing to our mental health,
of making us feel useful, of importance, needed.

NOVEMBER 1950

Our third factor in mental health is a state of
harmony in human relationships, which we said
earlier denotes the ability to get along with others
and the ability to get along with ourselves. Basi-
cally again, if we, as individuals, achieve this most
important attitude toward life, it is done most of-
ten within the family circle. (Read “What Makes
It Bounce?” page 295). But quite aside from the
fact that, as we said before, we cannot control
whether or not this has been learned, we can—
through group relationships and group interaction
—do a great deal to promote this phase of mental
health. The very nature of the group itself is a
replica, on a larger scale, of a family group, and
our opportunity is endless, through group leader-
ship, of helping everyone in our groups to learn the
habit of cooperating with others. This is an essen-
tial to twentieth century living. Group work and
recreation agencies have all sorts of well-estab-
lished and successful devices which.have been
worked out for this. We have patrols and patrol
leaders; we have committees and their chairmen,
teams and team captains, discussion groups and
discussion leaders. We work and play together;
we give and take; we contribute our share of work
and ideas; and we, in turn, learn to accept the
ideas of others. Sometimes we .are leaders, and
sometimes followers—and we should learn to do
both well. I know of nothing which can, should
and does contribute more to good mental health
along this line than groups as such. Our job as
group leaders is a tremendous one since upon us
rests the ob of moderating and welding all of these
Opinions and differences, plans and ideas, into a
fruitful and rewarding experience for the whole.
I would say, as so many others have said, that in
teaching the best meaning of harmony in these hu-
man relationships, we are not only promoting good
mental health, but we are also teaching a great
deal about democracy itself.

In the other phase of harmony in human rela-
tionships, we have the important quality of learn-
ing to get along with one’s self. Here, again, we
learn or do not learn this important attitude at
home. Many of us do not learn it, and to name
a few of the traits which show we are not learning
it, we have people who gripe and whine, who feel
sorry for themselves, who are suspicious, have
feelings of inferiority, are anxious and fearful or
generally belligerent and distrustful in their atti-
tudes towards others and towards the world. They
are the “nuisances” about whom Dr. Preston talks.
They are emotionally ill people, mildly so, but
nevertheless, emotionally ill.

Our job begins as they come into our groups.

313

It is to accept them as we find them, and again to
use those tools and devices of all group leadership
in trying to assist these people, at least while they
are with us, to take a new attitude, a healthier at-
titude, towards themselves and thus towards life.

From the foregoing outline of this close relation-
ship between group work, recreation and mental
health, I hope that you have caught something of

the feeling that, as group workers, you are con-
cerned with much more than putting on successful
programs which are interesting and good in them-
selves. You are, in reality, on the very front line
of preventive mental hygiene; at a point where, if
anything happens at all, it happens at the time and
place where it can do the most good to the largest
number in a most significant and important way.

Civic Award

The Fraternal Order of thenEagles, in Amster-
dam, New York, makes awards for outstanding
civic service. These awards are the highest honor
and are not given lightly. In fact, only three such
awards have been given in the past fifteen years.
The last and third has been presented to Alexander
Isabel, superintendent of recreation, for outstand-
ing service to the youth of Amsterdam. In the
last four years, Mr. Isabel has increased his bud—
get from $15,000 to $47,000, and placed public
recreation in the foreground in his community.

SANTA CLAUS, that bewhiskered gent who is
a fixture of the department store as well as a fix-
ture in the eyes of children at Christmastime, can
be made to do wonders for your recreation depart-
ment during the Yule season. You can do it by
taking him out of the department store, literally.

At least that’s our experience, and we offer the
following details to substantiate the claim that
Santa can give your program a “shot in the arm”
and bring much favorable comment to your depart-
ment from the public which supports you through
the tax dollar.

Let me take you back to a day in December of
1949. Three of us in the department were discus-
sing what could be done to further the Christmas
spirit in our Roseville, Michigan, community.

“Why not bring Santa Claus here as an aid to
parents P" one suggested. “In previous years, par-
ents have had to take their children to Detroit if
they wanted them to see Santa personally. We
can save them the ordeal of such a trip and, at the
same time, focus attention on our own depart-
ment.”

It didn’t take too long to do the planning. Nat-
urally, a Santa Claus had to be found. He was
“discovered” in exactly three seconds when our
chief playground supervisor, accustomed to hand-
ling children, volunteered for the task.

Then, of course, Santa had to have some candy
to give to each guest. A visit was made toa._whole-
saler of confections who had just what we wanted
Tsuckers and gumdrops—at a price we could af-
ford to pay. Cellophane sacks were purchased, and
the candy was sacked at our leisure.

The wheels of public relations began to roll.

A Bewhiskered Visitor

Stories concerning Santa’s approaching visit were
prepared for the community newspaper, and let-
ters were written to school superintendents urging
them to make known the fact to their teachers, es-
pecially those teachers of kindergarten and lower
elementary grades.

Santa’s “mailbox”—a potato chip can festooned
with the colors of the Yule season—was prepared.
The press releases and letters to the schools pointed
out that boys and girls could prepare their letter
to Santa in advance and drop it off in Santa’s
mailbox when they came to the community center
on the designated day.

Our program called for Santa to be present from
three to five in the afternoon and from seven-thirty
to eight-thirty in the evening. Prior to his evening
visit, a group of Girl Scouts sang Christmas carols,
climaxed by the lighting of a community tree.

To the surprise of all of us, our “spur-of—the-
moment” Christmas program attracted more than
1,000 children and parents. Santa listened briefly
to all their “wants,” and was a tired but happy
individual when he started back to the North Pole.

Although completely satisfied with the results,
we were guilty of one oversight: the announcement
of Santa’s visit was not published early enough
and many parents already had taken their children
to Detroit to visit Toyland and Santa. Now we-
realize that an announcement during the latter
part of November would not be rushing things,
especially if the community is one that must rely
extensively on a weekly newspaper.

Early or late, however, you can’t go wrong with
Santa boosting your program. It may be more
blessed to give than to receive, but in this case you
will find the cliche reversed, with your department
receiving much for giving comparatively little.

WHITHER
“WESTERN”

SQUARE
DANCE?

By a Recreation Leader

   

The square dancers fumbled through the
, intricate lefts—and-rights figure like befud-

dled rats running through a maze. It was
a new “western” pattern for these experienced
dancers and the anxious caller assured them that
it was easy, just an ordinary routine. So they kept
on trying. Some got lost; some got dizzy; some
were through. The figure was a pure concoction,
a melange of left and riglit turns, reverses and
whirls; the dancers were grimly serious about it.
After about twenty minutes of practice, the caller
yelled, “I guess we’ve got it ; let’s move on to some-
thing else!” But no set really got it. I had been
carefully watching the whole floor and not a single
group had gone through it correctly.

It was my tirst experience with so-called “west-
ern” square dancing. Maybe this was an extreme.
It was—but the extreme is taking over and be-
coming usual, as I discovered later. The trick

figures and “exhibition stuff” are becoming the 

thing.

I discovered something else, tremendously sig—
nificant and both heartening and disheartening to
any lover of genuine folk dancing. What is called
“western” square dancing is not western. It is
urban, private—club dancing. It is the showily

318

sophisticated dancing of elite organizations in cer-
tain western cities. Because of the great amount
of publicity which has come their way, because
of their dominance of contests, exhibitions and
festivals, the style of dancing—-tricky, whirly—
twirly, gaudy—of these city groups has come to
be known as “western.” In the West, away from
the cities, the real \Vest of farmers, ranchers.and
miners, you see none of this. You see none of this
in the Pioneer Clubs of small towns which still
meet regularly to dance the simple, stately, grace-
ful tigures of the Old West. Exceptions may be
found in local square dance contests, themselves
the antithesis of the spirit of the folk dance, pro-
moted by county agents and Grange leaders. Here
the flashy twirls of the urbanites may be used to
gain points and beat the other team.

I, of course, have no wish to discredit all “west-
ern” dancing. Many “western” patterns are pretty
and have added bright color to the folk dance land—
scape. Certainly an exhibition by Lloyd Shaw’s
Cheyenne Mountain Dancers is, in its total effect,
a thing of beauty. However, a critical observer
will note that his exuberant youngsters overwhirl
many of their dances. A glaring example is their
interposing of “western” whirls in the Kentucky
running set. These are completely out of place in
the smooth, onward movement of the Kentucky
dance which, perhaps, is the most beautifully How—
ing of all square dance forms.

I am going to deal from here on' with the ex-
tremes of this new “western” dancing. Unfortu—
nately, these seem to be dominating the scene; and
their consequences, to say the least, are most un-
desirable.

It is ironic that today’s “western” square danc-
ing should be spawned in the Far West, where
traditions of friendliness, hospitality and demo—
cratic acceptance are still common practices of
country andg.._small—townz£olk-...1t..is._an urban, not

a rural, phenomenon, however, and is as under—

standable as any urban development pushed for-
ward by promotion and publicity. Because of its
flashiness, it lends itself readily to promotional en-
deavors and, for the same reason, is quite catchy.
An uninitiated public is easily impressed by glam-
our in the square dance field, as well as in any other

RECREATION

field. More serious, the exclusive nature of the
private clubs and exhibition groups insinuates it-
self among dancers elsewhere who fancy them—
selves highly skilled.

Observers have noted several unsavory charac—
teristics of “western” dancing. Beyond the formal
contests, which are out of place in folk dancing
anyway, competition is hectic. Callers outdo each
other in cooking up new figures. They show off
with rapid-fire changes and extravagant patter.
They want to star; they are not content with being
a regular part of the music and dance. They are
not satisfied with calling one figure, or even four,
but yell out twelve, sixteen, or twenty-—and throw
in a lot of assorted fillers. It seems that every time
couples make a move, they are called upon to do
a new figure. The square dance, in effect, becomes
a feverish contest between caller and dancers.
Moreover, no caller can call these quick changes
smoothly or stay on the beat with them; he Huffs
lines, breaks timing, crowds his patter. Nor can
the dancers execute the changes smoothly. They,
too, vie with each other in making fancy breaks,
interjecting pet stunts.

As a matter of fact, extra and prolonged whirl-
ing has increased so much that it may be cited as
the distinguishing characteristic of “western”
square dancing. It goes on for the sheer sake of
whirling, without any functional relationship to
the dance. At ordinary dances, one often sees a
corner girl spinning like a top while her corner
man frantically tries to grab her for an allemande
left—a comical instance of fancy stuff as mere
clutter. Complicated figures, stunts, tricks and

new changes have become ends in themselves——

anything fancy for the sake .of being fancy.

Such competition develops naturally into blatant
exhibitionism. Slick, trained teams go about per-
forming for duly impressed audiences. At square
dances, sets and couples display their special stunts
——which often interrupt the How of the dance. At
festivals, the urban clubs outdazzle each other with
whirling exhibitions.

“\Vestern” dancing, then, has become a stylized
routine, lacking in originality and creativeness.
The whirls and acrobatics of the exhibitionists are
not creations but concoctions. They are not in-

Many recreation leaders have

trends in “western” square
dancing and their harmful con-
sequences. This article describes

damage done, and proposes

tegral outgrowths of the dance, but artificial and
adventitious excesses.

One excess leads to another and this may be
seen in the amazingly .lavish costumes worn by
some of the “western” zealots. Even dudes and
drugstore cowboys would howl at certain gaudy
trappings worn at square dances, to say nothing of
what an old cowhand would do. There are men
dancers who look as if they stepped out of a comic
opera. At regular dances, the women extremists
wear long, Hared, starched dresses, suitable only
for exhibitions, and when the fioor is filled as is
usual, they get in the way of other dancers. There
simply isn’t room for this type of dress. Here the
words of a physical education instructor" and folk
dance teacher are apropos: “The best costume for
folk dancing is simple, comfortable clothing.”

An artist, Who is also a folk dance hobbyist, has
made an interesting interpretation of this extrem-
ism. “It may be likened,” he said, “to deve10p-
ments that are called gingerbread in architecture
and rococo in the arts.” Gingerbread is defined by
W’ebster’s dictionary as “something showy but un-
substantial or tasteless ; tawdry or superfluous orna-
ment.” Rococo, in the same lexicon, is described
as “any style of ornamentation marked by extrava-
gant curvature and ornament; . . . florid; fan-
tastic; feebly pretentious.” To continue in the
artist’s words, “Houses, once simple and beauti—
fully functional, are displaced by dwellings so ex-
cessively twisted and decorated that they lose all
compositional integrity and become ornamental
clutter. Likewise in art, a composition becomes so
overlaid with exaggerated curves and turns that
it resolves into a tortuous maze. The dance, like
any other art, therefore may become decadent, not
in the sense of degeneration, but in the sense of
excessive and dysfunctional elaboration. If the
square dance is to be modernized, it should be
streamlined, not laboriously manipulated into very
fancy filigree.”

Recreation leaders have noted
the appalling social damage done
by this inordinate trend. The fel-
lowship values inherent in folk
recreation give way to cliquishness, snobbery, ex-
clusiveness, condescension and to superiority com-
plexes. Group sharing is displaced by hectic com-
petition, relaxed enjoyment by frenzied emulation,
and sincere, wholehearted play by pretentious ex-
hibitionism. The principle of everybody joining in
is shattered by the showing off of a few.

In justice to the “western” dancers themselves,
it must be said that many are unconscious of What
their actions lead to; they do not deliberately
intend to be antisocial; but the damage is done

nevertheless.

A college recreation leader told mé that one
campus square dance club lost well over half its
membership because “other members of the club
thought that they were too good to dance with us.”

At a community center, much friction was caused

when such a group left the organization to go its
own exhibitionistic way—a typical example of the
practice of forming choice, exclusive clubs. A
common reaction of these dancerS‘toward sugges-
tions for occasional mixing with others and ex-
changing partners is: “W’e don’t want to get stuck
with some dope all night.”

All this leads to a self-satisfied provincialism re—
garding other regions and to an air of condescen-
sion, even disdain, toward rural folk. The simpler
square dances and play party games of the Middle
West, for instance, are looked down upon as “kid
stuff.” The “western” dance festival, then, is not
a real folk festival; it is a get-together of urban
dance clubs. Rural groups simply don’t belong.

Country folk are not unaware of what has been
going on. An old-time dance musician declared to
me at a farrriers’ meeting: “Years ago, Shaw took
our dances away from us.’ Now the city folks and
dudes have ’em and they’ve gotten so fancy and
so snooty that we can’t dance ’em.” Folklorists who
seek reasons for the decline of the folk arts might
well ponder the statements of this farmer.

In view of what has been said, the time is surely
ripe 'for “western” leaders and devotees to re-
examine what they are doing and to re-educate
themselves in regard to the values of folk recrea-
tion in general and folk dancing in particular.
They might consider, with profit, the principles of
folk recreation as enunciated at a recent rural rec—

reation workshop—namely, that folk recreation is
first of all people’s recreation, the kind in which
common folk get together as friends and neigh—

bors and share a good time; it is
good neighbor recreation ; its main
goal is fellowship; it is homemade,
in other words, family—made,
neighborhood-made, community-made; it is coop-
erative, not competitive; it is simple and sincere,

not exhibitionistic; it is nonprofit, not commercial,

They might learn that simplicity in folk dancing
may be just as beautiful as complexity, that there
is greater variety and pleasure in the many simple
figures available than in the maze—complications
devised by zealous innovators. They might rec-
ognize that if they want to help in the evolution of
the square dance, they should make changes in
streamlined fashion and integral to its basic design,
not tack on a lot of irrelevant ornamentation. And
they might come out of their smug provincialism.

A western recreation leader has this to say about
the situation: “I, too, spre am concerned over this
trend of ‘Western’ dancing in becoming too t0p-
heavy in squares, with complicated and changing
figures and calls. I wonder if it won’t kill dancing
for plain recreational activity and stay on purely
for exhibition. The rural flavor I’ve been trying
to give it has been acceptable and successful every-
where except with those who have mastered the
complicated hash and want me to sling it to them.
Most people don’t want to strain at learning new

and difficult figures, but just want to do some easy ’

relaxing dancing. Why can’t people ’see that the
world is complicated enough and not become schiz-
Ophrenics in their recreation, too?”

The future of “western” square dancing is a
matter of sociological conjecture. Maybe it will
collapse of its own weight of excesses. Maybe it
will go the ballyhoo way of the promoters and wax
more “stupendous,” “colossal”-———to become an-
other American circus. More likely, the trend will
be somewhere in—between. The activities of recre-
ation leaders and organizations and of those ex-
ponents of “western” dancing, grown tired of its
extravagances, may set up a counter-trend. In that
case, “western” folk dancing will come into its own
as a genuine regional type; and our American folk
culture will be that much more enriched.

JAPAN RECREATIM ASSIJCIATIIIN

HE FOURTH CONGRESS of the National Recrea-

tion Association of Japan held a notably suc-
cessful session in the far northern city of Obihiro,
Hokkaido Island, July 24 to 27. It drew men and
women, to the number of. 1,050, from thirty-one
prefectures and Hokkaido. The appreciation of
both the association officials and the body of dele-
gates for the friendly cooperation of the American
NRA in taking pains to be represented was re-
peatedly manifested, and I felt highly honored to
be an American representative. Pending enact—
ment of a peace treaty, every evidence that Japa-
nese organizations are being treated as equals by
their opposite numbers in’ the Occident directly
helps to restore their self-respect.

Besides Mrs.- Fisher and myself, the Americans
present were Messrs. T. K. Tindale and W. P.
Niblo, civilian officials of SCAP. Had not military
leaves been cancelled because of the Korean war,
Miss Katherine Donaldson, Mrs. Marcia Lystad
and Miss Amy Henley would also have attended
as American representatives.

The presence and active participation of Prince
and Princess Mikasa threw a glamor over the
whole assemblage. Their unaffected simplicity and

evident relish of the chance to mingle with the
commonalty won all hearts, and they received an
ovation everywhere they appeared. As I was
designated Chief American Delegate, Mrs. Fisher
and I were accorded almost embarrassing cour-
tesies, being customarily seated next to the Prince
and Princess.

The Japanese talent for organization and imagina-
tive planning appeared in the elaborate program
and local arrangements. Great credit is due the -
president of the association, Honorable Soichi
Saito, and his executive associates, as well as the
host of public officials and volunteer committeemen
in Hokkaido.

The daytime program consisted "almost entirely
of parallel forums and round-table discussions,
each attended by from one to two hundred per-
sons and meeting a total of twelve hours. In them,
recreation was considered from practically all
angles: as to occupation; population units, urban
and rural; auspices, public and private; and so
forth. Group discussion is not new to Japan, but
in olden times it was cramped by excessive defer-
ence to age and rank. Therefore, it -was most
impressive to witness at Obihiro discussions as
lively and uninhibited as at most similar gatherings
in America. It strengthened one’s confidence that
democracy will ultimately take root in Japan.

There were creditable exhibits of craftsmanship.

321

painting and photography by both school children
and adults. The most exquisite creations were the
miniature landscapes and waterscapes, in which the
Japanese excelr—an art known as bonsai. lf speci-
mens of such handiwork were to be sent to North
America, they would attract admiring throngs.

Square dancing was introduced to Japan by Mr.
Niblo, and has already become amazingly popular.
During the congress, a score of teams from various
parts of the country filled to capacity the large
hall of the high school, and their surprisingly
graceful and decorous gyrations made a pictur-
esque spectacle. Now that Japanese girls all wear
W'estern—style dresses and shoes, they have come to
walk and dance with a freedom and grace quite
impossible in the former garb. The Japanese sense
of rhythm is so good that Mr. N iblo says they catch
on to square dances more readily than American
youth. As a fillip for the occasion, he had devised
a new hgure which he called the “Mikasa Odori”
(dance), and it was performed for the first time
by a clever set in which the Prince himself danced
with skill and evident delight.

In the opening session of the congress, it fell
to me to present the formal greetings of the
American NRA and, later on, to make a short
address on “Recreation and Democracy.” Both
were well-received. In the course of my address,
I had remarked that the pleasures of recreation
were most universally enjoyed where democracy
prevailed: When questions and comments were
called for by the chairman, the first question was:
“Does Dr. Fisher recognize that this is true of the
Soviet people P” I at once replied that in respect
to p0pular recreation, it appeared to be true in the
Soviet Union, but that in respect tor-some other
aspects of life, the democratic principle did not
prevail. Whereupon, the audience applauded with
unusual vigor, apparently to show that the ques-
tioner, if attempting to put in a plug for the USSR,
had few, if any, supporters among the other dele—
gates. In view of the considerable vogue of com—
munism among college students, this was a some-
what unexpected demonstration.

Among the resolutions ad0pted was a strong
“Declaration on Recreation and International
Peace,” another calling for the sending of Japanese
delegates to the next convention of the American
N RA, and still another requesting UNESCO to ex—
tend its activities in the field of recreation.

During the last two evenings of the congress,
eleven medieval dramatic dances were performed
by artists who came from as many different parts
of the country. They made a glamorous and unique

322

spectacle. Never before, it was said, had all these
dances been performed in one place. On the hrst
night they were given outdoors, under floodlights,
before a crowd of at least 30,000 persons who stood
spellbound for three hours. On the second night,
they were given indoors. The themes were drawn
from feudal folklore, ranging from tragedy to bur-
lesque. Among the spectators on the first night
were the Prince and Princess Mikasa, who seemed
to revel in the dances as keenly as the simple
folk who crowded all around them. One could not
help feeling sorry for the handicaps of royalty
when, half-way through the performance, a func-
tionary whispered to their Highnesses that they
must leave for another function. They left with
obvious reluctance.

The congress gave recreation in Japan a power-
ful stimulus, and evidenced a strong desire to join
hands with the American NRA in advancing the
general cause of constructive recreation. Especially
in the esthetic field, we Americans may well take
lessons from our Japanese confreres ; and in skiing,
baseball, swimming and square dancing, they will
be friendly rivals. In the provision of supervised
camps for boys and girls and of well-equipped,
directed playgrounds, they can learn from America.

AN ISLAND STORY

‘6 0U KNOW, Mrs. Ludlow, the trouble with

YMercer Island is that too many people try
to put on community projects all by themselves.
What we need is a coordinated approach to com-
munity recreation.”

“Hmm, I think you’re right,” replied Mary
Ludlow, a Camp Fire Girl guardian who was talk-
ing to Les \Villiams,' Mercer Island School's
physical education director, about a spring dance
festival. And with that began the action that led
to the Mercer Island Recreation Council and one
of the finest small community recreation programs
in the country. ‘

Mrs. Ludlow approached Rob Studebaker, su-
perintendent of schools, who nodded his head in

approval. “I’ll talk it over with the PTA and
call a meeting,” he said. Thus four thousand
people living on an island five miles long and two
miles wide, right smack in the middle of Lake
Washington, just fifteen minutes from downtown.
Seattle, began the organization that made the sum-
mer of 1948 a rich, meaningful experience for three
hundred youngsters of grade school age who call
Mercer Island their community.

These youngsters and their parents live in com—
munities that cannot be designated as cities or
towns. Their only official form of government is
their school district, their county, and their occa-
sional fire, water and hospital districts. Of great
significance are the extra-legal, informal, self-
government groups they establish as community
clubs or conununity councils. At their best, such
organizations bring fresh, invigorating democratic
self-action that reaches into every aspect of group
living. I

“We must have a playground.” said Mercer
Island through its newly-formed recreation council.
And, like many another community of homes scat-
tered throughout a sparsely-settled area, Mercer
Island almost made the mistake of planning a rec-
reation program which was facility-centered. For-
tunately, Mrs. Ruth Prosser, the newly-elected

- chairman of the council, and her able associates

thought also in terms of recreation activities. A
questionnaire was distributed throughout the
school.

“\Vhat activities would you most like to partici-
pate in this summer?” the council inquired of the
grade school youngsters. “Playground activities?”
Only a few of the youngsters seemed interested.
“Swimming?” “Oh boy!” Everyone was inter-
ested in swimming. Also, a couple of hundred
little hands checked off such items as nature hikes,
creative art and creative dramatics.

Through the coordinated efforts of the King

323

County Park and Playground Department, the
Mercer Island school district and the recreation
council, the necessary funds were raised to hire
recreation specialists for each activity. Because
“all” communities had playgrounds, a playground
director was recruited through the King County
Park and Playground Department to conduct the
usual diversified playground program and also to
see that the other specialists, the children and the
location got together at the same time and on the

same day.

Setting a Pattern

0f the youngsters eligible to participate in the
program, over 130 signed up for creative art
classes. The quality of the instruction is indicated
by the fact that the attendance never fell below
120 all through the eight weeks of the program.
Over sixty wide-eyed youngsters made collections
of bugs, rocks, leaves and bark; took hikes; saw
nature movies under the guidance of a high school
biology teacher who had spent many summers as a
guide at Mount Rainier National Park. In spite of
considerable rain and chilly weather during the
program, over seventy American Red Cross swim-
ming awards were presented by King County
water safety instructors who conducted swimming
lessons at a near—by county beach twice a week.
Under the direction of a specialist in creative dra-
matics from the University of Washington, thirty
Mercer Island youngsters thrilled to the make—
believe of spontaneous dramatic play.

There is much more that could be said about the
summer of 1948 on Mercer Island—the wonderful
community spirit and cooperation; the new ap-
proaches to publicity and public relations; the loud,
spontaneous outbreak of applause from the young-
sters for their playground director on the final day
of the summer program. But the really important
thing is that Mercer Island had established some-
thing of a pattern for recreation programs in non-
urban communities.

That ,Mercer Island was able to do this with no
local government speaks well for the people of the
island who are communityeminded, democratic,
and forward—looking. To no small measure, how-
ever, must this success be attributed to the subsidy
program of the State Department of Public In—
struction—through which money is made available
to local school districts for summer recreation
leadership—and to the King County Park ',and
Playground Department, which assisted through
its swimming program and by providing half of. the
playground director’s salary and professional su—'
pervision and consultation.

Finger painting is always popular with the young

Park and Playground Department

Faced with the responsibility of providing parks
and recreation for some 150,000 people in non-
urban King County, the ten—year—old county de-
partment moves through the two thousand square
miles of its constituency repeating the “Mercer
Island Story.” It is in this experience that lies the
hope of leisure—time activities, through a com—
munity recreation program for so many areas not
at all or partially served by community agencies.

Established in 1938, the King County Park and
Playground Department was fathered by the WPA
and mothered by informal community clubs. It
was the intent, at the time of its organization, to
secure land through donations, buildings through
W PA, and maintenance and operation from com-
munity clubs and agencies. Until 1943, it was
possible for the department to achieve the results
intended. with an annual expenditure of only
$66,000 of county tax funds. From 1943 to 1947,

the budget climbed to $145,000, with no limit in p

Sight of the amount necessary to meet the needs
of all the local communities for facilities. operation,
maintenance and leadership. In the ten year period
to 1948, however, the county acquired some 231
acres of. property, and over 163 acres have been
developed for recreation use so far.

a. . RECREATION

Five large community centers with gymnasiums,
and one with an indoor swimming pool, were con-
structed during this period. Five smaller build-
ings—wranging from basement rooms to community
centers without gymnasiums—-—also are a part of
the county park system. Other property includes
three beaches on Lake \Vashington, one on Puget
Sound, and four neighborhood playgrounds.

The natural neighborhood in a nonurban area
rarely exceeds a population of more than several
thousand, and usually the geographic area runs
into several square miles. The density figure for
King County, for instance, is less than three
hundred people per square mile. To have a county
building program for each neighborhood would
manifestly run into astronomical figures. It is for
this reason that the “Mercer Island Story” is
particularly significant. Mercer Island has demon-
strated that, by utilizing all of its resources, a
nonurban community can provide a really effective
recreation program without extensive building and
outdoor facilities. As a matter of fact, the ex-
perience of Mercer Island shows that those pro-
grams which best succeed are those which are
activity-centered, not necessarily facility-centered.
Programs which are centered on specific facilities
too often are limited by their character.

In urban areas of heavy population, the play-
ground and community center serve an ever con-
stant stream of patrons. There are always many
people, at any time of day, who are eager to
participate in the program. Not so in the less
populated rural areas. It takes a real effort to get
Sister Sue or Brother Bob over three miles of
unpaved roads to a recreation area. Day-long play-
ground programs live days a week under such
circumstances are simply futile.

Building a Program

Not a building program, but building a program
adapted to these areas is the concern of the King
County Park and Playground Department today.
To this end, the department instituted a camping
program during the summer so that hundreds of
youngsters from Mercer Island and other county
communities might have the experience of living
out-of—doors under capable camp guidance for two
and three-day periods. Since it was also con-
sidered important to enable every youngster to
learn to swim, a roving team of water safety in—
structors was available for concentrated learn-to-
swim campaigns wherever there was a sufficient
number of youngsters.

responsibility for its own recreation. Its “story” is
proof that sparsely—populated rural areas can
achieve high quality recreation programs through
effective organization and utilization of all the com-
munity’s resources, and by emphasizing activities
rather than facilities.

A program giving recognition to all year-round

THE

 

Approximately two

years were spent by the rec-
reation department of Denver in securing infor-
mation on what other cities had done with a
Mayor’s Christmas Party. After assembling and
evaluating the information and correlating it to the
physical and management possibilities in Denver,
:1 Mayor’s Christmas Party was set for Christmas
\Veek, 1949.

The party was planned for the boys and girls
who participate in year—round recreation and
character-building organizations in Denver. These
young people are members of :  I) the twelve year—
round municipal recreation centers; (2) the ten
year-round Community Chest centers; (3) church
groups which sponsor year-round activities for
youth; (4) national agencies, such as the YMCA,
Y\VCA. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts,,Camp Fire Girls,
Blue Birds, and so on; (5) local orphanages. It
was decided that the age range should be eight
to twelve years inclusive. This was necessary be—
cause our largest facility can accommodate only
7,000 attendants, while there are roughly 25,000
Denver children registered in one or more of these
agencies.

Invitations to the executives of the above organi—
zations were prepared six weeks before Christmas
Day. Each invitation was a personal letter from
the mayor to the executive, requesting that the
recreation department be notifledt of the number of
admission tickets desired.

The other city departments whose help was
necessary in order to put over such a mass pro—
gram included the parks department, with its

trucks and maintenance crews; the city electrical
department, for lighting the Christmas trees and
the stage; the supplies office, in charge of the city
auditorium and annex—the facility used; the fire
department, for protection of those in attendance
as well as for the distribution of gifts at the close
of the program ; and the police department, for con-
trolling the crowd inside and outside the facility.
Parking was restricted on all four sides of the
block in order that children leaving busses, auto—
mobiles and tram cars would not be endangered.

In order to secure adequate publicity, a one-
newspaper sponsorship was arranged with the
Denver Post, an evening paper. It provided many
column inches plus pictures before the party, and
gave complete coverage of the party. In addition,
the Post arranged for the one—hour show, which
this year was a variety show put on by the young
people. The paper further solicited and arranged
for the delivery to the auditorium of a gift package
for each child present. The contents consisted of
a bag of candy, a bag of nuts and a choice of
fruit—all contributed by local merchants.

Through the James Petrillo Radio and Tran—
scription Fund, the local musicians’ union fur-
nished a ten—piece orchestra as well as someone to
play the large pipe organ in the auditorium. The
Denver Tramway Company supplied free transpor-
tation to and from the party for all who were
guests of the mayor—both children and adult
chaperons. We used a ratio of one chaperon to
every twelve children.

The ticket of admission, distributed to all
agencies, was a tag board perforated in such a
manner that the tramway courtesy fare coupon to
the party was the flrst tear—off; the second tab
was admission to the auditorium; the third, for re—

turn on the tramway; and the top tab, a momento

The recreation department assumed complete
responsibility for coordinating the work of all co-
operating agencies. In addition, forty year-round
recreation leaders, properly identified, were sta—

tioned at key spots in the auditorium to facilitate '

entry to the proper section, as well as to control
the dismissal by sections, thus assuring proper
order and decorum in the lines formed then and
for the distribution of gifts by the firemen who had
volunteered their services. The party proper was
scheduled for nine-thirty to eleven a.m., on the
Saturday preceding Christmas.

Tramway busses, which had been well-advertised
in the Denver Post, appeared at specified pick-up
points throughout the city, and the groups were
‘ carried directly to and from the auditorium. The
doors were opened at nine am. As they filed in,
each guest was given a program which carried a
greeting from the Mayor and the verses of the
songs to be sung. We filled the building from the
bottom up, section by section. Distribution of
tickets had purposely been limited tb 8,000 boys
and girls; and so good was our guess that 7,116
appeared—within one hundred of the maximum
limit permitted by the fire department.

At nine-thirty, the organ started playing Christ-
mas music, while the auditorium was filling. All
busses had discharged the guests on or before nine-
forty, and at nine-forty-five a community song
leader led the assembled gathering for fifteen
minutes of mass singing. This part of the program
was so well done that, another year, we plan to
broadcast this first fifteen minutes. At ten the
Mayor was introduced and gave a sixty-second
welcome, after which the forty-five minute variety

NOVEMBER 1950

show began. At its close, the dismissal of attend-
ance was handled with the help of the public
address system, and the auditorium was emptied
in twenty minutes. In the adjoining annex, the gift
distribution tables were arranged in five aisles;
and under the direction of recreation leaders, every
child left with a gift.

Tramway cars surrounded the building, properly
labeled, and the children were removed from the
streets within thirty minutes.

In a rehash meeting of our recreation people
during the following week, we found few things
to eliminate or change in the party management.
We believe that the restricting of invitations to
youngsters who participate in year—round activi-
ties pointed up recognition of those agencies doing
year-round youth-serving work. Our answer to
our critics about the "underprivileged" was: “No
youth in Denver is underprivileged in the oppor-
tunity to participate in year-round recreation and
character-building programs!” There is an agency
within walking distance of every home or a home
meeting group of a national agency. \V e do not
like the word “underprivileged” in the recreation
department unless it is defined as underprivileged
educationally, economically and so forth.

“7 e feel that the Mayor’s Christmas Party
focused the city’s attention upon private. quasi-
public and public agencies, and that it made many
friends for the city with the press, parents, and
with critics who watched the program.

Every community, regardless of size, could stage
such an affair, working out its own controls based
upon adequate indoor handling of mass attendance,
solution of the transportation problem and ade-
quate advanced preparation, plus capable manage-
ment on the day of the activity.

CARNIVAL DAYS are
happy days for the young
and the Old. This holds
true in the cities of Tona-
wanda and North Tona—
wanda, where T—NT, as
the two areas are called in western New York,
now have an entirely new and different carnival
season for which everyone has high praise. This
new wrinkle in entertainment is a summer sports
carnival of a month’s duration, planned as early as
the preceding December—a carnival designed for
recreation, entertainment, and the extension of
good will.

In August, the North Tonawanda Recreation
Department, with its cross-canal twin of Tona-
wanda, ties up the cities’ sports year with a sports
festival embracing all possible athletic events. Each
and every day in the month is designated for some
Sports event. The contestants are imported sports
figures as well as registered entrants. And anyone
. who thinks he can qualify, regardless of color,
creed or residence, can enter.

The carnival is arranged to provide fun for peo-
ple who love fast-moving events as well as for
those who go in for the more quiet, less strenuous
exhibitions of skill. It is for men and women, for
those who excel in sports as well as for those who
wish to learn.

The Tonawandas, situated midway between the
metropolis of Buffalo and scenic Niagara Falls,
have a total population of almost 50,000. In 1947,
the two cities observed their golden jubilee and,
as part of the celebration, a small sports program
was initiated. It was then that the idea of a sports
program on a carnival level came to William “Pop”
Ramsey, recreation director of NT.

He sold the plan to the recreation director of

was the office of the Ton‘awanda Evening News,
where the idea was presented to the paper’s presi—
dent. Then and there it was decided that this was
a revolutionary idea in a sports program; and in
December of 1948, the 1949 T-NT Summer Sports
Carnival began to be formulated.

It was agreed that each city would donate $1,000
to the carnival. The News agreed to make good on
all expenses over this budget. \Vith money to act
as a basis, the next step was to arrange a meeting
of various organizations in the twin cities. The
plan was presented to the clubs’ representatives,
who were told that they could choose any Sport
they desired. It would be the clubs’ reSponsibility
to organize the activities for a day and to supply
the awards. To this proposition, twenty-one or-
ganizations responded.

The program, however, soon outgrew its orig—
inal proportions. Letters explaining the situation
were sent to local industrial plants. They responded
generously and, with adequate linancial backing,
the carnival began to take shape.

'- First, the program was incorporated. In antici-
pation of accidents, insurance was taken out to
cover not only the participants in the athletic
events, but spectators as well. Meetings were
scheduled to be held twice weekly, and the news-
paper editors took care of the publicity. The car—
nival was publicized directly not only in the twin
cities, but within a radius of two hundred miles in
both the United States and Canada.

When the tinal program was drafted, it em—
braced twenty-live different events. Sunday, July
31, was selected as opening day and September 5,
Labor Day, as the closing day.

With the Niagara River handy, it was decided
that on opening day motor boat races and the
regatta would be held. Prior to the races, a con-
test was planned to get a name for the affair. In-

RECREATION

terest was further stimulated when top men in the
racing world were secured by the junior chambers
of commerce.

The following day, Monday, a basketball tourna-
ment and clinic were inaugurated, scheduled for
one day in Tonawanda and the next in North
Tonawanda. The Kiwanis club secured the serv-
ices of well-known Joe Niland, basketball coach of
Canisius College, to conduct the event. Each day
Niland gave basketball pointers, held scrinnnages
and, on the last day, arranged an all-star game
between players from the respective cities.

On August 3, the Niagara River was again put
to use. This time, a mile and three-quarter swim-
ming race was held. The News sponsored the
event and obtained the great Yale swimming coach,
Bob Kiputh, for a referee and judge. A Tona-
wanda athlete, he rode the leading cruiser while
refereeing the race. The contest drew twenty-one
entrants, including two girls. For protection and
safety-first, each swimmer was accompanied by
motor watercraft. ' '

On succeeding days, a lacrosse game, a trap and
skeet event, a football clinic—similar to the basket-
ball clinic, a greasy pole race, water games and a
canoe race were held.

Saturday saw an airplane model contest and a
kite-flying contest. These events drew contestants
from as far as the southernmost part of Pennsyl-
vania.

Sunday, which marked the midpoint of the car-
nival, featured a bike race through the center of
Tonawanda. Streets were blocked off to avoid-any
possible car—bicycle accidents. As the cyclers cir-
cled their route, balloon tire races were held. To
make it all-inclusive, even tricycle races were on

i the program.

On August I 5, the Sikora American Legion Post
conducted a baseball clinic that drew an attendance
of over five hundred youngsters. Professional ball
players from the Buffalo baseball club sent four
players who had their hands full showing the tricks
of baseball'and answering questions. Billy DeMars,
now of. the St. Louis Browns, was so impressed by
the enthusiastic response that he remarked: “I
certainly enjoyed this as much as I do my regular
baseball.”

\Vhen the program was being planned, it was
learned that an archery team would be passing
through Buffalo on its return from an archery
exhibition in Boston. These archers were per-
suaded to stop over in the Tonawandas and put on
an exhibition, on the eighteenth of August.

The golf hole-in-one tournament was held on
the seventeenth and eighteenth, attracting hun-

NOVEMBER 1950

dreds of golfers as well as hundreds of others who
were trying their first swing with a golf club. The
large turnout forced the tournament to run over
its schedule and it finished on the twentieth.

On Thursday, T-NT residents also witnessed
one of the oddest sporting events of the carnival:
a baseball game between the best ball club in the
twin cities and a picked all-star aggregation of ball
players who had been in their prime over fifteen
years ago. Though somewhat creaking with age,
the Old Timers, with such players as Browny \Vink-
ler— who was sought by major league teams some
twenty-odd years ago—still had enough baseball in
them to win a decision. A big party was thrown
after the ball game, and anybody who wished to
come was invited to sit in on one of the greatest
baseball bull sessions ever held in the Tonawandas.

The remainder of the carnival offered a track
and field meet, sailing races, a bait and fly-casting
contest, a week-long tennis tournament.

The feature of the closing day was a seven-mile
road race through the heart of North Tonawanda
to the hnish line at the North Tonawanda High
School Stadium, where over 4,000 people witnessed
the end of the race and the carnival-ending cere-'
monies. More than fifty runners entered the race,
including Selwyn Jones, the great Australian run-
ner who finished third in the marathon held in the
last Olympic games. Another spectacular entrant
was an amazing gent who was racing at the age of
sixty-five. Handicaps for the race were given
according to AAU standards. Jones, of course,
was the only man to start from scratch. \Vhile the
race was in progress, a band presented a concert
at the stadium, ending as the runners approached
it. With the finish of the race, the local barbershop
choir rendered old-time selections until it grew
dark enough to stage the fireworks display—cost-
ing twelve hundred dollars.

The carnival drew so much interest not only in
the twin cities, but also in surrounding areas, that
Director Ramsey decided to make this an annual
affair with new revisions to maintain interest.

A most gratifying result of the affair is the fact
that citizens and clubs cooperated so well that the
budget still boasted a little over one hundred dol-
lars! This is even more gratifying when one
realizes that the carnival was free to all. There
were no entrance fees for contestants and all equip-
ment was supplied by the recreation departments.

A Play Therapy Cart*

Josephine V. Basile, R.N.

\Vell-stocked, portable play carts are becoming
more of a familiar sight in hospitals with small
pediatric “divisions and little or no organized recre-
ational therapy. These wooden carts can be
handled easily and might be just the thing to carry
equipment for the tots on your playground.

One cart, designed specifically for hospital use,
is forty-four inches long, twenty-four inches wide
and forty-two inches high. Its wheels are large,
heavy and fitted with rubber tires. The bottom
section is divided into two drawers, each twenty
inches wide, twenty-two inches long and fifteen
inches deep. When the cover is raised, one sees
four sections, each ten-and-one-half inches wide
and twenty-three inches deep. Each section is 1a-
beled with a letter and a specific age group:

A. Birth to Three Years
Rubber-squeaking toys

B. Three to Six Years
Garden tools

Rattles Lotto game

The other has materials and directions for hand-
crafts—including wool for braided rugs, boats and
planes to be assembled, crepe paper, postal cards,
glue, colored paper, scissors, raffia and a small
cardboard hand loom.

Under the metal handle at one side of the cart
hangs a figured laundry bag which receives toys
to be washed. On the opposite end are four book
shelves labeled A, B, C and D, to correspond to
the sections of the cart.

Corresponding sections and shelves are painted
the same colors, creating a bright and gay effect.

Your Community Center Christmas

 

How about planning a Christmas party for any
servicemen stationed near-by? Here is another
opportunity for recreation leaders to be of-service
to their fellowmen.

RECREATION

Community Education and Recreation

John F. Regan

UR THEqu might well be “A Lighted School
0 —A Sign of Progress.” It is the enlightened
public school system and the enlightened public
school administrator who think of the school as
open not only from eight in the morning to three in
the afternoon, but after school hours and evenings,
open to the whole community to be used for edu-
cational and recreational pursuits. Open also dur-
ing the long summer months to be used as sum-
mer playgrounds for the youth of the community
and as centers, where the adults can meet for what-
ever activities will enrich the lives of the individual
and the whole community. This thought is not
new—but it is only very recently that anything is
being done to follow through on this phiIOSOphy.

“The strength and stability of democratic gov-
ernment depends upon the force of enlightened
public opinion,” said the preamble to the UNESCO
London Conference.1 As we ponder these words,
we would do well to remind ourselves that the
core concept of the adult education movement,
which originated in the folk schools of Denmark,
strongly stressed the improving of society by pro-
ducing and sustaining an enlightened citizenry.
\Ve also must think of it as one of the principle
means of making the democratic process effective,
and of giving the people the full use of their mass
intelligence in determining their own destiny.

As most people in the field see it, adult educa—
tion embraces whatever help in living can be had
from the recorded or communicated experiences
of others. It is made up of educational, recrea-
tional or vocational activities for everybody at all
times and in achonditions. Promoters of adult
education believe that there is a place in com-

NOVEMBER 1950

munity center programs for such educational and
recreational activities—for art, discussion of public
questions and other activities which contribute to
the betterment of ordinary living.

There are innumerable reasons given for the
existence of adult education programs. For the
sake of brevity, I will only discuss one—the fact
that the affairs of the world, including the upbring-
ing and teaching of children and adolescents, are in
the hands of adults. In order to do their jobs
adequately—whether it be in the area of good
family relations, of world affairs, or somewhere
in-between individual concerns and global issues—
men and women constantly require more knowl-
edge, deeper understanding and a chance to experi-
ment with new ideas. It often seems, however,
that what adults need most of all is an opportunity
to continue developing their creative abilities, not
only for the enjoyment to be found in creative
activities, but also for the release from nervous
tension which they give. This statement is also
apropos to the recreational activities of an adult
recreation program. Inward calm is an essential
condition for increasing one’s own perspective and
one’s grasp of another’s point of view. Only as we
acquire these attitudes shall we, as a people. be
equal to the task of building a better world.

“America has always believed in education as a
means of strengthening American democracy. Be-
cause of the dynamic period in which we are
living, many men are going, and should go, back
to school today to take courses dealing with the
change in this new age. In addition, the latest
resources within many communities are being

cation and recreation in lVatertown, Connecticut.

opened up so that they may enrich'the lives of
those who have completed their formal schooling.
Through planned study in the company of friends
and other members of the community, they are
gaining new interests, enlarging their outlooks
and developing powers of mind and personality.
Through such people, individual towns and Ameri-
can democracy in general are being strengthened.”2

Before I get into the objectives outlined for the

adult education and recreation program for VVater-

town. Connecticut's public school department, I
would like to take a little space to discuss briefiy
a problem that crops up frequently. This problem
is the question arising of where education stops
and recreation begins. The dividing line between
education, particularly adult education, and recrea-
tion is extremely difficult, if almost impossible, to
draw. There is a great deal of overlapping, and an
activity that is educational and academic to one
person would be play and recreational to another.
Recreation means doing the things which one
really wants to do. Perhaps the real and final test
of whether any activity should be considered rec-
reational must be the attitude of mind of the
person taking part in the activity. It is very true
that a great many of the activities which are fre—
quently parts of programs of adult education——
forums, crafts, music, dramatics—-are activities
which can be regarded under many circumstances

as recreation—to prove a point I made a while
back. If taking part in these activities brings a
satisfaction quite apart from any other benefits
which may also accrue, then recreation is definitely
a part of the whole adult education field.

The objectives of the adult education and rec-
reation section of the Watertown public school
system could be Outlined as follows:

I. To offer to the community those activities in
which adults would like to participate—either edu-
cational or recreational.

2. To coordinate and integrate existing facili-
ties and resources in adult education and recreation
in order to extend to as many as possible the op-
portunity for education and recreation.

3. To work in close cooperation with other
public and private agencies and citizens of the
community to promote continuing educational and
recreational opportunities for the people.

The adult education and recreation section does
not conceive itself merely as a purveyor of recre-
ation or adult education, or as seeking to establish
a set of relationships between the schools and the
community. It sees itself as a part of the town’s
school system, working in partnership with other
town services, agencies and citizens to set up and
carry through educational and recreational activi-
ties. It seeks to house, to carry on and to encourage
good neighborhood activities and to preserve and
promote increasingly pro-
ductive relations with all
those citizens, agencies and
town services forwarding
good life in our town.

The accompanying organ-
izational chart shows how
the Watertown adult edu-
cation and recreation sec—
tion is organized, the chains
of authority, the program,
and the method of financing.
This large chart was used
on many occasions as a vis-
ual aid in talks to local or-
ganizations the first year we
were selling the program to
the town.

RECREATION

The program, as it is being conducted now, has
been in operation just three years. Camp is just
coming up. In this period, the budget has grown
from less than $10,000 in 1946 to about $18,000
for 1949. The total registration and attendance
have grown more proportionately with an increase
of over one hundred per cent in both totals in the
three-year period.

The summer program, which is entirely recrea-
tional in nature, is aimed primarily at the youth
of the community. It is financed mainly by the
recreation council, a Community Chest agency,
but the school department provides the director,
the buildings and some money. Other community
agencies, such as the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts
and, for the first time this year, an item included
in the town of VVatertown’s budget labeled recrea-
tion, help financially. Many private citizens and
local industries contribute both materials and
money to help out.

The program offers the use of six playgrounds
and a day camp, and provides teen-age activities,
baseball, basketball, a softball league, and a com-
munity swimming lake.

Another feature is an equipment and program
loan service. Any agencies or individuals needing
recreation equipment are free at any time to bor-
row all sorts of materials on a short-term loan.
Our library of materials and books is also avail-
able to the community and used widely in setting
up recreation programs for all types of age and in-
terest groups.

The long-range planning calls for an expanded
program of recreation during the summer months
for the adults of Watertown. The winter program
is held almost entirely in the public schools, and
is financed principally by the school budget. The
organization chart lists almost all the activities
now being conducted. Added to this are activities
which have started since the first of the year:
ceramics, dramatic club, fly-tying and casting for
fishermen, and hooked rug-making.

Something new in thefield of adult education
was organized last fall—an adult education and
recreation program jointly conducted by the pub-
lic school department and Taft School, a private
preparatory school. The idea was to combine the
faculties and to use facilities of both institutions.

For the hrst time, and in conjunction with this
joint sponsorship of an adult education and recrea-
tion program, we are setting up an adult education
council. As I see it, this council will have three

main functions :,

I. To advise the director of program activities.
2. To advise on means and methods of selling

NOVEMBER 1950

the adult education and recreation program.

3. To help set up and follow through with long-
range planning.

Coming under the duties of the director are two
additional ones which are closely related to the
general field of community organization. One is

the issuing of permits to the public for the use of
all school facilities. The second is the re5ponsi-

bility for the maintenance and upkeep of the play-
grounds and athletic fields in town.

Along with the various duties connected closelv
Wlth adult education and recreation, there also are

many activities going on in the community which
require his assistance. Being closely associated
with the recreation council, all Community Chest
financial drives and affairs must be attended. The
director must also devote time to Red Cross meet-
ings on water safety and first aid, and these take
some time and endeavor. In addition, there are
many other agencies in the community which have
varying degrees of interest in the program and
their needs must be met. I believe that it is only
by satisfying such needs and building up a spirit
of very good c00peration and integration that any
kind of success in this held can be achieved.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS are so important! They
need to be carefully planned because they tell
much, much more than most pe0ple suspect. Of
course, the theatre has always paid serious respect
to their importance, and stage designers have spent
many a long hour working on a set .that, at the
raising of the curtain, will tell just the story they
want it to convey.

Recreation centers should give equally as much
thought to the matter because, with the opening of
the front door, just such a tale is told! It isn’t al-
ways the tale the director likes—but with a little
planning, she can make it a different story!

When the visitor puts his foot inside the front
door, he forms some very definite opinions about
the efficiency of staff in running the building and
about the person who supervises the housekeeping
chores. Dirty woodwork, soiled curtains, scuffed
stairs, finger-marked doors and dusty lights scream
of negligence, laxity and an “I-don’t-care” attitude
on the part of everyone concerned. Maybe there
isn’t enough money—or help—available to do the
job properly, but some directors faced with that
problem have organized bucket brigades, clean-up
squads and Tom Sawyer parties in which center
groups themselves had a gay time scrubbing and

painting. It’s all in the director’s approach, of
course!

By the time his second foot is inside the door,
the visitor should have noticed more than the clean,
attractive front entrance. The bulletin board should
have caught his eye and informed him of all the
exciting events of the week, with special emphasis
on the ones for today and tonight, their time and
location.

The building directory should have pointed out
the path to follow to get to the big event-of—the-
evening or to any of the other activities going on
in the building. How many times have you heard
people say, “A library? I never knew there was
one in the building!” Don’t keep any secrets—let
the building directory tell all it can about what the
place has to offer.

A perfect arrangement would be one in Wthh
the director could meet and greet every person as
he entered. But there’s no such thing as a perfect
arrangement! The next best thing would be to
have a picture of the staff, mayor, junior chairman
or club council conspicuously posted and labeled.
The visitor could then feel more comfortable know-
ing who his host or hostess is!

Needless to say, it won’t do any good to have
all this helpful information and hospitality about if
it can’t be seen! 80 make sure that your recrea-
tion center is brightly illuminated and as pleasing
and attractive as possible.

Make yours a grand entrance, and success is
bound to follow!

RECREATION

HOBBIES

 

Illustrating the wise use of volunteer skill.

An Astronomy Group

Doris Mann Stierli

SOME ADULTS enjoy bowling in their
leisure time; while others find their recre-
ation by donning old clothes and hiking through
the woods. In the communities of Caldwell-West
Caldwell, New Jersey, a group of approximately
thirty men and women finds its pleasure in the
study of astronomy. "

 

This hobby group has built its own telescope,
made a detailed study of star charts, and has
greatly increased its knowledge of this fascinating
field, all within the period of one year. _

You may ask, “How did this recreation activity
come about?” or “What part did the recreation
commission play in establishing such an organi-
zation ?”

The boroughs of Caldwell and West Caldwell
are very fortunate in having a volunteer leader
such as Robert M. Greenley, an optical instrument
maker who has had vast eXperience in the field of
astronomy. At one time he Was a member of an
astronomical society in Teaneck, and has always
visualized such a group in Caldwell. He has also
given astronomy courses in the adult education
program offered by the town’s board of education.
However, Mr. Greenley realized the need for a
carry-over of this activity after the basic course of
instruction was completed. If only this group,
composed of both novice and advanced astrono-
mers, could have a club and meeting place to
continue with their research! And so, with the
assistance of the recreation commission, a “West
Essex Astronomical Society” was born. The com-
mission obtained a high school room where the
club could meet once a month to carry on its

program and now handles all publicity for the club
through the weekly paper.

This self-supporting organization reveals a real
cross-section of the two boroughs. The roster
includes engineers, clergymen, teachers, a movie
projectionist, clerks, mechanics, librarians and
milkmen. The only requirements necessary to be-
come a member are the contribution of an annual
fee of two dollars and a genuine interest in as-
tronomy.

The progress of the club, under the excellent
leadership of Mr. Greenley, has been truly amaz-
ing. Each member has worked on the building of
a telescope—of the mirror-reflector type similar to
telescopes used in Mt. Wilson and Mt. Palomar,
California, observatories—which will serve a dual
purpose of scientific and educational value. Not
only will the society benefit from this telescope,
but it also will be used by the Caldwell schools
for visual-aid demonstration.

The club is primarily an observation group. If
the sky is clear, telescopes are set up and the par-
ticipants become engrossed in watching the many
constellations. There have been as many as four
telescopes in operation at one time. Program is
also provided by eminent amateur astronomers
who speak on subjects associated with the work
they are doing at the time, and films are sometimes
shown of sunspots and allied solar phenomena.

Future plans for the club include an additional
observing night midway between meeting nights,
and an occasional “Star Party” which will be open
to the public. Several telesc0pes will be set up,
with a member who is prepared to answer ques-
tions assigned to each one. The parties should
provide an excellent opportunity to sell the pro—
gram and make more citizens star conscious.

Fun in Moscow

66 HAT DO YOU mean, ‘fun in MoscOw’? I

W thought everything behind the Iron Cur-
tain was . . . ”

Oh, no, I mean Moscow, Idaho, the dry pea
capital of the nation. This is a community of
8,500 citizens, plus University of Idaho students,
which includes funds for public recreation in the
municipal budget, hires a full-time recreation di-
rector and has set up facilities for the leisure-time
betterment of its citizens. So Moscow has another
trophy to hang in the city hall in addition to rib-
bons for cleanliness and the outlawing of flies. A1—
most from the day it stepped into the ranks of a
city in 1883, its recreation-consciousness has been
the envy of people in less progressive communities.
Organized recreation grew with the city through
the years until World War II. A municipal swim—
ming pool, tennis courts and a softball diamond,
as well as the inclusion of adults and pre-school
children in the program, were features of this pe-
riod. However, in the early 1940’s, juvenile delin-
quency and other problems of too-much-leisure-
time increased.

Moscow’s PTA then started the ball rolling to-
ward a bigger and better recreation schedule.
Sparkplugged by it was a community recreation
committee composed of members from each local
service club and the public schools, plus George
Greene and Leon Green of the University of Idaho
Department of Physical Education. This commit-
tee was directed by the city chamber of commerce.

Although not a profem'onal recreation worher, Robert
Forhe: felt that his hometown’: recreation program

To members of that early committee goes much
of the credit for success in the planned fun venture.

Greatest share of credit for the city recreation
program should go to Leon Green, however. It
was largely because of his professional interest that
the Moscow program continued through the last
ten years. He has also been instrumental in stimu-
lating interest in recreation statewide. Recently,
both Weiser and Nampe, Idaho, saw the wisdom
in employing a full-time recreation director, largely
through Green’s efforts.

In 1947, the Moscow City Council voted to make
the recreation committee a permanent body and
allot tax money for its disposal. This budget al-
lowed the employment of a full—time director of
recreation and the help of several part-time or sea-
sonal experts. The head post was filled last June
by Carl Munson, Vandal gridman of 1946 and

Fun in Moscow
(Continued from page 336)

on a more permanent basis with the creation of a
city recreation commission.

The program has been booming in Moscow for
the last three years, being especially active during
the past two summers. In 1949, city recreation
drew the amazing total of 70,000 participation-
hours at a cost to the taxpayer of less than six
cents per hour.

Many townspeople of all ages had fun in the city
recreation park, where baseball games were or-
ganized, the swimming pool was kept busy twelve
hours a day, bicycle races and special events were
held. Among these last were a pet parade, water
carnival, kids’ circus, all-city swim meets, band
concerts in the park, square dances, talent night,
doll day, Indian festivals and day and night soft-
ball and baseball games for all ages. One of the
most popular activities was the weekly scuffle on
the ball diamond between the Half Pints and the
Squirts. Baseball games between Moscow teams
and those of near-by towns went on almost nightly,

under a $3,000 park lighting system made possible
by the chamber of commerce.

The city high school was quiet not one summer
day. Square and folk dancing classes took over the
gymnasium, while. the auditorium resounded to
the tootlings and booms of a daily band concert.
Children nine to twelve years of’age formed a

group which discouraged weeds on the high school '

baseball diamond.

.Small children were not forgotten in the rush
either. They had a special park, with wading pool,
sandpile and swings, in Moscow’s East End.
Here doll days, Indian lore and a rhythm band
were featured. In addition, for two successive
years, Anne Livingston, recreation leadership spe—
cialist of the National Recreation Association, con-

ducted a training school in Moscow and did much
to help the leaders in the city.

A noteworthy development in Moscow’s awak—
ened civic pride and recreation program can be
seen on city streets at Santa Claus time. A com-
munity Christmas tree, greens and lights on every
lamppost, a fir bough canopy over Main Street,
and daily programs of carols were quite an under-
taking for the city. All of the towns close to Mos-
cow also take part in the yuletide programs, which

include a Genesee Day, Potlatch Day, Troy Day
and so on.

\Vinter doesn’t bring an end to the outdoor side
of Moscow’s fun. Skiing instruction has been

338

given on the Robert Peterson farm Just outside of
town. The municipal baseball diamond is Hooded
to make an excellent skating rink; a hilly street in
town is blocked off to provide a safe place for
youngsters and their sleds. A City Recreation
Basketball League has been formed with eight
teams and over one hundred players participating.

A milestone in emphasis on the right kind of
fun in Moscow was passed in October, 1948. At
that time, a new city recreation center was opened
——a full—depth, first-floor room on Main Street in
the middle of the business district. The event drew
a capacity crowd of over five hundred people, who
came to look the place over, enjoy refreshments
and take in an exhibition of square dancing and
eiitertainment.

Munson outlined 'a tentative program for the
center including handcraft nights, community cho-
rus sessions, stamp trading, fly—tying, ping—pong
and checker tournaments, square dances and teen-
agers’ night. The older folks are not to be for—
gotten for an afternoon is to be reserved for them.

Moscow Mayor, R. K. Bonnett, is well—pleased
with the recreation program. He says, “Our small
tax levy has been repaid manifold by more con-
tented children and grownups.”

Dog Training Classes

HE Milwaukee Department of Municipal Rec—

reation, in c00peration with the Wisconsin
Humane Society, conducts a Dog Training School
at one of its social centers during the winter
season.

“There is no such thing as a bad dog,” says
Gustave P. Utke, executive vice-president of the
Wisconsin Humane Society. Recreation leaders
and boys’ club workers have often used a similar
phrase made famous by Father Flanagan, founder
of Boys’ Town, who stated: “There is no such
thing as a bad boy.” Canine delinquency can be
blamed on the owners of dogs. With proper treat-
ment and instruction, any dog can ‘be trained in
good manners and obedience. On this premise,
the Wisconsin Humane Society started an educa—
tional program for dog owners. The great value
of this program for children is that it teaches them
the proper relationship between themselves and
their pets.

The animal welfare director of the society con-
ducts the recreation department course of ten les-
sons for ten weeks for children from ten to sixteen
years of age. Dogs from eight months to three
years of age are admitted for training. At the
close of the ten-week period, certificates are issued
to those who have completed the course satis-
factorily.

Children and dogs are taught to work together
during the course, which includes the following
training sessions:

(1) Lecture on dog care and training. This
covers such points as patience, clear, firm com-
” mands, sharp corrections, length of time to work
dogs, food, cleaning, and so forth. (2) Demonstra-
-tion of commands. Heel, down, stay, come, sit.
(3) Lesson on command to sit, working individ-
ually with class. (4) Lesson on command of sit
and heel. (5) Lesson on command of down. (6)
Lesson on command of stay. (7) Lesson on com-

mand of stand. (8) Lesson on command of recall I

or come. (9) Review of all commands for final
tests. (10) Graduation day.

The graduation program is a test of the child’s
ability to handle his dog. Judges are selected
from the Milwaukee Dog Training Club, and chil-
dren and dogs are graded as they “strut their
stuff.” Trophies donated by service clubs and the

Dog Training Society are awarded to the best per-
formers. :

City Ski School

Moms Syracusans have been learning ski funda-
mentals at their free Ski School since the old
concept of a winter program as being almost ex-
clusively indoors was destroyed with the establish-
ment. Iof sectional skiing instruction in the city’s
T hornden, Schiller, Onondaga and Burnet parks.
This school has not been limited to youngsters";
particularly significant is the adult interest in
Saturday skiing instruction. In all, 545 adults were
taught skiing fundamentals, many of them in after-
noon classes reserved for grownups.

The Ski School was approved by the United
States Eastern Amateur Ski Association to issue
fourth-class proficiency awards after the required
tests. All instruction has been based on the New
York State Unified Technique, taught by eight
instructors selected from the Syracuse University
ski school staff. Two ends have been accomplished
by using this system. Since all instructors teach
the same technique of skiing, a person can continue
receiving instruction in any of the areas, without
repetition or interruption in training, simply by
notifying the new instructor of his progress at the
previous area. Secondly, the emphasis has been on
safe, enjoyable skiing fundamentals.

sion, Syracuse, New York.

‘ Family Fun Book

Published by the publishers of Parents’ Magazine.
.Order from Subscription Department, Parents’
Institute,,Bergenfield, New Jersey. $1.00.

HERE is a gay little book to keep in a handy

place where all the family can use it! Like a
good cook book, all the fun recipes have been tried
and tested, and they all work!

Have you a “play tyrant” in your home? A
child who demands attention every minute of the
-day? Teach him, through play, to be self-reliant
in his amusements before he’s five and he’ll never
grow into a restless, bored adult. The chapter
“Help Your Child To Entertain Himself” is a
wise, interesting account of how a small boy, John,
was led into good play habits from the time he was
less than a year old.

Do you worry over your teen-agers being out
so many evenings? There’s a chapter called “Nine
Easy Homemade Parties,” all tried successfully
with teen-age children.

When your child is ill or recovering from an
illness, do you know little, inexpensive ways to
keep him amused? Do you know what kinds of
toys to select for a three-year-old? Or what toys to
take on vacation or on an automobile trip? Best
of all, do you know how to use your imagination in
devising play equipment out of odds and ends?
Have you ever thought about using an old pump,
a butter-churn, a food chopper, an old mattress, a
tire pump or a pulley as fascinating play equip-
ment? Read that chapter and learn how.

Are you good company to your children on pic-

nics? Do you use the four seasons to give your“

child an appreciation of nature and the out-of-
doors?

All these, plus lots, lots more, are packed into
these 158 pages—all so simple, and so practical!
And such fun to read! You’ll want to sit right
down and try out some of these ideas. All they
need is imagination and willingness—no expensive
gadgets, no elaborate toys and games—just homey.
everyday things that will give pleasure to all the
family, and a new zest to family living l—Virgz'nia

Communities for Better Living

James Dahir. Harper and Brothers, New York.
$4.00.

THIS should interest everyone in the recreation
field as well as others who work in community

organization. It contains a great many examples
of community planning, with emphasis on the so-
cial aspects of it, from various local projects to
whole communities which have been built from
scratch. Mr. Dahir’s descriptions of the various
movements and theories concerned with com-
munity planning—such as the Greenbelt towns, the
Peckham Experiment and others—are exceedingly
interesting and valuable. Another important fea-
ture is the good bibliography with which the book
ends—Arthur Todd, District Representative, Na-
tional Recreation Association.

The Age of Indiscretion

Clyde Brion Davis. J. B. Lippincott Company,
New York. $3.00.

THE AGE OF INDISCRETION is not a recreation
book, but its application to recreation work
makes it of interest to all the people in the field. It
tells of the “good old days,” at the same time point-
ing out that the present ones are better and, that
contrary to many ways of thinking, culture has not
declined. Much of the theme is based upon the
town of Chillicothe, Missouri, fifty years ago and
now.

An antidote to such books as I Remember Ma.—
ma and Chicken Every Sunday, it is written in a
genial, humorous style which makes it particularly

readable—Arthur Todd.

From Native Roots

Felix Sper. The Caxton Printers, Limited, Cald-
well, Idaho. $4.00.

DR SPER’S survey of the growth of American
drama from the pageant to local legend play
should serve as an inspiration to all directors of
community theaters. Dividing the country into
thirteen units, the study covers the dramatic re-
sources of each section, explaining how dramatic
literature springs from the social and economic
backgrounds of the citizenry. The works of all our

343

major regional dramatists are explained, and an
excellent bibliography makes possible further study
of this all-important “grass roots” development of
the American theater.

From Native Roots should encourage all stu-
dents of dramaturgy to seek out local legends,
customs and history for their future plays. There
is still a vast reservoir of material lying untapped
for the ambitious playwright and pageant-maker—
and from this source alone will spring the true
national theater.-——Loraine l-li’illiams, Correspond—

fare, Columbus, Ohio. $1.00.

THIS STUDY of sixty-seven clubs for the older
adult in Ohio contains much information and
comment of value to anyone planning to start rec-
reation activities for this group or wishing to ex-
tend or improve existing club services. It covers
all phases of the question, including demand, par-
ticipation, age range, facilities, leadership, finance,
program, membership participation and the type of
older peOple interested in the club activities.

special pictures of a ship, a clown, a Halloween
witch, the cow jumping over the moon and the
others. There are a few words I can’t understand
so I’m learning words I never knew. But I don’t
mind learning if it’s fun,“ too.”

These crossword puzzles are especially designed
for bOys and girls between the ages of nine to
fourteen. ' There are'easy ones in the front of the
book for beginners, slightly more advanced ones
next'iti fine and real puzzlers at the end.

Play-iu-Bed Fun is fine tonic for the young
child who must stay put, but any five-to-eight-
year-old who wants to be entertained when there’s
no one with whom to play will also be delighted
with it. This book is crammed full of gay story-
games, coloring and drawing fun, picture quizzes
and loads of other ideas which help make the hours
fly by. All directions are predicated on a very
limited reading knowledge so that the boy or girl
who is fairly new at reading can enjoy each page
without the aid of a parent or teacher.

Eighty Play Ideas for Little Children offers
fascinating play suggestions for the toddlers—four
to seven years of age. There are over one hundred
illustrations with suggestions for self-play, simple
games, gifts tots can make, games for quiet hours
and small space. The materials used for construct-

-ing an art gallery, a “ball” for a special game, a

giddyap horse and the many other objects to be
created for play and re-play are safe, easy to
handle, cost practically nothing and are usually
found in most homes.

Of course, the children in this age group will
have to depend on parents or teachers to read the
games or play ideas to them. For this reason, the
book is written as if it were addressed to the child
himself so that he will feel that he is actually
directing his own play.
