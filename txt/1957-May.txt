of the free throw circles. Hillyard has developed a new Lining Template
which makes it easy for you to lay out perfect free throw circles

as required by the new official rules.

Without this handy tool, it’s next to impossible to compute exact disrances
around the circle for the line and space segments of the d0tted lines.

Charles F. Weekwerth

Ely Philosophy

of Recreation

E iINCE THE TURN of the century, recreation has been offered and provided by many
public and private agencies to meet the daily needs of our average population.
Today, such service is ever increasing, and is being provided for our handicapped, ‘

as Well.
One of the landmarks in the growth of recreation services to all people was the

1946 Los Angeles survey, Recreation for Everybody. This survey recommended the
following four basic principles upon which opportunities and services for recreation
could be established: people desire and need places to go for their recreation; people
need and wish a program of activities in which to participate; people need and gravitate to a variety of
group relationships while engaging in recreation; and people who are handicapped desire and need rec-
reation opportunities and services. .

What does recreation mean to the average person of any community? What does the behavior of
each of the following persons indicate regarding the meaning of recreation to him: a businessman in his
fifties; a youngster in his teens; an oldster in the seventies; professional persons, such as a doctor, a

 

_lawyer, a teacher, a librarian? What about the .ehorus girl, the person in military uniform 011 first liberty

or leave, the young wife with no children, an older woman with many children, a steel worker?

What do the experts say about the meaning of recreation? There appear, among many views, to be
at least five schools of thought: recreation is a matter of attitudes; recreation is a matter of activities; rec-
reation is a matter of experience—~51 way of life; recreation is a matter of land areas, buildings, facilities
and equipment; recreation is a field of professional leadership.

Recreation as attitude reveals such views as physical fitness for military needs or for one’s cultural
development. Recreation as attitude would include religious dogma and doctrine as illustrated in America
by the hlue laws of Puritanism.

Recreation as activity is perhaps our most common view, and includes those activities which we en-
joy in our leisure time—physical, mental, cultural, active or passive, in groups or as individuals.

Recreation as experience is perhaps the most basic or valid conception since both attitude and activ-
ity produce experience. Experience reveals recreation as being an individual and essential human need.
Recreation as experience results in a variety of forms of human eXpression yielding individual and
social values.

Recreation as the provision of land areas, jacilitics and entertainment is too often a conscious goal of
agencies and their members, civil services and the taXpayers. in essence, such locations should provide
opportunities and show concern for community recreation. Profit motive provides recreation services.
resulting in “commercial recreation” as one of the forms of community recreation. Community recrea-
tion, then, in essence, includes many persons, places and purposes and, as such, becomes a collective
matter.

It is evident that recreation as a broad concept, has a meaning which includes each and all of these
schools of thought. Basically, it is a human need. Recreation, to different persons, is most often an ab-
straction like many of the other common words in our vocabulary—education, love, brotherhood, reli-
gion, happiness, satisfaction, and it represents both individual and diverse meanings. It includes a rich
variety of activity forms, ranging from athletics and sports on one extreme, through cultural activities
on the other. It is a basic social attitude, and through activity yields personal satisfaction, relaxation.
and the renewal of spirit. Professional leadership, in addition to location, facilities and equipment, must
he provided so that opportunities and services for recreation experience and eXpression becomes possible.

In brief, recreation is an individual matter of experience determined by choice in one’s behavior, not
in words. It belongs to no one organization, public or private, hut rather to all organizations concerned
with the value of experience of, for, and by people. All peeple need and want it. Recreation can be an im-
portant means, as well as an important and necessary end, in and for human experience and expression. I

BUILT LIKE AN AIRPLANE WING—
Aircraft structural design combined
with spring-leaf principle and heat-
tempered, specially alloyed aluminum
are joined in an assembly of great
strength, uniform flexibility and
incomparable springing qualities.

PRACTICALLY UNBREAKABLE — Many
times stronger than actual load re-
quirements—will Withstand severest
use day after day, yet continue to
give unmatched performance and
maximum springing action year after
year, free of repairs or replacement.

SPRING-LEAF CONSTRUCTION gives
much greater strength at fulcrum
where needed, and lightness at tip.

Price of Camping Maps

Sirs:

Thank you for mentioning our book
Camping Maps USA in the March issue.
We have had quite a number of inquir-
ies regarding the price and wonder if
you would be kind enough to list this as
$1.95, postpaid.

Foc of Delinquency

Sirs:

Your provocative article, “Family
Recreation —- Foe of Juvenile Delins
queney” (February issue), shows very
clearly the necessity for close familylife
to reduce juvenile delinquency. Family
life is our hrst school, upon which our
future life depends so much.

I have felt that “we” feeling of close
family life, and I can tell how wonderful
it is to enjoy our parents, learn from
them. and feel that great allection and
emotional security that produces close
family ties.

Your article made me realize that we
must work together for the achievement
of this noble purpose—family unity.

LUCRECIA PIZARRO, College of Saint
Teresa, Winona, Minnesota.

Adolescence

Sirs:

I am most enthusiastic about the
article in your February issue by Miss
Helen Rapp (“Adolescence Will Be
Like This,” pages 41 and 4-2) . May we
have permission to reprint parts of this
article in The Camp Fire Girl maga-
zine? I think Miss Rapp’s essay is one
of the most readable I have ever read
on this subject. She has such a nice con-
versational style and I think her words
would be helpful to our Horizon Club
advisors.

I appreciate receiving the page from

ing well received throughout the nation

terial is now in its third printing.
Again, thanks for mentioning it and
congratulations to you on RECREATon
-—-it is a splendid magazine and we all
look to it for continued expressions 0

' junior Gardeners . . . . . . . . . . . Ann Albert

The month of May, with its fragrance of flowers and thoughts of grow-
ing things, is a good time for awakening interest in a gardeners” club.

AJUNIOR GARDENER CLUB has been active in Santa Ana,

California, for more than five years, because a commu-
nity-minded citizen, Mrs. Weston Walker, past president of
California Garden Clubs, came to the recreation department
with the idea.

The group meets once a month at the community center
clubhouse, and has an average of thirty-three youngsters
and eight parents at each meeting. It is co-sponsored by the
Santa Ana Recreation Department, the Year ’Round Garden
Club and the Santa Ana Garden Section of the Ebell Club.
The department piovides a meeting place, the necessary
paper work, help with publicity, and the active interest of
a recreation staff member. Meetings are planned and con-
ducted by counselors who are women interested in gardening
and children, and who often are garden club members.

Many subjects in the gardening and nature field have
been covered by these children at their meetings. They have
learned about Luther Burbank, Johnny Appleseed, Audubon
and other famous naturalists; spring, SUmmer and fall bulbs
and how to grow them; how to start 'plants from cuttings;
how to grow from seed; how to mix soil and make compost;
how to recognize and control pests; how to weed and water
correctly; how to mulch to conserve water; how to plant to
' control erosion. They have learned how to arrange flowers
and foliage, dry weeds, fruits and vegetables; how to plant
dish-gardens. They have learned about birds and wild
flowers, forestry and conservation, state and national parks.

During handcraft periods—a part of every meeting—they
have made ceramics, Christmas ornaments and party favors,
woven mats of eucalyptus bark, decorated flowerpots, made
gardening scrapbooks, leis, corsages. They have had the
thrill of appearing on television, entering the Orange County
Fair and other flower shows.

In the field of community service these young people have
beautified two city lots with lovely flower plots and have
raised vegetables. They have furnished many fresh-flower
bouquets for the children’s wards of the county hospital
and presented planters to children in the tuberculosis ward,
planted trees for Arbor Day, provided fresh flowers for the
tables in a school cafeteria. Each year they undertake a
different scrapbook project, having studied -trees one year,
birds the next, and they are currently working on insect
and bug books.

Organizing a junior club is really very simple. One or
more leaders meet with five or more children, explaining the
sort of fun they will be having and the fascinating things
they will learn. A name should be selected at one of the
first meetings. Some clubs meet weekly, some every two
weeks and some once a month. Members should elect of-
ficers and decide whether to have dues. Most clubs of this

sort, the Santa Ana Club included, do not have any.

Record keeping is important. There may be calls for sta-
tistical information, clippings and snapshots of civic proj-
ects, newspaper publicity and other data. If the children are
not old enough to accept this responsibility, it should be
done by the adult leader or an assistant.

Club members may be affiliated with the Audubon Junior
Club, by payment of twenty-five cents each and receive bird
membership pins. (Write National Audubon Society, 654
North Durfee Avenue, El Monte, California, for details.)
Most clubs ad0pt the Junior Gardeners’ Pledge.

Programs vary from club to club but usually include the
aforementioned activities. There might also be talks by out-
side speakers, short talks on the flower or bird of the month,
and chances for members to tell of interesting plants seen on
a trip, a beautiful garden visited, and to show blooms from
their own gardens and shell or rock collections. Often there
is distribution of plant material to members at the close of
meetings, something to take home and plant—perhaps excess
from gardens of adult leaders, garden club members, or
nurserymen who will donate flats of unsold bedding plants
or bulbs. Program planning help is available, too, from your
state junior gardening chairman, your local library, nurser-
ies, farm advisor’s oflice, 4-H office, Audubon club, and for-
estry department.

The children in our garden clubs are the future better
citizens of our country—the ones who will realize the im-
portance of conservation, who will maintain their homes and
grounds, who will respect our public parks, forests and road-
sides. Even as youngsters they will have higher morals, for
outdoor life and juvenile delinquency seldom mix. I

IN MINNESOTA a governor’s council on youth recently pro-
posed that communities prepare and adopt advisory
guides for conduct. Acting On this proposal, a special com-
mittee of adults and young persons, sponsored by the Wom-
en’s Institute of St. Paul, developed a “Social Code” for the
guidance of parents and their teenfage youngsters?" One Of
the interesting points in the code is that parents have an
obligation to assist in community projects for young people.
Throughout, the obligations of teen-agers and parents to
each other are clearly defined, and the need for cooperation
and sharing of responsibilities is emphasized. The code,
which appears here in its entirety, has been distributed to
schools, parent-teacher groups, and student council bodies in
St. Paul and vicinity. Meanwhile, other Minnesota commu-
nities are responding to the challenge. Teen-agers are as en-
thusiastic as are the adults—-—the conduct code works!

Pick Up Your Sketch 300k

Norman Garbo

Spring weather is here, and now “you can get out
of the house!” On hikes and picnics slip a pad
and pencil into your pocket for that quick sketch
which can catch a mood or presecve a memory.

THE TIME is ripe to try and revive a

greater interest in one of art’s sim-
plest and most fundamental tools—the
lead pencil. Because of the beauty and
glamour in oil painting, a great many
beginners and amateur artists have
never worked .with a pencil at all.
Although the pencil can hardly compete
with oils as a medium of artistic expres-
sion, it nevertherless offers some ad-
vantages that certainly shouldn’t be
ignored. Let’s look at a few:

1. It’s darn cheap.

2. It will lend itself just as well to a
quick sketch as to a finished drawing.
Most artists are aware of the pencil’s
use for a quick preliminary drawing,
but few havc fully eXplored its great
potential as an attractive medium in
itself.

3. It’s always accessible and easily
carried. As long as you own a pocket,
the pencil can be ever handy.

4. It can be corrected and erased
with a minimum of trouble.

5. It can be used with speed when
speed is necessary, or can be adapted to
great detail and texture.

6. All of us are familiar with the
pencil, so that it feels quite comfortable
and natural when we hold it.

7. It’s not messy to work with, and
the drawings, when completed, require
no special care for preservation.

8. It will readily respond to almost
any demand. If you need a fine line, a
sharp point will produce it. If you want
the soft touch for a mass of shading, a
blunt edge may be used almost like a
brush. It will also produce any tone
from light to dark.

§ § § §

One of the most popular misconcep-
tions floating about is the idea that all
still life is limited to indoor possessions.

This was brought home to me most
strikingly when I stopped to see a friend
who had but recently heard the “call to
art.”

It was a beautiful spring Sunday
afternoon and I found him in a gloomy
basement studio, painting some tired
looking grapes and apples. Taking him
by the horns I whisked him into his
sunny back yard and expounded a few

personal theories on artists and the out- .

doors; to wit:

First, we should take advantage of all
good spring, summer and fall weather
by working outdoors whenever possible.
A paintbrush, somc sunshine and a few

gulps of fresh air can make a pretty 1

enjoyable combination.

Second, if you are still limiting your-
self to still life as subject matter, there
exists a superabundance of material in

“outdoor still life.” We have only to I

know what to look for and we will find it
all about us.

Incidentally, please don’t confuse
“outdoor still life” with a few objects
from indoors set up outdoors. The term
“outdoor still life” refers specifically to
those objects normally found outdoors,
such as, a rural mailbox in its natural
setting, a bird house with some ivy cn-
twincd about it, an interesting corner of
a chimney and a slanting roof, a few
garden tools and gloves lying on the
ground, a rain barrel standing beneath
a drain pipe, any piece oflawn furniture
that strikes your fancy, an especially
picturesque fence; or, if you’re near the
water, all sorts of fishing gear, for ex-
ample, lobster pots, oars, nets and boat-
hooks.

Bear in mind that all of these objects
represent the main theme of your com-
position. They should, therefore, be in
the central foreground and drawn large

RECREATION I

enough so they are given importance.
Figures 1 and 3 are examples of how
some of these things may be treated.

At this point you’re probably quite
eager to try a full-fledged landscape
drawing. Perhaps you’ve already sneak-
ed in a few attempts with good, bad or
indifferent results. In any case, let’s take
a look at things from the grass up.

One of the most exciting, yet confus-
ing and frustrating days in the life of
the art student is “life day.” This is the
day when you, as an embryonic Rem-
brandt, gather up pad, pencils and, of
course, eraser, and venture forth to
draw nature where it lives.

Whether you travel fifty yards or fifty
miles from your hearth, your first reac-
tion is bound to be the same. You look
about you in awe at the seemingly end-
less expanse of land and sky and mur-
mur respectively, “Lord, it’s a mighty
large thing you’ve created here.”

After that profound statement you
proceed to draw, on a twelve-by-sixteen-
inch sheet of paper, everything you can
see within a radius of twenty miles.

After a few hours of wading through a
swamp of confusion, you look at the
mess on your pad and decide you should
have stuck to golf.

Believe me, you’re doing things the
hard way. Drawing can be relaxing as
well as fun, but not like this. You can’t
fight this thing because, as you see, it’s
bigger than you; so take a few hints
from an “old pro”:

1. Set yourself up in the shade. The
shadow of a tree, a barn, a building or
a hill will do. If you’re going to be dif-
ficult and insist upon drawing with no
visible shade, turn your pad with its
back to the sun. Sunlight playing across
your working surface will only distort
your tones and give you a headache.

2. Cut out in advance and take with

by three inches in size.

3. Close one eye, and holding the
cardboard cutout before the other eye,
circle slowly about until you see, framed
within the opening, the composition you
would like to draw. It will appear
through the cardboard frame as in Fig-

ure 2, delimiting the area for you.

4. Be most careful of the composition
you choose. The temptation will be
great, but don’t try to draw everything
in sight.

Choose one main object in the fore-
ground as your center of interest—a
tree, a rock or a shrub. Place it off cen-
ter on your pad and fill in with a back-
ground of clouds, hills, a body of water.

In Figure 1 I’ve chosen a tree silhou-
etted against the sky. I’ve made every-
thing in the foreground dark for empha-
sis, which is something to bear in mind.
Always try to exaggerate darks and
lights, particularly when working in
black and white.

In drawing from nature, remember to
avoid very straight, ruled-looking lines.
Not only is it completely unnecessary
to draw a straight line to create a work
of art, but it is important that you do
not do so. Regularity has always been
the keynote of man-made objects, while
nature in any form is typified by irregu-
larity. No two things that God has cre-
ated have ever been exactly the same. I

Teaching Baseball to Beginners

E ACH LEAGUE has a new crop of beginners every spring,
and a special teaching program is desirable for them.
This is particularly true for the youngsters who have had lit-
tle or no opportunity to play baseball, or who have not de-
veloped sufficiently to participate in a program with older,
more experienced players.

Extensive experiments with youngsters in this category
-——3mostly nine- and ten-year olds—has led us to believe that
the best way to instruct and develop them is through a pro-
gram of teaching through game participation. '

Depending on the number of boys, they are divided into
squads of about fourteen to eighteen players each. The play-
er agent can balance the squads after several tryout sessions,
and then regular games can be scheduled; but no effort
should be made to keep standings, averages or records.

short, so drills should be varied and brief. Start each ses-
sion with a brief talk and demonstration of some funda-
mental of play—base-running, sliding, proper running form,
coaches directing base-runners, bunting, batting, tagging
runners, the stretch from the base on a force-out play, back-
ing up plays, cutoffs, fielding the ground ball, catching Hies,
throwing double plays, rundown plays, and so on.

Fielding Workouts

After this demonstration, the two teams scheduled to play
then play catch until their arms are warmed up; after which,
the visiting players go to their defensive positions. Start off
by tossing a fly ball and a ground ball to each outfielder and
have the fielders throw to the second baseman. For the first
two or three weeks throw from the vicinity of second base,
then from the pitcher’s mound and finally from homeplate
as their fielding improves.

Next toss a ground ball to each infielder and have each
throw.to the first baseman, with the first baseman throwing
to the shortstop at second base when it is his turn to field a
grounder. Roll the ball to the pitcher to field and throw to
first and then roll the ball in front of the catcher for him to
field and throw to first. Give each player two fielding
chances.

As with the outfielders, toss the ball to the infielders dur-
ing the first two or three weeks and then begin to bat fun-
goes to them as they show improvement. Be sure all your
players can catch fly and ground balls before you hat the
ball to them. You can build their confidence by making the
chances easy for them—you risk injury when you rush them
too fast.

Then have the home team take its fielding drill.. (As the
players become more proficient in fielding, you can alter-
nate double-play drills, cutoff plays, and defensive plays
against bunts and situation drills from game to game.)

When the home team has completed its fielding drill, it
goes in to bat while the visiting team goes into the field.
In the batting drill, each player attempts to bUnt twice and
-takes two swings, batting in the regular order with an adult
serving as pitcher and throwing at half spccd.

After each player has batted, the teams switch, with the
home team moving into the field and the visiting team taking
batting practice. Then a game is played with the batters hit-
ting off a batting tee, set in front of home plate, for two in-
nings. The home team stays in the field as the game begins
with its pitcher on the mound to field that territory even
though he doesn’t pitch the ball.

In playing off the batting tee, the batter must hit the ball
as far as the pitcher’s mound for it to be called a fair ball.
Batted balls which don’t travcl that far in fair tcrritory are
counted as fouls. If a boy swings and misses three times, or
hits two fouls and then misses on a third swing he is out.

Base-runners are retired in the same manner as in regu-
lar Little League Baseball. When' batter and base-runners
have advanced as far as possible without being put out, or
have been retired, the umpire calls “time out” and the ball is
thrown in to the catcher, who places it on the tee. As soon
as all players are in their regular positions, the umpire
calls “time in,” and the next batter takes his turn. Base-
runners must stay on their bases until the ball is batted o
the tee. If each team has as many as eleven players present
two extra boys can be used on each side, one playing in the
outfield behind third base and the other in the outfield be-
hind first base. Instead of using three outs to determine a
half inning, the team stays at bat until all of the eleven
players have batted. All of the extra players should be given
a chance to play during the second inning.

At the conclusion of these two innings, one inning is
played with the pitcher pitching to the batters. Again the
half inning is concluded when all the players on the visiting
team have batted around. (If the team has more than eleven
players the extra players are given a chance to bat, too. If
there are more players on one squad than the other at that
game, the extra players are permitted to bat although any
runs scored as a result of their being at bat do not count in
the score of the game. This is done to give all the players
experience in facing pitchers, without penalizing the teams
because they don’t have the same number of players pres-
ent.) The home team takes its turn at bat against the reg-
ular pitcher even though it is ahead at the end of three and a

half innings and it remains at bat until each player has
batted once. I

Do not hesitate to halt a game, when a boy makes a mis-
take to explain what he should have done in that situation.
'Announce to the boys that they are all learning, that they will
face new situations frequently, and that you will hold up
play to show them the proper way to make a play when some-
thing new develops. If this is done in a friendly way, with-
out criticism of a player who may have made a mistake, you
should be able to do a constructive job of teaching at a tirnc
when it makes an impression on the players.

Precaution should be taken to teach the boys to hit with-
out throwing their bats. Beginners have a tendency to let
the bat fly after hitting the ball, and injuries are invited by
this procedure. Start by teaching the boy to complete his
swing and drop his bat beside him before running. You
may have to let a boy sit out a game occasionally to get
him to stop this tossing habit.

Another danger can be avoided by having your catchcr
take up his position an arm’s length behind the batter, and
then stretching a tape or string on the ground to remind him
to stay that far back until the batter swings. Othcrwisc some
eager young catcher may be hit with a swinging bat.

Since the interest span of these youngsters is so short.
it seems dcsirablc from a standpoint of safety, as well as
development, that “minor league” practice sessions and
games have a time limit. Experience indicates thcsc ses-
sions should not exceed two hours.

We are tonvinced the boys improve faster and have more
fun doing so under this program. I

PREPARATION FOR A CONVENTION: Be-
come familiar with all preconvention
literature, particularly the agenda.
Study the maps of the area, especially
the location of the rooms in which your
meetings are scheduled.

Ask your local group what they want
you to bring back to them, as well as
what they expect you to take with you.

Many convention-goers make dates
well ahead of the opening. It will be
hard to track down individuals once you
get there.

The more time and thought you put
into preconference planning, the freer
and more efiicient you will be once you
arrive on the scene.——From How to At-

Fences

o Bayside, Wisconsin, has adopted an ordinance requiring
the fencing of private swimming pools within the village.

0 In Los Angeles, California, a new municipal law requires
every body of water more than eighteen inches deep, includ-
ing swimming pools, wading pools, fish ponds or lakes and
ponds on private and industrial property to be enclosed by
a fence at least four and a half feet high. The city council
adopted the law after the drownings of several children in
the last two years. Failure to comply with this law is a mis-
demeanor and carries a maximum fine of $500 and a six-
month jail sentence.

Cutting Corners

0 The May, 1956 issue of the Tennessee Division of State
Parks Newsletter, tells of a “cheap” swimming pool in a
Midwestern city, which turned out to be a poor investment.
No tax money was used in building the pool, as labor and
materials were donated by local residents; so state health
department approval of the plan was neither sought nor re-
quired by law. Once the pool was in operation, however,
the state health department was obliged to assume super-
vision. The very first test revealed that, because of improp-
er design, the pool could not be operated safely, and bac-
teria in the first two water samples taken were too numerous
to count. This experience illustrates the folly of cutting
corners in planning and constructing a facility, such as a
swimming pool, where health and safety are involved.

0 Another recent account of a community which built,
largely with the use of volunteer labor and materials, a
blacktop fill-and-draw type pool, raises questions as to the
wisdom of this type of installation. '

Random Notes

0 In Grants Pass, Oregon, the usefulness of an outdoor
pool has been considerably extended and the unit cost of
operation appreciably reduced through a-eooperative ar-
rangement with local schools. The pool is open from May
first to October first or later, and during the period the

schools are in session it is used regularly by the schools;

which meet the full cost of operation during this time. It

when the schools are not in session.

0 The renting of caps to individuals using the municipal
swimming pool has proved profitable in Klamath Falls,
Oregon. One hundred dollars worth of caps are rented at
ten cents per use and have yielded a profit of approximately
$1,200 a season. Caps are not rented in most pools around
the country.

0 The first instance of a fan- or wedge-shaped indoor pool
that has come to our attention is in Ephraim, Utah, and is
thirty feet to fifty feet by seventy-five feet.

Sandsifter is a Boon

Successful operation of a new type of beach sandsifter
by the Chicago Park District has led to a recommendation
to purchase a second machine of this type, according to the l
American Public Works Association.

Basically, the device is a revolving drum, eight feet wide.
housed under an eneasing metal eover. As it is dragged
over a beach by a gas-powered tractor, scoops on the outer
circumference of the drum dig into the sand to a depth of
five inches. The scooped-up sand is tossed onto vibrating 1

screens with a one-half-ineh mesh and sifted back onto the
beach, while debris moves along into two metal baskets

hauling the machine has a bucket on its front end for pick-
ing up the dumped debris, which is then emptied into a
truck for removal.

Formerly, beach clcan-up in Chicago was done by crews of
men with rakes. To operate the new power-driven outfit.
three men are needed, one to drive the tractor, the others to
handle the baskets at the rear. Although exact figures were
not .available, there is a considerable saving in manpower

Staff Responsibilities

The success of any recreation program depends upon the
high caliber of its staff. Swimming, a major factor in most
recreation programs, is no exception. Consequently, the
most valuable asset on pool or waterfront is a good life-
guard staff.

It is unfortunate that cartoonists have lampooned guards
to such a degree that the public has a tendency to think of
them as beautiful hunks of men with no particular duties.
Such is not the case, however. A lifeguard is on duty for
the express purpose of protecting bathers and maintaining
order. The importance of pre-service lifeguard training can-

not be over-emphasized.

RECREATION

a a
tummy 770054;
Compiled by George Butler

Basic requirements for a lifeguard are:
1. Successful completion of a recognized life-saving
course.

2. Satisfactory completion of an accredited first-aid
course.

3. Good physical condition, a sense of responsibility and
mental alertness. '

The primary duties of the lifeguard are:

1. Standing watch or patrolling.

2. Giving aid to a bather in distress and the immediate
administration of first aid when necessary.

3. Restricting swimmers to the boundary line of the
swimming area.

4». Warning bathers of unseen hazards.

5. Daily inspection of life-saving equipment and effect-
mg necessary repairs. ‘

6. Maintaining order and enforcing established rules.

When patrolling or standing watch, a lifeguard must not
permit his eyes to be diverted from the water. A child could
drown in the length of time it takes to answer a question. A
good lifeguard can handle many interruptions without turn-
ing his eyes from the water. Once a guard has been as-
signedhis post he should leave it only to effect a rescue.
Even then, he should by some prearranged signal notify
other guards that his area will be unsupervised.

Since it is the duty of the lifeguard to prevent an incident
as well as correct it, establishment of boundary lines for the
swimming area on waterfronts other than pools is essential.
This enables the guard to keep all bathers under constant
surveillance and within easy reach in event of an emergency.
N 0 one, regardless of swimming ability, should be permitted
to swim beyond the lines.

It is also the lifeguard’s duty to warn all swimmers of
unforeseen hazards. Many times even a good swimmer will
become panicky should he step into a drop-off or get caught
in a sub-surface current.

A good lifeguard assumes personal responsibility for
everyone. He is constantly alert. He protects the bathers,
not only from possible hazards of the water, but from them-
selves and each other. He practices life-saving skills regu-
larly. He develops a pattern of teamwork with the other
guards and lives up to his duties and responsibilities.

These factors make for good preventive lifeguarding and
help to eliminate the need for unnecessary lifesaving. It’s
a good lifeguard who makes the difference.——]ohn W. Mac-
Enroe, Recreation Consultant, New York State Youth Com-
mission, in Swimming Pool Age, M ay 1956.

Elimination of Tax

At a recent hearing before the Subcommittee on Excise

MAY 1957

Taxes of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Irving
J. Rotkin, acting chairman of the Community Pools Asso-
ciation of Montgomery County, Maryland, strongly urged
elimination of a twenty per cent tax now imposed on the
initiation fees and annual dues of nonprofit community
swimming pools.

Pointing out that these voluntary community groups were,
in fact, carrying out a desperately needed function usually
undertaken by government agencies, he asked for removal
of what has proven to be a harsh burden upon citizens of
moderate means. This was stated to be necessary to enable
construction of even more community pools throughout the
mushrooming suburban areas.

The demonstrated benefit to the community, on every
level, was declared to be immeasurable in the area of whole-
some family recreation and as “providing a healthy and con-
structive outlet for youthful energies during the summer
months while away from the guidance and restraints of
school (a most important factor in the juvenile delinquency
problem).”

Mr. Rotkin stated, “Here is one of the all too rare instances
where a group of citizens, having recognized a community
need, did not raise a clamor for state or federal funds.
On the contrary, they have and will continue to employ self-
help in a truly democratic fashion.” All that was asked was
the removal of a punitive roadblock which served to hamper
and discourage activity.

Tulsa Swim Suit Campaign

This annual campaign, conducted for years, concerns the
collection of old, outmoded, outgrown suits for distribution
to children unable to buy suits for themselves. Mrs. Harry
Rankin, president of the Hillcrest Medical Center Women’s
Auxiliary in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in charge of the campaign,
writes: “Our radio station announces the campaign several
times a day for three weeks preceding July 4». The slogan
is ‘Make a child happy for the Fourth of July.’ Our large
downtown stores, as well as outlying stores, place boxes in
their lobbies or by the elevator for collection of the suits.

 

This bathhouse of modern design serves sixth outdoor
municipal swimming pool in Oakland, California.
The pool was put in operation in the spring of 1954.

A member of park department picks them up, and they are
distributed to the various city parks. One of our largest laun-
dries renovated the suits for years and is still willing to do
so, but our park department has taken this over for the past
few years. Publicity stresses the fact that having a suit of
his own to use at the pool keeps a child from the old ‘swim-
min’ hole’ where there is so much danger of losing his life
or becoming ill from contaminated waters. Also, a child
with his own suit can join the recreation program offered

by the park department.” I

Twenty-eight underwater lights, plus
overhead lights and incandescent Hoods,
make night swimming a real pleasure.

IT IS USUALLY true in municipal recrea-

’ according to R. Foster Blais-
dell, superintendent of recreation in
Topeka, Kansas, “that when an ade-
quate modern facility is provided for
an activity—whether it be a play-
ground, community center or athletic
field—the increased operation cost, if
any, is very small in proportion to the
tremendous increase in the activity.”
Mr. Blaisdell offers figures to prove his
point in his 1956 Swimming Pool Sum-
mary Report, which shows how Topeka
met the challenge of too many swim-
mers for its out-of-date pools.

In 1954, when the recreation com-
mission took over operation of all the
city’s swimming pools, a program of
swimming classes, synchronized and
competitive swimming was inaugurated.
During the 1955-1956 season, in addi-
tion to the summer program, the Wash-
burn University pool was used on Sat-
urdays, from November to May, for the
trainingprogram for the paid and vol-
untcer staff, as well as for general in-
struction and a synchronized swimming
clinic under the direction of Theresa
Anderson, vice-chairman of the Na-
tional AAU Synchronized Swimming
Committee. The training program for
instructors produced eight water-safety
instructors, two senior lifesavers and

the aides gave approximately fifty hours
of volunteer teaching service during the
next summer swimming season.

The enthusiastic response on the part
of Topeka’s citizens is shown by the in-
crease in total attendance figures at all
municipal pools over the past four

years :

(Pools were operated by the recreation com-
mission 1954-56.)

This tidal wave of swimmers gradu-
ally swamped the city’s facilities. It be-
came increasingly expensive to operate
the superannuated pools and two actu-
ally had to be closed because it was im-
possible to maintain them at a proper
standard of sanitation. One neighbor-
hood pool was closed in 1954, another
in 1955, and a third was reduced to half-
day operation in 1956—and still the
swimmers multiplied!

The most serious problem was Gage
Park Pool, with its total area of nearly
one and a half acres and 61,000 square

four-hour period. Special features of
the $264,338 pool include a separate
wading pool, permanent concrete
bleachers for 350 spectators, open-air
dressing rooms and a parking lot for
four hundred cars. Twenty-eight under-
water lights, in addition to overhead
mercury vapor lights and incandescent
Hoods, make night swimming a pleasure
for both participants and spectators.
Mr. Blaisdell included in his report
a special operating cost breakdown on
the new pool, which was used for ninety-
one days in 1956. Major items were:
approximately $15,000 for salaries and
wages, nearly $2,000 for chemicals, and
$1,000 for lights. The recreation com-
mission has a special arrangement with
the park department covering the use
of water for the pools. Since they are
not metered separately, the park depart-
ment furnishes water without charge
and in return receives the revenue from
all concessions. Total operating cost to
| the commission was under $20,000 for
the first season; revenue amounted to
nearly $30,000 and concessions netted

more than $3,000. The operation thus
yielded a profit despite the fact that
landscaping was not completed prior to
the opening and several storms de-
posited silt in the pool, increasing cost
of filtration and labor. Special eXpenses
incurred in connection with the trial run
also are included in this budget.

Admission fees at both the Cage and
Garfield pools were thirty cents for
adults and fifteen cents for children
under twelve; no admission was
charged at the three neighborhood
pools. In 1956, for the first time, a reg-
istration fee of $1.00 for Topeka resi-
dents and $2.25 for non-residents was
charged for the swimming instruction
program. This resulted in a drop in
registration, but the number qualifying
for Red Cross certificates increased.
The increase probably is attributable
partly to the better teaching facilities
at the new pool and partly to the fact
that pe0ple are more likely to complete
a paid course than a free one. No ad-
mission fees are charged during instruc-
tion periods.

 

An average day park crowd. Permanent concrete bleachers,

Attendance at the old Cage Pool in
1955 was 65,423; the new pool accom-
modated 138,532 swimmers during the
1956 season—yet it cost only ten per
cent more to run than its predecessor,
while revenue doubled. Furthermore,
the new pool was the major factor in
putting the whole swimming program
in the black, since there was a net gain
of more than $3,000 on the over-all pool
operation, whereas the 1955 season
showed a net loss of nearly $11,000. As
more of the old pools, which are so ex-
pensive to run, are replaced by the five
new neighborhood pools specified in the
long-range plan, it is reasonable to sup-
pose that an even greater number of
people will benefit from the swimming
program.

Mr. Blaisdell seems to have proved
his contention, for Topeka at least, that
adequate modern recreation facilities

Business Procedures in P001 Operation

Fees and Charges

The theory of municipal swim-
ming pool charges in most Ameri-
can cities is built upon the payment,
by the users, of the extra cost per
unit of attendance over and above
the average cost per unit of play-
ground and recreation facilities. It
is believed that taXpayers pay for
their public recreation as a govern-

 

ment function, along with other functions of government.
There is a tendency, too often followed by administrative
heads in charge of recreation and park departments, to feel
that swimming pools, because of their popularity, should pay
their way and even furnish additional revenue to the de-
partment. The inclination to raise swimming pool charges
higher and higher is all too common. A sound basis for
charges should be built, setting the fees at a sufficiently high
figure to meet the extra cost per unit to the swimmer and
which is average in any playground or park. For example,
if the total cost of an area to the department, divided among
the number of people using the facilities is fifteen cents per
unit of attendance, and the cost of providing a swim per unit
is thirty cents per unit of attendance, then a charge for the
average of fifteen cents to the swimmer using the swimming
pool is ustified. The swimmer would thus be paying for the
extra cost only because he chooses swimming as his activity,
and the cost of swimming pool operation is high.

Ticket Systems

The best ticket system is none at all, since the machinery
for such a system is costly to provide, costly to collect, and
is considered absolutely unessential to the good operation of
the swimming pool. Any amounts of money lost through
change-making, or otherwise, would not begin to add up to
the cost of any ticket system that could be installed. A cash-

ier making change and ringing up on the cash register is by

far the best scheme of accounting for cash.

However, when ticket systems are installed, the electric
ticket machine, together with the change-maker, is by far
the best system known. This system is the same as that used
in well-operated theaters. Two or even three cashiers may
be necessary during rush periods. We believe shifts are un-
necessary and cause unnecessary inconvenience to patrons,
creating long waiting lines at the entrance gate.

reation conference (1953) in Long Beach.

Reporting Within Department

The entire swimming pool operating staff should report

directly to the supervisor of aquatics, or the superintendent
of recreation in the smaller cities. However, the cashiers
should be the direct line responsibility of the chief account-
ing oHicer, city treasurer, or person to whom the funds are
directly accountable, and not of the superintendent of recre-
ation or other recreation staff person.
Daily Accounting. Since the accounting for all cash register
tapes and tickets and safety of the funds—through a bank
or by operation of a safe-—is the responsibility of people
skilled in handling funds, it is not felt that this is a recrea-
tion responsibility involved in the direct operation of pro-
gram and the handling of personnel and staff at the pool.
For all duties, other than that of line responsibility affect-
ing cash and accounting, cashiers should be responsible to
the swimming pool manager for such items as registration
for lessons, handing out information of events and sched-
ules, maintaining order in the lobby and other details of
operation. All control of money, the accounting and audits,
is therefore made by the people who are held responsible.

Checking Methods
Valuables. Checking all valuables should be done at the

counter and by the person and at the place where fees are
collected. As a sample system: a sealed envelope is handed
the person whose valuables are to be checked; the patron
thus placcs his own valuables in the envelope and signs his
name on the envelope. It is then filed by the attendant in th
proper eubbyhole or drawer set aside for the letter of the
alphabet which is the patron’s initial. \Vhen he calls again
for his valuables, he signs a slip which is compared with th

I  J 'l
. ‘ u .b b
*' ‘* \  045C"

signature on the checking envelope. After he departs, the
envelope is retained by the cashier until the cnd of the day
when all valuables are checked out. As an additional precau-
tion these checking envelopes may be given a serial number
with a tear-off coupon to serve as a receipt for the patron.
Thc patron later on redeems his valuables by signing his
coupon, and thus not only must the signature check, but the
serial number as well. In Los Angeles wc havc found it un-
necessary to employ the latter method. However, the clerk I
or cashicr must never leave her compartment containing valu-

Q

RECREATION I

ables or cash unattended at any time.

Clothing. The most sanitary and space-saving method, and
that best adapted to municipal swimming pools, is the plastic
bag checking scheme. Los Angeles has, down through the
years, tried all possible clothes-checking arrangements, in-
cluding undressing booths, with the clothes checked therein
and a key retained by the patron; steel lockers; wooden
lockers; canvas checking bags; wire mesh baskets; and plas-
tic checking bags. The latter method is now considered to
be the most economical, sanitary, and desirable method.

Rental Practices

Suits. Some bathliouses still rent suits and towels. The ex-
perience with suits and towels in Los Angeles, over a period
of years, has been that fifteen to twenty-five per cent of the
towels were lost or stolen each year, making the cost of such
service exceptionally high. When bathing trunks and swim-
ming suits were rented it was found that in a very short num-
ber of years the style was completely outmoded and patrons
became loath to wear them. Therefore, we have stopped the
renting of any suits or towels entirely, encouraging the
patron to furnish his own. We thus eliminate the laundry
problem, cost of lost towels and suits, and capital expendi-
tures for them. We feel that there is no argument in favor of
furnishing suits and towels to municipal swimming pool

patrons. There can be no need from a sanitary standpoint,
since the chlorinated water amply handles this problem, ac-

cording to our experience and experiments.

Swim Fins and Masks. Swim {ins can be issued free or
rented, if desired. Face masks should not be allowed at the
pool because of the danger of breaking glass and also the
tendency of their use by perverts.

Concessions

It is common practice at European pools, and at many
pools in private clubs in America, to have quick lunch res-
taurants or mechanical vendors to furnish a large variety
of edibles and drinks, anything from a full meal to popcorn,
soft drinks and cones. Coin-in-the-slot hair dryers, combs,
and sanitary pads also are services normally provided at mu-
nicipal swimming pools. One fact is sure: when people
swim their appetite is stimulated. The degree to which mu-
nicipal pools should go into the refreshment business, and
whether they should run it themselves or let it out to con-
cessionnaires is a matter of policy for the operating agency
to decide. The normal percentage of the gross revenue to the
operating agency from various concessions and vending
machines is from tWenty-iive to thirty per cent. Such
revenue is always welcome, and the service is desired by the
public using the pools. I

COME ALONG with

me and I’ll show
you happy people—
people who are really
enjoying their activ-
ities! Laughter and friendly chit-chat
will greet your ears. You may have to
dodge a flying ball. You’ll pass a room
where teen-agers are shaking the walls
with the latest bop steps; you’ll see a
journalism class where young adults
with pencils behind their ears are put-
ting a newspaper to bed; and, on the
stage, actors stumbling through their
lines. Mobiles dangle from the ceiling
and original watercolors paper the wall.
The scene is familiar—a recreation
center; but it is not the usual kind. This
center, in San F rancisco’s Fleishhacker
Pool Building, is for the handicapped.
Here, crutches help a boy to pursue a
ball; pottery is molded with toes by
someone who cannot use his hands.
Voices rise in song—-out of tune, may-

Lucy Muir

be, but, nonetheless, in song.

The Tuesday Young Adults whom we
are about to meet, recently gave a May
Day party. It all began the day the mem-
bers returned from summer vacation.
Wheelchairs, crutches and wheeled cots
transported them to the discussion table
as program planning got under way.

“Let’s have a party planning class,”
someone said. The suggestion was noted
on the program chart and the center’s
founder and director, Janet Pomeroy,
consented to be instructor.

MRS. MUIR, who has been confined to a
wheelchair for ten years with arthritis,
joined the center in 1955. She is now
studying creative writing at San Fran-
cisco State College, writes a “chatty”
column for her local newspaper, is dep-
uty registrar for her home community
of Linda Mar, and does furniture re-
finishing as her main hobby.

. MAY 1957

By the end of six months, the class
had given three parties—a Valentine
party, a make-believe party and, the
biggest and most challenging, a May
Day party.

 

Planning the Party

At the planning session for the May
party, ideas flew back and forth enthusi-
astically. After boisterous nominating
and voting, “Shower of Flowers” was
selected as a theme. Committees were
appointed—invitation, program, decor-
ation, publicity, finance, food, and
clean-up—and the work began.

Although the Tuesday program group
is a small one, members made up a list
of other young adults at the center and
from the San Francisco Guild for Crip-
pled Children and San Francisco State

College, volunteer drivers and staff,

members, whom they might invite to
the party. Also, each member was asked
to bring one guest.

Assignments were given out, with
each member’s abilities and limitations
in mind. Although each person was as-
signed to a committee, no hard and fast
rules were adhered to as to what com-
mittee a person might help on if he had
the time and was needed. Thus commit-
tees that had to await reports from
others, such as finance, or had a limited
sphere of activity, such as publicity,
were able to assist with other major re-
sponsibilities in relation to program,
decoration and food.

A young member of this ingenious group of handicapped at the Rec-
reation Center for the Handicapped, San Francisco, tells the story of their
party—which could be put on by other groups of handicapped persons.

Invitations

Those 011 the invitation committee
gathered at the work table, in assembly-
line order, with each doing his part,
large or small. They cut the invitation
stencil and laboriously turned the hand-
operated mimeograph machine; folded
the mimeographed sheets and decorated
the front covers with crepe-paper and
glitter umbrellas. The completed invita-

' tions were finally signed, sealed, and

sent out RSVP to one hundred friends.

Decorations

One of the girls deftly twisted crepe-
paper and wood-fiber flowers onto plas-
tic headbands to make crowns for the
May queen and her attendants. Another
rounded up a large square of canvas
and paint and turned out a “Shower of
Flowers” entrance sign. Others made
crepe-paper flowers to be placed in col-
ored-paper cornucopias for the wall de-
cor. Large tree branches, painted green,
were Sprinkled liberally with flowers.

 

A11 old umbrella was re-covered to
make a spring parasol to decorate the
refreshment table. First the cloth was
stripped from the frame; then twine was
stretched from spoke to spoke, all the
way around. Pink net was caught up in
a pom-pom at the umbrella tip, draped
over the twine, and sewed in place. The
handle was covered with white poster
paint and, while still wet, sprinkled with
silver sparkles. Suspended over one end

183

 

of the refreshment table by invisible
threads taped to the ceiling, the parasol
added a gay spring touch to the decor-

ations.

 

Two of the boys pooled their talents
and built a wishing well—-—-a large h00p
of chicken wire covered with “paper
rocks.” For days everyone saved their
lunch sacks to be used in making arti-
ficial rocks. The bags were crumpled to
give rock-like texture, cut open and
spread flat, then colored with red, brown

and green chalk. The four corners of .

each bag were gathered and stapled,
squeezed into the shape of a rock and
afhxed to the wire frame with masking
tape. The arch over the well was made
from a piece of three-eighth-inch wood,
curved and fastened to the wire frame.
Crepe-paper flowers decorated the arch
and a small can was suspended from it
as a bucket. A pan of water was placed
in the bottom of the well to catch the
coins thrown in by people making a
wish.

Three Maypoles for the Maypole
Dance were made of one-and-three-
eighths-inch dowling. The tops of the
poles were drillcd andwires run through
the holes and attached to the ceiling
light fixtures. The bottoms of the poles
were secured to thc floor with strips of
masking tape. Eight streamcrs—strips
of paste] crepe-paper one and a half in-
ches wide—were fastened to the top of
each pole.

Finances

The total cost of the party was $23.20
————for food, $15; decorations, $3.70;

invitations, $2.50; program $2.00.

The Big Day Arrives

0n the day of the party, the kitchen
bummed with activity as the cooking
class made cupcakes and chopped fruit
for the strawberry punch. The party
room was also a beehive of activity—

184

what with furniture moving, the decor-
ating of the screen to serve as a back-
ground for the queen’s throne, and sun-
dry other final preparations.

At seven o’clock, as a spotlight beam-
ed on the wishing well and the Maypole
streamers waved invitingly from their
stately heights, the guests began to ar-
rive. Each one was greeted cordially
and presented with a corsage. The
party activities were under way.

Program

In the first game——-an ice-breaker—
an advertisement, cut from a p0pular
magazine, was pinned on the back of
each guest. He was asked to guess what
he was advertising and had to go
around asking other guests questions,
such as, “Do I eat it?” and so on.

When the ice.was well broken and all
the guests acquainted, the three candi-
dates for queen were introduced. A vote
was taken and the newly elected queen
was crowned and enthroned to reign
over the Maypole Dance.

 

In the dance, four men and four wom-
en were assigned to each of the three
poles. Dancers in wheelchairs were
maneuvered by others who could push

 without use of their crutches. The men

went in one direction and the women
in thc other. As a man met the first
woman, he lifted his streamer over hers,
then under the next one’s streamer, and
so on, until the poles were wound to the
bottom. Strauss waltzcs were played all
during the dance, and those who didn’t
join enjoyed watching.

Next came a “Name That Flower”
quiz. Players were asked to name the
flower suggested by the following defini-
tions, with three points given for each
correct name:

1. Unattached-male fasteners.

2. Head coverings of a certain color.
3. Dawn in all its splcndor.

4. Dripping organ of the body.

 

Even a lraflic jam can be fun—when it‘s
accompanied by a lively Strauss waltz!

HANDFUI. of physically handi-

capped persons responded to invi-
tations from the recreation department
in Lima, Ohio, to attend the first meet-
ing of the “Able-Disabled Club” one
year ago. Interest snowballed after
that, and in a few months active mem-
bership included thirtyrpersons.

A mailing list had been compiled and
the recreation department had sent a
mimeographed letter describing the
proposed venture to all handicapped
persons in the community. Reply cards
indicating interest in such a club were
returned by nearly all of those who had
received them.

Organization

Since that first meeting in January
1956, meetings have heen held each
month in the multi-purpose room of one
of Lima’s elementary schools. A one-
step entry at the school makes the room
easily accessible to those on crutches
and in wheelchairs. Almost as impor-
tant are the piano and adjoining kitchen
facilities.

The group voted to name their or-
ganization the “Able-Disabled Club,” a
name which expressed their belief that
ability and disability can go hand in
hand. Officers have been elected—pres-
ident, vice-president, secretary-treas-
urer, and historian—committees have
been appointed, and a constitution and

. We like the phil050phy that ability and disability can go hand in hand. We
like the independence of this club in working out its own program and its basic
acceptance of civic responsibility. For those leaders or executives who have not

yet included the handicapped in their programs, or who have worked only with
handicapped children, this story of the Able-Disabled Club in Lima, Ohio, may

serve as a model and incentive.

by-laws drawn up and adopted since
that initial get-together. The object of
the Able-Disabled Cluh, as stated in its
constitution, isito “strive to promote
the social, economic, and moral welfare
of physically handicapped persons in
general and of its members in particu-
lar.”

Four classes of membership are pro-
vided—aetive, associate, junior. and
honorary. Active membcrship is_ re-
stricted to physically handicapped per-
sons sixteen years of age and older. Be-
cause it was felt that there might be
physically handicapped individuals in
the community, eligible for member-
ship but unable to attend meetings in
person, who would like to be a part of
the venture, provision was made for
associate membership. While member-
ship is primarily adult. since active
memhership is restricted to the physi-
cally handicapped aged sixteen or older,
junior memberships are granted those

, under sixteen who. in the estimation of

the membership committee, would bene-
fit by membership and be an asset to
the club. Honorary membership has
been bestowed upon several non-handi-
eappcd individuals who have worked
hard to make the club successful. Asso-
ciate, junior, and honorary members
have all the rights and duties of active
membership except the right to hold
oflice and to 'vote.

Concerned that no pcrson should feel
he could not afford to belong to the
Able-Disahlcd Club. members agreed
that no regular ducs should be exacted.
Instead, a voluntary collection is taken
at each meeting.

Permanent committees are member-
ship. program and finance. The mem-
bership committee. composed of five ac-
tive members. makes inquiry concern-
ing applicants for membership. deter-
mines their eligibility, and reports
approved applications to the club.
Although the set-up for the program
committec 1s a unique arrangement. It
has worked well. For each meeting a
difierent member is in charge of the
program and works with the recreation
department supervisor iii planning ac-
tivities for the evening. Thus there are
twelve program chairmen in the course
of a year. and these twelve members
comprise the program committee. The
finance committee, hcaded by the treas-
urer, is charged with the duty of raising
funds for club purposes.

Answering roll call at meetings of the
Able-Disabled Club are persons dis-
abled by disease. injury, and congenital
problems. Cerebral palsy. polio. m uscu-
lar dystrophy, blindness, and spinal in-
jury are among the causes of disability
represented.

Activities

The Able-Disabled Club is fortunate

in having in its membership several mu-
sicians who are generous with their
talents. Members always enjoy gather-
ing around the piano to sing familiar
songs accompanied by one of the blind
members who teaches piano and organ.

RECREATION

At one meeting a “games night” was
planned. Tables were set up and such
table games- as checkers, Scrabble,
Sorry and cards-were played. At another
meeting, members eXperimented with
square dancing, wheelchairs, canes. and
all, under the direction of the recreation
department supervisor. “We’re lucky
we escaped with our lives!” was one
comment. But it was fun, and it proved
and confirmed the suspicion that mem-
bers were game to try practically any-
thing. Films have been a popular source
of entertainment, particularly as illus-
tration for a speaker’s text.

During the summer months a num-
her of outdoor events have been en-
joyed. A potluck picnic was attended
also by members from two of the Indi-
ana handicapped organizations, the
Fort Wayne Samaritans and the Bluff-
ton On-Our-Own Club.

The October program, a combination
Hallowe’en and birthday party engi—
neered by two of the club members, was
a high point of the year, an aim for sub-
sequent program chairmen. The party
was held in a recreation hall in a near-
by community. Decorated with witches
astride broomsticks, a life-size skeleton,
and orange and black crepe paper
streamers, the hall looked a fit abode for
goblins and ‘masqueraders. Stretching
diagonally across the hall, decorated to
present the birthday theme, was a long
tahle, sectioned off by months, where
members were seated in their birth-

month sections. Refreshments included.

the traditional birthday cake and ice
cream.

Turkey sandwiches, pumpkin pie, cof-
fee and hot chocolate made up the
Thanksgiving menu for the November
meeting. A word game devised by the
program committee was played.

In December, the Christmas story was
read aloud from a hraille Bible; Christ-
mas carols were sung; and there was
an exchange of fifty-cent gifts. The
Christmas menu was a potpourri of
Christmas cookies, caramel corn, home-
made candies, with each member con-
tributing something, plus coffee.

Such interesting and different pro-
grams as the showing of a sound film
on vocational rehabilitation by the local
Goodwill Industries director, a musical
comedy skit by a member of the Bluff-
ton Club (a wheelchair-er with muscu-
lar dystr0phy) and two associates will
add significance and spice to future
meetings of the Able-Disabled Club.

' The Able-Disabled Club in its first
year has become a potent and worthwhile
part of the Lima community. Coopera-
tion among members and their families
is phenomenal. Come club night, mem-
bers pool their cars in a share-the ride-
network that greatly alleviates the ever-
present transportation problem. After
the meetings the boys fold and put away
the chairs, while others make certain
the kitchen is in apple-pie order. “You
don’t leave me much to do,” the school
custodian remarked after a recent club
meeting. Refrcshments for the firsl
three meetings were provided by the
Helping Hand Club, a local women’s
service club; but now that the club is
on its feet, so to speak, each month’s
program chairman is responsible for
preparing and serving light refresh-
ments, paid for by the club, and here
the mothers have done yeoman service.

When the club voted to sponsor a
square dance to raise money for club
purposes, virtually none of the members
knew anything about sponsoring such
an event; but each joined wholeheart-
edly in making posters, selling tickets,
and all the other chores on which the
success or failure of the affair hinged.
The recreation department provided a
large pavilion in one of the city parks,
and a local square-dance band and call-
er furnished the music. Proceeds fat-

tened the club treasury by some eighty

dollars.
To those who have watched the Able-

Disabled Club grow, it secms impos-
sible to overestimate its value. Recrea-
tion is essential to every individual and
particularly to physically handicapped
persons. The camaraderie of the
monthly get-togethers, the parties and
other activities fulfill the normal human
need for a social life. Through the club,
members have had grcater opportunity
to participate in community affairs and
have demonstrated their community
spirit by endorsing a bond issue for a
new public library, before the last elec-
tion, and making a gift of an assortment
of books to the patients of a tuberculosis
hospital.

Prior to joining the club, many mem-
bers had ventured outside their homes
only rarely; now they find themselves
speaking up during business meetings
and taking part in various club projects.

' While the Able-Disabled Club is spon-

sored and supervised by the recreation
department, members have been encour-
aged to take the initiative. Thus mem-
bership in the Able-Disabled Club
proves a valuable as well as an enjoya-
ble experience. I

Boys, Bikes- and Safety

 

Bieyele rodeos are a popular means of
learning safety rules and proper eon-
trol. This boy in Salinas, California,
reereation department, is engaged in
steering his bike along narrow line.

for: THE past eight years, a happy

youngster has won a beautifully-
equipped bicycle—“grand prize” in the
annual month-long Newport News (Vir-
ginia) Bicycle Safely Campaign.

The campaign begins the first of each
May, with some five thousand school
children taking part. During the month.
youngsters amass points for excellence
in four separate safety events. On the
thirtieth of May, a colorful bicycle
rodeo is held. in the grand parade.
points are given for the hest decorated
bike, and for “win. place, show. or par-
ticipating," in each of four field-day
events. Top scorer for the month wins
a new bicycle; reconditioned bikes go to
second and third place winners.

traffic accidents among school children
is jointly sponsored by the NeWport
News Boys Club and the local Kiwanis
Club with the c00peration of the board
of education, recreation department and
police department. Some such program
was needed because of the tremendous
increase of automobiles on the streets
and the simultaneous increase of young-
sters riding bicycles to school. This
dangerous traffic situation was the re-
sult of the large increase in population
during and after World War II.

Participation in the earliest bicycle
safety campaigns was disappointingly
small, but today they not only attract
the large number of youngsters, but also
garner considerable regional attention.

The campaign is divided into two
parts or contests. The first, operating
throughout all but the last day, includes
the granting of points for the best safety
scrapbooks, for tickets given by New-
port News police to safe bike riders, for
the best safety slogans submitted, and
for the best answers to questions on
bicycle safety. There are first, second.
third, and participating prize winners
for each of these. In addition to points.
successful entrants in the preliminary
contests also win merchandise prizes.

The other part of the campaign takes
place during the final bicycle' rodeo.
Before a large crowd of students and
parents, successful rodeo contestants
win first, second and third prizes—and
points toward the grand prize.

About a week after the rodeo, when
the final scores have hecn compiled, an
award ceremony is held, often in a
major downtown auditorium. Here,
grand and lesser prizes are presented.

The safety scrapbook competition is
relatively new, hut it has proved popu-
lar and is, according to Harry Shoff, the
Boys Club program director, scheduled
for permanent inclusion in the bicycle
safety program. Entrants are encour-

gram publicity pictures of bicycles in
action which are observing safety rules
and to write essays on safety.

The competition which sees the grant-
ing of points for receiving a “safety
ticket” from a member of the NeWport
News police force is really a passive
competition. The youngster doesn’t
have to enter. He is in the contest auto-
matically if he rides a bicycle in a New-
port News school area.

Every day during the campaign. traf-
fic policemen. in patrol cars.cruise areas
around selected school grounds. When
an officer sees a youngster obeying traf-
fic regulations as he rides down the
street—such as rendering proper arm
signals and stopping at octagonal signs
——he drives up to the rider. siren scream-
ing and red light flashing. He pulls the
youngster over to the curb f always in
full view of his schoolmatesl and so-
berly writes out a “safety ticket.”

This ticket. in realityan acknowledge-
ment hy the police force that the young-
ster is a safe bike rider. may be re-
deemed for two passes to a local movie
theater. The safety ticket is also good I
for twenty-five points toward the grand
prize, but only one such point award is
given to any one contestant. Newport
News police have been enthusiastic
about this dramatic type of safety train-
ing, and the youngsters love it.

The safety slogan contest is also good
for points toward the grand prize and
for individual awards. Youngsters par-
ticipatitig are required to submit a ten-
word slogan on bicycle safety to New-
port News Boys _Club headquarters. The
best slogan wins forty points toward the
grand prize: the second best. thirty
points: third place. twenty points: and
participation brings ten points.

Last of the prc-rodeo events is the *

trants fill and send to Boys Club head-

quarters. Questions are of the “yes”
or “no” variety. They are not “catch
questions,” but test the boys thoroughly
on their knowledge of the operation of
the bicycle and the laws which govern
its use. Boys who answer thirty or more
of the questions correctly receive a hand-
some certificate suitable for framing,
signed by the president of the Newport
News Kiwanis Club and the local chief
of police. Youngsters correctly answer-
ing all the questions receive, in addi-
tion, thirty-five points toward the grand
prize.

Contestants wheel around the track pcriod to emphasise “safety,” and it

to band music piped in through a pub- .

lic address system. A recent winner of
the contest rode a bicycle decorated to
resemble a Shetland pony. and wore the
colorful costume of a Mexican cowboy.

Skill events of the rodeo are designed
to exhibit ability to handle bikes in the
many difficult situations which occur
in riding on city streets. in the “slow
race,” for example, the boys attempt to
ride down a three-foot-wide lane, sev-
enty-five yards in length. They are not

.permitted to touch either sideline. The

youngster who finishes last is the win-
ner. The event is designed to teach bal-
ance and ability to ride slowly in moving
traffic. As in the other events, points are
given.

in the “zigzag race,” the boys are
taught coordination of mind and muscle.
Contestants ride down a three-foot lane
in the center,of which quart-sized oil
cans have been placed at six-foot inter—
vals. Riders must stay inside the lane
and zig-zag between the cans.

The “plank ride” is considered the
toughest of all the skill-riding contests.
In preparation for the event, a number
of wooden planks, four inches wide and
a quarter-inch thick, are laid end to end
on the pavement. Contestants must ride
down this narrow strip of wood-track
without permitting either wheel to slip
off onto the pavement.

The most popular race, at least the
one which attracts the greatest number
of entrants, is the “speed race.” Ori-
ginally, it was decided to eliminate this
type of competition; but the youngsters
—perhaps, naturally—were so anxious
to participate in it, that it was finally
allowed to remain in the schedule of
events. Today, it is a permanent fixture.

With so many youngsters partici-
pating in the safety campaign, the num-
ber of grand prize points which must be
catalogued and tallied is staggering. It
would be a fitting climax to the bicycle
rodeo if the three grand prizes and the
many subordinate awards could be
fnade immediately following the con-
tests of skill. Unfortunately, the enor-
mous ob of counting points makes this
an impossibility; so the award cere-
mony is held about a week later. This
seeming liability has been turned into
an advantage because it prolongs the

adds an element of suspense to the prize
awarding.

The award ceremony takes place be-
fore a large crowd of Newport News
students, parents and spectators. The
Kiwanis Club supplies all prizes, making
this donation a permanent part of their
annual community service program.
They also assist in publicizing thecam-
paign and lend manpower, know-how,
and technical assistance whenever called?

The bicycle safety campaign is now
a permanent part of the NeWport News
scene. It also has been adopted com-
pletely or in part by other cities through-W
out the country, where a bicycle safety
problem exists. One such community
is Oswego, New York, where the cam-
paign goes a step further and includes
inspection and registration of bicycles
as a qualification for entry in its various
contests. l

ingham, Washington, we’d still know
that someone with direct and personal
eXperience on playgrounds had written
this book. The chapter on safety, for
example, is a dead giveaway. What per-
son unfamiliar with playground situa-
tions, or how children behave on ap-
paratus, could have included, “Guard
against the use of wax paper bread
wrappers to make the slide slick”?

The livcly illustrations, on which sev-
eral artists collaborated, not only clearly
eXplain the games and game formations,
but depict as diverting a set of young
hellions as any playground leadcr has
ever seen. Those illustrations are worth
the cost of the book!

Mr. Geri’s preface and opening chap-
ter are short but successfully explain
his purposc. The book deals primarily
with that nine-to-twelve-year-old group
that is nature’s bcst answer to perpetual
motion. He emphasizes the importance
of games in teaching body skills, and
the need for proper instruction so that,
at home or at unsupervised periods, the
youngster not only knows what to play,
but how to play, in order to get thc most
satisfaction from the activity.

The book is divided into a number of
game categories: tag, circle, nature,
limited area, relays, hardtop, and goal

games, an excellent section on rhythms,
including very sound suggestions for
and square
dancing. It also includes rules for jacks,
rope umping, hopscotch and other tra-
ditional, seasonal games, as well as basic
techniques for instruction in the high-
organized games of soccer, baseball and
softball, as well as lead-up games in
these.

This is not “just another game book.”
Its good natural, realistic approach,
clear eXplanations and emphasis on
having reasons for games makes it par-
ticularly effective for a new staff, or for
a staff that has become “settled” in its
game program. —— Virginia M ussefman,

June Jahnson. Harper & Brothers,
4'9 East 33rd Street, New York 16. Pp.
140. $2.95.

partments to use in giving workshops

This is a most unusual and fasci-
nating book by a famous float and
parade echrt. While it will not be par-
ticularly useful for simple little play-
ground parades or floats, it should be

splendid affairs. In addition to many
diagrams, suggestions for building and
decorating, plans for organization, it
contains interesting chapters on parades
through the ages. PhotOgraphs, prints
and drawings add to the usefulness of

His definition of a boy will plea.
every dad: “A boy is one of the grc '-
wonders and one of the most valuabl
things in our world. He is the futur
with a freckled face and skinned elbows
-—the future straining with tremendou
energy in a fierce, bewildering tangle o r
wonder, hero-worship, enthusiasm, im-
agination, appetite, and mild mischief.”
