Ordinary plungers don’t seat
properly. They permit com-
pressed air and water to splash
back. Thus you not only have
a mess, but you lose the very
pressure you need to clear the
obstruction.

With “TOILAFLEX”, ex-
pressly designed for toilets, no
air or water can escape. The
full pressure plows through the
clogging mass and swishes it
down. Can’t miss!

“The Squeeze Out”

Sirs:

Certainly Sid Lutzin {in “The Squeeze
Out,” October 1962) has made state-
ments on conditions that those of us in
the field of recreation administration
are living with, are adjusting to, or, I
am afraid, are ignoring in some cases.
This article has given us cause to pause
and take a look at the direction in which
we are going.

For instance, he indicates that the fee
system is placing recreation services on
an “in-between” level in the community.
A review of our [local] existing fee
system showed that we had applied to
some operational activities a regulatory
fee, such as $.15 per swim in our public
pools for youth seventeen years and
under. This fee, however, is comple-
mented by free learn-to-swim classes, so
that no youth can be denied the educa-
cational joy of water. The regulatory
fee applies to protect to some extent
against the health abuses of indiscrimi-
nate swimming. We were looking for a
possible price-out, hut did not find it in
this area of responsibility, nor in other
areas to which a regulatory fee had
been applied as an administrative aid.

We then took a look at our fee system
covering the cost of the activity and in
some cases the leadership. This applies
to highly specialized recreation activi—
ties, such as n'olf, large group picnic
reservations in mountain parks, and
square dancing, mainly an adult activi-
ty. We find that the fee system estab-
lished several years ago for the purpose

of cost administration has fallen hehind '

because of the: increased costs that go
with leadership and maintenance.

We also took a look at our relation-
ships in the community, and checked
with the Coordinating Council of the
Denver Metropolitan Council for Com-
munity Service to see what direction
private-quasi-public and national rec-
reation agencies had been taking. We
were reminded of and reviewed studies
made hy these agencies relative to mov-
ing to other areas of interest. In every
case where the study was valid it was
recommended that the service should
remain or he assumed by other agen-
eies. or the study showed that there was
validity in transferring out because of
urban renewal, commercial zoning, or
industrial development.

' To some extent. we found a rather
concerned cooperative and coordinated
planning point of view in the evaluation
of existing services and replacement of
those services to be moved, but the
trend certainly was one, as Mr. Lutzin

J ANUARY. 1963

pointed out. of moving with the chang-
ing times. One of our concerns—a pro-
posal to move a neighborhood recrea-
tion center- -was part of a study. The
outcome was that none of the agencies
could justify leaving a changing eco-
nomic situation, and attention then was
focused upon enlarging, expanding, or
extending a new service by one of the
agencies into the new area of concern.

In closing. this ofiice would not refute
the statements made by Mr. Lutzin. We
would recognize that all administrators
must review their associations with
other community services and reconfirm
their faith in coordinated and coopera-
tive planning for community services,
lest the popularity of serving those who
can afford some of the services should
overcome the basic need of service to
all. Yet we must realize that the Ameri-
can way still is to give major assistance
in helping people to help themselves,
whether it is in recreation or living in a
democratic society. Otherwise we will
nurture a class of “do-fors” rather than
a class of “do-withs” who can arrive at
an independent performance level.

tion, Deparlrrien! of Parks and Rec-
reation, City and County of Denver,

Recreation for ALL Children

Sirs:

“Where may we send our children to
play and be sure they will be given a
good program with adequate super-
vision?” This was a question asked hy
the parents of the Irwin Parent Associa-
tion for Retarded Children at a meeting
held March 20, 1962.

Children in the Irwin, North Irwin,
and North Huntingdon Townships area
in Pennsylvania are more fortunate than
those of many communities because
there are many varied recreation activi-
tics provided for their enjoyment. Our
school district provides both a summer
and a winter recreation program. As
recreation director, I organize and set
up a well-varied program for most age
categories for both boys and girls.

In the summer we have twenty play-
grounds in operation. Most of these
playgrounds are well equipped with ap-
paratus provided by local sponsoring
groups. Our playgrounds operate as
three separate groups under the leader-
ship of competent program directors
who correlate our programs. There are
softball and volleyball leagues for girls.
and basehall, softball, basketball, and
football for boys. Other activities in-

clude arts and crafts, dancing, baton
twirling, swimming and dramatics.

During the months of November
through April, recreation is provided in
five of our school buildings equipped to
facilitate recreation activities. The pro-
gram includes girls from grades three
through twelve and boys from grades
five thrOUgh twelve. Some of the activi-
ties are dancing, baton twirling, volley-
ball, basketball, gymnastics, a11d other
organized games. The community also
has a Police Athletic League which pro-
vides an excellent program in basket-
ball and baseball during the seasons,
and the N orwin Community Athletic As-
sociation provides an excellent program

of basketball, baseball. and football
during the year.

At that March meeting of the PARC,
which the school director, William
Miller, and I attended, the question con-

cerning a play area and program for the
retarded children was raised. 1 im-

mediately realized that alloof our area
recreation was geared to the students in
our regular schools and nothing to the
special education children. Steps were
immediately taken to rectify this.

Through the diligent efforts of the
PARC president, Mrs. John Drylie, and
her group, the Norwin School Board,
the administration, and myself, a play-
ground for both the trainables and edu-
cables of our area became a reality.
The building and grounds was provided
by the Area Suburban Church, the
PARC provided transportation and
funds for equipment, and the Norwin
School Board employed and paid the
two playground directors.

The two instructors were people who
have been working with retarded chil-
dren. Elma Byerly, teacher of a train-
able class in Irwin, and Raymond Glad-
den, principal of the Coulterville School
for educables in Greensburg, did an ex-
cellent job during the summer. Approxi-
mately thirty children attended the play-
ground each day from 10AM to 3PM.
They had a varied daily program which
included many of the regular play-
ground activities geared to their level.
The children carried their lunch and
had a supervised lunch period.

The Baldoc Country Club in Irwin
permitted us to use their pool to con-

duct a swimming program for these
children each Monday. The children
were tran5ported to the pool by Mrs.
Rominger, a member of the local
PARC, and two qualified Red Cross
recreation swimming instructors super-
vised four children each hour. The pro-
gram was very beneficial to the retarded
children of the area, and next year, with
more COOperation, we eXpect to offer an
even better program for our children in
special education classes in our area.

JOSEPH PRENDERGAST

STUDIES made by the National Recrea-
tion Association have repeatedly
shown that what people say they want
for recreation and what they will, in
fact, choose given the opportunity are
not always the same. Certain types of
recreation have more prestige value
than others. ln answering a question-

 

naire, a girl might say she’d like to play tennis because it
sounds like a nice thing to do; but if the tennis court were
provided she might never use it. Her lack of use might be
caused by lack of training or by a basic lack of interest in
the game. In either case, her reply would be unreliable as a
planning guide. This does not necessarily contradict the ax-
iom that “Access Promotes Use.” Access does promote use,
but not so universally as we might think. Nobody needs any
special skill to enjoy a park or a picnic ground, but access
to bicycle trails does not necessarily bring out a torrent of
cyclists, although it will encourage some.

In trying to discover what people want for recreation,
therefore, we must consider many factors. First, we know
that people tend to choose the kind of recreation with which
they are already familiar. Not everyone lives near a beach
but everyone knows about swimming and water sports. Tra-
ditional outdoor concerts are enjoyed by many who wouldn’t
enter a concert hall. Second, we know that people will choose
even a new and untried recreation if it somehow captures
their imagination. A good illustration of this is the recent
growth of science projects in camping—still not widespread
but coming. Another is the tremendous increase in pleasure
boating in recent years. The association of pleasure boating
with the good life has attracted many people who don’t care
a great deal about boats as such, as well as many who do.
Third, we know that a certain proportion of our population
seeks activities with challenge——the challenge of skill, even
of danger. As our daily lives become more routine we can

expect this hunger for challenge in recreation to grow greater.

V I ‘IIIS NEED is a very serious matter. It is not to be passed
over lightly with the observation that people who want

challenge and danger will probably find them. There is some

reation Association.

JANUARY, 1963

reason to believe that it is closely related to many of the dis-
turbances in young peOple that produce what we call delin-
quent behavior and what the Russians call hooliganism. A
recent article in The New York Times on the children of the
Russian managerial class points out that they are showing
exactly the same symptoms of revolt and boredom as some
of our own comfortably situated youngsters. The common
factor here is clearly not the social and political system. One
thing our great youth organizations in this country have dis-
covered, however: apparently normal young people whose
lives are too well ordered, too protected, pleasant, and com-
fortable will find some way to subject themselves to danger
and hardship and strange shocks and stresses. They will do
it by hotrodding and playing “chicken”; they will do it by
excessive drinking and experimenting with dope even in
“nice” families; they will do it in irrational bursts of destruc-
tive violence. The youth organizations, mindful of their re-
sponsibilities, say there is a need for “safe adventure,” but it
is clear that the wort “safe” is added by adults. not by the
young.

What does this fact say to us about what people want in
recreation—and especially the outdoor recreation? lt shows
that, instead of saying “Give us men to match our moun-
tains,” we must demand “mountains to match our men.”
We must keep our wilderness areas as well as our pleasant
parks; we must devise challenging sports, such as water ski-
ing; and we must not let even such new and perilous sports
as sky diving frighten us into thinking we can kill man’s
adventurous spirit by banning participation ust because of
potential danger. Let us, in short, recognize and reckon with
the fact that one thing some people want in recreation is
challenge.

We have observed that people will choose recreation be-
cause it is familiar but they will also choose recreation be-
cause it is new—if it somehow catches their imagination.
We have also noted that some people will choose recreation
that is challenging, but, along with this fact, we should also
note that people, in increasing numbers, seem to prefer rec-
reation that families can enjoy together.

Our correspondence at the National Recreation Associa-
tion and reports from community recreation departments
have shown this trend for a number of years. Sales of
big department stores and mail-ordcr houses show growth
in the type of purchases that indicate family activities. and

l

the Rockefeller Commission report further confirms this.
Not only is there a tremendous amount of family camping,
games such as badminton, and recreation such as picnick—
ing. but bowling has already become a family game, and
that last citadel of male aloneness is falling—women are
going fishing in ever-increasing numbers.

AMBIVALENCE is a major characteristic of people’s rec-

reation desires. They want the familiar, yet they will
follow a new fad: they want thrills and challenge, yet they
will also stay in the bosom of the family. Part of this ambiv-
alence is due, of course, to the diversity of people. There
is no such thing as an average American who wants to spend
a third of his recreation with his family picnicking at the
beach: a third of his recreation mountain climbing; and a
third riding around in his car listening to a symphony broad-
cast. Instead, there are some Americans who will do all these
things and some who will do none of them.

What do Americans want for recreation? They want what
they can get. they want what they can dream about, they want
what they can be persuaded to want, and they sometimes
want things that parents or governors in their wisdom think
they shouldn’t have. Yet, by almost any standard we can
offer, most people, given enough skills and educational back-
ground to feel secure among many choices, will choose
wisely.

You will notice that I have said “given enough skills and
educational background to feel secure.” This is an increas-
ineg important point and one which is of special concern
to all those who have been given or who have assumed any
leadership in our use of human or natural rcsources. It is
just as important in outdoor recreation as in any other use
of our leisure time.

We cannot expect a man to enjoy what some authorities
consider “good” music if he has never heard any or has
heard it under the most uncomfortable circumstances. How-
ever, he might find a whole new world of delight opening to
him if he had a chance to get acquainth with some of the
great music of the world in a wholly natural way. This is
actually happening to more and more pc0ple now through
music participation programs in recreation groups. Such
concepts as the National Cultural Center. if properly worked
out, can further advance our citizens’ enjoyment of the arts

When writing to our advertisers nlease mention RECREATION.

WE WANT to have prosperity; but in order that

prosperity and material gain shall not prove
a curse instead of a blessing, we must do all we
can to promote the refining influences of life——

pr0per means of recreation, wholesome enjoy-
ment, the cultivation of those capacities for de—
light and pleasure which alone make the gains
of prosperity a blessing to the human soul.
——CHARLES EVANS HUGHES.

 

through inspiration to the amateur as well as reward to the
professional (see also Page 11).

In outdoor recreation, we cannot expect a man to play
tennis if he does not know how to hold a racquet; a woman
who takes up hiking ought to know something about prop-
erly fitted boots; and we certainly don’t want any untrained
youngsters to go out and drown themselves undcr the im-
pression that they’re skin-diving.

In short, there is a tremendous opportunity and a tre-
mendous responsibility for leadership in recreation.

AMERICANS are still a mobile, rcasonahly vigorous people.

They are willing to learn, eager to try attractive new
ideas. Many of them are not aware of the great potential of
their own leisurc hut they will begin to recognize it once it
is pointed out. They may have to revise old concepts about
only paid work heing worthwhile. Instead, they can accept
the idea that a man’s worth is not measured by his paid job
but by what he docs with his total allotment of time—his
employment, paid or unpaid. Leadership can help Ameri-
cans rcalize all that recreation can mean——-and thereby
change what Americans want for recreation.

When Americans realize that recreation can have many
new dimensions, they will look for them. And what will they
find? Will they find that it is impossihle to draw inspira-
tion from the mountains because the view is covered with
gum-wrappers and beer cans? Will they find “No Swim-
ming" signs posted beside the polluted watcrs? Will the}
find dingy community centers with paint peeling from the
walls and no rooms for discussion or the creative arts? Will
they want symphony concerts and Greek drama as well as
picnicking in their parks—only to find that the land for the
amphitheater has been sold?

One thing is sure——-they will want the familiar and the
unfamiliar. inspiration, vigorous physical challenge, culture.
However, unless mankind changes completely, people will
still want recreation that stretches their minds and their
bodies: that draws them closer to their families and friends:
that sends them out in lonely exploration.

New horizons for recreation beckon us. What people
want for recreation is constantly expanding. The object of
our game is not just to keep up with the demand but to keep
ahead of it with space, facilities, leadership. If we do that.
no matter what the recreation targets of the year 2000. our
children will find that the launching platform is ready and
the road to the stars has been kept clear. #-

AS WE GO TO PRESS

 

_> A FOUR-LANE OCEAN PARKWAY versus
a national seashore park on Fire Island,
off the south shore of Long Island, New
York, is the subject of a bitter battle on
the part of a citizens’ committee for the
seashore idea-———strong in the assurance
that citizens do have a powerful voice in
their own destiny. Facts and statements
supporting their belief have been scat-
tered far and wide by the committee.
One great economic advantage for Long
Island in having Fire Island a national
seashore is that its erosion problems
could be taken over and financed hy the
federal government. The island has suf-
fered mightily during recent hurricane
seasons.

) THE NEW NRA Field Service gal, Pat
Schmidt, who has replaced Helen Daun-
cey as social recreation specialist and
Katherine F. Barker Memorial Secre-
tary for recreation with women and
girls, sets out on a swing around the
country to visit all Air Force hases in
her path to carry on Miss Dauncey’s
work and supply consultation service
and leadcrship training for the base or
base-community recreation programs
for Air Force dependents. This will be
Pat‘s second trip as an NRA staff mem-
ber.

) A 25TH ANNIVERSARY is being ob-
served by AnIerica’s favorite footpath,
the Appalachian Trail, which stretches
from Maine to Georgia. This should be
of interest to peOple of all ages. We
noted in The New York Times of Sep-
temher 18, 1962 that, in 1955, a 6"-
year-old grandmother covered the
length of trail, 2,050 miles, and wore
out seven pairs of shoes in the process.
W’hat price recreation? Two years, and
several great-grandchildren later, she
repeated the feat.

One hiker wrote of this trail, “Re-
mote for detachment, narrow for chosen
company, winding for leisure, lonely for
contemplation, the trail leads not merely
north and south but upward to the body,
mind, and soul of man.”

) TEEN PROBLEMS ANONYMOUS, or
TPA, is the name of a nonprofit organ-
ization operating in the area of Lancas-
tcr, Pennsylvania, under the auspices of
the Committee of 100, for the sole pur-
pose of helping young peOple solve per-
sonal problems. All services are confi-
dential. For further information, write
the Committee, P.O. Box 1313, Lancas-

ter.

) ACCORDING to the new postal rates, in

effect after January 6, 1963, letters will
cost five cents per ounce, air mail eight

JANUARY, 1963

cents, and post and postal card four
cents. ( Y on might check your diction-
ary [or the fine distinction between post-
cards and postal cards.)

The minimum charge per piece of
second-class mail will remain at an
eighth of a cent for qualified nonprofit
publications. (The Senate Committee
had proposed doubling this rate.) How-
ever, the per-pound rate for nonprofit,
second-class publications will be raised
slightly, in three steps. After January
6, it will be 1.6 cents; during 1964 it
will be 1.7 cents; and thereafter it will
be 1.8 cents.

You may expect to be asked by the
Postmaster General for a report justify-
ing your right to this preferential rate.
The House passed a bill authorizing him
to inquire into the eligibility of some
ten thousand publications in this cate-
gory. Senate debate indicatcd that some
senators favor such an investigation or
questionnaire, with or without Specific
legislative authorization.

The per-piece minimum rate for
third-class mail will remain at 1% cents
for qualified nonprofit mailers. After
January 6, though, the so-called circular
rate will be nine cents per pound, and
the rate for books, catalogues, etc. will
be six cents per pound. As before, the
preferential pound rate for nonprofit
organizations is half the regular rate.

) THEME OF THE 53RD ANNIVERSARY of
the Boy Scouts of America, to be ob-
served during Boy Scout Week, Febru-
ary 7 through 13, is “Strengthen Amer-
ica . . . Be Prepared, Be Fit.”

) THE 1963 ANNUAL CONFERENCE of
Recreation Therapists will be held at
Oklahoma Center for Continuing Edu-
cation, Norman, Oklahoma, April 8 to
12, 1963. Mrs. Lois Timmins, Timber-

lawn Psychiatric Center, PO. Box 1769,
Dallas 21, Texas, is Program Chairman.

P THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONVEN-
TION of Christian Camp and Confcrence
Association is scheduled for March 26
to 29 at George Williams College Camp,
Williams Bay, Wisconsin. “The pur-
pose of the convention,” states Chair-
man Harvey C. Chrouser, “is to help
camps and conferences strengthen their
spiritual impact.” Cost for the entire
program is $35. All who wish to regis-
ter may do so by sending a $5 registra-
tion fee to Edward Ouland, Registrar,
PO. Box 81, Wheaton, Illinois.

) FOR THE FIRST TIME in thirteen years,
the number of juvenile delinquency
cases coming before juvenile courts has
shown a slight drop, announces Mrs.
Katherine B. Oettinger of the US. Chil-
dren’s Bureau, Health, Education and
Welfare. “Our figures for 1961,” she
said, “show a one percent drOp, nation-
wide, in thc number of these cases com-
ing before the courts in a year when the
child population was increasing by
three percent.”

“This data certainly gives us no room
for complacency. We can’t, by any
means, be sure that we have turned the
corner so far as preventing and control-
ling juvenile delinquency is concerned.
What we can hope is that data for next
year, which will reflect the first full cal-
endar year of the operation of the Pres-
ident’s Committee on Juvenile Delin-
quency and Youth Crime, will show a
positive breakway from past patterns.”

) LICENSED SPORT FISHERMEN during
1961 reached a total of 19,394,177 and
licensed hunters reached a total of 11,-
798,890, according to thc United States
Department of the Interior. These to-

tals represent the number of licenses
purchased.

) Goon JUNIOR CITIZENS are offered in-
creased scholarship funds through the
Junior Citizen Program of the Boys’
Clubs of America. Some 620 Boys Clubs
throughout the country will now be eli-
gible to compete for sixteen national,
regional, and sectional scholarships.
Participants in this project, also known
as the “Boy of the Year” competition,
are judged on the amount and quality of
service to their home, church, school,
community and Boys’ Clubs.

Grants from the fund, established by
the Reader’s Digest Foundation, will be
made annually in the amount of $1,000
to the national winner, $200 to each of
seven regional winners, and $100 to
each of eight scctional winners. Schol-
arship awards will be announced during
National Boys’ Club Week, March 31-
April 6. The national winner will also
spend a week in New York City and
Washington, D.C. where he will take
part in newspaper, radio, and television
interviews and meet with various gov-
ernment leaders.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

 

} AN ESTIMATE of total U.S. consumer
purchases of sporting goods for the year
1962 is $2,373,800,000, according to a
statistical research study prepared by
economist Richard Snyder for the Na-
tional Sporting Goods Association (see
RECREATION, December 1962, Page
493), 23 East Jackson Boulevard, Chi-
cago 4, Illinois. In it, they state: “In
this report we present the largest splash
of mctropolitan area data relating to
Sporting goods sales ever to appear in
our series of market studies for this in-
dustry. During the past several years
some twenty markets have becn added
to the metropolitan area list in conform-
ity with various economic critcria es-
tablished by the United States Census
Bureau, while there has been at least
one deletion from the list published in
1959. There are now a total of 215 such
areas. Our estimates of total Sporting
goods applying to the year 1962 cover
210 of these areas. The sporting goods

10

sales estimates for these areas are set
forth in a very interesting table itemiz-
ing total sales and giving the sales po-
tential of each city. The report has re-
cently been published and is available
from the National Sporting Goods Asso-
ciation for fifteen dollars.

Walter L. Scott, superintendent of
recreation in Long Beach, California,
sends us a clipping from the Los An-
geles Times of December 10, 1962,
which accounts for some of these Star-
tling figures, with headlines stating,
“State Crazy Over Sports to Tune of
Billion a Year.” Local surveys of sport-
ing goods equipment in that state have
bcen showing “a yearly five percent in-
crease in almost every field of activity,
well above the population growth.”

b FOR THE FIRST TIME, five million vis-
its in one year have been chalked up by
a national park. A National Park Serv-
ice oHicial has announced this many
visits to Great Smoky Mountains Na-
tional Park, on the North Carolina side.
This represents an expansion of visits

to the park from a total of 2,322,152 in
1951.

b A NEw PUBLICATION, Your Retire-
ment, has just been published by the In-
stitute of Life Insurance, 488 Madison
Avenue, New York 22, and is offered to
the readers of RECREATION free of
charge. (In requesting this, refer to
Dept. R.) This has been planned to be
useful in taking stock of assets and plan-
ning the best use of them in a new pat-
tern of living.

In addition, the institute launched a
new quarterly publication in Septem-
ber, Senior Security Feature Service,
which is to include data on health insur-
ance, retirement, aging, family money
management, and other topics of inter-
est to older people. For further infor-
mation, write to Paul M. Giddings, Edi-
tor, Scnior Security, at the institute.

) A NEW RETIREMENT COURSE is Offered
by the Evening College of Washburn
University, Topeka, Kansas, in coopera-
tion with the Division of Services for
the Aging and the Shawnee County
Mental Health Association. Title of the
course is, “Toward Successful Retire-
ment.” For information, write James
M. Young, Director.

) THE TIIIRD OBSERVANCE of Children’s
Art Month will be held in March 1963.
Community and youth group leaders
and educators can obtain Children’s Art
Month material, including a paper
strcamer carrying the slogan, “Art is
Everywhere,” from the Crayon, Water
Color and Craft Institute, Inc., 420 Lex-
ington Avenue, New York 17. It is re-

quested that a large, self-addressed,
stamped envelope be sent to facilitate
mailing.

A. “Wink” Tapply, New Hampshire
representative for the NRA, has an ab-
sorbing collection of mimeographed
program sheets available to recreation

use more boats in 1962 than in 1961,
the Outboard Boating Club of America
and the National Association of Engine
and Boat Manufacturers declared in

In their new report, Boating—1962,
CBC and NAEBM estimated that 37,-
340,000 persons went boating in 1962
011 a Inore-than-casual basis, a million
and a half more than in 1961.

Retail expenditures on boating in
1962 were up $166,000,000 over 1961,
according to the joint report. An esti-
mated S2,506,000 was spent for new and
used boats, motors, trailers, accessories,
fuel, insurance, docking, launching,
storage, maintenance, and repairs dur-
ing 1962. The associations placed the
number of pleasure craft in use on the

nation’s waterways in 1962 at 7,468,-
000. The 1961 total was 7,175,000.

) MOTOR VEHICLE TRAVEL in the United
States in 1961 totaled 737,500,000,000
vehiclc-miles, an increase of 2.6 per-
cent over travel in 1960, according to
figures released recently by the U.S.
Bureau of Public Roads. Total travel
for 1962, based on information for the
first ten months of the year, is estimated
at 767,000,000,000 vehicle-milcs, a four
percent increase over 1961. Passenger

CHARLES K. BRIGHTBILL

IT IS RISKY to speculate about the fu-
ture in a fast-moving world, but we
can be reasonably certain about some
things. As John Diebold (the man who
coined the word automation) said, we
must prepare to live in a world in which
the only certainty is change and where
leisure is at the core, rather than the
fringe, of life. Now, I doubt that my observations will leave
you with imperial gallons of wisdom. But if you say, “Prove
to me that these things will come to pass,” I have only to re-
ply, “Prove to me that they will not.” I am really not wor-
ried, because somehow we always seem to believe the most
in the things we know the least about! Assuming that men
and nations will live in peace, the overriding factors which
will influence the development of our local parks and rec-
reation systems are these:

There will be more people and for many of them earning
a living will be only a part-time job. They will have more
leisure whether they want it or not, and many will be ill pre-
pared to use it. People will be healthier, live longer, and
have more to spend. They will be better informed, more
sophisticated, and more highly educated. Their personal
values will be put to the extreme test.

People will have to find in their leisure many of the sat-
isfactions they previously found in their work. Leisure will
have to be used for ends beyond being entertained, being
amused, and being comfortable. Somehow it will need to
be used for self-fulfillment, for physical and intellectual in-
volvement, for creative and cultural deveIOpment. As N or-
man Cousins said, if it were only a matter of teaching a
person a hobby, the task would be easy. But we have to build
a new kind of nianll

The concept of parks and recreation will broaden. Their
relation to the shaping of personality, to physiological and
psychological development and as a means of helping the
individual adapt to his changing environment will become
better understood. We either adapt to our environment or
we don’t survive. Our oases of nature in urban life—our
parks—will become increasingly vital in this respect.

Urbanization will continue but the design of tomorrow’s
city will place man’s needs—air, light, and space—ahead of
the machine’s convenience, including the automobile. Re-
melnber, where the population is densest, industry and pro-
duction the greatest, and living the most highly developed,
there will be the most enforced idleness. As population and
congestion increase, a greater premium will be placed upon
the opportunity for a moment of contemplation, for privacy,
for solitude, for reducing pressures to be always “on the go”
——to achieve the leisurely.

Our parks, forests, and outdoor recreation areas will hold
an increasingly important place in the international pattern.
This trend is already evident in the stepped-up volume in

reation and Municipal Park Administration at the Univer-
sity of Illinois in U rbana.

travel, in the growing similarity of the leisure habits of the
pe0ple of different nations, and in the new organizations
with concern for international park and recreation affairs.
In the future there will be more attention given to helping
the individual help himself in his leisure. This will mean
the development of leisure interests and skills during the
“growing-up” years. There will be a larger need for the
trained, available, competent amateur. The volunteer will
supplement the professional in larger numbers.

THE PUBLIC will support the effort to plan, develop, use,
protect, and conserve land and water areas in the public
domain for leisure purposes. Patterns will develop for the
using of these lands recreationally, but in ways which will
best conserve and protect them. \Ve will learn more about
what kinds of soils are best suited to certain kinds of uses.
how to get more conservation, economic, and recreation
mileage out of our natural resources. We may rotate park
uses as we have rotated crops. The things which threaten
our national and state public lands and waters—overgraz-
ing, soil erosion, range fires, lack of land retirement, absence
of reforestation and proper wildlife management. unfavor-
able weather conditions, industrial pollution. and over-ex-
tended industrial and population use—-will be better con-
trolled.

There will be gains in research. It will move out of the
survey-questionnaire-inventory stage and into trying to dis-
cover what happens to people when they engage in various
forms of recreation. llescarch will first be directed toward
people’s leisure habits, then to observing and assessing the
behavioral aSpects. The planner, landscape architect, engi-
neer conservationist, forester, horticulturist, land economist.
agronomist, geographer, soils expert, water specialist, edu-
cator, and recreator will engage in team research. Methods
and techniques best suited for research in this field will have
to be tested and validated. From these investigations will
emerge the body of knowledge. the principles and concepts.
and, finally, the policies npon which the future of parks and
recreation will be determined and from which they will
advance.

These things translate themselves into “Specifics.” What
are some of them?

T oday’s pace is such tha-

“Stop th

RELREATION

Consolidation. We are likely to see more municipal and
district park and recreation consolidation in the future.
This is so for several reasons. First, the pressures of urban
living underline the need for leisure experiences in the out-
of-doors. Although the penetrating highway and other re-
cent forms of encroachment in our parks would make it
appear otherwise, municipal park acreage will increase. We
may be nearing the day when minimum Space standards for
parks in areas of high population density may have to be
set by law. There will be more of a premium on the kind
of life which will enable us to maintain our individuality
in a conforming world and which allows us to seek self-
expression and beauty in their most natural forms. This
latter view does not separate recreation and parks. It brings
them together. A democracy must always take its strength
from its pe0ple, and pe0ple, as always, must take their
strength from the land. Finally, increasing competition for
the tax dollar will bring about mergers of local public rec-
1'eation and park systems. Dollars drained off for defense,
Space eXploration, experimentation in medicine and science,
and countless social services are prelude to getting higher
returns from our park and recreation tax dollars.

This prediction is huttressed by developments in the last
two decades. Between 1940 and 1961 the number of re-
porting local, public recreation authorities which administer
recreation as a single function jumped from 324- to 949;
those administered in connection with schools increased
from 186 to 274; and those administering recreation in con-
nection with parks sky-rocketed from 293 to 1,009. In my
own state. Illinois, we have 170 fiscally independent park
districts. Three of every four local public recreation systems
in Illinois are managed by park authorities.

The Illinois State Legislature in its last session authorized

A LOOK
INTO

THE FUTURE

the merging of municipal recreation systems and park dis.
tricts. The Illinois Park District Code has for some time
provided for levying of a half-mill tax for recreation, beyond
the one-and-a-half mills for corporate needs. There are at
present forty-seven park districts in Illinois which are levy-
ing recreation taxes beyond taxes for park maintenance. The
recently passed legislation not only permits mergers under
certain circumstances, but actually, for the first time, makes
it possible for a community to establish a park-recreation
agency in a single referendum, including the passing of the
recreation tax simultaneously with the corporate tax for
park purposes.

Change in Services. We will see a change in local public
recreation services. There will be less emphasis on the highly
organized, formal, routinely supervised program and more
attention given to providing the Opportunities and, then,
mainly those things which pe0ple cannot provide for them-
selves or which can be better provided by government. As
the schools, and families with increased purchasing power,
help sharpen the interests and skills of leisure, we shall
achieve better balance in park and recreation services.

The local authority will engage itself more in planning,
creating, and providing the opportunities—for those who
want action, but also for those who prefer solitude. As one
wag put it, we’ll be against the extreme in everything—the

RELATIONSHIPS

Summary of opinionnaire results prepared by joint study committee

An account of the steps tahen by the Boards of the Amer-
ican Recreation Society and the National Recreation Asso—
ciation to develop cooperative relationships between. the two
organizations appeared in the November 1962 issue of REC-
REATION. I t inchrded a reference to the opinionnaire sent the
memberships of both organizations, listed the four specific
alternatives on which members were requested to indicate
their preferences, and recorded a summary of the voting.
The following article presents in more detail the results of
the survey.

STRONG DESIRE for a complete merger of the American
A Recreation Society and the National Recreation Asso-

ciation or for a closcr structural relationship between
them was evidenced in the results of the opinionnaire dis-
tributed to members of the two organizations in the spring
of 1962. The 2,837 replies represented a 28 percent return
from the mailing of 10,250 forms. N RA members respond-
ing number 2,205; ARS members, 1,724. Of these groups,
1,171 were members of both organizations. The afiiliation
of seventy-nine respondents was not identified. The alterna-
tives presented on the opinionnaire may be summarized as

follows:
,.

A. A complete merger into a single organization.

B. A formal perlnanent structural relationship.

C. A continuation of the present relationships.

D. Two separate and independent organizations.

E. Other arrangements.
These alternatives when referred to in this article are desig-
nated as “merger.” “federation.” “agreements.” “
and “other,” respectively.

The completed opinionnaires were mailed to the secretary
of the Joint Committee, Graham Skea, director of recrea-
tion in East Orange. New Jersey, who after recording them
turned them over to the NRA Research Department for de-
tailed analysis. In making the tabulation, where the aflilia-
tion was not specified. but the signature was legible. the
proper membership was assigned from ARS and NRA rec-
ords. No attempt was made to check the accuracy of mem-
bership statements made by the respondents. “there two

alternatives were checked without explanation, the first was

separate,”

assumed to be the first choice. In only two or three cases
were duplicate returns identified. In a very few instances
where a comment beside the alternative checked made it
obvious that the respondent intended another arrangement,
the vote was reclassified. A summary of the 2.837 prefer-
ences recorded indicates that the votes were divided as fol-
lows among the five alternatives:

Separate 55 t .635
Other 58 2.0%

 

A detailed breakdown of the voting by states and n1c1nhcr-
ship type appears in the accompanying table. It indicates
that approximately two-thirds of the members of both the.
ARS and NRA who returned the opinionnaire expressed a
preference for a complete merger. About a quarter of the
other voting members of the two organizations favor a for-
mal permanent structural rclationship betwecn them. Com-
parativer few wished the status quo to be continued. Only
two percent wish the organizations to go their separate in-
dependent ways.

Signifieant Comments. The interest in ARS-NRA rela-
tionships 011 the part of their members was revealed by the
fact that more than a quarter of the respondents submitted
comments in addition to indicating their preference for one
of the plans. The comments varied in length from a few
words to dissertations. Many were expressions of apprecia-
tion for the opportunity to voice an opinion or approval of
the inquiry; others were reasons for a given preference or
suggestions for implementing the action supported. As might
be expected, specific proposals for action were varied, and
in some cases indicated extreme difTerences of opinion. An
analysis of significant comment follows.

“Merger” Supporters. This group, comprising 66 per-
cent of the total respondents, expressed much enthusiasm
over the possibility of a complete merger. Replies like “De-

RECREATION

.lighted,” “This Is a Must,” “Three Cheers,” “Merger the
)nly Way,” and “Keep Up the Good Work” are typical.
“United We Stand” and “In Union There is Strength” ap-
-)eared on scores of blanks. The importance attached to a
nerger is illustrated by the following words of a nationally
:nown recreation executive who has held positions of the
lighest importance in both ARSand NRA: “The accomplish-
nent of A (Complete merger and unification) would be the
greatest event since the initial organization of the National
Recreation Association more than half a century ago.”

Many respondents felt the merger was long overdue; oth-
ars that it should be put into effect at the earliest possible
:late. A very few urged caution and suggested the merger
would need to be achieved in stages or might take several
years to accomplish. Several offered to help in any way in
bringing it about.

,Reasons for Merger. The argument for a merger most
frequently mentioned was the added strength unification
would give to the recreation movement as a whole and to
recreation as a profession. Others cited were the elimination
of overlapping services and duplication of materials, the ad-
vantage of a single magazine, and the resulting economies
for the two organizations and their membership. Many felt
that, since the ARS and NRA have so much in common, com-
plete unity of philosophy and purpose is possible and would
eliminate confusion and divided loyalties among professional
and lay leaders. This would make for better public relations,
enlist stronger financial support, and improve the recreation
image in the eyes of the public.

Respondents believe that, with expanding leisure and the
great opportunity provided by the Kennedy Administration’s
interest in recreation, no time or effort should be expended
in competition or petty bickering. Available professional
talent and lay leadership can be used to greater advantage,
standards can be raised, more services can be provided to
members, and the public can be better served by a unified
recreation organization in which professionals and laymen
work toward a common goal. These advantages were re-
iterated over and over again, and organizations were cited
as examples of effective mergers.

The New Agency. Relatively few respondents suggested
a name for the combined agency or the adjustments that
should be made in the NRA as presently constituted. Among
the many names suggested were both the National Recrea-
tion Association and the American Recreation Society, the
former most frequently. Reasons cited repeatedly in favor
of retaining the NRA name were that the NRA is older, bet-
ter known, has an established magazine, greater financial
resources, and a headquarters building. These were recog-
nized as important assets to the success of the new organ-

- ization.

Since the returns were submitted primarily by profes-
sionals, many were naturally concerned that their influence
and status should not be submerged in a combined organ-
ization that might be dominated by a lay group. Several
warned, however, that nothing should be done to weaken
the fund-raising prcstige and ability of the present NRA

l

The opinion was expressed repeatedly that the aims and
objectives of both ARS and NRA should be considered and
protected in the merger and that the contribution of both
laymen and professionals to the success of the organization
and movement should be assured by providing opportunity
for both to share in its control and operation. A very few
insisted that the professionals should be in control.

Some members would be willing to pay increased dues to
support a merged organization, while others favored uni-
fication only if the combined dues were lower than the total
amount now paid by members of both ARS and NRA. Loca-
tion of the hcadquarters of the unified organization was
rarely mentioncd, but several referred to the NRA building
as an asset, and many apparently assume it would house the
new agency.

It was apparent to many that difficult problems would be

faced in accomplishing the merger, but many expressed con-
fidence that these could be solved by the organizations”
leaders. Most felt they did not have sufficient information
to provide the basis for making specific proposals. Among
the considerable number offered, however, the creation of a
professional division or department within the NRA was
most frequently presented, though in various ways. Specific
proposals were that the ARS should function as an NRA
department; that it becomes a chapter, section, or profes-
sional division; that it have a professional membership
which should select a number of representatives to the Board
of Directors, which would include both lay and professional
members; and that professionals be assigned active leader-
ship in various phases of the program. Several respondents
believe that state and local chapters should retain their iden-
tity and national affiliation; others urged that special sec-
tions be created for the armed forces, hospital. industrial,
and other personnel groups. Many proposals were too de-
tailed to be recorded here, but all were submitted to the
Joint Committee.
“Federation” Supporters. The group favoring a federa-
tion plan, representing 24.1 percent of the total returns, ap-
peared on the whole to be better informed as to the differ-
ences between ARS and NRA than those who favored a
complete merger. Several comments gave evidence of a strong
personal loyalty to either the ARS or the NRA. This group
believes that each organization has an important and dis- -
tinct service to perform and that each can achieve its objec-
tives better if separate identities are maintained. Many of
the reasons given for favoring a formal and permanent struc-
tural relation between ARS and NRA are similar to those
offered by the advocates of a merger. Among them are the
elimination of duplication, competition, and conflict; a re-
duction in the number of meetings; possible joint projects;
and a united front in dealing wilh problems of national sig-
nificance. Comments by advocates of this plan indicate that
the persons favoring it may be divided into three somewhat
equal groups that hold the following opinions:

1. A unified organization is most desirable, but federation
should be considered as a necessary interim step towards its
ultimate achievement.

2. A single organization would be desirable, but it would

be impossible to achieve a successful mergcr.

ANUARY, 1963 15

3. It is highly desirable that there be two distinct, but
federated, organizations in the recreation field.

Some felt that each group must be free to pursue its own
objectives and that separate identity helps keep both organ-
izations on the alert. A few fear that a merger would affect
adversely the fund-raising powers of the NRA; that the ABS
would have a subordinate status in a single organization;
that freedom of the professionals to promote their ideas
might be stified; or that a monopoly might be created. The
group that believes it desirable, but not practicable, to merge
the ABS and the NRA cited the record of their differences
on major issues; their different methods of financial support;
the “professional” function of one as contrasted with the
“service” function of the other; the basic difference in the
membership and control; and possible opposition to the
elimination of one or both names or agencies. A consider-
able number of respondents expressed the belief that appli-
cation of the federation plan would demonstrate the advan-
tages and practicality of a structural relationship; would
provide the basis for determining the feasibility of ultimate
unification; and would therefore serve as an interim step
toward this objective.

In general, the comments reflected the belief that the NRA
should continue to be primarily a service agency, although
some propose it also be responsible for training and other
functions; that the ARS should be concerned with profes-
sional matters including the development of standards. Two
comments on research illustrate extreme differences of Opin-
ion as to function: “Thc ARS with advice given to them
from qualified persons in the NRA should be responsible

for every item that is in the remotest way connected with
research,” and “The name of the NRA should be changed to

the ‘National Recreation Research Center’.”

Federation with other professional organizations, or a
complete merger of AIPE and ARS, were suggested by sev-
eral, although a number proposed that each keep its iden-
tity, but cooperate with NRA 011 confercnces, legislation, and
other appropriate matters. chardless of their reasons for
supporting federation, respondents were in almost unani-
mous agreement that some form of joint coordinating board
would greatly benefit both organizations, as well as the
movement. Supporting this Opinion were such comments as
“Cooperation in certain areas is mandatory,” “Communica-
tion between the two agencies is vital and essential,” and
“The two organizations’ efforts must be coordinated.”

Supporters of “Agreement.” A substantial numhcr of
the 169 respondents (six percent of the total) who favor a
continuation of the status quo indicated that it should be
considered an interim plan. They hope that in view of the
success in cooperation on the annual National Recreation
Congress, additional areas of joint action will be developed
with a view toward achieving federation or merger within
a period of years. On the other hand, those voting for the
status quo as a permanent arrangement emphasized the basic
differences between the roles of a professional and a service
organization and saw many disadvantages in attempting to
combine them. The dangers of a monopoly were pointed out,
as well as the right of the professional body to act independ-

16

ently, and the fact that a certain amount of competition
makes for a healthy situation.

Supporters of “Separation.” Most of the eighteen in
this relatively small group of fifty-five persons who believe
the two organizations should go their separate and inde-
pendent ways believe both organizations serve a useful pur-
pose and see no reason why they should not function inde-
pendently. Others qualified their votes by stating that
complete separation should not preclude c00peration on
special projects, which would indicate that perhaps they
should be classified in the preceding group. A few fear
that because of divergent purposes of the NRA and ABS
and the differences of opinion of their members, a merger
might result in internal friction and disagreements; there-
fore, they favor complete separation. As one executive said,
“To water down primary objectives of two organizations to
achieve an idealistic goal would seem, in effect, to produce
a built-in dilemma and smacks of hypocrisy.”

The “Other” Vote. Nearly half of the fifty-eight respon-
dents in this small grOUp who favor another type of plan
stated they did not have enough information to justify cast-
ing a vote, and therefore did not indicate their preference.
As might be expected, the proposals varied widely. The
need for establishing high qualifications for membership
in the ARS was mentioned several times. A few proposed
that the ARS be combined with the other professional groups
or with the AIPE only, either as a preliminary step to a
merger with the NRA or as a means of strengthening the
ARS as a separate organization.

Conclusion. Most respondents credited both organizations
for their contributions to the field of recreation. Only a
few people took the Opportunity to voice severe criticism of
individuals, policies, or published material. Some expressed
the hope that past disagreements be forgotten.

The multiplicity of conferences and organizations in the
recreation and parks field apparently is a growing burden
to many respondents who find it difficult to explain the situ-
ation to authorities, taxpayers, and the gcneral public. This
fact seemed to influence many who favored a total or partial
merger. There seems to be considerable sentiment in favor
of combining the American Institute of Park Executivcs with
the American Recreation Society and support for a move
to combine all professional recreation and park organiza-
tions either in a single professional agency or as part of a
completely unificd recreation organization including NRA.

No attempt was made to tahulate numerically the com-
ments and suggestions made by the supporters of each al-
ternative plan. Several of the respondents in each category
checked more than one alternative, some indicating first and
second choices. Many who voted for “Federation” exprcssed
hope for a complete ultimate merger, and likewise some who
favored “Agreement” want additional cooperative ventures
established. A few who checked “Other,” suggested arrange-
ments that might properly be considered as a merger or fed-
eration. Therefore, while the figures given in this statemcnt
are substantially correct, support for a closer relationship
between ARS and NRA is somewhat stronger than the tabu-
lation indicates.

EORGE D. BUTLER, director of research of the National
'8 Recreation Association, retired on December 14,
" 1962, after forty-three years of service with NRA.
lie is the author of four widely known standard works, In-
troduction to Community Recreation, Playgrounds: Their
Administration and Operation, Community Sports and Ath-
letics, and Recreation Areas—T heir Design and Equipment.
He also has written almost innumerable pamphlets, articles,
and other material on various phases of recreation organ-
ization and administration. ln cooperation with federal
agencies, he directed nation-wide studies of municipal parks
in 1930, 1935, and 1940, and he has been in charge for many
. years of the Association’s survey of community recreation
services, which now is conducted at five-year intervals, and
the results of which are published in the Recreation and Park
Yearbooks. He has served as chairman, secretary, or mem-
bcr of national committees concerned with such diversified
subjects as leadership standards, surfacing areas, youth fit-
ncss, outdoor swimming pools, training recreation workers,
and adult recreation buildings. In addition to heading NRA’s
Research Department, he was serving, at the time of his re-
tirement, as secretary of its National Advisory Committee
on Recreation Research and associate editor of RECREATION
' Magazine. He is known internationally as an expert in the
field of recreation.

Since there was no such thing as a college curriculum in
recreation when George Butler attended Yale University, his
attainment of the status of expert was entirely a “do-it-
yourself” project——-as was his attendance at Yale. The small
town of Seymour, Connecticut, where he was born and
raised, offered only limited education opportunities, and
private schools were out of the question for the Butler
children. However, young George had set his sights on
Yale, in spite of the academic and financial difficulties in
his way. A program of hard work—first, peddling papers,
mowing lawns, and shoveling snow; later, at more demand-

mour. Greek, for example, was not offered in Seylnour;
however, in his seven months at Mount Hermon, George
Butler mastered a two-year course in Greek with such notable
ability that his professor urged him to make instruction in
this language his career. The othcr courses needed were
stored in his mental filing cabinet with equal dispatch and
he went on to graduate from Yale with a degree in economics
and a Phi Beta Kappa key.

Not having decided on his field of work, he took a job
in Yale’s personnel placement bureau, but left a few months
later to join a volunteer group being formed for ambulance
service with the French Army in World War I. The fact that
he had never driven a car did not deter him from volunteer-
ing for this service, and his confidence was justified by the
fact that, after reading a manual on the operation of the
Model T Ford from cover to cover, he passed his driving
test with no difficulty.

After twelve months of service with the ambulance corps,
back in this country with a Croix de Guerre and a Fluent
command of the French language, he returned to the Yale
placement bureau, which seemed like a good vantage point
from which to survey the employment scene. Two interest-
ing opportunities presented themselves, one with a banking
firm and the other with the National Recreation Association.

GEORGE BUTLER had never heard of a playground, but his

home background had instilled in him a deep-rooted
tradition of service and he elected to join the staff of the
National Recreation Association. Fate took a hand at this
point—four days after he took up his duties, Rebecca Jones,
just graduated from Smith College, also came to work for
NRA. In 1921 Miss I ones became Mrs. Butler—a position
she has held ever since. The Butler family now includes two
sons, four grandsons, and three granddaughtcrs.

In addition to his professional recreation work, George
Butler has been influential in promoting thc excellent rec-
reation service provided by his home borough of Leonia,
New Jersey. He served on that comm unity’s rccreation com-
mission from its inception in 1946 until December 1962 and
has been its chairman as often as he would consent to hold

that office. When he resigned from the commission, sixty

tion out-of-doors at any given time. All
of us are being made aware of an in-
contravertible truth: Recreation will
have its place on the land. As much as anything else, rec-
reation use is pushing forward the concept of multiple-use
of the land. It demands reeognition and has brought multi-
ple-use up from a vague term used by conservationists to a
reality which all of us are encountering more and more often.
Multiple-use, including recreation use, must, of necessity,
force its way onto thosc few remaining state, fedcral, and
other public lands where it is not yct quite acceptablc.

However. multiple-use is only a partial solution to the
dilemma of more recreation on less land. Federal and state
agencies must all outdistance the stcamroller, must satisfy
very real public needs. Too often we may see or sense solu-
tions but be barred by apathy on the part of the very people
who urge us to move. Part of this apathy may eome from
lack of knowledge of opportunities which exist.

In our Western states the national land reserve presents
a good many opportunities. It is the intention of the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management to do all within its power to
help states take advantage of available spaec. Secretary of
the Interior Stewart Udall has said that “. . . . the provision
of open spaces for outdoor recreation is now considcred one

 

of the most important objectives of management of thc 11a-
tional land reserve.”

Corps days, the BLM had funds to build a multiple-purpose

road in a nontimbered area. This was in the Steens Moun-
tains in Oregon. The BLM is now expanding road building
in other states. In Arizona, a twenty-two-mile access road
is just being completed. There has been very substantial
progress in working out arrangements with state agencies
concerning the managcment of wildlife. Wildlife and rec-
reation spccialists are being employed by the bureau. New
regulations are serving to coordinate land administration
with local needs. Other. smaller signs of progress include a
project to make accurate maps of BLM lands availahle to
local agencies and thc public. There is an embryonie pro-
gram to post suitable information signs and to provide other
information to facilitate public use.

BLM people are instructed to work closely with local gov-
ermnents in locating specific recreation sites on the national
land reserve, and to work out long-range devclopment plans
in relation to outdoor recreation and other values. 'So far,
the hureau has identified over four thousand sites as suit-
able for intensive recreation use and for the installation of
facilities. The purpose is to see that such areas evcntually
receivc effective management as recreation sites—either by
federal, statc, county, or municipal agcnls.

_.\

ET there are obstacles. C. R. Cutermuth recently said,

“The most formidable ohstacle facing the efforts to
turn the BLM from the past toward the future is that its
program stems from antiquated laws and outmoded philoso-
phies." The actions of recent months testify that philoso-
phies within the department and the BLM are in step with
the times. Unfortunately, the laws are not.

Under present circumstanccs, then, the main overall re-
sponsibility of BLM remains that of providing proper tenurc
arrangements for public lands with recreation potential.
Sites with important multiple-usc values remain in fedcral
ownership with the hope that necessary recreation develop-
ments will be provided eventually. Sites without significant
multiple-use values and with potential for local recreation
are available to local agencies under the Recreation and

RECREATIorg

Public Purposes Act. This situation places primary respon-
sibility on state and local agencies to establish public rec~
reation areas for local use and to provide the facilities. There
is a responsibility to retain lands which provide key access
to present or potential recreation areas.

The problems faced by BLM are not strangers to state
land and resource management agencies. Archaic laws,
ancient enabling acts, contradictory public attitudes, and
lack of operating funds plague many. This presents an oppor~
tunity which, except for public education, is largely out of
our hands: If local entities want full material assistance, if
they want support in developing recreation opportunity on
the national land reserve and on state-owned lands, then they
will do well to help untangle the halter knot that keeps us
tied to the gatepost. We need to search out those things
which prevent a full program, which hinder cooperation and
joint effort in the management of public lands. Among this
tangle of time-generated debris there is one particular im-
pediment which is quite popular during even-numbered
years. Converting of conservation issues to petty political
purposes will do nothing to get us closer to the goal.

There is, at the moment, wasted opportunity. There are
many ways of meeting public recreation needs. Several are
spelled out for the BLM and local agencies by law and regu-
lation. However, more important than those in writing is
the one that comes from within. It is a fuel mixture of co-
operation, imagination, initiative, and determination. The
road to accomplishment may be laid out and paved with
policy directives and law. But how far and fast we travel
that road is determined by how much fuel we get into the
carburetor and, as Secretary Udall has said, “. . . by how
well all of us, as managers of public resources and lands,
face decisions that test our balance and judgment as never
before. It is a task that will not be done right without care-
fully coordinated efforts at all levels of government.”

WITH determination and coordination as a starting point,
there are several means by which BLM can help states,

I ANUARY, 1963

counties, and towns along the road toward adequate recrea-
tion development. These are through permits, classification,
transfer, withdrawal, cooperative agreemcnts, exchange,
selection, lease, sale, and preservation of access. Direct, con-
tinued administration of classified lands by BLM may appear
contradictory at first glance, but it can open a gate which
otherwise might be firmly closed. If any area has good po-
tential for other uses—and especially if those other uses are
established—fear and resistance may be the logical response
to any proposals to change ownership. Multiple-use is a firm
and established part of BLM administration. It is assumed
that it will continue to be so. Thus, continued federal ad-
ministration serves to assure full resource values to users
and to the public in general.

Examples include the Steens Mountains area mentioned
earlier. The Warner Valley area in Lake County, Oregon,
is another. There, last year, some seventy-five thousand
acres were designated for development programs. They will
be managed under a program of balanced use for livestock
grazing, watershed protection, wildlife conservation, and
recreation. Similarly, twenty thousand acres of national
land reserve along the upper Deschutes River have been
identified as a public land management area. Locally spon- ,
sored and maintained facilities can serve to enhance public
use and enjoyment of such areas.

A recent example of retention in federal owuership was
the transfer of over fifteen thousand acres of national land
reserve to Saguaro National Monument near Tucson—an
area NOT classified for multiple use but with primary values
for recreation on a national level. Concurrently, some seven
thousand acres were leased to Pima County for devclopmcnt
as a local recreation area.

The Saguaro Monument action is closely allied in pur-
pose to withdrawal. Areas with specific historical, scientific,
or natural feature values may be withdrawn from entry in
order to protect them from appropriation or damage. Such
action was necessary in Arizona early this year to protect
outstanding hieroglyphics in the Painted Rocks Mountains.
The Painted Rocks area is being protected by BLM until the

19

state of Arizona, presently handicapped by legal provisions,
is able to take over.

There is a definite and immediate need for states to take
cognizance of such sites and to take the initiative in request-
ing that they be protected by withdrawal until they can be
transferred under provisions of the Recreation and Public
Purposes Act. It is a sad mark against American society to
have to say that, unless such protection is given, we are going
to lose valuable sites through wanton destruction.

COOPERATION is explicit in all BLM-local actions. But co-
Operation in itself is also a formal means of achieving
part of the outdoor recreation goal on the national land
reserve. In 1961 Secretary Udall formally designated the
ninety-two-square-nlile Caliente area in south-central Cali-
fornia as a Federal-State Cooperative Land and Wildlife
Management area. Under agreement provisions, it is ad-
ministered by the BLM in cooperation with the US. Fish
and Wildlife Service and the state of California. Since
Caliente, several other areas in that state have been brought
under the same type of agreement. Action is underway
in Arizona and other states to set up similar multiple-use
areas. Under thesc agreements, the Department of Interior
and the state concerned will develop the wildlife, recreation
and other resources including uses already established.
Land exchange is another method by which state and
local entities may p'rovidc recrcation areas. Because of the
availability of other methods, and bccause of legal and
management requirements, land exchange is not likely to
play a large part in recreation development. BLM, as a
national agency, is not in a position to make unequal ex-
changes for purely local or limited benefit. Special legisla-
tion may even be indicated when certain types of three-way
exchanges are proposed. But exchange can be effectivc, as
it was when recreation lands along the Rogue River in Ore-
gon were exchanged to Jackson County for timber lands.

TATE selection and tenure adjustments are other avenues
for cooperation. Where cxamination indicatcs that
tracts may best be developed or administered under other
ownerships, BLM can make tenure adjustments. Similar
ends may be achieved through statc selection in cases where
the public land account is still open. While lieu acreages
may not be large, they can be keys to development of prime
recreation areas. Imagination and fortitude can pay off.
The Port Townsend Historical Site on the Olympic Penin-
sula of Washington is a good example of the virtue of crea-
tive imagination. Without it, one of Washington’s foremost
historical sites might have been lost, a prime tourist attrac-
tion which includes thirty-three hundred feet of salt water
frontage, fireplaces. tables, a well, and, of course, an his-
torical edifice. Cinko Petrified Forest State Park, with a
mile of Columbia River frontage, and some thirty-five is-
lands in the San Juan group of Puget Sound are other ex-
amples of tenure adjustments made for the public benefit
in spite of human obstacles.
Still another method of improving recreation opportunity
is through full awareness of the need for access whether it
be to a few hundred yards of streambank or to a hunting

20

or scenic area of thousands of acres. Recent situations in
Oregon, in Colorado, and much of the West have increased
awareness of the need to make public areas available to the
public. Construction, exchange, selection, and many other
tools can be used in both state and federal efforts to open up
presently unavailable lands. The Walnut Creek-Hualpai
Mountain road in Arizona will open up seventy thousand

acres, the Steens Mountains Road, some fifty thousand.

The basis for a good many of the opportunities mentioned
is the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Despite the fact
that the original law is ncarly a half-century old, it is not
widely understood. Amendments in 1954 and again in 1959
made the law more workable. On July 7 last year, it became
truly effective. On that date Secretary Udall’s new pricing
schedule became operative. Under it, state and local gov-
ernments may lease recreation or other public purpose sites
for twenty-five cents an acre a year. They may purchase'
them at $2.50 an acre. The new schedule confirms the for-'
ward look in the Department of the Interior and the Bureau I
of Land Management. The philosophy is modern although I
many of the tools for putting it into effect are from the realm '
of antiquity.

Some indication of the importance of the new pricing
schedule can be found in sales and leases under the Act prior
to the schedule. During Fiscal Year 1961 just a few more
than five thousand acres were sold and some seven thousand I
leased. Then in September of 1961 BLM began issuing a
series of leases to Maricopa County in Arizona (see RECREA-
TION, June 1962). These leases covered ten times the amount
of land (seventy thousand acrcs) leased throughout the en-
tire national land reserve area during the previous fiscal
year. They were the first leases issued under the new sched-
ule and providc land for thc most comprehensive county I

regional parks set-up in the United States.

 

In Washington State, representatives of State Parks and ,
Recreation, the State Department of Natural Resources“
State Departmcnt of Game, BLM, and the National Park I
Service toured thirty areas which the BLM fclt had possi- ‘
bilities for recreation development. Somc wcre small. Some I
were large. Today, many of these are contributing to the 
economic and social well-being of the Northwest as prime :
recreation areas. Some werc transferrcd as historical sites
bccause of then prohibitive costs under other methods and
bccause thcy did havc historical values. Tenure adjustments, I
agreements and other means were used. The old tools are !
oftcn awkward and slow. However, with initiative, they can I
many timcs be made to servc the needs of the day.

A word of caution is rluc at this point: the departmcnt
can adjust its pricing schedules; it can inventory its lands;
it can even encouragc local agencies to act; but, unless there
is local response and initiative, there can be no action. No
land can be leased, no agrcements signed, no sales or trans-
fers of title made without local action. BLM can hold the
gate ajar. The new Bureau of Outdoor Recreation may soon
he able to open the gate a little wider. But they can’t lead
others through that gate. That is the responsibility of you
and your fellow citizens.

The need is obvious. And today is the time for action. #-

A moves into the field of big busi-
ness (an estimated two million
dollars this year), so public recreation
sports facilities such as ball diamonds,
tennis courts, and golf courses are in-
creasing more rapidly than the popula-
tion in many of today’s American cities,
according to the Recreation and Park
Yearbooks published by the National
Recreation Association. In 1960, when
the sporting goods industry entered the
mass-volume stage, the need for facili-
ties which could meet widely accepted
standards was being iilled by a rapidly
growing number of cities. The state-
ment that follows records an analysis of

In many cities such public facilities
are totally inadequate, and a study of
them would have little value. An analy-
sis of the facilities in cities comprising
the group of 25 percent that have the
most facilities in comparison with their
population, on the other hand, affords
an indication of the validity of the
standards. It also suggests at least the

to attain. All figures in the tables that

the years 1948, 1955, and 1960.

Another purpose served by this study
is to relate the extent to which the 25
percent “best” cities have achieved the
commonly accepted facility standards.
These call for a city to provide:

1 baseball diamond per 6,000
1 hole of golf per 3,000

1 softball diamond per 3,000

1 tennis court per 2,000

each of the eight population groups in
1960. In nearly every instance, the fig-
ures for the median and average are
strikingly similar. The table indicates
that, in the three p0pulation groups un-

in the three groups under 50,000, the
median city met the standard for soft-
ball diamonds, whereas in only the two
groups under 25,000 did either median
or average city exceed the tennis court
standard. It further shows that with

the fewer the facilities they provide in

TRENDS in the provision of the four

facility types in comparison with
population from 1948 to 1960 are indi-
cated by Table II, which records the
ratio in the median city of six popula-
tion groups for the years 19148, 1955,
and 1960. The table reflects a general
trend rather than an accurate change in
the situation, because it is not based
on data for identical cities. Further-
more. in the 1948 Yearbook, reports
were submitted by fewer park authori-
ties than in the other years, because
agencies did not qualify unless they pro-
vided a program under leadership or
operated a major facility under super-
vision. The 1955 and 1960 data, how-
ever, are comparable, although more
cities reported in 1960.

A marked increase in the provision
of facilities for baseball, golf, softball,
and tennis in cities of all sizes between
1948 and 1960 is indicated by the table.
The gain is especially evident between
1955 and 1960, when the p0pulation per
facility in the median city of each pop-
ulation group was much lower in the
case of all four facilities. By far the best
showing was made in cities under 25,-

Table Ill answers the question,
“What was the best showing made by
cities in each pOpuIation group in pro-
viding the four facility types in 1948,
1955, and 1960?” It is evident that at
least one city in each p0pulation group
meets the four standards except that no
city of .250,000 and over. provides the
baseball diamonds and tennis .courts

the national standard for each of the
four facility types.

The analysis of the Yearbook data
suggests two questions with reference
to the facility standards. One is whether
a single standard based on the ratio of

JANUARY, 1963

FIVE-YEAR RECREATION PLAN for
A the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune

in North Carolina involves use
of the general resources of the base as
well as community school properties.
The plan will serve both sexes. encour-
age family participation, and be a carry-
over of interests and skills developed in
school, encouraging self-leadership and
coordinating the various areas and peo-
ple on the base. A Tri-Command Plan-
ning Committee (representatives from
base, division, and force tr00ps) is de-
signing the plan. On the agenda are
nature walks, picnics, water sports, and
instruction in various skills.

Lejeune’s on-base dependent children
population includes 5,829 aged six years
and under; 2,394, seven to twelve years
of age; and 1,014 teenagers. Varying
the activities to meet the different age
groups constitutes one of the biggest
problems facing the youth community
activities director, Selwyn Orcutt. who
says, “We are now using recreation to
teach skills, coordinate people and com-
munities, combat delinquency, give in-
formation regarding the base to new
dependents, and give informational talks
at the centers in subjects such as fight-
ing fires. bodybuilding, and financing.”

The camp’s summer program served

1,405 children of personnel living on
and off the base. These ranged from the
first grade through the twelfth. Since
Camp Lejeune is situated on the New
River, it oiiers an excellent variety of
water sports for which 1,146 students
were enrolled. Besides all types of boat-
ing, swimming, and water skiing, the
youngsters were also able to sign up for
baton twirling, arts and crafts, first aid.
baby care, 'tennis, bowling, and ce-
ramics.

Another project of the youth activi-
ties department is the Teen Club at
Marston Pavilion which has a member-
ship of 270. The club is open to all
dependents from 8 to 12PM on Fri-
days and Saturdays and from 2 to 5PM
on Sunday. The teen program consists
of general activities; parties, such as
the reccnt Hawaiian Luau which drew
three hundrcd teens; and special events
such as the father-and-son pool tourna-
ment with twenty-four teams competing
for the championship. Community pro-
grams include bancl concerts given by
the division band, water sprays at each
community, community softball, and a
dependents’ swimming team of fifty
members which is now a member of the
South Eastern Carolina Swimming As-
sociation. #

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

 

Goodspeed Opera

Three years of planning by a group
of Connecticut citizens resulted in the
opening in September of Goodspeed
Opera House on the bank of the Con-
necticut River near East Haddam. More
than $500,000 was needed to restore the
building which for sixty years had been
used to store and garage state highway
machinery. Next summer there will be
an annual festival of music, including
commissioned Operas and presentations
of ballet, drama, and one-man shows.
The program has been entrusted to a
committee of stage professionals headed
by Jean Dalrymple, Broadway producer
and director of New York City’s Center
for Music and Drama. The theater seats
360 persons. Eventually there will be
boardwalks and a river marina.

Dig and Learn

Some interesting archeological dis-
coveries were unearthed in Statcn Is-
land, New York, by eighteen high-
school students, members of the Brook-
lyn Children’s Museum Archeological
Workshop. Indian arrowheads, pieces
of pottery, and traces of what is believed
to be an Indian firepit were turned up
by the students. Members of the muse-
um’s mineralogy and ornithology work-
shops are also making field trips to sup-
plement lecture and work sessions.

basement of the city hall, with orange
crates for files . . . We went upstairs for
one year, and then back to the base-
ment. When I was hired, I said some-
thing about being used to starting from
scratch and scrounging and someone
remarked, ‘Yes, but you don’t have the
Army and Navy back of you here to
scrounge on.” However, we had the

reation for Americans set the tone for
the establishment of the three new Na-
tional Seashore Areas, the new Bureau
of Outdoor Recreation, the President's
Council on Youth Fitness originally set
up under the Eisenhower administra-
tion, and the White House Conference
on Conser\-'ati(.m called in May 1962.

The President opens the baseball season with a good, enthusiastic throw.

 

How have the Kennedys as a family
group contributed to recreation in
America? Working through the Joseph
P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation, the family
has contributed monies to an array of
community centers, hospitals, guidance
centers, schools, homes for dependent
children, and research centers for re-
tarded children, mostly located in the
New England area. Several, however,
can be found as far west as Illinois and
California. Most of the facilities en-
dowed by the foundation bear the name
of Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy, J r., who died
in World War II.

Massachusetts is crammed with facili-
ties which the foundation has endowed:
the Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Memorial
Hospital in Brighton, the Joseph P. Ken-
nedy, Jr. ,Memorial Infirmary in East
Boston, the Nazareth Home for Boys in
Leicester, the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.
Memorial Youth Center in New Bed-
ford, and the Catholic Boys Guidance
Center in Boston.

The Kennedy Foundation donated
$150,000 toward the Guidance Center’s
modern school building. The building,
dedicated in 1957, includes a handsome
gym and other recreation rooms. At this
center, a recreation-work program is an
integral part of the treatment for emo-
tionally disturbed boys. Athletics,
games, shop, arts and crafts, and field
trips are scheduled in the program. The
gym filled a pressing need for these
youngsters who had to be content with
visiting a municipal gym for an hour
period twice weekly. Now, in their own
gym, they have tumbling, weightlifting,
boxing, basketball, handball, and vol-

leyball.

In Hyannis, Massachusetts, the Jo-
seph P. Kennedy, Jr. Memorial Skating
Centre offers the only ice skating rink 011
Cape Cod. The rink is administered by
the Barnstable Playground and Recrea-
tion Commission. The facility is actu-

companion building which serves as an
equipment room-warming house in the
winter. The building, which also con-
tains a snack bar and office space, is
used by Little League baseball teams
during the summer. The skating rink

toward construction of the center. The
center serves youth in the New Bedford
area. Dramatic productions, workshops.

and other sports are among the recrea-
tive activities. In addition to serving
the youth of high-school age, the center
offers programs which attract young
adults between the ages of twenty and
twenty-nine. This group adds several
activities to the roster which serves for
the younger group. They participate in
music appreciation, an annual award for
outstanding man and woman, mystery
rides, summer outings, a ski trip to New
Hampshire. The Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Public Welfare, the Catholic
Nurses’ Guild. and the Holy Family
High School use the facility for meet-
ings and sports events.

THREE FACILITIES in the New York
metr0politan area are financed by
the Kennedy Foundation: a community
center. a child-study center for mentally

retarded children, and a home for de-
pendent children. The Lt. Joseph P.

Kennedy J r. Memorial Community Cen-
ter in Manhattan is a large, impressive
building. It has a spacious arts-and-
crafts room, boxing arena, fencing area,
gym, lounges, office space, meeting
rooms, a rooftop recreation area, an
auditorium, an outside play area, and
a nursery. Membership cards, valid
from October to May, are issued to
youngsters who wish to participate in
the center’s programs. During July and
August, the center sponsors a day camp
using all of the facilities within the
building, with field trips to parks in New
York and New Jersey. The center makes
use of a swimming pool operated by the
New York City Park Department for
daily swims for its campers, who range
in age from seven to twelve years. Three
hundred children attend the day camp
each summer. The center, an affiliate
member of the National Recreation As-
sociation, has a staff of twenty-five, in-
cluding an arts-and-crafts instructor.
program director, athletics coach. The
program is broken down into afternoon
and evening sections which run from
3PM to 10PM. During the summer the
center operates from 9AM to 10PM.
Teenage activities are scheduled from
six o’clock to nine. A golden-age pro-
gram is also Operated. The excellent
variety of program activities includes
athletic teams, arts and crafts, cheering
squad, table games, hoxing, modern.
folk, and creative dancing, charm
classes, bingo, social dances, dramatics
and fencing. The marching band begun
recently provides free musical instruc-
tion to its members.

At the Kennedy Child Study Center,
also in, Manhattan, the initial invest-
ment of capital funds was contrihutcd
largely by Joseph P. Kennedy, former
ambassador to England and father of
the President. The largest source of
private support has been the Kennedy
Foundation in conjunction with the ef-

PREAD OUT over fifteen acres of re-

P. Kennedy, Jr. Home in the Bronx is
home for almost three hundred young-
sters aged six to eighteen. The children
are assigned to the home by the New
York City Department of Welfare and
the courts. They may remain there for
a short while or, in some cases, until
they can strike out on their own. A cot-
tage-counselor-sister system provides a
base for activities and family living.
0n the spacious grounds, there are a
baseball diamond, football field, tennis
courts, an inviting swimming pool, arts-

During the summer an off-campus “day
camp” takes a different group of chil-
dren each day to a nearby recreation
facility—beaches, parks, and other fa-
cilities within the larger community—to
give the youngsters a widened perspec-
tive of the world. Two staff members are
responsible for the day groups. This
approach of preparing youngsters from
the home for life in the community is
worked out as the children mature. As
elementary-school children, they attend
classes on campus, but as they graduate
into high school they attend school in
the community. These children are al-
lowed and encouraged to work after
school to prepare them for the future.
They are given curfews and can date off
campus. The home attempts to provide
a well—rounded living experience for the
youngsters who live there. It was Opened

RECREATION AREA STANDARDS

GEORGE D. BUTLER

HE NEED TO REVISE the standards for playgrounds and
I playfields developed early in the 1940’s by the Na-

tional Recreation Association was indicated by a
study conducted by the NRA Standards Committee in 1961
and 1962. Changes in the function of these two area types
during the past two decades called for an increase in their
space requirements, according to the results of the study.
The present-day standards, developed with the c00pera-
tion of national and local planning, park, and recreation au-
thorities, have been widely adopted throughout the United
States and have provided the basis for recommendations in
scores of long-range plans for municipal park and recreation
systems. They recognize the playground as the basic neigh-
borhood recreation area and the playfield as the type of area
serving a community or cluster of neighborhoods. Brief
descriptions of the standards follow:

The Neighborhood Playground. The neighborhood
playground is the chief outdoor play center for the children
of a residential neighborhood but also provides limited rec-
reation service for young people and adults. It is a real
neighborhood center where the whole family can come for
recreation and relaxation. The standard proposed that a
playground should he within a quarter to a half mile of
every home, depending primarily upon population density
of the neighborhood. It was pointed out that in a well-
planned neighborhood the best location for the playgrouan
is at or adjoining the elementary school site.

 

MR. BUTLER recently retired as director of research of the
National Recreation Association a [ter serving on its staff? [or

forty-three years. ( See also Page I 7.)

Results of study of neighborhood
and community areas

It was proposed that there be one acre of playground for
each eight hundred of the present and estimated future pop-
ulation of the city, with the size of playgrounds to vary
according to the neighborhood population, as follows:

Populallon of Nelghborhood Size of Playground Needed
2000 3.25 acres
3000 4.00 acres
4000 5.00 acres
5000 6.00 acres

Most of the following features were listed as essential:
corner for preschool children; apparatus area for older chil-
dren: open space for informal play; surfaccd area for court
games such as tennis, handball, paddlc tennis, shufllehoard,
volleyball; field for games such as softball and modified
soccer, touch football, mass games; area for storytelling.
crafts, dramatics, quiet games; sheltcr housc; wading pool;
corner for table games and other activities for older people;
landscape features. The space standard was for the recrea-
tion area only and did not include the school site. Land-
scape features were listed as an essential in the developmcnt,
but the standard did not provide for a portion of the play-
ground to be set aside as a neighborhood park.

The I’layfield. The playfield provides diversified facilities
primarily for young people and adults, but usually includes
a playground for the immediate neighborhood. The play-
field serves as an outdoor recreation center for community

field for at least every twenty thousand of the population,

the total amount of a city's playfield space to equal one acre
for each eight hundred of its present and estimated future
population.

According to the standards, most of the following features
should be provided: separate sports fields for men and for
women, for such games as baseball, football, field hockey.
soccer, softball; courts for tennis, boccie, horseshoes, shuffle-
board, roque, paddle tennis, and other games; lawn areas
for such activities as croquet, archery, clock golf; outdoor
swimming pool, theater or bandshell; fireplace, table and
benches for small group picnics; recreation building; chil-
dren’s playground; running track and spaces for field
events; center for day camping. Since, in general, the best
location for the playfield is at or adjoining a secondary

school site, the facilities serve both school and community
groups.

EVEN THOUGH few, if any, cities have achieved the area
standards developed by the Association, repeated de-

mands have been made that they be revised and updated.
To help achieve this objective, a National Committee on
Recreation Standards was appointed in 1960 with George
Hjelte as chairman, and members of a National Advisory
Committee were named by fifteen national organizations
with an interest in recreation areas. At a joint meeting of
the committee it was agreed to undertake initially a review
of standards for neighborhood and community recreation
areas.

As a first step, a request was broadcast for area plans
which, in the opinion of the authorities submitting them,
"exemplified an application of adequate standards to a local
situation.” Instructions for submitting plans and data sheets
to accompany them were sent to committee members and
others indicating a willingness to c00perate. Less than sixty
plans were finally collected, but, for various reasons, only
forty of them were suitable for study. Of these plans, thir-
teen were for separate neighborhood playgrounds, thirteen
were for areas at or adjoining neighborhood school sites.
and fourteen were for playfields.

Through the courtesy of Professor J. Marshall Miller, a
mcniber of the standards committee, arrangements were
made for the plans and accompanying data to be analyzed
by three graduate students in his class in “Introduction to
City and Metropolitan Planning” at Columbia University.
Among the factors studied were the size of the pr0perties,
the size and p0pulation of the areas served, the facilities
provided, and the Spaces allocated to each. For many plans
it was cxceedingly difficult to estimate the space allocated
to various uses because of the irregular shape or scattered
locations of the'units or because their uses and boundaries
were not clearly designated.

A study of the twenty-six playground plans indicated that
they varied widely in a number of respects; although, in
general, the school-related playgrounds and the separate
playgrounds were quite comparable. Playground sizes, for
example, varied from 2.43 acres to 12 acres and the area
served from .43 square mile to 4 square miles. The popu-
lation served varied from 1,336 to 24,724, and the popu-
lation per playground acre from 111 to 7,064. The follow-

* If five school-related and seven separate playgrounds were
enlarged, as recommended by the authorities reporting, their
acreage would be 8.07 aeres and 8 acres respeetively.

 

With few exceptions, the areas had the following units:
apparatus area, paved area for court games and/ or multiple
use, a field for sports, a shelter house or recreation building,
landscaped area or areas (some with picnic facilities).

Other units were reported at the number of areas indi-
cated:

Analysis of the plans for the fourteen areas classified as
community playfields likewise revealed wide variation. For
example, the size ranged from 8.54 to 22.42 acres; the area
served from 1.1 to 26.1 square miles. The population served
varied from 5,000 to 61,000, and the p0pulation per acre

of playfield from one acre per 342 to one per 7,143. The
median figures for the fourteen areas were:

Population Served _-____.__..._____.._.____-_ 27,684
Area Served ____._,..._.._._..________ 4.0 square miles

Population per Acre ot Playtield 1 acre per 1,475

All the playfield plans provided for one or more land-
scaped sections and areas for field sports. A majority in.
cluded the following units: areas for court and lawn games.
children’s playground, parking area (one or more), recrea-
tion building, and picnic area (one or more). The lack of
diversity in the activities made available at the playfields is
illustrated by the fact that the following facilities were indi-
cated on only one plan: boccie or roque court, bowling
green, craft area, fire circle, pitch-and-putt course, putting
green, running track, theater, and garden (wildflowers).

The wide variations in the size, service area, population.
and deveIOpment of the areas that supposedly approximated
standard conditions were surprising. However, in most re-
spects, the median areas did not vary widely from the NRA
standards. In the case of the playgrounds, their size was
between six to eight acres, their maximum radius a half mile,
the population served under six thousand, and the popula-
tion per playground acre well under one acre per one thou-
sand. As for the playfields, the median size was eighteen
acres and the median area served, four square miles, or a
radius of about a mile. The population served and the popu-
lation per acre of playfield, on the other hand, were much
higher than proposed by the standard.

The most significant finding was the very limited variety
of units and facilities on many of the areas and the inefficient

31

use and distribution of the available space. The standards .

committee determined that a second type of inquiry was
necessary to determine ( 1) the types of units and facilities
that should be provided on the neighborhood and commu-
nity recreation areas and (2) the amount of space that
should be allocated for each of these units and facilities. It
was felt that on the basis of the findings, space standards
for the two area types could be deve10ped. A subcommittee,
under the chairmanship of Oka T. Hester, was therefore
appointed and requested to undertake such a study.

To ACCOMPLISII the first objective, comprehensive lists of

units and facilities that might be included in the neigh-
borhood and the community recreation areas were prepared
and distributed widely. Recreation authorities were re-
quested to return them with an indication as to thc items
they considered esscntial. A tabulation of fifty-one returns
indicated the units and facilities that a majority of the re-
spondents believed should be provided. There was consider-
able difference of Opinion as to the importance of several
items in the two lists, but seventeen were approved for thc
neighborhood area and twenty for the community area.

Questionnaires listing the approved items were then pre-
pared for both area types, with spaces for entering the num-
ber of square feet considered essential for each unit. A sep-
arate landscape park unit appeared in the community area
list, but not in the one for the neighborhood recreation area.
Respondents were asked to assume that one area type would
serve a “normal” neighborhood of six thousand people, and
the other a “normal” community of twenty thousand people.
Forms were submitted to committee members, individuals
commenting on the earlier lists, and other authorities.

A summary of the data on twenty-eight forms for the
neighborhood recreation area and on thirty-one community
area forms was prepared for the standards committee meet-
ing at the 44th National Recreation Congress in Philadel-
phia. lt recorded a wide variation in the amount of space
recommended for the various units and facilities on the two
area types; also in the total acreage recommended for these
areas. It was apparent that some respondents failed to real-
ize the purpose of the inquiry and that others made unreal-
istic estimates. Although there was considerable agreement
on the part of many authorities as to the space requirements
of some of the units, the findings indicated clearly that rec-
reation and planning authorities differ widely in their opin-
ions as to the amounts of space needcd for essential elements
of neighborhood and community recreation areas.

Space Recommendations for Community Area Units.

The table that follows indicates the median space recom-
mended for each unit in a recreation area serving a commu-
nity of twenty thousand and the total space required for
these units.

In contrast with the similarity in the total space require-
ments for the neighborhood recreation area. as previously
indicated, the median space proposed for the sum of the
units in the community recreation area, 28.40 acres, is much
greater than the median of eighteen acres for the plans sub-
mitted in the first phase of the study. A still larger median

32

area, 34.52, was prOposed in the recommendations for total
space in the latter phase. The increase over the NRA play-
field space standard is due in part to the fact that it did not
provide for a separate park unit.

Space Requirements for Neighborhood Area Units.

The table that follows indicates the median space recom-
mended for each unit in a recreation area serving a neigh-
horhood of six thousand and the total space required.

The median total of unit spaces, 8.17 acres, is only slightly
more than the median of 6.57 acres for the plans of neigh-
borhood recreation areas suhmitted in the first phase of the
study; it is less than the 10.15 acres which was the median
amount of total acreage rccommended in the second phase.

Conclusions. Members of the National Committee on Rec-
reation Standards at its 1962 meeting agreed that, on the
basis of its experience, it was clcar that recreation area
standards cannot be determined by an opinionnaire inquiry.
It was further agreed that a nationwide study was needed.
probably to extend for at least two years, and requiring thc
full-time service of one or more highly qualified individuals.

RECREATION

Such a study, it was proposed, should be designed to develop
standards for all types of recreation areas administered by
governments below the state level. The committee urged
that such a study be undertaken immediately, but pointed
out that preliminary statements of standards for the guid-
ance of officials are needed. It is believed that this account
of the committee’s studies should be of value in considering
neighborhood and community areas, pending the availabil-
ity of more valid data. #

PRINCIPLES

THE FOLLOWING Statement of Principles was prepared for
National Recreation Association’s National Commit-
tee on Recreation Standards by Robert W. Crawford, Com-
missioner of Recreation in Philadelphia. The principles are
based on the assumption that the recreation use of leisure
time is an essential part of living and that a recreation sys-
tem should provide recreation Opportunities on a year-round
basis for all residents, regardless of sex, age, race, creed,
color, or economic status.

0 A recreation system requires properly distributed areas
and facilities.

I A recreation system requires areas and facilities that are
diversified in physical character, type, size and degree of
development.

I The different types and sizes of areas are determined by
the basic kinds of recreation service they are designed to
provide, while the distribution and degree of development
of areas are determined by the density and composition of
the population to be served.

0 Each recreation area or facility should be located on us-
able land which is t0pographically appropriate to, and suit-
able for, the purpose for which it is intended.

0 Each recreation area or facility should be centrally located
within the area it is intended to serve and should afford safe
and convenient access for those it is intended to serve.

0 Each recreation area or facility should include facilities
that will offer recreational opportunities for all age groups
it is intended to serve.

0 Whenever possible, appropriate recreation areas and fa-
cilities should be located near, or adjoining, public schools,
libraries, or community agencies of a recreational, group
work or informal educational nature.

0 In addition to the actual space required for the recreation
activities to be provided. consideration must be given to the
space required for safety, aesthetic or scenic values and serv-
ice filnctions (parking, circulation of patrons. concessions,

rest rooms, etceteral . it:

have been initiated by the Department of the Interior

following President Kennedy’s approval of forty-seven
such projects under the Accelerated Public Works Program.
Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall says the federal
share of the projects’ cost—$12,000,000—“will create a
wide range of assets that will more than repay the nation
for the investment.” Planting of new trees and rangeland,
construction of recreation facilities, building of roads, pre-
vention of erosion are among the many improvements sched-
uled by the Department of the Interior. The equivalent of
more than seventeen hundred men working steadily for a
year is assured in direct employment.

“New campgrounds will be created for the public and
existing ones will be improved and enlarged,” says Secretary
Udall. “Hunting and fishing will be aided by hetter facili-
ties for waterfowl and other wildlife. New boat docks will
be built, swimming areas will he created, and trails will be
blazed to scenic spots for hikers, picnickers, and campers.
In addition. nearly a score of projects earmarked for Indian
reservations will assure much-needed employment for many
hundreds of tribal membcrs while simultaneously enhancing
facilities for tourism, providing a better future for timber
stands, and curbing costly erosion.” Following is a state-
by-state breakdown" of some of the recreation areas and

facilities to be developed by the first public works projects
to be administered by the Department of the Interior:

ALASKA. The Kenai National Moose Range, a $200,000
projcct employing thirtyofive men for a year, will be started
to develop recreation facilities in this remote but accessible
wilderness which is beckoning more people every season.
Abandoned oil- and gaswell sites will be replanted, silting
in valuable salmon-nursery streams will be curhed, new pic-
nic areas and campgrounds will be created and old ones
improved, good routes to fishing and hunting areas will be
established, and corrective measures will be taken to better
conditions of the winter moose range, forest stands, and
waterfowl habitat.

a $400,000 project employing fifty men for a year. Roads
and trails will be rebuilt, three hundred campsites will be
rehabilitated, beaches cleaned, shore campsites established,
navigational aids installed, and new picnic areas developed.

CALIFORNIA. In Trinity and Lassen Counties a wide

range of improvements will be undertaken on public lands
to encourage recreation use and safeguard forests. The work
will cost $385,000 and will employ fifty men for a year. In
addition to many new campsites and picnic areas, access
roads will be built and the beach at West Valley Reservoir
improved. Brush clearing, snag felling, and other rehabili-
tation measures will be effected on four thousand acres in
Lassen County and a thousand acres in Trinity County.

ILLINOIS. The Crab Orchard Wildlife Refuge. which is

the site of nearly 1,500,000 visitorouse days during the year,
will be improved under a $400,000 project employing forty
men. Skyrocketing public use by residents of Illinois and
neighboring states has strained available accommodations.
Better facilities for hunters, fishermen, picnickers. swim-
mers, campers, and other users of the area will be provided.
The 43,000-acre refuge near Herrin is a major wintering
and migration area for large numbers of Canada geese and
other waterfowl.

Under a $500,000 federal grant, matched by an equal
amount from the state, the state’s Departm'ent of Conserva-
tion will launch a nineteen-county improvement program
centering on fish and wildlife projects. With the $1,000.000,
new fishing lakes will be created, wildlife habitat improved,
roads, trails, and fences built, waterfowl refuges developed,
and related conservation work performed. The far-reaching
program will he completed in eighteen months. Approxi-
mately 185 man-years of work will be provided.

MAINE. A $360,000 improvement program employing the
cquivalent of thirty-six men for a year will be undertaken
to revitalize Mooseborn National \Vildlife Refuge, one of the
most scenic areas of the nation near Calais. Existing camp-
grounds and picnic areas will be improved. a conservation-
edueation visitor center established, and new areas created
for camping, picnieking, hunting, and fishing. Other better-
ments will center on improving wildlife habitat and timber
resources in a refuge that will stress waterfowl production
and restoration of the woodcoek population to beckon hunt-
ers. Excellent fishing areas will be made more accessible
and visitor facilities for tourists and sightseers on Passama-
quoddy Bay will be rehabilitated to promote greater use

by the public.

MICHIGAN. The Seney National Wildlife Refuge area. in
the Upper Peninsula, will be the site of a $250,000 project
for developing recreation facilities, improving forest stands,
and bettering the wildlife habitat. Rapidly growing as a
playground for industrial centers along the Great Lakes
from Chicago to Detroit. the area offers great attractions
for wildlife “watchers,” for hunters, and fishermen. Work
will include improvement of recreation, picnic, and camp-
grounds, and construction of a conservation-education vise
itor center to accommodate the increasing numbers who par-

NEVADA. Under a $100,000 program, which will employ
the equivalent of twelve men for a year, recreation facilities
will he constructed in Lincoln County at Meadow Valley
Wash on public land and the Bunker Peak Access Road will
be improved. In Mineral County, a $100,000 program will
employ eleven men for a year and create three new recrea-
tion sites on public land. Two of the three developments
will he on Walker Lake at Sixteen-Mile Point and Tamarack
Point.

NE\V MEXICO. Many facilities will be built on public
land along the Rio Grande Gorge in Rio Arriha County to
serve visitors. The $400,000 project will include a fifteen-
mile access road, a new bridge, six parking, camp, and pic-
nic areas, and sixteen miles of foot trails leading to the hot-
tom of the gorge. Other work will cover brush-control
measures on thousands of acres and the installation of thirty
miles of fences. The equivalent of forty-four man-years of
work will result.

OREGON. Development of recreation facilities and im-
provement of forest lands on the public domain in the Rose-
burg-North Bend-Coos Bay areas and in Josephine County
will be undertaken at a cost of $390,000. Picnicking areas
will be established at Hobson Horn, Bear Camp, Deer Creek,
Burnt Mountain Cabin, Pack Creek. Cherry Creek, Bear
Creek, Darley Creek, Lone Rock, Cavitt Falls, Susan Creek
Falls, Wolf Creek Trail, and along the Rogue River Trail.

Forest improvement projects will include scventecn hundr id
acres of seeding and planting, a thousand acres of site-it.

provelnent work, seventeen hundred acres of thinning ant
pruning, and a thousand acres of snag fclling. Employ mcnt
opportunities equivalent to fifty-threc man-years of work
will result. In the Klamath Falls area major work will center
on improved recreation facilities on public land. Camping
and hunting facilities will be built at Gerber Reservoir along
with a boat-launching ramp, sanitation works, and surfacing
thirty miles of the Bonanza Road leading to the area. Fam-
ily camping units will be built at Parker and Chasc Moun-
tains and in the vicinity of the Cascade Trail and Topsy
Road. Other elements in the project will cover forest-con-
scrvation and stream clearance. Total cost will be $380,000,

providing the equivalent of thirty-five man-years of employ-
ment.

PENNSYLVANIA. The New Erie National Wildlife Ref-
uge in Crawford County will be the site of a $70,000 project
providing the equivalent of eight man-years of employment.
Various recreation facilities will be created to promote use
by the public. Other work will involve improvements to the
refuge to promote development of wildlife.

UTAH. Recreation sites and other improvcments for vis-
itors will be established on public land in Garfield County,
along with betterments for forest stands and hunting areas.
More than twenty camping and picnicking areas will be cre-
ated in the Karparowits Platcau, Sawmill Basin, and Mc-
Millin-Springs section. Seven miles of access road will be
built in Escalante Canyon for land maintenance purposes
and to aid hunters. Thousands of acres of forest land will
be improved and twenty miles of stock trails, seven miles
of horse trails, and six miles of fence will be provided. Total
cost will be $217,000, providing an equivalent of twenty-
seven man-years of employment.

WASHINGTON. A $130,000 improvement and develop-

ment program will be undertaken in this popular recreation
area which features 660 miles of shoreline along Lake
Roosevelt, behind the Grand Coulee Daln. Already visited
by some eight hundred thousand persons a year, the recrea-
tion area will be made more inviting by building a boat dock
at the North Marina, improving beaches at Kettle Falls, in-
stalling water systems for Fort Spokane and Kettle Falls,
rehabilitating an administration building, and providing
better sanitation facilities. Employment equivalent to ten
man-years” work will be created.

WISCONSIN. Under $30,000 in federal funds, matched

by a like amount from the Wisconsin Conservation Depart-
ment, thc state will cmbark on a series of improvements at
decr and ruffed grousc habitat and at streams and lakes
used for fishing. All such work will bc in Iron County and
will provide approximately sixty man-years of employment.

3- s A PEOPLE we have been notoriously apathetic. Less than a tenth of one percent of our federal budget
is devoted to the preservation of our national heritage. No lobbies stand ready to back park funds, for

no one gets rich on an investment in parks—that is, other than people . .

00M combos and ensembles of
T gray-flannel executives are really
tooling their horns! Some take
music breaks; some meet after work:

some even provide the entertainment at
their own conventions.

One musical phenomenon is the Chi-
cago Business Men’s orchestra, founded
in 1921 by an amateur boxer who liked
to play the string bass. This was the
first full-scale nonprofessional group of
its kind. Today, it is one of the few self-
supporting amateur orchestras and has
one of thc world’s most extensive music
libraries. Every Friday evening from
mid-September through May the eighty-
seven active members—university pro-
fessors, executives and men from many
other trades and professions—rehearse
for three hours. Two or three times each
year a concert is given for relatives,

36

 

business associates, and thc general
public—who gladly pay for the privi-
lege of hearing fine music.

Eloquent testimony to the bencfits
derived from the “do-it-yourself” trend
in music is the numbcr of doctor groups
popping up around the country. In Los
Angcles the Doctors’ Symphony, com-
prised of almost a hundred physicians,
presents a series of concerts for the
benefit of various charitable organiza-
tions. Other similar groups include the
Brooklyn Doctors’ Symphony, the Doc-
tors’ Orchestral Society of New York,
and doctors’ music groups in St. Louis,
Boston, and many other communities.
The Cleveland Heights Suburban Sym-
phony and the Central Utah Symphony
are just two of the many all-community
groups in which businessmen team up
musically with all types of citizens.

 

On the other side of the musical fence,
many businessmen find jazz and Dixie-
land the proper antidote for working-
day tensions. Groups like the “Oldest
Floating Dixieland Jazz Band East of
the Mississippi" and the "Salem Avenue
Sewer Rats" find that frequent jam ses-
sions have an unusual therapeutic value.
The “Floaters"—New York advertis-
ing and publishing executives-———were
brought together originally by a mutual
interest in sailing, but soon discovered
they had more in common when blow-
ing hot notes.

The Minneapolis “Sewer Rats,°’stable
businessmen, tradesmen, and mechanics
during the day, are noted for their
roaring ragtime at night. Like most
amateur musicians, the "Sewer Rats”
make music for their own enjoyment.
At first they held their jam sessions at

each others' homes; but when the ses-
sions lasted throughout the night, their
wives banished them to a downtown
office.

Some hot sounds come out of Pitts-
burgh on Saturday afternoons when the
Fellows Cluh meets. Dedicated to re-
laxation after a hard week’s work, the
"Fellows" indulge in a mixture ofjokes,
singing and Tiger Rag. \Vhile other
members whistle, stomp, clap, and eat
lunch (all at the same time), a group of
executives and a sprinkling of profes-
sional musicians blow away their cares
with the “blues.” These amateur jazz-
men are good 'enough to entice visiting
musicians to sit in for a few licks.

What is it that keeps these and twenty-
three million other American adults
busy making their own music? Every-
one has the urge to be creative; but for
most, there is little chance for self-
expression in work. 50 more and more
people are turning to creative activities
during leisure hours.

L1 PROGRAM

 

Evaluation of

Program Techniques

in Hospital Recreation

ROSCOE C. BROWN, JR.

HENEVER any one of us conducts
w a program, we wonder wheth-
er the program has accom-
plished what we want it to. The purpose
of evaluation is to find out just what
our program efforts have accomplished.
Evaluation involves some of the same
techniques as research, such as the use
of interviews, rating scales, participa-
tion analysis forms, questionnaires, and
even personality and sociometric inven-
tories. However, evaluation is not nec-
essarily research. Research involves
the use of experimental and control
groups and usually is planned to test an
hypothesis about the relationship be-
tween two or more factors. Evaluation
on the other hand is conducted to deter-
mine the extent to which a program has
accomplished its goals.

Objectives. The first step in evalua-
tion is to specify the objectives or goals
of a program. These objectives should
be stated in specific rather than general
terms. While an objective such as “to
improve the patient's personal and so-
cial adj ustlnent” is a good general state-
ment for a program brochure, it is not
very helpful in planning or evaluating
a program. \Vbat kind of personal and
social adjustment are we talking about?
Are we talking about a patient being
able to do things for himself, about his
personal ego strength, his willingness to
make friends, his ability to keep up a
conversation, or what? It is necessary
to be Specific in identifying objectives
so that the program can be planned to
accomplish them and so that the proper
evaluation procedures can be used to
assess the degree to which we have ac-
complished the objectives. The more

the objectives are stated in behavioral
terms rather than in philosophical
terms, the more adequate the program
planning and evaluation will he.

Timing and Techniques. The next
step in evaluation is to decide what
techniques and instruments should be
used to make the evaluation. Frequent-
ly, there will be another consideration.
Namely, when should the evaluation
take place? Often it will be desirable
to make before-and-after comparisons.
Therefore, some information will have.
to be collected before the actual hospital
recreation program begins. This step is
often overlooked by inexperienced
workers in the field. One of the im-
portant points is the need for before and
after measurement in order to evaluate
most programs.

ln planning the techniques or instru—
ments to be used, it would be helpful to
discuss this with research specialists,
psychologists, or sociologists who have
had experience in evaluating behavior.
Where the instruments will have to be
filled out by hospital personnel, it is
necessary to review the instruments
with them in order to be certain that the
personnel will understand what they
are to do. A pilot study is also helpful
in planning the evaluation. The instru-
ments may be personality-rating scales,
degree of medical improvement scales,
reports of ward activity, reports of pa-
tient interaction, or a tabulation of the
frequency of participation in activities
and the type of recreation activities par-
ticipated in. Reliability or consistency
of ratings is important; therefore, re-
liability studies where the same patient
is rated by two raters are also necessary
in order to he sure that the ratings are
accurate and unbiased.

Analysis. The final step in evaluation

is analysis of the information that has
been collected. In some instances the
comparisons are fairly easy to make. If
prior to hospital recreation, only five
or ten percent of the patients indulged
in any recreation and if after the pro-
gram has been conducted ninety percent
participate in recreation activities, a
complex analysis is not necessary. How-
ever, tbe picture is usually not that
clear. This is particularly true in terms
of personal and social adjustment. In
these cases it is necessary to compare
the amount of change in personal and
social adjustment to the type and
amount of participation in recreation
activities. At this point, again, it would
be helpful to consult someone with
training in the analysis and interpreta-
tion of data. The techniques to analyze
data are not extremely complex. but it
is desirable for a hospital recreation
specialist to take advantage of the ex-
perience of persons in other fields who
have had experience in evaluation.

Finally, the value of evaluation is de-
pendent on the willingness of hospital
recreation workers to use the results in
improving their programs. Remember.
the essential purpose of evaluation is to
determine the extent to which the pro-
gram meets tbe objectives set for it.
Thus, the evaluation should give us in-
formation to improve, modify, or
change either the objectives or the pro-
gram activities. If you will follow the
suggestions given, your hospital recrea-
tion program will be the obvious bene-
ficiary. In the final analysis, all of us
want to use every technique to improve
our contribution to society.

Research. It is important for hospital
recreation personnel to become aware
of the values that accrue to them as a

LJ PROGRAM

MEXICAN and SPANISH DANCING in RECREATION

Lou Hamilton

RECOGNIZING the
need for keep-
ing alive the cultur-
al heritages of its
people and holding
the interest of visi-
tors, the Recreation
Division ofSan An-
tonio, Texas, provides two outstanding
and unique services: classes in Mexican
and Spanish dancing free to any and all
who are interested, regardless of age or
race, and programs of these dances for
conventions, service organizations, and
public entertainment. Because this city
is a major gateway to Mexico, it has a
blend of many cultures and visitors are
particularly interested in the Mexican
and Spanish influences seen on all sides.

Classes in the above subjects are
taught on the playgrounds over the city.
Babies, as soon as they can walk, begin
learning to move to the Latin rhythm;
the girls learn to swirl their skirts. As
they develop, they are taught heel work,
castanet playing, and all of the tech-
niques needed for both Mexican and
Spanish dancing. They then progress to
the authentic dances of old Mexico and
flashing flamenco of Spain.

The classes are taught by two out-
standing teachers, Bertha and Yolanda
Almaguer. Bertha, trained in Mexico,
has been teaching with the division for
twenty-five years. A dedicated person,
she takes her vacation each summer to
return to Mexico where she sees the
traditional dances of the various states;
shops in the marketplaces in many of
the larger cities to select and purchase
costume materials; browses through
music stores for records and orchestra-
tions. She always makes a point of

recreation department in San Antonio,
Texas, for thirty-one years. She is chair-

tional Services.

going through the little town of Quiroga
where she buys dozens of pairs of Mexi-
can-made castanets for her beginners.

(There they are only five pesos a pair——
approximately forty cents in American
money.) Some of the students use the
plastic castanets, but as soon as an indi-
vidual is sure he really is interested in
Spanish dancing, he wants the “real”
castanets made of imported grenadilla
wood. The really good castanets are rel-
atively expensive, ranging from $15 to
$50 a pair, depending on tone, size,
weight, action, balance, and voice.

Yolanda, Bertha’s niece, began danc-
ing in her aunt’s classes at the age of
three. When she was fourteen she was
so proficient in her art that she was
made assistant teacher with thc city.
After graduating from junior college,
Yolanda was awarded a scholarship to
study Spanish dancing in Madrid, Spain
—the only American girl ever to win
this scholarship.

In Madrid, Yolanda studied with the

two most outstanding Spanish dance

 

teachers in Spain, Paco Reyes and Clo-
ria Librano, and received a certificate
of completion of the advanced course of
the Academia del Danza Espanol. She
has also studied Spanish dancing with
Carla y Fernando, Anita y Manolo, Ja-
vier y Carmela. The six courses in Mex-
ican folk dancing brought to San An-
tonio by the University of Mexico were
also included in Yolanda’s training. _

A full-time dance teacher and per-
former, she has been offered opportuni-
ties in movies, tours, with professional
groups, a private studio, but she stays
with her job of teaching for the city be-
cause she can reach so many more chil-
dren. Yolanda has become a master at
choreography. Each year the symphony
society requests that she choreograph
one of the classics in Spanish music——
such as “Capriccio Espaiiol” and “The
Three Cornered Hat"-——-for presentation
in the municipal auditorium. This is her
second year as the choreographer and
director of the Alamo Kiwanis Club’s

DIGEST

Two-Way Street to
Professional Administration

 

COORDINATION
COOPERATION AND

COMMUNICATION
E. v. PUTNAM

 

Too MANY cooxs can spoil the broth.
Citizen boards, generally speaking.
provide an excellent sounding board for
public opinion. Their prime role, how-
ever, is the setting of park and recrea-
tion policy with guidance from the
professional administrator. The board
member that all administrators hope for
is the one who has the total interests of
the community, county or state at heart,
not pet projects or limited interests.

Citizen boards should not take on ad-
ministrative responsibilities, either sep-
arately or collectively. No professional
park administrator worth his salt can
operate efficiently under conditions
where one, two, or every member of a
board is telling him what to do. Many
excellent park and recreation plans have
failed because this method of operation
has been tried.

The relationship between board and
administrator, however, is not a one-
way street. The board indicates within

40

broad policy outlines what to do. The
administrator then is left to decide how
it is to be done. Any attempt by either
board or administrator to take over the
othcr’s prerogative can bring conflict or
even disaster in which the entire system
suffers.

The administrator needs a board in
which he can have faith, and vice versa.
This means that the members must know
how to be board members. in itself 3 del-
icate skill. In addition, board members
must be seriously interested in park and
recreation matters, be willing to under-
stand and keep abreast of the best cur-
rent philosophy relating to parks and
recreation, and spend some time in
weighing matters before making policy
decisions. This requires experience and
time, and new members should be slow
to pass on critical matters, particularly
policy changes, until they are well in-
formed.

The administrator should not dictate
to his board in policy matters. He
should be aVailable if asked, sensitive
to their wishes, having a working rela-
tionship with the board so that matters
can be discussed intelligently with it.
When such rapport has been established
between an administrator who knows
his business and a board that knows its
responsibilities. then everyone benefits.

One more thing important to efficient
hoard functioning: It should operate on
a business-like basis. This means hold-
ing regularly scheduled meetings at reg-
ularly schcduled places, using a pre-
arranged agenda. New and controversial
matters not on the agenda should be de-
ferred until proper study can be given
them.

The administrator is the “go-between”
for board to staff. Except when specifi-
cally requested by the administrator, no
staff member should go directly to a
board member. Likewise, the board
member should respect the authority of
the administrator and not bypass the
director by contaeting a staff member
directly. Staff members should recog-
nizc the chain of command, which, by
the way, should be clearly defined in an
official chart of organization understood
by all.

Staff and line members should oper-
ate through staff and line supervisors,
with the right to go to the administra-
tive head of the agency if the occasion
warrants, and satisfactory solutions
cannot be reached through immediate
superiors. If board action eventually is
required, the process should operate
through the administrator. Elementary
as all this sounds, these simple princi-
ples of administrative organization are

RECREATION;
\

often ignored, with resultant damage to
the sensitive relationships within an or-
ganization that must be kept in tune
with each other for efficient operation.

There is a further responsibility
which board, administrator, and all
staff members must assume in any pub-
lic park and recreation agency Opera-
tion. All are servants of the public
which pays the bills. The board, re-
gardless of whether it is appointed or
elected, is supposed to represent the pub-
lic. What that board does reflects the
custodianship of the agency just as
much as does the work of the individual
staff member who actually meets the
public. No staff member can Operate
well in a climate of confusion and ig-
norance. The program director or the
park ranger may be the only person in

THE
BOARD MEMBER

APPROACH
JOHN R. VIBBER

 

To STAY in existence and advance the
recreation and park program for
its community, members of a “working
board” must be willing to do more than
attend board meetings and answer
“Yes” or “No.” It works on a small
budget compared to what is needed. It
sets policy as does ,any other board. It
must also be willing with advice of its
professional administrator, to individu-
ally or collectively go to the community
for support. This board, with the aid
of the administrator, will work up a
project, such as the financing of a ball-
field, conducting recreation surveys,
passage of bond issues, etcetera; then be
willing as individuals to go out and do
the contact work necessary to sell the

JANUARY, 1963

the entire park system whom the visitor
or participant sees face to face. The
kind of person he is, the pride he takes
in his work, the way he is treated reflects
all the way up the line to the board it-
self. No staff member, director, or
board member can afford to Operate in
a vacuum, ignoring the needs and de-
sires of those who use the facilities and
who pay the bills.

As professional parks and recreation
people, we have a big job to do. If we
believe in our profession, if we want to
see ourselves grow in number and sta-
ture, we must go to work—not just to
get the field ready for spring practice,
but for a full season’s play. Not just to
aid our own particular bailiwick, but to
aid the whole cause of parks and recre-
ation at all levels of government. We

project. All efforts should be coordi-
nated by the administrator.

A board member should be willing to
give not only time necessary for meet-
ings but extra time to learn and under-
stand how he or she may equip the area
with the proper recreation program and
the parks to carry it on. A board mem-
ber must have a genuine and sincere in-
terest in recreation and parks and a de-
sire to learn more about them.

If a board member finds he does not

have the necessary time or interest,
please, in all fairness to the other board
members and the community he should
tender his resignation so that the efforts
of the board will not suffer. Let one
who has the time and interest take his
place.

A board member should plan on at-
tending recreation and park conferences
and meetings out-of-town, at least twicc
a year, and oftener if possible, to learn
what others are doing and how. This
may even entail expenditure of some
personal funds, depending on the finan-

need to “plug” for better legislation, for
better professional leadership stand-
ards, for review of area and develop-
ment practiccs, and work toward more
adequate financing—again at all levels
of govcrmnent, not just in the town or
state in which you hold a job.

In order to accomplish what the pub-
lic has every right to expect of us, both
board members and administrator must
realize there is a two-way street to
achieving a good park and recreation
system. To reach this objective there
must be coordination, cooperation and
communication between board mem-
bers and administrators. #

ington, Metropolitan Park District.

cial status of the board. A board mem-
ber should be willing to speak before
groups and spread the “gospel” 'of rec-
reation and parks.

A board member should be willing
to accept the chairmanship of the board
if nominated. The chairmanship should
be rotated among the members, with no
member permitted to serve more than
two years in succession. This way mem-
bers will become better acquainted with'
the entire operation of the program.

A new board member has as his prime
role the setting of recreation and park
policy, with guidance from the profes-
sional administrator. The board mem-
ber that all administrators hope for is
the one who has the total interest of the

community at heart. if:

CRADLE or THE FUTURE. A film, based on the
book Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeast-

Megalopolis: Cradle of the Future. The film-

lush and arresting. Occasionally, the narrative
falters because the English of Jean Gottman,
author of the textual survey, is not as lucid as
his insight. This, however, is the only major de-
feet in the film, which surveys the case for and
problems of the immense mushrooming urban
area which will soon cover the country’s eaSt-
ern seaboard from the suburbs above Boston to
those below Washington, D.C. The need for
cutting the red tape crosswise instead of
lengthwise is cited by Professor Gottman, who
feels that this arca has a plethora of govem-
mcnt agencies and bureaus at all levels pain-
fully impeding progress in urban renewal and
enlightened city planning. The film is avail-

Sandcraft

AM) PLAY is a natural activity which appeals to even the
S tiniest tots who pat the sand into mounds, let it run
through their fingers. and dig holes and tunnels in it. Sand-
craft is a more highly developed, constructive form of sand
play. With good leadership, it encourages the ingenuity and
develops the imagination of children of all ages and may lead
to an interest in sculpture, ceramics, or other sinzilar activi-
ties.

Preparation of Sand

The best sand to use for modeling is No. 1 unwashed river
sand or quicksand, which is very fine and sharp and has a
small amount of soil in it to aid in binding, or fine white
seashore sand. It should be thoroughly sifted, while dry,
through a fine sieve, and then moistened well, preferably at
least an hour or two before using so the water has time to
saturate it evenly. It is of proper working consistency when
a small amount of it, squeezed in one hand, holds together
and retains the finger imprints when the hand is reopened.
Kneading the sand after moistening helps to make it more
workable.

Modeling Methods

There are three basic methods of modeling:

1. Flat Modeling. An outline is drawn on level sand and
areas are then filled in with wet sand rounded and smoothed.
It is used in making relief maps, profile work, etcetera.

2. Bats-Relief or 45-Degree Angle Modeling. Wet sand is
piled into a 45-degree angle pyramid. The outline is drawn
on the slanted side of the pyramid and then sand is either
cut away from the design or wet sand is added to build up
the design. Used for letters, flowers, animals, and birds with
long slender legs or neck, etcetera.

3. Modeling in the Round. This method is most commonly
used and is suitable for the majority of subjects, such as
buildings, animals, airplanes, boats. The following tech-
niques are used:

(a) A mound of sand is piled up, roughly similar to the
general shape of the subject, which is then sculptured from
the mound.

(b) The subject is built up from the level surface and
patted and formed into shape as the modeling progresses.

Tools

Hands are the most important tools for sand modeling and
are the only tools necessary for large simple subjects; how-
ever, certain implements are helpful when more detailed
work is being accomplished:

Packers—large flat hoards used in pairs, one in each hand,
to shift and push together piles of sand and to press it hard
and smooth.

Cutters—thin, sharp, knife-like pieces of wood for cutting,
slicing and shaping.

Temps—flat pieces of wood with a dowel handle used,
potato masher-fashion, to flatten or press down surfaces.

Points—long thin sticks, pointed one end, thin and flat
on the other, used for fine detail work.

Many additional tools can be improvised and used to get
various surface effects—wooden picnic forks, spools, et-
cetera. Tools should be removed from the sandbox and
cleaned after use to prevent warping, and rubbed with sand-
paper to keep them smooth and sharp.

Coloring And Preserving Models

Color may be added by sprinkling calcimine colors or
powdered luster paints (which are more rivid) on the wet
model; or liquid dyes may be applied with an atomizer,
clothes sprinkler, or soft brush. For a temporary preserva-
tive, molasses, glue, or salt added to the water used to mois-
ten the sand will keep the models from crumhling as they
dry out for several hours. Sprinkling the wet model with
cement will hold it in shape for several days.

Modeling W itli Accessories

This type of modeling permits use of any materials—and
unlimited ingenuity and imagination—as well as sand and
enables modelers to work in smaller detail and achieve more
realistic effects. It is the kind of sandcraft most often done
on playgrounds. In this, as in all modeling with children.
making things in proper proportions should be emphasized.
This type of modeling also is easily coordinated with other
playground activities: accessories made in craft classes:
scenes from storytale hour; stage setting and scenes from
dramatic productions; and plans for special events, such as
playground festivals, summer themes, and playdays.

Projects

Some projects which encourage the use of the imagination
and research are:

1. Scenes from American History: the landing of the Pil-
grims, Paul Revere’s ride, Columbus sailing to America, the
Boston Tea Party, the first Thanksgiving, Custer’s last stand.
a colonial settlement, a covered wagon, the Gold Rush.

2. Young Americans in Action: Pilgrim period, colonial
period, Revolutionary period, homesteading period, Dixie
frontier period, Northwest frontier, Southwest frontier, Gold
R ush period, industrial-age period, space-ship period.

3. Visits to Far-Away Places: a Japanese village scene.
Venice with its canals, a tropical island, an Eskimo village.
the pyramids and sphinx in Egypt, etcetera.

4. An “Ideal Playground” Scene.

5. Gala Events: a circus, the coronation of Queen Eliza-
beth, Joseph Lee Day on a playground.

6. Castles and Buildings: well-known buildings, leaning
Tower of Pisa, etcetera.

7. Scenes from W ell-Known Stories and Poems: Hansel
and Gretel discovering the witch’s house; Bambi and his
forest friends; Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn; Red
Riding Hood and the wolf; the three little pigs; Cinderella;
dozens of other familiar and imaginative scenes from favor-
ite childhood tales—Submitted by MARY MCDONALD, Rec-

Look Into the Future

Continued from Page 13

 

extreme right, the extreme left, and the extreme middle!

I believe so much in these things—the consolidation of
local recreation and park services and the increasing need
for the highest and best-qualified kind of management which
knows how to temper and apply natural resources for vari-
able human use-—that I have staked a large part of my own
department’s future on it. We have also developed a cur-
riculum in park management, fully aware that the responsi-
bility for professional preparation not only summons but
demands all the knowledges and resources of city planning,
landscape architecture, horticulture, forestry, and kindred

fields.

Financial Considerations. It would be futile to discuss
the future of this question without at least touching upon
the fiscal and financial considerations. Competition for the
tax dollar will become more, not less, acute. Then, who can
and will pay? If we judge by the amount of money Ameri-
cans spend now each year for leisure goods and services, I
think the user will pay. If we have a higher standard of liv-
ing and increased family purchasing power—and the trend
is clearly that way—more people will be able to pay for
many of their recreation and park services, many of their
leisure needs will not have to be subsidized. I don’t mean
that parks and public recreation should or can be self-sup-
porting, anymore than public education or public health
could survive on their own income. Society’s financial re-
sponsibility does not disappear; however, the individual, the
user, should pay when he is able, and he will pay for that
which interests him. I never heard anyone complain about
the cost of something he really wanted. I see public funds
for the acquisition of lands, the improvement of property,
management, and basic services, and maintenance. I see
user revenues to cover some costs of operation and mainte-
nance, instruction in recreation skills, and the like.

Our Urban Parks. I hope that our acres of green sur-
rounded by oceans of asphalt, that is, our local parks, never
stray too far from their original purpose; that is, to preserve

the beauties of nature amid man's exploration of it, to
counterbalance nature’s purposeful planning against what
man leaves mostly to chance. Nevertheless, they will, as
will all our important institutions, our homes, and our
schools, reflect the age in which they exist, and this is the
age of science, if not the age of reason and good judgment!
Our urban parks will interlock with science—and education
—and the humanities and culture in their finest forms.

Our metropolitan park systems have long since made way
for the arts and sciences. Witness, for example, the Shedd
Aquarium and the Natural History Museum in the Chicago
Park District or Robin Hood Dell in Philadelphia’s F air-
mount Park. There are many examples. Now we shall see
a great expansion along these lines in the smaller cities. Let
me illustrate by referring to the Peoria, Illinois, Park Dis-
trict with its Lakeview Center for the Arts and Sciences.
Here in the park system, beside a tree-lined ravine, flooded
to form a lake and waterfall, the visitor finds not only sculp-
tured gardens and a place to picnic, a swimming pool, and
ice rink, but also the Peoria Players Theater, a planetarium,
a museum with exhibit space, library, book bazaar, and
other attractions. Here will be centered the efforts of the
Arts and Science Foundation which includes among its units
the Art Center, Academy of Science, several garden and
floral groups, as well as multiple theater and musical aggre-
gations, including the symphonies. This is a long cry from
stay-ofi-the-grass signs and the Dutch elm disease. So, I
say, in the future expect more of the arts and sciences in
your parks—and, I hope, more of your parks in the arts and
sciences.

THE FUTURE, as always, is unpredictable, if predictability
is equated with absolute certainty. The best that can
be said of these predictions is that they have their roots in
the past and in the observable present. The foundations and
beginnings of many of these trends and expectations are at
this moment a matter of fact. The odds favor their coming
into full bloom in the future. if for no other reason than that
they are cloaked in man’s eternal search and struggle to at-
tain maximum satisfactions—a state of being which, in-
evitably in the future, will have to be much realized in
leisure. But if they are to be attained, all of us will have to
climb the right mountains. if:

 

George Butler Retires

Continued from Page 17

 

past and present borough officials, commission and commit-
tee members attended a dinner in his honor, at which his
invaluable services to the community were recognized and
the gymnasium in the Loonia Recreation Center was officially
named the George D. Butler Gymnasium.

Membership on commissions and committees and the shar-
ing of professional knowledge are types of service that are
appreciated. George Butler is appreciated for these things
in Leonia; he is beloved for such gestures as rolling up his
sleeves and joining the volunteers who cleaned, painted, and
repaired the recreation building; for providing f with sub-

46

stantial assistance from Mrs. Butler) a picnic lunch for the
boys on Leonia’s championship baseball team on the day
they played a tournament schedule that allowed no time out
for meals; and for the boundless energy and enthusiasm he
brought to the community’s recreation services and prob-
lems.

During his years with the Association, his fellow workers
came to know that his good,humor and cooperative spirit
were equalled only by the firmness of his refusal to retreat
from any stand which he believed right. They hold him in
high regard and deep affection. Much as they will miss him.
they are genuinely happy that he will now have leisure to
put into practice some of the principles he has expounded
with such distinction. #

R FOR THE ILL £3 HANDICAPPED

 

'i' Developing a sense of achievement
and self-respect is an integral part of the
philosophy behind the dynamic recrea-
tion program for the blind at Bird S.
Coler Memorial Hospital and Home on
'Welfare Island in New York City. Rec-
reation Director Mrs. Marjorie Haycs,
a staff member, volunteers and skilled
workers from The Lighthouse (for the
blind) provide a wide variety of ac-
tivities, such as bingo (Braille cards),
bowling, handicrafts, and outdoor bar-
becues and picnics. Twice a month the
program furnishes the services of a
skilled Braille teacher. During the past
summer, eight residents of Coler were
taken weekly to a day camp in Yonkers,
New York. The camp is operated by the
social group work program of the Jew-

ish Guild for the Blind.
'i' The Musician’s Aid Society of New

York, under the direction of its execu-
tive director, Dr. Gregory S. Brooks, has
developed a plan for a musicians’ “city”
in Manhattan with special benefits for
retired or indigent musicians. The hous-
ing development will include recreation
facilities and a convalescent home.

+ A $141,000 grant for a three-year

study of how a community center can

help physically handicapped children
in its neighborhood has been made to

the Associated YM-YWHA’s of Greater
New York by the U.S. Children’s Bu-
reau. The grant, the first ever made for
such a study, will expand a pilot pro-
gram at the Mosholu-Montefiore Com-
munity Center in the Bronx, New York,
which has been integrating handicapped
children into play groups of nonhandi-
capped children in a typical community
center setting.

lrving Brodsky, general director of
the Associated Y’s, said, “The grant
makes possible a service and research
program with implications far beyond
the orthopedically handicapped group
involved. What we learn about these
physically handicapped children can
also help in the planning of welfare
services for children who are emo-
tionally disturbed; mentally retarded,
or socially deprived. We are trying to
identify the influences that help children
accept other children with special needs.
We want to see how community center
services can help handicapped Children
and broaden their acceptance by chil-
dren who are not handicapped.”

MORTON THOMPSON, Ed.D.

+ Nassau County. New York, has just
organized the “Nassau County Recrea-
tion Service for the Honmbound.” The
county has invited all health and wel-
fare agencies to participate in a county-
wide community recreation service to
the handicapped and aged homebound.
The plans call for committee chairman
in each town of Nassau County, with the
committee chairman supervising volun-
teers who will be trained, equipped and
assigned to work in the homes of home-
bound in their specific communities. A
central referral program will be con-
ducted through the Nassau County Red
Cross which sponsored this new devel-
opment and which based the approach
on the results of the National Recreation
Association’s research project on rec~
reation for the homebound conducted
for the U.S. Office of Vocational Re-
habilitation. The service hopes that as
a program matures an activity center
for the homebound will become an in-
tegral part of this community service.

'i' Fountain House in New York City,
a treatment center for recently dis-
charged mental patients, recently com-
pleted a three-year demonstration proj-
ect showing that volunteers can become
an integral part of a treatment program
for recently discharged mental patients.
According to the last report from Foun-
tain House, 128 volunteers are now en-
rolled serving six hundred patients. They
serve in a wide variety of capacities.
Many teach classes in skills, photogra-
phy, bridge, typing; others act as host-
esses, organize special entertainment,
conduct interviews for the research de-
partment. or visit patients in their
homes. Volunteers, the report states,
are there to help separate the patient
from a sense of social isolation and
to provide a contact with healthy, in-
terested, lay people. In this regard, the
report says, “Volunteers are not only
useful but indispensable.”

'i' The General Extension Division of
the University of Minnesota offers as
one of its many services correspondence
study in a variety of fields and disci-
plines. One of particular interest is:
Orientation to Recreation in Hospitals.

+ Most of today’s tuberculosis patients
are ambulatory and feeling well, reports
the Bulletin of the National Tuberculo-
sis Association of September 1962.
Their need for specific recreation and
education opportunities is greater than
ever before. Most of these activities
have moved from the bedside to the
shOp, auditorium, and classroom. Music
and drama groups, various social
events, as well as commentaries over
the hospital radio and intercommunica-
tion system have proven desirahle ways
of providing outlets for patient energy
and imagination. With moving pic-
tures and the large variety of radio and
TV programs available, visiting troupes
of entertainers have largely faded from
the scene.

RECREATION

Mexican and Spanish Dance
Continued from Page 39

 

“Fiesta Noche Del Rio” which is pre-
sented three times weekly throughout
the summer for thousands of visitors to
the city.

THE CLASSES, free of charge to the

public, range in size from forty to
150. in age from two years to adults
(the mothers like to dance, too) ; from
strictly beginners to advanced profes-
sional pe0ple. The teachers go to a dif-
ferent playground each afternoon after
school, and during the summer months
there are morning classes plus one eve-
ning class for advanced students. Those
who are especially eager to learn may
attend several classes a week.

The music used for the classes is
record and piano music, with Bertha ac-
companying. Often, for “baby” num-
bers Bertha makes an arrangement of
simple tunes for the little ones, and then
makes recordings so the children can
practice at home. In really big produc-
tion numhers and suites, a record often
is tape-recorded so the dancers can work
on spots as needed.

Where orchestras are used to accom-
pany the dancers, the orchestrations are
sometimes bought in San Antonio,
sometimes in Mexico, and often have to
be especially written if the dance is one
of the Indian dances of Mexico where
only the melody has been recorded.

From these classes come the pro-
grams that are enjoyed by many thou-
sands over the state each year. The
youngsters have danced with the San
Antonio Symphony Orchestra, the op-
era festivals, for state, national, and
world conventions, service organiza-
tions, hospitals, armed forces, Red
Cross, and many other groups. They
help in such fund-raising activities as
poliothons and telethons. These pro-
grams, too, are free of charge—a serv-
ice of the San Antonio Recreation Di-
vision. Out-of-town trips are made fre-
quently, asking only transportation and
meals for the participants.

VI‘HE RECREATION DIVISION itself pre-
sents a series of programs each
summer at the Arneson River Theatre.

JANUARY, 1963

This is a delightful and unique outdoor
theatre on the banks of the peacefully
winding San Antonio River. The stage
is on one bank, with dressing rooms
built in old Spanish style architecture.
The other bank has been terraced to seat
a thousand spectators on its grassy tiers.
Highlighting these programs is, of
course, the Mexican and Spanish danc-
ing.

The costumes used are a source of
great interest to the spectators because
they are always crisp, colorful, beauti-
ful, and authentic. They belong to the
dancers. The teachers make a sketch
with spccifications of the costume to he
made, select the materials and colors,
and the mothers make them. Many of
the costumes cost $50 and 375, being
lavish with ruffles and sequins. Only in
a few cases are the costumes bought in
Mexico. Since the group dances in so
many programs, parents insist on good
materials and two or three new cos-
tumes a year. The parents feel that since
they don’t pay for the classes, they can
certainly provide beautiful costumes for
the programs. Many of the Recreation
Division dancers achieve such profi-
ciency that they dance professionally all
over the state and quite a few are danc-
ing in California. Many also have be-
come teachers of the (lance.

Through this program of Mexican
and Spanish dancing, recreation is pro-
vided for the dancers, their parents, and
thousands of spectators each year. The
dancers are in such demand that some-
times hookings are made a year, often
two, in advance, and seldom can a pro-
gram be scheduled without the request
heing registered at least a month in ad-
vance. So many requests are made that
the service has to be limited to recog-
nized organizations and large conven-
tions.

Some folks prefer watching the ba-
bies dance—~“They’re so cute.” Some
prefer watching the advanced groups,
they are near perfection; hut whatever
you want to see in the way of Mexican
and Spanish dancing, the San Antonio
Recreation Division has it. Come see

us! #

NEW PUBLICATIONS

Park and Recreation Administrators,
Garrett G. Eppley, Ed.D. American In-

stitute at Park Executives, Oglebay
Park, Wheeling, West Virginia. Pp. 36.
Paper, $2.00.

In issuing this publication the Amer-
ican Institute of Park Executives has
provided a “Who’s Who” of park and
recreation leaders in America. It like-
wise provides a record of significant
park and recreation developments in the
localities and states in which these lead-
ers have rendered their major service.
The bulletin is based upon a twelve-
thousand mile trip by the author, spon-
sored by Indiana University and the
institute.

The analysis of the professional prep-
aration, scholastic standing, previous
employment, length of service, and affili-
ations of the leaders as a group reveals
interesting data not previously avail-
able. One wishes that the biographical
sketches and the descriptions of the
leaders’ accomplishments were more
uniformly informative and matched the
excellent photographs of the twenty-two
individuals. All park and recreation
workers will find the booklet interesting
and instructive even though they may
wonder why one or more of their favor-

ite leaders was not included.—G.D.B.

Fitness for Elementary School Chil-
dren Through Physical Education, Vic-
tor P. Dauer. Burgess Publishing Com-
pany, 420 South Sixth Street, Minne-
apolis 15. Pp. 238. $4.75.

This is an extraordinarily good book.
It has been written by an author with
experience in public-school teaching
and teacher training. He understands
boys and girls, knows physical activities
in the total picture of youth fitness. If
his philosophy of activity for all on a
well-planned progressive basis from
grades one through six had been fol-
lowed for the last twenty years we would
not be faced with our present situation
of too many youngsters with no real love
of activity and too few basic skills to
make participation really enjoyable.

The author recognizes the difficulties
of the average classroom elementary
teacher who is responsible for physical
education along with all the other sub-
jects. He has. therefore, arranged the
material according to the needs of dif-
ferent grade levels and the material is
chosen and arranged not alphabetically
but in a sequential form. The book is
complete in itself and describes each

50

game and rhythmic activity rather than
naming games and sending the teacher
to the library to find out how to play
them.

In addition to an excellent choice of
activities on grade level, the author has
given helpful chapters on class manage-
ment, the choice of play equipment, the
role of the teacher and the school ad-
ministrator and the ways of adapting a
program to special needs of children or
for the classroom when outdoor facili-
ties or an all-purpose room are not avail-
ahle. It is the kind of book which has
been needed for a long time and is a far
cry from the usual game book. I strong-
ly recommend it for teachers or recrea-

tion leaders.———V.M.

A Handbook at Arts and Crafts for
Elementary and Juniar High School
Teachers. Willard Wankelman and
Marietta and Philip Wigg. William C.

Brawn and Campany, Dubuque, Iowa.
Pp. 193. $3.75.

The title of this book tells exactly
what it is about. An extremely well-
writtcn book for teachers, giving the
procedures of how-to-do-it and what ma-
terial is needed to do the work, it is in
plastic, looseleaf form, very well illus-
trated with photographs of each prob-
lem. Here is a compilation of “care-
fully sifted problems representing the
most recent professional attitudes to-
ward the presentation of art at this
level.”

Part I of this book has concise and
very good ideas on basic concepts of art
instruction. It has been written for
teachers so could be very helpful to rec-
reation leaders as it is full of new and
old ideas. It is the best compilation of
arts and crafts for these ages I am
aware of. The book is well designed
from cover to cover and is a bargain for
this price—Mary B. Cummings.

Invitation to Rhythm, James R. Clem-
ens. William C. Brown Company, Du-
buque, Iowa. Pp. 164. Spiralbound,
$3.75.

This spiralhound book is illustrated
most amusingly by children’s drawings.
It is a how-to book, written for teachers.
parents, and recreation leaders inter-
ested in giving children meaningful ex-
periences in music-making. It does its
job remarkably well, and should be very
useful.

The first section deals with the mak-
ing of simple musical instruments, using
odds and ends of material. This in it-

self is excellent motivation for using
those instruments. Part II shows how to
do this—to correlate music with move-
ment, with notes, with drama, with
games. It is particularly helpful to have
these suggestions organized by age—
levels—from the four-year-old through
the “elevens.” Information on records
and how to use them adds to the book’s
usefulness.

Mr. Clemens, supervisor of music
education for the Inglewood Unified
School District in California, has made
a real contribution to the recreation
field, and his book is more than worth
its nominal pricc.

Sand Sculpturing, Mickey Klar Marks.
Dial Junior Boaks, 461 Park Avenue
South, New Yark 16. Pp. 38, illus-
trated. $2.75.

Many recreation departments and
leaders use or make plaster casts. There
is a fascination in seeing a liquid harden
and become an object, whether it be
original or copy. Here is a fresh and
new approach, using the established in-
terest but channeling it into a much
more interesting and creative art form.

Sand sculpturing is an ancient art,
simple and inexpensive. The design is
modeled in wet sand, the plaster drih-
bled in—and the result is surprisingly
interesting and modern. Mrs. Marks is
an expert, who knows how to give clear.
simple instruction. Here’s a new avenue
for an old program. This small, com-
pact, and very well-written book is illus-
trated by a number of photographs by
Sidney G. Bernard. Mrs. Marks and he

make an extremely good team. (See

READING LITERATURE ALOUD. Oxford

The printed word in a poem or play is
like a note in music. It must be made
to sound to gain its full effect. How it
shall sound and the ways of making it
sound are the chief concern of the pub-
lications listed. The methods in each
instance are educational-recreational,
not remedial. Although primarily edu-
cational, the poems, plays, and prose
may well be used by recreation groups.
The poems collected by Carrie Rasmus-
sen lend themselves to varied presenta-
tion. The selection of S. Perry Congdon
range from early Greek drama to recent
Broadway plays, and the commentary
clearly outlines the distinctive qualities
of each play. Reading Literature A land
contains a wide selection of poetry,
verse, and prose, along with an analysis
of ways in which they may be per-
formed. Reading aloud effectively is
quite an art and when achieved brings
delight to both performer and listener.

Of the firsthand best—books on this

ence and research at the Children’s
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, where
for six years the author and staff worked
with children under treatment. The
suggested play activities and play ma-
terials are not guesswork. They are
based upon eXperimental trials and re-

will find this book a clear, informal, and
instructive guide to activities that will
not only amuse the sick or convalescent

child, but which will also be good

Techniques in

Hospital Recreation
Continued from Page 38

_—
result of participation in research proj-

ects. Probably the most dillicnlt step is
to get started. In the beginning, you
should begin with a relatively simple
project with modest objectives: for ex-
ample, when you conduct a progratu on
a ward which has as its purpose devel-

 

 

 

opment of the socializing behaviors of
patients, it would be relatively simple
to do a socioinetric analysis. This could
be done by charting patients’ interac-
tion before the program and patients9
interaction after the program. The re-
sull of this analysis would be helpful
in determining whether or not the pro-
gram was eerctive. Second, you should
seek the help of those persons on your
stall, particularly in psychology and
social work, who might have the techni-
cal skills to assist you in your research.
Finally, hospital recreation specialists
have an obligation to report their find-
ings in professional meetings and to
begin to write more about research in
their journals. The challenge of im-
provement of our services to society
can be met by more fruitful participa-
tion in research activities. :g:
