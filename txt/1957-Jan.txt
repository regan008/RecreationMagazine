- OTTO TOD MALLERY died on December 16 in his seventy-
sixth year. He was struck by a car while taking an
evening stroll near his home in Philadelphia. Here ended
a life of splendid service to his fellow man. Mr. Mallery
was a creative thinker and a pioneer. While recreation was
closest to his heart, he was a man of many interests. He
was interested in and ready to do something about immedi-
ate, local problems but he was equally concerned with prob-
lems around the world. He gave generously of his time and
his substance at the local, national and international levels.
As.the late Howard Braucher, executive secretary and
president of .the National Recreation Association for many
years, once said: “Otto Mallery has been one of the great
leaders in the recreation movement nationally and locally
in Philadelphia. In his own life he has embodied the rec-
reation spirit, and he has been supremely gifted in inter-
preting it to others. It is on the farseeing, statesmanlike,
devoted, missionary spirit of persons like Otto Mallery that
the National Recreation Association and the movement as
a whole have been built.”

Mr. Mallery was a charter member of the Philadelphia
Playgrounds Association which later became the Philadel-
phia Recreation Association, one of the oldest active private
agencies in the recreation field having been formed just
six months after the National Recreation Association was
established. From 1907 to 1948 he served the Philadelphia
group actively, first as treasurer, then for many years as
president and since 1948 as chairman emeritus. In 1908
Mr. Mallery became the president of the Philadclphia Rec-
reation Commission, the first great stride toward making
recreation a municipal responsihility. At a luncheon in
Philadelphia on November 30, 1956, he was presentcd with
an official award by the City of Philadelphia, It paid tributc
to him as thc Father of Recreation in Philadelphia, a term
which has been applied to him on many occasions.

After serving four years on the Council of the Playground
Association of America, which later bccame the National
Recreation Association, Mr. Mallery was elected in 1912 to
the Board, upon which he served for the remainder of his
life. Thus he gave to this Association forty-eight years of
untiring service. Since 1951 he has served as chairman.

To Mr. Mallery goes the distinction of being the prime
mover in establishing the International Recreation Associa-
tion which was created at the International Recrcation Con-
gress in Philadelphia last October. He was a charter mem-
ber of its Board. He was active at the National Recreation
Congresses, including the International Recreation Con-
gress, being always ready to help.

Many public honors came to Mr. Mallcry and these were

Otto Tod Mallery

1880 - 1956

accepted with deference and humility, and. shared with
others with whom he was associated. Mr. Mallery’s man}
oHicial connections with government and private groups art
outlined in Who’s Who in America. Among these, he “'3:-
formerly senior business specialist of the United States De-
partment of Commerce. He served in 1937 as economit
advisor to the United States delegation to the International
Labor OHice, and later as consultant to the National Re-
sources Planning Board and as a member of the Adviser)
Committee of the National Youth Administration. For
several years he served on the Pennsylvania State Planning
Board. He was also a member of the Philadelphia City
Charter Committee which was instrumental in paving the
way for the splendid recreation system there.

Books written by Mr. Mallery inclnde Economic Union
and Durable Peace, 1943 and More Than Conquerors, 1947.
A major article, “Economic Union and Enduring Peace."
was written for the Annals of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, of which organization he SCI‘VCtl
as trustee. He was also founder and chairman of the Inter-
dependence Council, with Operations in forty-nine nations.
The council is dedicatcd to bringing people of various na-
tions together on the basis of those things upon which the)
can agree. It perfccted a “Declaration of Intcrdcpendcncc"
which was acted upon in the Philadelphia room whcrc the
Declaration of Independence was signed.

Graduating from Princeton University in 1902, Mr. Mal-
lery took graduate work at the University of Pcnnsylvania
and Columbia University. Always intcrested in music, he
played the bass viol in the family chamber music ensemble
in which his wife and four childrcn were the principal par-
ticipants. At a Rccrcation Congress in Atlantic City, l’ctcr
Dykema, music specialist, undcrtook to form a brass band
composed of Congress dclegatcs who had ncver touched
their respective instruments before. Mr. Dykcma quickly
demonstrated the rudimcnts of these instruments. hcl(l rc-
hcarsals and then dirccted two numbers pcrformed by the
group at one of the later scssions of the Congress. lt was
characteristic of Mr. Mallery that he participated in this
activity with great enthusiasm playing the trombone.

The recreation spirit was an inseparable part of Otto
Mallcry and he was one of its most giftcd lay intcrprctcrs.
Furnishing by his own life an example of outstanding vol-
unteer lay leadership, hc wrote in his editorial in the Golden
Anniversary Issue of RECREATION last June, “The ultimate
strength of the National Recrcation Association lies in the
devotion and civic spirit of thousands of lay men and women
on boards, committees, and foundations who steadily hold
tl1c line and keep advancing it.” 0

Roller Skating is the one sport in
which all your students can partic-
ipate. It handles large groups of
boys and girls quickly and easily,
and does not require a change of
clothes. The equipment is rela-
tively inexpensive. Little supervi-
sion is needed. That’s why more
and more schools are making roller
skating a definite part of their
physical education and recreation

programs.

1938 National Park Service publication
dealing with the design and construc-
tion of park and outdoor facilities, may
now be purchased from the Superin-
tendent Of Documents, Washington 25,

trated with construction plans and pho-
tographs, were reprinted because of ex-
tensive demand by builders and plan-
ners of parks and recreation areas. Do-

them a valuable source of information

> NEW CIIEMICAL CONTROL FOR POND
ALGAE has been tested on the five-acre
spring-fed lake at the Los Angeles
State and County Arboretum in Ar-
cadia. The lake has been ,cleansed of
surface algae by use of a special Chemi-
cal. Almost completely covered with a
heavy coating of algae, the surfacc of
the lake was made crystal clear within
a few days after spraying with a newly

dxeveloped fungicide known as Phygon-
L.

First use of Phygon-YL in California
was in irrigation canals, later in ponds.
It has cleared water for fishing, swim-
ming, boating and irrigation. So far,
the anti-algae Chemical does not appear
to have harmed the large stock of fish
in the arboretum lake.

For Recreation Students

Sirs:

l was quite interested in the sugges-
tion by Robert E. Coady of the Cincin-
nati, Ohio, Public Recreation Commis-
sion staff, in the April 1956 issue of
RECREATION, that colleges make more
extensive use of professional leaders to
help recreation majors prepare realis-
tically for the field.

When Jay Ver Lec* was superintend-
ent of recreation in Colorado Springs,
he and his staff worked quite closely
with the faculty at Colorado College in
preparing those students who were in-
terested in entering the profession, and
they were able to bring to the classes
experience and knowledge not found
in textbooks. As a former student of
Mr. Ver Lee, I can certainly endorse the
value of such outside professional
leaders.

* Mr. Ver Lee is currently superintendent
of recreation in Oakland, California.

SOMETHING NEW I

-—The Editors.

The Huntington Park Recreation De-
partment would very definitely be inter-
ested in such an exchange program as
suggested by Mr. Coady, and we should
be most happy to make ourselves avail-
able for such an assignment.

RALPH C. WILSON, Director 0/ Rec-
reation, Huntington Park, Cali-
fornia.

“Special Recreation” Staff

Sirs:

There is one suggestion I would like
to make in the area of recreation for
handicapped children. At present I am
conducting a five-year demonstration
recreation program' to integrate hear-
ing impaired children with normal
hearing children in recreation and so-
cial activities.

It has become apparent after a year
and a half that this type program. with
modifications. should concern itself
with all handicapped youngsters. At

this point, a problem confronts us.
Handicapped youngsters should not
have to be served by “demonstration”
or “pilot” programs but should be
served by permanent recreation pro-
grams that are provided for all children
in the community. Whose responsibil-
ity, then, is it to provide year-round
programs for these youngsters?

I sincerely believe that staff devoted
to “special recreation” should be in-
cluded in public departments of recrea-
tion throughout the country in order to
provide permanent recreation service to
as many handicapped youngsters as
possible. This staff would devote full
time to this program. I would be very
much interested in knowing if there are
any public recreation departments
which would give support to this type
program.

750 Recreation Books

Sirs:

l have in my possession a copy of A
Guide to Books on Recreation (RECRE-
ATION Part II, September 1956l which
is an annotated list of over seven hun-
dred and fifty books on this subject.
This would be invaluable to me in my
work; and if it is at all possible could
you send me three copies? The material
came to my attention through a rec-
reation major at tl1c University of Min-
nesota. who has been helping me set
up a recreation program.

A “Short Snorter"

Sirs:

\Vhile at the Second International
Congress in Philadelphia I had the
pleasure of attending the session en-
titled “International Exchange Pro-
gram for Recreation Leaders.”

In response to a request by Toni
Lantz, superintendent of public recrea-
tion in Tacoma, \Vashington, as to what
road we should take in this field of in-
ternational recreation exchange. some
very fine comments were made by par-
ticipants from the United States and
foreign countries. Personally I feel
very strongly about this entire project:
however, there is a question in my mind
regarding the best avenue of approach.

I have given the editor of your mag-
azine a dollar bill to start what l hope
will become the longest “short snorter"
in tl1c world—to be added to by as
many people as possible in the United
States and other countries all over the
world. My idea is that the entire sum

and the US. State Department, the best
and most practical method or plan of
achieving “Recreation through Peace-
creation,” or “Peace through Recrea-
tion,” or “How We Can Promote Better
International Understanding through
Recreation.” .

The following are a few of thc ques-
tions to be considered. Can it be
achieved:

1. Through the visits to this country of
foreign recreationists—on an annual
basis?

2. Through a mutual exchange where-
by recreationists of the United States
visit foreign countries?

3. Through an international organiza-
tion?

4. And what part should our govern-
ment play in this and what should be its
contribution?

If the “short snorter” does not mate-
rialize, please put my dollar into the
general fund.

Vallejo, California, has contributed.

The “Hi Fi’s”
Sirs:

Wasn’t the “Hi Fi” letter a fine one?
[From a teen-ager’s letter in Reporter’s
Notebook, October 1956 issue—Ed]
It supports my long-time contention
that these “Hi Fi” people (teen-agers)
are about the finest we have. They have
acquired the ability to reason and have
not, yet, developed some of our adult
bias and, yes, the unreasoning preju-
dices which we often acquire some-
where along the Iine. It is inspiring to
see how often the “Hi Fi” can come up
with the best and, even to adults, the
most desirable reaction to an opportu-
nity to produce.

1 like “Hi Fi,” and all of the implica-
tions it bears as to the actual, the real,
situation. The letter causes me to wish
even more that I might again try to be
a real “Hi Fi” and, since I have little
hope that such may be accomplished.
to at least be counted as a vociferous
fan in their cheering section.

Hogansville’s Sportsnlen’s Club, onee forbidden swainpland, is
now one of Georgia’s t0p recreation areas, thanks to the interest
and industry of its people, and local and state government.

They Built a Park

o

STRANGE REQUEST came to the wardens of Okefeno-
kee Swamp in southern Georgia a few years back. Could a
few alligators be shipped alive to west central Georgia near
the Alabama line?

It was all part of a plan eventually involving over three
hundred “Us.” [United States Rubber Company] em-
ployees, their neighbors and their families-——a plan that
turned forbidding swampland into a beautiful park and
bountiful game preserve. It happened in Hogansville, Geor-
gia, home.of the textile division’s Stark, Reid and Asbeston
plants; '

Today the onerhundred and twenty-acre area, including
seventy-five acres of lakes with some of the state’s best fish-

 

I 'l.'

“U.S."’ employees, such as the above, tacklcd the forbidding
terrain and details of the construction. Things moved quickly!

ing, goes under the more attractive name of the Tri-County
Sportsmen’s Club. Some of the original founders, however,
still refer to it nostalgically as “the mudholes.”

Tri-County’s site formerly was a collection of clay .pits in
operation between 1879 and 1929. In 1949 a group of local
wildlife enthusiasts were casting around for a game pre-
serve. Old-timers remembered the clay pits, now covered
by dense undergrowth and a veritable haven for wildlife
including some not-so-welconle inhabitants such as water
moccasins and copperheads. ,

Once decision was made that this was the spot, things
moved quickly. The tract’s owners agreed to sell for $750.
Funds for purchase were raised by the sixteen founders
(who organized the Sportsmen’s Club on October 1, 1949)
from their own savings and by borrowing from the local
bank, headed by one of the charter members. Within a year
membership swelled to 240, reaching 350 at the end of the
second year.

The members worked up a sweat regularly during the
next five years as swamp disappeared and the park emerged.
Working on Saturdays and holidays, armed with picks,
axes, shovels and bushhooks, thcy cleared out years of tan-
gled undergrowth, hacked pathways along the lake shores,
installed drainage ditches, bridged streams and low-lying
Swampland, and laid out picnic and play areas.

They opened the park in style with a real
Georgia barbecue and an old-fashioned
Brunswick stew served to jubilant builders.

During this time three dams and spillways were built to
insure water levels in the fishing area. The district game
commissioner, a club member, arranged with the director of
state hatcheries to stock the lakes with five thousand bass
to augment native catfish and bream. A county commis-
sioner, another Tri-County member, arranged for building a
connecting road from the highway to the tract.

All of this, of course, followed the snake hunt which, in
turn, involved acquisition of the nine alligators.

Open warfare had been declared on c0pperheads and
water moccasins and over four hundred were killed in two
years. The request for ’gators went out in the second phase
of this campaign because the amphibians were natural
enemies of snakes. They quickly put the finishing touches
on the reptile problem.

But they posed another problem. The ’gators, whose eyes
shone like red-hot coals at night and whose silent stalking

was thought to account for some missing dogs, also fright-
ened women and children and even gave menfolk creepy
feelings when they were seen in the park’s fishing area.

One by one, the alligators were captured and turned loose
in the nearby Chattahoochee, where they could make their
way back to warmer climes in south Georgia and Florida.

Physical improvements to add to the tract’s recreational
worth were next, once the land had been cleared and the
area’s natural beauties revealed. One member donated an
unused peach shed which became, along with other salvaged
materials, a big shelter complete with electricity and a dou-
ble outdoor fireplace. .

An unused former church building standing on U.S.
Rubber property was contributed by the company and used
for construction of a five-room caretaker’s cottage. Do-
nating valuable time and labor, plant employees also con-
structed a modern concrete and brick barbecue pit and out-
door grill. Enlarging the park and picnic grounds, the club
purchased and erected strong, durable playground equip-
ment—swings, slides, seesaws, a merry-go-round, and so
on; and when dad purchased a boat with an outboard motor,
there was additional fun for all the family.

In time even more improvements were added. Up-to-date
outdoor fireplaces, brick and concrete picnic tables, benches
and porch-type swings, concrete dance pavilion with house
for music box, a concession building and toolshed, an elec-
tric pump for the well, shelters along the lake shores, and
better toilet facilities.

Turning a forbidden and forgotten swamp into this thing
of beauty was an effort in the highest order of community
relations. Besides, the people of “US.” say, it was fun. 0

> After extensive conferences and correspondence with leaders of youth
and other recreation agencies, government and non-government, in all parts
of the world;
> And in response to a resolution from a group of nineteen foreign authori-
ties responsible for recreation and youth services in thirteen countries,
brought to America by the United States Department of State to study the
recreation movement of America;
> And after formal request by the International Advisory Committee of
the International Recreation Congress organized to aid in conducting this
world gathering of recreation leaders;
> And after the approval of the National Advisory Committee on Inter-
national Recreation Service, NRA, a group of forty-six professional rec-
reation authorities representing the professional recreation movement in
America;
> And with the active leadership and support of the National Recreation
Association (U.S.A.), a national citizen agency which for fifty years has
served the recreation forces of America;

The International Recreation Association has bcen organized to provide, on a coopera-
by live basis, urgently ncedcd international recreation services under an international board of
directors, with the participation and cooperation of recreation agencies in other countries.
Recrcation services provided to other countries thus will no longer be solely the extcnsion
Thomas work of one country’s recreation agency, but will comc from this international voluntary
clearing house, managed by an international board of dircctors and supported by many

E. countries. _

. Lord Luke of Pavenham, internationally known industrialist and president of the Na-
RIVCIS tional Playing Fields Association of England, was clected chairman of the Board of Di-

Opel of Germany, General Carlos Romulo of the Philippines, Staff Major Kanial I‘ll-Din
Hussein of Egypt, Ynkio Kagayama of Japan.

A sixth vice-president is to bc choscn from South Amcrica. Also the organization will
Genera] begin its service with an extraordinray' group scrving on its board of directors, the organi-

zation of which is not yet complcte. Those already selccted are listed on next page.

THERE ARE several mediums of com-
munication in any community with
which the recreation department needs
a close rapport. These include radio,
television and the newspaper. A close
working relationship with each is nec-
essary if a recreation department is to
reach and serve its entire constituency;
but, with none is this rapport more im-
portant than with the local newspaper.

The warp and woof of the average
community, particularly in non-metro-
politan areas, is continually affected by
the editorial policy of the local news-
paper. The minds, interests, and there-
fore the emotions, of a community can
be dramatically influenced by continual
contact with what is down “in black

paper in our area.

The phrase “at nearly any cost” is not
meant to imply.that such cooperation is
difficult to obtain. In most cases, the
personnel of the paper is only too glad
to work closely with the recrcation
staff. They are as concerned as we are
about doing the best possiblc job. They
seek news—the who, where, when, why
and what—of events in their area. What
is more important, they sincerely ap-
preciate any assistance we can givc
them.

This eliminates thc hypocritical person

The recreation departmcnt staff in

of appreciation to the personnel of the
local paper. We know a large portion of
our success is the result of their assist-
ance. The clippings shown here give
evidence that newspapers are willing to
promote the public recreation program.

To illustrate, here is an account of
what one paper has done. The Hanford
Sentinel is published six days a week,
with an average of twelve to fourteen
pages. The community, of some 11,000
people, is a county seat and the paper
is the only daily in the county. This
means that it cannot occupy itself solely
with the life of one community, but
must cover the county.

With this-in mind, copies of the paper
\vere‘chgcked to find out how much cov-
erage thlenrecreation department had re-
ceived during one year. We found that,
during 1955, there were 312 separate
articles concerning recreation projects,
and activities. Eighty of
these articles were on the front page,
some under baniier lines. Eight favor-
able editorials J’discussed, promoted,
and complimented the local! recreation
program." There were seventy-six pic-
tures of various events. The total cov-
erage was 3,029 column inches in twelve
months. At the prevailing local rate for
display ads—$1.05 per column inch-—-—
the~ local " department had received
$3,180.45 worth of space during 1955
without charge. At no time during this
period did anyone in the department
strive to have a record-breaking year
for publicity.

programs,

The newspaper cosponsored two rec-
reation department projects during the
year. One was solicitation of funds to
build a $3,500 addition to a newly pur-
chased recreation center. As a direct
result of this campaign, some $1,800
in cash and materials were donated.
The emphasis of the paper stimulated
a wave of donated labor, resulting in
the project being completed without re-
course to tax money.

The second project was a six-week
puzzle contest, originated by the recrea-
tion director. This contest, cospon-
sored by the newspaper and the rec-
reation department, literally provided
thousands of hours of citizen recreation
for the community. The paper put up
$250 in cash prizes, plus the hundreds
of column inches necessary to cover it.
It was a tremendous success, and would
have been utterly impossible Without
the wholehearted support of the press.

The puzzle, a combination of “Scrab-
ble” and a crossword puzzle, was
printed each week. The first puzzle had
a simple diagram and each succeeding
one had a more elaborate design with
a higher possible score. We called the
contest “Scriboscore” and used this
word as the basis around which we ar-
ranged each diagram. Each letter had
a point value and the object was to fill
in the puzzle to obtain the highest pos-
sible score.

In each of the first five puzzles, the
winner received $15 for attaining the
highest score, plus a bonus of fifty per

cent if his score tOpped that of the rec-
reation director—providing he was a
subscriber to the paper. The sixth and
culminating prize was $100, with the
same possible bonus. (The recreation
director was beaten five times.)

Obviously, the paper boosted its cir-
culation with the contest; but, the horn
of the recreation department was also
loudly blown, and it received much
good will' from the project.

Throughout the year, the varied pro-
gram of the department was supported
by full coverage in the news columns.
Special events were stimulated by pic-
tures and editorial comment. The sea-
sonal sports programs received excep-
tional support. The paper continually
extended itself to arouse interest and
urge attendance, thus assuring full use
of the taxpayer’s dollar.

The above is mentioned simply to
illustrate the cooperation which news-
papers are willing to give if properly
approached. A hesitant, apologetic re-
luctance to seek the full cooperation of
the newspaper is simply damming
(spell it as you will) the channel of
one’s opportunities.

Recreation departments have some-
thing to offer the niewspapers and they,
in turn, certainly have much for us. One
helps the other. Therefore, let us go all-
out to cement a relationship between
the department and the newspaper
which will bless the taxpayer, serve the
citizen, stifle the critic, and further
good will for all. 0

BELIEVING that the best way to serve one’s self is to serve
" others, the youth club in Algoma, Wisconsin, has
consistently stressed this theme, and the young people have
eXpressed as much, possibly even more, interest in “doing
for others” as in planning and carrying out activities for
their own entertainment.

The adult leaders and advisors of the club find that this
principle is much more conducive to organizational long-
life and the sustained interest of the young people them-
selves than the purely “youth center” idea. They believe
that the best way to prevent an early demise is to have
definite objectives, a job to do. They feel it necessary to
pause for redefinition of this objective from time to time,
but the goal is always to find a job and then do it.

Each activity is a project in itself, something which can
be completed in a relatively short period of time. No one,
young people especially, has any particular interest in or
gets any particular pleasure out of long range projects. The

turnover in youth-group membership is high, making long-
range projects impractical.

Thc Algoma Youth Club’s long life is something of a
record. It has been in operation without a break since
February, 1944. Starting in a small unused city-owned

room, it two years latcr graduated into larger rented quar-
ters; and in the summer of 1955 the city council provided
one of the largest and finest buildings in the state for this
purpose. Now called The Dug-Out, it has a large youth
center room, gymnasium-auditorium, arts and crafts and
meeting areas totaling almost 16,000 square feet of floor
space. The huilding is on the shore of Lake Michigan.

The club is sponsored by and functions under thc super-
vision and guidance of the Algoma Departmcnt of Recrea-
tion, Parks and Playgrounds in a city of less than 4,000
population. Community interest and hacking, so essential
to any youth program, is evidenced by funds for rcmodcl-
ing and maintenance, and city residents have contributed
all club furnishings from table games and billiard tables
to bowling alleys, television set, public address system. a
new, modern juke box and a sound movie projector.

liECREATTOX

 

Workshop at the rally demonstrates home manufae-
ture of arrows. Program has something for everyone.

The over-all planning always calls for a balanced pro-
gram to provide for a wide variety of individual interests;
and the leadership is chosen by the members themselves.
This is a selection which is respected and carries with it the
necessary contagious enthusiasm.

The service theme was highlighted by the 1955 CARE
fund-raising project which started with a goal of $50.00 and
resulted in more than twice that sum in the two weeks al-
lotted for the work. It won the club the World Week citi-
zenship award and Parents Magazine Youth Group Achieve-
ment Award.

The CARE project got under way with the appointment
of a general committee, which was broken down into sub-
committees to conduct the various phases of the campaign.
The fund-raising projects included: a bake sale for which
the young people themselves did a great deal of actual food
preparation; a no-cxpense jukebox dance; a snow shovel-
ing project wherein dcsignated “gangs” voluntarily shov-
eled private walks, for a contrihution to the club’s CARE
fund; a huge glass bowl in the center for the deposit of
cash which would ordinarily have been spent at the snack
bar; and a rag pick-up, with city residents requested to
place containers of rags and old clothing at the curb.

Other service projects have included a Christmas dance
at which admission was a canned or packaged food item.
All the admissions were boxed and delivered to needy fain-
ilies in the area. The club also organized and sponsored a
Christmas-Carol Parade in which almost all of the civic and
church organizations of the city participated, with live
floats depicting scenes from the various carols without any
sort of prize or award other than personal satisfaction.

Another holiday project was an attempt to make sure,
through personal visits to practically every home on a block-
worker basis, that any and all newcomers and visitors were
made part of the community and its life.

A “Courteous Driver” contest awarded prizes and certi-
ficates to courteous teen-age drivers and letters of censure
to teen-agers who were observed violating rules of driving
courtesy. Observations and judging were made by a “secret”
committee appointed from the club membership. The state

motor vehicle department commended the project and the
Algoma police department requested that it be repeated.

Other projects have included an Americanism essay con-
test, a “Why Vote?” essay contest, participation in March of
Dimes, Heart Fund, ground observer corps—with over sixty
members volunteering for regular assignment—~a program
of entertainment presented at the county home for needy.
and Brotherhood Week. Sponsorship of a youth rally with
the accent on wholesome leisure time activities and good
citizenship has been an annual event. More fund-raising
projects of the club include a public variety show which
draws three capacity houses each year, sale of Christmas
trees and decorations, an ice cream social, pancake supper
and similiar events.

The club center offers such participation activities as
orchestra and record dances, billiards, table tennis, roller
skating, basketball, archery, volleyball, indoor softball and
others. Clubs within the club provide for specialized activ-
ities such as arts and crafts, music, drama and nature.
There also are special excursion trips, luncheons and din—
ners, all types of athletic leagues, ice skating parties, swim-
ming, golf, special holiday parties, cabaret dances, socials

and picnics, and a weekly hour-long radio program.

Even with all this, adult leaders feel that were it not for
the interest in “doing unto others,” the thirteen-year ex-
istence of the organization would have been in jeopardy
many times. This service spirit was typified again when the
club’s youth council chose as its 1956 Christmas project
the raising of the $180.00 necessary for adoption of a need)
youth through the Foster Parents’ Plan for War Children.

Using past experience as a criterion, we’re sure that the
young members undoubtedly will meet the necessary quota
and will make such adoption a personal matter, with an
exchange of letters and personal gifts above and beyond
their financial contribution. They .know that this type of
interest and activity assures many more benefits than purely
self-centered interests. The good will so necessary for com-
munitylsupport and backing and for sustained club life is
put into practice, and the personal satisfaction of being
useful, which all teen-agers crave, is the result.* .

MUSICAL GAMES used by leaders and counselors——-at bunk
parties or during rainy days at camp, in the center
meeting rooms as clubs wait for meetings to begin, and in
many informal settings—can be activities as ends in them-
selves. As such, they can help groups to get acquainted,
provide emotional outlets, develop skills, strengthen inter-
personal relations and the “we” feeling.

Some games can be even more than ends in themselves;
they can serve as jumping OE points for creative activities
in the related arts: pantomime, dance, and dramatic im-
provisation.

By their very nature some games call upon simple ele-
ments of free eXpression: “Do the action the music suggests”
(see Game III, Variation Two below) ; “Tap out the rhythm
of a conversation” (Game II, Variation Two); “Make a
sketch of a song title we’re to guess” (Game VI, Form Two).
Any one of these can develop into f ullblown creative activity,
with firm purposes and direction.
~ Moreover, members having fun playing a game together
are comfortable and relaxed. It is during these moments
of freedom from tension that conditions are most favorable
for emotional expression, for the use of imagination and

inventiveness.

There is room for a great deal of flexibility in the way
each game may be used so that, through the selection of
the song, the word, or the action, it may be related to the
interests of the group. The leader’s approval of the use of
the phrase “rock and roll’ for Game IV may be the touch
'needed to help one particular teen-age group relax. The
selection of music for Games I, II, III, and IV, can meet a
variety of tastes, can create a mood, can be suggestive of
holidays and other experiences.

Games which are marked as being usable in small groups
and by various ages (Games I, II, III, and V) are recom-
mended for family programing. Adaptation of the games
to various ages will increase the repertoire: a teen-age game
which would be a loss to a children’s group, if played as
described, becomes usable with'simple adaptations. Some
variations are outlined; others will suggest themselves.

Q a

Leaders and counsfelors are urged to encourage members
and campers to suggest variations. When a group is famil-
iar with a game, thevleader’s question, ’“In what other ways
can this be played?” will stimulate shme to find new ap-
proaches and new uses, and can open the floodgates of
imagination.

I. MUSICAL ICE-BREAKER. Size of group: 20 to 200. Age:
Children through older adults. ,.

The leader, knowing how many are to be present, decide's
upon the number of teams into which he will divide the
group. If, for example, there are to be fifty people, he may
want to work toward five teams of ten each. He then decides
upon five familiar songs, and writes one title on each of ten

' pieces of paper, another on each of ten other slips, and so on.

Upon arriving, each person is given one piece of folded
paper on which a title is written. At the signal, all begin
walking about the room, each singing his own given song.
Those singing the same song find each other, and credit is
given for teams which get together first.

Variation One: Pantomime. Size of group: 20 to 200. Age:
Children eight to twelve (all ages if pe0ple know each
other).

Each person not only sings his given song, but also acts
out one aspect of it, while looking around to see who else is
pantomiming the same song.

Variation Two: Mixed group size 20 to 200. Age: Pre-
teens through older adults.

To use this game as a way of setting up couples, enough
songs are selected in advance so that each couple is given
its own song title. Each person seeks someone singing the
same song. Each song title should be written on only two
cards of different colors, one color for girls, one for boys.

11. THE BEAT-TIIE-RHYTIIM GAME. Size of group: 4 to 25.
Age: Children of four through older adults.

The leader taps out the first phrase of a familiar song, giv-
ing the group a cue as to its general type: folksong, popular
song, opera, and so on. The person who recognizes the song
is asked to start it. Since the song is to he a familiar one,
all he needs to do is sing the first note; everyone can pick
it up. The leader encourages all to join in. They sing as
much of the song as desired. The person who guesses the
first song now has the next turn at tapping out or clapping
the rhythm of another song which the group is to guess.
If he cannot think of one immediately, the leader can say:

 

RECREATION

(1 Their Creative Use

For leaders and counselOrs of groups—in camps, schools, public or private ‘

l

recreation organizations, institutions, churches, industries, service clubs.

“While you’re thinking of one, will someone else give us
a rhythm?” This is suggested so that no one will ever feel
the pressure of being “put on the spot.”

With a group larger than six peOple, a patter such as:
“This is a (type of song). Ready?” will help to focus
attention so that the tapping will be clearly heard.

When used with children, it is suggested that the songs
he very familiar ones, preferably those being currently sung
by the group.

Variation One: Rhythms. Size of group: 6 to 12. Age:
Children four to ten.

A rhythmic pattern can also suggest the name of a person.
The leader might ask: “Whose name am I tapping (or
clapping)?” If he claps light, light, light, heavy, it might
be Sylvia Green. If he claps heavy, light, heavy, light, he
might mean Henry Goldberg, and so forth. The group
guesses. Then the leader asks for a volunteer to call out a
series of names of people in the group. One at a time, as
the child calls each name, someone else or all volunteer to
clap its rhythm. Then, after a while, when this is clearly
understood, felt, and enjoyed, the leader suggests trying to
stay with one pattern and repeating it. For example, for
John Silver: heavy, hold, light, light; heavy, hold, light,
light. If the name is repeated again and again, while all do
the clapping, a rhythmic movement suggests itself. If all
then stand when there is open floor space, children will take
turns improvising movements to the rhythm.“ They can play
“follow-the-leader,” or each might show and enjoy his own
movement. This can be the beginning of the group creation
of a dance.

Variation Two: Creative Music. Size of group: 6 to 12.
Age: Children four to eleven.

A rhythm pattern might also suggest a phrase of words.
The leader claps a sentence, asking what it suggests. Heavy,
light, light, light, heavy might suggest to a child: “I don’t
want to go!” If the leader asks, “Why?” another child
might answer by clapping and speaking: “I’m too tired.”

The leader can here again begin to encourage a dramatic
improvisation of a scene developing a situation. Why is

the child tired? What has he been doing? What does he

want? If the children can be encouraged to improvise a

melody to the phrases, instead of just speaking them, we-

soon have an improvised opera—the clapping can be for-
gotten, and each actor is making up tunes to express the
progress of the story.

Through this eXperience the group can learn that opera
is a play with music helping to establish the mood; that

music is another way of expressing feelings and ideas; that
music talks.

III. HOT AND COLD. For Action. Size of group: 6 to 35.
Age: Pre-teens through older adults.

With “It” out of the room, the players decide upon an
action which they would like him to follow in connection
with a selected second person in the room; for example,
they want him to walk tooHelen and take off her glasses.

When _“It” is called in, the group begins to sing any
song of its choosing. “It” begins to walk around the room.
As he comes close to the person selected, and is therefore
“hot,” they sing loudly; as he passes or moves away, get-
ting “cold,” they sing softly. The loud music guides him
to the right person. Once there, he must try different ac-
tions, until, with the help of the music (loud as he gets closer
to the right action, and soft if he is missing it) he dis-
covers the action the group wants him to do.

Variation One: Size of group: 6 to 35. Age: Young adults,
adults, and older adults.

Group decides to try to get “It” to do something with
another person, such as dancing or picking up an object and
moving it elsewhere. (Caution: It is wise to make the rules
of this variation clear before “It” leaves the room.)
Variation Two: Size of group: 10 to 35. Age: Children
seven to ten.

“It” is told that when he comes in the group will want
him to dance with a special person. He is to find the person
through the “loud” and “soft” singing of the group.

Another possible direction might be: “When you find
the partner we have selected for you, you are to skip (or
march, or trot, or do the action the piano or record suggests)
with this partner,” or “Play follow the leader with the per-
son you find,” in which case the partner improvises rhyth-
mic movement to music which “It” is to follow.

IV. THE THREE-SYLLABLE WORD GAME. Size of group: 15
to 50. Age: Children eight through older adults.

With “It” out of the room, the. group selects a three-
syllable word; for example, “pho-to-graph.” The players
are then divided into three sections, each to chant its own
syllable to any tune; for example, “Yankee Doodle.” Sec-
tion A sings the first syllable only, fitting it to the tune;
Section B the second; and Section C the third. All sing at

once, not loudly, using the same melody and following one
leader. “It” is ealled in. He listens, watches the lips of the
singers, and tries to recognize the word.

Variation One: Size of group: 15 to 50. Age: Pre-teens to
adults.

As they become familiar with the game, players like to
“seramble” syllables; for example, Seetion A ehants the
last syllable, Section B the first, Seetion C the middle one.
Variation Two: Size of group: 6 to 12. Age: Pre-teens
and teen-agers.

In this variation, suggested and used by Sheila Fleisch-
mann, the group decides upon a phrase giving a direetion
for something they want “It” to do upon his return to the
room, using as many words as there are people in the
group; for example, if there are ten in the group, the phrase
might be, “Please go to the door, then turn out the light.“
Eaeh person sitting in the eirele .chants his word to the
tune selected, all singing at once, and not loudly. “It” tries
to reeognize the direetion being sung and follow it.
Variation T Izree: With Pantomime. Size of group: 12 to 24.
Age: Pre-teen through young adult.

In this variation, suggested and used by Aaron Krasner,
the group is divided into several sections, each going to its
own corner to select a slogan with as many words as there
pe0ple in the group; for example, “A rolling stone gathers
no moss.” At a given signal, the members of Group One
begin to ehant, eaeh his own word, but all singing _the same
melody together. Members of the other two groups watch,
listen, and try to determine the slogan.

If they do not find the correct answer, the group does it
again; this time eaeh aets out his word as he ehants. The
effeet is amusing, because each person is pantomimng
something else: and if all are relaxed, it can be a lot of fun.

V. CATEGORIES. Size of group: 10 to 35. Age: Children
eight through older adults.

The group is divided into teams. All are givcn five
minutes to list song titles for eaeh of several catcgories;
for example, foods, seasons, Bible, weather, Sabbath.

Then, at the given signal, the leader asks one of the teams
to sing a song in the first category. Before the song .is fin-
ished, the leader ealls on another team for a song in the
same eategory, then another team, and so on.

The team ealled must respond at once, and no repeats are
allowed. The leader deeides the most appropriate time to go
on to the next eategory.

This game ean be used to motivate the learning of new
songs in eategories for which their repertoire is felt to be
limited. With certain groups, the leader’s remark: “If you
were writing a song in the category of weather, what would
you want to say?” might lead to writing an original song.

VI. WHAT’S MY TITLE? Size of group 8 to 50. Age: Chil-
dren ten through older adults.

The object of the game is to suggest titles of familiar

20

songs through dramaties, art, or storytelling. The group
tries to guess the titles. With alert leadership, the guessing
is followed by singing.

Form One: With Charades.

If the group is small, a charade representing the song
title ean be planned by an individual or a team, on the spot.
If the eharades are used for mass aetivity, they are best
planned and rehearsed by a committee, a elub or a bunk.
in advanee of the program.

Forrn Two: With Sketehes or Painting.

A group no larger than about twenty-five is divided into
teams of no less than four eaeh. Teams are in the eorners of
the room. One representative of each team goes to the center
of the room, where all representatives, simultaneously, are
given a song title by the leader. Each returns to his team
and begins to sketch 3 picture of the meaning of the song
as efieetively and quiekly as possible, without speaking to
anyone. The team which guesses the song title first, and
ean sing the song, wins the most points. .

If this game is used for a mass aetivity, a eommittee pre-
pares paintings representing songs which are in the reper-
toire of the group, in advanee of the program. The audience
is to guess the song titles. The singing whieh aecompanies
the guessing always seems to have the flavor of spontaneity.
Form Three: With Creative Storytelling.

If the group is small, each person writes the name of a
familiar song on a piece of paper and keeps it. The leader
begins an improvised story which, after a minute or two.
suggests the song on his paper, preferably one very familiar '
to the group. When the song is named correctly, everyone
sings it. Group members then voluntcer, when ready, to pick
up on the story, each leading to an event or a statement
which suggests the song on his paper. An alert group
guesses the eorreet song and sings it.

If this game is to be used for a mass aetivity, a story
suggesting a series of familiar songs is written in advance
by an individual, a committee, a group. It is presented by
the writer or writers; the audience guesses which song is
being suggcsted by eaeh episode and sings it.

VII. A Hrr PARADE or Favour“: Soxcs.

A hit parade of favorite songs ean serve as the program
for a mass activity of a group that has a common repertoire
of songs (closing banquet at camp, and so on). A com-
lnittee decides upon ten songs whieh are favorites and pre-
pares a mimeographed “ballot,” illustrated if possible. Each
member marks the ballot aecording to favorites: he marks
his top favorite, his second, and so on. All know that the
results will be announced at the mass activity. As the pro-
gram starts, only a small committee knows the outcome of
the elcetion. With due fanfare, the master of eeremonies
announces “Song Hit Number Ten”; the group sings it:
then number nine, and so on, until finally. after due sus-
pense, the top favorite is reached. 0

Programs

on Exhibition

January is a good time to think of ways of publicizing recreation pro-
grams. A series of miniature exhibits, developed by Catherine Simpson of
the recreation department of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, dramatizes the
recreation facilities, programs and holiday celebrations. Our write-up is
based upon seeing colored slides and may not do them justice—but the idea

is here for you to devel0p.

Such an exhibit of miniatures can go on tour, is perfect for a bank, library
or store window; makes a vivid table decoration at a banquet; will liven up
a board meeting. Here are a few ideas. Add your own—and get your craft

groups busy!

EACH LITTLE exhibit or diorama re-
quires a Hat wood or plastic foam
base, about twelve inches square, and
a small, branched tree limb or twig. Ar-
ranging and decorating these is a very
interesting project. Small accessories
can be made or purchased from novelty
shops or dime stores. A white card set
in front of each exhibit contains perti-
nent information and identification.

For Holidays and Special Days

Easter. The small tree, anchored to the
white tissue-paper covered base, is dcc-
orated with tiny Easter hats and cutout
paper lanterns. A little nest, filled with
colored gumdr0p eggs, is placcd at the
base of the tree.

Halloween. The tree is anchored to a
corner of the base, which is covered
with straw. Small black paper cats dcc-
orate the tree, and several
stones,” cut from plastic foam, arc scat-
tered underneath. A black paper spook
peers out from behind each tombstone.
Thanksgiving. The small tree, left bare,
is attached to a corner of the base. Un-
der the tree is a tiny table set with platcs
and silverware. A pipe-cleaner figurc

“tomb-

of a Pilgrim woman holds a turkey.
Christmas. A conventional evergreen
Christmas tree is trimmed with tiny
candycanes, miniature balls, glitter, and
other baubles. Under it may be a creche,
Santa and reindeer, toys, or so on.

Valentine’s Day. The tree is painted
white and hung with tiny red hearts. The

JANUARY 1957

base is covered with a gold or silver
paper d‘oily cut to fit. Two pipe-cleaner
figures or dolls, one a boy and the other
a girl, exchange hearts.

Other Program Activities

Snow Play. The base of plastic foam,
or wood covered with plastic foam, has
a tree in one corner decorated with
bits of cotton to simulate snow. Small
twigs of evergreen dot the base, inter-
spersed with some pipe-cleaner figures
on skis while smaller ones tumble in
the “snow.”

Music. The base is covered with metal-
lic paper. The tree, in the center, is
painted gold and covered with angel
Under the tree is a miniature
grand piano with a pipe-cleaner pianist.
Swimming. The base is covered with
green matting or paper simulating
grass. The tree, in one corner, is dec-
orated with small Howers. Diagonally

across from the tree is a small pan,
painted blue inside and filled with
water, to represcnt a pool. In the pool

are several small dolls, celluloid or rub-
ber, for swimmers and a tiny beachball.
Football. The base is -covered with
green matting or paper for turf. The
tree, in a corner, is decorated with tiny
pennants in college colors. On the other
side of the base is a goalpost in two
colors. Two teams of pipe-cleaner foot-
ball players are in playing positions,
with a miniature football between them.
Basketball. Similar to football, except

for a miniature basketball goal, on a
pole, with groups of pipe-cleaner bas-
ketball players under it.

Art. The tree is decorated with small
flowers and underneath it is a miniature
easel and pipe-cleaner artist in smock
and beret.

Folk Dancing. The tree is decorated
with little lanterns and pipe-cleaner or

doll figures in folk costumes dance be-
neath it.

Picnics. The tree is decorated with bits
of colored yarn to simulate autumn foli-
age. Underneath is a miniature picnic
table and bench, a tiny make-believe
fire or outdoor fireplace. Pipe-cleaner
figures are at the table and the fire.

Lantern Parade. The tree is decorated
with small lanterns. A pan of water
with a white edge around it simulates
a lake. Small pipe-cleaner figures hold-
ing tiny paper lanterns are marching
around it.

Nature. The tree covered with tiny blos-
soms is placed in the center. A small
bird or 'butterfly sits on a twig. The
base is covered with green matting or
paper to indicate grass. Miniature ani-
mals—squirrels, rabbits, deer—are un-
der the tree.

Drama. The tree is painted silver and
the base is covered with glossy white
paper. On it is a little platform, made
from a small box, covered with black
paper. Several pipe-cleaner figures are
“on stage.”

Similar miniature dioramas can de-
pict various playground activities, pup-
pet shows, storytelling, boating and
fishing, senior citizenwactivities, c'arol-
ing, all your community’s own special
events (pageants, fairs, festivals, and
so on). Other exhibits can show mini-
ature models of community center
buildings, band shells and other rccrea-
tion structures. You can even have a
miniature board meeting in action. 0

Do you, as a recreation or park
executive, think in terms of
dollars or of human values?

Some Yardstieks-
for Relating Participation to Costs*

ONE OF THE DIFFICULT tasks of the recreation profession
is to shift the basis of fiscal thinking, both our own and
that of the general public, from dollars to human values.
If we are in business in order to bring about favorable
changes in the lives of people, then our sights should be set
on the ends to be achieved—the values derived from our
services—rather than on the means to those ends as repre-
sented by dollars in the budget. The budget itself is a nec-
essary tool of good administration—but nothing more than
a tool.

Virtually everyone engages in some recreation with rea-
sonable regularity. The only person who doesn’t is a hermit,
who is continually doing only what he chooses to do. Most
people can do only some of the things they want to do for
their recreation; and therein lies both the obligation and
the opportunity of the recreation leader. It is his job to
make it possible for people to enjoy the activities they
desire. If this premise is sound, the leader cannot measure
his success in terms of numbers reached, but by the effects
of his services,on individual human lives.

A woman I know has been confined for some years to a
wheelchair by arthritis. Two years ago, in order to broaden
her horizon a bit, her husband took her with him to a week-
long recreation leadership institute. During that week, an
artist on the staff aroused her interest in painting—with the
result that her whole life has been affected by her newly
discovered ability to capture some of the beauty around her.
This illustrates the impact of recreation opportunity on an
individual human life. Think of the human and social values
to be gained from such guidance. They are clearly those of
a qualitative nature.

Can such values be measured by a standard based on the
proportion of total government operating cost devoted to
parks and recreation? Can it be said that an executive is
doing five-sixths of a maximally effective ob is he_is spend-

ing five dollars per capita for parks and recreation as com-
pared with the desirable standard of six dollars per capita?
Without doubt, the executive who is using up five per cent
of his city’s total operating budget and is spending close to
six dollars per capita for parks and recreation services is
likely to be achieving some of the human values illustrated.
At the same time, it is quite possible for him to be spending
all of these funds on a small portion of the pe0ple in his
community. These two yardsticks —proportion of total
operating costs of government and per capita costs for parks
and recreation—are the commonly accepted standards; yet
they are manifestly insuiiicient for measuring the impact of
the services on the lives of people. Let’s examine some
other possibilities.

As our civilization becomes urbanized and our urban cen-
ters become more and more congested, pe0ple are losing
contact with the soil. The good earth is the source of man’s
food, clothing, shelter, and even his spiritual sustenance;
yet it is possible today for a person to live his whole life
without direct personal contact with the natural.environ-
ment. In the cities one can walk for blocks without even

 

seeing the earth. In smaller towns, Mr. Citizen rides to his
business, day after day, at speeds which effectually prevent
any close examination or real understanding of those parts
of the natural environment which he cannot help but see.
Small wonder it is that he gains little appreciation of the
importance of natural resources, such as soil and water and
forests, except as these resources continue to make possible

Rapids, Michigan.

the production of things he needs. Small wonder it is that
he protests feebly, if at all, when someone proposes taking
a park, carefully preserved for the use of all, as a site for a
school or a reservoir or an industry.

Do you suppose this same Mr. Citizen would let his home

be taken arbitrarily just because someone else happened to .

want it? He wouldn’t give it up without a fight. It has
meaning for him; he understands its significance in terms of
security for himself and his family. By the same token,
should we not recognize it as part of our professional re-
sponsibility to attach meaning to the soil and the resources
it provides for man? Do we not, as a profession, have an
obligation to preserve the heritage which furnishes a major
part of the human satisfactions we choose to call recreation?
I think we do!

Let’s look for a moment then at the means of translating
these natural resource values into human values. Perhaps
it offers us a standard of value not expressed in dollars.
To what extent does your program afford opportunity for
camping experience? Are you encouraging and working
with school authorities to afford school camping for chil-
dren? How about family camping, or camping for older
adults, all proven feasible in the last decade? Do you pro-
vide garden plots where people can regain some sense of
dependence on the soil? How often do you use nature
materials such as rocks, lichens, vines, bark, or the colors
and designs in nature as the basis for handcrafts? Here,
it seems to me, is a significant yardstick for measuring ef-
fcctiveness of a recreation program: Does it include experi-
ences which foster understanding of man’s dependence on
the soil?

Another such yardstick might be the degree to which the
individual is encouraged and aided to develop his own rec-
reation. Just think for a moment of all the pe0ple who have
not been attracted by our organized recreation activities or
are not able to engage in group activities. Are not these
people a part of our constituency and thereby a part of our
professional responsibility? Here are the retired person.
the shut-in, the handicapped youngster, the busy executive
or housewife who need recreation outlets to give them thc
particular kind of satisfactions they happen to want. Be-
yond this, there is the generation growing up today which
might be characterized as recreationally helpless or, at least.
in danger of becoming so. Their chores are done largely by
machines; many of the pastimes provided for them are
in the form of television, movies, and spectator events.

The important question is: How much is the recreation
profession doing to help people develop their own personal
forms of recreation? Are you giving families any direct
assistance in planning the vacations for which they now
have time and money? ’Do you offer program planning aid
to organizations which wish to put on their own play ses-
sions? Do you encourage clubs and leagues you have helped
cstablish to become independent, so they may have the ex-
perience of doing for themselves and so your professional
leadership may be free to work with others? Are meeting
places provided for hobby groups? Do you make available
a workshop where the antique hound can refinish a spool bed
or where the budding archcr can make his own bow and

24-

arrows? Do you regularly reach into the homes of the com-
munity by means of radio, television, newspapers and other
publicity media with interest-arousing ideas and instructions
to encourage people to develop their own personal recrea-
tion? Here, then, is still another yardstick of effectiveness
for recreation services based on human values rather than _
costs.

The extent to which family solidarity is fostered by the
services of the recreation department might be a further
yardstick of effectiveness. The family is the basic biological-
social and economic unit of our society; yet the forces which
are tending to smash this social atom seem to become in-
creasingly stronger. Daily work, school attendance, social
or club engagements, movies draw family members away

 

from home. Radio and television invade the home and dis-
tract attention from family concerns. If we, as members
of a profession, hold the values of family life to be impor-
tant, then we certainly should do something about it. In-
deed, there are few professions in a position to make such an
impact on family life as that of recreation.

What help in the way of family-group recreation is offcred
by your department: for devices and simple facilities lt‘
make a backyard a recrcation place, for stay-at-home evc-
nings, for family parties, games, projects. fun? Does your
office or your public library have a supply of up-to-date
refercnces or books on these subjects? Arc your neighbor-
hood recreation centers designed and equipped for family
recreation? ls your staff at these centers competent and
interested enough to encourage family-group participation?
What do you offer as inducement to family groups (such as
family rates, for example) to encourage their attendance at
spectator events? Do you offer enough variety of recreation
opportunities at your centers so there is something for every
member of the family at appropriate times, and thus foster
a common interest in recreation within the family circle?

Hcrc, then, are three possible yardsticks for appraising
the effectiveness of recreation services in terms of human
values rather than dollars. We might express them this
way:

0 Does your budget rcflect opportunities which bring pcoplc
in contact with the soil?

0 Does your budget reflect services which encourage self-
reliance in recreation matters?

0 Docs your budget reflect effort to foster family solidarity
through recreation expericnccs?

Manifestly thcse yardsticks are not of such nature that
they can be used to show degrees of effectiveness, at least
in this form. Nor are they the only important qualitative
factors in budget making that reflect human values. chcr-
theless, they do suggest that mcmhcrs served and dollars
spent are by no means the most important means of evaln-
ating recreation services. 0

Recreation, park, and planning au-
thorities have been looking forward
eagerly to this publication. It is based
on a study of California conditions
conducted by a staff directed by Dr.
Josephine D. Randall, formerly super-
intendent of recreation in San Fran-
eiseo, under a representative commit-
tee, with the advice of consultants and
an advisory council of California state
and local authorities. The study was
financed by the Rosenberg Foundation
of San Francisco. The report is gener-
ously illustrated with photographs,
sketches and diagrams.

The guide presents planning prinei-
ples and the basis for determining space
standards for recreation parks in urban
population centers in the State of Cali-
fornia. The wide variations in condi-
tions found in different California mu-
nicipalities and their effect upon reere-
ation space and facility needs are em-
phasized. The State of California is di-
vided into six regions with different
characteristics, and specific recommen-
dations are made for municipalities in
each. Consideration is also given to the
' changing requirements of communities,
based upon estimates of their future
population.

A detailed and interesting forecast is
made of the major factors which will
influence planning for recreation in
California during the next twenty years.
Fourteen basic and widely applicable
principles for recreation planning are
proposed.

Definitions clarifying the terminology
used in the report are given for several
types of areas. However, the guide
deals primarily with the neighbor-
hood recreation center and the commu-
nity recreation park, which generally

and the community playfield, respec-
tively. Since these two terms have been
nationally recognized and widely ac-
cepted as referring to standard types of
recreation areas for many years, it

would have been appropriate and useful
to have given them some recognition in
the report. One might also raise a ques-
tion as to the desirability, in the guide,
of applying the term “recreation park”
to certain types of parks in view of the
fact that the essential function of all
parks is to provide recreation.

The outstanding feature of the guide
is the list of the essential functional
units to be provided in areas designed
to serve neighborhood, community and
city-wide recreation needs, their space
requirements, and the recommended
acreage for each type of area. The pro-
posed space standards are far in excess
of previous recommendations by na-
tional and local agencies, including the
National Recreation Association. The
report establishes goals which chal-
lenge recreation and planning agencies
to lift their sights.

The desirability of cooperative plan-
ning by municipal and school authori-
ties is emphasizedthroughout the guide.
Separate space standards proposed for
neighborhood and community areas
when they adjoin schools or are sepa-
rate sites vary widely, but the basis for
these variations is not indicated. Had
the report included the school site stand-
ards recommended by the California
State Department of Education and de-
scribed the features provided by school
sites, the standards for the areas adjoin-
ing schools would have much greater
significance.

Most standards for recreation space
——or for school sites—are related to the

’population to be served because the

areas are provided for people, and pre-
sumably more space is needed as the
number of persons to be served in-
creases. Thc California report, how-
ever, makes no differentiation in the

recreation space requirements of neigh-

borhoods or communities of widely dif-
ferent populations and proposes no defi-
nite relationship between needed park
acreage and a city’s population.

Only two pages are devoted to a con-
sideration of city-wide recreation areas
and facilities. They contain recommen-
dations for a service population of 100,-
000 only, but offer no suggestion as to
how these space standards should be
modified when applied to cities of dif-
ferent size. Among the city-wide fea-
tures listed is an eighteen-hole golf
course, which is the only type of area
for which a ratio to pOpulation is pro-
posed. It is doubtful, however, that
many sections of the country will ae-
eept the recommendation that a city of
100,000 should provide a square mile
developed exclusively for public golf.

Like any report which deviates from
tradition and in which general princi-
ples are implemented by detailed spe-
cific proposals, the guide is certain to be
challenged at various points.

In spite of its shortcomings, the guide
merits careful study by all who are con-
cerned with city planning and the de-
velopment of recreation and park areas.
Its analysis of conditions that have
made leisure a factor of primary im-
portance makes clear the need for addi-
tional recreation areas and facilities in
the years ahead. Every community, in
preparing plans for the extension or im-
provement of its recreation properties,
can utilize to advantage the planning
principles stated and interpreted here.
The detailed listing of individual areas
and facilities to be provided in the
neighborhood, community and city-
wide centers affords a useful checklist
for localities planning such centers; and
the diagrammatical layouts suggest a
useful method of planning a recreation
area in order to assure the effective use
of space and satisfactory relationships
between the various units.

Sineere appreciation is due the ill-
dividuals and organizations that made

possible preparation of the California
planning guide. 0

Latest Agency Information

Striking facts from 1956 Recreation and Park Year-
book*—an important feature of the National Rec-
reation Association’s Fiftieth Anniversary Year.

Federal Agencies

Federal properties set aside for rec-
reation or available for limited recrea-
tion use far exceed in area those held
by other non-federal government agen-
cies. For example, the National Park
Service administers 23,899,000 acres;
the Fish and Wildlife Service, 17,472,-
000 acres; the Forest Service 180,000,-
000 acres; the Corps of Engineers,
5,600,000 acres; and the Bureau of
Land Management, 470,000,000 acres.

Camping, picnicking, skiing, swim-
ming, hiking, riding, mountain climb-
ing, hunting, and fishing are popular
forest activities; the same activities, ex-
cept for fishing, are carried on in the
national parks, as well as various inter-
pretive programs. On the refuges, fish-
ing, hunting, picnicking, swimming,
boat-ing, photography, and wildlife ob-
servation attract the largest number of
visitors; public lands are used primar-
ily for hunting, fishing, camping. Res-
ervoir areas of the Corps of Engineers,
Reclamation Bureau and Tennessee Val-
ley Authority afford opportunity for
picnicking, camping, swimming, boat-
ing and nature activities.

Visitors to the federal areas in 1955
included more than 50,000,000 at the

areas under the National Park Service,

nearly 7,250,000 at the wildlife refuges
and fish hatcheries, more than 9,500,-

000 at the reclamation reservoir areas,
nearly 46,000,000 at the forests, 62,-

000,000 at the Corps of Engineers pro-

jects, and more than 36,000,000 at the

Tennessee Valley Authority reservoirs,
dams, and steam plants.

State Agencies

Properties owned by the states and
used for recreation are of many types:
parks, roadsides and waysides, historic
sites, monuments and memorials, res-

tional Recreation Association. "$2.00.

ervations, fish and game preserves, for-
ests, reservoirs, and recreation areas
such as beaches and camps. Roadsides
and waysides, numbering over 4,000,
are most numerous, but parks are most
widely distributed among the states.
Nearly 500,000 acres were acquired for
fish and game preserves, refuges and
sanctuaries in the five-year period end-
ing in 1955.

Attendance or visits during 1955 at
less than one-half of the areas reporting
exceeded 232,000,000, of which three
fourths were at the state parks. The
activities most frequently reported are
picnicking, fishing, camping, swim-
ming, boating, and hiking.

Many state agencies control or oper-
ate no properties but provide a variety
of recreation services; for example, in
twenty-six states the agricultural exten-
sion services conduct short courses for
training recreation leaders. In nineteen
states the education department and in
thirty-two states the state college or uni-
versity provide recreation consultation
service to localities. In forty states the
health department regulates public
swimming pools and bathing beaches.
Library agencies in thirty-four states
operate traveling libraries. Planning
departments conduct local surveys of
areas and facilities in seven states.

City and County Agencies
Of the 2,939 local, county and dis-

trict agencies providing parks or com-
munity recreation service in 1955, 923
are separate recreation authorities; 920
administer recreation in conjunction
with parks, whereas school authorities
number 343. Of the 913 authorities em-
ploying one or more persons for recrea-
tion leadership on a full-time, year-
round basis, 531 or 58 per cent are
separate recreation departments, 282
are park departments and 45 are school
authorities.

Parks and other dedicated recreation

areas, not including school sites, re-
ported by 1,907 cities and counties num-
ber 20,417 and comprise a total of
748,701 acres. Of this amount 78,820
acres or a little more than one-tenth of
the total were acquired during the five-
year period ending in 1955. Nearly
50,000 acres in school sites were also
reported usable for recreation and more
than 23,000 were actually used for com-
munity recreation in 1955.

Diversified programs under leader-
ship were conducted at 18,224 outdoor
playgrounds in 1,956 cities; nearly two-
thirds had leadership during the sum-
mer only; more than 5,000 through the
year. A total of over 13,000,000 indi-
viduals were registered at the play-
grounds in 708 cities; total 1955
attendance in 1,478 cities exceeded

420,000,000.

Paid workers in all recreation and
park positions total 142,928; of this
number 76,878 were employed for rec-
reation leadership. Workers in main-
tenance, operation and other non-lead-
ership positions, employed on a full-
time, year-round basis, outnumber the ,
recreation leaders serving on this basis
by more than four to one. Of 45,396
such workers, only 8,387 give full time
the year-round to recreation leadership.
Six out of seven park administrative
and professional workers other than
recreation leaders were employed on a
full-time, year-round basis in 1955.

Total 1955 expenditures for recrea-
tion and parks in 2,381 cities and coun-
ties exceeded $380,000,000. Of this
amount nearly $93,000,000 was spent
for land, buildings and improvements;
$62,000,000 for recreation leadership
salaries and wages. Bond issues for rec-

reation and parks voted during 1951-
55 inclusive totaled $158,755,384.

Other Yearbook figures relate to ac-
tivities, buildings and indoor centers,
indoor and outdoor recreation facili-
ties, volunteers, sources of funds, park
department organization in large cities,
lighted facilities, and attendance,among
others. For each local agency reporting,
columns are provided for recording
forty items; the Yearbook therefore af-
fords a basis for comparing the situa-
tion in the various cities as well as pre-
senting a picture of park and recreation

developments throughout the nation. 0

Students Conduct Workshop

Springfield College students con-
ducted a two-day workshop on leader-
ship and problem-solving in November,
Min A. Baillie reports in the college’s
publication, the RYL News.

The workshop was organized and led
by students in a recreation and youth
leadership course in group relations as
a field work assignment. It was carried
through without faculty instruction. A
large number of recreation majors at-
tended. Also present were physical edu-
cation and teacher education majors.

The workshop concerned itself with
club and organization problems in the
areas of motivation, leadership, com-
munication and responsibility. “One of
the most significant values of the work-
shop is the inter-club relations taking
place,” says Miss Baillie. “It was possi-
ble for the first time for oHicers of vari-
ous student organizations to exchange
views, realize similarities in their prob-
lems and attempt to work toward a com-
mon gosh—improvement.”

The workshOp used a number of
small-group discussion techniques, in-
cluding feed-back, role playing, and
film lead-offs.

A report including evaluations will
be compiled and distributed to club of-
ficers to complete the workshop’s activ-

MBA Scholarships

The Michigan Recreation Associa-
tion has awarded Henry Schubert
Scholarships to three students major-
ing in recreation at Michigan colleges.
The students are: Barbara Bestervelt
and Richard Reichel, both at Michigan
State University, and James Beers at
Eastern Michigan State College. All
plan to enter the field of community
recreation after graduation.

Great Lakes Park Institute

The eleventh annual Great Lakes
Park Institute will be held at Pokagon
State Park in Indiana February 25-
March 1. The institute is conducted
by the Indiana University Department
of Recreation in cooperation with sev-

eral other organizations. One of the

topics for 1957 will be “Leadership
Techniques.” Another will be “Tech-
niques for Getting the Best Contribu-
tions from the Staff.”

Recreation majors traditionally aid
with the Operation of the institute, pro-
viding staff services to the professional
workers attending.

Graduate Stipends Raised

Graduate recreation assistants will
receive increased stipends at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, according to Profes-
sor Charles Brightbill. Half-time as-
sistants will receive $2,100 instead of
the present $1,800. Quarter-time grad~
uate aids will receive $850, an increase
of $100. In addition, both are exempt
from payment of tuition and other
basic fees.

College Education Pays Off

Education Summary quotes Rudolph
Neuberger, president of The Tuition
Plan, as saying that a college education
is “clearly the best investment parents
can make.” Mr. Neuberger points out
that the college education pays off finan-
cially with an average in earnings of
about $100,000 more than those of a
high school graduate.

In its October 1956 report the pub-
lication revealed that 390,000 college
students—one out of six undergradu-
ates and one out of five graduate stu-

dents received federal aid in 1954. This
aid, according to National Science

Foundation figures, averaged more
than $1,000 per student.

Dr. Welborn Appointed

Dr. Gene Welborn has been appoint-
ed associate professor of recreation and
physical education at Ithaca College.
He is responsible for ,instruction in
professional courses including philoso-
phy of recreation, organization and ad-
ministration, methods and materials,
and juvenile delinquency. He also is
faculty advisor for the recreation ma-
j ors’ club and the corecreation pro-
gram.

Dr. Welborn, a University of Illinois
graduate, did his master’s work at Indi-
ana University and his doctoral work
at New York University.

New Personnel Publications

Recreation majors will want to
read carefully Personnel Stand-
ards in Community Recreation
Leadership, published recently by
the National Recreation Associa-
tlon.

This report, by the Committee
on Placement of the NRA Na-

tional Advisory Committee on
the Recruitment, Training and
Placement of Recreation Person-
nel, is the latest in a series extend-
ing back to 1931. It cites latest
recommended standards for edu-
cation and experience for recrea-
tion leadership positions. It also
suggests minimum starting sal-
aries, and lists the duties and re-
sponsibilities for a wide variety
of positions in community recre-
ation.

A basic guide to the career field,
Personnel Standards in Com-
rnunity Recreation Leadership
belongs in the personal library of
every student who plans to work
in recreation. It is a guide to the
skill and knowledge needed for
all types of jobs, and should be
helpful eSpecially to those faced
with the problem of choosing
worthwhile electives or minors.

Also new is a career mono-
graph, prepared for the Bellman
Publishing Company by W. C.
Sutherland, director of the NRA

Recreation Personnel Service. Ti-
tled Recreation Leadership, it is a
comprehensive summary of the
field and its importance, profes-
sional education, positions and.

career opportUnities, organiza-
tions employing recreation lead-
ership, and related material.

Mr. Sutherland, a graduate of
Drake University and of the Na-
tional Recreation School, writes
from the vieWpoint of an experi-
enced national consultant who
has, in twenty-thousand intcr-
views and innumerable other con-
tacts, learned the needs and de-
sires of employers, candidates,
students, and colleges. His bal-
anced presentation has special
value for the recreation major
and his advisors for this reason.

QWMZ éawaéea

Final plans for the study of recrea-
tion in hospitals—being made by the
National Recreation Association in con-
junction with the Council for the Ad-
vancement of Hospital Recreation —
were discussed at a meeting in Phila-
delphia in October.

Present were: Dr. Martin Meyer, Di-
vision of Mental Health, Indianapolis;
Dr. John Silson, medical research ex-
pert, New York City; Madolin E. Can-
non and Lillian Summers, American
National Red Cross, Washington, D.C.;
William Lawler, National Association
of Recreation Therapists; R. C. Boyd,

American Association of Health, Phy- '

sical Education and Recreation; Dr.
Gerald Fitzgerald, University of Min-
nesota; Dr. Edith Ball, New York Uni-

Percy Clapp, Veterans Administration,
Washington; D.C.; Dr. John Hineman,
,American Medical Association, Chi-

can Psychiatric Association, Washing-

, ton, D.C.

At the meeting it was brought out

MRS. HILL is the NRA consultant on
hoSpt'tal recreation.

 

Beatrice H. Hill

that the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, American Hospital Association,
and the American Medical Association
Council on Professional Practices are
interested in the study and will co-
operate.

It was decided to conduct the study
somewhat differently than previously
planned:

1. A very brief questionnaire to go
to every administrator of every hos-
pital in this country to establish ex-
actly where hospital recreation exists.

2. Upon return of these, to pick two
hundred of what appear to be the most
extensive programs and to send out a
detailed questionnaire to the adminis-
trators at these hospitals. This ques-
tionnaire to be designed to evaluate thc
place of recreation in a hospital setting.
A summary of this part of the study is
to be sent to the American Medical As-
sociation and American Hospital As-
sociation for their advice on criteria.

3. To send a detailed questionnaire
to every recreation professional work-
ing in hospitals to determine education
and experience backgrounds, job re-
sponsibilities and any other facts which
will help decide who is responsible for
hospital recreation today and what is
being done.

4. To send a questionnaire to col-
leges giving graduate and undergradu-
ate curricula in hospital recreation con-
cerning curricula subject matter. 0

Horizons For Older People *

George Gleason. The Macmillan
Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York
1]. Pp. 137. $2.95.

Among the many books on the older
adult now being published, this one has
a “switch.” Instead of writing about
what should be done, Dr. Gleason writes
primarily about what is being done.
Much of his material was gathered by
questionnaire, personal interviews, cor-
respondence and in trips across the con-
nnenL

From factual information of this
sort, the author has written a simple
easy-to-read book that includes definite
recommendations, suggestions and a
sound philosophy on the tremendous
possibilities of a program for older
adults, not only for themselves but for
the community and the nation. It should
be especially useful to church leaders
and leaders of civic or private agencies
considering such programs.

Methods and Materials in
Recreation Leadership *

Maryhelen Vannier. W. B. Saunders
Company, West Washington Square,
Philadelphia 5. Pp. 288. $4.25.

Basically, this is a source book, of
activities and their leadership, organ-
ized so that it can serve as a textbook
for college students but be equally valu-
able to recreation leaders in community
centers, churches, or other agencies. It
could also be very helpful for in-service
training programs.

The fact that it goes beyond the
game or activity book in including
theory, philosophy, and also introduces
leadership techniques with the activ-
ities, makes it more basically im-
portant. It is a very good start.
We hope Dr. Vannier will continue
writing until she can give us a book
that emphasizes and includes more in-
dividual and specific techniques of
leadership—missing in so many other-
wise fine activity books. The surface
of this field of writing in our profes-
sion has scarcely been scratched. This
book makes a beginning, although we
should have liked to have had more em-

Several interesting and useful fea-

names and addresses of periodicals in

by William Osburn, are clear and clever.
Definitely a book to be added to your

Omnibus of Fun *

Helen and Larry Eisenberg. Associ—

ation Press, 291 Broadway, New York
7. Pp. 625. $7.95.

We have come to the conclusion that
omnibus books can’t be reviewed or
judged like other books. Most recrea-
tion books are planned for a specific
audience—for beginners in a craft, or
for church leaders, or for coaches, or
drama specialists, or parents, and so
on. An omnibus has to cut across all
such lines and try to offer something for
everyone. Few people are more capable
of doing this than the Eisenbergs, but
even they can’t satisfy all of us all of
the time!

Join MARCH 0F RIMES

This book has a wealth of ideas and
suggestions for all sorts of games, par-
ties, mixers, contests, and so forth. In
the wide area of social recreation, the
Eisenbergs have had extensive experi-
ence and plenty of practice. Other sec«-
tions, such as the chapters on planning
service and money-raising projects, of-
fer very little that is new, and lean too
heavily upon church programs. The sec-
tion on hobbies and crafts is very gen-
eral, and the section on the handicapped
seems just thrown in to make sure this
group is not omitted. It is written, how-
ever, by Valerie Hunt, whose book.
Recreation for the Handicapped, is well
worth careful study.

Fortunately, these sections are a
fairly minor part of this book, and are
far outweighed by the very extensive
sections on various forms of social rec-
reation, including excellent material on
folk songs and music, as well as a pleth-
ora of games, mixers, contests, quizzes.

This omnibus will be very useful to
those many good folks who, from time
to time, have to be in charge of a social
program for their club, church or class.
It is easy to read and to understand,
and has so much breadth that its lack
of depth is not too apparent. Its faults
are mainly that it is an omnibus, and,
like all such large collections,-has to
cover too much for too many too fast.

Writing such a book must have been
a monumental task—to write one as
good as this is an achievement, and it
will give pleasure and confidence to
many of its userS.——VIRGINIA MUSSEL-

cial volleyball rules when the game is

Dramatics and Ceremonies for
Girl Scouts

Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., 155 East
4'4th Street, New York 17. Pp. 206.
Paper $1.50.

This sound, intelligent paperback
book contains a great deal of valuable
material for recreation leaders in cen-
ters, churches, on playgrounds, and
elsewhere. All of Part I, dealing with
dramatics, is well done. Much of Part
II, particularly material on flag eti-

Q'l

quette and flag ceremonies, and most of
Part IV, dealing with community
cvents, will apply to public recreation
and camp programs.

Some of the actual ceremony and
skit material, while developed specifi-
cally for Girl Scouts, can be adapted
easily for use with other groups of girls.
Activities are in good taste, of high
quality, and deserve to be put into use
by leaders of girls’ groups.

The book contains an excellent, well-
prepared and carefully selected bibliog-
raphy.

13, Wisconsin. Pp. 32. Paper $1.00,
plus postage.

This delightful pamphlet about Doro-
thy Enderis (1880-1952) is a mclnorial
to her contributions to recreation, par-
ticularly her many years as head of rcc-
reation in Milwaukee. Her last public
address was given at the National Rec-
reation Congress in New Orleans. She
said of recreation, “During working
hours a man makes a living; during his
lcisurc hours he makes a life.” She
summed up her own life with, “l ltavc
an awfully good time at my job.”

Free Diving

Dimitri Rebikofi. E. P. Dutton & Com-
pany, 300 Fourth Avenue, New York
10. Pp. 224. $5.75.

There have been so many books on
skin and scuba diving recently that we
would hesitate to review another were
it not for the fact that this latest one
(published November 1956) by a
French diving expert and free—diving
pioneer contains so much last-minute.
practical information——- with charts and
sketches of all 'up-to-date equipment,
and descriptions of all maneuvers in
handling it. There are chapters on un-

derwater adventures and their lessons,
undersea exploration, underwater tour
and hunting, photography (still and
motion picture).

Step-by-step instructions tell how to
dive with maximum efliciency and

safety, and tables tell the number of
minutes which must be allowed for de-
compression at various depths, before
returning to the surface. The few color
photographs are beautiful. The ap—
pendices list diving clubs state by state.
as well as foreign ones, and gives a di-
rectory of diving equipment dealers.
also state by state.

Why the killer came
to Powder Springs

 

HE SKINNY little Texan who drifted into

Butch Cassidy’s layout at Powder
Springs one day in ’97 had dead-level eyes,
a droopy mustache, and two six-guns tied
down for the fast draw. Called himself
Carter. Said he was a killer on the run.

That‘s why Cassidy and the outlaws in
his notorious Wild Bunch told him all about
the big future plans; for their train rohhers’
syndicate. The? took him in.

And he took them in. He was a range de-
tective whose real name was a legend in the
\Vesl—Charlie Siringo. And the information
he got helore lte quietly slipped away
stopped the Wild Buneh for a long. long
time.

Of course. Siringo knew all along that if
Cassidy or the others had discovered the
truth, they'd have killed him sure. But it
just never worried him any.

You couldn't seare Charlie Siringo. Cool-
est of cool customers and rawhide tough, he
had the go-it-alone courage it takes to build
a peaeeahle nation ottt of wild frontier. That
brand of courage is part of Anteriea and
her people—part of the country's strength.
And it’s a big reason why one of the finest
investments yott can lay hands on is Amer-
ica's Savings Bonds. Because those Bonds
are hacked hy the independence and cour-
age of 165 million Americans. So lmy U. S.
Savings Bonds. Buy thetn confidently—regu-
larly—and hold on to them!
