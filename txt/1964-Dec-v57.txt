TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR FORESTS. What you see is the raw material of one of America’s life-giving industries
Forest products and their derivatives provide income and jobs for millions of people throughout the United States.
I Yet, last year, over seven million acres of precious forest and range lands went up in flame. I Nine out of
ten forest fires are started by people . . . people who are careless. The loss is shared by all of us. I What can
you do about it? Urge your employees and the people in the communities in which you do business to be careful
with fire—every kind of fire—and to remember the basic rules: Always hold matches till cold! Be sure
you drown all fires out! Crush all smokes dead! Remember whoever you are, whatever you do . . .

America’s forests are important to you.

facilities. “New Courses for Old
Paths” explores proposals for the
use of old railroad rights-of-way

tains vital information for anyone
planning to expand his recreation
areas. An up-to-date yardstick for
measuring your own recreation
space is provided by Leslie Lynch

After the Quake
Sirs:

The Mental Hospital at Valdez, Alas-
ka, was severely damaged during the
March 27th earthquake and tidal wave.
The patients—predominantly long-term
care mentally retarded children—were
moved to temporary quarters in An-
chorage. Now reconstruction has pro-
ceeded to the point that the patients are
being returned to Valdez.

Recreation for the patients was pro-
vided largely through thte volunteer
efforts of the Tasnuna Mental Health
Association. This organization lost its
office and all supplies, including recre-
ation equipment, in the quake. The
Alaska Jaycees, from their earthquake
fund, made a small grant to replace the
office equipment but there remains a
great need for recreation equipment.
Anyone who has anything at all that
might be used is urged to send it to the
Tasnuna Mental Health Association,
Valdez, Alaska. For large items, the
Jaycees will arrange to pay shipping
costs if contacted in advance. For fur-
ther information, write to Ted Smits,

Box 1603, Anchorage, Alaska.
TED SMITS, Anchorage, Alaska.

Student Conference Plans

Sirs:

San Francisco State College, the host
school for the student sessions and ac-
tivities at the 1965 Annual California
and Pacific Southwest Recreation and
Park Conference, to be held in the Hi]-
ton Hotel in San Francisco, March 20-
24, is in full swing with its planning,
along with the assisting colleges, San
Jose State College, California State
College at Hayward, and Oakland City
College. Through their unified efforts,

- I -"

they plan to make the 1965 convention
a beneficial and rewarding experience
and yet an entertaining affair for the
students and professionals alike. At
this early date the students have already
mapped out an extensive program dur-
ing the three-day period that starts early
Sunday, March 21, and climaxes Tues-
day, March 23.

The student conference planning
committee has taken into consideration
the anticipated increase of numbers of
students attending the conference. This
is being accomplished by considering
the many needs and questions the stu-
dents might want to know in advance of
traveling to San Francisco. A packet of
all information involving students will
go to every college and university in
the state of California that offers rec-
reation as a maior. It will include such
things as hotel accommodations. res-
taurants. student activities, and things
to do while in San Francisco, plus other
interesting and vital information.

The planned student functions. con-
tests and activities consists, briefly, of
the following:

o A student name-tag contest with a
trophy being awarded to the winning
school.

o A socializing contest with a trophy
being awarded to the winning school.
0 A separate student information and
registration booth.

o On Sunday morning there will be
a meeting of the student representatives
of all schools to discuss the formation
of a state-wide student recreation or-
ganization.

0 Sunday from 11AM to 12:30PM there
will be a student get-to-gether featuring
a guest speaker, refreshments, and a
color film of San Francisco.

0 A student session entitled “The Ex-
perts, the Opportunities and You” is

scheduled from 1:30 to 3:45PM Sun-
day afternoon.
0 A steak dinner is in the making for
all students at Tad’s Steak House one
block from the hotel. The dinner will
be from 7 to 8PM Sunday and at a total
cost to the student of $1.19 complete.
0 Following the dinner the students are
moving in mass to rustle a cable car,
taking it by the top of Nob Hill to
Chinatown. From Chinatown the stu-
dents will take a short walk to San Fran-
cisco’s famous night club district——
Broadway! Arrangements are now un-
der way to make this enjoyable for both
the minors and twenty-one-year-olds.
o On Monday noon there will be a stu-
dent professional luncheon where the
students will be able to talk informally
with the professionals at a restaurant of
their choice.
0 Monday evening there will be a stu-
dent sponsored dance that will be open
to all conferencees.
o On Tuesday morning from 9 to 10AM
there will be another student session; a
title and theme has yet to be selected.
Finally, after three days at the con-
ference, the students will return to their
respective colleges and universities.

ence Coordinator, San Francisco

State College.

OCRITICAL ISSUES
In
RECREATION

Report from the 46th
National

Recrea tion, Congress

HAT ARE SOME of the issues and the critical prob-
W lems facing the recreation and park field today?

Prominent among those faced at the 46th National
Recreation Congress in Miami Beach was the growing chal-
lenge of the new leisure and the dramatically increased im-
portance of learning how it can be used constructively and
as the means of living creatively. There are real dangers of
its being squandered or destructive to American society
and desirable standards of living.

As President Johnson said, in part, in a message that
was read at the Opening session, “Recreation has a major
role to play. Only when we have learned to use our leisure
constructively in ways that refresh us and renew our ener-
gies can we build the great new society I see for America in
the future. We must move forward with strong professional
recreation leadership. We must have 000peration at fed-
eral, state, local, and private levels. So that recreation may
fully occupy this role in the future, I urge you to think and
plan in terms of an effective nationwide program.”

The Congress is cosponsored by the American Recreation
Society and the National Recreation Association, this year
with the cooperation of the Miami Beach Recreation De-
partment, the Miami Beach Park Department, the Metro-
politan Dade County Park and Recreation Department, the
Florida Recreation Association, the Orange State Recrea-
tion Association, the Florida Development Commission, and
the Federation of National Professional Organizations for
Recreation.

At the Congress opening session, Florida Governor Farris
Bryant told a packed house that, “It’s easy to lie around and
be idle, but to really live you have to work at it by doing
things, by making plans, by becoming active. Overt response

to our increasing leisure hours is necessary if we wish to
‘live all our lives’ instead of existing.” And he pointed out
that the constructive use of leisure time is not easy. A greet-
ing and welcome were extended to delegates at this meeting,
with appropriate fanfare, by the Honorable Bernard A.

Frank, vice-mayor of the city, with the help of a color guard
from the 13th Artillery Group (AD, Homestead Base).
Entertainment included lively selections by “The Singing

Mailmen”———who obviously have found ways of relishing
their leisure hours.

DAY-lN-DEPTH

At the “Day-in-Depth” session, the topic “Learning to
Live with Leisure” was discussed at length. The day-long
meeting drew practically the entire Congress attendance.
Addresses were given by leading authorities from related
fields who explored ways of solving this problem in terms
of work, religion, education, government, and the behavior-
al sciences, and concluded that each of these fields has a
responsibility related to leisure time and the direction that
society should be taking in the immediate future.

For example, Voit Gilmore, first director of the U.S.
Travel Bureau, Department of Commerce, Washington,
D.C., pointed out, that America’s problem of leisure will be
multiplied by the fact that our population of 192,000,000
will soar to 320,000,000 in another thirty-five years. “The
day has come when government bodies at all levels must be
involved in programs looking to the future of leisure liv-
ing,” he said. “Like it or not, town councils, county com-
missioners, and state legislators are already hip-deep .in
situations arising from the increasing leisure time of their
constituents. They have the responsibility of protecting
existing public areas from encroachment and the full use of
their regulatory powers to preserve open space, scenic areas,
and potential recreation land . . .”

Dr. Harry M. Philpott, vice-president of the University of
Florida, said, “An educational system attempts to train
young pe0ple for living and must also train them for leisure-
time experiences. It is also obligated to provide the training
for leaders who will make possible wholesome leisure-time
activities. To neglect these responsibilities will mean the
education~0f a generation of misfits and malcontents who
will wreck any social order. With the other social institu-
tions, our schools must provide the experience and training
which will help the American people learn to live creatively
with leisure and thus add life to their years.” While from
the point of view of religion, the Rev. Warren W. Ost of
the National Council of Churches, New York City, stated:
“The radical nature of the leisure today has forced the
church to reflect and act on her findings. Like many insti-
tutions she finds herself far behind in adjusting her think-
ing and programing. The Special forces of the churches—
both denominationally and inter-denominationally—are be-
ginning to do something about it.” '

The other distinguished panelists, R. G. McCreei'y, direc-
tor of STEP (Solutions to Employment Problems), the
National Association of Manufacturers, and Dr; Lorant
Forizs, medical director of Anclote Manor, Florida, agreed
on the importance of constructive use of leisure time as

When delegates were not finding new insights aml facts in meetings and work-
shops, examining or ordering new supplies and equipment at the extensive
exhibits, looking over the latest recreation publications, they were meeting
some of the most distinguished persons in their own field, swapping experi-

ences with their colleagues, and just plain “having fun.” Here, with pictures,

quotations, and impressions, we attempt to bring you some of the flavor and
benefits of the 46th National Recreation Congress in Miami Beach.

Twice as many wives came to the Congress
this year—some three hundred strong——
and had a gay time as this Conga line
proves. Among their more serious activi-
ties was the lancheon addressed by Eunice
Kennedy Shriver who spoke on problems
of recreation for the mentally retarded. An
unusual number of recreator husbands at-
tended this distaff luncheon meeting.

for recreation, and to Nathan L. Nlallison,
superintendent of recreation in Jackson-
ville, Florida, for his many years of serv-
ice “to the cause of better recreation for

all people.” (More on “Molly”, Pg. 510.)

achieved through creative recreation and that now leisure
will be as much a part of human behavior as work and
therefore must be made as satisfying. As Dr. Forizs re-
marked, “In recreation, man must become newly created as
well as newly creative. . . .” Said Mr. McCreery, “Increased
productivity has reduced the time spent providing the neces-
sities of life and created the opportunity for more leisure;
and the more productivity, the more Optional time. Optional
time must be at least partly invested in additional education.
Leisure means relaxation and fun but it depends on produc-
tivity for its seed and education for its shine.” In the after-
noon, delegates had the Opportunity of 'questioning these

panelists and clarifying or debating some of the material
presented in the mornincr.

EMPHASIS ON THE RETARDED

AMERICAN public recreators are lagging in their efforts to

provide recreation programs specifically geared for the
mentally retarded, according to Mrs. Eunice Kennedy
Shriver, executive vice-president of the Lt. Joseph P. Ken-
nedy, Jr. Foundation, who spoke at a luncheon session
planned for wives but attended by almost everybody. Mrs.
Shriver stated that only a small percent of the nation’s rec-
reation departments are conducting any type of recreation
program for the retarded, and that no major city has a
model year-round program for the retarded and no one has
a special budget for recreation for the retarded.

“Internships in recreation retardation are practically non-
existent,” she said. “There isn’t a single textbook in exist-
ence devoted to recreation for the retarded, and yet research
has demonstrated that retarded children, given love, super-
vised play and intellectual stimulation can actually climb
out of the retarded category and into the category of the
normal.”

She pointed out that the US. Oflice of Education estimates
eighty-three percent of the retarded are educable and can be
taught to do skillful, complex work, not just menial tasks.
She decried the lack of activities and sports specifically de-
signed for the retarded despite the fact that large grants of
money are available for the individuals to do research.

She urged cities to start year-round recreation programs
for the retardates; states to plan statewide programs to fight

 

Chairmen of the National Recreation Association’s District

mental retardation; state and iocal recreation officials to
plan special facilities for the retarded that can be financed
by the Department of Interior’s Outdoor Recreation Com-
smission; every recreation department to institute scientific
tests to measure the physical fitness of the retarded. “There
are six million mentally retarded persons in the country and
they need recreation even more than the rest of us,” she said.
This summer the Kennedy Foundation helped sponsor
twenty-two day camps for the retarded.

THE MERGER OF PROFESSIONAL PARK AND
RECREATION ORGANIZATIONS

RESULTS of the balloting on the charters, bylaws, and

amendments to the constitutions of the American Rec-
reation Society and the American Institute of Park Execu-
tives, authorizing the merger of the two organizations into
an Institute for Recreation and Parks and an American Park
and Recreation Society, were announced at the closing gen-
eral session of the Congress as follows:

Total voting __..__._._-_m.________ _______ .. 1,171

At its meeting in Miami Beach, the American Recreation
Society Administrative Council adopted the following reso-
lutions:

“The American Recreation Society Executive Board in-
itiates action to bring together board representatives of
interested organizations to develop a statement of philoso-
phy, principles, and policies related to merger, federation
and/ or other relationships among those organizations in
the field of recreation and parks.

“The past presidents of the American Recreation Society
historically and deeply concerned with the need for unity of
professional grOUps in recreation sent this Resolution to our
New Administrative Council:

“ ‘That in the light of the overwhelming vote for merger
with American Institute of Park Executives we urge this
procedure to continue as rapidly as possible toward fulfill-
ment and if the present status is confirmed by American
Institute of Parks Executives, that we then continue to nego-
tiate jointly with NRA to be officially the service organiza-
tion for the new professional group and that the service of
the three groups move forward in advancing the recreation
movement in greater unity and with renewed interest and
dedication.’ ”

At the meeting of the NRA Board of Trustees at Miami
Beach the following resolution was ad0pted:

“WHEREAS the American Recreation Society passed a res-
olution to bring together board representatives of interested
organizations to deveIOp a statement of philosophy, prin-
ciples and policies related to merger, federation and/ or
other relationships among those organizations in the field of

SUCCESSFUL BOND ISSUES

OTERS of three stateswCalifornia,

Rhode Island and WashingtOn—
approved outdoor recreation bond
issues at the November 3rd elections. In
California, a $150,000,000 bond issue,
the largest state outdoor recreation
bonding measure yet proposed, was ap-
proved by a margin of three to two.
Rhode Island’s $5,000,000 “Green
Acres” bond issue carried two to one.
Washington voters approved a $10.-
000,000 bond issue seven to five. A
second Washington ballot proposal to
earmark $1,500,000 in state motorboat
fuel taxes for shoreline acquisition and
development and to better organize the
state government to meet outdoor rec-
reation needs also was approved five to
three. Details of the three state bond

issues:

California. The $150,000,000 will be
used to acquire additional state parks
and beaches ($85,000,000), for mini-
mum development of these new state
areas ($20,000,000), for new hunting
and fishing areas and public access
rights ($5,000,000), and for state in-

centive grants to cities and counties

($40,000,000) .

Rhode Island. The “Green Acres”
bonds will help finance a comprehen-
sive program of planning. acquisition,
and development of shoreline parks and
other types of outdoor recreation areas
and to buy scenic easements. A third
of the money will be shared with local
governments on a matching basis.

Washington. The bond issue will help
buy and develop additional state parks
and other types of recreation areas.
The second Washington measure, to
earmark motorboat fuel taxes for out-

door recreation rather than for high- .

way development and to set up a focal
point within the state government to
coordinate outdoor recreation plan-
ning, was placed on the ballot by peti-
tion through the initiative process after
the Legislature failed to act.

Other bond issues or fund bills passed
recently:
0 A bill passed by the Delaware State
Legislature in October authorizing up
to $3,250,000 from the revenue of the
DuPont-General Motors divestiture to
be used for the purchase of public park
and recreation land and conservation
of wildlife areas. Funds will be made
available to all levels of government.

0 Santa Clara County, California, ap-
proved $21,918,000 in park and build-

ing bonds, of which $6,750,000 is for
park and land development.

0 Rye, New York, voted $2,200,000 to
improve recreation facilities in a spe-
cial bond issue referendum. Of this,
$1,600,000 is for the purchase of the

recruiting for three new top-level jobs.
These include director of the NRA’s
new National Training Service, a
county recreation and parks consultant

 

HERBERT HOOVER

AMONG THE MILLIONS who
mourned the death of former
President Herbert Hoover, few did
so more sincerely than thousands of
boys in more than 450 communities
throughout the country. This is a
rather special group of boys, once
described by Mr. Hoover as “our
nation’s most precious natural- re-
source.” To these boys, Mr. Hoover
was more than a former president,
more than one of history’s great
humanitarians, more that a great
statesman or a great patriot. To them
and to millions like them now grown
to manhood, Mr. Hoover was a friend
interested in helping them.

When it was decided to build a
Herbert Hoover Building in New
York City as headquarters for the
Boys’ Clubs of America, these boys
decided to “help Mr. Hoover,” who
was chairman of the board. In scores
of ingenious ways, they raised funds
for “Mr. Hoover’s building,” along
with the hundreds of civic, social,
government, industrial and labor
leaders Mr. Hoover enlisted to help
him work with his “pavement boys.”

) BRIEFING. Before returning to their
regional headquarters after the Na-
tional Recreation Congress in Miami
Beach, the district representatives of
the National Recreation Association
spent three days in Washington, D.C. in
a series of conferences with federal
agencies concerned with recreation.
After thorough briefings by govern-
ment officials on their programs and
plans, the implications of these pro-
grams at the community level were dis-
cussed and cooperative relationships
between the NRA and the federal agen-
cies were explored. Conferences were
held with the Bureau of Outdoor Rec-
reation, Bureau of Reclamation, the
Department of Agriculture including
several of its divisions, Corps of En-

gineers, and the Ofiice of Economic
Opportunity.

) ON THE (:0: National Recreation As-
sociation staff members have been
guest speakers at a number of recent
state park and recreation conferences.
Executive Director Joseph Prendergast
spoke at the Wisconsin Recreation As-
sociation conference in Milwaukee on
November 5 and at the Missouri Park
and Recreation Association conference
in Springfield on November 13. Re-
search Director Betty van der Smissen

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

) LEISURE Is A POLITICAL DANGER, ac-
cording tO a note in the September 1964
issue of Recreation Management, pub-
lication Of the National Industrial Rec-
reation Association. “The view that
increasing leisure time is a blessing for
the workers Of America is not univer-
sally shared by all who study major
social trends,” says the publication.
“Dr. James C. Charlesworth believes
that the increase in leisure time for
Americans will inevitably only increase
the number Of professional spectators,
hundreds upon hundreds who sit and
watch a few professional athletes per-
form. Charlesworth, who is president
of the American Academy Of Political
Science, believes that the result Of more
leisure is a threat to democracy for, as
he puts it, ‘If people are trained to sit
and watch professionals in sport and
other leisure activities, they will also
sit and watch some busybodies take
their government away.’ Charlesworth
claims that mass sport spectacles in

Central EurOpe are related to recurring
dictatorships there.”

> A NEW MONTHLY PUBLICATION, the
pocketsize Camp Directors’ Digest, has
just been launched by the Camp Re-
search Foundation which was organized
in 1962. The first issue of the Digest,
published in October, can be obtained

) THE ONLY WORTHWHILE achievement
of their twentieth century ancestors in
the eyes Of our great-grandchildren may
be the conversion Of raw physical en-
ergy into useful power, according to
Dr. Lewis T. Benezet, president Of the
Claremont Graduate School and Uni-
versity Center, who delivered the key-
note address at the opening session Of a
Columbia University educational sem-
inar in Harriman, New York, in Octo-
her. Said Dr. Benezet, “Men Of the
future will judge that art, music, litera-
ture, and architecture Of this century
barely caught up with that of previous
centuries.” He deplored a future situa-
tion in which all work needed for sur-
vival might be accomplished by an elite
cadre comprising only two percent Of
the population, “with no provisions for
the building of mechanisms for the pres-
ervation of human options and human
individuality.” He stressed that, “If
human individuality will not be pre-
served accidentally, it must be preserved
ingeniously, deliberately, tenaciously,
and even prayerfully.”

} TWO NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WORK-
ING TOGETHER on a liaison committee at
the national level—the National Recre-
ation Association and Amateur Athletic
Union—are seeking to improve their
Operations at the local level in order to

get the most out Of both programs. The
recreation departments have facilities,
some more extensive than others, but
facilities that can be utilized. The AAU
has volunteer workers in all phases of
physical fitness and competitive sports.

The many parks and recreation de-
partments throughout the country Offer
a tremendous opportunity for an ex-
panding, cooperative program of ath-
letics and physical fitness for young
peOple. An example is the very success-
ful September 12th AAU Junior Olym-
pic Sports Festival conducted by the
Recreation Division Of the Department
of Parks in New York City.

physical fitness, increase our competi-
tive athletic programs and produce na-
tional and international champions”!

ous state in the Union. However, figures

Leisure—Boon or Threat?

WE CAN PLAN our communities
so that the natural beauties Of
the landscape and waterscape are not
only left undestroyed but enhanced.
The architecture of the large cities
must be improved so that there is
enjoyment to contemplating the city-
scape. We need wide avenues, a mul-
titude of open spaces such as plazas,
parks, squares, buildings which com-
plement each other, neighborhoods
which in their diverse ways cater tO
a full life for all their inhabitants,
young and old, whatever their in-
come level. . . . We must learn to use
our leisure so that the reduction Of
the work schedule is looked On as a
boon rather than a threat. The vari-
ety of recreational and cultural pur-

suits must be as large and as accessi-
ble as possible. Technological inno-
vations should be sought tO make this
variety possible. If there is good
reason for dissatisfaction in being
treated as an interchangeable part in
a mass audience now, how much
worse it will become when the pOpu-
latiOn doubles. We should seek to
create a diversity of large and small
audiences, to increase the multiplic-
ity of participating groups, and
should develop the means which
makes this not only possible but eco-
nomically desirable. -—- VICE-PRESI-

RECREATION

 

James C. Dittmar

N A PLEASANT afternoon recently,
0 ten-year-old Nancy Otis of Ab-

ington, Pennsylvania, went for
a ride on her new bicycle. It wasn’t just
an ordinary ride, though, for Nancy
and the hundreds of cyclists who fol-
lowed her, for they were taking the first
ride on the Bike Pike, newest addition
to Alverthorpe Park, Abington Town-
ship’s celebrated recreation area.

The three-mile-long paved bicycle
trail was given to the park by Lessing J.
Rosenwald in honor of his wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Rosenwald originally pre-
sented fifty-four acres of their estate,
Alverthorpe, to Abington Township for
the development of the park. Following
the development of this initial tract,
they gave Abington sixty-two adjoining
acres last fall in observance of their
fiftieth wedding anniversary. Bike Pike

MR. DITTMAR is superintendent of parks
and recreation in Abington Township,
Pennsylvania.

Bike PIKE

 

 

was designed and constructed under the
direction of Ellwood Allen, professional
recreation consultant of Bennington,
Vermont.

Bike Pike circles most of Alverthorpe
Park’s expanded perimeter. The ma-
cadam trail begins at an attractive
stone-and-wood, California-style build-
ing where a hundred of the park’s bi-
cycles can be stored. The building and
bicycles, as well as the trail, were also
gifts from Mr. Rosenwald. These park
bikes, available in varied sizes and
styles including tandems, can be rented
by children and adults. There is no
charge on Bike Pike for those who use
their own bicycles.

Peddling away from the bike build-
ing, the cyclist skirts a picnic grove,
then softball fields and suddenly plunges
into deep woods. Here he seems in an-
other world as he coasts down the steep
and winding trail guarded by hundreds
of centuries-old trees, the cool quiet

broken only by the whiz of tires on the
path. A small creek is crossed and then
he pumps up the other side of the valley
emerging from the woods to pass the
park’s golf course, kiddies’ play area
and tennis and basketball courts. The
path then returns to the bike house.
Since receiving the initial grant of
land from the Rosenwalds in 1961, the
Board of Commissioners of Abington
Township have invested $333,000 in the
development of Alverthorpe Park. Ap-
proximately 370,000 has been allocated
for the development later this year of
an artificial lake which will be used for
boating, fishing, and ice skating and for
adjacent parking and overnight camp-
ing areas. Alverthorpe Park has been
heavily used by the citizens of Abington

The NRA Board of Trustees also authorized and directed
the board chairman to offer the following recommendations
for consideration:

1. That the National Conference on State Parks be in-
cluded in further discussions at the Board level;

2. That an advisory group of outstanding recreation and
park executives be appointed to advise the joint Boards
on further deliberations, and

3. That a reasonable time limit be established for seeking
agreement between the joint Boards regarding philosophy,
principles and policies relating to merger, federation and/

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN a flying skier? If not, you should

have been present one night in Miami. Beautiful, il-
luminated by night lights shining over green water, water
skiers of all ages———-from seven years to grandmother’s age-—
performed fantastically difficult feats before the crowded
Miami Marine Stadium, in an extravaganza planned espe-
cially for Congress delegates. This was the well-named
“Miami Spectacular.” In an unexpected high wind, the ski-
ers put on a performance planned for calmer waters. As
one of the closing numbers, several of them in glittering
costume, attached themselves to giant kites and, taking off
into the air, reached breath-taking heights. As they circled
and came in toward the grandstand they looked like great
graceful birds of tropical colors. The entire evening was a

rare treat, and our sincere thanks to planners and per-
formers!

o SPOTLIGHT 0N EXHIBITS: More than a hundred different
exhibits were displayed, revealing new trends in recreation
in many instances. Located just off the main lobby of the
Deauville Hotel, the exhibit area was ofiicially opened by
Max Carey, one of baseball’s all-time greats and a member
of baseball’s Hall of Fame.

Much of the play equipment was modeled after various

types of naval vessels, Cinderella’s pumpkin carriage, rocket
ships and other space vehicles, and storybook characters.
Some playgrounds are now planned in units, or around a
central theme. Sports equipment included new ball-throw-
ing machines, rebound nets, and tennis pitching apparatus.
One of the exhibitors displayed rubber playground cushion-
ing material designed to eliminate serious injury from falls.
This product is claimed to last fifteen years in all climates.
o J OTTINCS BY AN NRA DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE: “I jotted
down the following notes as we observed swimming pools,
playgrounds, parks, marinas, inland waterways, beaches
and interpretive nature trails (jungle trails) : Methods used
in park maintenance are changing so rapidly a continual
in-service training for personnel is necessary . . .
Planning continues to be all important; more problems can
be solved or mistakes made in the planning stage than at
any other time . . . Test new materials and, when an item
has been determined as adequate for the needs, instruct per-
sonnel in how to use it properly . . . Glidden Paint Company
now manufactures an athletic field marking paint which
is proving more satisfactory than lime, rock dust or tapes,
practical on all surfaces including turf . . . A material called
Plastoloid is working out well to seal and preserve surfaces of
picnic table and signs . . . Steel charcoal grills more prac-
tical than cast iron because they can be more easily repair-
ed . . . Maintenance equipment such as mowers and rollers
can be more easily loaded and unloaded from low-bed trail-
ers (on small wheels) . . . Parks adjacent to school buildings
make cooperative use of facilities possible . . .Games
courts are best on hard-surface areas—where they must
be on turf they should be mowed regularly . . . If consider-
ing using weed killers, seek expert advice, otherwise you
may ruin turf—-—or trees if material reaches root systems . . .
Don’t throw away small amounts of cement left over from
construction jobs, pour it into forms for automobile
bumper blocks.

“I saw good ideas for sharpening reel-type mower blades
and for making heavy ground rollers highly portable . . .
Park men in large cities will want to watch for a piece of
equipment now being tested—the Incin-O-Mobile, a trailer
unit for safe on-the-spot collecting and burning of trash.
All trash, leaves, et cetera dumped into trailer are immedi-
ately burned. It is smokeless, odorless, sparkless, and elim-
inates need for large land area for dumping and the fre-

RECREATION

There is a hash that comes on Christmas Eve—
Life’s hurry and its stress grow far away;
CA . And something in the silence seems to weave
PM  A mood akin to sadness, yet we say
A “Merry Christmas” to the friends we meet,
And all the while we feel that mystic spell,

09 As if the Christ Child came on noiseless feet,
With something old, yet ever new, to tell—
cl. . The eyes grow misty, yet they shed no tear,
e ltd flan And those that we have lost, somehow seem near.

with an ice carnival and winter games

Winter carnivals, always popular,
continue to get bigger, better, and
brighter. They are featuring an ever-
widening variety of events and extend-
ing over a longer period. In Rochester,
New Hampshire, the winter carnival is
now a ten-day project, sponsored by
three service clubs, a ski club, and the
recreation department. The following
instructions for snow sculpture, always
an integral part of a winter carnival,
were taken from one of the excellent
mimeographed guides prepared for its

 

498

staff by the Recreation Division of the
Welfare Department in Kansas City,
Missouri.

ONE METHOD of snow modeling is to
pack snow into a large pile, spray
with water, and let it freeze. When
frozen, this block of snow can be carved
and chipped into figures with a hatchet.
The evident weakness of this method is
the problem of weight distribution.
Since the statue must support its own

WET CLOW/‘WOZCW FDR
MA 057?}? m5

weight, the variety of subjects which
can be modeled in this way is limited.

A second method employs slush—
made by filling a pail of water with
snow or pouring water over snow—and
a framework of board and wire. Since
the snow artist shapes the form on a
frame, this method is similar to that of
the clay sculptor. Slush is similar to
plaster or clay in its pliability and slush
can be chipped, carved, and smoothed
even after it is frozen.

The sculptor first choses his subject.
It would be wise for the beginners to
model something that requires simple
framework. Figures which can be erect-
ed around sturdy supports are the most
practical. Next, the sculptor draws a
picture of the proposed statue. He may
want to reproduce it in clay. The statue
is built from the drawing or the clay
model in proportionate size. An accur-
ate scale model is particularly necessary
if the subject is difficult because the
sculptor will be working with snow and
he must avoid needless mistakes during
actual construction. On the matter of
size, experienced snow artists suggest
that it is easier to construct a life-size
model than a smaller one.

The next step is the selection of tools.
The sculptor must have the following
things: wood, wire, a large bucket,
sprinkling can or a hose, dipper to apply
slush, shovel to build the platform, a
paddle, trowel, knife, hatchet, and wood
rasp (for producing hair effects) to
shape the model. If he wants to give
color to his work of art, he will also
need Kalsomine paint and a two-inch
brush or larger to apply it.

The first step in the actual modeling
is making a bank of snow two or three

RECREATION

feet high. The model is erected upon
this platform. The place where this
platform is built is of great importance.
If possible, the statue should be dis-
played against a dark surface or build-
ing so it will show up to greater advan-
tage.

The boards chosen for the legs should
be cut a foot longer than the actual leg
measurements so they can be sunk into
the base as extra supports. The sculptor
piles slush or snow about the leg boards
and then pours water over the entire
structure so it will freeze and become
solid.

A large box can be placed in the
center of the body of the figures as part
of the armature. This will lessen the
weight of the finished model and will
decrease the possibility of its toppling
over. The rest of the framework is erect-
ed and wired or nailed together.

Now the actual modeling can begin.
The constructor applies the slush to
the armature building, shaping with a
paddle or trowel as he goes. Even after
the slush has frozen he can change the
figure by chipping and carving with a
hatchet. He will be able to experiment,
for if the weather stays cold he can
continue remodeling over a period of
several days.

The modeler now reviews the statue
from all sides to check on the propor-
tions. When the statue is satisfactory,
he can color it by applying Kalsomine
in a pasty consistency. The- water
freezes leaving the color. After the fin-
ished statue is sprayed with water it
looks like an ice carving and it will be
less likely to melt.

If the artist wants to display his
statue at night, a small spotlight on the
statue makes an effective display. Care
must be taken in placing the lights to
achieve the best possible effect. The
placement depends on the size and
shape of the model. The strength of the

light is determined by the size of the
model.

SNOW GAMES
CHILDREN AND SNOW have a natural

aliinity. Make a virtue out of
necessity and add snow games and
sports to your program. The examples
that follow are included in a winter

sports manual prepared by the Recrea-
tion Division of the Welfare Depart-
ment in Kansas City, Missouri.

DECEMBER, 1964.

RED LION. Any number can play this
game. It can be combined with hide-
and-seek or as a game of tag. A den
where the lions stay is marked off on
the ice or snow. In the den are a Caller
and a Red Lion. The Caller sends the
Red Lion out after other lions which he
brings back after tagging them. When
the number outside the den is reduced,
the Caller may order lions to go out in
couples or quarters and they must hold
hands when chasing other lions. The
game continues until all of the players
are caught. There are variations of the
Red Lion game which will be easily
contrived.

SNOWBALL THROW. Mark a three-

foot target on the side of a building.
Each contestant is given ten throws,
each one turn, from a throwing line
sixty feet distant. One point is scored
each time the target is hit. This is a
favorite of boys for informal play.

PELTING THE PIPE. Make a large

snowman and put a pipe in his mouth.
Make a pelting line twenty feet on each
side of the snowman and station one
team behind each line. Allow a few
minutes for the teams to make a large
supply of snowballs. On signal, the
players attempt to knock the pipe out
of the snowman’s mouth. The team that
first knocks the pipe out wins.

SN OWBALL TWENTY-ONE. Make

a large snowman with arms outstretched
holding a barrel hoop parallel to the
ground. The players line up about
twenty feet distant and attempt to toss
snowballs through the hoop. Each goal
scores one point and the players win

that scores twenty-one (or eleven)
points first.

SNOWBALL ROLLING CONTEST.

Each contestant prepares a snowball
one foot in diameter before the contest
starts. On signal each rolls his ball for
five minutes, when the stopping signal
is given and all balls must remain at
the spot until measured. The balls are
measured the greatest diameter and the
largest wins. These balls can be used
to build a snow man.

New center’s gameroom offers activities for all age groups. OW ENOUGH radishes and you may

reap a new community house!

That’s what the citizens of Bran-
ford, Connecticut, will tell you! The
need was obvious. Branford is a town
bursting at the seams with a population
that has increased by fifty percent since
1950. The old community house had
become a shoddy eyesore at a busy in-
tersection. The town’s senior citizens
were playing cribbage in a drafty loft
over the community house gym. Grow-
ing demand for the use of the senior
high-school auditorium was proof
enough that the town needed another
facility.

It took the local women’s club to
launch the project but the youngsters
of the town really sent it into orbit. To
date, they have engaged in over eight
hundred money-raising activities. Take
young Peter Sokolosky, who raised
radishes and sold them at a gigantic
Community House Fair that involved
some thirty-two organizations and
netted some $3,000 for the facility.
Other donations came from alumni
basketball games, the sale of worms,
bottle drives, fruit-cake sales, penny
dances, card parties, sales of second-
hand comic books, a backyard circus,

sales of potholders, gifts of stocks and
The lounge was completely furnished by local women’s club. bonds, a donation from an impressed

 

Canadian visitor, house and garden
tours, and innumerable dances and
service projects. Virtually every or-
ganization, business, adult, and child
in the Branford area has contributed
dollars and cents, time and labor, or
both to the building of the new com-
munity house.

Branford’s recreation program has
been a community effort since its start.
The Branford Community Council, or-

MR. TREPASSO is director of recreation
in Branford, Connecticut.

Determined citizens raise funds for the building with “strongest foundation in town”

ganized October 13, 1920, was a group
of public-spirited citizens who inter-
ested themselves in three phases of
community life: “Cooperation with the
Home,” teaching cooking and sewing;
“Cooperation with the Schools,” a kin-
dergarten; and “Recreation,” erection
of a playground and a bandstand. In
1921 the council leased the Harrison
house as headquarters for the Visiting
Nurse Association, the Gaylord Health
Association, and a kindergarten. The
“Recreation Committee” was granted

one evening a week “for games.”
A BUILDING on the corner of South
Main and Montowese Streets be-
came Branford’s lirst recreation cen-
ter in 1928. First an armory, then the
Pythian Hall, then the local home of
the I. Newman Corset Company, it was
bought by the Hammer family and
turned over to the Community Council.
The drive for a new community house
started in 1958 when the Branford
Women’s Club realized the time had
come for a new facility that would really
be a center of all community interests,
a building with proper facilities for an
expanded adult recreation program, as
well as a place where young people
could meet for craft classes, dance les-
sons, and many sports activities. Such
a building would also furnish a suitable
place for the Red Cross Bloodmobile to
operate efficiently, a place where civic

organizations and groups could meet,
and a room designed to accommodate

the
citizen group.

On December 13, 1960 the town
voted to Hoat a $370,000 bond issue for

the project. This vote was unani-
mously approved at the Representative

Town Meeting. To date, some $125,000

has been raised through private means,

town’s ever-increasing senior-

DECEMBER, 1964

including donated labor. Some $40,000

worth of equipment has been secured
through donations and work projects.

HE NEW BUILDING, dedicated last

year, has twenty-two thousand
square feet and is located on Hammer
field, a thirteen-acre tract given to the
town by the Hammer family for recrea-
tion purposes. The exterior is brick
and glass, and a large terrace at the
front is made of Stony Creek granite
and brick. There is a large overhang
and great expanses of glass are used in
all the large rooms.

The interior of the building is mostly
concrete masonry block of all kinds,
including spectra glaze, a washable ma-
terial used in lockerrooms. These
materials, along with the tile Hoors and
acoustical ceilings, were used to keep
down maintenance.

0n the upper level is a 64’-by-42’
all-purpose room with Special maple
flooring for dancing, roller-skating,
banquets, and parties. Adjacent to the
all-purpose room is a 22’ -by-19' kitchen.
About 350 diners can be served here
and there is a storage room off this area
for tables and chairs. There are also
recessed dimmer lights and a built-in
record player.

A brick and stone planter in the lobby
was contributed by a local resident and
equipment for the offices off the lobby

was donated by the First Congrega-

tional Church. To the left of the lobby is
a 44’-by-20’ lounge furnished by the
Branford Women’s Club. The 20’-by-
12' conference room was furnished
by Score, a teenagers’ boating group
from Stony Creek. A 42’-by-26' game-
room offers pool, Ping-pong, checkers,
and chess.

On the lower level is the golden-age
room, a 32'-by-19’ area located for

maximum sunlight and planned for
easy access—no stairs. Activity rooms
on this level are used for classes in
boating, dancing, and flower arrange-
ment. The 90’-by-72’ gym [The Joe
Trepasso Gym] has a main basketball
court and two smaller courts, four bad-
minton courts, and two volleyball

Baskets can be raised and

the gym for separate activities for boys
and girls. The gym is used extensively
in the morning by women for volley-
ball, basketball, and golf classes.

Another activity room includes a

in cake decorating, art, sewing, and
home making. It is used also for movies
and shuffieboard, and a lounge area has
an improvised cafeteria. An exercise
room, 24’-by-13’, has rowing and bi-
cycle machines, weights, and other
equipment. Music lessons are given in
another special room.

Hunting Litterbugs

TWO STATES are now using aircraft
to spot litterbugs. In New Jersey,
helicopters patrol Off-shore waters. They
warn waterborne litterbugs through
loudspeakers and, when things get out
of hand, radio patrol launches move in
for arrests.

Loudspeaker-equipped airplanes, pro-
vided by the Wisconsin Conservation
Department, have been used for the past
three years in a concerted anti-litter
program along the 284-mile river reach-
es of the Upper Mississippi River Wild-
life and Fish Refuge. The planes warn
litterbugs and coordinate activities Of
ground and waterborne patrols.

Rural Seminar

( ; UIDELINES and action programs for
rural recreation were established

at the Third National Rural Family

Recreation Seminar held this summer
at the Thor Center for Better Farm Liv-
ing in Huntley, Illinois. The guidelines,
which will be published in detail in a re-
port tO be issued nationally later this
year, included calls for increased atten-
tion to recreation by all levels of gov-
ernment, an accelerated program of
recreation teacher training and recogni-
tion Of a new modern family in rural
America. Nearly a hundred delegates,
representing the nation’s leading recre-
ation organizations, colleges and uni-
versities, and government and private
agencies, met with the theme of “Im-
plementing Recreation for Better Rural
Living.”

The three-day seminar featured rec-
reation demonstrations and exhibits.
Highlights of the demonstrations were

Fit After Forty?

DO YOU THINK the “noble savage” is

the physical superior of the “deca-
dent” city dweller? Popular belief says
yes, but a current scientific study by
University of California in Los Angeles
gives the edge to the city slicker—until
he hits middle age. The study is part
of a continuing international effort to
gather physical performance data on
groups living in isolated areas.

Dr. Gerald Gardner of the UCLA de-

partment of physical education observes
that though young males in industrial-
ized societies tend to be more physically
fit than their less civilized peers, their
physical performance capacity tends to
decline at a much faster rate and to a
greater degree during middle and old
age.

Why this middle-age slump? Dr.
Gardner and his assOciates, who re-
cently returned from a study-trip among
the Navajos of northeast Arizona, be-
lieve that the answer lies principally in
the attitude of our society toward physi-
cal work and exercise. “We tend to have
set ideas as to the amount and type of
physical work it is proper for a man of
a certain age to do,” he says. “We set
arbitrary cut-off points, say age forty,
when a man should ‘slow-down.’ ”

And concerning consistent, daily ex-
ercise, he observes that though we ap-
prove of a college boy running laps, we
grow alarmed when his forty-Iive-year-
old neighbor continues to do it.

“We label him a ‘health nut’ and
would much prefer that he confine him-
self to ‘approved’ channels, such as
golf,” the UCLA researcher says.

Wedding March

A LOCAL Baltimore merchant donated

about eight hundred wedding and
bridesmaid gowns to the Bureau of Rec-
reation in October, 1963. These were
distributed among fifty-three recreation
centers throughout the city. Many mem-
bers of the bureau’s Mothers Club,
Golden Age Groups, and other volun-
teers immediately busied themselves
washing, cleaning, and altering the

gowns for many uses. Some were used |

Here’s a Tale

BATTLE JOINED cities throughout the
United States this season in reviv-

ing storytelling, the oldest cultural arts
form, as a “new” fall-winter youth

activity. Climaxing a month of story-
telling instructions at four of the cen-

ters, the city’s Recreation Division
sponsored a city-wide storytelling com-
petition, patterned after similar events
held annually in ancient Ireland. Dur-
ing the competition youngsters related
stories in fable, folklore, poetry, tall
tale, myth, and legend categories. Seat-

Patrick Heneghan June Justice

,.

AS THE STAFF of the recreation de-
partment in Hollywood, Florida,
approached the production of the
fourth annual Seven Lively Arts Festi-
val this year, we realized how very
much we had gained from the stand-
point of experience in the field of poetry
and its place in recreationf When it was
decided four years ago to add the festi-
val to the recreation program, we were
naturally familiar with the staging of
the lively arts ’of dancing, drama, music
and singinggibut what could be done
with poetry on a very large amphi-
theater stage? How could poetry be
made visual, attractive, and entertain-
ing to a large audience of adults as well
as children?

We have found that, far from being
an “also ran” of the week’s activities,
the Poetry Night has become one of the
most outstanding and popular pro-
grams, attracting wide and enthusiastic
interest, appealing to children, teen-
agers, and adults alike. June Justice,
who has worked closely with the recrea-
tion department on many occasions,
was invited to be chairman of Poetry
Night. A former professional actress,
writer, director, and teacher, Miss

Justice now has a Studio of Speech and
Drama and Children’s Theatre in H01-

lywood. Her personal step-by-step ap-
proach in developing the poetry pro-
gram follows.-—PATRICK J. HENEGHAN,

Director of Recreation, Hollywood,
Florida.

WHEN YOU EMBARK on an unchart-
ered adventure such as staging a
“Poetry Night,” one of the most help-
ful elements is to have a wide-awake,
enthusiastic recreation department with
a cooperative and talented staff to bol-
ster your courage and help you to over-
come each obstacle and decision as it

_ grises. Although Mr. Heneghan gave

T'me free reign, I was in a quandary as
to how to build a “Poetry Night” for
performance on a huge stage before a
large audience, one that would provide
appeal, variety, and quality sufficient to
hold its own with the other lively arts.
Many people shy away from what they
think poetry is and we had to break
down this resistance. A search for sug-
gestions or outlines of similar pro-
grams proved fruitless. No known
source provided such information, so
it became more apparent that we would
have to pioneer.

Several points were clear from' the
first. Poetry must be made the leading
lady of the evening. We wished to lean
as little as possible on other arts, while
employing them subtly to bring poetry
to life. We wanted to create an evening
emphasizing the music of poetry—the
rhythm of the spoken words alone re-
vealing the beauty of the poet’s idea—
and showing the rhythmic cadcnces of
words as they were danced to, and in-

terpreted by, the grace of the human
body.

For the first festival we all had a feel-
ing of trial flight. So for the first Poetry
Night we chose as our theme “The
Winged Horse.” With the muse of
poetry flying over Hollywood, Florida,
so to speak, we began assembling per-
formers, numbers, and making poetry
selections. The program opened with
“The Star Spangled Banner” spoken
by all the choric-Speaking groups as-
sembled on the stage at once. Separated
from music, the historic words rang out
clear and bright with new meaning.
This has become a feature of each suc-
ceeding program.

The relation of movement, color,
vitality and meaning of poetry was ex-
citingly illustrated by the dancing,
acrobatic and rhythmic groups from
Colbert Elementary School. Marseline
West, the principal, and her faculty,
grasping our ideas readily, developed a
presentation of “The Nutcracker Suite,”
which illustrated the very qualities we
desired and created a tremendous hit
with the audience.

To BRING as many children into the
program as possible, we used
choric-speaking groups, who presented
poems in unison, ranging from proud
little kinderga rtencrs p e r f o rm i n g
Mother Goose rhymes to high-school
groups presenting Edna St. Vincent
Millay’s “Afternoon on a Hill.” The
Barry College speech major class, di-
rected by Sister Marie Carol, performed
Robert Browning’s “The Pied Piper of

A hit in Hollywood, Florida, annual

Poetry Night attracts enthusiastic participants

—from poets to postmen and popcorn vendors

Hamelin” in costume for an enthusi-
astic response.
Professional dancers Barbara Bernt-

son and Revell Shaw interpreted the
poems “To a Skylark” and “Ode to the
West Wind” in beautiful rhythmic

movement. Dancing to poetry which
had only the human voice for music
proved a totally new experience for
most of our audience and opened a new
area of appreciation.

Desiring the experience of listening
to the music of sound and words in their
purity, we arranged to have poems
spoken in several foreign languages.
Thus was born the Poetry Round Table.
Around a large table in the center of
the stage we assembled a group of
people with linguistic ability. The re-
sult was an exciting half hour of poems
spoken in Hebrew, Greek, East Indian,
French, German, Italian, Spanish, and
in Irish, Cockney and Scottish dialects.
Here, the ear could be thrilled with
the rhythm and cadences of sound,
even if the words might not be clear.

The evening closed with Lincoln’s
Gettysburg Address spoken in stirring
but simple style by Frank Bowers, the
original “Dr. I.Q.” now retired. Only
at the very finish did we have a musical
background for this majestic prose
poem.

F OR THE SECOND festival Poetry Night
we chose as a theme, “I Hear
America Singing,” in keeping with the
request of President John F. Kennedy
for more demonstration of patriotism,

DECEMBER, 1964

and we used all the Americana possible.

At this time the first Poetry Contest
sprang into being. This idea came from
the desire to stimulate and to keep alive
and vital the personal experience of
poetry for everyone—to have people
not only like to hear poetry but arouse
a desire to write it. The schools and
newspapers cooperated, and soon origi-
nal poems began rolling in. Three cate-
gories were formed for children, inter-
mediates, and adults. To stimulate more
enthusiasm, three prizes were awarded
plus several honorable mentions in each
category. English classes in the high
and elementary schools were pleased to
have recognition of their work, as all
poems were carefully screened by repu-
table judges: The presentation of the
awards has become an exciting high-
light of each program.

For the third Poetry Night we turned
to a local theme," “I Hear Florida Sing-
ing.” Rhythmic groups in such songs
as “Camptown Races,” “Orange Blos-
som Trail,” and “Dixie Medley” de-
lighted the audience with color and
movement. This time all choric groups
spoke poems written by Florida poets.
To our great pleasure, we discovered
that Florida has a large and wonderful
group of native poets. “Florida” was
written by Vivian Laramore Rader, the
poet laureate of Florida. Seminole In-
dian songs and rhythms were demon-
strated in colorful native dress.

THE FOURTH Poetry Night, paying
tribute to William Shakespeare,
Whose four-hundredth Anniversary Cel-

PROGRAM

ebration was commemorated this year,
was planned around the bard and the
Elizabethan poets. To the regular
Poetry Contest was added a new classi-
fication, that of the Shakespearean
sonnet form, with interesting and un-
expected results. Even children and
teenagers vied in this category.

Augmenting this program, on April
24, a ceremonial tree-planting was
staged in the city park with the mayor
and other city ofiicials present. A beauv
tiful silver oak, one of the trees men-r
tioned by Shakespeare (and recom-
mended as suitable for the south Flori-
da climate) was planted with dedicatory
poetry readings from the bard. Walter
H. Adams, O.B.E., consul general from
Great Britain, spoke on the great poet
and the theater at Stratford-On-Avon.
The Bollinger Quintet played Eliza-
bethan music on recorders, an instru-
ment popular in the sixteenth century.

Creating and producing poetry pro-
grams will introduce you to many an
unsuspected poet or poetry lover!
When even the postman enters a poem
in the contest, and the popcorn man en-
thusiastically and generously furnishes
the handsome awards each year, then
you know you have touched upon a
universal chord and that poetry can be
made into a lively art! #

of poetry programs. See the special

Edward l. Ericson

"M M ANY individu-

al als suddenly
find themselves in
a bewildered panic
as summer ap-
proaches, trigger-
ed by vacation no-
tices coupled with
confusion of “Where shall I go, what
shall I do?”

They are bafHed about where to go,
what to do; how to get there, cost-plus
two; road maps, folders, pamphlets,
fares; how to find out, and who cares.
Is this an undercurrent in your com-
munity, installation, or corporation?
You, as a recreation leader,should care.

Most recreation programs are planned
for the leisure periods we associate
with everyday living patterns. What
about that precious, coveted block of
leisure time many lightly refer to as the
“vacation.” Many spend this time at
home year after year, in the same en-
vironment, doing the same things, see-
ing the same faces because they claim
they cannot afford it or, worse yet, be-
cause they just don’t know any new
place to go or new things to do. How
sad if we, as recreation leaders, allow
such a situation to exist in the minds of
our fellow townsmen or employe as-
sociates.

The person who believes “I just can-
not afford to take a vacation with my
family; the cost of accommodations is
prohibitive” is a person to be reached
and assisted. He requires an exterior
stimulus, a prodding spark from with-
out which will assist him to find a way
to enjoy his carefree vacation time
within the confines of his budget. Per-
haps he has never been exposed to
camping or other ventures which re-
quire minimum capital for a rich in-
vestment in his life experiences.

Promotion is a predominant part of
any open programing. We constantly
rack our brains for new “gimmicks,”

MR. ERICSON is recreation director for
the Travelers Insurance Company in
Hartford, Connecticut.

media, and vehicles to inform the pub-
lic of our programs and activity oppor-
tunities. In a country so exceedingly
rich in geographic variations, cradles
of history, natural resources, and topo-
graphic extremes, we have just recently
discovered the tourist appeal it has to
other countries. Europeans have placed
travel as a premium form of leisure ac-
tivity. Promotion then is the very core
of our success or failure to present, for
public acceptance, our ideas, creative
plans, and activity presentations.

In a travel promotion program,
throw away your required participant
statistics, for this is one of our many
areas of unsung service. There will be
no participating numbers for insertion
in an annual report, no volumes of
tangible evidence to support any pro-
found claims of success, but many citi-
zens will find a new path leading to in-
telligent use of leisure time.

HE Travelers Insurance Company,

located in downtown Hartford,
Connecticut, employs approximately
seventy-eight hundred persons in its
home office alone. Employes live both in
the city and in the many surrounding
suburban communities. Many of these
communities have a year-round recrea-
tion program and facilities, many do
not. Many employes wander aimlessly,
searching for activities and facilities
which will capture their imagination.

The company’s recreation and per-
sonnel staff promoted a vacation pro-
gram with one basic theme: “Be an In-
formed Vacation Traveler.” A “Travel
Mont ” Committee set the stage for
April “Travel Month.” Each workday
of the month was scheduled to feature
certain states and countries. This sched-
ule was then placed on a flyer and dis-
tributed to all employes.

News releases were placed in the
corporate newspaper, outlining the pro-
gram and presenting the schedule. Pre-
operative- and post-program photo
stories were printed in the newspaper,

DECEMBER, 1964

which created, maintained, and carried
over interest in the entire presentation.
Letters requesting travel folders, maps,
posters, 35MM slides, 16MM film, and
other brochure materials were sent to
state chambers of commerce, tourist
and development commissions, state
park commissions, European national
tourist offices, and airline companies.
A request for travel slides taken by em-
ployes was published in the newspaper
so experiences could be shared by all.

The program was divided into seven
component phases:

Reading Rack Distribution. All

brochure and related travel materials
were placed in four reading racks locat-
ed in areas of maximum utilization
throughout the company. Each rack
was accentuated bya large,multicolored
display panel which featured the names
of areas featured each day, and the slo-
gan “Travel—Your Venture to New
Horizons for Leisure Time.” Approxi-
mately 110,000 pieces of literature from
fifty states and sixteen European coun-
tries were distributed during the twen-
ty-one working days in April.

Noon-Hour Illovies. Sixteen milli-
meter films provided by state and Euro-
pean government agencies were shown
in the auditorium during the noon
lunch period. Each film coincided with
the areas featured on that day, or .with-
in a reasonable proximity. A continu-
ous showing provided all employes an
opportunity to take advantage of this
phase of the program.

Automatic Slide Projection. An
automatic, rear projection, slide ma-
chine was placed in the main serving
area of the employes’ restaurant. Slides
obtained from employes and govern-
ment agencies were shown continuously
so individuals waiting in line could
view at least one complete sequence of
slides which were coordinated with the
areas featured. All slide headings were
composed and produced by the public
information and advertising section.

Special Menu Feature. The Food
services section contributed to the pro-
gram by presenting special menu and
food varieties to coincide with areas
featured. Menus were attractively dec-
orated and featured such delicacies as:
Minnesota rice, chicken California, Ro-
many eggs, Belgian carrots, Maine sar-
dines, and many additional palate-tan-
talizing foods.

Special Displays. A special display of
Maine seafoods and frozen fish prod-
ucts was presented during New Eng-
land week by the food services section.
Large cardboard figures accentuated the
displays which were obtained from the
Sea Industries publicity department.
National costumes of Europe were dis-
played on mannikins amidst a back-
ground of posters and brochures of
the area.

Poster Utilization. The many pictur-
esque and colorful posters received
were mounted on a firm backing and
placed at the entrance of the auditorium
and at the base of the slide projector.
After program use, the posters were
given to the employes’ restaurant and
are being used to enhance the dining
areas and serve as a reminder of the
many exciting adventures awaiting
through travel.

Library Reference Shelf. Copies of
every travel brochure and map received
were compiled into a reference library.
The material was placed on a reference
shelf in the library where it is acces-
sible to anyone who desires the service.

The vital statistics of program suc-
cess are unmeasurable. The brochure
materials lasted only an hour and a
half maximum, movie attendance scored
over the standard norm, telephone in-
quiries for additional materials Bowed
steadily, and personal comment was
favorable and frequent. Here'is a pro-
gram which has maintained‘ the inter-
est, broadened the horizons, captured
the imagination, and we hope contrib-
uted to intelligent use of vacation lei-
sure time for the Travelers traveler. #

gifts; the sight of a street corner Santa can stimulate

us into creative action; snow flurries can turn our
thoughts to glitter, tinsel, ribbons, pine cones, holly, stars,
et cetera. The following simple, yet dramatic, projects can
be used to encourage Christmas imaginations.

THE SPOOL TREE"

MATERIALS NEEDED:

Wood

One block approximately five inches square.

One long strip approximately a foot long, a quarter inch high, and

one inch wide.

Eleven pieces of quarter—inch dowel cut an inch and half long.
Spools

One small spool approximately two and a quarter inches high.

Twenty-one spools approximately an inch and a quarter high.
Decorations

Fifteen marbles, beads, or small Christmas balls.

Cardboard, glitter, glue.
.- EQUIPMENT :

Paint brushes,
saw (coping).
DIRECTIONS :
The square block
of wood is the
base of the Christ-
mas tree. Glue
the large spool in
the center of the
block. Glue the
strip of wood to
the top of the
spool as shown.
Glue six spools
across the strip,
equally s p a c e d
and with the re-
maining spools build a pyramid as shown, gluing as you go,

THE JOY of Christmas giving can motivate us to create

 

ending with one spool on the top. Insert and glue the dowel

pieces in the hole of the spools in the outside rows. It is
suggested that the base and spools be painted green and the
dowels (representing candles) painted red. However, a tree

of any color combinations could be effective. You can vary

the size of the tree by varying the size of the spools used.

STAINED GLASS PROJECTS

This old and now popular media which was developed
centuries ago as “stained glass windows” can now be in-
troduced easily and economically in your crafts program.
(The old Tiffany lamp shades, which are all the rage at the
moment, with buyers and antique dealers combing the coun-
tryside for them, are an adaptati'in of this ancient art.)

MATERIALS :

glass stain thinner
(variety of colors) lead adhesive
lead tape 013”) alcohol

acetate
wax paper
tooth picks or Q-tips

tracing paper
glass—clear, smooth or textured
-—or plastics“

“Your local glass company will cut glass to any size. Plas-
tics can be purchased at your local lumber company. We
also suggest that inexpensive picture frames be purchased;
then you have the glass and the frame for use. All other
materials are available from Stain Glass Products, P.O. Box

756, Cleveland 22, Ohio.
EQUIPMENT: Brushes, razor blade or sharp pen knife

PICTURES
PROCEDURE

1. Make sketch of design on white paper which has been
cut to the exact size of glass piece to be stained. At first it
is advisable to keep designs simple, using large spaces and
areas. Small areas should be tried later as they require ad-
ditional learned techniques that can be achieved only after
becoming acquainted with using the medium. It is also ad-
visable to begin with a piece of glass approximately 8”x16”.

2. When final draft of design has been completed place
the glass over it. Clean the glass carefully with alcohol. Out-
line the design on the glass with the lead tape, using the lead
adhesive to adhere it. Cut the lead tape carefully making
certain the pieces fit tightly for accurate joining. Let sit
until thoroughly dry before beginning to apply the stain
glass transparent colors. The lead tape bends easily so that
designs containing circles and curves are no problem. Any
excess adhesive is easily removed with thinner.

3. The glass panel will need to be raised over a white
surface (or over a source of light if you have the equip-
ment) before applying the stain glass color. This will en-
able getting a truer color identification. Four small blocks
of wood (1”-11/3”) placed under the four corners of the

RECREATION

glass, or strips of wood can be used to support the glass over
the white surface.

4. Apply the stain glass colors according to your own
combinations and design. Shake colors well before using.
Use Q-tips or toothpicks to get colors into corners and along
Edges of the lead tape. Mix colors for interesting effects.
Use various brushes and other supplies, such as Q-tips,
sponges, eye droppers, gauze, squeeze bottles, et cetera to
create textures. (Experiment beforehand.) Using the fingers
or hands as in fingerpainting can also be effective and in-
teresting.

PANELS

The same process is used for making a stained glass panel
as for making a small picture. However, in creating a panel,
it is suggested that the glass be permanently set in a wooden
frame before decorating.

ORNAMENTS

Same process explained above; for easier cutting, it is
suggested that plastic be used. Cut ornaments in any size
or shape. Lead tape can be applied around the edges. This
will give the ornament depth and an outline.

Pointers:

Marbleized effects can be produced by swirling one color
over another.

Lead tape can be painted any color. We suggest silver or
gold.

Stain-glass colors can be applied by the old splatter
method using a tooth brush and pencil. Stain-glass colors
can also be applied to any of the glass bottles or decanters
that are “throwaway items” (wine, bath salts, perfume, sal-
ad dressing, syrups, et cetera) .

FUN FOIL

Keeping children happily occupied on snowy blowy days
can be a problem for any leader. With aluminum foil and
such other easy-to-lind items as old rubber balls, wooden
spoons, and construction paper, you can help youngsters
start their own puppet show, fashion foil into popcorn an-
imals, or brighten Christmas spirits with aluminum-foil
wreaths made in less time than it takes to wrap a present.

String
PROCEDURE.
("'ZIKW 1. Cut out six cir-

cles of paper about
eight inches in diame-
ter.
2. Fold each circle
three times—the fold-
ed circle now resem-
bles a cone (Fig. 1).
One side of the cone
has three folded edges
showing. Clip these
edges irregularly to
give a lacy appear-

 

ance when opened (Fig. 1

3. Open the circle and cut the other four fold lines to
within a half inch of the center of the circle (Fig. 2

4. Fold on the lacy edges. Fold sections opposite to one
another. Fold the sides of the first section down, the side
of the next section up, et cetera (Fig. 3).

5. String the circles one after another on a string, thread-
ing them through the center. Push the six circles tightly to-
gether at the end of the string and tie in place. Spread and
fluff them out and you have Christmas balls (Fig. 4).

HINTS: Make balls separately or series of them on a long
piece of string. Vary the colors of the balls or use several
colors for one decoration. Use more than six circles for one

decoration and it will be fluffier.

WEIGHT TRAINING
FOR
TEENAGERS

John Lambrosa, Director of Parks and
Recreation, Penn Yen, New York.

RECREATION di-
rectors in

small

 

 

large and
departments are
constantly search-
ing for programs
to interest hard-to-
reach male teen-
agers who do not usually participate in
the regularly scheduled programs of the
department. Highly competitive sports
activities will attract many teenage boys
who generally have the ability needed
to participate in such sports as basket-
ball, football, baseball, boxing, hockey,
and wrestling. However, there are many
boys who do not possess the basic tal-
ents and physical attributes needed to
compete in such sports. It is not uncom-
mon for these youngsters to engage in
less strenuous and less constructive

 

street-corner activities.

Weight training, properly supervis-
ed, can attract many teenage boys who
would like to participate in athletics
but lack the physical size, strength, and
stamina needed. A youngster does not
need to have athletic prowess to train
with weights, but should have a desire
for physical self-improvement. Increas-
ed strength and better muscle tone can
usually be observed in an individual
after five or six weeks of training,
thus serving as an additional incentive
to the boy to continue the program.

The initial cost of the barbell equip-
ment needed for forty or fifty young-
sters should not exceed $200. Weights
do not depreciate in value nor do they
wear out. Supplementary equipment
such as benches, barbell racks, situp
hoards, et cetera can easily be made by
the boys themselves from scrap lumber
or donated materials often available

516

to recreation departments. The depart-
ment should provide qualified instruc-
tion and adequate space and facilities.
The instructor should be able to encour-
age sound eating and living habits that
go hand in hand with exercise as a
means of providing physical fitness. It
is amazing how a youngster will adopt
sound living habits if it can aid him in
achieving a stronger body.

Many topnotch athletes use weight
training to help them excel in their
individual sports. They do not lift bar-
bells to become beach athletes who
strut their muscles like peacocks, but
they lift weights to help develop the
muscles used in their specialties. It
would not make any difference if a

 

These teenagers take their body building

basketball player had a fifty-inch chest
but it is important that he have strong
legs for rebounding and powerful wrists
and shoulders for ball control.

Not too many years ago it was
thought that weight training produced
muscle-bound men who were strictly
mirror athletes. Dr. Karpovich, re—
search professor of physiology at
Springfield College, helped dispel that
idea when he tested six hundred persons

between the ages of eighteen and thirty.
Three hundred of the men had at least

six months of weight training, of the re-
maining three hundred men; 150 were
athletes, and 150 were non-athletes but
the athletes were not weight trained,
neither were the non-athletes. A wheel-
like apparatus was used to measure the
arm and shoulder muscles performing
rotation. It was found that the weight-
trained men were fastest in muscle
movement, the athletes were second,
and the non-athletes were slowest in
muscle movement.

One of the main problems facing the
recreation director is to erase the many
misconceptions of the public about the
activity. How often a weight-trained
man will hear the comment, “weight
lifting gives you a bad heart.” The truth
is that weight lifting properly adminis-
tered will not injure a normal heart but
instead will strengthen the heart. The
heart is like any other muscle in the
body, and when exercised will get
stronger and will probably increase in
size. Years ago a larger heart in an
athlete’s body was called an athletic
heart and was considersd by the layman
to be an abnormal condition. It was
abnormal only because it was being
compared to the hearts of people who
did little exercise.

Perhaps the most famous argument
against lifting weights is that it causes
a hernia. Actually, hernias are caused
by weakness in the muscles surrounding
the wall of the abdominal cavity. If
an individual with a congenital condi-
tion lifts weights, he may very easily
develop a hernia but he could just as
easily get a hernia by coughing or
sneezing. If no congenital condition
exists, the chances of getting a hernia
through weight training are negligible.
Most often the individual who risks
injury in lifting weights is the smart
alec who, without any previous training
or instruction, proceeds to show how
strong he is. The results can be torn
muscles, wrenched backs, or possibly
a rupture.

Individuals considering weight train-
ing as a form of exercise should consult
their physicians before starting a pro-

RECREATION

gram. Recreation administrators should
request a physician’s approval slip of
possible participants. A man trained
in weightlifting should be secured to
teach the class. Often physical educa-
tion staff members of school systems
would be willing to teach a class and,
at the same time, have the athletes from
the local school systems take part in the
program. Your local public libraries
can secure books on the subject of
weight training if they do not have
them already.

Recreation-sponsored weight train-
ing programs are popular in California
and Florida. Many recreation admin-
istrators refuse to be involved in start-
ing weight training classes mainly
because they know little about the
activity itself. (See also “Recreation

Weight Training,” RECREATION, Jan-
uary 1964.)

 

5 PITCH
BASEBALL

 

Richard “Titch” Copeland, Recreation
Supervisor, Huntington Beach, Cali-
fornia.

A new approach
to baseball for
boys ten years of
age has been a big
success in Hunting-
ton Beach, Califor-
In 1961, we

had eight teams of
boys in this division playing ball with
the coaching being done by volunteers.
It was a poor situation most of the time
as the coaches were too gung ho or not
attempting to teach the youngsters any
of the fundamentals of the game. What
was especially irritating was seeing the
coaches encourage their boys to just
stand in at the plate and take a walk
when the pitcher was wild. How can a
boy learn to bat if he is told not to
swing? At the start of the 1962 season
we introduced 5 Pitch Baseball to the
boys, playing it in the mornings with
very few spectators present. The game
went over great with the boys and it
was then introduced on other play-
grounds with the kids enjoying baseball

for a change. We did lose a few boys,
but not enough to ruin any teams.

This year we had sixty teams organ-
ized in fifteen leagues with each team
playing a fifteen-game season. The
youngsters that came up to the eleven-
and twelve-year-old division this year
and that have been playing 5 Pitch
for a season or two are the boys getting
the hits this year in their leagues. Since
this game was introduced it has been
adopted by several other agencies.

This league was designed to intro-
duce the boys to the fundamentals of
baseball in an atmosphere of learning,
competition, and enjoyment. Most of
them lack the required skills to play
standard baseball as yet, but are past
the softball stage. This modified game
has proven to be a good system of
teaching team work, sportsmanship,
and beginning skills. Uniforms are cap
and T-shirts. Listed below are the rules
of play:

1. The ball shall be an official
rubber-covered sphere, ten inches in
diameter.

2. The bats shall not be larger than
official softball or little league baseball
size.

3. The bases shall be fifty feet with
the pitching distance to be thirty-eight
feet.

4. Gloves must be worn by each
player in the field.

5. Shoes must be worn by all players.
Metal cleats prohibited.

6. Seven players constitute a legal
team. Up to ten boys may play in the
field at one time, but all boys will bat in
turn. If more than ten are present,
fielders will rotate. ‘

7. The game shall consist of seven
innings or an hour and a half, which-
ever is sooner.

8. The pitcher will be from the team
that is batting, giving most of the play-
ers an opportunity to try pitching if

they desire. All pitches must be thrown
overhand.

9. Each batter will be allowed five
pitches to hit the ball.

10. A batter must hit the ball in
order to get on base.

11. No bunting allowed.

12. If a batted ball hits! the pitcher

or if the pitcher interferes with a batted
ball the batter is out.

13. Once a runner is on base he may
not lead off his base until the ball has
left the pitcher’s hand. He may advance
to the next base on a hit ball only.

14-. Only one base is allowed on an
overthrow at first base.

15. No runner is allowed to steal any
base.

16. Action will be stopped when an
infielder returns the.ball to the pitcher.
If a runner is more than halfway to a
base when the ball is thrown back to the
pitcher, the runner is entitled to the
next base.

17. In the event a boy shows excep-
tional skill he may be moved up to a
higher league of play if such an opening
occurs and he desires to move.
League Managers Duties: It shall be
the league manager’s duty to instruct
the boys in the proper stance, batting
swing, and other skills needed to play
baseball. He is in charge of the teams
in his area and shall remain impartial
to any one team in teaching the boys
the skills of the game. He shall position
himself between home plate and first
base during the game, making the neces-
sary calls at first and the other bases.
He shall keep the score and also make it
a point to see that every boy participat-
ing receives his turn at bat and in the
field. He may use a platoon system or
any other method to keep the boys play-
ing and learning. In other words, his
job is coaching, officiating, and super-
vising four teams or the number that
comprise his league. No other volunteer
coaching is required unless the leader
desires assistance from an interested
person. You may use volunteer coaches

to help you but you must retain control
of all of the teams.

TEEN CLUB
FORUM

 

Herbert Rathner, Chief, Personnel and

Training, Director of Personnel Serv-
ices, DCS/Personnel, Headquarters

USAFE.

M ORE THAN thirty thousand teenage

dependents of U.S. Military per-
sonnel stationed in various European
and Near East countries want and need
leisure-time opportunities similar to
those offered in the United States. This
is diflicult to obtain in a foreign land.

 

The camel will walk a mile for these teen-
agers during Fourth of July celebration
program at Wheelus Air Base in Libya.

They have an excellent opportunity to
travel and learn about Europe, but it is
difficult for them to participate in a
year-round, balanced program of leis-
ure-time activities with which they were
familiar back home. To meet this need,
the U.S. Forces in Europe encourage the
organization of teen clubs at their in-
stallations.

When the teen clubs were established

:18

however, they were faced with problems
in organization and programing. There-
fore, the European Teen Forum idea
evolved. This forum brings together
annually over three hundred teenage
and adult representatives from US mili-
tary communities in Europe for the pur-
pose of exchanging ideas and improv-
ing the program and scope of teen clubs.
It grew out of a definite need to help
clubs improve their programs and oper-
ation.

The forum began in 1958. At that
time a staff member of the American
Forces Network, Europe (AFN) was
traveling throughout Europe to conduct
weekly “record hop” dance programs
at the various teen clubs. During his
visits he was continually confronted
with such questions as “What are the
best hours of operation for teen clubs?
Should smoking be allowed? What is
the best method for obtaining chaper-
ones?”

To help the various communities
solve these and many other questions
and problems about teen club activities,
he discussed the situation with the rec-
reation division at Headquarters U.S.
Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) in
Wiesbaden, Germany, and at U.S.
Army, Europe (USAREUR), Head-
quarters in Heidelberg. Arthur E. Todd,

now director of National Recreation As-
sociation Field Services, was with
USAFE Headquarters at that time and
was instrumental in implementing the
first forum. From this initial contact
grew the idea of inviting all clubs in
Europe to a central place whereby they
could discuss their problems. The first
European Teen Time Forum was con-

ducted in Frankfurt in 1958.

Since then the forum has been con-
ducted annually during the Thanksgiv-
ing holidays, and attracts approximate-
ly three hundred delegates from fifty
U.S. military teen-club programs. With
words like “maturity” and “responsi-
bility” to prod them, the delegates dis-
cuss ways of improving their clubs,
themselves, and their local communi-

AIR F ORCE LAUNCHE

 

ties. To provide the spark for renewed
vigor in teen-club operations, the forum
offers a series of discussions covering
nearly every phase of teen-club activity.
The forum is sponsored jointly by the
U.S. Air Forces in Europe, U.S. Army,
Europe, and the European Recreation
Society.

Some of Europe’s best qualified
youth leaders volunteer to lead the dis-
cussion on program ideas, fund-raising
activities, operating small clubs, the
smoking problem, role of the adult in
the teen club, and similar topics. Since
the delegates come from military in-
stallations in E n g l a n (1, Germany,
France, Italy, Libya, Spain, and Tur-
key, many novel activities are discov-
ered. A few such activities are camel
rides in Libya, bicycle trips using Ger-
man hostels, canal trips in Holland,
pancake races in England, ice-sculpture
contests in Bavaria, and learning to
cook snails French style.

The discussion technique used is to
seek a consensus on problems of mu-
tual interest, such as:

Smoking. Most teen clubs permit
smoking if the members bring written
permission from their parents.

Mixing. They favor dividing teen
clubs into junior (7th 82 8th grades)
and senior (9th to 12th grades) groups,
rather than programing for them as one

club.
Adult Advisers. Adults should not

“run” the teen club nor make commit-
ments they cannot keep. They should
work with and not for the teen mem-
bers.

Attract Members. They feel the best
way to attract new members and to hold
onto the existing ones is to offer a good
variety of activities.

The annual get-together at the forum
has resulted in better management,
more varied programs to meet the var-
ied interests, and a competitive spirit
amongst the youngsters to further im-
prove their leisure-time opportunities.

AKIDEMY
AWARDS

 

John A. Turner, Recreation Director,
Homestead Air Force Base, Florida.

AS A PART of its observance of Na-

tional Recreation Month, Home-
stead Air Force Base, located at the
southern end of the Florida peninsula,
initiated its Annual Akidemy Awards
Presentations to honor youngsters on
base for achievements, efforts and con-

tributions not on the championship orv

all-star level. According to base ofhcials,
the new concept fulfills the need to mo-
tivate children of any- level or skill or
ability. In most awards programs, con-
ducted within the structures of the vari-
ous activities, only those children who
have enjoyed a high degree of success
are recognized. The Homestead con-
cept supplements this by providing for
recognition of those who try hardest,
but, for one reason or another, can
never be the “star.”

According to Colonel Edward D. Ed-
wards, commander of the 19th Bomb
Wing at Homestead, “A youth program
should logically be directed toward the
majority, not the very few highly
skilled or talented youngsters.” With
this basic idea as the keystone, the
Homestead Akidemy Awards program
was initiated, with all efforts directed
toward making the presentation of
awards to the majority a more signifi-
cant event than the awards to the few
highly skilled champions. After a dis-
cussion of the concept of recognition
for the steady but unspectacular chil-
dren, the leaders of all the base youth
activities groups enthusiastically en-
dorsed the program, and submitted the
names of those in their respective units
who met the qualifications of deep in-
terest and perseverance not yet con-
summated by a high degree of success.
In order to ensure the validity of the
nominations, which is dependent upon

DECEMBER, 1964

close personal knowledge of the child
by his leader, awards categories were
established only for the highly organ-
ized activities—Cubs, Brownies, Junior
Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Cadettes, Base-
ball, and Senior Girl Scouts.

The following excerpts from the nar-

rative descriptions of some of the award
categories illustrate the type of young-
sters the recreation officials were seek-
ing:
Junior Girl Scout Award: This girl
represents all those who are a little
older than the Brownies but the added
maturity is not easy to find . . . Her
dancing may not be all rhythm and
grace . . . But how could it be, when,
from the corner of her mind’s eye, she
sees herself at the controls of the jet
fighter that roars by outside? And,
when her troop sings their favorite
songs, her voice may be a little scratchy
and oflkey. Why not? It’s hard to sing
today with the voice that was used yes-
terday to shoot Indians. It’s difficult to
measure her real value to her troop be-
cause so much of her contribution is in
the area of teamwork and cooperation,
and helpfulness to others that you can’t
weigh or measure by any established
scale.

Boy Scout Award: This award is pre-
sented to the boy who personifies the
characteristics of the majority of scouts
wthose who put their hearts and ‘souls
into their efforts but, through no fault
of their own, usually do not achieve
that elusive goal of an Eagle Scout.
Perhaps they may erect a tent that is
not completely taut, and maybe their
reflector ovens produce some foods
that are only slightly edible—and may-
be they can’t identify poison ivy until
the swelling goes down. But, through
it all, their interest grows, and using
each little error as a rising base, they
grow taller and straighter, and, most

important, lift their buddies along with
them.

Boy’s Baseball Award: This award is

presented to the boy who represents all
the young ball players forming the

background against which the few star

whom the star player could not exist.
These boys may not pitch a no-hit game
or hit the game-winning homer; they
may not steal the base at the crucial
time or throw the runner out at home
plate. But they’re always there when
they’re needed. They are the first to
show up for practice and the last to go
home. They are the boys who frequent-
ly wear out the seats of their uniforms
before any other part. Even on the
bench, they cheer loudest for every
play; they congratulate the momentary
star with deepest sincerity, pleased to
the soles of their scuffed-up shoes that
their team mate has been successful;.
and when the serious error is made, they,
with tears in their own eyes, assure the
other boys that it really doesn’t matter,
that there will be another chance. These
are the boys to whom that battered old
uniform is a knight’s armor, a symbol
of all the good things that can happen
to a boy, to whom that worn old glove
is a key to wonderful places; to whom
a broken bat is a faithful old friend to
be nursed back to health‘withitape and
nails and who knows what else—-—to be
used again when the warm spring
breeze makes the leaves whisper, “Play

Ball.”

After the nominations were received,

519

a panel of impartial judges interviewed
each nominee to determine the child in
each category who best characterized
the majority of participants. At the
conclusion of the interviews, with the
nominees rated on a numerical scale,
the names of the winners were placed
in envelopes and sealed, to be opened
only on stage the night of the presenta-
tions.

On the night of the event, through
the courtesy of the local musicians’
union, a sixteen-piece orchestra pro-
vided entertainment and background
music as required. Chuck Zink, who as
“Skipper Chuck” in children’s shows is
considered the most p0pular personality
of the Miami area, carried the major
burden of reading the category narra-
tives and assisting in the awards pre-
sentations. The mood and tempo of the
evening was established with a keynote
speech by the official host for the event,
Lt. Col. Joseph D. Kelly. This theme
was carried through in additional com-
ments by the commanders of the major
units on base, spaced between the vari-
ous awards. Background music and
selective lighting were used to increase
the impact of the narratives as read by
Mr. Zink. As each nominee’s name was
read, the children moved to the stage
to receive a certificate of achievement,
and when all children in any particular
category were on stage, one of the com-
manders announced in true Academy
style, “And the winner is . . .” The
opening of the sealed enveIOpe provided
an added measure of suspense, and, fin-
ally, the winner stepped forward to re-
ceive the trophy.

The trophy presented to each of the
winners was not “Oscar” or “Emmy”
but “Charlie Brown,” through Special
permission of United Features Syndi-
cate which publishes the “Peanuts” car-
toon feature. In the words of Base Com-
mander, Colonel Henry B. Hohman,
“Charlie Brown” was selected to sym-
bolize the program because “Charlie is
the little boy who is always depicted as
trying to do his best, sometimes with
success, sometimes not. But he’s al-
ways present to do a job that has to
be done.”

One of the technically interesting as-
pects of the program itself was the use
of mood lighting and spotlights with
background music to control crowd

520

noise. With more than a thousand chil-
dren and parents overflowing the base
service club, crowd noise was a factor
that could have interfered with proper
reception of the narratives upon which
so much of the program depended. It
was found that the gradual diminishing
in size of the spotlight on the narra-
tive reader focused not only visual but
auditory attention. As the spotlight, for
example, became smaller, until only the
head and shoulder of the narrator were
visible, the crowd noise dropped to a
whisper, and the professional narrator
was able to capitalize on this by gradu-
ally lowering his voice until virtually
the whole audience was on the edge of
their seats.

Base ofEcials are enthusiastic about
the effect this type of program will have
on participation in the youth program.
If each child realizes that he or she, re-
gardless of the level of ability, can re-
ceive recognition simply by working in
his activity to the best of his ability,
then the various activities can be ex-
pected to become more effective in
achieving their objective of construc-
tive, leisure-time utilization with con-
comitant carryover values also being
realized.

TRAINING FOR
MILITARY PROGRAMS

Robert M. Dula, Recreation Director,
Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska.

EXPERIENCE is the best teacher! “The

eXperience which I received from
working with Lincoln Air Force Base
on its summer recreation programs has
broadened my conception of recreation.
Through this tremendous program I
was able to sample practically every
area in recreation. I am deeply grate-
ful for this opportunity and will cherish
memories of this summer ob forever.”

 

 

 

Susan Spotless says:

KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL

 

These were the words of Roger Chil-
ders, a recreation major from Florida
State University, who had just com-
pleted a summer of military recreation
experlence.

The program of coordination be-
tween Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebras-
ka, and cooperating universities first
began in 1962. Early that year the base
recreation director coordinated with
Dr. William Tait, director of the recre-
ation curriculum at FSU, to arrange for
a student to gain recreation experience
at the Lincoln Air Force Base. This
summer the base had a student from
the University of Omaha as its trainee.

At Lincoln Air Force Base, the ar-
rangements were made by the recrea-
tion director. Approval was obtained
from the base commander and mem-
bers of the Central Base Fund Council.
Arrangements were made to allocate a
budget from nonappropriated funds for
the student’s housing and food. The
male student arranged to pay his own
transportation to the base from his
home town.

The newly arrived student quickly
finds himself engaged in recreation prov
gram activities and facilities. Among
the special activities he experiences are
directing the annual base swimming
and diving carnival, supervising the
summer base playground, making ar-
rangements for the 4th of July fire-
works show, coaching a girls’ softball
team, and promoting the base tennis
tournament.

His time is invested in working at the
base recreation facilities, consisting of
the Community Center Service Club
(and the arts and crafts programs) , the
youth center; gymnasium, airmen’s
swimming pool; Bowling Lake Lodge
and Marina; auto and wood, ceramic,
leathercraft, and photography hobby
shops.

The student finds a new recreation
experience and is able to contribute
many new ideas. The base recreation
director helps the student to experi-
ment with new recreation programs.
chkly sessions are held regarding pro-
grams and problems.

The over-all success of the program
has been profitable to the college, to
the student, and to the base. It is highly
recommended to other military installa-
tions and colleges.

I I PON SEEING the

modern recre-

and playground
areas in Opelika,
Alabama (popula-
tion, 18,000), visi-
tors and newcomers alike rarely fail to
ask, “How did a city of this size de-
velop and finance such fine facilities?”

 

Opelika, a wide-awake, progressive city,
is called the “Trading and Industrial
Center of East Alabama.” It boasts a
stable economy of diversified agricul-
tural and industrial interests. To back
up its claims to being a city with a fu-

ture, Opelika was chosen as the site of
US. Rubber’s twenty-one million dollar
plant two years ago.

Opelika’s selection above many cities
competing for this industrial prize was
the result of many factors, not the least
of which was its broad recreation pro-
gram and the recent addition of two
fully equipped community centers and
swimming pools. Opelika organized a
full-time parks and recreation depart-
ment in 1948, under a municipal en-
abling act of the Alabama legislature.

A good public-relations program was
one of the prerequisites for Opelika’s
recreation and industrial development.
Opelika received an unusual amount of
publicity and recognition following the
completion of its two new community
recreation centers with swimming pools,

at a cost of $385,000. These new facil-

ities were occupied June 1, 1962, and
have been used extensively since that
time. General obligation bonds were
issued for the above amount but only
after a public referendum was held to
determine if the citizens felt this much
money should be spent for new facili-
ties. The referendum passed by a mar-
gin of four to one.

Good public relations led to this city-
wide acceptance. Public relations, in
its simplest form, is your department’s
relations with the public it serves; in
other words, how well do you serve your
public with programs and how well do
you work with them? This is true pub-
lic relations no matter what gimmicks
you employ to gain public support.

Of all the material I have read on

tonnes!“ CENTER ma POOL

 

Good public relations led to this citywide acceptance. Cen-
ters, designed by the Charles ll]. Graves Organization of At-
lanta, opened in 1962, have been used extensively ever since.

521

public relations in recreation, the most
effective formula for success has never
been emphasized enough and, in many
cases, not at all. What is this formula?
Simply this: Your board or commis-
sion, you as the executive, your staff
and your entire department must con-
stantly be doing the best possible job
in providing a well-rounded program
for all ages and interests—as good as
can be provided with the facilities and
resources available. This effort must
be day in and day out, month in and
month out, year in and year out.

RECREATION is still a new profession
and still has to prove to the public
the importance and value of its services.
Being accepted as a municipal service is
one thing, but being demanded as a
public service is yet another. If your
department is doing a creditable job in
all areas of service, then it is bound to
be practicing “good public relations.”
Only when a department is doing the
job it should be doing is a department
“eligible” to employ some of the routine
gimmicks of public relations.

Naturally, we should always continue
the elementary procedures of keeping
the public informed through every pos-
sible media: newspapers, radio, TV,
fiyers, school announcements, posters,
brochures, speeches, et cetera. Effective
publicity for any program or event must
tell the public what is going to take
place; publicize the program in prog-
ress; and “wrap up” what happened—
using names as much as possible.

You must “see” yourself, your prod-
uct, or your service to the public. If
public relations is “being a good sales-
man,” as many have pointed out, then
we cannot hope to do much selling with-
out a quality product and a quality
service to offer. Campaigns for addi-
tional funds and new facilities have
failed because they were based on what
a tremendous job the department could
do if only it had more money and addi-
tional facilities. This is putting the cart
before the horse. Naturally, a better
job could be done but the public wants
to know, “What is the department doing
with what it has?”

Obviously, there is much more to
good public relations than providing a
quality program of activities, although
this is paramount. The next most im-

Opelika’s “thank-you” to volunteers

portant step is not just to inform the
public but to involve the public. If the
parks and recreation department in
Opelika has had any success with pub-
lic relations, it can be credited in great
measure to the practice of involving
the public in programs and facility im-
provements. Too many recreators
would rather maintain their independ-
ence of operation than take the time to
cultivate the skill and talent at hand in
every community. We should cultivate
the support and cooperation of special-
interest groups, civic clubs, and other
community organizations. These groups
represent a sizable percentage of the
real backbone and moving force behind
the progress in any municipality.
Individuals want to share their spe-
cial skills with others. Organizations
usually are eager to cosponsor a worthy
program, making available their name,
their manpower, and oftentimes finan-
cial support. Community assistance,
however, should never replace depart-
ment leadership. Just as a department
should not play a self-sufficient role,
neither should a department permit a
group to become entirely autonomous.

WHILE the above factors represent
the “big picture” in the public
relations practiced by the Opelika Parks
and Recreation Department, we try not
to overlook the small things which take
so little time and effort but yet mean so
much. The most effective of these is just
a plain “Thank You.” A telephone call
or a short note of appreciation for even
the smallest service is not only proper
but helps create department good will.
The presentation of Certificates of Ap-
preciation at a special cermony at the
close of a program year is very effective
and yet inexpensive. One year we held
a “Sunday Sundae” for all volunteers.
We simply served ice-cream sundaes on
a Sunday afternoon.

Successful public relations can also
mean successful bond issues! Any city
can have any service or facility if its
citizens want it badly enough to pay
for it. This would be a fair appraisal of
the situation in Opelika prior to the
successful recreation bond issue cam-
paign.

Prior to the 1961 referendum, two
campaigns with the park board and the
parks and recreation department doing
most of the work never got off the
ground. Then, in late 1958 and early
1959, a group of citizens, mothers, and
civic-club representatives formed a
committee called “Citizens for Recrea-
tion” with new community centers and
pools their objective. Our department
guided their efforts which culminated
with a formal proposal to the park
board and the city commissioners. This
proposal included a construction bud-

get and new sources of revenue.

The work of this independent com-
mittee, “Citizens for Recreation,” was
so effective in arousing public support
that the board of commissioners adopt-
ed the idea for a much broader study of
the city’s needs. This led to the official
appointment of several citizen study
committees, not only in recreation but
for schools, public works, public safety,
financing, et cetera. All reports of these
study committees were adOpted, includ-
ing the passage of a one percent gross
receipts tax.

When the referendum was announc-
ed, all groups interested in its passage
were quite confident of favorable re-
sults. However, nothing was taken for
granted. These individuals, special-in-
terest groups, civic clubs, and other or-
ganizations—whose good will had been
cultivated over the previous ten-year
period—were called upon to support
the campaign. There were enough
“friends of recreation” working active-
ly in the campaign to insure a favorable
vote. The final result of the referen-
dum, July 25, 1961, was a convincing
endorsement of the department’s ser-
vices as well as approval for new facili-
ties.

What is “public relations”? It is
quite hard to define, but you cannot beat
hard work and hundreds of dedicated
citizens who are vitally involved in im-
proving their community with modern
recreation facilities. if:

Park Inventory

A state-by-state inventory of some forty-eight hundred

existing non-urban park and related areas, and twenty-
eight hundred additional areas recognized by various sur-
veys as meriting public protection and management because
of their important scenic, scientific, historic and recreation
values has been compiled by the National Park Service
in cooperation with state and local park organizations in
fifty states, and other federal agencies with land manage-
ment responsibilities. Parks for America is the Park
Service’s last report in the field of integrated nationwide
outdoor recreation and park planning. These functions have
been transferred to the Department of the Interior’s
Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.

Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall points out in
a foreword that data in Parks for America were compiled
prior to April 1962 and have not been updated since then.
The 88th Congress has passed hills which President J ohn-
son has signed into law, authorizing National Park System
status for a number of areas covered by the survey. “This
report is published at the request of many of the states to
assist in their park planning and legislative programs,”
Secretary Udall writes in the foreword. “The Department
of the Interior acknowledges with sincere appreciation the
fine cooperation received frOm the states, the federal agen-
cies and local planning groups which made publication
of this report possible.”

State summaries within each region include resumes, state
maps, and tabulations of existing and potential parks,
monuments, recreation areas, parkways, scenic roads, trails,
and free-flowing streams. The live hundred—page Parks for
America is on sale through the Superintendent of Docu-
ments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC,

attractive 9’ ’ -by-111/_3” publication with many beautiful half-
tone illustrations and maps in color.

Boating Facilities Plan

A LONG-RANGE PLAN for meeting the pressing need for
additional harbors and boating facilities in California
was recently completed by a private consulting firm for
presentation to the California Small Craft Harbors Commis-
sion and the State Legislature. The feasibility study was
made possible with funds provided by the legislature and a
federal urban-planning grant. Known as the “California
Boating Plan,” the presentation is striking in its colorful
format and comprehensiveness. It is divided into three vol-
umes, the first being a summarized form of the total plan.
The second volume titled the Comprehensive Report contains
technical data supporting conclusions and recommendations
for boating facility developments. It is available in limited
quantity at $6 per copy. The third volume known as the
“Interim Report on Coastal Harbors of Refuge” is valuable

DECEMBER, 1964

to boatmen traveling the coastal waters of the state. It can
be purchased from the Division of Small Craft Harbors at

$3.75 per copy.

The California Boating Plan proposes a development pro-
gram of $10,000,000 per year in order to be able to meet
the facilities demands anticipated by 1975. It is not sug-
gested that the entire cost should be borne by the state. Pub-
lic hearings will be held by the California Small Craft
Harbors Commission and the State Legislature in order to
obtain expressions of public interest regarding the “plan”
and an implementing program. Following these hearings,
the commission will amend the “plan” if necessary, and
adopt it as a guide for future activities in the development
of harbors and boating facilities. For further details write

Families Adrift

P ARENTS who “couldn’t care less” about their children’s
behavior away from home are likely to raise “irre-
sponsible” offspring—and be blamed for it by their own
teenage children. That is the finding of a survey reported
in the June issue of The PTA Magazine, official publication
of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. Kenneth
Erickson, superintendent of schools in Corvallis, Oregon,
details the opinions he collected from students at Wilson
High School in Portland in a study of citizenship education:

“The teenagers’ replies seem almost to be an appeal to
parents for a firm guiding hand. . . .”

“Most students (82%) expressed a strong conviction that
parents have—or should have—a major role in helping
young people to become good citizens.

“The young people showed their disapproval of what we
might call a hands-off policy by parents—the policy of let-
ting children make their own decisions on schoolwork,
friends, choice of careers, religion, and other important
mamm”

Mr. Erickson reports: “Many adolescents would like
clearer rules on late hours and dating. They don’t want the
burden of setting their own limits. A child needs to know
beyond a doubt that his parents care more for him than for
wealth or possessions or their own social or business activi-
ties. . . . The child who is neglected or rejected for any
reason gets the message. He knows he is ‘worthless’ and
his feeling of worthlessness may start him down the road
of rebellion and definance”——toward misbahavior and ir-
responsible citizenship.

He suggests that PTA’s might help families to score them-
selves on values, attitudes, and habits of each member—
father, mother, children. Since today “the usual American
family has no grandparent or other specialist in its home to
help it evaluate its goals, its child-rearing practices, the rela-
tions among family member,” he declares, such an objective

523

self-evaluation might encourage improvements in the “care
less” families.

Without it, Mr. Erickson warns, “Many American fami-
lies are drifting along without a clear sense of direction.
Having taken off on our child-rearing course in the full
bloom of youthful ignorance . . . some of us just stay air-
borne without check on our direction.

“When we observe other parents’ mistakes, we are sure
they must be traveling without a compass. The faults of
other families, like the other fellow’s headlights, always
seem more glaring than our own. But we would do well, I
think, to take a look at our own family course before we
start setting others right.”

Marina Services

TJE MAJORITY of boat owners who use marinas seek in-

stallations that are clean, safe, and offer willing service
from competent personnel, according to a recent survey con-
ducted by the National Association of Engine and Boat Man-
ufacturers. The survey, entitled Some Boat Owner Impres-
sions of Marina Services, is based on 431 completed ques-
tionnaires returned from a group of 1,970 boatmen. The
reSpondents, owners of cruising craft, were asked to classify
various marina services and facilities as either important,
desirable, or unimportant.

whlch there was unanimlty. In general, the availabillty and
adequacy of services and supplies, as well as the presence
of fire and safety precautions, scored high on the list of
boatmen’s preferences. Top three scores were: cleanliness
of premises, 97.8 percent; fire and safety precautions, 88.9
percent; and willingness of personnel to render service, 87.8
percent.

Once the skipper has found his berth in a marina, he ex‘
pects the installation to offer certain required facilities. For
the first time, the NAEBM survey revealed the fifteen ma-
jor facilities wanted by the boat owner as indicated by per-
centage of owners classifying the following as important or
desirable: water, 96.0 percent; fuel, 94.2 percent; repair
service, 90.0 percent; showers, 89.1 percent; ice, 88.9 per-
cent; marine supplies, 87.0 percent; tide and weather in-
formation, 86.3 percent; electricity, 85.0 percent; restau-
rant, 80.5 percent; credit-card privileges, 78.7 percent; gars

bage collection, 75.2 percent; groceries, 74.4 percent; park-
ing, 72.5 percent; telephone connection, 65.6 percent, and

laundry services, 62.7 percent. Copies of the survey are

CONCERNING UPKEEP

 

Ingenuity at Work

YOU HAVE TO BE ingenious to be a
maintenance man! The Mariners
Museum in Newport News, Virginia,
keeps its trees ship-shape with a welding
machine! It is an unlikely but ingeni-
ous use for a metal-working tool. The
Mariners Museum houses a superb col-
lection of naval artifacts and provides
a magnificent setting for the collection
in an 880-acre park with elm and oak
trees.

According to James E. Larson, the
museum’s superintendent of buildings
and grounds, keeping elm and oak trees
fit at Mariners Museum Park these days
requires constant care. That’s where
the welding machine comes in. The
trees are made to take nutriment and
medication through a series of 24-inch
holes drilled every twenty-four inches
in a circle directly under the “drip line”
or outside the edge of the tree branches.
When scores of trees need attention, as
was Mr. Larson’s problem recently,
drilling the holes by hand would be too

 

time-consuming and expensive—also
electrical equipment would require a
power source. Mr. Larson tried a mo-
bile welder (product of the National
Cyclinder Gas Division of Chemetron
Corporation) with a 12.8HP air-cooled
gasoline engine, attaching an electrical
drill to it. The machine mounted on a
two-wheel dolly assembly makes it easy
to move to reach trees over a large area.
Further information regarding the mo-
bile welding machine (NCG SGW-ZOI)
can be obtained from the Chemetron
Corporation, 840 North Michigan Ave-
nue, Chicago 60611.

‘Soft’ Detergents

ATURAL soil processes can effec-
tively dispose of the new “soft”
detergents and thus alleviate further de-
tergent pollution of the nation’s under-
ground water supplies. This is the indi-
cation from extensive tests conducted

by University of California sanitary
engineers. Their findings add to evi-
dence that the new detergents now com-
ing on the market may spell the end of
the unsightly build-up of frothy suds on
many lakes and streams, as well as the
unpleasant persistance of detergents in
some well water supplies.

The detergent studies are part of a
long-term effort by the U.C. group to
understand the role of the soil in sewage
disposal and to find new ways of safe-
guarding against ground and surface
water pollution. Responding to recent
pollution problems and to the possibil-
ity of government regulation, manufac-
turers have developed new detergent
chemicals that are termed “biodegrad-
able”; that is, they are more easily
broken down and converted to non-

foaming substances by natural biologi-
cal processes.

 

Lawn Bowling

mains the only major sport that has not
been commercialized, and it continues
to be enjoyed through personal parti-
cipation rather than by spectators,
which, after all, is the acid test. There
is another major factor to be considered
in evaluating it. Among sports partici-
pants, generally, less than five percent
have been endowed with aptitude that
permits them to become t0p performers.
Now, our leisure hours have more than
doubled, our college and university stu-
dent bodies are from five to ten times
greater than they were at the turn of
the century, and, wherever you look,
personal participation in recreation is
an outstanding need of the times. An-
other need is for interesting activities
that can appeal to larger numbers, and
this is where lawn bowling comes in.

DECEMBER, 1964

The game becomes outstanding when
considered in relation to the fact that
all ages of both sexes can participate.
Certainly, public recreation programs
that do not include lawn bowling are
not adequate to serve many of those
seventeen or eighteen million senior
citizens with active recreation.- The
group aged sixty-five and over comes
close to ten percent of our national pop-
ulation, and this large group needs rec-
reation suited to advanced years and
depleted vigor.

WHILE recreation directors may say,
“We have received no requests for
lawn bowling in our community”; or
“I do not think it is proper to go all out
for lawn bowling to the neglect of other
sports,” the time has come when the
recreation director must be able to de-
tect the hidden needs of the people.
The qualified recreation director is, so
to speak, a recreation physician who
prescribes those facilities and programs

best suited to the needs of the people.
He exposes them to new ideas and ac-
tivities, thus assuring a more abundant

life for all. We should not go all out
for lawn bowling only, or for any single
one of our many fine sports, for that
matter. All sports, including lawn
bowling, will thrive and prosper best
when made a component part of a well-
balanced public recreation program.
There is a growing tendency to think
that public recreation facilities should
be made self-sustaining to a very marked
degree. Conceivably, there is some
merit in this, if it is not overdone. A
$3.00 or $4.00 golf green fee on a pub-
lic golf links certainly approaches the
ridiculous and defeats the purpose for
which this facility was created. As with
public education procedure, so with rec-
reation services, we are striving to build
that morale which is so definitely relat-
ed to the best interests of our country

and its future.

NIAGARA’S
ENCHANTED
FOREST

 

Some one hundred units, comprised of mercury units and incandescent pro-
jector units, are placed in fifty trees and on buildings to illuminate the land-
scape at Queenston Heights Park, Niagara Falls, Ontario, and add to safety.

An illuminated landscape offers a special beauty

Maxim T. Gray
N HOLY Writ it is recorded “that men
Ilove darkness rather than light.”
This cannot be said of Ontario’s
Niagara Park Commission, at least, in
the realm of lighting its parks. Queen-
ston Heights Park [Niagara Falls,
Ontario] is a playground in the day-
time, as God’s sun sheds its rays
of lights upon this beautiful land-
scape, but a mere mass of dark uninter-
esting shadows at night. The foregoing
statement was true not too many
months ago before the commission be-
came interested in landscape illumina-
tion. John \Vatson, from Dallas. Texas,
a “t‘t‘hgnizt‘ll authority in the field,
was "-UllSUlliill and an area in Queenston
Heights Park was selected for treat-

systems. Landscape lighting is a com-
paratively new area. It is not ust a case
of stringing a few lights through the
trees, and the treatment is not to be
confused with floodlighting. It is rather
a subtle form of illuminating the area
by the discreet use of lighting units
placed in the trees. It is h0ped this
futuramic move by the Niagara Parks
Commission will encourage other park
systems and municipalities to investi-
gate the possibilities of such a program
for their districts. Those who have
visited our fairyland of lights go away
as good ambassadors for the Niagara
Parks Commission. Truly, we can say
that the park is being utilized to the
best advantage.

By the use of reflected and direct
light, the well-manicured flower beds,
plants, and trees in the summer and the
winter elements in the winter are paint-
ed with soft moonlight coating. An area
of special beauty, by day or by night. is
the colorful foundation and adjacent
planting at the Queenston Heights
Restaurant, poised on the edge of the
\iagara escarpment.

Some hundred mercury and incan-

descent projector units are placed in
fifty trees and on buildings. Each instal-
lation was carefully planned months
ahead. Much groundwork, time and
study preceded the actual time of instal-
lation. Ten thousand feet of wiring was
required and four thousand feet of
underground trenches dug. The differ-
ent units were placed forty to sixty feet
in the trees, using the best location to
beautify the area. The mechanics of the
system fade into the background and
into nature. The system was planned to
give the least maintenance problem
possible. Along with the added beauty of
this Queenston Heights area the safety
factor is important. Queenston Heights
Park and area are now much safer for
all to enjoy at night. Without exagger-
ating it can he said that this landscape
illumination at Queenston is one of the
most outstanding attractions in the en-
tire park system.

We extend to each of you a most cor-
dial invitation to come and place your-
self in this combined atmosphere of
historic interest and formal garden
display, simply a wonderland, no mat-
ter what your particular interest. #

f RECRUITMENT SERIES #2

are you talking about! “This is

' the answer that we receive from
many of the top young people today
when it is suggested they might con-
sider a career in recreation. In a recent
doctoral dissertation, Factors Related to
the Recruitment of Personnel, Dr.
Byrne C. Fernelius found that 313 stu-
dents, or 31.5 percent of recreation
major students, questioned about nega-
tive factors which deterred them from
choosing a career in recreation an-
swered “the lack of information about
recreation.” Dr. Fernelius found that:

R’ECREATION? What in the world

0 Present recruitment programs are
not meeting the demand for profession-
ally prepared recreation graduates.

. A stronger emphasis is needed in
recruiting recreation major students
for college or university freshman

classes.

0 A large proportion of people in the
recreation profession do not seem to be
aware of the influence they can exert on
potential recreation major students.

0 Among non-school pe0ple, recreation
leaders appear to exert the strongest
influence in guiding students to choose
a career in recreation.

0 Persons in the recreation profession
should be alerted to their responsibili-
ties of watching for students who show
talent and interest in various recreation
pursuits, and who appear to enjoy
working with people.

0 Participation of youth, in well-bal-
anced programs in recreation agencies,
has a tendency to influence them to look
favorably toward a career in recreation.
0 Experiences both as a leader and as
a follower in organized sports appear to
exert a stronger amount of influence
on students to choose a career in recrea-

tion than do other leadership and fol-
lowership experiences outside of our
schools.

0 Among school personnel, athletic
coaches appear to have exerted the
greatest influence on students to choose
a career in recreation.

o The college undergraduate school
level appears to have been the most
effective school level for influencing
students to choose a career in recrea-
tion.

0 The standards of the receation pro-
fession should be constantly raised to
attract outstanding people into the
profession.

0 Young men and women working in
camps, aquatics, playgrounds, little
leagues and in other recreation pursuits
appear to be excellent prospects for rec-
reation major students.

0 Recreation major students appear to
be strong agents in recruiting other
students to enter the field of recreation.
0 There appear to be many factors
which influence students to choose a
career in recreation, and the effective-
ness of recruitment practices appears
to vary throughout the National Recre-
ation Association’s field districts. In
the New England District on the east
coast, the recruitment practice of stu-
dent visitations to college and univer-
sity campuses exerted the strongest in-
fluence, while in the Pacific Northwest
District on the west coast, it was the
influence of other recreation major
students. #

NEW PUBLICATIONS

 

An Introduction to the Teaching of
Dance, Elizabeth R. Hayes. Ronald
Press, 15 East 26th Street, New York
10010. Pp. 340, illustrated. $5.00.

THE AUTHOR is professor of health,
physical education and recreation
and director of the dance major pro-
gram of the University of Utah. She
has headed up the dance section of the
AAHPER and is well-known in dance
education. Her book, as would be ex-
pected, is written primarily for dance
instructors at the college or university
level. She has called on a number of
other well-known educators and dancers
and used their help to strengthen her
book. The authors premise, as stated
in the first two short chapters on “Dance
as Education,” that dance is rhythmic
movement that like beauty (perhaps as
beauty) is its own excuse for being, will
please dancers and dance instructors
not concerned with the academic dance
curricula. At the same time, leaders in
the cultural arts in recreation programs
will find many methods and techniques
that will strengthen their more inform-
al approach to the dance.

Chapters on approaches to modern
dance, teaching social dancing creative-
ly, and the selecting and teaching folk
dances include many valuable ideas for
presentations and evaluations. A chap-
ter on dance performances and appen-
dices that include a constitution for a
modern dance club, piano and record
resources, and suggested recordings for
modern social and folk dances add to
the value of the book. It is an excellent
resource for the college and university
library, physical education departments,
and the serious instructor of the dance,
wherever he or she may function—

V.M.

Reinhold Craft and Hobby Book,
Guenther Voss. Reinhold Publishing,
430 Park Avenue, New York 10022.
Pp. 360, illustrated. $8.95.

Tz-ns BOOK, translated from the Ger-
man, is not a simple, scrapcraft
book of ideas, but a detailed instruction
book by an expert craftsman who takes
pride in his work and thinks that work-
ing creatively with one’s hands is a
valuable way to use leisure. Three chap-
ters are devoted to explanations of the
structure and nature of materials, such
as wood, metal, and plastics, tools and
their use, and a glossary of terms in
ear-.h craft. Woodwork, ornament and
block printing, metal under the ham-

I<28

mer, bookbinding, woven rugs and
prints, braiding and basketmaking,
clay, lamps, mosaics, and handmade
jewelry are explored and explained,
with colorful and helpful illustrations.

The last half of the book is an en-
largement of the scope of play—through
creative work with the hands. A doll’s
house and furniture, puppets and mari-
onettes, Christmas toys and ornaments,
archery, and a number of nature proj-

ets are included.

A craftsman or anyone interested in
learning to be a craftsman, will enjoy
and appreciate this book. Every page
shows careful work in making instruc-
tions clear, so that ultimately the hob-
byist can be proud of the work of his
hands. A valuable book—for the right

person.

Fun and Fundamentals of Sculpture,
Marjorie Dainaerfield. Charles Scrib-
ner's Sons, 597 Fifth Avenue, New
York 10017. Pp. 95, illustrated. $3.95.

HE AUTHOR is well-known as an au-

thority on sculpture and is a profes-
sional sculptress and teacher. Her book
is written simply but thoroughly—just
as she teaches—with emphasis on the
very important things to watch while
working. One feels this author is speak-
ing directly to you personally—with
a bit of humor and the wonderful phil-
osophy of a creative person. The print
is large and easily read. The black-
and-white photographs and drawings
are large and well chosen.

Though the book has only ninety-five
pages, the subject is well covered. The
author does not try to teach anatomy
in this small book but her illustrative
line drawings tell much, and her com-
parison of parts of the body with fa-
miliar objects are amusing. They are
described in such a way as to make the
work a lot of fun.

She does emphasize the importance
of the study of anatomy, however, and
gives enough information to help the
beginner understand thoroughly. As I
read this book I remembered how hard
it was for me to understand and learn
anatomy in the years when we did not
have as many helpful books like this one
to give the student the courage and in-
centive to keep on even through failure.

Quoting from the book, “There is
probably no joy equal to the joy of cre-
ation. Painting is representation, music
is often just interpretation, but sculp-
ture is creation. To take a meaningless

lump of clay, to see it begin to assume
shape, the feel of it in your hands. . . .
to begin to see rhythm, motion, life
evolve—here is a thrill those who nev-
er try it never know. . . . ” A fine book
for just anyone—Mary B. Cummings.

On Stage, Children, Erva Loomis
Merow. Carlton Press, 84 Fifth Aven-
ue, New York 10011. Pp. 130. $3.50.

ACOLLECTION of twenty-one original,
unpretentious little one-act (and
short one-act) plays for elementary-
school-age children is based on child-
hood experiences and simple home or
school situations, in both the past and
the present. None has any element of
the stunt, or skit, but each is dramatic
enough to please the child taking part.
For example, one of them involves the
packing of a trunk to take with a family
emigrating to America on the May-
flower. What would you take to an un-
known, unsettled land?

Another tells of the excitement of
waiting for the school bus; another in-
volves the thrill of being selected as
pitcher on the team. Others are based
on Halloween, Christmas, Mother’s
Day. and other occasions dear to chil-
dren’s hearts. They may lack Broad-
way impact—but child impact is there!

RUN, don’t walk, to the nearest post-
ofiice, because here is a real bar-
gain, as anyone who looks over pub-
lishers’ price lists will note. It’s spiral-
bound, game-to-a-page, each game well
illustrated by stick figures showing the
formation needed. Each game write-up
is organized under equipment needed,
value and skills, procedure, type (quiet,
active, relay, et cetera), and the grades
most suitable, such as kindergarten
through third-grade, third through
sixth, and grades seven and eight. The
contents page serves also as a classified
index, since the page number for each
game is given under the game classifi-
cation. A useful and novel feature is a
special section on fitness tests.

Playground leaders, or anyone work-
ing with the five- to fourteen-year-olds,
will find it just as helpful as the class-
room teacher.

0 SNOW JOB. “Push and shovel” backbreaking snow removal
can be eliminated with four new “heart saver” snowthrowers.
Each model is a dual stage heavy-duty type with the com-
bined action of an auger for crushing and delivering snow
to the powerful ejector fan which can throw snow as far
as forty feet. A remote controlled 210° directional chute On
each model permits the ejected snow to be thrown where
desired. In 20-, 24-, 28- and 36-inch widths, the new “Klon-
dikes” will throw snow at the rate of 300 to 350 shovels per
minute or between 18 and 22 tons per hour.

All controls are grouped in a “dashboard” extending be-
tween the drive handles. This provides finger tip control
for throttle, remote chute control, snow selector lever, and
drive control lever. A safety key, which must be turned to
start the motor, is included on the 28- and 36-inch models.

With this control grouping plus the overall design, the
operator has an unobstructed view in front of the auger.
All gear housings and drive assemblies are completely en-
closed to insure safety and prevent damage caused by snow
or foreign objects.

The entire front end assembly, including auger, ejection
Ian, and chute may be separated from the power and con-
trol section by removing two thumb screws. This facilitates
storage and permits the use of additional attachments which
are connected to the power control section. One new attach-
ment is an outdoor vacuum cleaner. Tire chains and drift
cutter bars are available as accessories. Inquiries should be
addressed to Lambert Incorporated, Dayton, Ohio 45404.

0 WHAT WASHED UP ON THE BEACH? How to keep beaches
from debris and pollution is a growing problem for munici-
palities and resort areas. A unit has been successfully de-
signed that lifts debris-laden sand and scours six feet swaths
to a six inch depth. Resembling a steel wagon with the front
wheels removed, it is towed behind a tractor. The debris is
scooped up by a paddle wheel, moves along the 271/2-foot
conveyor apron of reinforced spiral-weave wire. Clean sand
filters back to the beach; debris is deposited in a two-ton
capacity receptacle. Trademarked the Beach Sanitizer, it
has been tested in several areas and found helpful in beach
maintenance. For further information write to Allis-Chal-
mers, Milwaukee 1, Wisconsin.

0 POP GOES THE POPCORN! The 1965 model of the popular
Whiz Bang popcorn machine has been redesigned inside to
include sixteen hundred more cubic inches of working space.
The new feature provides greater operating convenience and
storage space. The exterior takes on a “new look” having
a bright-yellow illuminated dome with the word POPCORN
on it. For safety, the Whiz Bang has an enclosed motor.
This also adds to its appearance. Available in eithcr counter
or floor models. For further information, write to Gold
Medal Products, 1825 Freeman Avenue, Cincinnati.

0 BY THE BUCKETFUL. A new crawler-mounted hydraulic

excavator, the Poclain TC-45, can be equipped with any
of more than thirty different attachments, including clam-
shell buckets, loaders, backhoes, grapples, ditch-cleaning
buckets, backfill blade, ripper, and others. All attachments
use the same machine boom and can be changed from one
to another within twenty minutes. A special ditching at-
tachment provides a reach of twenty-five feet for drainage
work in swamps, marshy areas, et cetera. Each of the
tractor-type tracks on the TC-45 is powered by an independ-
enlty operated hydraulic motor, driven by the master piston-
type hydraulic pump. Three track widths are available with
pads twenty, twenty-eight, and thirty-six inches wide to pro-
vide respective ground pressure of 5.1, 3.9, and 2.7 PSI for
use on soft terrain. A ground clearance of sixteen inches

permits work in rough, rocky areas. The Poclain TC-45
features an air-cooled diesel engine, continuous 360—degree
rotation, and a high-pressure hydraulic system (3500 to
4000 PSI) for simplified maintenance and low parts-replace-
ment costs. Complete specifications, literature, and prices
are available from American Poclain Corporation, 815 Mar-
tin Street, Rahway, New Jersey.

0 SAFE GOING. Special ice-melting crystals take the danger
out of winter walking, prevent accidents, and traffic tie-ups.
Called Melt—Aid, the crystals virtually do away with snow
shoveling. M elt-Aid’s exothermic action liquidizes snow and
ice instantly, on contact. Melt-Aid also prevents refreezing.
Just one sprinkle keeps driveways, sidewalks, yards and
parking lots free of snow and ice. For literature, sizes and
prices, write to the manufacturer: Coastal Chemical Corpo-
ration, Garfield, New Jersey.

0 WATCH THE FLAGS co BY! Who doesn’t love a parade
with unfurling flags, a decorated Main Street, or custom
flags and banners around the old bandstand. Where to find
the appurtenances? Flags, banners, poles and pole orna-
ments, holders, lawn sets, schoolroom sets, sidewalk displays,
parade lead banners, state flags, miniature flags, UN flags,
boating flags, drapery, and religious flags are all available
from largc manufacturer. An eight-page colorful descriptive
folder is available by writing to Annin and Company, 85

AUDIO-VlSUAl

Sound barrier. Entitled Nothing But Noise, 0
well-illustrated 24-page book clearly describes
the problems and their solutions of radio fre-
quency interference on mobile rigs. Written in
an easy-to-understand question-and-answer
style, the book thor0ughly discusses the sources
of engine electrical noise, as well as pulse noises
and their elimination through the use of suppres-
sion kits, filtering, and complete shielded igni-
tion systems with particular attention to the au-
tomotive and marine fields. A must for anyone
using, selling or servicing mobile communica-
tions, this unusually informative book is free for
the asking. Write to Hallett Manufacturing
Company, 5910 Bowcroft Street, los Angeles
90016.

Mobile sound. A 32-watt all-transistor mobile
amplifier plugs directly into automobile cigar-
ette lighter sockets for a convenient power
source for use in cars, boats, planes, trains,
sightseeing buses, saund trucks, and mobile
units. The amplifier can be adapted for flash-
light “D” battery operation or for plug-in to
any electric outlet (117 VAC). literature is
available from the Perma-Pawer Company, 5740
North Tripp Avenue, Chicago 60646.

BUILDING AND MAINTENANiE

Rail test. Vinyl handrail—much in evidence at
the New York World's Fair—is being tested at
the seal pool in New York City's Central Park
Zoo. One 25-foot side of the railing surround-
ing the seal pool was capped with black Ruco-
rail over one year ago and has held up remark-
ably well. Uncapped railing has to be repainted
from time to time because the constant applica-
tion of hands wears the paint away. The vinyl
handrail is also resistant to chipping, from peo-
ple's rings. For further information, write to
Rubber Corporation of America, Hicksville, New

York.

Button, button. A new type of permanent pave-
ment marker for parking is a button, three and
a half inches in diameter and three-eighths of
an inch high, designed for parking areas, wher-
ever permanent marking is needed. Available
with a smooth finish, or with glass beads for
nighttime reflectivity. The buttons are glued
down with a two-compound epoxy adhesive; no
nails or spikes are needed. Markers of this
same material, with this same adhesive, have
withstood many years' service on busy freeways
with0ut loss or damage. For further information,
write to Baits-line, Inc., 2431 Spring Street,
Redwood City, California.

Safe crossing. Ali-steel pedestrian foot bridges,
available in lengths of thirty to sixty feet or
more, are prefabricated into a small number of
standard assemblies which can be bolted to-
gether on the erection site. Originally can-

ceived as an inexpensive solution of school-
crossing safety problems, the new bridge can
serve botanical gardens, parks, stadiums or
wherever similar highway or street crossing
problems exist. For further information write to
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company, Neville
Island, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15225.

PROGRAM AIDS

Tennis tips. Both players and teachers will find
many valuable hints for improving their game
in a new 24-page booklet, How to Teach Tennis
with Ball-Boy, by tennis authority Judy Barta.
Mrs. Barta shows clearly how many of the basic
theories over the years are outdated. Simplified
diagrams, specific methods, and many shortcuts
are included in a compact presentation. The
booklet is offered free of charge to profession-
ais, coaches, teachers, and students of the
game. For your coPY. write to the Bail-Boy
Company, 27 Milburn Street, Branxville, New
York.

A holiday message. A complete line of posters,
booklets, and other materials to promote fire
safety at Christmas is now available from the
National Fire Protection Association. The ways
we celebrate the yuletide—with trees, wreaths,
colored lights, hanging decorations—mean ex-
tra fire hazards and the need for special pre-
cautionary measures. The booklet, A Holiday
Message to You describes in detail the safe
handling of Christmas trees, precautions about
lights and decorations, the disposal of wrap-
pings, and even the selection of toys. For som-
pies and quantity prices on these materials,
write the Public Relations Department, National
Fire Protection Association, 60 Batterymarch
Street, Boston 021 10.

Swing along. A specially constructed frame for
gymnastic rings which eliminates the need for
overhead rigging weighs only 150 paunds, is
easy to assemble and erect and can be used
wherever horizontal bar floor plates are avail-
able. Nan-marking pads protect the gym fioor.
For further information write The Gymnastic Sup-
ply Company, Inc., 247 West Sixth Street, San

With stone and broom. The ever-growing num-
ber of artificial ice rinks have developed a new
interest in the ancient game of curling among
sports-loving Americans. A new bulletin, Steel

of curling frOm its origin in Scotlond during the
sixteen century down to present time. To oid
clubs, schools, commercial rink owners, ond sim-
ilar groups to evaluate curling for their own

feet ond, probably even more, public policy to
to preserve vegetotion hove been altering the
scene ever since settlers took over the valley
from the Indians in the eorly 1850's.

Changes ore continuing now ot such 0 rote
that, in the opinion of two University of Cali-
fornio forest reseorchers, decisions ore going
to be needed soon to determine what the Yo-
semite landscape should be.

In a newly published manual of the univer-
sity‘s Division of Agricultural Sciences, foresters
Robert P. Gibbons and Horold F. Heady present
0 study of Yosemite tree growth ond other veg-
etation, including controsting photographs
taken almost one hundred years apart in time.
Trees, mainly pines ond cedors, have encroached
steadily on the valley's open meadows, grown
up to screen vistos, ond formed thickets that
pose a constant threat of disastrous fire. "To-
day," the forestry reseorchers declare, "ecologi-
col knowledge enobles us to predict vegetation
changes under vorious kinds of management
and we olso have the technical obility to pro-
duce almost ony desired Iondscape. But, un-
hoppily, the aesthetic criteria for making deci-

R FOR THE ILL 63 HANDICAPPED

 

+ Telephone employe volunteers have
sixty-five service chapters with a total
membership of 226,080 in the United
States, reports The Telephone Pioneer.
In 1963, seventeen thousand volunteers
were active in Pioneer-sponsored com-
munity service projects. One out of
every three of the pioneers is engaged
in assistance to the visually handicapped
and he does this in a variety of ways.
Some 2,394 volunteers in fifty-two
chapters spend their leisure hours re-
pairing talking-book machines for the
blind. Today, there are 108 volunteers
in eleven chapters engaged in recording
talking books, and 37,879 records, in-
cluding tape recordings, have been pro-
vided for the blind so far. Many of these
are text books for students from ele-
mentary through college levels. In
fourteen chapters, 163 braillists, certi-
fied for proficiency by the Library of
Congress, are making it possible for
some blind boy or girl to receive a
good education. They have brailled
over two hundred different textbooks
in the school curriculum.

Pioneer projects include many other
services for the blind, such as an eye
bank program, clothing collection, fund
raising, hospital work, and the develop-
ment of handicapped aids.

+ News of international developments
in the field of the ill and handicapped
comes from John A. Nesbitt, deputy
general of the International Recreation
Association :

0 The Swedish government sponsors
performances by concert orchestras and
theater groups for patients in general
hospitals. A special radio station with
a full-time director broadcasts to all
treatment centers in metropolitan
Stockholm.

0 A unique feature of recreation for
the handicapped in Japan is the inclu-
sion of “painting” in 150 psychiatric
hospitals.

0 The staff at Beckomberga organized
a month-long holiday at an Italian sea-
side resort for forty-nine patients.

0 In The Hague, Netherlands, evening
schools and recreation clubs for adoles-
cent and adult retarded persons are an
on-going part of the city’s comprehen-
sive community programs. Throughout
the Netherlands the social pedagogue,

DR. THOMPSON is director of the Na-
tional Recreation Association’s Con-
sulting Service on Recreation for the Ill

and Handicapped.

DECEMBER, 1964

Morton Thompson, Ed.D.

or after-care worker, plays a key role
by assuming long-term reSponsibility
for retarded persons. He guides the
retarded person in his community ad-
justment including recreation and lei-
sure-time activities.

0 In England, day centers serve non-
ambulatory elderly persons and provide
transportation between the home and
center once or twice a week.

0 The National Association of Crippled
in Denmark is typical of many organ-
izations throughout the world provid-
ing services for members. Its program
includes leisure-time clubs, a sports
branch, organized tours, dances, and
theater parties. The association has a
country estate for vacations and holi-
days.

+ The third annual volume on Recrea-
tion in Treatment Centers, published by
the American Recreation Society, is a
collection of papers on the professional
practice of recreation for the ill and
handicapped. Papers this year have

been written by Eunice Kennedy

Shriver, Luther W. Stringham, John L.
Hutchinson, Charles F. Weckworth, and
John A. Nesbitt. In addition, there are

thirteen other articles written by out-
standing professionals in the allied
fields of recreation for the handicapped.
This publication can be purchased for
$2.50 from the American Recreation
Society, 1404 New York Avenue, Wash-
ington, D.C., 20005.

4* Entries in the fifth annual Graduate
Rehabilitation Literary Awards com-

+ The world’s best planned rehabilita-
tion center will admit its first patients
in January 1965. The staff of the new
center in Lisbon, Portugal, has been
training for its work for one to four
years prior to the Opening of the center,
writes Dr. Howard A. Rush in The
New Y orh Times of September 20. The
new center includes an area for outdoor
therapy which is usable the year round
in the mild climate of Portugal.

 

Bike Pike

Continued from Page 495

 

Two new neighborhood parks were
dedicated last spring and land has been
acquired for several others.

At present, Bike Pike has proven to
be one of the most popular features of
Alverthorpe Park. Many adults, as
well as children, regularly use it, and
entire families on wheels are a familiar
sight. Prior to its opening, school chil-
dren in Abington Township were in-
vited to submit names for the new bi-
cycle trail. Nancy Otis suggested the
winning “Bike Pike” and received a
new bicycle from Mr. Rosenwald and
the honor of riding through a ribbon
to officially open the trail at its dedica-
tion. Several runner-ups in the contest
also received gifts from Mr. Rosenwald.

As an additional feature of the dedi-
cation of Bike Pike, a cycle bike was

held from Abington Senior High School
in the center of the township to the park
about four miles away. Under the direc-
tion of Fred DeLong, a director of the
Philadelphia Chapter of the American
Youth Hostel, and Rich Norman, local
bicycle-shop pr0prietor, a hundred cy-
