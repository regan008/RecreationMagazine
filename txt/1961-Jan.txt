You can hardly buy a new tie for a
vacation wardrobe with 63¢. But
thousands of people pay for a whole
trip by putting something into U. S.
Savings Bonds every pay day. Just
63¢ a day adds up to $18.75 a month,
‘  . -« . _  enough to buy a $25 Savings Bond.

have saved for that dream trip with
pocket change you might have drib-
bled away. Why not start saving for
your first vacation Bond today?

 

Money with your name on it. Savings
Bonds can be turned into cash any-
time. Yet you can’t lose your money.
Your Bonds are registered in your name

6‘ OUTH IN THE US. Lugs in Test of Fitness,” reads
a headline in The New Y orlc Times, December 7,

1960. Just what significance has this statement
for youth leaders, for recreation, and for the nation, as we
plan ahead for another year?

Fitness has been a concern of the human race since the

days of primitive man—primarily because it is necessary
to survival and security. In ancient Rome and Greece, the
warriors tested,themselves at games and the winners were
crowned with laurel wreaths. As the Roman Empire be-
came surfeited with rich living, the young men grew soft,
national health suffered, the empire declined and fell.

In 1877, Benjamin Disraeli said, “The health of the peo-
ple is really the foundation upon which all their happiness
and their powers as a state depend.” History, as we have
learned, repeats itself—and therefore drives home the im-
portance of our concern for the fitness of modern American
youth. After two world wars have been won, self-confidence
and a feeling of superiority are responsible for a letdown.
Also, mass production and technical advances are proving
to be devices not only for good but for degeneration. Labor-
saving devices can finally result in inertia and a moral as
well as a muscular flabbiness. It becomes too easy to “let
George do it.” Parents and leaders are becoming only too
familiar with the sight of children sitting passively, watch-
ing others play or entertain, unwilling to participate.

Americans tend to “protect” their children from exercise,
according to George K. Makechnie, dean of Boston Uni-
versity. “In an urban society,” he says, when the child
“reaches the creeping stage he is caged in a living room
playpen. When he has learned to walk he is placed in a
stroller. When he reaches school age he is transported to
and from school in the family car or the school bus.. At
home he Hops before the television set. Little wonder that
his head and shoulders begin to droop, his chest flattens,
and his stomach protrudes!”

The dean adds that, of course, there are exceptions,
“There is still the minority who, by natural drive and na-
ural skills, can ‘make the team.’ But, here again, there is
anger, that the child with athletic skills will be exploited,
hat ‘winning’ the game will be more important than ‘play-
'ng’ the game.”

Have our countrymen lost sight of the fact that they are
raining the future citizens of a country which must play
n important role in world leadership? That our children
re forming life-long attitudes and habits now? That, for
instance, a new deficiency in children has been described in
the journal of the. American Medical Association as “tele-
vision legs,” a weakness of the lower extremities interfering

ith the ability to run or walk properly?

IANUARY 1961

fore it is too late. . . .

Fitness . . . What Significance?

In 1959, eleven faculty members of Boston University’s
Sargent College, one of the nation’s oldest schools of physi-
cal education and physical therapy, participated in a written
symposium on “Do Americans Have Sufficient Health and
Energy in This Modern Era?” Dean Makechnie pointed
out that in 1958, in Parris Island, South Carolina, forty-
three percent of the young recruits for the Marine Corps
were classified as “in poor condition,” and initially “seventy
percent cannot pass the Marine Corps test for minimum
physical ability and fitness.”

As Dr. Henry J. Bakst, professor of preventive medicine,
pointed out in the same symposium, “. . . It has become
apparent that neither health nor disease is the product-of? -'~
an isolated cause and effect relationship but rather the re-

sult of a variety of factors associated with heredity, custom,
emotional adjustment, social organization, and environ-

ment.” And he goes on to say that any effort to deaf-with 
these multiple factors must be made by professional per-

sonnel trained to deal with the problems involved. .

The recent Times article reports that, in terms of overall

physical fitness, United States boys and girls are still soft,
“weaker than the youth of other nations,” according to a
comparison just released by the American Association of
Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. The associa-
tion compared our young people with those of England,
Scotland, Wales, and Cyprus. The findings are shocking.
The comparison revealed, for instance, that in the test for
“endurance for sustained activity” British girls in the ten-
to-eleven age bracket exceeded the average scores made by
US. boys. In “leg power,” the girls of ten, eleven, twelve,
and thirteen outscored U.S. boys of the same age. (It would
be interesting to have the boys in one of our communities
featuring a strong fitness program take one of these tests.

Would they do better?)

Seven different tests were given to both boys and girls

in the ten-to-seventeen age bracket. British girls scored
ahead of United States girls in all seven, and British boys
finished ahead of US. boys in six. The lone United States

victory was in “arm power” for boys.

The report says, “These comparisons cannot be lightly

regarded or glossed over easily. They should provoke seri-
ous thought and stimulate universal, organized action be-

9.“

Need we ask, then, where recreation—and all youth lead-

ership—fits into this picture? The challenge is clear. Civic
responsibility in each and every community must result in
the cooperation and coordination of every leader and every
agency to the end that we do not fail our youth. our country.

our future.

Part-Time Employees

In the November 1960 issue of REC-
REATION, Joseph E. Curtis discussed
agreement forms for part-time person—
nel to expedite employment, adminis-
tration, and dismissal. These forms
filled a long-felt need in recreation ad-
ministration, according to the numer-
ous letters and inquiries received by
Mr. Curtis in recent weeks. The follow-
ing are excerpts from a few of these
letters:

Sirs:
, Your good wishes [on the Camp Fire

those of the National Recreation Asso-

cially because of the closeness of our
ties, dating back to the origin of both
organizations.

As [Mr. Prendergast] so aptly said,
“Since our roots have been planted in
the same earth, and nurtured by the
same gardeners, it is no wonder that
'our two agencies have always enjoyed
the best of cooperation, mutual respect
and affection for each other.” It is with
great pleasure that we anticipate future
years working closely with you, carry-
ing forward our aims and ideals for the
best preparation of the youth of the
nation.

Small Town Recreation
irs:

North Riverside, Illinois, is a small
town with a population of 7,100. We
have no playgrounds or parks, yet pro-
vide a well-rounded recreation program
for the people and their children. We
utilize our Forest Preserve area in the
summer by offering nature study and
hiking trips, badminton, tetherball and

oftball for boys and girls.

The Riverside-Brookfield High School
in our vicinity provided us with a learn-
to-swim program in which 260 young-
sters from eight to sixteen took an
ctive part. Recreation swimming was
offered at 3 Forest Preserve pool on a
once-a-week basis. We chartered buses

nd the recreation commission paid
part of the fee, the participating chil-
ren paying the other half.

We have formed a junior-youth coun-

i1 and the teenagers do all the planning
for programs and activities under guid-
nce. We hold teen dances once a month,
at our village hall, which is rather small,
but our school does not permit dances
on Saturday night. We transport our

hildren by bus to go roller skating and
indoor ice skating.

In winter we have the school gymna-

also offer reduced-rate educational trips
out of the state for children from the
upper grades and their parents. Last
year we toured our nation’s capital.
We had thirty-one enrolled for this trip,
plus five adults.

For the Fourth of July, we get to-
gether with other civic organizations of
the village to put on a full day of ac-
tivities, ending with a $500 firework
display in the evening. Most of the
money is made in the concession booth.
During our eight-week summer pro-
gram, we set Wednesdays aside for

field trips.

This is a terrible thing. It drains a
city of its most responsible elements;
it saps its intellectual Vitality. It robs
the city of the very reasons for its exist-
ence. “The very rich, the very poor,
and the slightly odd” are not a proper
mixture for an urban metropolis, as we
in New York are finding out at bitter
cost. Into the vacuum left by the mid-
dle class come the dregs of humanity,
which has created a huge crime prob-
lem in every big city in America and a
huge narcotics problem on top of its
other crime in New York City.

I’m looking at the zoning resolution
issued by those lunkheads on the New
York City Planning Commission. One
of the aims: “To recognize the fact that
the automobile is here to stay.” Now,
if we’re going to use platitudes, I can
think of a better one: People are here
to stay.

People are the forgotten element in
all city planning—at least, American
city planning. Instead, come rights of
realtors, the rights of the automobile,
the prosperity of the merchants, the
speeding of crosstown traHic, access to

avarice of the realtors.

like most.—From Your Home, Bos-

New Y ork Herald Tribune, November
14 and 16, 1960.

 

 

} A NEW ORGANIZATION, Comeback,
Inc., has been established as a national
society for the social rehabilitation of
the ill and handicapped. It anticipates
the inauguration of its own service pro-
gram as of July 1, 1961. Mrs. Beatrice
H. Hill resigned from the staff of the
National Recreation Association on De-
cember 14, 1960 to become the execu-
tive director of Comeback, Inc.

Since 1953, through its Consulting
Service on Recreation for the Ill and
Handicapped, directed by Mrs. Hill, the
National Recreation Association has
fostered the concept of recreation as a
major force in the comprehensive social
rehabilitation of ill and handicapped

persons.

In these eight years, there has been
a phenomenal increase in a nationwide
recognition and acceptance of this gen-
cral concept, as well as a corresponding
increase in demands on the Association
fOr consulting services on recreation for

the ill and handicapped.

The National Recreation Association
and Comeback, Inc., will be completely
separate and autonomous organizations
with independent offices, boards of di-
rectors, professional and administra-
tive staffs, finances, and services, but
they will coordinate their respective
services so that duplication and con-
flict will be avoided so far as possible
and the field best be served. Comeback,
Inc., will be a Service Affiliate of the
National Recreation Association.

The National Recreation Association
is continuing its services for the ill and
the handicapped. Until the completion
of two special projects, financed by the
government, Dr. Morton Thompson is
temporarily in charge. Mrs. Hill will
serve as consultant for these projects.

In accepting Mrs. Hill’s resignation,
Joseph Prendergast, executive director
of the National Recreation Association,
said: “As director of the Association’s
Consulting Service on Recreation for
the Ill and Handicapped, you have
greatly expanded and strengthened the
Association’s work in this area. I know
your experience and enthusiasm will en-
able Comeback tO achieve important
goals in the field of social rehabilita-
tion. In our capacity as a service
agency to all those organizations and in-
dividuals concerned with recreation we
look forward to cooperation with you

and Comeback as with all others who
believe in the importance of creative
recreation for all our people in sickness

> PHYSICAL FITNESS is the subject of a
beautifully illustrated article “The Soft
American,” by President-elect John F.
Kennedy, in the December 26, 1960 is-
sue of Sports Illustrated. (See also edi-
torial in this issue, Page 5. ) Jack Ken-
nedy has found that fitness pays Off and
he practices what he preaches. He says,
“No matter how vigorous the leader-
ship of government, we can fully restore
the physical soundness of our nation
only if every American is willing to as-

sume responsibility for his own fitness
and the fitness of his children.”

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNO‘V
1 The centennial of the Civil War will

be observed in many communities
through the next four years. The battles
and events of the War Between the
States will be the theme of many festi-
vals and pageants.

’ NO “ersatz” has yet been found that
will adequately take the place of a live
performance, according to an article on
“Bringing the Living Arts to School,”
in the December issue of Parents’ Mag-
azine. The parents in Ossining, New
York, fully aware of this fact, give an
account of how they are helping to bring
the living arts to school. This is a re-
port based on eXperience and the prac-
tical difficulties and solutions thereto
are fully described. The result is a
definite plan which can be adapted and
put into effect in almost any school sit-
uation where live performances are
lacking and where parents desire to
meet this need.

F SEVENTY ADDITIONAL SITES have been
declared eligible for Registered Na-
tional Historic Landmark status, Secre-
tary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton has
just announced. The sites possessing
exceptional historic and archeological
values are among 111 described in six
new “theme studies” in the National
Park Service series covering all the
major periods of human history in Am-
erica. The six studies are: “Political

and Military Affairs, 1783-1830,” “The
Civil War, 1861-1865,” and four sub-
themes, under “W’estward Expansion
and Extension of the National Bound-
aries,” entitled “The Santa Fe Trail,”
“The Cattlemen’s Empire,” “Military
and Indian Affairs,” and “The Texas
Revolutions and the War with Mexico.

1820-1853.”

b ON THE CULTURE FRONT, did you
know that:

' One person in six in the United States
plays a musical instrument, and there
are more than fifteen hundred com-
munity orchestras?

° Ten million attend dance perform-
ances?

' Two major dance festivals are held
annually in the United States, climaxing
the season for numerous civic ballet
groups?

° In 1959 the largest exhibition Of art
ever held in the United States attracted
fifty-six thousand persons tO the New

York City Coliseum?

) A collection of 114 Of the finest ex-
amples Of American crafts in silver,
ceramics, fabrics, and tableware is now
being exhibited around the country.
The exhibition is the result Of a nation-
wide design competition sponsored by
the American Craftsmen’s Council, in
which over eleven hundred craftsmen
entered their work. Here are dates and
places where the exhibit will be seen:

Jan. 6-29: Fine Art Gallery, San

F A NEW TEACHING MACHINE, the Mark
II AutoTutor, has just been demon-
strated in New York by U. S. Industries,
Inc. Developed by its Western Design
Electronics Division, it is one more
evidence Of the age of automation. The
student sits before a small screen and
pushbuttons his lesson—proceeding at
his Own pace. This eliminates group
teaching and, to a large extent, the
human teacher. The machine asks
questions, the student answers them,
on a keyboard, and the machine keeps
a record of his mistakes, time involved,
and so on. Allied with this new venture
is one of America’s largest book pub-
lishers, Doubleday and Company, New
York. This firm is experimenting with
self-teaching books called TutorTexts.
The first titles, among them Goren’s
Elements to Bridge and Introduction to
Electronics, are causing excitement in
bookstore circles. The books follow the
same teaching techniques but cannot
keep track of the student progress.

The University of Illinois has ac-
quired the AutoTutor Mark I, a more
expensive model for use in its training
research laboratory. Just what such a
machine can mean tO leisure-time pur-
suits, especially recreation interests,
has not as yet been determined. But it
will be worth watching—one of the
demonstration machines can teach one
to play golf.

} LEISURE is big business. Personal ex-
penditures for “so-called leisure activi-
ties have risen by approximately sixty
percent during the past decade and are
currently estimated to amount to over
$40,000,000,000 per annum, roughly
equivalent tO those for national de-
fense,” according to a weekly bulletin on
stocks issued by the First of Michigan
Corporation. The bulletin attributes
this remarkable rise to “to the increase
in population, broader distribution of

wealth, shifts to the suburbs, techno-
logical improvements, increased use of
credit, and more leisure time. . . . The I
trend towards more active participation
in recreation and hobbies, so strong in I
recent years, seems likely to continue. .
. . . Industries which have been [soar- "
ing] include boating, bowling, ‘dO-it-
yourself’ products, auto rentals, photog-
raphy, and trave .”

} THE ROLE OF ORGANIZED LABOR in
leisure-time activities is being studied
by a subcommittee of the National Ad-
visory Council of the AFL-CIO Com- '
munity Service Committee. Members
Of the study committee are Olga Madar,
recreation director Of the United Auto- I
mobile Workers (see Page 39 ); Ernest I
F. Witte, executive director of the Coun- {
cil on Social Work Education; and Jo-
seph Prendergast, executive director of l
the National Recreation Association.

 

) MORE BOND ISSUES and amendments
passed in the November elections:

' In Ohio, the Cuyahoga Falls Park
and Recreation Department will receive
$100,000 annually for the next five
years for capital expenditures as the re-
sult of a one-mill park improvement
levy approved by the voters. The new
tax will cost the average home owner
approximately five dollars per year.
Fifty-two percent of the city’s existing
park areas are undevelOped.

° Milton-Freewater, Oregon, approved
a $175,000 bond issue for park develop-

ment and construction of a swimming

pool by a vote Of 557 to 331.

° Tucson, Arizona, passed a $800,000
bond issue for two swimming pools and

ark development. The city also com-
hined its park and recreation depart-
ments. Previously the recreation de-
partment has been reporting directly to
the city manager and the parks depart-
ment had been under public works.
Now the parks and recreation depart-
ment will report directly to the city
manager.

' California voters supported over-
whelmingly a constitutional amendment
that makes nonprofit golf courses sub-
ject to taxes as golf courses rather than
highest possible land use. The proposi-
tion, as it appeared on the ballot, read:
“In assessing real property consisting A
Of one parcel of ten acres or more and 
used exclusively for nonpront golf
course purposes for at least two succes-
sive years prior to the assessment, the
assessor shall consider no factors other
than those relative to such use. He may,
however, take into consideration the
existence Of any mines, minerals, and J
quarries in the property, including, but f
not limited to Oil, gas, and other hydro-
carbon substances.” #

RECREATION

 

HE PROPER AND effective role of
T recreation in the lives of our
rapidly expanding “over sixty-
five” population is a concept so new that
it is still in the process of discovery and
eager scrutiny. Working with older
people in nursing homes, hospitals, or
residences is one of the most exciting
activities of our time. Geriatrics is a
new frontier and a pioneer group of
recreation workers is engaged in explor-
ing and developing unmapped terri-
tories of human life. They are fighting
boredom, loneliness, and depression in
the lives of our elderly citizens.

Recreation is hardly an atomic-age
discovery. To a child, playing comes as
naturally as breathing. It has always
been thus; but the fact that a child
learns through play, that play is a basic
requisite for his healthy growth and de-
ve10pment, is a relatively recent con-
cept. However, in relation to the elderly,
recreation has the newness of rockets
and missiles.

We, as a society, pretended for a time
not to notice that the “golden years”
medical science had almost miraculous-
ly added to human existence were so
darkly tarnished that the term was a
mockery. Today, we are indeed notic-

ing; how can we lightly dismiss the

plight of a segment of population that
numbers sixteen million and is growing
larger every day?

What are senior residents or patients
doing? Are they engaged in some spe-
cial activity that they find interesting,
stimulating, pleasant? Are they having
fun? Or . . . are they silently sitting,
staring into Space, eyes dimmed by the
realization that they have been dis-
carded and forgotten, mental percep-
tion dulled by indifference to the pres-
ent and fear of the future, physical
energy drained by inactivity and pro-
longed boredom? Is it possible to
transform them into a houseful of fac-
similes of Grandma Moses, Herbert
Hoover, and Eleanor Roosevelt? There
was a time when this would have been
the wildest kind of wishful thinking.
Today, it is sensible and practical to try.

The secret of Grandma Moses, Mrs.
Roosevelt, Mr. Hoover, and anyone else
who is in good health, active, and happy
in their later years, is not a secret any
more. They are peOple who have con-
tinued to be active, making only the
necessary concessions to age; they have
maintained a keen interest in other
people and in the world about them long
past their sixty-fifth birthday. Their
activity and genuine interest must have
kept them healthy physically and young
mentally; they have a continuing sense
of achievement and fulfillment which
has prevented them from becoming
ghosts that wander the no-man’s-land
between life and death.

THE SAME
OLD STORY

A new frontier for the aging

Carol Lucas, Ed.D.

XPERIENCE HAS revealed that recrea-
tion, skillfully adapted to the indi-
vidual’s needs, achieves similar results.
For many, recreation revives and stimu-
lates the competitive spirit they thought
long dead. They find that such a simple
thing as winning a game can erase
aches and pains they believed chronic.
It can put a sparkle in the eye, a lilt in
the voice, a bounce in the step. A gentle-
man of seventy-eight, retired and living
in Florida, still plays golf regularly. He
telephones his daughter in Michigan
every week and, even at that distance,
she can tell by his voice when he had a
good game and beaten a man younger
than himself. His enjoyment of the
game has not changed a whit over the
years.

For others, recreation means com-
panionship. It serves as a backdrop for
the development of friendships. A built-
in benefit of recreation is socialization,
without which older people tend to draw
within themselves and become more
and more intent upon their ailments.
Without the warmth and stimulation
and security of human companionship,
confidence diminishes and incentive
dies.

Recreation may be defined as the ex-
perience chosen by the individual be-
cause he wants to participate. he wants
to have fun and exhilaration. By this
definition, recreation is an enriclnnent
of living rather than an escaln‘ from

RECREATION

KEEP
UP-
T0-
DATE!

: ECREATION AND PARK administrators keep up-to-date
R by attending professional conferences—a mark of
leadership growth and more competent service. A
leader who does not constantly strive to improve his skills
and services is guilty of an unprofessional attitude. F ol-
lowing the recent 4I2nd National Recreation Congress, the
' executives of the municipal recreation departments in Aus-
tin, Texas, and Brockton, Massachusetts, shared with their
local officials and other community leaders pertinent infor-
mation they had obtained at the Congress sessions, which
had important implications for the improvement of the pub-
I lie recreation programs in their communities. The follow-
ing statements are from their reports:

In Sharper Focus

Beverly Sheffield, director of recreation in Austin, stated,
“The privilege of attending the 42nd National Recreation
Congress in Washington, D.C., was greatly appreciated.
Such a meeting tends to sharpen one’s focus on the objective
of municipal recreation; it stimulates one’s imagination on
new programs and developments; it broadens one’s philoso-
phy on Why Recreation, and it enlarges one’s understand-
ing of the social significance of leisure. The total result is
a great challenge to develop a better recreation system for
the city of Austin. .

“Following are a few concepts, ideas, and bits of infor-
mation which I harvested from my experience:

“Across the nation, city after city is experiencing an en-
croachment of recreation, parklands, and waters . . . for the
development of highways, commercial and industrial devel-
opments, public schools, and varied public usage. With the
ever-enlarging population, this loss of parklands for our
future generations presents a serious problem. Many cities
have set up plans to acquire parkland from subdividers. Los
Angeles is working on a plan to charge a Special fee with
each building permit which will be used for the purchasing
of parkland in a given area. .

“The final outcome of our American culture is said to
hinge on how we learn to use our leisure. It is an obvious
fact that man does what he knows how to do and too few
venture into new interests. Hence, it is important to give
young people an experience in many activities, both physi-
cal and cultural, to broaden their taste. . . .

New Ideas
“One city is finding greater use and respect for its park

JANUARY 1961

picnic tables by painting them red, blue, yellow, etcetera.
We [Austin] will consider experimenting with this practice.
Another city takes used lightpoles and rips off slabs from
two sides to use for barricades in parks. The middle part
of the pole is ripped into lumber used in replacing wornout
seat planks, etcetera. One large park system has developed
a portable shed which is moved out on the job site for the
protection of its bulldozer at night. This shed costs approxi-
mately $1,800, but is considered well worth the expense. . . .

“The Washington, D.C. Recreation Department has an
excellent series of slides depicting the organization and op-
eration of the department. Here is a good idea for us to
follow. I spent several hours at the DC department dis-
cussing its system of hiring ‘roving leaders’ as a direct
means to combat delinquency. In brief, these ‘roving
leaders’ operate from the street corner where they meet
natural groups. They win the approval of the group and
gradually influence the group to participate in wholesome
recreation activities. This has been a successful operation
and is a technique which we might study for use in
Austin. . . .

“You will remember that Life magazine had a series of
articles on ‘The National Purpose.’ The editors wrote the
National Recreation Association asking for its reaction to
articles. The result is a comprehensive, two-year project
involving discussion of our ‘National Purpose’ by represent-
ative groups in our nation, a further exploration of our
‘purpose.’ The NRA is directing the project with a grant
from Life. . . .

“I was pleased that George Lowrey, assistant director of
our department, in charge of program, was permitted to at-
tend the Congress. He is just as enthusiastic over his experi-
ence and as appreciative of the opportunity as I am.”

New Grafts

“It is time” wrote Paul C. Cowles, superintendent of rec-
reation in Brockton, upon his return from the Congress.
“to chop off some of these dead limbs of recreation pro-
grams and graft on some new limbs to better meet the recre-
ation needs of all the people.” The above is the opening
paragraph in his report to the community as published in
the local paper. In his closing paragraph he says that his
attendance at the Congress was most beneficial and will help
the Brockton Recreation Department to do even more for

the people. #

The New Conflict of Time & Money

Marion Harper, Jr.

THE DOLLARS and hours that people
have to spare are significant in
many ways—in how they live, in the
shaping of markets, in the success of
various product categories, and, even,
in the size of our national economy.
Time and money generally create op-
portunities for each other, but some-
times they are in conflict. Sometimes leisure and dollars are
poorly balanced; and the results are well worth study—in

 

relation to individual, business, and national goals.

The particular boast of our way of life is an advanced
freedom to choose. We have unmatched multiple choices in
how and where we live, what we eat, and drink, what we see
and hear, how we dress, where we go. What makes this
range of choice possible is a combination of money and
time, or, more properly, discretionary money and discre-
tionary time. The achievement of the United States has
been to provide more people with more discretionary money
and time than any other society in history.

It is remarkable to realize that leisure has been acquired
by people at large in such comparatively recent years. As
Thorstein Veblen pointed out in The Theory of the Leisure
Class, leisure was once the symbol of aristocracy. What
made a nobleman a nobleman was exemption from produc-
tive work. Today’s manufacturing employee works less than
two thousand hours a year, in contrast to three thousand
hours in 1900—and these two thousand hours include paid
holidays that were unknown to workers when most of us
were going to school. What have been the pressures for less
working time? Hours were first taken out of the workweek
for reasons of health and humanitarian concern. During
the depression, hours were reduced to spread work. In re-
cent times of prosperity, the workweek has been reduced
further for the greater enjoyment of the good life. This sug-
gests several propositions that we might consider:

MR. HARPER is president and chairman of the board of
McCann-Erichson, Inc., world’s second largest interna-
tional advertising and marketing organization. The above
is condensed from an address presented at a luncheon of

The Executive’s Club of Chicago.

1. Average leisure time increases from year to year, as a
byproduct of our gains in productivity. Today’s worker
produces about four to six times as much as his grandfather,
depending on his occupation. It would be ironical if he had
to put in the same number of hours at work.

Actually, he has about twenty hours of additional leisure
time. Along with a forty-hour workweek, his fixed time

segments include a fifty-six-hour sleep-week, a ten-hour 1

transportation-week and let’s say arbitrarily a six-hour
grooming-week, along with a ten-and-a-half—hour dining-
week (assuming thirty-minute meals and omitting discre-
tionary time spent around the table.) This means a leisure-
week of forty-five-and-a-half hours, or five-and-a—half hours
longer than the average workweek.

But even more leisure is in sight. All forecasters agree
that the trend of fewer hours on the ob will continue. A
few years ago we saw frequent predictions that a four-day
workweek would arrive in the sixties. Conceivably, automa-
tion and atomic energy could make this happen toward the
end of the decade. But riorht now the four-day workweek
with all its opportunities and problems———seems a little far-
ther away. It’s more likely that by 1970 working time will
shrink to thirty-eight hours.

2. Gains in discretionary income create pressure for more
discretionary time. This happens both through a normal
desire for more free time to spend extra dollars, as well as
through patterns of overtime wages.

At the turn of the century, almost all family income was
given over to the essentials of food, clothing, and shelter;
discretionary spending was the luxury of a very small group.
By 1947 the revolution in personal income had lifted about
half the country’s family incomes up to more than $4,000.
The trend is continuing so fast that by 1965, three-fourths
of all families will have $4,000 or more, and one-fourth will
have $8,000 and higher. By the end of the sixties, the prob-
lem of subsistence groups will be largely eliminated.

Today, the economy has the drive of $120,000,000,000 in
discretionary spending. With these wads of dollars burning
holes in, or at least scorching, the pockets of consumers, it
is understandable that people are putting a new premium
on their free time. Not only are holidays and vacations al-

RECREATION

\”

 

most invariable subjects of collective bargaining, but it is
not uncommon, as we know, for ofiice workers to extend
their normal vacation time by leaves of absence, particularly
'for foreign travel.

3. Leisure time is not simply an attribute of modern life
——it is a pervasive force in shaping it. Leisure is a cause.
Because leisure is usually thought of as something passive,
it is seldom credited as a dynamic influence in the character
of today’s living. Nevertheless, it might be argued that if
there hadn’t been a two-day weekend, today’s suburbs might
not have been created; or if the forty-hour week hadn’t
evolved, exurbanites wouldn’t have time for commuting——
with a few hours left for golf, scout meetings, shopping cen-
ters, and care of the lawn. It might also be said that indus-
‘ tries as basic as automobiles, housing, and textiles—leaving
aside the recreation industries of travel, television, and boat-
ing—would not have reached anywhere near their present
levels if our leisure class were not made up of virtually the
whole population.

Leisure’s influence on the economy is a subject which can
be explored far more than it has ever been. It is natural
that we should have concentrated on work as a creator of
output, but what should also be determined is what propor-
tions of work and leisure provide an optimum balance. If
we were suddenly to return to a sixty-hour or seventy-hour
week, we could conceivably plunge ourselves into a depres-
sion by drying up the market for leisure-time goods. Just
as obviously, too little work would leave us without ade-
quate goods to supply the market.

4. Time and money come into conflict when there is too
little of one to make satisfactory use of the other. You are
personally familiar with one example. The American exec-
utive is finding that while he may have discretionary money,
he has less-than-average discretionary time. A Fortune sur-
vey of top executives showed that almost one-third have a
workweek of fifty to fifty-five hours. Even bankers don’t
enjoy bankers’ hours anymore; a typical bank executive
puts in some fifty hours a week. Many professional men
also share with executives a relatively long workweek. One
study showed that one-half of all physicians in private prac-
tice work some sixty hours a week.

:JANUARY 1961

  

A dynamic young business executive
takes a look at

leisure’s influence on our economy.

One implication is obvious: One group in the population
which is especially motivated through interest and abilities
to make good use of leisure is getting less of it. Another
group, known as the moonlighters, have even less time on
their hands. More than three-and-a-half million workers
now hold down two jobs. It is more and more common for
a man coming home from a work-day that ends at four
o’clock to have a nap and supper and start out on another
stretch—perhaps driving a taxi or going the rounds of a
watchman or teaching night school. Here is a group for
whom leisure has less meaning than it had for people fifty
years ago. Their incentive seems to be to find more discre-
tionary dollars to buy a home, to send children through col-
lege, or to finance boats and swimming pools that the rest
of the family can enjoy. But the moonlighter, like the exec-
utive, finds his ample income and limited time conflicting
pressures in his life.

A more direct example of time and money out of balance
is found among our growing proportion of the elderly. Here
is the reciprocal of the executive’s and the moonlighter’s
confiict since the elderly find themselves with lots of time
but a very modest income.

It can be said that, while the elderly may have time to
kill, they don’t have money to burn. With greater longevity
and better health, older people are enjoying their abundant
leisure more and more. This enjoyment creates desire for
more discretionary income, obtainable through part-time
work or demands for more liberal old-age pensions. Rising
income may gradually ease this conflict of lots of time and
meager funds, and so create a balance.

We can assume, then, that there is an optimum balance
of time and money to suit different people’s interests. occu-

pations and age groups.

5. There is an optimum balance between time and money
for specific product categories. It doesn’t take much insight
to realize that expenditures for travel, boats, and swimming
pools require not only discretionary income but discretion-
ary time. The combination has created a leisure. market
that now exceeds $310,000,000000.

These are the now-classic items in leisure-time purchas-
ing. But there are many products—food specialties, bewi-

1i

ages, clothing, etcetera—which are sold day-in-and-day-out,
whose consumption also benefits from leisure time. Leisure
encourages entertainment which, in turn, helps sell a greater
variety of foods, beverages, and items of home decoration.
It also promotes a mood of pampering and self-indulgence
which may take the form of fastidious grooming and even
dandyism. A range of products, from boats to mink coats,
is dependent on leisure to a greater and less degree. A boat
requires both discretionary time and money. A mink coat
requires only discretionary money. Between boats and mink
coats, any product has its own optimum combination of dis-
cretionary income and time. Trends in leisure over the next
ten years may therefore be an important consideration in
the marketing of many products other than strictly leisure-
time products.

6. We are far more adept in counting money than in
counting the blessings of leisure. All through history, it is
possible to find sentiments both praising leisure and sound-
ing warnings against it. Disraeli pointed out that, “ln-
creased means and increased leisure are the two civilizers
of man.” Samuel Johnson said, “Money and time are the
heaviest burdens of life, and the unhappiest of all mortals
are those who have more of either than they know how to
use.” The late William Russell, a Columbia sociologist,
warned, “Too much leisure with too much money has been
the dread of societies across the ages. That is when nations
cave in from within.” It is possible to build a case to show
that we are on the brink of decadence or on the verge of a
popular renaissance.

Then inevitably there is television. We can interpret TV
watching in many ways—as a form of escape, as mental
stimulation, or as a new kind of participation in the world.
In any event, we do a lot of it. Adults—men and women
over nineteen years of age—today spend eighty-jive percent
as many hours watching TV (during the fall-winter sched-
ule) as all the gainfully employed spend at work. Many of
these hours, of course, include news or cultural programing,
which can be credited on the side of self-improvement.

In other cultural uses of leisure time, it is encouraging to
read that museum attendance, concert audiences, and classes
of adult education are all multiplying; people are also
spending more and more leisure time in creative expression
of their talents in all the arts and crafts.

As we achieve even greater leisure, it is interesting to
speculate whether people may develop patterns of guilt for
what they may believe to be a squandering of time. We have
a much lower threshold of tolerance than in Puritan days,
when the colonists passed laws “in detestation of idleness.”
A traditional hymn in many churches is “Work, for the
Night is Coming.” We can still, happily, distinguish be-
tween leisure and idleness—and it’s possible that still more

time on our hands may drive us to be more self-critical in
its use.

7. As well as discretionary dollars, the object of business
competition more and more will be discretionary time. Peo-

 

ple are still more likely to say, “I can’t afford it” rather than
“I can’t find the time”—but increasing concern with time

may be an important factor in buying or not buying. Every
advertisement that sells Hi-fi, TV sets, do-it-yourself kits, or
language courses appeals not only for a place in people’s
budgets but for a slice of their time. Advertisers of these
and similar products are literally “worthwhile.” It is possi-
ble that we may someday have a “buyer’s market” in leisure
rather than a “seller’s market.”

Families spend between sixty and eighty per cent of their
spare time in the home. This reflects the rush to the suburbs
and TV along with dozens of do-it-yourself and recreation
interests. It’s now possible that this trend has reached a
ceiling and that people may be ready for new forms of gre-
garious entertainment. A current example is the introduc-
tion of giant bowling alleys with forty to fifty lanes; they
are equipped with restaurants. snack bars, nurseries, and
laundromats. With bowling as the basic attraction, this new
emporium is a “supermarket” social center. Revenues from
collateral attractions exceed those for bowling. It’s a sign, .
perhaps, that we can look forward to a countertrend to to-
day’s dominant interest in the homeland to a revival of social
patterns of the days before TV and the suburban exodus.

Just as our present workweek creates discretionary in-
come, leisure, too, is directly responsible for discretionary
spending. It takes a prosperous country to support a market
for second cars, boats, fishing tackle and paperback books.
That is to say, people must work long enough hours to pro-
duce wealth for this market. On the other hand, the use of
these products requires ample leisure time.

As A NATION, we are often criticized for a prevailing ma-

terialism. Sometimes we give the impression that our
increasing leisure is simply an economic necessity to pro-
vide time for discretionary consumption as an end in itself.
But our economy achieves much more.

In a country with free institutions, no one can dictate the
uses of leisure. When we take out our productivity gains
in leisure, we are producing units of freedom in the fullest
sense. Nobody publishes figures on the production of free-
dom, but I would guess that in this commodity as in so many
others we would outproduce other nations of the world.
These units of freedom are thrown off from the cycle of pro-

RECREATION

 

They Work Together

Robert Tully

How the religious organization and public recreation can cooperate

REVEREND BILL BANKS was thinking
some long, tall thoughts as he
walked out of the office of the director
of parks and recreation one Monday
morning. Howard H. Henderson, a
triple-letter athlete, had been a real col-
lege pal. Today they had met again
after twelve years; they had reveled in
the memories of the past and then discussed their vocational
preparation and experiences since leaving college. More im-
portant, they had looked at their cooperative future in this,
their new hometown, Ashville. Bill was the minister of a
newly constructed, aggressive church and H.H., the park
and recreation director in this fast-growing community.
They had agreed to set down in black and white some
thoughts on religious organizations and community recrea-
tion. Bill was to think specifically of the religious organiza-
tion’s place and responsibility and H.H. of the responsibility
of public recreation to religious organizations.
When the two men met again, this time in Bill’s ofhce,
they exchanged the following points of view and sugges-

 

tions:

Religious Organizations

1. Religious organizations, because of their very nature
and purpose, have and maintain the right to speak out for
and against certain forms of recreation being sponsored
in a community. This may be a democratic privilege for
anyone in the community, but many religious groups feel a
deep moral compulsion to take advantage of this privilege.

2. The religious organization must first evaluate the rec-
reation needs of its own members as a group and then the
constituents as individuals. Often, this seems to call for a
social-fellowship recreation program for the constituents of
a religious group. Then, the church may turn its attention
to the individual needs.

3. Since religious organizations strive to give total di-
rection to life, they can give tremendous support to the rec-
reation programs of other groups. Written as well as verbal
announcements can be made.

4. Many religious organizations can share both facilities
and leadership for community leisure projects they consider
worthy. Perhaps no other single agency has worked so long
and so successfully with volunteer leadership. In many re-
ligious organizations there are trained recreation leaders
in such program areas as arts and crafts, social recreation,
sports and games, outdoor recreation, especially camping,
drama, and music, and they have been serving the local
religious organizations for years. They were trained, usu-
ally away from the local community, at district, state, or
national conferences, workshops, or institutes. Many do

not even consider themselves recreation leaders but their
skills are readily related to recreation.

Public Recreation

1. Public recreation, since it is tax-supported, must keep
its program broad in scope for all ages with no social, racial,
or creed discrimination.

2. Public facilities are available for group as well as in-
dividual use, often under other than public recreation lead-
ership.

3. Public recreation’s inservice training program can be
expanded to include some training of leadership for other
groups.

4. Public recreation can offer, through its leadership,
direct training services to leadership in other organizations.
It can offer community workshops or training institutes in
arts and crafts, social recreation, outdoor recreation, and
many others.

5. Public recreation may be able to share highly techni-
cal leadership with organizations that may not have such
leadership available through their own volunteers.

6. Public recreation must be moving out to fill in the gaps
or voids in community recreation that are not provided by
educational or social agencies or private and commercial
groups.

AFTER READING each other’s statements, the two friends
drew up the following specifics for themselves:

Bill would work to enrich and broaden his program by
using public facilities, such as recreation centers, gymnasi-
ums, swimming pools, parks, gardens, zoos, libraries, and
daycamp facilities. In addition, he would work with his
group and H.H. to see if there was any lag in the connnunity
recreation program his organization might meet. Bill also
felt that he would like to get some of his leaders in on the
local leadership-training program, especially in the areas
of arts and crafts, playground leadership, and the perform-
ing arts. He also invited H.H. to channel some community-
recreation announcements to him so he could use his line
of communication to support the public recreation program.

H.H. thought he might send a leader or two to district
or national training sessions if Bill would okay the project.
Also, he offered to set up a master calendar of training op-
portunities for recreation leadership in the area. All com-
munity organizations were to list their leadership potential
and then feel free to consult the list to develop their own
leadership training plans. In fact, he might plan to conduct
a top-notch training program, using his own and other pro-
fessionally trained leaders. Any community group could
send leaders for training. At least he would be willing to
have his oflice keep a file of the community’s leadership
potential, such a file to be available for all community

groups. #

Currents and cross-currents in the stream of recreation

 

0 EXAMINE THE current trends relating in some way
or another to recreation across the country, we must
follow many directions and find ourselves at many

crossroads. Today’s watchwords are:

THEME ' EXPLOSION ° SPACE ° SCIENCE
BOUNCE ° MALLS ' MAN-MADE
REGENERATION ° LOOKBACK ° SETBACK

THEME LAND. In community playgrounds, new muse-
ums, commercial amusement parks, the innumerable chil-
dren’s “villages,” “storylands,” and “fairylands” (both
commercial and public service) the big word is THEME.
From Disneyland on the West coast to Pleasure Island and
Freedomland on the East, the old-fashioned amusement
park with its ferris wheel and roller coaster has been widely _
replaced by dreamland “entertainment parks,” themed\.i

cisco earthquake on the half hour (Freedomland) and W

Mills, to reconstruct the storied realm of his childhood.

RECREATION

Theme playgrounds are nothing new in public recrea-
tion, of course, but the idea has been growing and seems
super-charged these days. Everywhere, play areas are keyed
to frontier towns, Wild West corrals, ships and shores, the
locomotives, the fighter planes and fire engines of yester-
year, the Space rockets of today, and even Dennis the Men-
ace. The same prevails in the commercial children’s “lands”
mushrooming across the landscape. Many are veritable
fairylands (for a fee) and some are merely commercial
tourist traps. Others strive to maintain high standards, such
as those established by the White Mountain Region Asso-
ciation in New Hampshire, whose members are proprietors
of tourist attractions. lts president, Robert Morrell, is
owner of Storyland in the heart of the Presidential Range.
Here children can board the North Country Special and
entrain for the towering pines, eat a picnic lunch.

The New York State Department of Commerce reports
that the state has more than fifty commercial “towns” cre-
ated expressly for children; many have a western theme.
Children may visit such places as Cimarron City, Totem
Indian Village, Rail City and Rip’s Retreat. Santa Claus,
of course, lives in many places. Christmas villages (both
commercial and public agency) can be found in many poles
to the north, east, south, and west. Hawaii is the magic
word in playground programing, with leis, grass skirts,
hulas, and luaus providing an exotic motif.

The many new museums, both profit and nonprofit, also
tend to be one-theme collections, devoted to a special in-
terest. The Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin,
is set up in the former winter quarters of the Ringling
Brothers Circus and houses an eighteen-ton calliope and the
other razzle-dazzle trappings of the Big Top. Administered
by the Historical Society of Wisconsin, Baraboo’s museum
is probably the only bona-fide education museum in the
world that sells popcorn and pink lemonade and invites
consumption of same on the premises. Other museums are
dedicated to dolls. The Antique Doll Museum at Sand Lake,
New York, has more than a thousand dolls from many na-
tions including a collection from the fifteenth to the twenti-
eth century. The Jocelyn Doll Museum at Fort Edward,
New York, perpetuates the display from the old Musee et
Hopital des Poupees established in Paris in 1750. While
the first museum ever specially set up for children—the
Brooklyn, New York, Children’s Museum, opened in 1899
—it is only recently that the movement for children’s mu-
seums and junior museums has really accelerated. In many
communities volunteer groups are helping to establish chil-
dren’s museums since they have come to realize that these
help the child to see the world more clearly, know it more
fully, and love it more deeply.

Even the “industrial” parks are joining the theme stream.
In Tampa, Florida, the $25,000,000 Anheuser-Buscll Bud-
weiser brewery is set in the midst of fifteen acres of gardens
open to the public. Among the area’s features are a hos-
pitality house with a heptagonal roof, 350 rare birds and

, animals (free-roaming) and a dwarf village complete with

toadstools and storybook houses. ' )

AN EXPLOSION YOU CAN’T DUCK. Everyone is talking

about the population explosion (or avalanche) but few can
give its exact dimensions. The U.S. gains one new person
every ten and a half seconds. The Census Bureau arrives
at this by adding the births (one every seven-and-a-half
seconds), subtracting the deaths (one every twenty sec-

onds) , adding the immigrants (one arrives every one-and-a-
half minutes) and subtracting the emigrants (one leaves
every twenty-three minutes). Result: less room here on
earth; soon, S.R.O.

Every explosion sets off a chain reaction. With the dy-
namic growth of populace have come pyramiding snarls and
problems, an explosive saturation point in recreation areas,
an exploding demand for more recreation services and a
great boom in family camping, family boating, bowling, in

private and home swimming pools, in the arts, in crafts, in
cultural pursuits, and in amateur science. State parks are
closing up shop early in the day—their parking lots full and

facilities jammed. Senior citizen centers have waiting lists.
To avoid traflic ams and congested beaches people are join-
ing private cabana and beach clubs, both commercial and
nonprofit, which might be termed the “new-suburbia coun-
try club.” These have also taken on some aspects of the
recreation center. As Robert L. Loeffelbein, general man-
ager of one such facility, The Glades Suburban Club in
Whittier, California, explains it, these clubs are “neither a
swim school nor a country club, but end up about halfway

in-between. . . . The one-level program of the swim school

(has been) expanded upon to include social, sports, arts
and crafts activities for all age groups.”

ATOMS FOR EVERYBODY. We have atoms for war,

atoms for peace, and we sure have atoms for recreation——
science clubs, rocket clubs, space toys, science books, as well l
as an absorbing interest in science on the part of the lay-
man. Today, the “Saturday scientists,” the amateur arche-
ologists, the amateur rocketeers, aquanauts, and astronauts
are all joining the exciting march of science.

However, a great deal of these new “scientific” endeavors
is more hyperbole than hypersonics; “science,” in many in-
stances, is merely a magic new label for the same old pack‘
age. A magic show becomes a “science circus,” nature
activities are renamed “science experiments,” and party
stunts are included in books as “science projects.”

BOUNDING BOOM. Bounding fun has Spread from the

gymnasium and public recreation center, and from coast to
coast customers are plunking down forty to sixty cents for
a half-hour bounce on a trampoline, rebotmd tumbler or
“Jumpin’ Gyminy”——or whatever it is called. This is the
most wildfire craze to hit the country since the days of the

miniature golf course—rebound “sportlands, pits,” and
“centers” are everywhere. Folks of all ages pay $1.25 for
an hour of advanced instruction in the sport, even though
some recreation departments supply it for nothing. The fad
started on the West Coast, has since spread to Hawaii and
the East Coast. To go into business, an operator builds him-
self some shallow pits, stretches out a few trampolines, putj;
out a sign—and the customers line up. St. Louis has foun 
it necessary to pass regulations setting up standards and re-
strictions for such establishments (see RECREATION, Decem--

ber 1960) . #

RECREATION

is directly concerned with the
nature and amount of recreation
activity in the United States for many
reasons. Longer vacations and shorter
work weeks have significant long-range
infiuence on the various types of recrea-
tion areas. A person works a five-day
week and the result is that he seeks his
recreation area as close to home as pos-
sible. Give him a four-day week and he
ventures further out for his fun and rec-
reation. With a long vacation he thinks
in terms of trips away from home. In
any event, expectations are that the de-
mands for all three types of recreation
areas will be on the increase within the
foreseeable future, and each of these
has implications for highway planning
and location. It is estimated by some
that expenditures for recreation travel
exceed $15,000,000,000.
Visitors to areas administered by the
National Park Service alone increased

from 21,000,000 to almost 63,000,000
between 1941 and 1959. In a study
made of tourism in Arkansas in 1956
it was found that there was almost a
doubling in out-of—state visitors be-
tween 1948 and 1956. During the latter
year travel service businesses in Arkan-
sas grossed $270,000,000, about 68 per-
cent more than 1948.

Tremendous Impact

Highway improvements have had
and are continuing to have a tremen-
dous impact on the development and
utilization of both national and state
parks. It has been demonstrated that
an area with outstanding natural attri-
butes will attract people to it, provided
reasonable means of transportation are
available. In fact, a national park’s
popularity is often tied in with avail-

ability of transportation. This fact is
amply illustrated in the case of Yellow-
stone where, between 1895 when the
park was opened and 1917, no automo-
biles were permitted to enter. During
the span of years the largest number of
visitors to this wonderful area was less
than 52,000. During the twelve years,
1917-1929, when cars were permitted to
the area, the number of visitors in-
creased to some quarter of a million
annually. In 1957 alone 1,600,000 per-
sons visited this park and over 97
percent of them came by private auto.
mobile. The park itself contains over
five hundred miles of paved highway;
and a network of improved highways
in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho af-
fords direct access to the park from all
principal highways. Similar increases
in visitors to Yosemite, Grand Canyon,
and Great Smoky National Parks also
have been experienced over the years,
mainly attributable to increased use of
private automobiles.

Construction of adequate highway
facilities have popularized recreation
areas and points of historic interest.
There is no doubt but that in years to
come more and more visitors will be

attracted.
The Eastern Shore of Maryland, with

its coastal areas and large recreation
potential, was a more or less dormant

area until the completion of the Chesa-
peake Bay Bridge. Crossings at this
point on the. Chesapeake Bay doubled
immediately after opening of the bridge
placed these areas within reach of peo-
ple from Washington, and several Vir-
ginia metropolitan areas.

The 173-mile New Jersey Garden
State Parkway illustrates how a modern
highway facility may have a fruitful
impact upon the immediate recreation
areas it serves. This highway has been
a boon not only to tourists desiring to
avail themselves of access to resort
areas but also has served to integrate
recreation activities with other develop-
ment, residential and commercial.

Recreation has long been an impor-
tant contributor to the New England
economy and Connecticut shares in the
recreation endowments as well as the
vacationist trade of New England. The
state owns and operates a large num-
ber of parks and forests where swim-
ming, boating, fishing, camping, and
other recreation activities are available.
There are also a great number of mu-
nicipal parks, private clubs, highway
picnic areas, and historical landmarks.
A survey estimated that out-of-state mo-
torists spent some $74,000,000 in Con-
necticut between July 2 and September
7, 1956.

The Connecticut Turnpike is ex-
pected to generate conditions which
will be beneficial to the further develop-
ment of recreation in that state since
it makes existing recreation facilities
more accessible to large urban centers.
Because the turnpike passes through or
near some of eastern Connecticut’s tin-
est recreation areas it may be that exist-
ing recreation facilities may have to be
expanded, new ones developed, and ad-
ditional tourist accommodations con-
structed, especially in turnpike towns
near recreation areas.

Forest Highway System
The Bureau of Public Roads has an-

other interest in public recreation facil-
ities, through its construction activities.
For a number of years the bureau has
received direct authorization for the

‘71

‘-n .

 

 

public-land roads. Main highways in
national forests are coordinated in a

25,000-mile forest highway system (as
of 1956); some seventy-seven percent
of this overlaps the federal-aid system.
Most of these roads are main state 01'
county roads. Financing of construc-
tion on the forest highway system is
with federal forest highway funds, fed-
eral-aid funds, and state or local funds.
Planning of the system and program-
ing of improvement projects for for-
est highway funds are done jointly with
the Forest Service and the states con-
cerned. Maintenance of completed proj-
ects generally devolves upon the state
or county.

In addition, the bureau has con-
structed all major roads for the Na-
tional Park Service since 1926, includ-
ing national parkways and roads in and
approaching national parks. Projects
to be improved on the jointly approved
system are selected in cooperation with
the Park Service. Maintenance is as-
sured by the Park Service after com-
pletion of construction. For instance,
in fiscal year 1959, $30,000,000 were

authorized for forest highway construc-
tion: $27,000,000 for forest develop-

ment roads, $16,000,000 for park roads,
$16,000,000 for parkways, and $2,000,-

The roadside park has been a boon to many a weary motorist.

This stopoff spot is Wildwood Park in Ohio, a pioneer in roadside rests.

United States for the purpose of mak-
ing the motorist’s trip more enjoyable,
as well as to serve as refuge for the
tired motorists and for emergencies.
These facilities have been labeled in
various ways along our federal and
state highways —- “roadside parks,”

” “wayside areas,” “safe-

77 66

“picnic areas,
ty turnout areas, historical markers,”
and so on. On the new interstate system
you will see them referred to simply as
“rest areas.” On the interstate system,
this sign may designate an area which
is simply intended for one or a few cars
to pull off for such purposes as map
reading, changing tires, or for emergen-
cies; or it may indicate an area resem-
bling some of the more elaborate road-
side parks now provided in such states
as Ohio, Texas, and others, where pic-
nic and sanitary facilities, historical
markers, telephone services, and so on
are often provided.

While roadside rest areas as we know
them today are considered a modern
innovation, the principle behind them
is of course as old as recorded history.
Modern roadside rest areas began to
appear along the highways in this coun-
try in the 1930 to 1935 period. Until
1956, roadside rest areas were in al-
most all cases built and maintained by
the states themselves. According to the
latest information available, some forty-
three states have established programs
providing roadside rest areas and of
these states at least thirteen have speci-
fic statutory authority for creation and
operation of such areas. Ohio is often
considered to be the “dean” of the road-
side rest area program, and statutes
providing for roadside rest areas in
Ohio are especially comprehensive see

000 for public-land roads or a total of RECREATION, May, 1956). The legisla-

$91,000,000. This was almost twice the
yearly authorization 1946-54.

Rest Areas

One of the most apparent indications
of the effect which modern highway
travel has had on recreation is in the
provision of rest areas along the road-
sides. Roadside rests 0r picnic areas
have been developed throughout the

22

tive provisions establishing a roadside
rest area program in California and
Pennsylvania are also quite comprehen-
sive. Both of these statutes were passed
only within the last two or three years.

While the location of such facilities
is primarily a state matter and depends
on such things as availability of sites,
the feeling of the bureau is that these
rest areas should normally be spaced
no closer than about every thirty miles.

Driving time between them should be
between one-half hour and one hour.
The types of facilities which can b
provided to advantage at roadside or
safety rest areas have been also give
a good deal of consideration by th
bureau and the various state highway
departments. While roadside rest areas
have, of course, been combined wit
service areas on many of the toll roads,
this is not the plan on the interstate sys--
tem. However, it is felt that roadside
rest areas can, in some instances, prop-
erly be combined with such facilities as
truck-weighing stations, state ports of
entry, travel information centers, ento-
mologic control stations, and so forth,
all of which are public agency facilities.

Criteria

The size of these rest areas along the
interstate system varies considerably
depending on terrain, and other factors.
A site of from three to five acres might
be expected to provide parking space
for, say, twenty to forty vehicles. Rough
rules of thumb have been established
for determining certain types of facili- l
ties based on the number of parking
spaces provided at the site. For exam-
ple, the number of table-bench units
will usually be from one-third to one-
half the number of parking spaces
available, and these table-bench units
should ordinarily have at least one-
thousand square feet of Space per table.
If outdoor cooking units are furnished, .
they are ordinarily provided for about
one-third to one-fifth of the table units.

While federal aid can be obtained for
purchasing the land necessary for a
roadside area and for constructing cer-
tain facilities on the rest areas, the
maintenance of these areas is the re-
This is a large item. A good many\i
states have learned through experience
what such agencies as the National

demonstrated so well—that highway
travelers can be encouraged to exhibit
their best behavior if they are providedl
with adequate facilities and if they are ‘
treated fairly and courteously. #

EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR SENIORS

The White House Conference on the Aging
emphasizes the need for re-evaluation

W. W. Shumard

FEW PROBLEMS facing recreation ad-

ministration today are more com-
pelling than that posed by the need for
more effective recreation services for
our senior citizens. As the White House
Conference on the Aging emphasizes we
must review the organizational pattern
we have developed for providing these
services. An evaluation should include a consideration of
our present methods of financing and of facility develop-
ment, particularly as they affect program. However, of all
the factors involved, perhaps the two most crucial ones are
the kind of leadership we provide for senior citizens and
the nature of the programs themselves. All of these factors
—organization, finance, facility, and leadership—lead into
the development of an effective program, and it is through
program that we serve people in the field of recreation.

 

Present Organizational Patterns—Our first area of concern
is our present organizational patterns. We all recognize,
I think, that the private or voluntary agencies have given
real leadership to the organizing of recreation programs for
senior citizens. Without doubt they have done much pio-
neering in this field. We are interested and impressed with

the San Francisco Senior Center. There the expression has
real meaning.

Unquestionably, in the years ahead we will need the
combined efforts of both voluntary and public agencies if
we are going to meet the recreation needs of our senior
citizens at all. This cannot be emphasized too strongly.
We must watch the experimental programs like the one
in Seattle’s Tallmadge Hamilton House of Senior Citizens.
There, in a private-agency setting, both voluntary and
public funds are being utilized to conduct a program that
has a solid research base. The Washington State Health
Department, the Council on Aging for Seattle and King
County, and the University Kiwanis Club are jointly spon—
soring this project. The type of planning and coordina-
tion that has gone into this project in its initial phases is
encouragement for the future. Such projects serve as a
model for planning and coordination.

As we expand our recreation services to senior citizens,
we must have sound judgment and maturity to avoid the
serious fragmentation and multiplicity of agencies su char-
acteristic of our services to youth.

Financing—This leads to a second important point: the
matter of financmg. Increased tax funds must be allocated
to programs for senior citizens if we are going to meet either
present or future needs, as the struggle for the ruluntar

dollar is a serious one. This will not he an earn anal: i'

.ll

 

will require aggressive leadership and commitment by en-
tire communities. Hence, we will have to look to additional
sources for income to support new programs. The crucial
question here might be phrased as follows: “What is our
senior citizens’ ‘fair share’ of the recreation dollars?” This
question is easier to pose than answer. It opens up areas
that we have been discussing for many years:

0 Should we totally subsidize adult programs?

0 Should they be partly self-supporting?

o Are increased fees and charges possible?

0 Must we make distinctions between income levels?

We first have to answer the question of priority. We have

long accepted the fact that our basic responsibility is to our
children; in fact, one of our limitations—in thinking about
senior citizens is our historic commitment to the younger
group. Recreation staffs have been trained to work young-
sters; programs have been built around their needs and in-
terests; and facilities have been constructed to appeal to
them. In short, youth has been our first priority. We can-
not alter this basic approach. Our need is to expand our
services to include senior citizens without cutting back on
our services to youth. In fact, if we do not continue to serve
all age groups, and particularly youth, we will be defeating
ourselves. Planning for adequate programs for older adults,
in the final analysis, begins with youth. It can be said that
the quality and quantity of recreation services offered to
the senior citizens in the year 2020 will depend largely on
the kind of recreation experiences that are offered to our
children between the ages of one and ten in 1961.

Facility—Much could be said about the importance of fa-
cility development. Two important items, however, need at
least surface mention: (1) design of the facility and (2)
location and pattern of use.

The design of facilities to be used by senior citizens needs
close attention. Examples of factors to be considered are:

0 One-Hoor level and complete elimination of stairs.

o Doorways large enough to accommodate wheel
chairs.

0 Special attention to lighting and heating.

Equally important is the matter of geographical location of
facilities for senior citizens. Out of a great deal of contro-
versy around this matter, three patterns have developed:

0 A centrally located building for exclusive citywide
use of senior citizens.

0 Neighborhood centers in which senior citizen pro-
grams have been organized along with youth and other adult
activities. This pattern has two variations: (a) joint, but
not exclusive use of any specific part of a neighborhood
recreation building; and (b) joint use of the building with

exclusive assignment of one part of the building to senior
citizens alone.

24

o A centrally located facility that is utilized by neigh-
borhood groups on a scheduled basis as a supplement to
neighborhood center programs.

In addition, I am firmly committed to the following

principles:

0 Location should be determined by the kind of pro-
gram that is envisioned.

0 First priority should be given to development of a
neighborhood center program. If additional funds are
available, a combination of neighborhood center programs
plus a central, specialized facility would be most desirable.

Leadership—In senior citizen programs, leadership is a
major concern. This involves three components: profes-
sional staff, volunteers, and senior-citizen leaders them-
selves. We would all agree that there are far too few people
professionally qualified by training and experience to do an
effective job with senior citizens. Such assignments are of-
ten difficult to fill, for a variety of reasons: much of the pro-
gram is conducted on weekends; groups are often very
large; and the work takes a great deal of patience, under-
standing, tact, and enthusiasm. The turnover rate of staff
for senior citizen programs is high; at the same time agency
needs for staff continue to increase. This presents a serious
problem; three specific needs are apparent:

1. More Adequate Education: We need to do a much bet-
ter job of training our college recreation majors in the needs
and problems of senior citizens. In the past we have empha-
sized child development. We have not incorporated into our
curriculums enough helpful information about the aging
process.

2. More Research: We recognize also that we cannot do
a better job of training and improving our methods unless
we build on a solid research foundation. The universities
need to lead at this point but their efforts must be supple-
mented by close cooperation with the field.

3. More Effective On-the-Job Training: We cannot sit
and wait for the arrival of more adequately trained recrea-
tion personnel; we must do a much more effective and con-
scientious job of training present staff. Within our own de-
partment in Oakland we have recognized this need and have
been willing to work at it. A specific course was conducted
within the framework of what we call our Wednesday sem- '
inar for all full-time staff. We need to provide even more
instruction for our present workers. We have no right to
expect a higher level of program until we do so.

V olunteers—Until we do a more adequate job of training
our volunteers we cannot expect a higher level of service.
In recent years seminars and workshops for leaders and
volunteers in senior-citizen programs have flourished. This ‘
trend must continue; it is consistent with our need for train-\‘
ing professionals; in fact, unless we do a better job of devel- 'rl'
oping professional skills we cannot expect to fully utilize
our volunteers. In short, both professionals and volunteers
need adequate training if we are to accomplish the high
goals we have set for ourselves.

Leaders from Senior-Citizen Group—~0ne further impor-\:
tant point needs to be made. We have learned from experi-
ence that leaders from within the senior-citizen group itself

RECREATION

 

can be most effective; in fact, there is some great work being
done in this area. We must offer them a training program
also. This is particularly significant since studies by the
University of Illinois and other universities show that the
older worker is “equal or better than the younger worker

in productivity, learning ability, and other important char-
acteristics.”

Program—In the area of program activities for senior citi-
zens, recreation has really come a long way. We have many
good programs; we are doing new and better programing
and can point to this with pride. In our local department
we serve well over two thousand or more oldsters in good
club programs and many times that number in activities not
geared just to this age alone but conducted for special in-
terest groups of all ages.

However, we have to stand back and look at the total
picture and be willing to speak frankly and openly. We
must examine the types of programs we are conducting;
their effectiveness; and finally, the principles on which to
build future programs.

Satisfying as activities in the club setting are, it is the
fringe recreation benefits that deserve special attention—
the planning and participating in hikes, dances, trips; spe-
cial programs; the special visits to the sick; the use of
the club for inspiring recreation alone or recreation in
smaller numbers between club meetings. The provision for
senior citizens in general-interest groups (such as dancing,
arts and crafts, drama, physical sports and activities) is
especially important. A lady aged eighty-five frequently
comments to one of my staff as she bounces into her weekly
arts-and-crafts class: “What are the old folks doing today?”
She means, of course, the group of senior citizens who are
participants in our regular club program in the same build-
ing. She has not been content to be “grouped” as a senior
citizen and has found great satisfaction in participating in
an interest group that includes a much wider age range. We
have many such priceless persons and we need always to
recognize their needs.

In our regular adult programs there are, of course, many
participants of senior-citizen age. Lawn bowling, golfing,
shufHeboard, tennis, book, garden and card clubs, spectator
sports, family camps, all the arts, the dance groups, service
groups—all the activities are too numerous to mention here
—as well as activities for entire families play a very impor-
tant part in the lives of senior citizens, even though we don’t
think of them in terms of this age group.

Effectiveness of our Present Programs—We all recognize
we must not fall into the easy pattern of mistaking quantity
for quality. No doubt the starting point in our programs
must be the larger social gatherings which bring together
and serve many senior'adults. There is no question that the
sociability, the card playing, the chance to talk and chat, the
opportunity for eating together and singing together have
tremendous values, and, for the sometimes rejected senior
adult, tremendous therapeutic influences.

However, we have too many outstanding examples of
creative, intelligent, growing-older citizens, to prove that
passive, repetitive, and deadend programing can never tap

: JANUARY 1961

@ PROGRAM

 

the resources of continued growth and development for this
age group. Until our programs reflect opportunities for
continued personal growth, wider cultural horizons, stimu-
lating intellectual activity, new purposes and deep satisfac-
tions which come from self-fulfillment, we cannot boast
about the effectiveness of our efforts.

We must apply a measuring stick to any type of program.
In planning for senior citizens our programs must be:

1. Planned with the aging population of the community,
not for them.

2. Organized. They need leadership and direction to ob-
tain maximum results. The use of volunteers and senior
citizens themselves should be an integral part of the plan
of organization.

3. Varied and flexible to allow for individual differences.
They should include physical activities; social activities;
music, dance, and rhythms; drama; arts, crafts, and hob-
bies; outdoor activities (nature, gardening, and camping) ;
spectator types of activities; study groups; and community-
service projects.

4. DevelOped to help the senior citizen feel a real and
basic part of the neighborhood and community around him.
He must not be allOwed (or forced) to'participate with his
own age group alone. He needs and desires the naturalness
and the values derived from association both with his own
age group and with the others that naturally make up a part
of any normal community.

ADEQUATE SERVICES for senior citizens will require the

teamwork of all agencies in the community. The rec-
reation worker particularly needs an understanding of how
to use resources as the case worker, the medical advisor,
housing officials, and welfare services. No one segment of
our broad social services can meet our present needs alone.
Therefore, one of our real challenges in developing service
to older citizens will be an understanding and utilization of
the teamwork approach.

At the same time we have our work cut out for us if we
are to convince the average citizen that our senior citizens
are entitled to a fair share of the recreation dollar. We can-
not accomplish this task alone. We will need the help and
energies of every agency and citizen group to which we can
tum. Let us dedicate ourselves to this task. The problem
is with us today and cannot wait until tomorrow. #-

ASSIGNMENT: GAMES 

A HOSPITAL recreation class at Washington State Uni-
versity in Pullman took on the assignment of inventing
an original device or adapting an existing game for hospital
patients. They produced fifteen projects in all, five new
games and eight old ones played a new way. Two are de-
vices for making certain types of recreation easier for bed
or wheelchair patients. Some of these are reproduced here
through the courtesy of Jane A. Harris, assistant professor
of physical education for women at the university. The
projects are keyed to the photographs on these pages.

Among others not included here because of space are
Magnetic Chess Board, by Loni Strickert, to keep chessmen
or checkers, on an unsteady board; Miniature Shumeboard

by Eva Bird, a small shujlleboard on a swivel base { using
regular shufleboard rules, players use disks which they
shoot with the index finger),- and Swimming the English
Channel, another board game ( players follow an interesting
course with disks or thumbtacks, determining their progress
by a throw of the dice). Full instructions for these can
be obtained by writing to Miss Harris at the University.

r I1 HIS SET could be made and used by any hospital patient
who has free use of his hands. The key is constructed
so that a message can be sent by either sight‘or sound. Two
boards should be made in order for two persons to receive
and send messages back and forth. To transmit to another
key,,wires would be connected to the batteries and the light.
To send by sound, a wire would be connected to the coil.
Equipment consists of seventy-five cents worth of simple
materials: two blocks of wood for the base; a tin can to
supply connections for transmitting current; four flashlight
batteries—“two each; two flashlight bulbs; two empty spools
(wrap on thirty feet of wire for coil) ; copper wire (covered
wire), fifty feet plus distance between sets times three if
connecting both sound and light; a few bolts and screws;
and two brackets to hold batteries (can use tape).

THE IDEA of using a flannel board as a background on
which to build a design out of variously shaped pieces
of felt is very usable for anyone who may have‘unsteady
hands or an uneven surface such as a bed or lap to play on.
A child or adult may be kept interested for hours creating
designs with the brightly colored pieces. 0n the back of the
flannel board are pockets where the cut pieces may be kept\%
in plastic bags when not in use. An additional use of the hi
idea is to save the felt shell from which the bright pieces
were cut. This shell may be placed on the flannel board and
a person may find it interesting to match the pieces into the
proper holes as if working a puzzle. This idea seemed de-
sirable for patients in a mental hospital who, even though ‘
they may not be capable of creating their own designs, \
might enjoy the association of shapes and color.

'I‘HIS TARGET game is played in the water. Beginning
swimmers or those with limited physical skills will

especially enjoy it—either individually or with a group.

A floating target and floating bean-bags are used and a
target is made by attaching a small hula-hoop inside a larger
one by means of three pieces of plastic tubing. The plastic
tubes also serve to divide the outside ring of the target into
three divisions. Each division is painted a different color
and assigned a different number of points: Blackn—IO
points; pink—20 points; yellow—30 points. The center
ring counts fifty points.

Floating bean-bags are made of small plastic bags filled
with ground foam rubber, plus enough beans to give weight.
This small bag is secured with a rubber band and sewed in-
side of a second bag made of colored plastic material.

Object of the game is to score the most points by tossing
the beanbags at the target. Each child chooses a color and
throws three to five beanbags of that color. The target may
.be placed at the shallow end of the pool thus enabling a
person to play the game while standing up. Placement of
the target will vary in distance according to the age or physi-
cal limitation of the players. The target may be secured to
the side of the pool by strings if necessary. As a water
activity for the handicapped, the game would need close
supervision, but it provides enjoyment and companionship
with others.

...NewGames 

THIS IS a new board-type baseball game primarily
designed for two players, each one having a team.
Rules follow official baseball rules. Each player picks
his team from the roster cards furnished and together
players decide home and visiting teams. A player con- .
tinues to spin the disk, moving his men around the '4
bases on the chart until he has made three outs. .
The baseball field is drawn inside the bottom of a 
box. Small squares of plastic foam glued to the box
form the bases and a player can easily move his players
(colored thumbtacks) from base to base by sticking ‘
them into the foam. The pointer is attached to the chart .
indicating the plays and spins easily by Hipping with .
one finger. A chart of scorecards is given as well as a
chart for the batting order. All of this is on cardboard

which folds up into the box when not in use.

Basketball Goal Toss by Donald v. Clark

HIS WAS designed primarily for a bed patient or those
restricted to very little movement. The game consists
of a miniature basketball standard enclosed in a box. A
Ping-pong ball is used. The floor of the court is COnstructed
with a number of holes in which the ball may settle as it
rolls about. The player can reach underneath the floor and
flip the ball so that it flies into the air toward the basket.
First place the game on the player’s lap or on a table in
front of player. Begin the game by tossing the ball into the
air over the playing area and letting it roll around the floor
of the basketball court until it settles upon one of the holes
in the court.
Now, place one hand under the court in the space pro-
vided, and with the thumb and forefinger flick the ball so
that it goes into the air toward the basketball hoop. If the

and the ball is moved the number of dots on the playfield as
is indicated on the dice. The game may be played by one to
four players and tournaments may be run off among many
players as in a regular golf tournament.

RULES:

1. To begin the game each player will roll for the highest
number with two dice. The player with the highest will have
his choice of lanes, the second highest the next choice, and
so on. The number of the lane also indicates the order of
turn for the first tee.

2. Each player will keep his designated lane for the en-
tire match.

3. One dice will be used. A player will advance the num-

THIS IS a modified soccer game, played by two players,
one at either end of the playing field, which is an en-
closed box. Five rings located at each end of the field are
connected to the kickers. These kickers represent the play-
ers of the two teams and are moved by pulling and pushing
the rings, thereby making it possible to maneuver a ball
about the field.
ACTION: Place the ball (a Ping-pong ball) in the middle
of the field. At the agreed signal, begin operating the kick-
ers to move the ball toward opponent’s goal. Object of the
game is to get the ball in the defender’s goal box which
scores two points. This is called a field goal. After a field
goal, the ball is returned to the center of the field to start

ber of spaces indicated by the dice. The player farthest
from the flag will roll the dice each time as in regular golf.

4. Every time the dice is rolled it counts one stroke for
that player. The number of strokes are counted as the score
for each hole.

5. If a player lands in a water hazard on his turn, he
moves his ball back two spaces.

6. If a player lands in a sandtrap, he loses one turn which
counts as one stroke.

7. In order to hole out, a player must roll the exact num-
ber of spaces to the flag, otherwise he will continue on past
the hole in any lane and shoot back for the hole on the next
turn.

box, it is a “dud” and scores one point. Then it is placed
in front of that defending goalkeeper and kicked out. The
opposite team can in no way hinder this “dudkick.” How—
ever, as soon as the ball is kicked the opponent can go into
action.

2. If at any time the ball is not in range of the kickers,
it is taken out to the center of the field and put in play.

3. If at any time the ball is kicked out of the ballpark,
the opposite team gets a free kick in. This kick is handled
in the same manner as after a “dud” is scored.

This game could be set on a table between two wheel-
chairs or on a table between two beds. A screen may be
used over the top so that the ball will not be thrown out.
For single use the game might also be used by tipping the
box at an angle so that the ball will have a tendency to roll
back to the player. It could be rigged with a light or a bell

to indicate a score at the goal end.

Did you get full beneht from National Recreation Month,
June 1960? I f so, you’re already planning your 1961 ob-
servance. If not, don’t worry: June 1961 lies ahead. Here
are four local stories which may provide a starting point
for you. They give a picture of the wide scope of National
Recreation M oath—and the many ways it can help you win
wider public understanding and support. (See also Page 46.)

IN ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA, Jack Puryear, director of
the St. Petersburg Parks and Recreation Department, set
out to win wide community cooperation——-—and did. Climax
of Recreation Month in his city came on Tuesday, June 28,
at 7 P.M. in Al Lang Field, where “Recreation Night” was
presented by the Leisure Time Committee of the Commu-
nity Welfare Council. Besides the council itself, organiza-
tions such as the Board of Public Instruction, Boy Scouts,
Girl Scouts, Gulfport Parks and Recreation Department,
Red Cross, YMCA, YWCA, St. Petersburg Police Depart-
ment, St. Petersburg Park and Recreation Department,
WSUN-TV and WTVT participated in the event. Each
had a chance to show what recreation could mean. The
Senior Citizens Center orchestra and chorus provided
music, there was community singing, square dancing led
by the parks and recreation department, and a circus act.
Also, the recreation department’s harmonica rhythm band
and the school band provided additional music, the Boy
Scouts gave an Indian dance, the YW presented a hula and
the YM offered an example of judo. There was boxing by
members of the Police Athletic League, a demonstration of
boat safety by the Red Cross, a Girl Scout camp exhibit, a
swimming and softball demonstration by the parks and rec-
reation department of neighboring Gulfport, and special en-
tertainment was provided by the radio and TV stations. It
was a rousing program of recreation on parade and a color-
ful way to show what recreation can mean.

Louisville, Kentucky, added a few flourishes to the Rec-
reation Month picture. Bert Combs, Kentucky’s governor,
received an official 1960 National Recreation Month poster
from Ellis J. Mendelsohn, president of the Kentucky Rec-
reation and Parks Society. Governor Combs released his
special Recreation Month proclamation to the press at the
time of the poster presentation, and the mayor of Louisville
also issued a proclamation. Throughout June, the Louis-

30

ville YMCA, the Jewish Community Center, the Jefferson-

County Playground and Recreation Board, and the Louis-
ville Department of Parks and Recreation had special pro-
grams, and the state’s newspapers, radio and TV stations
gave excellent coverage.

To the southwest, Austin, Texas, reports an all-out effort
to make every citizen of Austin conscious of the recreation
opportunities available through his recreation department.
Cooperative planning involved the Chamber of Commerce,
Community Council, the recreation director of Bergstrom
Air Force Base, radio, TV, and newspapers. For the third
year, Austin publicly awarded National Recreation Associa-
tion certificates for outstanding services.

Austin businessmen helped too. The American-States-
man advertising staff sold a number of ads that incorporated
the National Recreation Month emblem, and a full-page ad
by a local bread company carried a complete summer pro-
gram, a list of department facilities, and activities spon-
sored by youth-serving agencies. The National Dairy As-
sociation, through the Austin Milk Producers, underwrote
the cost of printing twenty-nine thousand leaflets listing
municipal playgrounds and swimming pools, bringing out

 

l

the highlights of the summer recreation program. Milkmen ‘

delivered these along their residential routes and others
were made available to the department for distribution to
areas not served by milk deliveries.

Finally, because so many communities have found that
National Recreation Month citations provide them with a
special way to say “thank you” to their most valued friends,
we would like to quote from a letter sent us by Harry B.
Van Bellehem, director of recreation and playgrounds in
Torrance, California: “I would like to repeat what I have
said to you in past years, with renewed emphasis on how
valuable this award has been to our department. It has
played a direct part in securing many benefits to the city
. . . securing the donation of a six-and-a-half-acre park, six
stone barbecues, a large playground equipment area, an
architect’s design for one of our parks, numerous pieces
of playground equipment, and countless hours of valuable
volunteer leadership.

“Since the N RA awards . . . I have already been contacted

by a representative of the Junior Women’s Club, a well- _I
known artist, and an outstanding architect, all anxious to ,

work on more recreation development for the department.”
Of course, we know that Mr. Van Bellehem’s good pro-
gram won and kept these helpers, but it seems clear that the
National Recreation Association citations helped to call at-
tention to the department, and provided an occasion for
the public to take note of what recreation is all about.

Means and Methods

Evaluation and assistance may be combined in the pro-
cess of supelvision by making use of such techniques, as-
pects, and suggestions as the following:

Wholesome Variety: Analyze with personnel and revise
program if needed to provide a maximum spread of day and
night programs, of child and adult participation, of daily
and holiday events, of individual and group activities for
both typical and atypical people, of ordinary and special
interest groups, of boy and girl separate as well as coedu—
cational participation, of individual as well as family \is-
itation.

Recognition: Select what methods of recognition exist to
provide incentive for participants, being sure to favor those
means which grant the widest spread of awards to the widest
number without overlapping or repetition.

Character Changes: Set up a consciousness on the part of
all personnel of criteria by which to judge progress in par-
ticipants’ habit and behavior improvement: socially ap-
proved language; replacement of aimless loitering by pur-
poseful participation; elimination of cliques. or reforma-
tion into social group with acceptable standards; improved
attitude toward opposite sex. other age groups. ethnic va.~

iants; decrease in fighting and increase in good sportsman-
ship; fewer antisocial acts and more interest in service
projects.

Rise of Leadership: Work out jointly a systematic approach
toward building leadership from within rather than from
without; that is, from participants of all groups to the end
that the facility may more and more reflect self-government.

Community Agencies: Carefully list, scan, and analyze com-
munity agencies, organizations, and institutions, such as the
churches, service clubs, and schools, indicating to what ex-
tent each is c00perating in the recreation program and what
else needs to be done to improve relationships with them,
particularly as involves community-sponsored groups as the
Boy and Girl Scouts, the CYO, the municipal and county
leagues, the police and probation clubs, and so on. Es-
pecially seek volunteers, supplies, assistance of all types from
the schools.

Parents: Make every efiort toward two-way c00peration:
(a) increase in the use of facilities by family units of both
parents, children, brothers and sisters;  increase in
financial, volunteer, and moral support.

Public Awareness: Educate personnel in the techniques of
public relations. Provide and obtain maximum favorable
reports in community publications, programs of meetings,
and other media. Measure results by a combination of
inches of space received, improved attendance, added fa-
cilities, community attitudes and understanding, backing on
legislation.

Sound Schedules: Go over the methods being used to ar-
range events and make these events known to the possible
participants by providing lists of coming events, both long-
range annual or semi-annual and short-term weekly or
monthly.

Emergency Provisions: Anticipate possible unusual circum-
stances—rainy weather, periods of extremes in tempera-
ture, conventions, and so on and prepare when-and-if-pro-
grams and activities. Judge results by comparing attendance
figures “before and after.”

Equipment and Facilities: Keep a record which enables
monthly or seasonal comparison as to the maintenance, ex-
tent of use, longevity, and variety of equipment checked

out, used, returned, lost, repaired; also keep a similar rec- I
0rd of the numbers who use and for what length of time they .
use the various facilities such as jungle gyms, tennis courts,
baseball diamonds, gymnasium floor. Note the percentage
of the time equipment and facilities are in use. By no means
neglect keeping a count on numbers of bystanders for these

are potential recruits to recreation.

Attendance and Turnover: Record and analyze in every
possible way playground attendance“ (some samples are
given above of feasible factors) but concentrate also upon
the extent of turnover, separating the number of “satisfied
customers” from the “transient trade,” seeking to find
means of making the latter into the former.

Health, Fitness, and Safety: Make certain of (a) training
of personnel and participants in first aid and safety precau-
tions as needed in case of fire, atomic attack, natural
disasters, activity accidents; (b) indoctrination of young-
sters in health and fitness practices that will be measurable
by physical and psychological changes through testing de-
vices.

Discipline and Regulation: Go over the methods and types
of supervision being used for improvement in (a) how many
individuals the director knows by name, interests, problems,
school, and so on; (b) how familiar the users are with the
“laws” of the playground; (c) how much the discipline is
self-initiated instead of externally coercive.

Type of Activity: Extend awareness of desirable modern
trends to shift from competitive activity to personal, indi-
vidual or group participation in activities with carryover
possibilities for lifelong enjoyment; that is from devotion
entirely to so-called major sports to the learning of tennis,
arts and crafts, etcetera.

Anti-Social Acts: Face frankly the necessity of systematic
planning for elimination of actions detrimental to morale,
the pocketbook of citizens, and the social scene in general.
such as gang meetings, vandalism, bullying and fighting,
thievery, malicious interference with enjoyment of others,
behavior serious enough to warrant calling police.
Overall Growth: Work out a sort of PQ (Playground Quo-
tient) which, in rough fashion at least, will give an indica-
tion over a period of time as to the effectiveness of both
supervisor and supervisee in carrying out the above listed
objectives and methods. #

* The National Recreation Association made a study of playgrounds
during this past summer. Findings will be announced later.

 

The new dimension of leadership recognizes that the task of filling the leisure vacuum cannot
be accomplished with single reliance on paid leadership, nor can our programs be defined as
“balanced” without adequate opportunities for citizens to give of themselves through services to the
community. As the demand for recreation increases, more emphasis should be placed upon the
potential of volunteer leadership including the participants. I am suggesting that the profession as
a whole re-examine its indifferent attitude toward the use of volunteers. We must expand our horizons
—stimulate our imagination, wake up our creativity and make the lives of the people with whom
we work more worth living tomorrow than they were yesterday. This is the greatest contribution that
the recreator'can make to community happineSS.—ROBERT W. CRAWFORD, commissioner of recrea-

Agency Standards and

Teenage Behavior

Edward J. Garcia

A STRONG CORRELATION exists be-
tween the standards an agency
establishes and the type of behavior
patterns teenagers will adopt while par-
ticipating in leisure-time activities. Al-
though many courses are given leaders

 

to increase their understanding of per-
sonal and intergroup behavior, the em-
phasis is still on the activity or sport, with the general as-
sumption that behavior problems are not a source of serious
consideration. This kind of thinking is rapidly changing
because of the realization that behavior problems hamper
programs, mean facilities are not being used to capacity,
and make support of recreation activities in communities

difficult.

The test of an agency lies in its ability to practice what it
preaches; the image it reflects tO the community depends on
how well its standards are defined, presented, and upheld.
In short, it is the commitment of responsibility assumed and
the courage to uphold that commitment by the policy-mak-
ing group as well as by the administrative and program
staff. This can be done by following a few basic concepts.
The degree Of success can only be measured by the extent
to which each concept is practiced every single day.

Concept of Commitment: All agencies should have a clearly
defined philosophy and be prepared to live up to their stated
purposes at all times. Little respect can be expected for
agencies having profound philosophies and weak standards
of operation.

Concept of Humanity: This concept encourages staff to con-
vey to people that they are human beings first, with all of
the qualities, both good and bad, that God has given men.
Adolescence is a very emotional period of life and a time
when young people feel that adults are cold, aloof, and not
understanding of their turmoil. Results can be seen not by
condoning unacceptable behavior but by reacting to it emo-
tionally so that teenagers can see that you are not much
different than they as human beings.

Concept of Limits: A great deal Of time and energy is wasted
by teenagers in testing the threshold of an agency and its
personnel if standards‘are vague and inconsistent. In many
cases a minority group will control the use of the agency
by intimidation and fear; as a result, many teenagers who
would ordinarily avail themselves Of the program are lost.

hood House, Riverdale, New York. This material is based
on a talk he gave at the 42nd National Recreation Congress.

EgADMINIS TRATION

 

If good standards are maintained, more teenagers will
participate and more community support can be expected.
Likewise, less conflict will arise because freedom Of expres-
sion can be exercised within a framework that has been

predetermined as having the greatest value to the enjoyment
of everyone.

Concept of Fear: Though fear is related to insecurity, it can
also have a useful and positive purpose. Many young people
go through life literally unchallenged as to their behavior.
Fear, used judiciously, can serve at best as a stimulant in
bringing about a reevaluation of thought. Fear can also
help to alter a pattern of behavior by creating doubt. This
dOubt, in turn, begins a process of thought and evaluation.
Fear or threats will not stop or prevent antisocial behavior,

but they can shake up the security of an individual whose
behavior has gone unchallenged.

Concept of Communication: “Never get down to their lev-
el.” “A leader should never be part of the group.” “A
leader should always conduct himself in a professional man-
ner.” These statements and Others of similar nature have
been part of our training. However, one must consider that
part Of the teenagers’ hostility towards adults is their belief
that adults are better than they. One of the areas in which
teenagers find themselves most inadequate is that of poise
and Of language. The adult usually has a better command
of words and can usually out-talk and out-reason the young-
ster. In an effort to retaliate, young people resort to foul
language, use of fists, or the gang.

Leaders should recognize the difference between commu-
nication and verbalization when talking with teenagers.
More can be achieved not by what you say, but how, when,
and why you say it. There are leaders whose greatest form
Of communication is their facial expression, a smile, or a
stare.

Concept of Mutual Understanding: The concept of under-
standing deals with only one phase Of its meaning. It is the
assumption that no rapport or positive relationship can be-
gin until the teenager knows what he can expect from the
leader and the leader knows what to expect from him. Re-
move all doubts and curiosities, and, above all, be consist-
ent in the daily patterns Of work.

Concept of Self: Like most adolescents, there are some
leaders who refuse to present themselves as they really are.
Young people are sensitive to artificiality and quick to rec-
ognize it in an individual. It is important that each leader
develop his own approach in working with people. A sense
of comfort and naturalness should accompany his method

N DISCUSSING NEW concepts in archi-

brace the whole field of recreation.
This one word poses a very big prob-
lem, because recreation is certainly eas-
ier to describe than to define. In 1918,

adopted, as one of its seven principles,
this one description: Recreation is the
“worthy use of leisure.” So, when we
talk of park and recreation structures,
it would seem to include all buildings
that the public might use when pursu-
ing a use of their leisure time. What-
ever recreation may be, it is certain that
the one prime ingredient of it is people
—people using their leisure.

There are those who love con- 1

know they ought to like it, but often
can’t help finding more pleasure and
satisfaction in the architectural ele-

Are there any new concepts in park
or recreation buildings? It may be that
there is a new method of expression,
but the term concept indicates. some-
thing very fundamental indeed. Though
it may well be that concepts cannot
change, possibly the approach to design
is different. There has been some re- 1
striction in the use of the more familiar
handcrafted materials; the increased
acceptance of cast materials and ma-
chine-made products; and, perhaps
most important, the realization by the
designers that space, spatial values, and
the psychological effect of buildings
upon people are important design con-
siderations.

Basic to all is the ever-present ques-
tion of economic value—as much an
architectural criterion as it is a yard- .
stick for every human activity in this“
world of inflated values. This has an Ti
effect upon the solution to a given situ-
ation and a final design; all elements
are carefully weighed and balanced,
and the resulting compromise repre-
sents the solution.

Nowhere has the importance of effec-

tive cooperation between the profes-

sions of landscape architecture and ar-
chitecture been as important as in the
production of wisely developed areas
in park work. Both professions are
dominated by the creative urge, a basic
interest in aesthetics, and the ever-dom-
inant dependency on people. Parks are
often considered in the sense of scenic
areas and have often been set aside be-
cause of the particular effect created by
the surroundings. For buildings to be
placed in a scenic setting, there must
certainly be a consciousness of the cor-
relation between land and anything

.sonances or structures boldly placed
upon it. The ground plane has a flow;
buildings should be a part of this. The
natural scene should at all times remain
dominant.

As we view some of the earlier work
in parks, the heavy solidity and mas-
siveness of stone structures and ex-
tremely high-peaked roofs occupy a
very dominant place in the scene. By
providing a cover of trees which,
twenty years later, have grown to ma-
turity, we have managed to hide this
type of building. But this is not a sound
design approach. Buildings should and
can be compatible with the setting; to

hide or bury them is a denial of their
need.

look with a porticoed walk 

Though we have spoken of buildings
being of the land and flowing normally
from it and of resenting structures
merely placed upon it, there are so
many land forms present in our country
that the principle implies there must be
exceptions. In areas of soft land form,
such as sand dunes and other simple,
softly rolling countrysides, a contrast
may be most satisfying. In general, we
try to think of not silhouetting build-
ings against the sky; but where there is
little or no vegetation and soft land
forms, silhouetting against the sky be-
comes a design requirement; it cannot
be avoided. In this type of terrain,
structures can be delicately and com-
passionately handled. Properly con-
ceived buildings will still be unobtru-
sive. So we think in terms that the land
form is a base and is solid. Things upon
the land are less solid, often pierced or
somewhat open. The sky is always
transparent and light. So it is a pro-

gression from solidity to lightness.

cessful architect is always striv-
ing for better communication. To speak

sense, buildings are largely constructed
of signs and symbols. Certain materials

In the psychological

 

might call up mental images of weight,
hardness, and of relevant facts like costs
and maintenance. The exterior of a
building suggests what goes on inside,
both as to function and arrangement.
A dome may influence your feeling and
remind you of a state capital, the Capi-
tol Building in Washington, or St.
Peter’s. A color might suggest the sea
or the sky. A column can make us
conscious of the weight of the load it
carries. A windowless wall suggests se-
clusion, confinement, or, perhaps, pro-
tection. In a multitude of ways, the
forms and materials we see mean some-
thing to us. Perhaps even the forms we
do not see in the current crop of park
and recreation buildings can mentally
influence our emotional reaction to sim-
ilar structures from the past.

Forms evoke pictures of physical ob-
jects, borrowing from them some of the
mood, flavor, or emotions which these
objects produce. Symbols can also refer
to actions and activities, for they vary
from wildly dynamic to the solidly sta-
ble, depending largely on whether they
suggest movement or potential move-
ment. A rectangle is highly stable; a
circle suggests the possibility of rolling
and, therefore, lacks a stability. Some
materials are self-suggestive—concrete,
steel, stone. One is cast, another manu-
factured, and third, natural. Perhaps,

35

the mass-produced materials, lacking in
surface variation and texture, quickly
begin to seem sterile.

There is no such thing as an obsolete
material; stone, wood, brick, adobe are
almost as old as time and are excellent
building materials. In the park archi-
tecture of the thirties, these materials
were lavishly used. Today, we can no
longer afford those beautiful stone walls
and the “rustic” stonework in buildings
where each rock was placed with loving
care and studied indifference. This type
of structure is rapidly disappearing
from the scene because of the high cost
of labor, the ever-thinning ranks of
highly skilled craftsmen and the high
cost of many rustic-type building mate-
rials. Those who love and enjoy the
work done during the thirties by the
CCC camps and others in both state and
national park work, are living in the
equivalent of an economic dream world.
Perhaps that is what our recreation ar-
chitecture should strive to achieve, the
stuff of which dreams are made; but it
is doubtful if another such state of af-
fairs in this country, where labor is
endless and materials are plentiful, will
ever again exist.

BUILDINGS SHOULD have an emo-
tional impact, too. Like a painting

or a piece of music, things less definite
of interpretation than most sculpture, a
building can mean different things to
different people. Forms can also be
psychologically disturbing or satisfy-
ing. Those which suggest strain and
effort are jagged or contorted, are often
uneasy and hostile to a sense of calm
and well being. This effect has no place
as an intrusion in the leisure time of
park visitors. Design that is enduring
has a quality about it of peace and
quiet; it does not disturb or excite. It
is pleasant for association and, because
it is, people are pleased, though they al-
most never know why. If this is accomp-
lished, then you have good architecture.
What is proper for a scenic park
would not apply to a historic site or
city parks, particularly playground
areas and swimming pools, where the
mood the designer is attempting to cre-
ate would be quite different. Just as
all parks are used as a source of enjoy-
ment away from home, so the city park
is important in its special function. To

36

a great many, it provides relief from
the association with squalor and sordid
surroundings, at least in some of our
big city situations. In all situations,
there is a portion of the escapist philos-
ophy involved—a desire for a change of
setting and avoidance of more exposure
to the usual daily scene and group of
associations. In the city, there is a
proper place for the use of exotic forms
and a certain free-wheeling in design.
For those who use the facilities, it may
suggest an entirely new and better
world.

Today, most successful architects
practice their profession in cities and
their work is largely confined to the
urban scene. Therefore few truly un-
derstand land, land values, and topog-
raphy. The mathematical computations,
the algebraic and geometric purity of
such great architects as Mies van der
Rohe are worthy of the cities. They are
often great and challenging, but placed
in a natural area, could be nothing but
out of place.

WE ARE all aware that, regardless of

whether the architecture is at the
city, state, or national park level, all
work today is accomplished through
committee thinking. This brings into
play a portion of all of us that seeks an
outlet. We all become design critics,
with thoroughly schooled and hallowed
thoughts; for it has long been recog-
nized as an occupational hazard of the
architect that he, of all people associ-
ated with a problem, knows least about
it. This is particularly true in all phases

and at all levels of government work. -

The welding of all opinions and the
solving of all problems can only result
in compromise. There is very little evi-
dence that great or important architec-
ture ever evolved from committee think-
ing or compromise. This, in itself, may
be a mark of twentieth century Amer-
ica; yet the architecture now being cre-
ated may solve a unique problem and
create a great architecture that one hun-
dred years ago would have been con-
sidered impossible.

I am sure a great many architects
wish there was a greater separation be-
tween administrative and design func-
tions and that their work was judged
by their peers, who had an equal or
more intimate understanding of the to-

tal problem. However, in the final anal-
ysis, the ultimate excuse for being an
architect is to create structures that, to-
the greatest degree possible, are aes-
thetically pleasing and, occasionally,
works of art, in spite of, or maybe be--
cause of, the compromises inherent in-
committee solutions. In dealing with»
these forces of committee thought and
compromise solutions at each level, we
can be aware that there are forces be-'
yond the acceptance of our willingness
and our desirable participation that are
constantly exerting strong and some-j

human beings. It is created by them,l
for their use. It follows that architects.
must understand peOple, their needs,
thought processes, their reactions. In

Architecture begins and ends with

conceiving development projects, ad-
ministrators at all levels could do well
to remind themselves of this. The ar-l

world should be the very best. The peo-
ple support and use the park facilities

Public Housing Recreation

A two-hour panel discussion held
during the Pacific Northwest Regional
Conference of the National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Offi-
cials stressed the importance of effec-
tive liaison between regional field em-
ployees of national agencies, whether
public or private, and their local coun-
terparts. The panel included Charles
Odegaard, Pacific Northwest district
representative of the National Recrea-
tion Association, and regional and state
representatives from the Agricultural
Extension Service, Public Housing Ad-
ministration, Bureau Of Indian Affairs,
and other agencies. The point was made
that the long working relationship be-
tween the National Recreation Associa-
tion and the Public Housing Adminis-
tration, both nationally and locally, has !
been responsible for the fact that local
recreation departments and agencies
are now planning recreation and pro-
viding recreation leadership for low-
rent public housing project facilities.

MAINE. Recreation has been going island hopping in
Portland whose population is spilling over onto the many
islands in Casco Bay, eight of them being within city limits.
Peakes Island, twenty minutes away from the city proper
by boat, now has a population of one thousand. During
the summer months Big Diamond and Little Diamond ls-
lands have a large population. In order to provide the rec-
reation services requested by the islanders, Portland has
had to set up some new patterns in programing and super-
vision. Part of the answer was to insist that the islands
establish good volunteer working committees to assist the
recreation supervisor. During the ten-week summer period
a recreation supervisor works three days a week on Big
Diamond and two on Little Diamond. On Peakes the gram-
mar school has been enlarged to include a game room and
a gym for teenagers. Peakes offers an active dance program
for teenagers and square dancing for older folks.

Other areas of Portland are also enjoying new facilities.
A. three-acre playground was added in 1960 and a wooded
area adjacent to a new elementary school will provide a
terraced playground during 1961. This will be built on a
number of levels to separate activities, the trees providing
shade for equipment areas. The city built one totlot in 1960
and will add two more in 1961. In addition to boat ramps
built in 1960, Portland will construct a new dock this year
and provide additional swimming facilities with grass pic-
nic areas nearby.

MICHIGAN. Let others sing of old MacDonald and his
farm. In Kalamazoo, the Douglass Community Association
is singing of Kenneth Melching and the farm he donated to
the association—forty acres complete with a house, barns,
equipment, pigs, a pond, and wooded area. Last summer
the association used the farm for day camping and family
farming. This winter the pond is being used for ice skating.
By next summer the association hopes to be able to use the
farm for overnight camping and horseback riding. Six fam-
ilies were allotted vegetable patches last summer and were
so enthusiastic about the privilege that more families have
requested and have been assigned garden plots, particularly
strawberry patches, for this coming summer. Six miles of
paved roads facilitate travel from city to farm. The asso-

 

finest facility. The building includes a pavilion open on.
one side and has an elevated concrete stage at one end.

37

ciation is glowing about all possibilities of the facility even
though managing the livestock had its pitfalls and pigfalls.

NEW HAMPSHIRE. Development of a new area which

will increase uphill lift capacity by twenty—nine percent and
add another fifteen acres of skiing terrain is nearing com-
pletion at Mt. Sunapee State Park, one of the state’s major
ski centers. Scheduled for opening next winter, the devel-
opment will increase the number of major lifts to four, with
a total hourly capacity of forty-four hundred, and boost
to nearly one hundred the skiing acreage on the twenty-
seven hundred foot mountain.

Construction of the area started last fall under an $81,707
capital improvement program approved by the 1959 legis-
lature. The bond issue will be repaid from the state park’s
income. With further expansion in mind, the New Hamp-
shire Recreation Division—which administers Sunapee and
Cannon Mountain in Franconia-—-designed the area to link
with the previously developed Duckling Slope and its rope
tow and the upper sections of other trails on that side of the
mountain.

0 A thirty-acre island in Lake Pemigewasset in New H amp-
ton is being made available to youth organizations for rec-
reation purposes, according to J. Wilcox Brown, president
of Parks Associates, the owners. Mr. Brown plans to revive
the name of Kelly’s Island which appears on old maps but
has not been in general use in recent years. The Kellys
were among the early settlers of the town, clearing land
on the high ridge to the south of the lake. Mr. Brown said
the entire island will be leased to groups interested in out-
door recreation by the day or week and to nonprofit organ-
izations at half-rates. Mr. Brown and his colleagues bid in
the island when it was offered for sale by the state for the
express purpose of preserving it for eventual public use.
When the state originally offered the island for sale there

was great danger it would be purchased for private interests
and closed to public recreation.

NEW YORK. Four private agencies in Poughkcepsie con-
solidated their services under one banner as of January 1.
The merged agencies, which have been under the United
Fund-Community Chest, are now known as the Neighbor—
hood Service Organization. The agencies involved are the
Catherine Street Community Center, the Lincoln Center, the
Fair Club, and the W. W. Smith Community Center (in a
housing development). They will coordinate their services
under one board which will include representatives of the
board of education and the recreation commission.

NORTH CAROLINA. A “garden that might have been"

survived. It blends English landscaping in the Elizabethan
tradition with the natural beauty of Roanoke Island, and
is adorned with antique statuary and garden ornaments, as
well as walls of ancient brick and extensive plantings of
flowers, herbs and ornamentals. The site covers ten acres
adjoining Fort Raleigh, scene of Sir Walter Raleigh’s ill-
fated attempts to establish permanent colonies on land
claimed for England by his expedition of 1584-, and site of
the annual “The Lost Colony” presentation, inspired by
the mysterious disappearance of the colony from Roanoke

Island in 1587.

OHIO. According to the Cayahoga County Regional Plan-
ning Commission (which includes Cleveland) the number '
of boat owners in the area will double by 1970. This would
bring an additional forty-five hundred boats into the county.
Planners say this will require seventeen hundred additional
dock spaces and seventy-five to one hundred more lanes of
launching ramps. The county now has twenty-seven hun-
dred dock spaces and twenty-live boat launching lanes. The
commission says a complete marina is urgently needed
along the Cleveland lakefront and suggested an existing
Nike site as the most desirable.

o The tireless Cincinnati Recreation Commission will build
two nine-hole golf courses in the city’s Western Hills areas
at a cost of $622,000, including land. As a start on the
long-awaited redevelopment of Cincinnati’s central water-
front area, the park board has acquired a plot called Yeat-
man’s Cove, just north of the public landing. It was here
the first settlers of Losantiville (later renamed Cincinnati) I
came ashore from flatboats shortly before New Year’s Day '
in 1789. The area will be sodded, planted, and equipped '
with benches. In the city’s Eden Park the new $150,000
Murray Seasongood Music Pavilion was donated by Mr.
Seasongood’s late sister, Martha S. Stern, in memory of
his public service. The recreation commission’s nature and
camping division has a new $49,000 rustic lodge on a
wooded knoll overlooking a day-camp site, called the C. L.
LaBoiteaux Memorial Lodge in honor of the late donor of
LaBoiteaux Woods to the park board. Its exterior is red
cedar and stone, and it will contain an activity room, rest-
rooms, a cloakroom, workroom, a ten-foot stone fireplace,
and removable lighted display cases.

VIRGINIA. The state has embarked on a program, known

as the Natural Areas System, to preserve small wilderness 3
areas scattered from the mountains to the sea. Its first pur-
chase under the program, made in September, was 759 acres
of highland and marsh and two miles of beach frontage on
the Chesapeake Bay side of the eastern shore near Onan-

cock. It will be set aside for public use or hiking or for?
scientific study. 
According to Monroe Bush, assistant to the president of I
the Old Dominion Foundation, which proposed and spon-
sored the project’s start, “Virginia is the only state trying
to preserve areas in this way. It is also the only state think-
ing in terms of small areas, where a father can take his son
for a walk or Scouts can go on a hike in natural surround- l

became a reality on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island, this
summer. The Elizabethan Garden, built and maintained
by the Garden Club of North Carolina, Inc., is a memorial
to the English colonists of the 1580’s whose story is told
by nearby Fort Raleigh National Historic Site and “The
Lost Colony” drama.

Not a restoration or a replica, the garden might have

been created by Sir Walter Raleigh’s colonists had' they ings.”

Labor and Leisure

The UAW’ s recreation program o]?ers “everything possible. . . .”

lga M. Madar

I ERE IN THE United States we have
| established a mode of living

whereby our occupation fills but
. portion of the day. There is a very
eal meaning and application of the
0rd recreation. What is the UAW
United Automobile, Aircraft and Ag-
icultural Implement Workers) doing
bout recreation? The question is a
iflicult one to answer briefly. Yet, in
um and substance, one who knows the
TAW Recreation Department, its ob-
ctives, its operation and its program,
ould reply with a simple phrase—
Everything possible. . . .”

The UAW Recreation Department
'as organized in 1937. Its formulation
'as based on the belief that Within the
'isure hour of man, certain creative,
dventurous, social, and competitive
tisfactions might be derived which
ould make for a richer and happier

 

ISS MADAR is director of the United
-utom0bile Workers Recreation De-
, artment, Detroit. Digested with per-

iission from Employee Recreation.

life. From knowledge gathered in study-
ing our country’s industrialization, and
more specifically from the awareness of
the job demands of the average working
man, the program has been an active
and a flourishing one. Now, based on
present indications that skills for the
gainful and enjoyable use of leisure
are not inherent in most human beings,
the department’s efforts are expanding.

The UAW recognizes that recreation
skills and attitudes and the building of
sound programs are responsibilities of
the home, the schools, and the com-
munities, of the local, state, and na-
tional government. There is a sincere
and continuous effort to work with
every existing agency concerned with
the same broad recreation aims and
goals. Need for better public recrea-
tion facilities such as parks, picnic. and
camping areas; playgrounds, libraries.
and museums; for improved programs
of art, literature, and music: for trained
and capable leadership in recreation;
for study of all aspects of legislation
which affect the leisure of the people

and the costs of recreation to the citi-
zens . . . these, too, fall within the seri-

ous regard of the UAW Recreation De-
partment.

HOW DOES all of this come about?
How does such a department func--
tion? The home of the [WW Recrea-
tion Department is in Detroit. Here,
the department plans. evaluates, studies,
investigates needs and interests, and
operates the program. It prepares liter-
ature and publications. It assists in the
training of the huge volunteer group
that carries so much of the program’s
leadership responsibilities. It engages
in the follow-up work which is so i111-
portant in continuity of program.
The department is made up of a di-
rector assisted by several staff members.
Each staff member is also concerned
with a particular region (geographical)
of the overall UN“ organization and,
from time to time. does field work in
these innnediate areas. Recreation
councils play a ke}r role in the imple-

mentation of the program. These coun-

39

cils are composed of representatives
from local union recreation committees.
They, too, function in a prescribed area.

Currently, there are twenty councils
operating. It has been evident that
where staff members from Detroit are
available for service in a particular re-
gion, there is success in organizing and
guiding the work of the recreation
councils. The variety of activities spon-
sored by a council is dependent some-
what on this help. And exemplifying
the smallest structural unit of the rec-
reation organization of the UAW is the
local union recreation committee. Much
of the crucial work comes from indi-
viduals making up these groups. Thou-
sands of union members are doing rec-
reation work on a volunteer basis. For
these individuals, staff members con-
duct workshops at summer schools and
hold recreation conferences.

The tremendous program is financed
primarily by dues money and by indi-
viduals who participate in the program.
One cent of the UAW member’s month-
1y dues is allocated to the recreation
department, which, in turn, allots half a
cent to each of the various regions. At
the local union level, the half cent is al-
located to the recreation committee.
This half-cent appropriation in locals is
a minimum amount. Locals may set
their own maximum—some per capita
assignments are as much as six cents
per month. To supplement this, some
funds are collected from tournament
and league entry fees and tuitions from
partially self-sustaining activities.

ACTIVITIES ARE directed towards pro-

viding opportunities for participa-
tion for members of all ages, varying
degrees of skills, for both sexes, for the
families of UAW members and always
with consideration of their paychecks.

It is through activities that the depart-
ment attempts to unite UAW members
and to link the union and community
in joint-sponsored, low-cost, soundly
guided recreation.

An example of the activities that have
been sponsored under the Detroit Rec-
reation Council
archery, golf, fly and bait casting, gun

includes clinics in

safety, pool and billiards, and a follow-
up of instruction classes for those in-
terested in continuing the activity.
There is inter-league competition in
baseball, softball, slow-pitch softball,
bowling, and golf. Tournaments are
also conducted in archery, golf, bowl-
ing, pool, and billiards. Children’s tap
and ballet classes have been sponsored,
along with coloring contests. Conser-
vation and sportsmen’s shows have been
conducted, and there are interest clubs
-—-photography, crafts, music.

Other competitive programs spon-
sored by the department are the inter-
national bowling and golf tournaments.

During 1959, entries in bowling took
in more than 700 teams—3,000 ‘doubles

and 3,200 single entries, representing
139 local unions from 60 cities in eleven
states and one Canadian region.

Of course there are the traditional
functions, such as Christmas parties for
the children conducted by the local rec-
reation unions, and the family picnics

and carnivals which appear to have a
favored spot among our people. Con-
sidering the families of UAW members
led to the establishment of summer
camp programs for children. Thousands
of youngsters have enjoyed a one- or
two-week camping experience at low
rates made possible by the nonprofit
operation of camps. Opportunities have
also been provided for daycamp expe-

riences. In the UAW Choral Group, a

newer interest and need is being met
by providing opportunity to express
and develop musical talent under skilled
and qualified leadership.

ONE OF the most active facets of op-
eration of the UAW has been its‘
retired workers program (see RECREA-f

TION, May 1958).

The growth of the program for senior
citizens has been amazing. More than:
thirty communities have programs in:
various stages of development. More‘
than thirty thousand retired workers
and their wives are participating in
either community-wide meetings, at--
tending special parties and functions or'
are engaging in the offering of the ac--
tivity centers. It is the activity centers
that are of particular concern to the
recreation department. Beginning with
such simple activities as playing cards-
and watching television, programs at:
the center have expanded to include
hobbies, educational and cultural ac-
tivities, counseling on personal prob-
lems, interpersonal relations, discussion
groUps, and the like. Stemming direct-
1y from the retired workers program
was the successful campaign in Detroit,

spearheaded by the UAW, to win re-

duced fare bus rates for senior citizens.

Today, there seems to be a real op-
portunity for our philosophy and'our
ideals to be made into a tangible entity
and to be placed within the grasp of
everyone. In binding together the
members of the great UAW family
through recreative activities, in coop-
erating with community and govern-
ment agencies, in planning for the fu-
ture and in making available programs
for all people, the UAW is contributing
its share towards the realization of this
practical effort. if:

 

Acting upon the recommendations
made in the recently published Albe-
marle Report, the British Government
is taking steps to increase the country’s
Youth Service leaders by financing the
establishment of an emergency training
college. Grants will also be provided
for an increase in workers’ salaries and

for expenditures of voluntary organiza-
tions so they may further their attempts
to attract more young people to use the
Youth Service.

The report deals with youth between
the ages of fourteen and twenty years,
examining employment and social diffi-
culties arising when young people leave

(4
school early and the problems of leisuréii
pursuits when they reach adulthood.1
Various recommendations are made forl
the improved cooperation between parki
and Youth Service authorities, to ex-!
tend recreation services and activitiesl
beyond the confines of the parks alone.

expected.

Concept of Behavioral Responsibility: We must interpret

' to teenagers what this thing called behavior is all about;

i

t

that with the desire for independence, each of us must also
accept responsibility; and the amount of independence
given should be dependent upon the willingness to accept
responsibility. Each of us must assume the responsibility
for the consequences that result from our behavior. In ef-
fect, the leader is not judging the teenager or the reasons
behind his behavior, but rather is pointing out to him the
results of his behavior. It is far easier for young people
to accept this concept than for them to feel bared of their

- inner feelings as to why they behaved as they did.

Concept of Authority: Among all of these concepts this is
perhaps the most controversial. It involves the use of law
enforcement authorities as a tool in dealing with behavior

problems. Immediately questions arise; such as these:
Should the police be called, and, if so, when? What will

i
H

k

l

the community feel towards the agency? Will the presence
of police cause a reduction in participation? Is the leader

relinquishing a responsibility rightfully his? There are also

countless other questions that can be added. From the par-
nts’ standpoint it can be threatening; from the leadership
oint of view it could appear to reflect failure or the in-
: bility for the worker to “reach ” troubled youth; and from
he agency’s outlook it may not be the most desirable situa-

tion in terms of public relations and community pressures.
Many young people have used these factors to their advan-
tage. Secure in the knowledge that an agency prohibits call-
ing the police, they can eiiectively begin to undermine the
program and hurl out the challenge that most workers can-
not accept, “Hit me!”

It is time for leaders at the policy-making, administrative,
and program levels to evaluate the gap between purpose and
practice. No leader ever needs to apologize because he can-
not do the job that rightfully belongs to a police ofhcer—nor
should he feel restrained to use whatever resources are avail-
able to show that he believes in law and order.

The value of this concept does not come from using the
police officer for every little incident, but from the knowl-
edge that the police can and will be called in to assist if the
situation warrants it. Equally important is the fact that
there will be unified support by the administration hacking
the leader’s decision.

ALTHOUGH THESE are not the only concepts that can con-

tribute towards a better understanding between teen-
ager's, agency, and community, they can serve as a guide,
especially to those centers who find themselves faced with
serious teenage problems. As a first step, professional and
lay leaders of youth-serving centers might do well to ask
themselves how many of these problems prevail merely
because they are permitted to exist.

The basic assumption from which these concepts were
derived is simple and brief. It is the sincere personal con-
viction that above everything else, a teenager intensely dis-
likes a leader who is afraid or a fool. Perhaps this one
thought alone is worth considering. #

maintenance costs. The manufacturer also produces other

ministrator should be, setting a good
example for your workers and partici-
pants, and providing needed equipment
for keeping the center clean and or-
derly?

2. Is good housekeeping a year-
round job in the center, rather than
'ust an occasional cleanup campaign?

3. Do you provide proper equipment
nd materials?

enter Lighting

vashing windows and other glass
reas?

5. Does your center have adequate
ighting, especially in craftrooms and

7. Have walls and ceilings been
ainted a color that reflects natural
ight but does not cause glare?

8. Are walls and ceilings cleaned as
ften as needed?

hen cleaning no longer restores their
ellecting value?

10. Do you provide a bulletin board

Your Publishing Problems

A brief survey of the publishing
problems of delegates at the 42nd Na-
tional Recreation Congress planning to
attend the Editor’s Luncheon was made
by Joe Davidson, superintendent of rec-
reation in White Plains, New York, and
editor of the New York Recreation So-
ciety bulletin, Empirec. He came up
with the following interesting list of the
problems and concerns that plague one
in the publishing of recreation mate-
rials:

1. How to successfully solicit worthy
and original articles from membership.

2. Selection of materials to meet var-
ied needs of membership.

3. Keeping membership aware of edi-
tor’s needs.

4. Need for professional editing.

5. Soliciting advertisers.

6. Securing money from advertisers.

7. Keeping advertisers when you only
have volunteer help.

8. Securing materials on time.

9. Time.
10. Overuse of “folksy” what-we-are-
doing material.
11. Securing articles of state-wide in-
terest.
12. Need for better printing.
13. Publishing materials on a regular
schedule.
14. Meeting copy deadlines.
15. Educating the membership to ac-
knowledge advertisement in publication
when making purchases.
16. Developing a complete list of publi-
cations in recreation and related fields.

Many thanks J 0e! Some of these will

be discussed at the Publications Work- '

shop at the Detroit Congress, October
1-6, 1961. If you have further sugges-
tions regarding such a workshop, please
send them to Z. Carol Pulcifer, General
Supervisor of Recreation, Municipal
Auditorium, Oakland, California.

National Recreation Month

The California town of Stockton de-
cided to kick off its celebration of
June as National Recreation Month
with a special dinner to honor recipi-
ents of National Recreation Association
awards. The Stockton Parks and Rec-
reation Department obtained use of the
Stockton College cafeteria, where it
served a roast beef dinner for 225 peo-
ple at the low cost of a dollar fifty per
person. Tickets were printed and sold
to individuals, groups, and organiza-
tions. Tables were decorated simply
with ivy and plaques bearing the em-
blems of such groups as Little League,
Girl Scouts, Babe Ruth, and the Camp
Fire Girls. The parks and recreation
department, in addition, arranged a dis-

play of its printed materials and maps
of parks and projects under way.

lier, NRA Pacific Southwest district
representative, to William Micke, donor
of a sixty-acre park to San Joaquin
County, and to the Downtown Lions.
Club of Stockton. A. J. “Bart” Dentoni,

tion Commission, acted as master of
ceremonies. Despite the 1070 heat, ev-

erybody had a line time. (See Page 30.)

Crawford H. Greenewalt, president
of E. I. duPont de Nemours 81 Co., is no
chaser after will-o-the wisps—~he has
spent seven years chasing humming-

 

birds. His project aptly illustrates how
rewarding to busy executives—or to
anybody for that matteru—a hobby can
become and where it can lead. In this
case, the result is a magnificent 250-
page book, titled Hummingbirds, lav-
ishly crammed with photographs taken
by the author on his many treks
through the western United States, the
Brazilian jungles, Ecuador, Cuba, and
Venezuela. Many of the birds photo-
graphed by Mr. Greenewalt have rarely
been seen before, much less snapped.
To facilitate getting pictures of these
fast-moving birds, Mr. Greenewalt and
several of his associates developed a
flash thirty-one millionths of a second
in duration. Mr. Greenewalt’s informa-
tion on the birds has substantiated prin-
ciples of aerodynamics that previously
were speculative and brightened new
theories of optics and coloration. A
special exhibit of his photographs and
artist Dale Astle’s drawings adapted
from them are on View through March
19 at the Museum of Natural History in
New York City. (The book is published
jointly by the museum and Doubleday
and Company for $22.50.)

RECREATION

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

'i‘ With the advent of the New Year,

it is time to review an emerging concept
of the role and objectives of recreation
for the ill and handicapped. When I
became the director of the National Rec-
reation Association Consulting Service
on Recreation for the Ill and Handi-
capped in 1953, my immediate sights
were set on promoting the use of rec-
reation as a preventive measure, a diag-
nostic tool, and a therapeutic agent in
helping hospitalized patients toward
health. Today, I am more than ever
aware of therapeutic recreation’s po-
tential for becoming a precision instru-
ment in the habilitation and rehabilita-
tion of the ill and handicapped.

This expanded view of the place of
’recreation in comprehensive habilita-'
tion and rehabilitation programs has
led me, regretfully, to resign as director
of the NRA Consulting Service on Rec-
reation for the Ill and Handicapped and
to establish a specialized organization,

Comeback, Inc. ( see also “As We Go
to Press,” Page 9). Comeback is dedi-
cated to serving the social rehabilitation
needs of the ill and handicapped. Al-
though the scope of Comeback’s opera-
tions will extend to every possible type
of service for social habilitation and
rehabilitation of the ill and handicap-
ped, recreation will continue to be an
area of major interest.

 
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
  

Comeback believes that therapeutic
recreation has a unique function in the
field of rehabilitation. Of all the pro-
fessional disciplines which contribute
to the comprehensive habilitation or re-
habilitation of an ill or handicapped
person, therapeutic recreation alone has
as its sole objective the provision of op-
portunities for optimum development
of the social-recreational skills which
help a person live a happy, useful, pro-
ductive life in an everchanging social
order. This is why Comeback, Inc. will
provide, among other services, consul-
tation and service in such key areas of
therapeutic recreation as research, dem-
onstration, education recruitment, ad-

ministration, and publication of infor-
mation.

Comeback’s board of directors and
'various committees are made up of
minent professionals in the field of re-

abilitation and distinguished citizens
rom all walks of life. Howard A. Rusk,

Playgrounds: Their Administration
and Operation, George D. Butler. Ron-
ald Press, 15 East 26th Street, New
York 10. Pp. 513. $7.00.*

From the prolific pen of George D.
Butler comes the third revised edition
of his basic reference on American
playgrounds. As director of research
for the National Recreation Associa-
tion, Mr. Butler has been a continuous
observer of playgrounds in America
over three decades and has collected a
wealth of knowledge of the American
neighborhood playground.

Playgrounds under professional lead-

ership in America now exceed twenty...

thousand and employees who adminis-
ter them and plan and supervise activi-
ties within them exceed one hundred
thousand. Volunteers enlisted as leaders
in municipal playground systems even
outnumber the employed personnel.
This large personnel can find no other
volume as comprehensive in its dealing
with neighborhood playground prob-
lems and tried-and-proven techniques.
The playground movement, having
doubled its growth each decade, has re-
quired three editions of Mr. Butler’s
book in the quarter-century since its
first publication. New plans, timely
adaptation of old techniques, and state-
ment of new methods of administration
need to be freshly set forth as they are
in this third edition.

The material falls into four catego-
ries: the physical plant which forms the
locale upon which neighborhood play is
practiced daily and seasonally; the pro-
fessional and volunteer personnel which
organizes and then directs, supervises,
and promotes the recreation activities;
the nature and organization of the ac-
tivity program; and the arrangements
for administration and effective opera-
tion. Experience of thousands of cities
is drawn upon and synthesized in the
volume which sets forth accepted prac-
two.

This work deals only with the neigh-
borhood playground, as operated in the
urban scene. There are, in the broad
sense, many kinds of playgrounds; for
example, those which serve communi-
ties consisting of a cluster of neighbor-
hoods; those which serve the people of

ciation Recreation Book Center, 8 W. 8th
New York 11.

50

a metropolitan area and which are lo-
cated some travel distance from the
communities of residence; and those
which serve only a given special activ-
ity. Just as neighborhood elementary
schools are the foundation of a complex
educational system, so are neighbor-
hood playgrounds the base upon which
the large structure of recreation serv-
ices is built. Playgrounds: Their Ad-
ministration and Operation is, there-
fore, a basic work which undergirds all
the literature on recreation organiza-
tion.

Institutions of higher learning which
offer courses for teachers, recreation
leaders, and groupworkers will find
this book a convenient text. Profes-
sional workers and volunteers, whether
serving as civic organizers of play-
grounds and playground systems or as
playground leaders will appreciate this
new edition as an up-to-date reference,
and will find its subject matter clearly
and logically presented. — George
H jelte, General Manager, Recreation

and Park Department, City of Los An-
geles.

This booklet was obviously writtel
by a craftsman because it wastes n
words. A series of some twenty-one dif

veloped in detail, each of slightly in
creasing difficulty. Instructions ar
clear, illustrated by simple sketches.

The projects are well-selected and ar
the types that are the most useful an
popular today. This useful but inex
pensive book should furnish new idea
for craft groups of all ages. Phot

Leisure in America, Max Kapla
John Wiley & Sons, 440 Park Avenu

view to defining major objectives in
realizing the vast potentials of our new
free time.

Although this is the work of a
professional sociologist, and technical
terms are used, any recreation worker
will find the book readable and perti-
nent. Dr. Kaplan not only gives us a
clear account of leisure as a vital factor
in our society but also a clear picture
Of the role of recreation as an impor-

Pioneers in Petticoats, Nellie Mc-
Caslin. Row, Peterson and Company,

linois. Pp. 205, illustrated. $2.00.*

Here is a collection of thirteen plays,
all as American as apple pie. Each play
uses a mixed cast, but the main charac-
ter is a girl or woman out of the pages
of American folklore or history. Most
of the plays take about twenty minutes,
none more than half an hour, even if
music is added; none require elaborate
sets or costumes. AH'use' a'narrator or
storyteller to bridge the gaps and clar-
ify the stories, thus making them also
very well-adapted for radio as well as
for the Stage.

Several are based on Indian legends,
several on early settlers and the Indi-
ans, several on the early days of the
Union (Betsy Ross and Dolly Madi-
son), and the remainder on mid- or
later nineteenth century (Harriet Bee-
,cher Stowe and Clara Barton among
lthem) . They are eminently suitable for
junior high school age, but most of
them could be used for slightly older or
slightly younger groups. The dialogues
are fresh and natural, and the author
has avoided any hackneyed plot. A re-
markably good collection!

 
 
   
 
    
    
   
    
 
  

Customs and Culture of Okinawa,
Gladys Zabilka. Charles E. Tuttle Com-
pany, Rutland, Vermont. Pp. 200, il-
lustrated. $2.75.

With recreation leaders constantly on
the alert for folk tales, music, dances,
and customs of other lands, books like
this become more and more useful.
hey are bridges to understanding as
vell as sources of new ideas for games,
rts, festivals, and other activities.

The author of this fascinating book
vas attached to the American Schools
in Okinawa as a music supervisor and
- il‘ector of the native culture program.
'ach year, as she tried to enlarge the
-chools’ cultural program to include
. ore knowledge and understanding of
he native arts, she ran across the lack
i any single source of information. To
ffset this, she collected material her-
elf, using all possible sources, and now
_resents us with an authoritative book.

skills, but they learn more slowly, and.

. they need to engage in recreation ac-‘

tivities at their own pace. When senior
citizens are accustomed tO participatingl
in recreation pursuits with their Ownt
age group, it is not difficult for them to-
take part in similar activities with
younger people. Mixing age groups has
its Own advantages for both young andl
Old, demonstrating to the elderly that
they are not isolated as a group andl
that they have not been pushed out Of'
community life.

Recreation activities cannot be forced -
upon older people, cannot be superim-
posed simply because it is good for'
them. If the activity is tO be truly bene-
ficial in effect, then it must be chosen,i
it must be wanted by the person partici-
pating.:1_‘_his is not to saydi’gyyever, that
the director or leader cannot tempt,
subtly persuade, or gently entice an
elderly person into an activity for which
he has little enthusiasm —-— and with
highly successful results. Each director

tailors his or her technique Of persua-

 
 
  
  
  
   
     
 
 
 
  
 
   
   
  
 
  
   
  
 
  
  
 
  
     
 

sion tO the individual involved.

All pioneers in new areas of behavior,
have an added responsibility for inter-
pretation and publicity. It is necessary
to interpret constantly tO the senior citi-
zens with whom we work the impor-
tance of recreation, tO make clear t
them that play is just as respectable an
dignified as work. Don’t forget, the
have spent the greater part of their lives
in a work-centered society that lOOke
on recreation as an indulgence or a
activity only for children. It is neces
sary to correct this misconception nO
only in the minds of residents or pa
tients, but also in the minds Of man
citizens in the community. As time al
lows, publicize the program throng
newspapers and other media Of com
munication, as well as through discus-
sions with community groups. Thi.
kind Of interpretation Often pays lar
dividends in the form Of financi
and / or volunteer assistance.

As you try new techniques in recrea
tion for the elderly, you will Undoubted
ly make valuable discoveries. Shar
your experiences with others in th
field. In this manner, progress will
achieved and all of us will benefit.
