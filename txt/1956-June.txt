Lifetime Construction, Unequaled Performance and Safety

RADICALLY DIFFERENT in design and
construction, unequaled 1n perform-
ance by any other board you’ve seen.

BUILT LIKE AN AIRPLANE WING-—
Aircraft structural design combined
with spring-leaf principle and heat-
tempered, specially alloyed aluminum
are joined in an assembly of great
strength, uniform flexibility and
incomparable springing qualities.

PRACTICALLY UNBREAKABLE — Many
times stronger than actual load re-
quirements—will withstand severest
use day after day, yet continue to
give unmatched performance and
maximum springing action year after
year, free of repairs or replacement.

SPRING-LEAF CONSTRUCTION gives
much greater strength at fulcrum
where needed, and lightness at tip.

RECREATION

The
First
Half

Century

the
Hardest

‘ Editorial 

A short lifetime ago——fifty years—the National Recreation Association was born, welcomed by
President Theodore Roosevelt at a White House meeting of the Association’s board of directors.
Twenty-five years later President Herbert Hoover again made the White House a sounding board
for the recreation needs of the American pe0ple by holding a meeting of the board of directors.

For fifty years the NRA has been a part of the persistent conscience of the American people,
whispering what ought to be. When the whispers went unheeded a little shouting cleared the
lungs.

The idea that play was a part of normal growth was then a novel idea. The NRA asserted that
city life was ill-suited for children. In the planning of our cities the children had been left out. I
was one of those children who tried to play football on an alley paved with cobblestones. I also
tried to roller skate on brick sidewalks. Then only a handful of cities provided playgrounds of
any sort; now there are few that do not. Then there were no trained play leaders; now the play
leader is a member of a respected profession taught by many colleges whose graduates make the
playgrounds hum.

Among NRA’s honored presidents was Joseph Lee, philosopher of play, who Wrote Play and
Education, John H. Finley, college president and editor of The New York Times, and Howard
Braucher, idealist turned executive, statesman in socialawork.

Joseph Lee, John Finley, and Howard Braucher left indelible impressions, not only on the
NRA but on their times. They, and many unknown soldiers in the ranks, have made it possible
for the NRA in its fiftieth year to strive with increasing success to make the profession of recrea-
tion leadership one of the most outstanding influences in the American way of life. By games,
sports, and carry-over skills in arts and crafts and other cultural interests, recreation leaders are
equal partners with school teachers in molding incentive and character. The NRA will always be
fighting the battles “of the recreation leader against political pressure and for the highest profes-
sional standards.

The ultimate strength of the National Recreation Association lies in the devotion and civic
Spirit of thousands of laymen and women on boards, committees, and foundations who steadily
hold the line and keep advancing it.

NRA’s F iftieth Anniversary is marked by three outstanding events: Our new home headquar—
ters, a building of charm and adequacy—the reconditioned former Whitney Art Museum—is in
full swing. The first nation—wide drive for resources to permit the NRA to meet ever-increasing
demands upon its staff, publications, and services is being planned. The final great event will be
the International Recreation Congress in Philadelphia, September 30 to October 5, the first in
twenty years and the most far-reaching ever attempted, with participants from many lands.

The NRA persuaded the International Educational Exchange Service of the State Department
to invite a number of recreation leaders from different countries. Fifty or more American com-
munities have been organized to receive these overseas leaders into their recreation and civic
lives for varying periodsu—weeks or months.

The International Recreation Congress has grown out of two missions undertaken by the
International Recreation Service of the NRA when Mr. and Mrs. Thomas E. Rivers visited thir-
teen countries in 1952, and twenty-two countries on a second trip in 1955.

We are fortunate to have Joseph Prendergast as executive director. His zeal, devotion, and
ability find a keen response in the enthusiastic cooperation of a staff second to that of no other
civic organization.

The workers of fifty years ago, including myself, did not foresee the scope, the widening hori-
zons of activities, or the potent influence NRA and recreation would come to wield. May the next
fifty years be even more fruitful in the pursuit of happiness, through a sound mind in a sound
body, both mind and body more and more engaged in creative leisure-time activities satisfying
to the deepest needs of men.

Chairman, National Recreation Association Board of Directors.

Do You Need Extras?

Sirs:

I should like to compliment you and
your staff on a most excellent play-
ground issue of RECREATION. I believe
it is the best such issue in my experi-
ence in the professional field. It is so
good, in fact, that I am ordering copies
for each of my twenty-two summer
playground workers.

Director, Geneva Youth Bureau,

Sirs:

Your April issue of RECREATION is a
real beauty. I’m sure you are getting
many fine comments on it, so let me
add mine too. The issue has a superb
balahce of recreation and playground
maintenance material, and it’s going to
sit on my desk for some time as an in-
spiration to pour over for ideas for han-
dling playground material for The
American City.

DOUGLAS 8. POWELL, Associate Edi-
tor, American City Magazine, New

York City.
A Rose Is A Rose

Sirs:

In “On The Campus,” in your April
issue, our football player is John Witte,
not John \Vhite, but a rose is a rose is
a rose.

A while back Jimmy Rogers spent
two days on the campus during which
time he addressed the professional rec-
reation majors, the regular meeting of
the Oregon State College section of the
AAlll’Ell, and a dinner meeting of the
combined physical education, health,
and recreation stalls of Oregon State
College and the University of Oregon.
llis trip was sponsored jointly by the
college and the AAllPER chapter.

“Only a Play Leader”

Sirs:

Who can ever forget Howard Brauch-
er’s editorial on "Mere Play”? The
phrase “only a play leader” is unfor-
gettable, and it is as timely now as it
was when first published, over two dec-
ades ago. I am delighted to see it re-
printed in the April issue. Braucher
had a very unique way of writing con-
cise, stimulating, and highly valuable
editorials—a rare gift.

The National Recreation Associa-
tion, of which he was foremost leader
for so many years, has done more than
any other organization to make Amer-
ica conscious of the importance of
wholesome recreation. Fifty years of
continuous service is indeed a great ac-
complishment. Congratulations!

~ MARTIN H. NEUMEYER, Head, De-

partment of Sociology, University

geles.

What’s In a Name?

Sirs:

Apropos of Mr. Charles Odegaard’s
letter, in the March issue, about stand-
ardization of names: while we are at
it, why don’t we also try to do some-
thing about a name for our profession
rather than a description of what we
do?

We call ourselves “recreation work-
er” or “recreation leader” or “recrea-
tion supervisor” or “recreation admin-
istrator,” but why not a single word
which everyone would come to recog-
nize as the label of the profession? Per-
haps a manufactured word would do
the trickr~—a word based on the word
“recreation” such as “recreationist”

or “recreationalist.” Undoubtedly it
would sound strange at first—but prob-
ably so did chemist or psychologist or
optometrist or all the other truly profes-
sional names that were so evolved and
which are now part of everyone’s vo-
cabulary.

We are not the only profession in this
situation, I know—witness the “social
worker” for example-—-but that is no
reason for not attempting to correct it.
We like to think of ourselves as a pro-
fession—why not do something about
getting a professional name? We don’t
call a teacher “an education worker”
or an attorney “a law worker”— why
do it in our Reld?

Perhaps this letter will “start the ball
rolling.” I’d like to see some comments
from the field in your columns.

M. C. THILTGEN, Superintendent,
Recreation Department, San Mateo,

California.

Further Congratulations

Among many thoughtful letters and
telegrams from organizations, muni-
cipal recreation departments, and in-
dividuals, congratulating the National
Recreation Association on its Golden
Anniversary are the following. We
wish we had the space in which to
share every one of them. However, we
herewith extend our sincere apprecia-
tion and thanks to all of our good
friends.

This Friday our thoughts turn back
to April 132 1906, when in Washington,
D. C., a galaxy of national leaders,
under the honorary presidency of the
President of the United States, brought
into being the Playground Association
of America. Fifty years have seen dra-
matic changes. It is as far from that
Playground Association to the present
National Recreation Association as it

is from the Republicanism of Teddy”

Roosevelt to that Of President Eisen-
hower.

Your history and ours are closely
linked in the colorful person of Dr.
Luther Halsey Gulick, founder of the
Association, and for thirteen years a
member of the faculty of Springfield
College. Since that day the interests
and activities of the new movement,
now known as the National Recreation
Association, and the college have been
intertwined, and we look forward to an-
other half-century of cooperation.

So it is with particular warmth that
we now congratulate you and the Na—
tional Recreation Association upon this
Golden Anniversary and wish you both
many long years of continuing public
service.——DONALD C. STONE, President,
Springfield College, Springfield, Mass.

for National Recreation Month and the
Golden Anniversary of the National
Recreation Association.

We know that Scouting for girls has
benefited‘through the years by the de-

the national level as fellow-members of
the National Social Welfare Assembly.

The contribution which the National
Recreation Association is making to the
welfare of the public gains in impor-
tance from year to year, as people of
all ages seek ways of using leisure time
that are both creative and rewarding.
We are most happy to eXpress the best
wishes of our entire membership for
many more years of useful service, and
to pledge our continued cooperation.—

The Playground and Recreation
Board of Decatur, Illinois, has asked
me to extend congratulations to the Na-
tional Recreation Association on its
Golden Anniversary, and also to wish
you well in your new home.

The Decatur Recreation Board has
many reasons to wish the National Rec-
reation Association well. The history
of Decatur shows that as far back as
1907, we have had relationship with
the Playground Association of America
and later, of course, the National Rec-
reation Association. Members of the
staff have done much to help us develop
the program that we have today.

Knowing so well what the National
Recreation Association has meant to
Decatur gives us a fair idea of the tre-
mendous amount of good that your As-
sociation has done throughout the
country and now the world.

All of us extend our greetings and
wish you continued success—RUSSELL
.l. FOVAL, Superintendent of Recrea-
tion, Decatur, Illinois.

Dedicatlon: To those thousands of people
from all walks of life who have contributed
in so many ways to the furthering of rec-
reation as a part of connnunity-lif e, we dedi-
cate this issue of RECREATION, on the Golden
Anniversary of the National Recreation

Association.

A New Crusade

As the National Recreation Associ-
ation begins its second half-century of
service, America is ready for a new
crusade for recreation. It is a crusade,
not by proclamation, but by the facts
and needs of the times. There are many
hundreds of communities with popula-
tions of iive thousand or more which
have not yet established the framework
for a community recreation program.
In the next few years these communi-
ties will be moving ahead. Recreation
is on the march. During last year alone,
more than one hundred communities
for the first time began year-round rec-
reation programs under professional
leadership.

We are in the midst of a crusade
which is bringing organized, planned,
community-sponsored recreation to
every community in the United States.
Your National Recreation Association
is pledged to give every possible sup-
port to this new movement.

But the campaign—the crusade, if
you will—must carry us far beyond the
initial establishment of new recreation
departments and organizations. We
must seek to lead the recreation move-
ment into a new quality of program,
of leadership, of facilities, of organiza-
tion. America needs and seeks new lei-
sure opportunities and experiences.
The time is now for all-out effort by
everyone in the recreation movement
to meet the challenge of the new leisure. 6.

The Age of Enjoyment

Our age hears many titles. To W. H.
Auden it is “the age of anxiety.” How-
ard Mumford Jones sees it as “the age
of violence”—-—one dark century of in-
creasing horror. Professor Arnold
Toynbee classifies it as “the age of mili-

258

tarism.” Winston Churchill calls it
“the age of coexistence”—or coextinc-
tion, as you prefer. Shannon and Weav-
er recognize our times as “the age of
automation,” rooted in a matured the-
ory of mathematical communication.
To J. Robert Oppenheimer we live in
“the age of the atom.” James B. Conant
sees us as standing on the threshold of
“the age of solar energy.” Russell Dav-
enport names our era as “the age of
fine phrases.” Aldous Huxley calls it
“the age of idolatries.” Our age has
been variously described as “the age
of apathy,” devoid of burning commit-
ments which once made life a crusade;
as “the age of the neurotic self”; as
“the age of faith,” with a return to the
church.

I propose our era as “the age of en-
joyment.” In the closing decades of
our century our pace quickens as we
advance toward the fulfillment of the
ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, the trinity of values once as-
serted only as philosophical goals in
the Declaration of Independence—DR.
PAUL F. DOUGLASS, in an address at the

L. H. Weir Recreation Banquet, April
1955, Indiana University.

Joseph Lee Speaks

On Space for Recreation: “The setting
aside of parks for camping and recrea-
tion generally is of vital importance
and will become vastly more so as
America becomes filled up. We ought
even, if necessary, to use for park and
beauty purposes land that could be used
for food.

“It is not a misfortune to Switzer-

land that the Lord or somebody has so
made their country that it is impossi-
ble to reduce it wholly to utilitarian
ends, though the railroads up the Jung-
frau, etc., are doing their best. The
greatest asset of mankind is the un-
conquerable sea. Some practical man
will some day come along to show how
it can be made to produce corn or oil
or some other means of living misera-
bly in an uninteresting world.”
On Recreation as Prevention: “Foot-
ball and similar dangerous sports give
expression to the fighting or knight-
errant instinct in every boy, turning
it into the proper channel instead of
leaving it overflow over the surround-
ing country. The alternative to a boy
in a playless world is break the law or
die, and t6 his everlasting credit he
chooses the former alternative.

“I do not believe, however, that the
main object of play is prevention of
lawlessness or of anything else. It is
the expression of the nature that the
Lord put into human beings, and its
function is positive.”-——From Private
Letters.

 

And To Those We Serve . . .

 

Edna Brancher has voiced the feelings of all friends of rec-
reation in her prayer written for the dedication of the National
Recreation Association’s new home. Wife of Howard Braacher,
late leader of the recreation movement and head of the National
RecreatiOn Association, Mrs. Braucher has contributed gener-
ously of her time and her services to the Association during his

Edna V. Brancher lifetime and since his death.

A Prayer

“0 Thou great Civer of every good and perfect gift, we thank Thee for this
moment of culmmatlon. We rejoice in the onward progress of our great move-
ment. May the sense of exaltation and dedication we feel today glow brightly
Withln us. May we in our new and beautiful surroundings be able to relate our-
selves ever more closely to the human needs of those we serve. May no machinery
or pattern of procedure dim in us the deep and abiding sense that we are workincr
for enlarged and satisfying life experience for our brothers. As we press forward
in this ploneer adventure of the human spirit, help us to see clearly and act nobly.”

RECREATION

 

* The American flag had only forty-five stars in 1906.

Probably the greatest news story of that year was the San
Francisco earthquake at 5:13 A.M. on April 18. Only a week
after the calamity the Boston Transcript could print these
lines:

“Some San Francisco folks intend
'This summer to foresake her;
Because the earth is not a Friend

Although it is a Quaker.”

Two days after the earthquake, bread sold for a dollar a
loaf in San Francisco—and wealthy citizens whose money
had been in banks were borrowing from those whose bank
was a pocket.

In New York, at the other end of the country and under
more normal conditions, strictly fresh eggs were seventeen
for a quarter and butter was twenty-three cents a pound.
The classified advertisements listed a six-room housekeep-
ing apartment on West 69th Street, furnished and with bath,
at ten dollars a week; or a nine-room steam-heated apart-
ment, also with bath, in a two-family house in Brookline,
Massachusetts, could be rented for thirty-live dollars a
month.

Grade school teachers in Boston received increases in sal-
aries that year by vote of the Peabody School Committee;
thereafter they were to receive up to a maximum of five-
hundred dollars a year. Neat “cash girls” were wanted in
New York department stores for three dollars a week with
one day off.

Four-cylinder Pope-Hartfords cost twenty-five hundred
dollars. This automobile “takes all the hills on the high
gear” and runs “five to fifty miles an hour on the level with-
out changing gears.” One person in eight hundred owned
a car—an Ardsley, Cadillac, Peerless, or Packard; a Stude-
baker, Oldsmobile or Pope-Hartford.

The Pennsylvania Railroad advertised “eighteen hours
from New York to Chicago.”

The “aeroplane” was three years old and already “the
problem of the century, mechanical flight,” was solved. The
Wrights had made one hundred and sixty flights, averaging
a mile each, and the machine had attained a speed of slightly
more than thirty-eight miles per hour.

The Literary Digest had an article about the effect of the

telephone 'on our American dialects. “The use of the tele- '

phone is bringing about greater similarity in different parts
of the country,” asserted the president of Southern Bell

Telephone and Telegraph Company.
The San Francisco Examiner for April 16, 1906, in a

front page story, reported telephone communication be-

JUNE 1956

tween that city and New York: “The long distance telephone
would seem to have been perfected.” Three days earlier the
mayors of San Francisco and Oakland were reported as
having exchanged wireless telegrams, the first such messages
transmitted between those cities.

The Ladies Home Journal carried an article by Jane Ad-
dams, “The First Five Years at Hull House.” M unsey’s Mag-
azine for September stated that “all told, New York City is
spending three hundred thousand dollars a year for school
playgrounds.”

In 1906 people were singing “Waltz Me Around Again
Willie,” “Forty-five Minutes from Broadway,” “The Good
Old Summer Time,” and “Everybody Works But Father.”

All three Barrymores were appearing on Broadway in the
same play, Sir James M. Barrie’s latest, Alice-Sit-by-the-
Fire. Charley’s Aunt, the “greatest of comedy‘successes,”
was playing; and there were The Girl of the Golden West
with Blanche Bates, George Washington, Jr. with George
M. Cohan, and Maude Adams in Peter Pan. (Maude Adams
was the favorite actress of Yale’s class of 1906, Ethel Bar-
rymore was second and Julia Marlowe was third.) Emma
Eames, Geraldine Farrar, Madam Schumann-Heink, and
Caruso were singing at the Metropolitan.

In Boston, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch was playing;
and the great Sarah Bernhardt was promised “late in the
season” for a single performance in one act from each of
four plays.

Dancing schools taught the glide-waltz, two-step, schot-
tische, polka, half-time, and lanciers. Fashions were affected
by the automobile—tourist coats had the “auto-cut”, were
made of silk and mohair of “dust-shedding qualities.”
Bathing suits could be had of either mohair or serge with
“high or open neck, sailor collar, and with bishop or short
sleeves.”

There was considerable speculation among editors in 1906
as to presidential candidates for 1908. “Who knows,” asked
the Washington Post, “that the exigency will not arise that
shall make it imperative for Mr. Roosevelt to enter the lists?
He was drafted in 1900. What has been, may be.” Begin-
ning in early 1906, George Harvey, editor of Harpers Week-
ly, carried on a vigorous campaign for Woodrow Wilson’s
nomination as the Democratic candidate for 1908.

President Theodore Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1906 for his success in bringing about peace
between Russia and Japan.

This was the general national scene when the Boston
Transcript for April 13, 1906, reported the formation, in
Washington, D.C., on April 12, of the Playground Associa-

tion of America. I

RAW MATERIAL FOR PLAYGROUNDS. Rubbish pile
is not a spot for children; but “where shall they play?”

THE NEED “to collect and distribute knowledge of and pro-
mote interest in playgrounds throughout the country,”
as brought to the attention of socially conscious citizens,
resulted in the birth of the Playground Association of Amer-
ica in Washington, DC. This purpose was so phrased in
the first draft of the Association’s constitution. City chil-
dren ivere playing in the streets in those days, in vacant lots,
railroad yards, on construction projects, or wherever they
could find an open space. Traffic accidents were high, and
the police were busy arresting young offenders. The big
problem before the new organization, then, was: “Where
shall they play?”

The idea of starting a playground organization had first
been suggested—by Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick of New York
City to Dr. Henry S. Curtis in November 1905; and it be-
came a reality just one year later. Even before this date,
steps had been taken toward providing play spaces for Amer-
ica’s children, and Joseph Lee—fighting for playgrounds
for the slum children of Boston—already had gone a long
way toward earning the title, “Godfather of Play.” As Clark
W. Helherington was to write in 1931, “Broadly speaking,
it is safe to say that previous to 1906 America had no posi—
tive philosOphy about the social or educational values of
play or recreation. There were recreation activities, but no
recreation ideals. . . .”

One of the first meetings of the new Association, arranged
by Charles F. Weller of Washington, D. C., was held with
President Theodore Roosevelt at the White House. Mr.
Roosevelt gave the organization his blessing, agreed to serve
as honorary president, and urged that in all its activities an
eflort he made to keep freedom for the children. (This he-

came a central theme in recreation thinking—“To make it
easy for each person to do what he likes best to do, to give
him a chance to find others with like interests”) Jacob Riis
of New York, nationally known crusader against slums,
agreed to serve as honorary vice-president.

At the first organization meeting, Dr. Guliek became pres-
ident, Dr. Curtis of New York, secretary and assistant treas-
urer, Henry B. F. Macfarland of Washington, first vice-pres-
ident, Jane Addams of Chicago, second vice-president,
Joseph Lee of Boston, third vice-president, and Felix War-
burg of New York, treasurer.

At that time, forty-one cities already were reporting play-
grounds under leadership. Today, an estimated twenty thou-
sand publiely-owned neighborhood playgrounds serve
millions of children, young pe0ple, and adults; 'while ap-
proximately twelve thousand indoor recreation centers and
buildings register total attendances of more than one hun-
dred and fifty million people throughout the year.

The first national Congress—the Chicago Play Congress
—was held in June 1907. THE PLAYGROUND, monthly
magazine which later would become RECREATION, was es-
tablished in April of that same year, and Joseph Lee wrote
in its first issue: “What is wanted on a playground is not the
teaching of baseball (it is diflicult to prevent a boy from
acquiring that accomplishment under any conditions), but
the influence of a man or woman of high character. Chil-
dren are very imitative; it is the incidental teaching by ex-
ample that counts, especially on the moral side, and nowhere
else does example count more than on the playground.”

Such leadership is now accepted as a must in recreation
and, comparatively, the wholesome use of leisure has be-
come a commonplace. It seems incredible, therefore, that
in 1907 contempt and derision was hurled at field repre-
sentatives of the Association when they advocated children’s

playgrounds. An example is the oft-quoted statement of a
congressman who, in questioning the appropriating of gov-
ernment money to teach children to play, said, “You might
as well try to teach fishes to swim as children to play.” As
a milepost of some fifty years of recreation progress, com-
pare this statement with one made in 1953 by Mayor Clark
of Philadelphia, “No elected official could . . . eliminate rec-
reation as a major function of local government and expect
re-election.”

To withstand these early misguided attitudes, the young
organization needed all the wisdom, skill, inspiration and
public backing which its pioneering leaders could bring to it.

However, from the moment of the first meeting of that
staunch little grOUp of visionary citizens in Washington, out-
standing leadership was at hand. It was fortunate in having
Dr. Gulick at the helm. He had made a study of play and
had become deeply convinced of its significance as a social
force and in education.

The Russell Sage Foundation became interested in the new
Association at this time and, through the sympathetic un-
derstanding of Robert W. de Forest, gave it a great deal of
help. In November, 1907, the foundation loaned Lee F.
Hanmer to serve as the Association’s first field secretary.
As he traveled from city to city in the interests of play-
grounds and recreation, he acquired the nickname of “The
Playground Drummer.”

Later, the Association was again fortunate in having as
its president Joseph Lee, who knew play not only as aphi-
losopher but as a practical social worker, and Howard
Braucher as its executive secretary, and finally its president.
These two leaders were greatly responsible for the Associa-
tion’s high moral quality, intellectual earnestness, and social
insight.

When Howard Braucher became the infant association’s

first paid secretary in 1909, he did so on the proviso that it
become the spearhead of “a nation-wide movement to bring
broad recreation opportunities to all the pe0ple, regardless
of age, sex, religious faiths.” This objective was incorpo-
rated in the organization’s purpose, and was to be Mr.
Braucher’s guiding principle throughout the years.

In its first program, largely educational, the Association
undertook to interpret to the American public the then un-
recognized need for a trained professional group of men and
women with freedom to organize and administer play and
recreation on a community basis. This was a type of worker
distinct from the teacher, park administrator, and social
worker.

From that day on, the discovery, employment, guidance
and serving of this professional group has engaged much
of the Association’s attention and constitutes one of its
unique and outstanding services to America. The public rec-
reation superintendent, the playground director, and the
play leader are a distinctly American product and, more
specifically, a product of National Recreation Association.

Rapid Growth

It was necessary to add new services steadily to meet the
demands of a growing program. The field services to com-
munities were the first, of course. There followed many
others, among them consultation service, short-term inten-
sive training institutes, a drama service, music, pllysical edu-
cation, field service in relation to park departments, the Na-
tional Recreation School, field service on recreation and
athletics for women and girls, the promotion of play in in-
stitutions, four-week institutes in major cities, nature and
gardening services, service in the planning of recreation fa-
cilities and areas.

The history of the Association is the story of an agency
broadening and adapting its work to the swiftly changing
American scene. The very alterations in its name—from
Playground Association to Playground and Recreation As-
sociation in May 1911, and finally to National Recreation
Association in June 1930—record an evolution from a chil-
dren’s playground movement to a broad service to adults

and children; and the final establishment, in 1953, of its
International Recreation Service indicates the steady expan-
sion of its horizons.

Its purpose was officially restated in 1950 as follows: “To
assure every child in America of a place to play in safety
and every person, young and old, an opportunity to find the
best, and most satisfying use of his expanding leisure time.”

This growth has not been without its difliculties; one prob-
lem, from the very beginning, has been the grip of commer-
cialized amusement on the American people; another, the
puritanical scorn of play, or the glorification of work.

Also obstacles to the work of the Association have been
the growing congestion of cities and the unrestrained land
exploitation during the era of industrial expansion. City
planning, including recreation planning, in the United States
was so laggard in the early days that vast urban areas were
filled solid, making the price for land for playgrounds and
parks in the older sections of cities practically prohibitive.
Even today, the great burning problem in the recreation
field is land.

Two World Wars increased the responsibilities of the
Association. During the first it established the War Camp
Community Service program, a service which the govern-
ment recognized as notably successful. Some of its by-
products werc: increased attention to the recreation of
adults; more emphasis on community music, drama, art,
crafts, and community recreation buildings. During World
War ll, its knowledge, experience, and leadership were again
made available to and used by the federal government.

What happened in public recreation during the depression
years is further proof of the soundness of the recreation
movement. rl'he government threw men and money into the
construction of recreation facilities, connnunity leadership
and instruction. The Works Progress (later the Work Proj-
ects) Administration constructed thousands of playgrounds,
athletic fields, swimming facilities, picnic areas, winter sport,
and other facilities, among them 2,078 new playgrounds.
This federal agency had 41,780 individuals, or 1.7 per cent

of its total personnel. employed as recreation leaders in June

1939.
262

Interest in recreation spread accordingly, and the demand
for voluntary and paid leadership beCame very great. To-
day, this demand far exceeds the number of available trained
personnel. Recreation major courses have been established
in many of our leading universities and colleges, with the
awarding of graduate and postgraduate degrees in recrea-
tion. This current demand for trained leaders was dramatic-
ally pointed up in Recreation As a Profession in the South-
ern Region, a study conducted by the Personnel Service staff
of the Association, published in 1955.

In the first years, leaders of the Russell Sage Foundation
had pointed out that the Association should develop its own
financial support. The organization and the recreation
movement will be forever grateful to those men and women
who had the vision and courage to ask for the funds which
have made possible the results achieved.

The Association now has over 18,000 contributors. Four
new types of service memberships in the Association have
been established since the arrival of Joseph Prendergast as
executive director, in 1950. They are: ajfiliate, for recrea-
tion departments and organizations; active associate, for
individuals who work in the recreation field; student associ-
ate, for students taking recreation courses, and student apili-
ate, for student groups.

New also are the eight District Advisory Committees and
the eight National Advisory Committees. The National Ad-
visory Council heads up these extremely helpful and valuable
groups of professional recreation leaders who represent an
important pooling of c00perative effort by those on the firing
line and the Association.

One of the things which make the National Recreation
Association an unique organization is its work with lay citi-
zens in the provision of local community recreation serv-
ices. Community leaders can associate with it for service.
A special program for honorary citations to be awarded to
outstanding lay contributors to the recreation movement
which has just been instituted by the Board of Directors as
a part of the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration, is described
in the article, “National Recreation Month,” on page 274.

City planning which, up to the twentieth century, was
largely concerned with street systems, now examines every
phase of community life and increasingly includes planning
for recreation areas and facilities. The Survey and Plan-
ning Service of the Association is challenged by an ever-in-
creasing number of requests for service.

Other changes in recreation, through the years, have
brought a greater concern for the individual participant in
recreation activities, more small group activities rather than
large, recreation for the elderly and for persons in hospitals,
prisons, and other institutions. Churches are outgrowing
the old idea that play is sin and establishing interesting rec-
reation programs for all ages. It is a vital factor in giving
America’s mounting population of senior citizens a greater

source of dignity, worth, and happiness.

And there has come about a greater understanding of the
importance of recreation to many things: to mental and phy-
sical health; to an enrichment of living, and the develop-
ment of the human being; to the training of future citizens;
to international understanding; and to the fulfillment of our

basic human needs. Recreation, in other words, is becoming
recognized as an important part of life. As Howard Braucher
said: “Recreation, like education, is for all men everywhere,
from the cradle to the grave. It is not merely for those who
have suffered misfortune. It is to give to all opportunity for
growth, opportunity to be and become themselves. . . . The
recreation movement is a movement for the centuries and
not just for today and tomorrow. It belongs to and is a part
of religion, education, industry, social work, health move-
ments, prevention of crime movements, character building,

citizenship movements———yet it belongs exclusively to no one
of these for it is in itself one side of life.”

The remarkable pr0phetic vision of the founders of what
is now the National Recreation Association has proven it-
self, and still provides a firm foundation for recreation in
the new era of automation and the startling increase,of lei-
sure time for everyone. The valuable contribution of the
recreation movement during the next fifty. years to American
life and culture offers a challenge as great or possibly greater
than that envisioned by the Association’s founding fathers. I

After fifty years of service the National Recreation Association welcomes this occasion to ex-
press its sincere appreciation of, and acknowledge its debt to, the men and women  vision who
laid its foundation of spiritual and physical strength, and to those who have contributed to it in
various forms and believed in it through the last half-century. In the following mention of

a specijic few, we salute the many.

To the Early Leaders—

]oseph Lee, who cared far more about people than about
himself. He studied characteristics and needs of boys and
girls, developed a play philos0phy and put his thoughts
down on the printed page before most people were even
aware that there was any problem. He served as beloved
leader of the Association for twenty-seven years.

Jacob Riis, who had done much thinking about the impor-
tance of play. As a New York newspaper reporter, destined
to become one of America’s foremost humanitarians, he
recognized the crying need for play space, and was glad to
endorse the work and objectives of the new Association.
Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, who
had spent much of his life in outdoor activity and was the
country’s most ardent advocate of the vigorous outdoor life.
At just the right time he was ready to become active and
vocal in behalf of recreation. Great impetus was given to
the whole movement when he addressed a letter to the
mayors of all the principal cities, inviting each to send a
delegate to the first recreation congress in Chicago.

Jane Addams, who had been giving herself for years to the
welfare and happiness of underprivileged families at Hull
House, Chicago. She, too, was an earnest student of the
social and recreation needs of boys and girls and young
people. Her experience, her background, and her wonder-
ful spirit gave her the qualities needed to help guide the
young Association.

Dr. Luther Halsey Culick, who was one of the foremost stu-
dents and teachers of his time in physical training, and was
one of the first to recognize the character-building signili-
cance of play. '

Lee F. Hanmer, who had been a teacher and an athlete at
Cornell, and became a serious student of social conditions
and a specialist in recreation. He also was alliliated with
the Russell Sage Foundation through its Playground Ex-
tension Committee, and became the first field representative
of the Association.

Dr. Seth Thayer Stewart, who was district superintendent
of schools in New York City, and who thought of the school
system as a social laboratory for the adjustment of young
citizens to their environment. He thus came to appreciate
the great contribution the recreation center and the play-

ground could make to the welfare and happiness of youth.
Dr. Henry S. Curtis, trained in physical education, who be-
came assistant director of playgrounds in New York City

.in the late nineties. In that position he became convinced

of the need for organized training for playground workers.
Through his persistence in attempting to find a way to make
such training possible, there came a chain of developments
which resulted in the creation of the Playground Associa-
tion of America.

.,_0

Charles E. Weller, an Associated Charities executive in
Washington, who knew the social needs of children and
young people. He had opened the first playground in the
nation’s capital and was immediately sympathetic to the
ideas of Dr. Curtis.

Dr. Clark W. Hetherington, outstanding leader in the rec-
reational aspect of physical education and fully cognizant
of the need for training in the field of recreation.

There were many other contemporary persons who gave
liberally of themselves and their talents to assist the new
recreation movement, such as: Dr. George E. Johnson of
the Playground Association in Pittsburgh, whose Why
Teach A Child to Play is still widely used; the Honorable
Charles Evans Hughes, whose address on “Why We Want
Playgrounds,” delivered in 1908, is still a valuable state-
ment; Allen T. Buins, who contributed some of the iirst
written statements on the relation of playgrounds to uvenile
delinquency; Edward B. DeCroot, who helped launch the
South Park System in Chicago; Mary McDowell, one of
the prime movers in the Playground Association of Chi-
cago; and James Edward Rogers who was very active on
the Pacific Coast in helping to start some of the earliest
recreation departments. Felix M. Warburg, William Ham-
lin Childs, James C. Phelps Stokes, Jessie Bancroft and
Mrs. Mary Kingsbury Simhhovitch, a pioneer settlement
worker in New York, were among those who were very
active during the Association’s first year.

Howard Braucher, who had not yet reached his twenty-fifth
birthday when the Association was founded, was interested
from the beginning in the organization’s purposes and
ideals. Trained for the ministry and for social work, in
which he was active at Portland, Maine, he traveled to a
number of cities as a volunteer to study the new movement.
In 1909 he was elected secretary of the Association to sue-
ceed Dr. Curtis. Mr. Braucher’s attitude toward the work
was spiritual and religious. His leadership was inspirational.

To the Sponsors and Board Members—

That magnificent body of men and women whose support
has made possible the work of the Association through all
of these years. The growth of the Association and its na-
tional standing today are in a very large measure due to
the devotion of board members, honorary members, and
sponsors who have been willing to help raise the funds so
necessary to the Association’s program of service.

The current members of the Association’s Board of Direc-
tors are shown on page 266. Since 1906, there have been
171 other nationally prominent men and women who have
served the Association and the recreation movement as
‘members of the board. Otto T. Mallery, current chairman,
has been in office for five years, a member of the board since
1912, and has devoted a lifetime of service to the cause of
recreation.

Some years as many as 18,000 men and women, corpo-
rations, agencies, and foundations have made contributions
to the National Recreation Association. These gifts have
come in all sizes. The great and inspiring thing about it all
is that they continue to come. Why? Because of the capac-
ity and devotion of that very select group known as “spon-
sors.” Sponsors are leaders who are willing to ask others
in their communities for contributions to the Association.
There are at present 450 sponsors throughout the country.

Some of the outstanding men and women of the country
have been willing to serve the Association. In city after
city through the years sponsors have been leading bankers,
attorneys, doctors, industrialists, judges, public. officials,
educators, and women of social and civic prominence. The
late President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the late John C.
Winant were former sponsors of the Association.

The number of individuals who have served in this capac-
ity is so large that the thousands of names cannot be listed

RECREATION

A Prelude to the Future

The -

Challenge of Today’s Leisure

HE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY of the

National Recreation Association
coincides with the approximate begin-
ning of what is being described by
many as the second industrial revolu-
tion. No exact date pinpoints its start,
but it is worth noting that we only be-
gan to hear about automation approxi-
mately eight years ago, and that atomic
energy has only recently become a
household phrase.

It is most appropriate that this anni-
versary comes at a time when America
is on the verge of reaching higher goals
of material wealth and security than
ever before. Already it is evident that
another significant result of this new
technology will be greater leisure for
all people.

To get the most out of leisure living,
the individual needs to have oppor-
tunity to choose from a wide range of
recreation activities. This individual
choice is determined in large part by
the quantity and quality of recreation
leadership, organization, and the land
available in the community.

The responsibility of the community
for the organization of land for recre-
ation cannot be overemphasized. It is
possible to postpone decisions on whe-
ther or not to add new programs of
instruction in baseball, swimming, or
golf, for instance; but the setting
aside of lands for golf courses, play-
grounds, parks, athletic fields, boating
facilities, and all of the other badly
needed recreation areas and facilities
cannot be postponed. If we hesitate for
long, open space becomes housing de-
veIOpments, fact0ries, or throughways.

Bold and decisive local leadership
needs to tackle this problem immedi-

ately in almost every community in the
country. Far too many recreation of-
ficials have set their sights for land far
too low because they underestimate the
intelligence, foresight, and understand-
ing of the average citizen. There is en-
tirely too much settling for less-than-
standard because of a fear that commu-
nities are not “ready” for recreation.
We still have a long way to go before
community planning for recreation
reaches the status needed for an age of
automation. But the people of many
communities are ready to go much
farther now in meeting their recreation
needs than is often realized.

Recreation leadership also needs the
immediate attention of both the recre-
ation profession and the citizenileader
in the community. There will need to
be countless more skilled and trained
leaders as administrators, supervisors,
and activity leaders in the new and ex-
panding programs. In addition, there
will need to be community recreation
executives who can function as commu-
nity executive secretaries for the count-
less number of volunteer recreation

groups and organizations.

needed will be the recreation counselor
who can give individual guidance for
leisure living just as a guidance coun-
selor now does in the vocational field.

There is also need for the type of
citizen leadership which gives expres-
sion to the interests and needs of the
people and sees that they are realized.
Although recreation is achieving insti-
tutional statusin the community as an
official tax-supported function, continu-
ing citizen interest, advice, and counsel
must be encouraged.

Recreation must be a grass-roots pro-
gram to be effective. Official and ad-
visory recreation and park boards and

commissions are indispensable. But,
beyond this, there needs to be citizen
organizations to keep recreation pro-
grams closely related to the changing
and growing recreation needs of all of
the people.

The experiences in the field of edu-
cation offer an interesting comparison.
Although school boards of citizens ad-
minister the public school, communica-
tion between the public and the schools
has been termed largely inadequate by
the recent White House Conference on
Education. At the conference, the dis-
cussion on how to improve public inter-
est in education urged a wider- use of
citizen advisory groups as well as ex-
panded public information programs.

One of the great values of the Na-
tional Recreation Association is its
bringing together in a single organiza-
tion both professional recreation lead-
ers and citizens interested in the de-
velopment of the recreation movement.
In the, years ahead this blending of the
two kinds of leadership will continue to
keep the recreation movement a peo-
ple’s movement.

Whenever more than one person is
involved in a recreation activity some
organization—of an informal nature,
at least—is involved. And in order to

lands and buildings for the people of
an entire community a great deal of
formal organization is absolutely nec-
essary. An awareness of the importance
of recreation organization will grow as
we move farther into the age of auto-
mation. Hospitals, schools, churches,
industry, the armed forces and the com-
munity all must have organizations so
that the individual will have the frame-
work through which he can fulfill his
leisure needs.

The first objective in every commu-

267

nity is for a recreation department con-
cerned with community-wide needs for
recreation. Last year there were more
than one hundred communities which
established such departments for the
first time. Out of a total of 2,438 com-
munities of over 5,000 population there
are now 1,252 municipalities with pub-
lic recreation agencies providing serv-
ices twelve months a year. Hundreds
more have part-time programs.

As important as are land, leaders,
and organization as recreation re-
sources, they do not by themselves pro-
vide all the elements needed to meet the
challenge of the new leisure created by
automation and atomic energy. How
the American people use their new lei-
sure—and this is really what constitutes
the challenge—will be determined also
by their attitudes toward leisure and
by their leisure skills and knowledges.

One of the great values of being old
enough to have a history is that the ex-
periences and knowledge of the past
can often throw new light on the prob-
lems of the present. The importance of
leisure attitudes and leisure skills were

recognized quite a number of years ago
by one of the great leaders in the recre-
tion movement, my predecessor as ex-
ecutive director of the National Recre-
ation Association, Howard Braucher.

Twenty-two years ago, Mr. Braucher
wrote in an editorial for RECREATION
Magazine about a basic American at-
titude concerning work which was bold-
ing back the whole recreation move-
ment from its greatest contribution to
human welfare. America is in the proc-
ess now of re-evaluating its attitudes
toward leisure, recreation, play, and
work. More leisure, more personal in-
come, and increased education are cre-
ating a new climate of public Opinion,
new attitudes favorable to recreation.
Community recreation leadership must
help shape these new attitudes so that
they will provide the framework within
which individuals can truly enjoy a
freedom to live.

One of the lessons profit-making or-
ganizations have learned over a period
of years ,is that America’s tastes and
skills are constantly improving. In spite
of the head-shakers and nay-sayers, the
level of education, cultural taste, and
leisure skills is constantly going up.

While some may want to bring back
the “good old days” when people were
more amateurish about their recreation
activities, the fact is that more and
more people are becoming experts at a
great many kinds of non-working ac-
tivities. As pe0ple become more skill-

ed at recreation they demand quality
programs and opportunities. They will
not accept shoddy and inferior activi-
ties and experiences for themselves or
their children.

Leaders in the recreation movement
would do well to look to the future with
an eye on one of the planks in the Fun-
damentals in Community Recreation
platform developed a number of years
ago by the National Recreation Asso-
ciation in cooperation with recreation
officials and That plank
reads: “That the emphasis [of commu-
nity recreation] ought to be not only

on maintaining certain activities on
playgrounds and in recreation centers,
but also and definitely on the training
of the entire people in leisure-time ac-
tivities, so that within the home, in the
church and throughout all natural,
human relationships there shall be the
best opportunity for wholesome good
times.”

Planned programs of recreation edu-
cation, not only formally in the class-
room, but through informal programs
in the community will be an important
need in the years ahead.

The “challenge of leisure—~—-1956” is
a far cry from the “challenge of leisure
—1906.” The need then involved how
and where children would spend their
free time. The need now concerns all
people, of all ages, and reaches deep
into the complexities of human rela-
tions and individual growth. I

RECREATION

Philosophies Upon Which We Built

_Wo¢oroMWJWWJoom.—__

Play

AGREAT obstacle in interpreting the child to grown people
is that we have no word which stands for the most im-
portant factor in the child’s life. And the difficulty is en-
hanced by the fact that the word which we actually use to
designate this factor has a significance almost diametrically
opposed to the nature of the thing itself and helps continually
to mislead us upon the subject. “Play,” to grown people,
signifies something of secondary importance: it is the word
for those activities that must be postponed to serious pur-
suits. . . . “Child’s play,” especially, means whatever is
ridiculously easy. To the child, upon the other hand, play
is the most important thing there is. It is primary, comes
first in interest, represents real life; it is what all the rest
is for. It is difficult, making an infinite and insatiable de-
mand for power and courage. It is authoritative, required,
not to be slighted without shame. Play is the child. In it he
wreaks himself. It is the letting loose of what is in him, the
active projection of the force he is, the becoming of what he
is to be.

And not only do we call the child’s dearest interests by a
name implying that they are of negligible importance, but
we heighten the misunderstanding by (very properly) call-
ing the same identical interests when they appear in grown
people by a variety of high-sounding names—such as work,
art, science, patriotism, idealism, genius—that we never
think of applying to children’s play. . . .

In these various ways we have obscured to ourselves the
truth—in any case difficult to perceive from our standpoint
-—-—that children’s play and the highest expressions of our
grown-up life are in very truth the same.

Play is Serious '

It is the supreme seriousness of play that gives it its edu-
cational importance. Education, as we have all learned, is
not simply' a matter of accumulating knowledge. We are
now learning the further truth, which Froebel taught, that
it is not even a matter of acquiring power, of training the
muscles and the mind. We aim to develop power; we train
the muscles and the mind; but we are no longer content un-
less these serve as avenues to something deeper. The ques-
tion is not of learning, nor yet of power, but of character.
If the lesson has struck home, the result is not merely more
knowledge or more intelligence, but more boy or girl‘—more
of a person there for all purposes. If his arithmetic has truly
reached him, he will play better football; if his football has
been the real thing, he will do better at arithmetic. That is
the test of a true educational experience—-——that it leaves a
larger personality behind. . . . It is only what you put the
whole of yourself into that will give you a greater self in
return.

This characteristic of the true educational experience is
possessed by play and, to the full extent, by play alone. It is

JUNE 1956

only in his play that the child’s whole power is called forth,
that he gets himself entirely into what he does. . . . Play is
like a chemical reaction; in it the child’s nature leaps out
toward its own and takes possession.-——JOSEPH LEE, in Play

and Education.

A Discovery as Important

as the Use of Atomic Energy

MAKING use of the power of the atom is a great achieve-
ment in the physical world. We cannot tell where this
may lead.

An equally great discovery of our times is the power there
is in recreation in making it possible and easy for all people
to live richly, deeply, vitally, each day. . . .

In the home and in the neighborhood where there is alive-
ness to . . . the joy of doing many things together, where the
recreation way of life prevails, where each person finds it
possible to be the man his inner nature demands, then man
is more fully man and so many of the ills of society fall
away. . . .

Build life strong through recreation and you help to lessen
poor physical and mental health, delinquency and crime and
much of ill will. But, if instead of thinking of building life
itself you start out merely to work consciously for lessening
crime and insanity, you are apt to lose out in your objective.
That which is lost if sought directly may be had if it is not
sought. The bluebird easily flies away.

This is the law of the world which we the people have dis-
covered for ourselves—Give us strong, permanently satisfy-
ing daily life, give us daily opportunity for growth through
activity we ourselves have chosen, help us each day to have
freedom to do the things that belong to complete manhood
-—-—do this and most other things shall be added unto us.

In the spiritual world the discovery of recreation, of the
recreative way of life, is as great a discovery as electricity,
as potent as the finding of the power of the atom in the phy—
sical realm.

Man cannot live by machinery alone. When men ask for
warm human living shall we give them machinery?

. . . It is in our power now, under God, through the re-
creative way of life to develop such living in our homes and
in our neighborhoods that we all may feel that we live on
holy ground, that many shrubs about us are burning bushes,
that the land of heart’s desire is not something far off, that
all who share a common beauty are brothers, that all who
have learned to share common activity with little money and
little price are part of a very great democracy.

It is everlastingly important to build this way of daily
living.

The power of the atom is such that we may have little time
for building the greatest of all democracieshdemocracy in
living itself.—HOWARD BRAUCHER, in A Treasury of Living.

“Handfuls front Home”

This was the name of a unique ceremony held recently at
the newest park site in San Leandro, California. Prompted
by the need for nine thousand cubic yards of soil to fill a
future recreation area to proper grade, the ceremony was
planned so that the children from James Madison School,
which adjoins the new five-acre Bonaire Park site, might
deposit dirt which they had carried from home. A sugges-
tion by Rex Tussing, editor of the San Leandro Morning
News, started the ball rolling when he wrote:

“The City of San Leandro has set aside a park area next
to James Madison School in the Bonaire community. But the
land is sunken and low, soggy, and fills with water in winter-
time. _We would like to see the children of Madison School,
all of them, some day soon bring to school a little package
of soil from their own backyards.

“If those hundreds of packages of home soil are then
mixed with the alien heaps brought in by truck and bull-
dozer, the hundreds of handfuls from home can have a won-
derful cflect on all the children and all their families. The
park, the playground, will become their own possession, an
extension of their own homes, part of their lives. The park
will belong to the children and the children belong to the
park. No other act could so truly make it a community park.
And they will feel, ‘This is my land, and I will care for it, and
protect it, and help it.’

School children assemble at the park site with hundreds
of little packages of soil—their“handfuls from home.”

These instances are typical of exciting commu-
nity “do-it-yourself” activities which are stirring
throughout the country. They are the fruits of suc-
cessful over-all interpretation of recreation needs,
and auger well for the challenging years ahead.

“And for their whole lifetime, they will remember that
they helped create a park, and that park was theirs and
always will be theirs, wherever they may later wander. And
in their adult lives they, too, will help provide for their chil-
dren and the future.”

Principal Loyce L. McCormick and the children of Madi-

son School were quick to act upon this suggestion. In a few
days the entire enrollment of the school marched to the ad-
joining park site. At the given signal, .sacks of dirt were
emptied, each child having brought from home his small
contribution—both a real and a symbolic one—to the com-
pletion of the new recreation area.

On the heels of this event, and inspired by it, other con-
tributions of soil were made, some large, some small. Con-
tractors working in the area delivered it in truckloads.
Others, impressed by the keen desire of the community for
early completion of the park, added their hit. When the
county of Alameda broke ground for a new branch court
house, for instance, a sack of dirt for the park was collected
and delivered personally by Francis Dunn of the county
board of supervisors. The procedure has been repeated at
recent ground-breaking ceremonies for industrial plants;

and many residents of the area have added their deposits of
dirt by the truckload, sackful, and trailerload.

Spurred on by such interest in the project, a volunteer

“Operation Brush-Off”

More than forty-nve acres of land were cleared by vol-
unteer workers on a Saturday last spring as Bellingham’s
community project, “Operation Brush-Off.” Sponsored by
the Bellingham Junior Chamber of Commerce, this project
proved to be a tremendous success. Volunteers were helping
clear theland for a new seventy-acre athletic field. The What-
com County loggers, Bellingham Junior Chamber of Com-
merce members, Park Department employees and citizen
volunteers teamed up some one hundred and fifty strong for
the clearing and grubbing. A saving to the city of between
$10,000 and $15,000 was estimated. Altogether, close to
$650,000 in volunteer equipment and manpower was repre-
sented at this operation.

At this time the brush was too damp for burning and the
piles of slash were left until late summer to permit thorough
drying. Five tons of rubber tires and about three tons of
sawdust were distributed throughout the area, near slash
piles, to be used in the final burning. Of the remaining acre-
age in the athletic field, some ten acres were covered by
evergreens and did not need clearing in the immediate fu-
ture. The remaining acreage was already clear. Work on
the survey could begin immediately.——HERBERT J. OLSON,
Superintendent of Parks, Bellingham, Washington.

Neshaminy Valley Youth Center

The organizations of our small town (Newton, Pennsyl-

vania, pOpulation approximately twenty-two hundred) be- 0

came concerned about the mounting crime wave throughout
the country and wanted to do something for the local teen-
agers. The only recreation facilities outside of school were
churches, movies, a bowling alley, and pool room. The
guidance teacher from the high school was chosen to be in
charge of the preliminary arrangements. She was aided by
the backing of the principal and a spirited high school group.
An enthusiastic assembly of adults who were also determined
to be of help included representatives of the following local
organizations: League of Women Voters, women’s clubs,
American Legion, Legion Auxiliary, Council of Churches,
Exchange Club, PTA, Newton Fire Company, and St. An-
drew’s Parish. A retired business executive was eventually
persuaded to head the entire program.

The American Legion rooms were offered for meetings 011
Monday nights. Plans were made for a youth center, and a
name was chosen. Many good times were had there, but the
rooms soon proved too small and neighbors were upset by
the unusual gathering of large numbers of young people;

so another place had to be found. This was accomplished
through the generosity of an old Newton family, who agreed
to let us use a large building which had been standing vacant
in the center of town. Funds needed to put it into working
shape were raised—$25,000 in all—through a concentrated
drive by the now large group who were backing the pro-
gram. This was started off with a torchlight parade to the
ballgrounds where Paul Whiteman and Ezra Stone, of
“Henry Aldrich” fame, were guest speakers. A house-to-
house canvass was also part of the campaign, all money being
raised through contributions.

After the new quarters were remodeled the problem of
leadership arose. Various plans failed and it was finally de-
cided that only a trained, experienced director would suc-
ceed. Now a capable man with several years of YMCA work
is in charge. There are hobby groups, hay rides, cookouts,
roller-skating parties, swimming instruction, fencing, and
archery. In summer there is a day camp. The center is now
a beneficiary of the Bucks County Community Chest and re-
ceives donations from individuals as well as from the New-
ton Welfare Council and from membership dues. The cen-
ter is increasingly accepted and used by adults as well as by
youngsters—MRS. ROLAND W. PORTER, Newton, Bucks

RECREATION

Field Services
TODAY

Charles E. Reed

THE RAPID increase in the nation’s population and its mo-

- bility have greatly accelerated the demands for service
from the National Recreation Association’s Field Depart-
ment. What has come about is a great increase in the num-
ber of communities and local agencies wanting help with
the new and complex public recreation and park problems
this situation has presented to them.

More Communities Served. Cities in which the NRA
helped to establish tax-supported recreation programs in
past years continue to want help from held service in efforts
to expand their own services to meet growing demands.
Simultaneously, many more small communities than here-
tofore are seeking assistance in organizing new programs
on a year-round basis with full-time directors. The NRA
held representatives could not possibly visit all of these
places, so they have been bringing together key leaders from
one limited area after another and, from a central point,
giving these localities the information and counsel they de-
sire to enable them to organize and secure the funds and
leaders to provide necessary local programs. Consequently
such area conferences of one- and two-day duration in the
districts over the country have extended the Association’s
services to many more localities.

In 1955, a total of 3,837 communities were registered with
NRA for field service—an increase from 2,312 the previous
year. One important result was that 107 communities or-
ganized and established new permanent departments of tax-
supported recreation service on a year-round basis.

New and More Complex Problems Presented. Communi-
ties, medium size as well as larger cities, are confronted
increasingly with growing problems of the unincorporated
so-called “fringe” areas outside of corporate boundaries.
The normal urban centers lack the funds, facilities, and lead-
ership to provide for the mounting demand for recreation
services from these new sections. For the hrst time, many
situations involve planning for such new services on a
county-wide or district basis. New patterns of organization,
administration, hnancing, program planning are called for.

Throughout all of the Association’s held districts, leaders
in these areas are bringing their problems to the field work-
ers for help. To meet these critical and difficult problems
demands the very best knowledge and experience the Asso-
ciation can muster from its hfty years of work nationally.
In a number of the more difficult of these situations, the
Association has been asked to make intensive studies and
prepare long-range plans to guide the combined city and
county governing authorities. During the year, fifteen such

sprawling areas established for the first time: (1) five
new county-wide recreation districts, (2) hve organized
programs on a township basis, and (3) hve additional areas
organized new park, recreation and parkway districts—all

designed to provide a wider base of service and financing
to meet the over-all need.

More Basic and Long-Range Planning Assistance Re-
quested. These important changes in community patterns
over the country have greatly accelerated the demand for
additional land for playgrounds, parks, neighborhood play-
helds, and other types of recreation facilities. Never in the
Association’s history have so many communities requested
help in specihc long-range plans and recommendations.

During 1955 the Association was consulted in connection
with ninety-four different surveys, area plans, and confer-
ences by hfty-six cities in twenty-one states.

Increased Need for More and Better Qualified Leaders.
The greater expansion of community interest and the ex-
tension of facilities inevitably have brought more demand
for the Association to help with recruiting, training and
placement of additional recreation leaders. The training
Specialists of the Association’s held staff were called in by
communities in practically all geographic district‘s last year.
As a result, a total of 10,235 paid and volunteer workers
were given training. The filling of 810 important recreation

positions involved services by the Association’s Recreation
Personnel Services at our national office.

Increased Financing Problems in Localities. All these
demands for extended service throughout the country have
brought correspondingly important problems of local
hnancing of such expanded service. The number of local
campaigns for bond issues and special recreation levies
meant more demands from communities for assistance in
organizing such campaigns and with problems of hnancing
facilities and for meeting Operating costs.

Assistance Given State Recreation Agencies. Each year
brings more interest and desire among key state agencies
—departments of parks, recreation, conservation and edu-
cation—to make their services available to localities. Fre-
quently two or more such state agencies offer similar serv-
ices. NRA has considered it important and urgent to give
consulting assistance to these groups on the best way in
which to make their services effective and to avoid duplica-
tion. The most valuable help given has been to bring those
agencies together for fuller acquaintance and understand-
ing of each other’s efforts and resources. In many instances,
NRA held workers have been directly responsible for setting
up state inter-agency committees on recreation as clearing
houses for consideration of the various problems involved.
Periodically, meetings of these committees have resulted in
more deliberate planning and channeling of state agency
services to local communities.

Difficult problems of establishing new and/or separate
state departments or agencies specihcally to handle state rec-
reation services have also arisen. In many cases new legis-
lation is required and the various state agencies and other
leaders have wanted the Association’s experience and advice
regarding these important proposals. I

JUNE is the month when America goes
out of doors for its summer recrea-
tion, and this year it will be literally
“bustin’ out all over” with every kind
of recreation activity within the broad
range of leisure living—sports and ath-
letics, music, drama, arts and crafts,
camping, boating, and so on. Why?
Because June has been proclaimed Na-
tional Recreation Month by the Nation-
al Recreation Association at the request
of recreation leaders. Many have felt
the need for a special day, week, or
month to focus public attention upon
recreation and its importance for satis-
fying living.

National Recreation Month, there-
fore, is being used as an occasion to in-
form the public about the growing
hours’of leisure provided by dramatic
new changes in modern industrial pro-
duction. It will point up the need for
community planning to provide a
framework of choice for enjoyment of
this non-working time.

During this special month local citi-
zens from all walks of life in communi-
ties across the country, will receive
special honors for their contributions to
the recreation life of their community.
A distinctive Fiftieth Anniversary cita-
tion from the Board of Directors of the
National Recreation Association is be-
ing awarded to those who have given
outstanding leadership in establishing
or extending community recreation
programs, who have been rcsponsible
for the setting aside of lands for recre-
ation use, or who in other ways have
helped the community rccrcation move-
ment in their community.

Not only individuals. but local civic
and service clubs are eligible for these.

A preview of the June presentations
occurred when Mrs. Freda Ameringer
of Oklahoma City, a local sponsor of

Mrs. Ameringer was in New York
to be honored as “Club Woman of the

a recreation center in the city’s poverty-

War II the club provided recreation
services for the area in their own club-
rooms. After the war the group under-
took a campaign for a municipally own-

recreation center.

Mrs. Ameringer persuaded the city
council to include funds for the project
in a bond issue. One of the conditions

inger headed the finance committee
which raised the money as well as an
additional $5,000.

Of Mrs. Ameringer, Stanley Draper,
manager of the Oklahoma City Cham-
ber of Commerce, said: “She well de-
serves every honor that comes to her
because she is a truly unique person—
a woman who wants only the best for
other people.”

Joseph Prendergast, executive di-
rector of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation, added: “The Association is
proud of your service to Oklahoma City
and to the national recreation move-
ment.”

National Recreation Month is the
first nation—wide observance of the im-
portant part recreation plays in the lives
of everyone” Since recreation is truly
a movement of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people, it is especially
fitting that local civic leaders be hon-
ored at this time. In the pursuit of hap-
piness, community action for recreation
has come to have a high priority on the
list of the civic improvements. I

RECREATION

ARE WE, as recreation leaders, expos-
ing our community people to a rec-
reation cafeteria? Are we as smart in
displaying our smorgasbord of activi-
ties as the purveyors of comestibles?
These are questions I’ve asked myself
many times.

The chefs who arrange the appetite
teasers at buffet luncheons, smorgas-
bords, and cafeterias display a rare
knowledge of psychology which really
sells the gastronomic delights. Do you
ever find the meats and vegetables first
in line? Of course not! You do find
pies with meringue an inch thick, cakes
with frostings in contrasting colors,
salads with a pretty girl behind them
saying, “One or two spoons of mayon-
naise?” She never says, “You don’t
want any of this stuff, do you?” (As I
write this, the television commercial
from the next room is suggesting a
bubble-and-flzz concoction for those
who have overeaten and have an upset
stomach.)

Let’s continue pushing our trays
down the line. Here are the sizzles that
sell the steaks, according to Elmer
Wheeler, the roast beef, fish, stew, fried
chicken, deviled crab, and then the
vegetables, breads and drinks. You take
two vegetables in addition to your rice
and gravy so the counter girl won’t
think you a dietetic moron.

Actually, most of us have a substan-
tial knowledge about proteins, fats, car-
* bohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and
calories; but we throw it to the wind
as we load our trays for the masticating
marathon. People are not as well
equipped for the selection of recreation

How People

Choose
Their

Recreation

Are we a help? Do people
choose their activities from
our display of goods?

Nathan Mallison

activities and hobbies to round out their
lives as they are to choose a balanced
meal; because the choice of suitable
recreation is not as exact a science as
nutrition. It isn’t strange that people
on a vacation overindulge in recreation
when suddenly confronted with a host
of appealing opportunities to engage in
many activities, considering that people
who know better go on food binges.
The big tragedy is that some do no
choosing recreationally. They are like
the man with a stomach ulcer at a
banquet.

Examining the parallel between the
provision pantry and the recreation re-
fectory further, we find that man has
certain appetites or interests which
impel him to engage in certain activi-
ties, if the opportunity is available.
Leibert H. Weir called them the.great
leisure-time interests. Other recreation
philosophers have also identified these
interests as physical, creative, dramatic,
rhythmic, linguistic, environmental, so-
cial, civic, religious, nuturing, and
vicarious. Shakespeare made a remark
in Julius Caesar, which, taken out of
context, might apply, “There is a tide
in the affairs of men, which, taken at
the flood, leads on to fortune; omitted,

all the voyage of their life is bound in
shallows and in miseries.”

Those who find the opportunities for
expression favorable, when interests
manifest themselves, will develop skills
that provide pleasure and a sense of
achievement. The activities providing
the most satisfaction may become life-
time hobbies. The person who has a
balance of continuing interests, involv-
ing physical, creative and culture ac-
tivities, will find his life enriched
through the years with better health,
stimulating mental experiences, and a
youthful spirit.

It is gratifying to note that the vol-
untary selection of leisure pastimes,
without scientific guidance, has pro-
duced so much happiness. Since it is
our job to provide recreation for all,
we must educate people to know recre-
ation values as well as they know cal-
ories, vitamin requirements, mineral
content of foods and the differences be-
tween proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
Our challenge is to eliminate recreation
illiteracy, lest some become pathologi-
cal cases whose lives fit the last half of
Shakespeare’s quotation, “Omitted, all
the voyage of their life is bound in shal-
lows and in miseries.”

What steps are indicated to answer
the dual challenge of those who need
only the opportunity to find their recre-
ation niche in the world and those who
fail to develop interests which result in
appealing leisure pastimes?

First, let’s copy the cafeteria and try
to keep up an attractive display of our
products, so temptingly exhibited that
all may have their recreation appetites
whetted. These are our silent salesmen!
Since “a good example is better than
a sermon,” we might examine a few

275

that have been effective.

The fact that these examples have a
Florida flavor is due to their proximity.
St. Peterburg, whose recreation de-
partment plays host to a fine group of
senior citizens from many states, does
a splendid display job in several divi-
sions of its work. A former U. S. Inari-
time academy, rechristened “Sunshine
University,” has at least ten kinds of
craftwork in progress most of the day
and night, each in a separate shop or
room to welcome those with a creative
urge. Three hundred sllufileboard
courts beckon others to enjoyment at
beautiful Mirror Lake Center, because
the people on them are happily engaged.

In Jacksonville, Joseph Lee Day is a
good front-window galaxy of activities
for youngsters. Another is the “Parade
of Hobbies and Activities” on televi-
sion, which is usually seen by several
hundred thousand more than would see
a static display. Lilliputian floats, por-
traying various recreation activities,
are placed in each civic parade for
25,000 to see and remember. The
model airplane club puts on the half-
time show at the big Pro Charity Foot-

ball Came and 40,000 see model flying
instead of the 4,000 which would nor-

mally see a model meet. If the game
is televised, many more see the Flying
Rebels in a miniature dogfight. Hun—
dreds of other examples, featuring a
great variety of displays that sell rec-
reation, might be described. Let’s have
a session at the Philadelphia Congress
with the topic, “What’s in Your Cafe-
teria of Activities?”

Closely allied to the cafeteria idea
of displaying a varied and appealing
assortment of wares is the necessity of
interpreting the recreation concept for
the use of leisure. This might be con-
sidered the education part of our pro-
gram. T he visual part of our display
tells what we do, the audio part tells
why and how we do it. An articulate
supervisory staff, from the superin-

 

tendent on down, utilizing every oppor-
tunity to appear before school assem-

blies and civic groups, and on radio or
television, is a strong anchor at the end
of the education chain.

Clinics help spectators as well as par-
ticipants to understand activities. Many
cities, at the start of each football sea-
son, hold a free pigskin clinic in the
stadium. A player is dressed on the
field and the cost of his equipment ex-
plained. Basic plays and formations are
shown and explained. Officials show
violations and penalties with the hand
signals for each. All the local bands
show some of their choice half-time
maneuvers. Even the ladies learn that
two halfbacks don’t make a fullback.

Forums on television and before live
audiences can bring out many interest-
ing points about recreation. The medi-
cal profession, which frowns on adver-
tising, has done a splendid job of in-
forming the public with forums and
presenting some of its accomplished
members for recognition. Can we do
less?

A panel of teen-agers can provide an
interesting evening for a recreation ex-
pert—and the audience—in a question-
and-answer session. A variation of this
might be worked out in the style of
“What’s My Line?”—which might be
changed to “What’s My Hobby?” with
a prize for the most graphic description
or demonstration.

Reports, pamphlets, and demonstra-
tions should be included in the educa-
tion part of one’s job. Demonstrations
would be appropriate during National
Recreation Week or Month.

Let’s consider another step in the
process of education for leisure. Most
recreation workers are Jacks-of-all-
trades to such an extent that they can
supply the answers to casual inquiries
about recreation. In that respect, they
are capable of giving guidance or serv-
ing as counselors to those who are vol-
untarily seeking information early in

life. However, this is an age of special-
ization. Facetiously, a doctor friend
of mine said he was an eye specialist—
left eye, under lid. I am not suggesting
that we specialize quite that far, but we
surely need skilled counselors to advise
the recreation illiterates who missed the
boat somewhere along the line and
never developed a hobby before retire-
ment. This is more important than
ever, in an age when the life span is in-
creasing, if people are to stay mentally
healthy as long as they remain physi-
cally active following their years of
productive labor.

We have established techniques to
ascertain vocational aptitudes. Isn’t it
reasonable that we should be able to
counsel people in choosing the right
recreation as a complement to fruitful
work in rounding out a happy life?

Dr. Howard Danford, director of
physical education at Florida State Uni-
versity, says there is definite evidence
that certain recreations are natural
complements to certain vocations. Ade-
quate research may reveal the total pat-
tern. I’m not suggesting a series of
tests or anything quite that dreary or
formal because recreation is the result
of a voluntary act but, rather, a folksy
discussion between the inquirer and a
counselor with worlds of experience, a
broad appreciation of activities, and a
sincere desire to assist peOple in their
pursuit of happiness.

By assisting people in this pursuit, we
are helping our countrymen to enjoy
certain inalienable rights, ascribed to
us by our Founding Fathers. They went
on further, in the Constitution and said
we were united “to promote the gen-
eral welfare.” They wrote this as an
eternal reminder that one of the pri-
mary purposes in founding our country
was to achieve individual well-being. In
helping people to choose the right rec-
reation, we are helping to fulfill the

American dream-—a good life for
everyone. I

THE INTERNATIONAL Recreation Congress will focus the
thoughts of the world’s recreation leaders on problems of
leisure and recreation around the globe.

Recreation is one of the basic human needs of people
everywhere because of the contribution which it can and
does make to education, character development, happiness,
health, safety, citizenship, international understanding. As
our world civilization becomes increasingly complex and as
hours of leisure expand everywhere, responsible thinking
men and women are challenged by the need to provide op-
portunities for creative use of leisure time, recreation which
will truly recreate men, women, and children in body and in
spirit. a

The Congress will consider such fundamental matters as
qualified leadership for recreation; setting aside ample land
for parks, playgrounds, recreation buildings; building
broad, well-balanced programs of satisfying recreation ac-
tivities to meet the needs and interests of everyone; pro-
viding competent, efficient, thoughtful administration of rec-
reation and leisure-lime programs.

On the opposite page is shown an outline of the program
for the Congress week and a list of the topics for discussion
in the many section meetings which are scheduled. The pro-
gram includes subjects of interest to American recreation
leaders as well as to leaders from other parts of the world.

Additions to the International Advisory Committee for
the International Recreation Congress in Philadelphia in-
clude the following:

MEXICO—Gabriel Ramirez, Program Director, The Voice of
Latin America

PAKISTAN—Dr. G. M. Mekhri, National Recreation Associ-
ation of Pakistan

The International Advisory Committee is still in the pro-
cess of formation and it is expected that additional members
will agree to serve.

mercial products designed to help the recreation worker will
be the most extensive of any shown at the Congress in recent
years. It offers opportunity for companies to introduce their
wares internationally as well as nationally. Two large ex-
hibit areas have beenfset aside at the Bellevue-Stratford, the
headquarters hotel. In addition, Reyburn Plaza in the heart
of downtown Philadelphia, just a few blocks from the Belle-
vue-Stratford, will offer a display of a wide variety of out-
door recreation apparatus and power equipment. All exhibit
areas will be open throughout the Congress.

There also will be educational exhibits from a great many
countries and from a number of cooperating organizations,
agencies, and departments in the United States.

Arrangements have been made this year for a Hospitality
Center in the new main lobby of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel
where delegates, especially those from foreign countries, can
immediately get answers to their questions about Philadel-
phia and the Congress. The city of Philadelphia is planning
a special exhibit in the education exhibit area. _

One of the high points of the week will be the International
Banquet on Thursday evening. This promises to be one of
the most colorful and enjoyable sessions of the Congress.

Hotel Reservations

Delegates should make their reservations immediately for
hotel accommodations. In addition to the Bellevue-Stratford
Hotel, cooperating hotels include: Adelphia, Benjamin

perintendent Of parks in Minneapolis,
Minnesota: “The question does not pose
the most important aspects Of recrea-
tion acreage. We ought to know whether
recreation acreage is increasing in prO-
portion tO the needs of recreation as
those needs are being developed in this
postwar period. Not only is the popula-
tion increasing rapidly, but the hours
of leisure are increasing; the span Of
life is increasing, therefore including
more individuals in our recreation prO-
grams; the economic status Of the popu-
lation is improving with consequently
more money tO spend on recreation as
well as other things; and there is a de-
mand for an increased standard Of pub-
lic recreation commensurate with in-
creased standards Of living in other

facets Of our life.

“Viewed from thispoint, it seems to
me that most Of us are nowhere near
keeping pace. In fact, almost all Of us
are still striving tO attain a standard
Of both quality and quantity Of recrea-
tion facilities which were advocated as
necessary years ago. In other words,

 

very few, if any Of us, have the facilities
which, for instance, the National Recre-
ation Association advocated we should
have probably twenty or twenty-five
years ago. If we haven’t reached that
standard yet, by the next twenty-five
years we are apt tO be SO woefully be-
hind that we are almost out of the pic-
ture. Our sights are entirely too low.”

It is now thirty years since that study
Of Open space needs was made by the
National Recreation Association. It
brought the conclusion that there Should
be ten acres Of recreation and park
space for each one thousand people in
the community.

We need to step up our pace if we
hope tO keep in step with the leisure
time demands Of tomorrow’s recreation
traffic. Particularly acute is the mount-
ing need for recreation space. National
Recreation Month affords an excellent
occasion, in the meantime, tO lift our
sights and to stress more Sharply long
range planning in the acquisition Of
land for public recreation.—C. E. REED,
Director, NRA Field Department. I

In 1931, Joseph Lee stated in an editorial, “Leisure for everybody, a
condition which we are now approaching, is a new thing under the sun——

the most revolutionary thing that ever happened.

Here is our

chance. . . . W e may choose the path of life or pass it by.”

Announcing New Service

A Recreation Book Center is an-
nounced by the National Recreation As-
sociation, to be initiated as a new serv-
ice on September first, at national head-
quarters, 8 West Eighth Street, New
York 11, New York. This will display
over seven hundred recreation books
that can be ordered through the NRA,
and a discount of ten per cent will be
allowed all members of the Association.
A catalog of these publications will be
distributed to all RECREATION Magazine
subscribers as a supplement to the
September issue.

This project has been made possible
through the cooperation of over eighty

Bulldozer Fight \Vins Stay

Our continued story regarding the
battle in Central Park, New York,’ be-
tween local mothers and Park Commis-
sioner Robert Moses has reached an
impasse—with the former obtaining a
stay of trial. A four-day cease-lire in-
junction stopped, temporarily, all work
on preparation of the site for a res-
taurant parking area.

So far, the “temporary” injunction
still holds, upon a motion by city at-

the case. This may go on until next

Recreation Is Where You Find It

0 A copy of George Butler’s book, An
Introduction to Community Recrea-
tion, was located by Priscilla Urner at
the University of Ryukyu’s library in
Okinawa. Mrs. Urner, who had been
looking for a copy of the book in con-
nection with her duties as a military
recreation director on the island, re-

, ports that Mr. Butler’s work was the

only English title in a long stack of
Japanese volumes.

0 Edna V. Braucher of the National
Recreation Association, who has just
returned from a trip around the world,
brought back this version of the home
of “the old woman who lived in a
shoe.” It has been constructed as a

playhouse for the children, in Kamala

 

Nehru Park, Bombay, India.

0 “We are arranging to incorporate

sites for many recreation centers in our
town plan to serve all communities and

are also reserving large areas as parks
and open spaces,” writes Fakhri Al

Fakhri, Lord Mayor of Amant Al Asina,
Baghdad, to Thomas E. Rivers, execu-
tive secretary of the NRA International

Service. “Your visit to Baghdad was of
great value to us,” he continues, “and
I am grateful to you for much useful

information. . . .”

Children and TV

Here is one problem that parents,
teachers and leaders did not have to
worry about in 1906! In 1956, how-
ever, it is of interest and encouraging
to read, in the May issue of California
Parent-Teacher, an announcement that
NBC network has appointed Dr. Fran-
ces Horwich (Miss Frances of “Ding-
Dong School”) as supervisor of chil-
dren’s programs and chairman of the
Children’s Review Committee. Also
serving on this committee are Mrs.
Douglas Horton, former president of
Wellesley College, and Dr. Robert Col-
denson, psychologist and expert on
family relations.

A study was made by the committee
of all National Broadcasting’s chil-
dren’s programs and the report will be
used as a basis for future planning. The
report commended the network for its
“effort to maintain a common standard
of excellence wherever children are in—
volved,” but also pointed out certain
weaknesses in present programs de-
signed for children and family viewing.
A few among these were: Effect on
parent-child relationships; over-excite-
ment of a solid hour or more; bad
grammar, poor pronunciation, name
calling; slapstick—~0ver-done, destruc-
tive, too frequent and in questionable
taste; crudeness; camera shots tending
to frighten the children; over-empha-
sis on money; exploitation of children;
misguided enlightenment or insufficient
enlightenment; group relations (in re-
lation to race, religious, and nation-
ality groups); stereotypes in plot and
character.

The study calls for general correc-
tion, and the committee has submitted
a list of recommendations, some of
which already are being initiated.

News Items in 1907

M ay—N ational sanction has been given
to the playground movement by a re-
cent action of congress in apprOpriat-
ing $75,000 for the beginning of a per-
manent playground system for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. The city already has

° over 1,300 small parks. This appropria-

tion is for the requisition of sites in ac-
cordance with the Playground Plan for
Washington. The drawing and adopting
of this plan were the first official acts
of the

America.

Playground Association of

May—In a city near Philadelphia, a
keeper of a playground for the summer
is wanted at once—$10 a week.

June 20, 21, 22——The first annual
meeting of the Playground Association
of America will be held in Chicago, Il-
linois. Among outstanding addresses
will be that of Dr. Luther Gulick, presi-
dent of the Association, on “Play and
Democracy,” and Miss Jane Addams,
of Hull House, on “Public Recreation
and. Social Morality,” and “Play as a
Training in Citizenship,” by Joseph
Lee, vice-president, Massachusetts Civic
League. The evening session on Friday
willobe a presentation of the pros and
cons of the question, “Should Munici-
pal Playgrounds be Controlled by the
Board of Education,” with Dwight H.
Perkins, architect of the Chicago Board
of Education and member of the Spe-

Professor Charles Zueblin, University
of Chicago, Commissioner Henry B. F.
Macfarland, president of Board of Com-
missioners of the District of Columbia,
and Dr. Henry Curtis of the Associa-
tion, presenting the negative. Joseph
Lee will chair the meeting.

July 10.——— The Seashore Tent for the

members of the Kindergarten Mother’s
Clubs and their children opened at
Coney Island (New York). The camp
will be open every day, with the excep-
tion of Sunday, to enable hundreds of
Brooklyn children to enjoy the simple
pleasures of sand and sea without the
over-stimulating and unwholesome con-
ditions of the crowded popular resorts.

September—The opening of a new play-
ground in Brooklyn (New York) this

summer was marked by the presenta-
tion of a beautiful Hag by the McPher-
son-Doane Grand Army Post. No fur-
ther announcement to the neighborhood
was required, and for blocks parents as
well as children responded. The spirit
of patriotism can be fostered and
should pervade a playground.

ry-over value of this activity makes it
extremely p0pular. All students are
taught in twelve Penguin-class sailboats
owned by the department. Instruction
is done by the recreation director with
volunteer help from the department’s
teen-age sailing club—the “Boom Dod-
gers,” and members of the Lake Merritt
Sailing Club. A three-dollar fee is re-
quired, to partially cover minor main-
tenance costs. During 1955 over one
hundred and sixty-five students, both
young people and adults, were trained
in the fundamentals of sailing. The
course includes: Instruction Ashore:
Introductory discussion on the thrill
and satisfaction of knowing how to sail
a boat; nomenclature; rigging and un-

Virginia Musselman

WHAT was IT LIKE, back in 1906? What had happened
not too long before? This is not irrelevent to the
question of recreation programs then and now, because
events have a most direct bearing on the needs and inter-
ests of people. In the seeds of the past are the fruits of the
future.

Pretend you were living in 1906. Only forty years be-
fore, the first Atlantic cable had been laid successfully.
Thirty years before Bell had invented the telephone. That
sameoyear saw the first carbon arc light—but it would be
1910 before the electric light bulb that we know was in-
vented.

Only twelve years before, Mr. Edison’s first kinetoscope
showing took place in New York—the forerunner of the
moving picture. Six years before, Carrie Nation began her
personal war against the saloons and “blind tigers,” wield-
ing her hatchet so effectively that eventually the entire
nation went dry.

Five years before, McKinley was assassinated, and Theo-
dore Roosevelt, the vice-president, took over the duties of
office. In that year, Marconi succeeded in signaling the
letter 5 across the Atlantic, and the next year succeeded in
sending the first radio message.

The year 1903 was spectacular: Orville Wright made the
first successful flight in a plane; the Ford Motor Company
was officially organized, and the first automobile trip across
the United States from San Francisco to New York was
made. (It took from May 13 to August 1!)

In 1906, the birthdate of the Playground Association,
San Francisco was destroyed by fire. In 1907, came a ter-
rible financial panic (remember 1929?); in 1909, l’eary
reached the North Pole, and Louis Blériot made the first
flight by plane across the English Channel.

In 1911, Amundsen reached the South Pole, and the first
transcontinental flight across the United States was made.
fit was eighty-two hours and four minutes in the air, and

made frequent landings.)
In 1914, the First World War was the most important

event, of course; but in that year the first ship passed
through the Panama Canal.

What has this to do with program? Read between the
lines! The world was becoming smaller as far as time and
transportation were concerned. Communication through
telephone, telegraph, movies, and radio had begun. Oceans
had been joined. The sky had been opened. Horses were
beginning to get used to seeing automobiles. And this
growth meant business, industries, factories, labor, slums,
exploitation, poverty, vice and crime.

Across the land began to blow a great wind of social
consciousness. Certain men and women looked around them,
and were appalled at what they saw. They looked abroad
and saw experiments going on in education and child care.
They started settlement houses, health centers—and play-
grounds. They worked for legislation against child labor,
legislation for parks and playgrounds, welfare services,
medical care. Their names, many of them mentioned in this
issue, still ring out.

Truly, “there were giants in the land.” These people left
footsteps that few of us could fill today. They were the pio-
neers in our field. They broke the paths that we now travel.
They prodded the conscience of a nation. They set the
foundations for the principles in education, recreation, and
social work on which today’s social structures stand. With
almost everything against them, with almost nothing but
faith, h0pe, love, and a fiery sense of justice, they revolu-
tionized the life of a nation. We are forever in their debt.

When the Playground Association was a year old, it pub-
lished its first magazine, THE PLAYGROUND, five-and-a-half
by eight-and-a-half-inches in size, sixteen pages long, ten
cents a copy! Those departments, libraries, and individ-
uals lucky enough to have the complete set of this magazine
should treasure it. Those in the recreation movement today
should read these early issues, because in their pages are
reflected the beginnings of public recreation.

RECREATION

In them is the story of the playground built and operated
by Hull House in Chicago, in 1893. It had swings, seesaws,
giant strides and sandbins. “Play was totally disorganized
both on the part of children and of the supervisors, and
everything from games to management had to be learned.”

In 1896, University Settlement, operated by Northwest-
ern University, opened its playground. From three to four
thousand children used it. It was a large area and had
many benches as well as several “retiring rooms.” A police
officer and a matron were in charge.

The story of Chicago is thrilling—public funds in four
years amounting to ten million dollars for “park play-
grounds,” surrounded by high iron fences (hidden by
shrubs), and including separate play areas for small chil-
dren, outdoor swimming pool open two days for men, two
days for women, and until 9:30 at night, lighted. The ath-
letic fields had baseball diamonds, football fields, and tennis
courts, and were sprayed in the winter for ice skating. The
fieldhouse contained a restaurant, library, gym, a plunge
pool, and clubrooms.

 

This was the day of the middy blouse and long skirt.

It is perhaps significant that the very first game described
in this magazine did not appear until the September 1907
issue—and was a Japanese game, Kotari. It is also signifi-
cant that almost all of those early issues had news items
about playgrounds, playschools, and other recreation pro—
grams in Paris, London, and in various countries. Interna-
tional recreation got an early start!

Read the November 1907 issue for a delightful essay on
“Prisoners’ Base” by Joseph Lee. This issue also announc-
ed the publication of Education By Plays and Games by
George Ellsworth Johnson, with an introduction by Dr. G.

Stanley Hall.

It is in the December 1907 issue, however, that we get
the first detailed report of a day’s recreation program. It
is the program of the Pittsburgh Playground Association,
and is probably quite typical of the activities and leader-
ship techniques used in those beginning days:

The playground opened at 9 A.M. Youngsters assembled
in the school yard, and took part in “opening exercises” by
forming into line, singing patriotic songs and saluting the
flag. Those from eight to fourteen years old then marched

into the building to “classes.” The younger children stayed
outdoors, marched, sang, played in the sandboxes and with
their pull-toys, molded in clay, cut paper, made rag and
paper dolls, folded, pasted, knit and braided. They also
listened to stories and to songs.

Inside, the eight-to-fourteen’s could choose between many
classes—cooking, basketry, woodwork, drawing, color work,
design, stenciling, mechanical drawing, nature study, nurs-
ing, household training, and physical training. The latter
was formal—drills with wands and clubs, marching, danc-
ing, and games.

Every Friday was “Flower Day.” Women on a flower
committee prepared small bouquets which were distributed
to the children at the diHerent parks, playgrounds, and
schools. (Today we hear more about ice cream, lemonade,
lollipops, or watermelons. The flower idea is a nice one! )

You think playground work must have been easier in “the
good old days”? Take a look at the Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts Vacation Schools. The older pupils twelve to thir-
teen could choose between sloyd (know what that is?)*
and drawing, or basketry, cooking or sewing. The younger
ones received instruction in drawing, watercolor, reading,
and writing.

The playground had a shelter with baths (baths were im-

portant then—many homes didn’t have theml), sandboxes,
and provided baseball in the summer, skating in the winter.

At first boys weren’t allowed, but they hung around and
were so fascinated that they were finally allowed in. There
was no apparatus. The youngsters played beanbag, quoits,
and circle games. They learned sewing, knitting, crochet-
ing, picking and working sewing cards. (The boys worked
on the sewing cards and knit reins!) Other activities in-
cluded singing, speaking pieces, marching, and dressing up.

Comment at the time: “Another gain has been that, now
the novelty has worn off, the crowds of rough boys who
used to gather at the outskirts of the schoolyard have greatly
diminished and fewer appeals have to be made to the police.”

in March 1908, there is an article about two new games
devised by E. B. DeCroot, director of the South Park Play-
grounds and Gymnasiums in Chicago. Playground Ball
was for outdoors; Long Ball for indoors. They clicked!
They swept the city. The churches, the golf clubs, the tennis
clubs, the industrial workers at noontime all played these
games—so many people and teams that an association had

to be formed.

The April 1910 issue jumped to thirty pages, and de-
scribed lndependence Day programs in Springfield, Massa-
chusetts, St. Paul, Minnesota and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
In it, too, was an article on “Play Centers in France,” and an
announcement of Games for the Playground, Home, School
and Gymnasium, by Jessie Bancroft, Assistant Director of
Physical Training in New York City. It was priced at $1.50.
(A revised edition of this book is now priced at $8.50”
Many people who do or have done active recreation leader-
ship think that for organization and easy use no other game
book has surpassed Miss Bancroft’s.

The May 1910 issue of THE PLAYGROUND jumped to sev-
enty-two pages. It has three articles'worthy of note: for
the first time an article specifically on playgrounds and
juvenile delinquency, the first on exams for playleaders, and
the first on recreation for the handicapped—4n this case the
following letter from Helen Keller:

“Our best institutions for the blind have good play-
grounds. As for the blind child who lives at home, he should
be encouraged to play with the seeing. If they will meet
him halfway in their sports, he will gain far more than if he
plays with other blind children, who are slower and more
timid in their games. Besides, a blind playmate will ac-
custom his seeing friends to take the capabilities of the
sightless for granted, and then the companionship of the
blind and the seeing will benefit both.”

Also, the outline of the National Congress to be held in
Rochester, New York, shows that recreation had come a
long way in four years.

If we substitute television for moving pictures, and in-

dustrial recreation for factory work, that program would

288

fit nicely into the core of any current conference or congress.

Incidentally, we today perhaps haven’t given much
thought to the terrific impact movies made upon the recre-
ation life of America, particularly in cities. It was esti-
mated, for example, that ninety-five per cent of the New
York working girls (from fourteen years up) spent their
Saturday nights in dance halls, of which there were literally
hundreds. These were unsavory places, less regulated then
than now, where the girl danced five minutes and “sat” for
fifteen—and drinking was required while sitting! Movies
practically replaced the dance halls, and the penny arcades.

Clothing is often a clue to recreation activities. On a
playground in 1906, the young lady in charge was very
elegant in high-necked, full-sleeved shirtwaist, and very
full, long skirt, cotton stockings, and high shoes. Her hair
was long, piled on top of her head, but hidden by a large,
wide-brimmed hat. The young man in charge looked very
elegant, also, in his tight collar, fitted jacket and trousers.
The little girls dressed like the lady leader, with black or
white long cotton stockings, hair hanging around their
shoulders. The little boys wore big caps, suspenders, and
fairly tight pants that ended just above or just below the
knees, plus long, ribbed cotton stockings.

What did the children do, back in the beginning of the
century? The boys couldn’t join the Boy Scouts, because
it wasn’t organized until 1910. The girls couldn’t join the
Girl Scouts or Camp Fire Girls—they came later, in 1912.

Playgrounds were for children—the very young up to
around twelve years old. Primarily, they were for the un-
derprivileged.

Playground activities were much the same—circle, sing-
ing and running games, handcrafts, singing, simple dra-
matics, storytelling, folk dancing, baseball, football, tennis,
ice skating and tobogganing in the winter. Sports programs

were not so highly organized or competitive. Softball and
table tennis weren’t invented yet.

The atmosphere was different, however. Programs had
more drills, marches, and formalized physical education.
Folk dancing was much stronger then than now, as were
pageants and festivals on a large scale. Nowhere do we
hear of cooperative planning of leaders and youngsters.
The playground “climate” was not permissive.

Co-recreation for teen-agers was limited to folk dancing,
and to special parties or simple, occasional dances, heavily
chaperoned. A teen center, as we know it, would have been
unthinkable. No one had dreamed yet of a golden-age cen-
ter, or of hospital recreation, plant-centered programs, and
day camps. (Yet back in 1907 the Playground Association
advocated hundreds of camps to be located outside the city

limits, for boys and girls whose only playgrounds were the
city streets!)

So—go back and read the early issues of THE PLAY-
GROUND. There it all is—the seeds of a revolution in public
attitude, fertilized with endless labor, zeal, belief, and
prayer, kept alive through panics and depressions by faith,
cultivated with imagination and self-sacrifice. They bore

strong, healthy plants, the fruits of which cover our land
today. May we in recreation today plant as well! I

Nellie J. Sullivan

Are you looking for ideas to interest and entertain teen-
agers? Is that age group the big thorn in your recreational
side? Are you willing to devote weeks of work, bottles of
bicarbonate, the diplomacy of a Dulles, and the patience of
a pachyderm to an evening of fun exclusively for that be-
wildering age group? Why not have a ball? We have been
doing just that for the past eight years here in Torrington,
Connecticut, and, believe me, the sight of several hundred
young’uns really “having a ball” repays immeasurably the
time and work spent in staging the affair. They respond to
the occasion with such enthusiasm, such cooperation, and
such courtesy that we have dedicated ourselves to the tenet
that teen-agers are pretty wonderful people. The North,
South, and East Side Community Associations and Hope
Grange, representing the west side of the city, assist us with
the ball every year.

Although such an affair can be staged anytime through-
out the year, we call our ball a Mardi Gras, holding it the
Saturday evening preceding the Lenten season. Four weeks
before that date the people of Torrington start voting for
teen-age kings and queens from the north, south, east, and
west sections of the city to represent them at the ball. The
voting period continues for two weeks; and any Torrington
resident can vote for one king and one queen by just writ-
ing the names of his two selections for the royalty honors,
along with the sections of the city in which they reside, on
a postcard and mailing it to the city recreation department.
The ballot must bear the personal signature and address of
the sender. Any youngster from the freshman class to nine-
teen years of age is eligible for king or queen honors. In

thousand postcard votes are received. The local paper prints
3 daily list of those receiving nominations—this list covers
from seventy-five to one hundred candidates. At the end of
the two-week voting period, we announce as kings and
queens those boys and girls receiving the highest number
of votes in each of the four sections of town. Under no
circumstances do we divulge the number of votes received
by any nominee. The two-week interval between the ballot-
ing and the ball gives the eight lucky ones time to prepare
themselves and their wardrobes for the big night.

On the night of the Mardi Gras the local armory, deco-

throne for the king and queen of each section and, in the
center, a huge throne with two golden chairs and a back-

queen of the Mardi Gras. From the ceiling is suspended a
mammoth net holding more than a thousand balloons.

From seven to eight o’clock, local folks may view the deco-
rations. Then, producing their forty-cent admission tickets,
the teen-agers come in, spruced and sparkling, and while
away the time visiting and listening to the music provided
by a local band.

Promptly at nine o’clock, with the blare of trumpets, the
royal couples, in formal attire—transported, corsaged, and
boutonniered by men from their particular community as-
sociations—march, one couple at a time, to their respective
thrones where they are crowned and presented with gold
trophies by their sectional representatives. Each king has
the first dance with his queen—and then everyone gets out
on the floor for general dancing.

Shortly after ten o’clock the Hoor is cleared and, one by
one, the eight nominees come to the center of the ball-
room and, by popular applause, the King and Queen of the
Mardi Gras are selected. These two happy youngsters are
formally crowned by the mayor and his wife. They are pre-
sented with scrolls and keys to the city of New Orleans,
items which have been previously received from the mayor
of that famous city. In addition, there are scrolls from the
governor of Connecticut. Local merchants “ante up” with
unsolicited gifts, such as a complete Easter outfit, govern-
ment bond, portable radio, and so on.

This presentation period is dispatched quickly. Their
royal highnesses are escorted to the main throne where
congratulations, picture taking, and conversation are the
program of the moment.

The remainder of the evening is devoted to dancing. At
about eleven-thirty, a half-hour before the affair ends, the
net of balloons is lowered from the ceiling. There is a mad
dash to capture the balloons, several of which have prize
tags attached. (Having the balloon shower at that late hour
is a device to keep young folks at the dance to the very end.)
Ollicials of the newspapers and radio serve as judges for the
ball, and the entire program is broadcast over WTOR, the
local broadcasting station.

“My, that all sounds lovely,” you say, “but what about
the cost?” We have found that cost is a variable depend-
ing upon two things: the enthusiasm of the recreation de-
partment for the project, and its willingness to roll up its
sleeves and go to work. Publicity via newspaper and radio
aroused our townsfolk to the point where contributions
come in, not only from the various community associations,
but also from other groups. As has been pointed out, all
prizes are unsolicited. The admission fee, small as it is,
helps to pay the bills. The fact that this time of year is an
off-season for our employees cuts labor down to a mini-
mum cost.

Perhaps the best way to count the cost is to decide what
price tag should be placed on the efforts of any adult group
——whether it be a recreation department, a PTA, or a serv-
ice club—to help our youngsters through the “trying teens”
by providing them with well-planned entertainment. We
find the cost here in Torrington is a minimal amount be-
cause, to quote our happy teen-age crowd, “We certainly

had a ball!” I

COOPERATIVE CAMPING

We hear a good deal about integration of special groups these days, but this is a

brand new type! An imaginative solution for limited facilities and budgets. A c0-
operative project for social and recreation agencies. A delightful and meaningful
experience for two diverse groups—the blind and the older adults—of mixed ages.
Results? So satisfactory that the project will be repeated, on a larger scale, this summer.

“This was the most wonderful week
of my life!”

“I wish we’d all catch the measles or
something and be quarantined so we
could stay longer.”

“I’ll be back next year if I have to
come in a wheelchair.”

These remarks are typical of those
made as golden-agers and blind camp-
ers'concluded a six-day stay at Camp
Indian Springs in Butler, Pennsylvania.
The first was spoken by a blind girl who
has missed out on much of the fun
normal teen-agers take for granted; the
second by a golden-ager, on her first
vacation away from family and respon-
sibility in years; the third by a man,
partially blind and afflicted with muscu-_
lar sclerosis.

How did these two seeminglyo incon-
gruous groups get together? Early last
year, at a meeting of our local blind as-
sociation, the subject of camping for
the blind was brought up. The big prob-
lem was, as usual, finances—and the
limited number of blind peOple inter-
ested in camp life. For some time, the
Butler Recreation Department had been
toying with the idea of a week at camp
for members of our golden-age group;
but we, too, were plagued with financial
difficulties. So, why not pool our re-
sources and work out a cooperative
camp?

The final result far surpassed our
hopes. Forty campers had the week of
their lives — twenty-four golden-agers,

ment of public recreation and MR. WAL-

sixteen blind people. We feel that nei-
ther group by itself could have been so
successful— but, ' COOperatively, it’s a
combination hard to beat. The golden-
agers helped the blind, and felt wonder-
ful because they were needed; and the
blind people, some for the first time in
their lives, were enjoying normal pur-
suits of fun. Lasting friendships were
formed between the elderly and the
blind who found that older people can
be useful and active. Most important
of all, they had fun in a mixed group of
varying ages. They talked, played, ate,
relaxed, and worshipped together and
found that, despite all handicaps, they
could enjoy it. Two groups of people
left for camp—one group returned.
To those of you who have taken
groups camping for years, these facts
may be far from remarkable. It was a
first here in Butler; but we don’t intend
it to be the last of such camping ven-
tures. This is mainly written for those
cities who have not'yet tried camping
activities for such groups, and to en-
courage more of such relaxation and
recreation. If we can do it, so can you!

Problems and Some Solutions

Camp Site. This should be compara-
tively level, with easy access to all fa-
cilities. We were able to rent a church
camp, complete with dormitories, a fine
kitchen, and a pool. Surprisingly, the
pool provided the most popular activ-
ity at camp. Some of the golden-agers
hadn’t been swimming for years; some
of the blind had never been in the water.
Only a few of the golden-agers had
brought bathing suits, but after the first
day, as enthusiasm for swimming grew,

u.‘

bathing suits were shared and any type
sports clothes that could be improvised
for such were used. A guard r0pe
warned about depth; and a small radio
on the diving board also helped in the
orientation of the blind.

Rates. Since many golden-agers and
blind persons have limited incomes, it
is most important to arrive at a rate
well within everyone’s budget. By care-
ful planning and the use of government
surplus foods, we were able to break
even by charging only $15 per person
for the six-day period. Every economic
shortcut possible was used; for exam-
ple, in our golden-age group one couple
worked on the staff—the wife was an
accredited practical nurse, the husband
acted as chief dishwasher. They enjoy-
ed a week of camp privileges, and we
were spared the necessity of hiring
extra help.

Staff. An experienced camp director is
vital to the success of the whole pro-
gram, preferably one who understands
the problems of the blind. A good camp
cock is also most important. Our meals
were all served family style, with sec-
onds if desired. In addition, staff in-
cluded: two assistant cooks, three dish-
washers, one lifeguard, one nurse. Our
camp director and her assistant were
both employees of the Butler Blind As-
sociation and so their services to the
camp were considered as part of their
regular duties. This helps explain how
our Operating costs were so low.

Program. A representative from each
dormitory helped to plan the daily pro-
gram, thus assuring activities of inter-
est to all. No one was compelled to

291

join any group; if he preferred to sit
under a tree, he (lid. The day’s pro-
gram started at 7:30 A.M. and ended
at 10:30 PM. There was swimming,
music, dancing, games, nature hikes
and studies, group discussions on such
topics as retirement and social security,
arts and crafts, inter-faith devotions.
One of the blind campers, a young
minister, was invaluable in leading
morning and evening interdenomina-

tional devotionals and in general being
an outstanding personality. A local
photographer furnished four cameras
and a dozen rolls of film, and the gold-
en-agers took turns being “official”
camp photographer. The best photo-
graph snapped on the camp grounds
was taken by a totally blind camper.
What more can be said to indicate the
success of this unique camping venture
than that it turned out to be not only

an experiment in group living, but also
a happy holiday for everyone con-
cerned?

Without splendid community coop-
eration the camp could never have been
a success. The local newspaper and
two radio stations covered the story
completely; the Butler Lion’s Club pro-
vided a bus to transport the campers;
interested citizens made donations; and
everybody pitched in to help. I

 

Nature Activities
in Camping

A plea for better leadership.
Janet Nickelsburg

I HAVE HAD the opportunity to visit and work in a great

many children’s camps, and the more I see of the sort
of programs planned for children in the field of nature study,
the more I realize the need for the enlightenment of leaders
as to the nature possibilities a camp site offers.

At one camp in the high mountains, where all the beauty
of tall trees, all the geology of mountain structure, and all
the wild life of mountain streams and virgin brush lay about,
the land was being cleared, the shrubs torn away to expose
bare ground so that a badminton court could be constructed.
The rough, raw flat of the hilltop cried aloud in its naked-
ness, and an object lesson was being created in how to
start destructive erosion.

At such a camp there are infinite possibilities for the
explorer in all fields of nature. How much better to have
cleared a pathway, and a very narrow one, for a nature
trail—where each plant as it was pushed aside would reveal
its own history, its own adaptations to its environment, and
the multitude of small creatures which use it as their habitat!

The teaching of nature study should concern itself, to my
thinking. with the larger picture, not with the analysis of its
parts. We are all too prone to think that we have taught the
children about nature when they are able to identify twenty
trees or wild flowers or rocks. When we have succeeded in
doing this, this alone is what they know. They know noth-
ing of the relationships of one thing to another, the condi-
tions which enable those things to live where they are, noth-
ing of the life cycles of living things. We take our children
into the outdoors and we teach them to destroy. They pick
wild flowers, they kill butterflies and other insects, and they
take home a more or less accurate collection to show their

parents. But, the average child has small. interest afterwards
in this collection. I

To find a flower and to watch it develop on the stem, to
see it go from bud to seed, to watch it day by day, to observe
it carefully enough so as to be able to sketch it in every
phase of its development, that is the only manner in which
children’s collections-should be made. Such living eXperi-
ences will never be allowed to perish as collections of dead
objects inevitably do.

At another camp the children brought some frogs from
the creek. We kept them for a while, but warm weather and
unsuitable conditions inevitably took their toll, and before
we had a chance to return them to their natural environ-
ment we found that one had died. We began to ask ourselves
why? What environment did a frog really need and why
had it not eaten what we gave it? We decided then, that we
would like to find out what a frog really does eat, and so,
since the frog was dead, we thought we might learn some-
thing from our poor little victim. We dissected it, and the
contents of the stomach revealed that larvae, which we had
found in such abundance adhering to rocks in the stream,
made up a large part of the diet—and perhaps that was why
our offerings of dead mosquitoes and beetles had gone un-
tasted. This, then, had become a lesson in ecology.

Our children were being taught to observe, not to capture
small animals solely for playthings. The place for a frog to
live is at the brookside, and our children should be encour-
aged to build an enclosure by that brookside to satisfy their
sense of ownership and to allow further observation.

No man should ever really believe that he owns a living
thing, for ownership too often means the power to destroy
at will. The welfare of living creatures which we have as
pets or domestic animals is—like that of our children—a
responsibility, not alone because their loss would mean
money out of pocket, but because of the inherent rights of
any animal.

To understand that the countryside was not made for his
enjoyment only, to perceive how each thing that makes up
the countryside fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, that each
is one part of a fascinating whole—that is the lesson man
must learn, not only in the country, but wherever living,
growing things can take hold and flourish.

To teach our children this sort of nature study is not only
a challenge but an obligation of all those whose field of

recreation touches on the child’s relationship to the world
that lies about him. I

The Changing Picture of

Recreation Areas and Facilities

Comparison of public recreation areas and facilities in
the first decade of this century with those now provided for
public use reveals marked changes and developments during
the past fifty years. Building materials widely used today
were scarce or not available a half-century ago. Recreation
areas now afford opportunities for a greater variety of ac-
tivities and are laid out according to less formalized, stereo-
typed patterns. Recreation planning today takes into ac-
count the interests of people of all ages; whereas, in 1906,
children received the primary consideration.

Even though striking advances have been made in the
past half-century, a tribute should be paid to the effective,
intelligent work of the early leaders and planners in the
recreation movement. Their keen observation of the inter-
ests and needs of children gave them an understanding of
the kinds of play areas that proved of the greatest value and
had the strongest appeal, and that are equally applicable
today. The playgrounds they designed fostered the basic
play activities of children—among them climbing, running,
imitative play, sand and water play. For many years, how-
ever, most playgrounds provided meager facilities except
for highly organized games and apparatus play.

City-Wide Area Plans

The concept of a city-wide system of recreation areas has
been drastically expanded during the past five decades. In
the early days planners thought primarily in terms of a
few types of unrelated areas—children’s playgrounds, ath-

Areas—Their Design and Equipment and Introduction to
Community Recreation.

letic centers, large landscape parks, boulevards, civic cen-
ters, and waterfront developments. Today city planning for
recreation provides for a system of well distributed, diversi-
fied recreation areas, each designed to serve a variety of
recreation interests and needs, many of which had little, if
any, place in earlier area plans. It is also integrated with
other aSpects of the city plan. Standards for total recrea-
tion space as well as for specific types of recreation areas
have also been widely adopted. Large properties lying~ out-
side city limiits have been acquired by many cities and
developed for recreation uses, such as golf, camping, pic-
nicking, boating, and nature study—to name only a few.

The change in ideas as to recreation areas is strikingly
illustrated by comparing with present-day standards a 1906
playground plan for Washington, D. C., drawn up by
the Playground Association of America. The Washington
plan “sought to distribute playgrounds pretty regularly
throughout the District of Columbia and to provide thirty
square feet of school playground for each child connected
with the school, an outdoor playground of not less than two
acres for each school district, and an athletic field for each
of the four sections of the city.” This plan, officially adopted
by the school district authorities, served as a pattern in
several other cities.

The tiny playground for children has long since been re-
placed by the more adequate neighborhood playground~—-a
change which Joseph Lee pr0phetically foresaw in a speech
years before the Association was founded: “We want not a
boys” playground nor a children’s playground, but a neigh-
borhood playground.” Instead of thirty square feet per
pupil, school authorities recommend a site of five acres
plus an added acre for each one hundred children enrolled
in an elementary school. The community playfield of ten

293

to twenty acres or more with facilities for people of all ages
has taken the place of the “athletic field” in the early Wash-

ington plan.

Playground Equipment

Marked changes have occurred in the types of equipment
installed on the first playgrounds. Much of this apparatus
was built of wood, whereas wood has only limited use in
today’s apparatus. In the cities, gigantic combination gym-
nasium frames were erected, with climbing ropes and teeter
ladders, flying rings, trapeze, swings and other apparatus.
Today, apparatus is simpler, lower, and installed in smaller
units. Changes in the standard types, such as swings, by
adding the rubber bumper or belting seat, have been made
primarily in the interest of safety, or, with the use of the
hobby horses, to increase their appeal. Climbing apparatus
has been modified to serve more fully the interests and

capacity of children. Separate sets of apparatus are no
longer provided for boys and for girls, as in the early
playgrounds.

Several unusual pieces of apparatus developed by the New
York City Housing Authority have been widely installed at
playgrounds under housing, school, and municipal auspices.
They include pipe tunnels, play logs, walls of cinder blocks,
platforms and pyramids built of concrete—some of them
reminiscent of inexpensive equipment used several decades
earlier. Play sculptures, including animals and free form
figures cast in concrete, have gained wide approval because
they tend to encourage imaginative forms of play.1 Other
more complicated types with flexible components that react
to the impact of the users and that constantly challenge their
skill have recently been devised and have aroused consider-
able interest. How the playground children in 1906 would
have gazed with wonder at the dismantled automobiles, fire-
trucks and airplanes or pirates’ galleon that afford delight
to the users of many playgrounds today!

Another recent development that promises to make areas

more valuable and attractive to children is the tendency to
select and arrange apparatus in a way that makes possible
related and progressive play activities.2 The current ten-
dency to paint units or portions of apparatus in contrasting
colors has resulted in greater safety and more pleasant

appearance.

Surfacing

Fine gravel, cinders, and mixed Cinders and clay were
among playground surfaces suggested in The Normal Course
in Play published in 1909 by the Association. These, along
with crushed stone or limestone screenings, were used for
surfacing many of the early areas. Dust was a serious
problem and falls resulted in bad abrasions. The ideal sur-
face for playgrounds heavily used the year-round has not
yet been developed, but several non-abrasive, resilient sur-
faces are in use, notably those in which a product like cork,

 

these in Hartford, Connecticut, proved
n of the century. The idea stillhas merit.

rubber, or asbestos has been combined with bituminous
material.

Construction of paved multiple-use areas for court games,
roller and ice skating, dancing, and general play—common
procedure today—was virtually non-existent fifty years ago.
At that time, tennis was played either on the lawn or on
clay courts, whereas most public courts now are constructed

of concrete or bituminous materials so as to minimize main-
tenance and extend the periods of play.

Many improvements have been made in recreation equip-
ment items. Basketball goals, formerly made of wood and
with supporting posts erected on the boundary of the court,
are today specially designed of steel and are supported by
arms that project from the posts, resulting in greater safety
and improved play. Concrete has replaced wood in the con-
struction of many items, such as sandbOXes, handball walls,
benches, and tables for picnicking and table tennis. Knock-
down bleachers—sturdy but easily moved from one loca-
tion to another—serve more diversified uses than the old

type of fixed seating facilities and permit more flexible use
of limited recreation spaces. All-metal nets used at tennis
courts are another example of equipment designed to reduce
maintenance costs.

Lights

Darkness put a stop to play at most public recreation areas
during the early days of the movement, but today their use-
fulness is greatly extended by the installation of lights per-
mitting evening use. The first lights installed at recreation
areas were arc lights, supported by wooden poles, with over-
head wires. Only small units such as game courts were
illuminated. Today extensive areas used for games requir-
ing a high quantity of brightness—such as baseball or
softball, as well as many, other recreation facilities—are
commonly equipped with lights of superior quality, mounted
on steel poles served by underground circuits. Installation

are being used—steel, aluminum, brick and plexiglass, to
mention only a few. Use of these materials and of pre-cast
concrete units is causing radical changes in pool construc-
tion methods.

The wading pool, as in the early days, is still a most
popular playground feature. Some cities, however, have in-
stalled a substitute—the spray pool. It is less expensive to
build and eliminates the problem of water purification,
but does not afford the same type of play experience as the
wading pool.

Winter Facilities

Widespread interest in winter sports has paralleled the
increase in popularity of swimming and other aquatic ac-
tivities. The demand for opportunities to ski has resulted
in construction of ski tows, jumps, slopes and runs designed
to serve the needs of people with varying skills. The arti-

of underwater lights at swimming pools is a significant de-
velopment in recent years that has contributed greatly to
safety and enjoyment of night swimming.

Pools

Advances made in design, construction, and operation
of swimming pools have been "‘most significant. In 1906 a
pool was essentially a concrete tank equipped with inlets
and outlets for filling and emptying it. Little or no provi-
sion was made for water purification—the pool was merely
emptied periodically—or for the convenience of bathers.
The modern well-planned swimming pool is an eflicient,
functional facility, designed for health, safety, comfort,
and recreation. It is adapted in size and shape for a variety
of desired aquatic activities, affords adequate deck space
and sunning areas, and is equipped to assure effective .cir-
culation, filtration, and purification of the water in the pool.
The present swimming pool boom, in large measure, is
owing to the public acceptance and approval of the marked
improvements in pool design and construction.

Until recently practically all outdoor pools were built of
reinforced concrete, but today a variety of other materials

ficial ice skating rink is a facility that is receiving consider-
ation in many cities today, but that was unheard of fifty
years ago. Its development is largely owing to the mild
winters in recent years that have curtailed opportunities for
outdoor skating in many sections where they were formerly
abundant. Artificial rinks assure satisfactory skating con-
ditions over a period of several months each year. Some
rinks have a concrete floor; others, of the roll-up type, can
be removed at the end of the skating season.

Multiple Use

The principle of multiple-use, although not entirely over-
looked in the planning of early recreation areas, is more
widely applied today. As more people acquired recreation
interests and skills, programs were extended throughout the
year, and as the problem of acquiring suitable space for
recreation became increasingly difficult, the need arose for
using all available space to the maximum. Ball fields are
therefore equipped with removable goals and bleachers so
they can be used for various seasonal sports; paved multi-
ple-use areas are marked off for a variety of games and
provided with removable goals so the areas can be used for

skating, dancing, or other activities. Some swimming, wad-
ing, and spray pools are used as game courts outside the
pool season.

Space limitations have also resulted in the modification
of various games. Softball, for example, has been designed
to enable a type of baseball to be played in a limited space,
although subsequent modifications have greatly reduced the
difference in their space requirements. Paddle tennis and
one-goal basketball are other examples, as are shuffleboard,
table tennis, and other games.

Recreation Buildings

Many recently constructed recreation buildings bear little
resemblance to those built several decades ago, either in
appearance or in nature and arrangement of their units. In
the early gymnasium, for example, gymnastic apparatus was
suspended from the ceiling, attached to walls, or erected on
the floor; and in many buildings a running track was in-
stalled around the perimeter to form a balcony. The modern
gymnasium, on the other hand, has practically no fixed
equipment on its walls and its clear floor is marked off for
a variety of games. Recessed bleachers afford an excellent
view of activities as compared with that from seats on the
elevated running track which is only a memory.

Creater emphasis is laid today upon functional design,
adaptability, and multiple use. Growth in the scope and
complexity of the recreation program has created a need for
recreation buildings that provide facilities adapted for spe-
cific recreation activities. Increasingly, buildings contain

rooms especially designed for arts and crafts, table games,
ceramics, or photography. Unlike many of the early build-
ings, present-day structures provide few facilities exclu-
sively for men and for women. On the other hand, in many
recreation buildings one or two rooms are allocated for the
exclusive use of a particular age group, such as teen-agers
or older adults. A somewhat contradictory trend, resulting
from limited building space, is to design building units to
serve a variety of uses. Ample storage spaces, folding parti-
tions, and movable equipment facilitate use of a single room
for such varied activities as club meetings, socials, lectures,
dances, card parties, and hobby shows.

Development of new materials offers possibilities in the
construction and furnishing of recreation buildings that
were not available a few decades ago. Formica, aluminum
and plastics, for example, are used widely in making fur-
niture, equipment, and furnishings that are durable, attrac-
tive, and easy to handle. Glass brick and translucent, glare-
proof, or reinforced glass of various types are used increas-
ingly for both the inside and outside of the building. In
many new buildings, rooms used for recreation are flooded
with light from large expanses of glass wall. ~

Cooperative Planning

F'.

The movement to open school buildings for use by com-
munity groups had its start early in the century, although
widespread acceptance has come about only in recent years.
Little emphasis was placed, however, upon the design of
schools for community use or for cooperative planning by
school and recreation authorities of facilities intended for
both school and community use. One of the most signifi-
cant and promising deveIOpments in the past decade has
been the growing recognition that such c00perative plan-
ning is essential and the increasing tendency of school and
recreation agencies to enter into agreements to make such
planning effective. As a result, indoor and outdoor recrea-
tion facilities are being jointly acquired, designed, de-
veloped, and operated by school and recreation authorities.
Such action has resulted in better planned areas and facili-
ties, more effective programs, and a marked saving for the ‘
taxpayer.

Rapidly expanding leisure, growing interest in recreation,
marked advance in the creation of new materials, and man’s
ingenuity in devising new forms of recreation—all point to

the probability of unprecedented development of recreation
areas and facilities in the years ahead. I

RECREATION

Charles Mulford Robinson

 

“I leave to the children the blossoms of the woods. . . .

WHY SHOULD there be landscape gardening in children’s
playgrounds? Do you remember the legacies con-
tained in a document published, said to be the will of a hand-
icapped person of Cook County, Illinois? These were his
bequests to children: “I leave to children, all and every, the

flowers of the field, and the blossoms of the woods, and the.

right to play among them freely, according to the customs
of children, warning them at the same time against thistles
and thorns—and I leave the children the long, long days to
be merry in, in a thousand ways. I devise to boys, ointly,
all the useful idle fields and commons where ball may be
played; all pleasant waters where one may swim; all snow-
clad hills where one may coast, and all streams and ponds
where one may fish, or where, when grim winter comes, one
may skate; to have and to hold the same for the period of
their boyhood.”

Now, as soon as a city becomes of such size that there are
a great many children, multitudesiof boys and of girls, there
are not left any flowers and fields and woods. The “idle
fields and commons,” the pleasant waters where one may
freely swim, snow-clad hills where one may coast, or skate,
are so far away as to be inaccessible, quite out of the chil-
dren’s world as far as practical usefulness goes. It is to sup-
ply their want that playgrounds are created. That is why
the grounds are equipped with balllields, swimming pools,

toboggan slides, and skating ponds. We are only trying to
give to childhood, city-born as well as country, its rightful
heritage.

It has been found by eXperiment that it is easier, cheaper,

by bringing into the city little oases of country, that shall
be the children’s own and that they can use every day, than
once in a long while to take them out to the real country.
But in bringing these playground oases of country into
town, it is strange how often we have forgotten “the flowers
of the fields and the blossoms of the woods”————the very first
articles which the person itemized as a legacy “to children,
all and every.” We have provided toys and games and
brought in the opportunities for sport of various sort, but
we have forgotten the flowers. Yet never was child, boy or
girl, taken for the first time into the country and left alone
who did not go at once for the flowers. Before ball is tossed
or race is run, starved little hands clutch for buttercups
and daisies.

It is a curious thing that we makers of playgrounds have
so commonly overlooked the flowers; have fancied that
any old vacant lot, however bare, would perform its full
playground function of giving chance for the play of mus-
cles. For when we build parks, which are only bigger play-
grounds for bigger people—the making accessible for grown
folk of some larger bits of country—the flowers and the
beauty of landscape are the first things thought of. That is,
when we plan for ourselves, we recognize that beauty is one
of the things most craved in the parks—to be thought of
ahead of golf links, or boating, or zoos. But when we are
planning for the children, to whom nature’s book never has
been opened, we tell them to run and jump, to learn bas-
ketry and the principles of civic government; but to look

29?

for nothing beautiful—even though, as consequence, the
seals never fall from their eyes and the loveliness of plant
life never be revealed.

It is a great responsibility to take. The propriety of bring-
ing into the playgrounds that beauty which landscape gar-
dening commands, even in the most restricted area and
under the most unfavorable conditions, seems to me over-
whelmingly convincing. But this other article may also be
advanced. In the parks, beauty and landscape find a suf-
ficient justification in the pleasure they give. Beauty rests,
soothes, and pleases us; but generally it makes us wiser. In
the playgrounds, where to its aesthetic attraction there is
added to the merit of novelty, it is also uniformly educa-
tional.

The very constituents of a gardening composition—tree
and grass and bush and flower—are delightful to a child,
even apart from the picture they may make. There is the
appeal of life to life. And think what, on the purely physical
side, natural shade and the freshness of living green may
mean, on a hot day, to the children of the scorching tene-
ments. In Chicago, where the playgrounds are the best in
the world, there is told a story of a little barefoot girl who
rang the bell at one of the fine houses and asked, “Please,
sir, may I put my feet on your grass?” Playgrounds are
too often developed on the theory that she would have asked
to swing on the area gate or to slide down the railing of the

steps, and never have noticed that there was grass. Yet the
wish she expressed was normal; and it seems to me that the
voice of that little child in the great twentieth century city
echoed humbly a thought of the Prophet Isaiah, when,
dreaming of a city beautiful, thousands of years ago, he
cried, “Awake, awake; put on thy strength, 0 Zion; put on
thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem,”-—and then in his

fine ecstasy, “Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste
places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforteth his peo-
ple, He hath redeemed J erusalem.” It is for us, as this little
child unconsciously asked, to comfort the children and ’re-
deem the playground by giving to it its beautiful garment.

There is, then, no consistency in the phrase I hnd in one
playground leaflet, “The maximum of utility and the mini-
mum of ornament.” Did you ever know a child who did not
love ornament and beautiful things? Shall we who pretend
to feed—and do feed the little bodies that are hungry for a
chance to play—give only stones to the starving s'pirit,
senselessly bragging of a “maximum of utility" in such
provision? We must redeem in order to comfort.

How to do this in a practical way, with the handicaps
imposed by the playground, is the second question.

It is the privilege of community-minded men and

women everywhere to work to restore and preserve for

all the people of America their right to play and
happiness. I

An early play leaders’ class, in New York City, being
trained in games despite the awkward length of skirts.

In. the Beginning. The National Recreation Association
from its beginning has been a leadership organization.
Among its many contributions to the individual worker and
the profession two stand out which are unique and charac-
terize the Association. They are (1) leadership and (2) or-
ganization.

These two elements were lacking until the Association
came into existence a half-century ago. Allied fields had
evidenced neither concern for nor conception of the place
and the role that well-trained, qualified professional lead-
ership was to play as the new field began unfolding and the
new career of recreation leadership was born. In fact, it
was not until many years later that these allied fields even
accepted the concept of well-trained professionally prepared
leadership for recreation and even yet, in many circles, the
concept is a narrow one.

Growth of Training

One of the first concerns of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation was in the field of training and professional educa-
tion. Within a year after its organization, at its first Con-
gress in 1907, the Association appointed a committee to
work on a course in play. After careful investigation of the
'work being done throughout the country and to meet the
demand for playground directors, three courses were or-
ganized: a Course for Grade Teachers, to train normal
school students and grade teachers to take charge of play
periods; an Institute Course in Play, prepared for those
entering playground service for only a short period and
for those employed without previous training; and a Nor-
mal Course in Play for Professional Directors.

l n 1909, The Normal Course in Play was published by a
committee of twenty-three members, of which Dr. Clark W.
Hetherington was chairman and Dr. Henry S. Curtis, sec-
retary. The work of the committee was carried on under
the auspices of the Playground Association of America.

The last revision of this publication was made in 1925

and the Introduction to Community Recreation is the
modern version of it. These two publications have been
widely used as texts in the many schools, colleges and uni-
versities training recreation workers.
Field Services to Colleges. As chairman of the Association’s
first training committee, Dr. Hetherington was well in-
formed regarding the problem. It was fortunate that a man
with his qualifications was available in 1910 and 1911 to
work for the Association in visiting a large number of
normal schools and colleges to advise with faculty members
about courses in play. At one time his schedule was made
out almost a year in advance. In later years Eugene T. Lies
of the Association’s staff gave similar service. During and
since World War II, the Association has increased this
service to the schools through personal visits by members
of the personnel and field staffs, through special publica-
tions, committee work, and special meetings.

In 1911 the Chicago Training School for Playground.»
Workers was opened and after a couple of years became a
part of the Chicago School of Civics and PhilanthrOpyq'
Later it was associated with Hull House and the department
of sociology of Northwestern University before fading away
into the history of training. A few years later another train-
ing project of short duration was established by the Peo-
ple’s Institute of New York in 1916. A school for community I
workers, it consisted of a one-year course for professional
work in community centers, social settlements, and child
welfare centers.

Training Institutes. In order to make recreation service
more effective in World War I, local intensive “training
institutes” were conducted by the Association, and in 1918
the Local Social Recreation and Games Training Institutes
were established. Later, specialists in music, drama, nature,
and crafts were added to the staff, as the recreation move-
ment eXpanded and demand for training increased. At one
time four full-time workers were kept busy conducting
training for workers among rural people.

Community Recreation Schools. The first one was held in'

RECREATION

Gmwth of a Profession

Willard C. Sutherland

March 1920. These were continued into 1926 and an aver-
age of thirty-five students attended each of the twenty-six
schools. They were a cooperative undertaking in an effort
to build up the profession. The essentials were covered in
these six-week training periods and individual workers were
prepared further for their assignments.

National Recreation School. Because of the favorable re-
sponse to these various efforts to prepare leaders for recre-
ation service, many felt, after twenty years, that the Asso-
ciation’s experience in this specialized field, with its accumu-
lation of material on all phases of recreation and personal
contact with hundreds of local communities, should be made
available for those interested in advanced training. Conse-
quently, the National Recreation School for Professional
Graduate Training was established in 1926 and, as in the
community recreation schools, the enrollment was limited
to approximately thirty-five students. After nine years of
operation, this school closed in 1935 when the depression
was making it increasingly difficult for the graduates to find
the kind of administrative and supervisory positions for
which they were being prepared.

Apprentice Training. As the national professional graduate
school was closing, plans were under way for the training of
a more limited number of workers for top administrative
positions. Apprentice fellowships were made available in
1935 and continued until interrupted by World War II. The
candidates received a fellowship stipend of $100 to $125 a

a month from the Association and 'were assigned to well“

organized recreation departments for a year of rotated
work and study.

Training in Emergencies. A lot of things happened in 1935.
The National Recreation School closed, the apprentice train-
ing program was established, and a new type of training
institute was launched. The “new look” in institutes was
prompted by the need for more intensive training in the
field, with the workers right on the job. Hundreds of new
workers, without much previous training or experience,
were serving on recreation projects made possible by the
federal government’s emergency relief program. These and

Training institutes were established by the Association
in 1918; some were given at Bear Mountain, N. Y.

experienced workers alike crowded into the four-week train-
ing institutes which were sponsored by local agencies and
conducted by the Association. Literally, training had been
mounted on wheels and rolled out onto the firing line. These
major institutes embraced courses in music, drama, nature,
crafts, social recreation and games, organization and admin-
istration, and were staffed by the Association’s most experi-
enced specialists. From Labor Day 1935 to late June 1936,
a total of 3,823 students attended the sixteen institutes
held in the large cities in the East and Middle West.

The picture of in-service training in America, which is
so important to the personal and professional growth of
leadership, would not be complete without mention of the
in-service training programs of hundreds of local and state,
public and private voluntary agencies, the institutes de-
veloped in recent years by the American Institute of Park
Executives and by the special interest groups in industrial,
hospital, institutional recreation and outdoor education and
camping. These and many others add up to an enormous
total effort to improve recreation leadership.

In addition to the Association’s specialists for training
purposes, its current National Advisory Committee on In-
Service Training has developed up-to-date manuals for use
in training park personnel, playground leaders, and com-
munity center personnel. A special Institute for Recreation
Administrators will be introduced at the 1956 Interna-
tional Recreation Congress by the Association’s National
Advisory Committee on Recruitment, Training and Place-
ment of Recreation Personnel. Another major project of
the latter committee is a nation-wide internship program,
set up in cooperation with recreation departments, colleges
and universities, and professional students.

The total attendance for the National Recreation Associa-
tion training programs to date is about one-third of a mil-
lion. The Association’s contribution to the professional prep-
aration of individual workers through the years has been
a maturing and stabilizing force in the building of the rec-
reation profession.

College Training. The first studies of recreation courses in

301

colleges and universities were carried on by the early pio—
neers of the Association in the years of 1907 through 1911
by personal visitation to schools and through correspond-
ence. In 1925 the Association conducted a college recrea-
tion leadership study and, although the seeds of the Heth-
erington Committee had taken root with some two hundred
institutions reporting recreation courses, no major curricu-
lum was identified. The Russell Sage Foundation in 1927
published a list of recreation training courses which in-
cluded one hundred and fifty institutions, but none had a

recreation major.

Further studies were made by the Association and reports
were published in 1930, 1940, 1948 and 1954. In 1940 only
two schools that are at all well known today for a major
recreation curriculum reported major programs. However,
the demand for help from the schools increased and the As-
sociation, after consultation with educators and professional
recreation workers, published A Suggested Four Year Col-
lege Curriculum as a guide to colleges developing major

recreation curriculums.

In cooperation with the Southern Regional Education
Board, an agency of the Southern Governors’ Conference,
made up of the governors and leading educators of fourteen
southern states, the Association made a very intensive study
of the recreation leadership and training needs in the South.
The detailed report, Recreation As a Profession in the
Southern Region,1 includes a large section on professional

education.

The current situation in the field of training is strikingly
different from that prior to World War 11. Today, profes-
sional education for recreation leadership is reported in
the form of major curriculums in about sixty-five schools
located in twenty-seven states and the Territory of Hawaii.
Over half of these schools offer graduate degrees; thirty-
four have programs leading to a master’s degree, and seven

haye doctoral programs. Not only the quantity but also the
quality and character of training have changed. Graduate

programs are more numerous, opportunities are more evenly
distributed geographically, and specialized areas of recre-
ation education have developed.

A broader approach is called for and the Association has
enlarged its services to meet the demands of the changing,
advancing professional education trend. NRA field repre-
sentatives serve and work with the schools. Examples of
this new departure may be seen in the co-sponsorship of
workshops and institutes with colleges and universities for
the training of specialists and executive leadership. The
NRA headquarters staff has been increased and more
schools are receiving personal visits. Students are being
interviewed and counseled in preparation for entering the

profession in larger numbers. Schools are being kept up-
to-datc on types of vacancies and the demand for personnel

r -which helps to serve as a guide to curriculum adjustment
and development. Current information on professional

education is being made available to them.

cruitment, Training and Placement is another valuable in-
strument in the field of training. This committee is carrying
major responsibility for bringing the consumers of person—
nel, the agencies, the professional recreation workers, and

the college educators together. As a result, professional
education is becoming more realistic and is more effectively

meeting the demands of the field. The Association’s two
national committees on graduate and undergraduate educa-
tion, made up of recreation leaders and college educators,
are conducting research, planning meetings, developing ma-
terials, and in other ways helping to improve professional

preparation for those seeking careers in recreation.
These educational committees have helped with the devel-

opment of materials and in the conduct of studies which
have resulted in the publishing of their reports2 and of lists
of colleges and universities reporting major recreation cur-
riculums.

The three committees representing in-service training,
graduate and undergraduate education are made up of pro-
fessional workers and, with the Association, have under-
taken a long-range program dealing with projects involving
the development of materials on in-service training, under-
graduate education, and graduate education.

Growth of Service, Coordinating and
Professional Organizations

The recreation profession cuts across and is a part of
many other movements, professions and services; yet it
maintains its own identity and, although one of the youngest
members -of the professional family, it is fast taking its
place alongside the older ones.

Space does not permit an interpretation or definition of
the various services, coordinating and professional organi-
zations that have come into being to serve the recreation
interests. The National Recreation Association being a
service organization governed by a citizens’ board of di-
rectors rather than a professional association, serves in
a consultation capacity to the Federation of National Pro-
fessional Organizations for Recreation.

The NRA’s National Advisory Council is also an organi-

National Advisory Committees. These include committees
on: Program; Research; Administration; Recruitment,
Training and Placement of Recreation Personnel; Defense;

anon.

Growth of Leadership

In the foreword of the first issue of THE PLAYGROUND,
written by Henry S. Curtis, one of the four purposes of the
Playground Association of America‘was stated as follows:
“To register and keep account of trained playground work-
ers and facilitate the filling of vacancies.” This was in 1907,
and in the same year, Seth T. Stewart, chairman of the ex-
ecutive committee, sent a letter to college presidents asking
,their cooperation, and stating: “This Association proposes
to be a medium of exchange between the different munici-
palities and organizations carrying on playground work
and the colleges in placing their young men as leaders of
play wherever they may be needed.”

The above indicates how clearly the Association’s course
was .charted in the early days of its existence. The regis-
tration of professional leaders and the maintenance of their
credentials is one of the major functions of the Associa-
tion’s Recreation Personnel Service.

Fifty years ago, practically no professional recreation
workers were identified as such. In 1917, there were 3,000
reported; this number increased to 25,500 by 1932, and to
50,000 in 1948. However, these were mostly part-time and
seasonal leaders and only those serving in local public park
and recreation agencies.

Although somewhat embarrassing to admit, no one knows
the present status of professional recreation leadership. No
national study or analysis has ever been made. There are
various estimates of the total number of full-time, year-
round professional leaders. In the public fieldu—the tax-
supported full-time positions in municipal, county, state,
and federal recreation agencies and in government hospitals
and institutions—the estimates generally range from 10,000
to 15,000. If private voluntary agencies are included the

JUNE 1956

range may go as high as 35,000 to 40,000. In the latter field
many do not list themselves as recreation workers but prefer
to be identified as social workers and group workers in the
welfare field. Only in the South—where the two-year study
of recreation leadership and training needs analyzed, for the
first time, not only the number but also the type of recrea-
tion leaders employed full-time in public and private agen-
cies and in the various segments of the recreation profession

—is the real status known. The study revealed a phenomenal
growth.

Cooperative Activities with Other Groups

Thirty-two years after the National Recreation Associa-
tion was founded, recreation workers decided that there
should be a professional organization and, in 1938, the
American Recreation Society was formed at the National
Recreation Congress in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Members
of these two groups have served together on training com-
mittees through the years. Also, many training projects have
been sponsored jointly by the Association and state and
other affiliated society groups.

Members of the Association’s staff have also oined with
other professional recreation workers and organizations in
conducting training workshops and training conferences.

The Growth of Professionalization

The status of the recreation profession may be found in
large measure in matters pertaining to: the conditions under
which leaders must serve; the salary schedules that prevail;
the stability of employment and the acceptance of recreation
and its leaders by the public.

We are passing through one stage of professional develop-
ment. Perhaps it is the awkward stage of adolescence, but,
nevertheless, it is a part of the never-ending process of
growth and refinement. The recreation profession is evolu-
tionary in character and will continue to develop to the end
of time—not so much in a fixed pattern, but rather in ac-
cordance with changing demands of a dynamic society.

It will be aided most by the rank and file of the profession
who keep a steady shoulder to the wheel, by those who have
set standards for themselves higher than anyone else would
dare set for them, by those striving for excellence in their
work and concerned with their personal development, by
those whose personal and professional conduct on and off
the job are governed by moral values and principles.

Movements are under way by various groups and in dif-
ferent parts of the country, studying and trying out systems
for the identification of professional personnel. They in-
clude state certification, voluntary registration, civil serv-
ice, and others. Regardless of what legalized and compul-
sory standards for the profession ultimately emerge, it will
continue to be judged by the conditions that exist at the
point of individual performance and by the true qualities
that characterize any professional at his best.

We have a growing membership of those who are profes-
sionally prepared and possess the spirit of a great service.
We have a profession—and a mighty good one—with a
potential not yet fully conceived even by those most deeply
involved in it. I

Starting at a point near Sesser, Il-

their forty-hour water journey. The
winding trip took them through parts

ended about twenty-five miles north of
Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

Professionalism Through
Student Recreation Associations

“The student recreation association
is a real stepping stone in the develop-
ment of professionalism where the stu-
dents seek to fulfill their own needs and
those of others to better meet the rising
demands upon leadership for leisure.
Students do play a major role in this
aspect of recreation. Concern and en-
thusiasm must grow in this area if rec-

membership of nearly one-half of all
recreation majors. SBA is an extra-
curricular organization responsible to
the university and the All-University
Congress, student governing board.

“As part of its program, the SBA
annually sponsors a winter workshop to
complement the training in the recrea-
tion curriculum. This year the work-
shop included other interested students
in the college of education, fulfilling a
constitutional requirement that the or-
ganization serve other students on
campus.

“The workshop, a weekend affair
held at a camp near the university, this
year drew forty participants. The pro-
gram was based in large part on the
results of an interest-need questionnaire
distributed in advance to recreation stu-
dents. Sessions included creative dra-
matics, folk and square dancing, games,
mu sic and singing, winter sports, camp-
fires, poster-making, recreation career
opportunities, and the relationship of
the school and recreation.

“Resource leaders, obtained by the
student planning committee, included
recreation students with specialized
skills, and professional recreation per-
sonnel from the university and the com-
munity. Among professional personnel
from related fields were a commercial
artist and a music teacher.

“At the end of the workshop, each re-
source person was asked to make a com-
plete report of the things he felt bene-
ficial to the students in his session. With
additional notes taken by student re-
corders, this information was made into
a workbook and presented to every par-
ticipant for future resource and refer-
ence.”—DAVID H. HODAPP, President,
SKA, University of Minnesota.

Illinois Offers Unique
Financial Aid Plan for Students

Students in recreation may qualify
for an unusual employment-education
plan now being used by the Illinois De-
partment of Public Welfare. This plan
offers assistance to professional stu-
dents in a number of areas—including
recreation—which are of special inter-
est to the department.

. The employment-education plan pro-
vnles for a grant for a final year of un-

dergraduate study or graduate profes-
sional training, depending on the needs
of the profession and of the department.
This must be taken in an accredited
school within the United States. The
appointee agrees to work for one year
following training in the Illinois state
mental hospitals or.schools for the men-
tally retarded.

The Illinois Department of Public
Welfare pays all tuition and academic
fees, plus a stipend of between $175
and $235 for each month of training.
Certain travel expenses also are reim-
bursed. The stipends are not taxable,
the applicant is under civil service on
a merit basis, and the department ar-
ranges for summer work on request.

Complete information about the pro-
gram may be obtained from the Assist-
ant Deputy Director, Employment-Ed-
ucation Program, Illinois Department

of Public Welfare, State Office Build-
ing, Springfield, Illinois.

Try Scratch Board

Scratchboard is the name given to a
type of paper and also to an art medium.
It was first used by a lithographer
named Ross in the early 1800’s and is
still used extensively in commercial art.
The finished article can resemble a pen-
and-ink drawing in reverse and can
nearly resemble a genuine woodcut.
The process consists in coating a heavy
paper or board with ink and scratching
in a design.

Scratchboard can be fairly expensive,
so we have been experimenting to bring
it to a simple and inexpensive technique
suitable for all ages. You will need a
smooth heavy paper or bristol board
(two-ply is good to start with) or
smooth mounting board.* India ink
and crayons are needed, and also a
scratching tool. You can buy scratch-
board tools, of course, but a hat pin, a
small nail, a sharpened knitting needle,
an X-acto knife, or Old manicure scis-
sors can successfully be used to scratch
with. You can achieve a design in black
and white, black and one color, or black
and several colors.

your board or paper with an assortment
of colors in a pattern, then cover with
the India ink as before. Let it dry, then
begin scratching. Your scratched de-
sign should have some relation to the
color pattern underneath, but you’ll be
surprised and fascinated at the colors
and patterns that are revealed as you
scratch.

SO much for material and techniques.
Now what about the design? Try not
to separate arts and crafts into its own
little niche, but rather combine and co-
ordinate it with all the rest of your pro-
gram. As soon as spring comes, every-
one will want to get out of doors and go
for a hike or have some cookouts. When
you’re out, you can’t help seeing things
that make good design—leaves, ferns,
shells, or even the vegetables that you
bring for your stew. Make simple
sketches Off your hike, and at the next
meeting make the design for your
scratchboard. Don’t be afraid to try a
variety of ideas, techniques, and tools.
You’ll probably come up with some-
thing we never thought about. The fin-

pale yellow, covered the “paper with a
layer of yellow crayon, going over sev-
eral times lightly rather than once heav-
ily. This makes the crayon layer
smoother. Over this I painted an even
coat Of black India ink. The ink can
be made to adhere by putting a small
amount of it in another container and
adding a drop of mucilage. A word of
warning, however: only a drop of mu-
cilage, because too much makes the ink
crack as you scratch. Be sure to wash
your brush out immediately after ap-
plying the ink.

Checkerboard for Handicapped

A hospital patient at the'California
State Veterans Home and Hospital de-
signed and constructed a novel check-
erboard which makes it possible for pa;
tients to play the game with the board
on the floor. I

The oversize board is an oilcloth
sheet live and a half feet square with
sixty-four six-inch squares painted on
it in alternate purple and yellow. A

RECREATION

 

frame contains the entire equipment

which consists of a mailing tube on
which the board can be rolled up by
means of a crank under the shelf pro-
vided for the checkers. It weighs only
twenty-one pounds completely equip-
ped, making the entire game portable
for use throughout the hospital wards.

The checkers are circular wooden
discs measuring about four inches in
diameter. Each one is equipped with a
light wire loop so that it may be picked
up on a small hook attached to a four-
foot rod, and thus moved from square
to square as the game progresses.
These checkers each have a hole in the
center so that they may be stacked to
make a “king,” and the loop on the
bottom checker rises through the upper
disc for lifting and moving. However,
to simplify matters, special “king” discs
have been made, which may be used
singly, and are marked with a K to dis-
tinguish them from the ordinary men.

This equipment is especially suitable
for use with the handicapped because
partially paralyzed patients, or those
whose movements are limited by physi-
cal disabilities, are able to play and
enjoy the game. From the standpoint
of rehabilitative therapy it is both use-
ful and beneficial.—-—MAJ OR KENNETH

pital, Napa County, California.

Tampa Pro-School Program

The Tampa, Florida, Recreation De-
partment play program for pre-school
children is a most important phase of its
total recreation services. Six pre-school
play programs are conducted in strate-
gic areas of the city with the recreation
department providing facilities and lead-

JUNE 1956

ership. While designed for outside ac-
tivities utilizing available playgrounds,
indoor community centers are also
available in most instances.

Since the department believes that
parents should play an active part in
such a program, a real effort is made to
have every single parent participate,
serving as mother-of-the-day, assistant
to the paid director, planning special
parties and outings, and in many other
ways. At the beginning of each season
a three-day workshop acquaints the
mothers with all phases of the program.
In addition, the mothers of each group
are organized into a Mothers Club and
meet at intervals throughout the year,
not only to plan for the program but for
social get-togethers.

Example for Other States

Music, drama, painting, dancing,
sculpture and other fine arts had their
“day” April 21 through 29, when West
Virginia schools, colleges, churches,
arts institutions and similar organiza-
tions observed, on a state-wide scale,
the Second Annual State Creative Arts
Festival.

Although the core of activity was in
Charleston, the capital city, in towns,
large and small, people gathered to cele-
brate and give recognition to West Vir-
ginians who are working earnestly in
the arts and bringing distinction to the
cultural life of. the state. During the

nine-day celebration many Charleston
stores provided window space for art
exhibitions. The Children’s Museum,
Kanawha County Library, and the State
Capitol also housed leading exhibits.

Industrial Workers Included

Recreation participation in Louis-
ville, Kentucky, is increasing—and 172
of the city’s biggest industries and busi-
nesses are cooperating. They post sign-
cards highlighting city recreation ac-
tivities on company bulletin boards.
William A. Moore, superintendent of
parks and playgrounds, is directing the
campaign with the aid of local indus-
trial leaders.

One thousand of the cards are posted
by the firms each month. A survey
showed that these cards are reaching

approximately 100,000 workers.

than thirty dollars. Since the cards each
reach about one hundred people, Mr.
Moore feels that the cost of three cents
per card is a worthwhile investment.

This is a brief report of a research
project, conducted from December
1954 to July 1955, on the effect of rec-
reation on 139 chronically ill‘patients
in Bergen Pines Hospital, Paramus,
New Jersey.

The team of people making the study
was under the supervision of Dr. Ros-
coe Brown, a professor in the research
department of the School of Education,
New York University. Doctor Brown’s
report follows.

“Patients on two floors of the hospi-
tal participated in the project. These
I were chronically sick people, about half
of whom had been hospitalized for over
one year. There were sixty-eight pa-
tients, half of them men, on Floor A
during the period of the study. Their
average age was sixty-four; and most
of them were hospitalized because of a
neurological condition. 0n Floor B
there were seventy-one female patients
with an average age of seventy-two and
a half years. All of these were suffering
from general chronic diseases of old
age such as cardiac ailments, arthritis,
.diabetes, cancer.

“From a modest beginning, the pro-
gram at the end of the six-month period
included the following activities: par-
ties, movies, photo-tinting, bingo, social
games, music, newspaper, dramatics,
library, gardening, and grooming.

“The following aspects of patient’s
behavior were studied:

1. State of health as measured by: (a)
Medical Rating Scale, rated by the at-
tending physician; and lb) Self-Rating
of Health, the patient’s rating.

2. Adjustment in the hospital as meas-
ured by: la) Nurse’s Rating Scale,
rating of patient’s general cooperation
and adherence to hospital routine, and
lb) Patient’s Adjustment Scale, the pn-
tient's evaluation of hospital services,

routine, and personnel.
3. Personality pattern as measured by:
(a) projective personality tests such as
the Thematic Apperception Test and
the Sentence Completion Test; and (b)
psychological interview.

“The results were all rated on a five-
point scale ranging from 1 for excel-
lent to 5 for very poor.

“Complete data were available for
twenty-two patients on Floor A and for
seventeen patients on Floor B. It was
not possible to collect complete data on
all patients, some having died or been
discharged during the project.

“The data obtained were analyzed,
through the use of appropriate statisti-
cal tests, to determine the statistical
significance of any differences (i.e., the
extent to which any differences may be
chance differences).

“Although the measures of patient
behavior presented above did not re-
veal statistically significant differences,
there were some patients who showed
particular improvement in the person-
ality scale. This was not true of the

group as a whole, however.”
* '5' 'I' *

The amazing thing was that the re-
search showed no change in the pa-
tients’ behavior, mental and health
testing. Nevertheless, individual notes
kept by the recreation worker, Miss
Judith Fields, showed a change in the
personality and morale of many of the
patients. People who had previously
sat and stared at the walls came to
watch the movies and play passive
games. Stroke cases, who had not
smiled in months, beamed happily at
the music that was brought to them
consistently. Several patients who had
been completely depressed became in-
terested in the art of photo-tinting. For
those who had seen the ward before
recreation came to it, and then after-
wards, it is almost incomprehensible
to realize that in the actual research no

changes were noted. The most amazing
finis to our six-month research was that,
on the day we withdrew our recreation
worker from the hospital, the adminis-
trator told me that We would wait per-
haps a year before engaging another
—this time on the hospital budget. Ex-
actly three days passed when he phoned
me that the patients who had been a
part of the research were so upset about
the sudden withdrawal of their activi-
ties program, that they had created
every nuisance possible with their rela-
tives and friends, and were demanding
that a recreation worker be hired. The
worker was engaged, the hospital is
thriving recreationally, and to quote the
superintendent, Dr. Rufus Little, “My
hospital was once just a place to treat
the diseases and symptoms of my pa-
tients. Today, thanks to recreation, we
feel we are a thriving community.”

As Doctor Brown states further: “It
is of interest to note the impact of rec-
reation at Bergen Pines on the commu-
nity in which it serves. Where there
were few volunteers at the beginning
of the program, now there are many.
The recreation department is now a
regular part of the hospital program,
with the enthusiastic support of the
community and by the literal demand
of the patients.

The results of this project indicate
that the impact of a hospital recreation
program seems to transcend the effect
on the patients alone. The recreation
program appears to have a social func-
tion in the acceptance of a hospital by
the community and on the way in which
a community thinks of its sick. This
project has raised many interesting
questions which are challenges to the
recreation profession as well as to the
psychological and medical fields. It ap-
pears that further explorations of this
type should be conducted by the univer-
sities and hospitals of the nation.”

* * 46- 4(-

I wish I knew the answer to this ques-

tion: Are the tools available today'

for adequately testing the value of rec-
reation, or is it, perhaps, impossible
to test the morale and spirit of a per-
son? Only much more research will
give us the answer. I certainly would

be interested in comments from our
readers. I

Fun and Games

Margaret E. Mulac. Harper & Broth-
ers, 49 East 33rd Street, New York 16.
Pp. 329. $3.95.*

Miss Mulac’s books—The Playlead-
er’s Manual, The Game Book, and two
written in collaboration with Marion

S. Holmes, The Party Game Book, and
The School Came Book—are, or should
be, in the libraries of recreation leaders.
The first, in particular, has become
almost a classic.

Perhaps their effectiveness was not
only owing to the excellent materials,
but to the fact that they were written
for a particular audience, and so there
was a real reason for each game se-
lected.

This book, while adequate, lacks the
effectiveness of those others, and per-
haps this is because it tries to cover too
wide a field and to reach too diversified
an audience. For example, the chapter
on children’s parties is weak, and would
give a parent almost no basis for know-
ing how to plan a party for a four-year-
old as against a six- or nine-year-old.
0n the other hand, the chapter on “Fin-
ger Plays and Hand Tricks” is good.
The chapter on “Singing Games and
Dance Mixers” has the “oldies”-—-—-Mul-
berry Bush, Looby Loo, and so on—
that can be found almost anywhere. A
chapter on “Card Games and Tricks”
is good.

So it goes—a curiously uneven book,
with some excellent new ideas and
many old ones.

Our only serious criticism is the in-
clusion of two ideas in the chapter on
"Tricks and Puzzles.” These might be
used at a private party with a fairly
sophisticated group, but both can get
out of hand very easily and become
either risque or at least suggestive.
They would not be at all suitable or ap-
propriate for a church group, or for
many other groups including teen-
agers.

Even with this criticism, however,
the book is well worth adding to your
recreation shelf. An index adds to its
usefulness.

PUBLICATIONS

Covering the Leisure-time Field

First Boat
(How To Pick It and Use It
for Fun Afloat)

C. B. Colby. Coward-McCann, Inc.,
210 Madison Avenue, New York 16.
Pp. 48. $2.00.*

As Mr. Colby says in his foreword,
“A book is no substitute for a row, a
paddle, a sail, or a dash across the lake
in an outboard,” but this book is a val-
uable introduction to all Of them. It is
simple enough for youngsters to read
and understand, very clearly illustrated,
and is a really excellent explanation of
the parts of a boat, the methods of row-
ing, sculling, landing, sailing, and so
on. It also includes the major boating
knots, boating traffic rules, care of mo-
tors, sailing, and other pertinent data.
Especially good for pre-camp instruc-
tion, or dry land courses. Best of all, it
makes it all sound like fun. Young be-
ginner-sailors will love it. Recommend-
ed for your water program.

Other books in the same series are:
First Bow and Arrow, First Camping
Trip, First Fish, and First Rifle.

Jacks

Patricia Evans. The Porpoise Book-
shop, 308 Clement Street, San Francis-
co 18. Pp. 30. $.25.

If you were a little girl, or have a
little girl, or know a little girl—sit
right down and order a copy of this
delightful little booklet, just for old
times’ sake. It’s all there-—that wonder-
ful, age-old game played around the
world and down the years.

And if you didn’t see the other two
little booklets by the same author, H op-
scotch and Jump ROpe Rhymes ($.25
each), add them to your order. Miss
Evans must have had a wonderful child-
hood to be able to capture the charm
of these childhood, traditional games
so dear to small girls—and many small
boys, too. (Incidentally, they’d make
nice little Christmas gifts for just the
right people!) mar—r

How to Draw and Paint

Henry Gasser. Dell Publishing Com-
pany, 261 Fifth Avenue, New York 16.

Pp. 240. $.50.

This pocket-size, paper-backed little
book will be slipped into many a pocket
for a picnic or field trip this summer.
It is an introduction to painting—start-
ing with oils and progressing through
watercolors, pastels, casein painting,
and black-and-whites. It treats this
range of subject matter in amazing de-
tail for the size and length of the book.
Copious illustrations, many in color,
add to its attractiveness as well as its
usefulness. It is truly a fine handbook
of fundamental principles. Mr. Gas-
ser’s own paintings have been exhibited
throughout the United States and
abroad; he has taught and lectured on
art in many parts of the country and is
author of other books on painting.
(Available on your newstand.)

Songs for Sixpence

Josephine Blackstock. Follett Pub-
lishing Company, 1010 West Washing-
ton Boulevard, Chicago 7. Pp. 158.
$2.95.

It has always seemed surprising that
our profession that deals so closely with
children on an informal, voluntary and
friendly basis has contributed almost
nothing to children’s literature. Jose-
phine Blackstock is one of the excep-
tions. Superintendent of recreation in
Oak Park, Illinois, for many years, she
has written many books for young peo-
ple, in addition to plays and pageants
used in the drama programs of Oak
Park. Recently retired and now living
in Marin County, California, she has
used her new leisure to write what we
think is her very best book, Songs for
Sixpence, the story of John Newbery,
the first publisher who thought chil-
dren’s books should be gay as well as
instructive, and that book-learning and
fun could go hand-in-hand. ‘

Every child is in his debt, because it
was he, back in the eighteenth century,
who collected and published between
bright covers the songs and stories that
we know as Mother Goose. Very fit-
tingly, the most coveted award for chil-
dren’s literature in America is made in
his name and known as the Newbery
Award.

Friend of Samuel Johnson, Oliver
Goldsmith and David Garrick, he is
known largely through their writings.
Only one biography existed until Jose-
phine Blackstock gave him to the chil-
dren of America in this delightful book.
It has charm, humor and wit, is full of
human interest and the savor of excit-
ing eighteenth-century London and the
English countryside.

The publisher has printed the book
312

on the fine paper stock and with the
beautiful print that a fine book deserves
but doesn’t always get. The illustrations
by Maurice Bower have charm and vi-
tality.

Put this book on your Christmas list
for your own children, and your nieces
and nephews, but add it to your own
library too. Let’s hope Miss Blackstock
will give us many more books that con-
tain the true recreation philosophy of
enjoyment of living—Virginia M assel-
man, NRA Program Service.

Nature Photography Guide

Herbert D. Shumway. Greenberg:
Publisher, 201 East 57th Street, New

York 22. Pp. 125. Paper $1.95.

Those who read Audubon Magazine,
U. S. Camera, and others using unusual
photographs of wildlife will recognize
this author as one of the best-known
nature photographers. This book in-
cludes many beautiful and interesting
examples of the way he can capture the
delicate beauty of wildfiowers, the fra-
gile wings of butterfiies, birds feeding
their young, and so on.

Give this book to your camera club,
and it will keep members happy for
months. Use it in your nature clubs,
too—and for your camp program. It
is well-written, and is full of the love of
the outdoors as it is of technical infor-
mation. The chapter on making a nature
movie is worth the cost of the book.
Recommended.

The First Book of Caves

Elizabeth Hamilton. Franklin Watts,
lnc., 699 Madison Avenue, New York
21. Pp.62. $1.95.

Don’t ever think the series of F irst
books is for babies. It’s not. It’s for
beginners. And if this book doesn’t
make you want to go out and explore a
cave, nothing will! It’s full of the
magic of caves—«how they were formed,
the people who lived in them, their
history and legends.

And along with this colorful account,
safety and common sense are stressed.
The style is simple enough for a ten-
year-old to be able to read—but it does
not “talk down” to a child. Any group
or individual interested in the wonders
of nature will enjoy it. It will be ex-
cellent for nature clubs, hiking clubs,
hobby clubs, or for camp. Also, just
fascinating to read! Recommended.

Finger Fun
(Songs and Rhythms for
the Very Young)

Helen Wright Salisbury. Cowman
Publications, lnc., P.O. Box 9812. Los
Feliz Station, Los Angeles 27, Cali-
fornia. Pp. 56. $2.50.

A charming book that would delight

any mother, teacher, or leader of pre-
school youngsters. The finger plays are
illustrated from sketches of the fingers
of the little girl to whom the book is
dedicated.

The book is uncluttered. The words
and actions, as well as songs (words
and music), are well-spaced, easy to
read and understand. The collection is
unhackneyed. It includes some old
favorites, of course, but many that are
original, or not generally available.
We wish that the section on rhythms
had contained as wide a variety as the
sections on finger fun and songs.

Mrs. Salisbury is principal of an ele-
mentary school in Los Angeles and is
also a church nursery school superin-
tendent. The book reflects her interest
in and love for children.

Outdoor Education

Julian W. Smith. American Associa-
tion for Health, Physical Education,
and Recreation, 1201 Sixteenth Street,
N.W., Washington 6, D. C. Pp. 32.
Paper. $.75.

One of the foremost exponents of out-
door education and school camping, the
author is eminently qualified to write
on this topic. This booklet is an excel-
lent guide for those groups or commu-
nities interested in making education
a vital, enjoyable experience, both in
the classroom and outdoors. Well-writ-
ten and charmingly illustrated, it is a
valuable addition to the literature on
this subject. Its reading and film lists
increase its’ usefulness.
