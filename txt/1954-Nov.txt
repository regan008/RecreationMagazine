2 ECREATION NEEDS SALESMEN!

“Wait a minute,” protests a lo-
cal recreation chairman. “Shouldn’t
recreation programs come from the
needs and wants of the pe0ple? Why
do we have to sell it?”

We sometimes have to sell recreation
because folks don’t always recognizc
their own needs. This sales job is known
more formally as “educaton of tastes.”

Our toughest sales task is in the area
of cultural recreation. The term “cul-
tural” is unfortunate. Ask the man on
the assembly line what thoughts pop in-
to his head when you mention culture.
He’s likely to tell you he thinks of
Rockefeller in the art gallery, Mrs. Cot-
rocks adjusting her pince-nez for the
first act of La Boheme, and some stuffed
shirt snoring through Shakespeare.

It’s too bad culture has been used as
a“front”by some people who can afford
the best of it, but enjoy so little of it.
There are long heel marks leading to
every concert hall in America—left by
husbands who have been dragged there.

The same two strikes called on rec-
reation in general are also tossed at
cultural activities. They were thrown at
us from Plymouth Rock and from the
covered wagon trails. The Puritans and
the pioneers regarded play as not only
unnecessary but even sinful. The men
and women who “played” in those times
were shiftless sinners. They had to work
long days—to survive. We have a way
of carrying along ideas from one-gen-
eration to the next without asking our-
selves how the custom deve10ped, or if
it applies to our present needs. Some
people still think of play as unnecessary
and frivolous—just for children.

Another low blow to cultural activi-
ties is the idea, so often found, that
education is just a matter of teaching
kids how to make a living, rather than

 

MISS MADAR, director of UAW -CIO
Recreation Department, Detroit, was a
discussion leader on one of the panels
for the Recreation for Business and In-
rlustrial Workers meetings at the Thir-
ty-sixth National Recreation Congress.

NOVEMBER 1954

how to live. But education these days
shouldn’t be just the three R’s. The
schools—if they’re good schools—are
trying to educate the whole child. They
are trying to educate his body, his emo-
tions, his mind. But let taxes go up,
or let some parent think children aren’t
learning readin’, ’ritin’, and ’rithmetic,
and the cry goes out: “Cut the frills!”
The so-called “frills” are those subjects
which teach children how to live. It sel-
dom occurs to parents it may be the tele-
vision set and not the art class which is
keeping Junior from learning his long
division.

We wish we could sell recreation just
for its own sake. But even our most
idealistic recreation authoritics admit
we have to resort to sales gimmicks oc-
casionally—gimmicks like the dollar

Sign.

For example, maybe you, as a recrea-
tion leader, have never thought of your-
self as a mental health worker. But
prominent psychiatrists say you are.
They say that recreation is important to
the improvement of mental health. You
can’t put an exact price tag on what
recreation means to mental health. But
you can look at the whole bill we Ameri-
cans pay every year for mental illness:
one billion tax dollars! Any small
amount that recreation programs can
do to help prcvent the tragic waste of
human personality and the staggering
expenditures for rehabilitation is worth
the effort.

A program to aid better mental health
must be a balanced program. Letting the
workers choose their own activities is a
procedure we endorse. Why then, do
“creative” activities get left out? People
have the need to create. Why don’t they
rccognize it? Why don’t they demand
art classes, string quartets, and book
review clubs as eagerly as they do soft-
ball leagues, cribbage, and sewing?

There are several reasons for this,
reasons you need to know as a recrea-
tion salesman. First, because of the for-
mer emphasis by companies on all-star
athletic programs, the idea has grown
that team sports are the most important
activitics in industrial recreation. This

Editorial

 

rs

is not true, of course. Team sports are
only a part of the program.

Then we get back to the high-falutin’
picture of “culture” thought up by folks
who think they’re either too he-mannish
or too poor to bother with the fine arts.
You have to do a real sales job to con-
vince these fellows therc’s a place for
thcm in front of the casel, or in the
local chorus.

Another very common stymie to cul-
tural activities is the wrong idea that
you have to have talent to enjoy art,
music, and literature. As a matter of
fact, it may even be thc other way
around: pe0ple with less talent might
have more fun in learning, expressing
themselves, and enjoying their crea-
tions. It’s tough to convince people of
this. But if you have ever seen a finger
painting done by a four-year-old you
know beautiful art is not produced just
by trained talent.

Perhaps one of the best ways to get
intcrest going in these activities is to
chuck the time-honored questionnaire
which asks, “What would you like to
do?” Instead, find people who are al-
ready engaged in these activities on
their own. Recruit them as leaders, as
instructors. Give them prestige, reSpon-
sibility, and a chance to display their
talents. You may find they’ll rally the
rookies around them much faster than
any persuasion on your part.

The competitive aspect of these ap-
parently non-competitive activities
could also be used as interest-getters.
Contests and shows are almost sure-fire
for prodding folks into hobbies that
will be fun for them. Photography con-
tests, hobby shows, talent nights are ex-
amples of pleasant competition.

It’s a lot easier, during summer days,
to sell the local a softball team or a golf
league than it is to sell them a class in
ccramics. But crcative activities belong
in our program.

Let’s put them there!

Hospital Recreation Leadership

Sirs:

I have read and reread the most stim-
ulating article, “Professional Leader-
ship in Hospital Recreation,” RECREA-
TION, September 1954, and I want to
thank Dr. Edith Ball for her very tine
interpretation of the hospital recreation
leader.

We have needed this article, as it
gives the basic needs and aims of the
hospital recreation leader and tells a
tremendous story in a clear, concise
manner. So often we feel that we are
battling our problems alone; but, in
reality, the problems are universal and
must be worked out by all hospital rec-
reation leaders, through research and
more understanding and further inter-
pretation to the hospital staff, person-
nel, and community. Our status is be-
coming more secure as we find our-
selves integrated into the over-all hos-
pital program.

The article explains the professional
status and position of the recreation
leader, revealing the many qualifica-
tions that must be present in order to
sustain the tremendously diversified
program required by patients, of all
ages and background. Dr. Ball empha-
sizes that the future of the profession
will be stabilized by the leaders of to-
day, and that we must all provide basic
materials toward a firmer foundation
for future goals of hospital recreation.

Hospital recreation leaders should
avail themselves of this article for distri-
bution to hospital administrators in
their community. The article clarilies
the position, aims, and principles, and,
to the uninitiated, it will present a very
clear picture.

Sirs:

I have just read with interest Dr.
Ball’s article. She has brought together
into one short article many important
points about this “baby” in the recre-
ation family. I only wish her article
could be made required reading for
those who accuse hOSpital recreation
workers of “playing with the patients
all day!”

Few outsiders realize the great re-
sponsibility entailed in providing a rec-
reation program for those who are phys-
ically or mentally ill and the great pos-
sibilities for assistancew—or harm—to
these patients in such a program. Imight
add that few outsiders realize either
the great satisfaction to be derived from
service to the hospitalized. If they did,
there would be no diHiculty in filling all
job openings with well-qualified people
in spite of the low monetary returns..

Sirs:

Congratulations on your very fine
School Issue of RECREATION magazine,
September 1954. This publication is
particularly well-timed on our behalf as
we have just instituted a new course
entitled “Recreation and the School,”
now required of all physical education
majors. It is my intention to make this
issue required reading for this course.

I have asked our student book store

to order two hundred copies of this
issue.

Again our lieartiest congratulations
on this special issue. It will no doubt

be well received by educators across
the country.

Memorial Recreation Park
Sirs:

Due to the gratifying and outstand-
ing developments in the field of com-
munity recreation, I wish to pass on the
word concerning the realization of an
impressive project promoted by the
Borough of Crafton, a suburb of Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania.

As recreation director of Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh, it was my pri-
vilege to accompany a group of patients
to a picnic held at Memorial Recreation
Park of Crafton. The outing was ar-
ranged at the invitation of one of our
Cray Ladies, Mrs. T. R. Day of Crafton.
In previous years she had the picnic for
us in her garden; however, since this is
the first year of existence of Memorial
Recreation Park, she suggested that it
would be an ideal setting for the event.
It was the first “big picnic” to be taken

to the park, and it was delightfully suc- '

cessful.

The park is located in a wooded sec-
tion of Crafton. The property was pur-
chased by the borough and developed
as a community project through the
sincerc and effective c00peration of
groups and individuals. The park area
with its natural “woodsy” setting pre-
served, was easily traversed by the pa-
tients who were required to be wheeled
about in carts and by those who were

limited in their moving ahout on foot. !

NOVEMBER 1954

Roadways, paths, and the large well-de-
signed shelter were accessible to the
station wagons which carried our pa-
tients to the outing. A very desirable
playground, equipped with popular ap-
paratus; a softball field, located far
enough away from the picnic table area
and thc playground for safety; drink-
ing fountains and water faucets; ovens;
well constructed and fitted rest rooms
are among some of the featurcs in-
cluded in this project.

Memorial Recreation Park of Crafton
is an example of the admirable spirit
which is typically American.

ters from various organizations who

 .. . Jar- 3' , .
Virginia boasts more than fourteen hundred picnic tables in roadside units.

 '.'

YES, HIGHWAYS are happy ways when they lead through
the state of Virginia. From the Blue Ridge to the Tide-
water and from Yorktown to Cumberland Gap, the high-
ways of the Old Dominion are spotted with many delightful
recreation areas. This is the result primarily of the ingenu-
ity and foresight of H. J. Neale, landscape engineer, Vir-
ginia Department of Highways, who was one of the early
pioneers in the promotion and advancement of America’s
roadside development. For more than twenty years, through
the highway department, Mr. Neale has endeavored to ,pro-
vide for the safety, comfort, and pleasure of the touring
public. The treatment of roadsides with slopes properly
graded and covered with soil-protecting vegetation has tied
the highways into the beauty of the countryside; indigenous
flowering trees and shrubbery have been added to enhance
the native landscape.
Since we are here concerned primarily with the recreation
aspect of the Virginia highways, however, we will not go
into detail about the safety, comfort and beauty that have

heen so well provided. These are, however, very important .

parts of the total program.

While highway boards and commissions have questioned
the value of the spending of money on roadside recreation
features, the wisdom of so doing is well substantiated. High-
way traffic studies have shown that well over fifty per cent
of all automobile travel is purely recreational, and in the
travel season nearly two-thirds of the total traffic is recrea-
tional. More than half of the revenue from gasoline and

other levies against the automobile is therefore obtained
from pleasure travel. It will continue to grow as a source of
revenue. Consequently, the expenditure for recreation val-
ues and facilities along America’s highways is not only justi-
fied, it has grown to be an obligation.

The Virginia wayside program began in 1931, with a do-
nation by the Honorable Joel Flood of one acre of land sur-
rounding the Memorial Bridge at Appomattox River in
Appomattox County. Since then it has grown to include
forty-five waysides, more than 1,400 picnic tables and 1,249
historic markers. The majority of the waysides are less than
five acres, sufficient for two or three picnic tables and a small
fireplace. Ten are over twenty acres, with one elongated area
covering one hundred acres and bordering the Maury River
in Coshen Pass. The total area involved is 477 acres.

Most of the wayside parks are provided with parking
areas, tables, fireplaces and sanitary toilets. The larger ones,
in addition, provide drinking water and shelter buildings
and in some cases play areas. The George L. Carter Memori-
al Wayside on US. Highway 11, eleven miles west of Wythe-
ville, consists of twenty-nine acres, has a large brick shelter,
twenty-six feet by forty-six feet, with modern toilets, fifty-
four picnic tables, thirteen fireplaces, seven drinking foun-
tains, and a parking area that will accomodate three hundred
cars. This park is in constant use from early spring until
late fall. Being located in a rural section, it provides op-
portunities for various individual, family, group and com-
munity activities. There are only a few areas as extensively
developed as this but its popularity is proof of its value.

All of the areas and their improvements are appropriately
designed. Attractive signs are in native timbers, the shelters,

- RECREATION

comfort stations, picnic tables and ovens are very durably
and attractively constructed. The picnic tables placed along
the highways, of which there are more than fourteen hun-
dred, are invitingly and conveniently located for the traveler.
Each area provides an opportunity for rest, relaxation and
recreation. Every effort is made to locate thesc facilities on
heavily traveled highways and at such intervals or places as
will most adequately serve the public.

The larger areas, which have assumed the nature of a
county park, such as Carter Memorial, Amherst, Hanover,
Pittsylvania and Stafford, are supervised and maintained
by a caretaker who lives on the wayside, the others by the
regular highway maintenance crew. Each is periodically
cleaned up and all facilities and equipment kept in an A-1
state of repair. This has influenced the attitude of the user.
and he usually leaves it in the same good condition as he
finds it. In 1951 it cost $31,053.60 to maintain the 477 acres
of wayside areas. In addition, the 1,058 picnic tables located
on roadsides cost an estimated $27,508.00. All this was
an average cost of less than six cents per person per year.
Since then the per capita cost has been considerably reduced.

Mr. Neale says, “The public, in general, is very coopera-
tive. When trash barrels are available in close proximity,
most people use them. There are times, however, when wa-
termelon parties leave unsightly messes on the tables. Last
year (1953) we spent $68,692.26 on the maintenance of
all waysides.” An excellent set of rules and regulations for
the administration of the waysides has been adopted by the
department of highways. They cover every important prob-
lem that might be anticipated.

Mr. Neale, in speaking of the total recreation picture in
Virginia, continues: “Although a wayside of over five acres
might be considered far remote from legitimate highway
expenditure, the usc and safety valuc of these to tired motor-
ists fully ustifies the cost. When our major wayside system
was first established it was felt that the larger areas would

Wayside, are constructed to be both durable and attractive.

eventually serve as county parks as well as roadside rest
areas. As such, counties would operate and maintain them
in future years. thus relieving the highway department of
this responsibility. The county park authority act makes
this possible. It is my personal hone that this will be the
means of promoting a park in every county of the state that
does not have facilities such as national or state parks.

“The state highway commission is anxious to be relieved
of the responsibility of maintaining these larger waysides.
It is willing to continue to share the responsibility, insofar
as highway traffic is concerned, and I am sure will agree to
maintain small picnic-table sites along the highways on any
of these areas. We are most anxious to extend our recreation
dollar to other areas. to the end that our highways will serve
as veritable parkways, oining recreation areas with recrea-
tion highways—highways devoid of unsightly objects, free
from litter and trash, pleasing, restful and safe.”

The people of Virginia are fortunate in having a state
highway commissioner and a commission that appreciate
the value of recreation, safety, and comfort of those who
travel the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Roadside development, with its turnouts, rest areas, pic-
nic tables and waysides, represents another important link
in the over-all recreation opportunities in America. It is
important because almost. everyone is a user of these facili-
ties. With the rapid increase in pleasure drives, wcek-end
trips and touring vacations they gain a growing importance
each year. . Greater consideration shall be given their rela-
tive value to recreation, especially by_ those of us in the rec-
reation field.

Many states have gone far with this important phase of
recreation. Ohio, Michigan, Oregon, Texas and Florida, to
mention a few, have all done outstanding jobs. Many of
these have moved into an important role in filling in the
gaps at the local level left by state and county parks. In
time they will play an even more important role.

FOLK DANCERS,

Our American Jazz Tradition

 OTICE, at any American folk dancc

camp, how dancers perk up when
someone sidles to the piano and plays
boogie woogie. Watch how dancers
start swaying and swinging when some-
one puts on a jazz record. For, no mat-
ter how beautiful and spirited the fig-
ures they have been learning, nothing
really “sends” them like jazz. The rea-
son is silnple; it is our music, part of
our tradition, as jolly, earthy, and
lovely in its way as the finest in the Eu-
ropean tradition, and much more
catchy to us, since it is the music on
which we have been raised. It is high
time that dance leaders recognize this
great folk heritage of ours and use it.
.Even the few attempts to introduce
jazzlike rhythms into folk dancing have
gone over big, for example, in the
“Five Foot Two” mixer, “Sentimental
Journey,” “Tennessee Saturday Night,”
and, in the square dance field, “Ala-
bama Jubilee.” This indicates a hunger
among our folk dancers for jazz—and
what little effort is made to satisfy it.

do not have what it takes to appease
this hunger. While they have developed
interesting forms in various parts of
our nation, none are authentic in the
sense that jazz is authentic. Thcir Eu-
ropean ancestry is evident. And none
can affect an American crowd like a
haunting New Orleans blues or a hot
Dixieland stomp.

Jazz is our folk music, originally cre-
ated by our Negro people out of the her-
itage of white folks and their own Af-
rican heritage. From Christian hymns,
Bible stories, folk and work songs, Afri-
can chants and rhythms came our
beautiful spirituals, blues, and robust
jazz tunes. Europe’s music intelligent-
sia acclaimed jazz as something vitally
new and significant at a time when
America’s music intelligentsia sneered
at it as honky-tonk, predicting its early
death. Today a tremendous apprecia-
tive literature on jazz has been built up
on both sides of the Atlantic; books,
articles, papers and entire magazines
are devoted to the new music.

Like any genuine folk music, jazz has
stood the test of time. In America this
has meant survival and growth against
misunderstanding, outright calumny
and commercial faddism. Jazz has lived
through the “sweet” period of the

1920’s, the “swing” era of the 1930’s,
and the “be-bop” frenzy of the 1940’s,
and is now more widely appreciated
than ever. This should not be surpris-
ing for it has solid, earthy qualities typi-
cal of music of the common people
everywhere—the heartfelt pathos of,
let us say, “Vllinin'J Boy Blues” and the
lusty humor of “Sister Kate.”

The present period of wider apprecia-
tion of our jazz music has been errone-
ously called a revival of Dixieland azz.
There really is no revival, for authentic
jazz—since its birth about the turn of
the century—has never died. And while
there is controversy among azz lovers

as to what is authentic, just as there
is similar controversy among folklor-
ists, it may be said that the term Dixie-
land refers to the music improvised by
small groupsof jazz musicians follow-
ing a tradition laid down years ago by
southern Negro players, particularly in
New Orleans.

Like all folk musicians, jazzmen play
as they feel; they express their whole
emotional being. In jive lingo, they
play for “kicks” not for “chips.” A
small group, say six, will choose a basic
theme—it may be a slow blues like King
Oliver’s poignant classic, “Mournful
Serenade,” or a lively ditty like Kid
Ory’s “Muskrat Ramble”——and impro-
vise on it, individually and collectively.
They will create, as the mood dictates,
beautiful solos, harmonies, and coun-
terpoints, always in cooperation and
around the original theme. It is said
that the first spirituals were sung in this
manner by_ Negro slaves; individual
voices, feeling thc “spirit,” would sing
out and, alternately, the whole group
would join voices in a moving unison.

Folk jazz (New Orleans and Dixie-
land) is played today hy small groups
led by such musicians as Art Hodcs,

NOVEMBER 1954

Kid Ory, Lu Watters, Muggsy Spanier,
Eddie Condon, Sidney Bechet, Doc
Evans, Zutty Singleton and \Vingy Ma-
none. These men, players all, remain
truc to the folk tradition. Often the big
dance bands with big names do not play
authentic jazz, any more than the com-
mercial hillbilly bands play the genu-
ine mountain music of Appalachian
Mountains folks.

It is amazing, then, with our vigorous
jazz tradition that folk-dance leaders
lean on European patterns, hash out
new routines, or bemoan the lack of true
American forms. They are overlooking
the heritage of music, song, and dance
right under their noses.

Takc the exuberant jittcrbugging
sprcad all over the world by our irre-
pressible Gl’s, to the delight of dance
lovcrs everywhere. ch folk dances can
match its vitality, effervescence, and
rhythmic flow. It has a joyous adandon
all its own, vividly termed by its de-
votees as “out of this world” or “in the
groove.” It is one of the most creative
of all dance forms, allowing a couple to
improvise as freely as their enlivened
imaginations and charged feet permit,
and always in keeping with the jazz
music which “sends” them. It has re-
gional styles and even individual styles.
In it may be combined such standard
jive patterns as the Shag, Charleston,
Lindy Hop, Oklahoma Stomp and Fin-
ale Hop.

The grotesque acrobatics of some jit-
terbugs are not typical of the dance.
They are commercial excesses put on
for show, or are the publicity-seeking
stunts of a few screwballs. The same
extravagances occur among folk and
square dancers. See, for instance, the
article, “Whither ‘Western’ Square
Dance?” in RECREATION for November,
1950, and the flood of letters about it

in succeeding issues of the magazine.

Lloyd Shaw, one of our leading dance
authorities, has recognized the folk
spirit in jittcrbugging and has declared
in his The Round Dance Book that jit-
terbugs are the true folk dancers of to-
day; hut like virtually all folk dance
leaders, he leaves this American tradi-
tion out of his teaching sessions. As
far as I know, only one folk dance insti-
tute (a national recreation school) in-
cludes j itterbugging in its curriculum.

Some of the components of itterbug-
ging, such as the Shag, Charleston, Lin-
dy Hop, Oklahoma Stomp, and Finale
Hop, already mentioned, may be danccd
as separate patterns in their own right.
From them folk dancers may derivc
much inspiration and many ideas, to
say nothing of the fun in doing them.

Jazz has rollicking group danccs to
offer in addition to its couple and indi-
vidual figures. The Big Apple, a folk
circle that came up from the Negro
South, is a spirited example. In its cir-
cular “trucking” it has the communal
feeling of a European kale, and in its
“shine” steps it has the individual crea-
tiveness of jazz solos. Like the jitterhug
dance it has a variety of picturesque
patterns—Susy Q, Truck, Washboard
Stomp, Swing High-Swing Low, Peck,
Sissy-Pants, and more.

Unfortunately, northern promoters
and faddists took hold of the Big Apple
and it died from an overdosc of com-
mercialism. It needs to be resurrected
in its original folk form.

Another jolly circle dance, similar to
the Big Apple but simpler and more
routinized, is Truckin’ Around the
Mountain T and T. A Negro girl lcd it
with such jive gusto one afternoon at
a national recreation school that it was
called for at almost every evening party
of the school. Incidentally, this school
is truly folk, with people of various
races sharing dances, songs, and games.
Here, we may follow an example in
democracy originally set by azz musi-
cians who draw no color line but play
together as fellow artists in a superb
folk tradition.

Finally, we can draw from our Negro
peoplc today fresh vigor and novel
beauty for our folk danccs. There is
available for us the sophisticated jive
of urban Negroes,1nainly in the North;
and there is thc simpler tradition of the
rural Negro South. Just as white mu-
sicians cooperated in the development
of our azz heritage so may we cooper-
ate in the development of a folk-dance
heritage.

We are all Americans, after all, and

'should be proud of thc contributions

of our people toward a common culture.
Let us make use of a folk tradition long
ago hailed by Europeans as a new thing
of beauty.

A PROBLEM which every now and then
confronts the recreation worker
and, in fact, all agencies which deal
with children, is the child who is con-
stantly rejected by the group whenever
sides are chosen for a game or for other
organized activities.

After studying this problem at the
Pleasantville Cottage School, New
York, I found that most of those un—
wanted children were deficient in neuro-
muscular coordination and showed var-
ious degrees of emotional disturbance.
They lacked the rhythm and grace
which is so necessary in normal play.
The rest of the children felt that these
individuals were hampering their activi-
ties. Children are that way.

This bothered me and I kept asking
myself, “What is to be done with these
unwanted children?” Some way, some
answer had to be found whereby they
might become insiders instead of out-
sidcrs. Children need so inuch to cling
to something solid, something that will
give them security. Therefore we needed
to create some situation wherein they
would not only be accepted but in which
they would be given an opportunity to
work out this problem for themselves.

As in the case where a mother is
helping her baby to walk, the baby feels
security by clinging to the mother’s

hand. When enough security has been .

built up and enough practice has con-
ditioned the legs, the baby slowly be-
gins to walk by itself. There develops
an empathy, a feeling of shared close-

ness which enables the child to grow.

Composition of Group. After discuss-
ing the situation with the appropriate
departments at the school, it was de-
cided that there was great need for a
remedial activity group. For the benefit
of the child it was called the Beginners’
Athletic Club. The word “beginners”
had the same connotation perhaps for
the child as it has for the adult who has
been a wallflower all his life and is now
going to Arthur Murray’s to learn how
to dance. It was this word which forced
out of the child any feeling that this
was an activity for ugly ducklings or
for those who were “different.” We
were simply starting an activity for all
those who needed help. .
Referrals came from the social service
department, the medical department,
cottage parents, and activity workers.
The thing that drew children to the
group was the fact that they all had a
common problem; they all wanted to
learn so that the rest of the children
would accept them. This spirit helped
to create a strong homogeneity within
the group, which'lnanifested itself in
two very important ways. First, it gave
each child a feeling of belonging,* a
feeling of being wanted instead of un-
wanted; and second, it was a great aid

to the instructor in that it crystalized
and narrowed down his problem, his
purpose and his goal.

Aims and Approach. The aims of this
program were constructive; that is, to
build up, to develop not just ball players
or athletes, but something within the
child himself so that he would be able
to continue on his own. This something
perhaps could be identified as self-con-
fidence built up through achievement.
Achievement, however small the steps,
is supported at all stages by a guiding
hand of a trusted adult.

The first group of fifteen boys, whose
ages ranged from nine to twelve, met on
three mornings a week for sessions of
one-and-a-half hours. The program was
planned so that no child felt a stigma
in being in a special class; otherwise
the value of the program would have
been negated from the start. Everything
went along casually. A rating chart,
devised for each participant, presented:
(1) a medical report and a recommen-
dation; (2) a recommendation of the
social service department; (3) a daily
evaluation of the child’s activity in
terms of his physical, emotional, and
social develOpment. (It was significant
to note that the twelve-year-olds didn’t
feel out of place in the presence of the

to learn that it obviated any age barrier
between them.)

Let us take Oscar for example. I11
addition to his physical underdevelop-
ment, we saw in him a highly disturbed,
fearful nine-year-old. From his case
worker we learned that he was admitted
to Pleasantville for truancy. When he
did attend school, he did not relate to
tcachers or children, and was described
as a “non-reader, retarded, and mildly
unstable boy.”

_At our first meeting, I noticed that
Oscar was constantly blinking his eyes
and sometimes twitching his mouth.
This we knew to be a manifestation of
his severe emotional conflicts. From
his cottage mother I learned that he
wet his bed every night. He was fidgety
and sheepish. He bowed his head from
time to time and glanced upward
through the corner of his eyes to see if
anyone was watching or spying on him.

When I first walked over to him, he
cowered and lifted his arms to his face
for protection as if he anticipated an
attack. I extended my hand to him in
greeting, but he did not accept; he
kept backing away. Here was a child
with such profound inner conflict that
it affected his whole self—physically
and emotionally.

After he became aware that there was
nothing to fear he took his place with
thc rest and we were ready to bcgin our
first session.

The Program. My first problem was to
orientate myself so that I would be able

to reach these children. I had to speak
to them so that they could understand
each word, to talk on their own levcl,
to be very elementary. I had to estab-
lish a state of clarity which is so vital
in working with the confused child.

The first few sessions were devoted
to story-telling. The stories were so
planned that they wcre adaptable to the
problem at hand. For instance, they
were divided into two groups. In the
first group were,specifically humorous
stories to help the children “loosen up”
and put them at ease. In the second
group were those which illustrated the
problems of famous personalities such
as Helen Keller, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
and others who overcame physical diffi-
culties through their own determination
—-to fire up a spirit from within.

Their reactions to the stories could
be summed up by their most common
requcst, “Tell us more.” In order to
create a sincere interest in the programs
and involve the children in the process,
I gave them homework. This homework

became a contest in which a prize was
offered for the best true story of a
world famous personality who had sur-
mounted a serious handicap.

All this was gradually drawing the
individuals into a cohesive group.
Somebody was paying attention to
them; somebody wanted them. Without
realizing it, they were becoming part
of and contributing to an organized
program.

After the story sessions the next step
was to adapt games for the group.
Throughout the program emphasis was
placed upon fun and enjoymcnt. By
planning activities so that few, if any,
children would have difficultyinmaster-
ing the skills involved, everyone had
enough opportunity for healthy physi-
cal and emotional release and satisfac-
tion. It is significant to note that the
child chooses and usually accepts the
activity which has just enough hope and
challenge for him. If there is no chal-
lenge he may ignore and not attempt it;
if the challenge is too great he will re-

527

cede and make no effort. Where these
children .had been outcasts, unpopular
and withdrawn in morehighly organized
activities, they now were gradually de-
velOping a group spirit and a sense of
belonging. With emphasis on joyous
play rather than methodical instruction,
neuro-1nuscular coordination and emo-
tional satisfaction were attained.”

One of the games which we found
very useful and productive was “Snatch
the Indian Club.” This game is ideal
for any remedial group because it ex-
poses the child to many elements: first,
joyous play; then coordination, de-
liberation, alertness, spontaneous ac-
tion, sensitivity, and speed.

For the benefit of those not familiar
with this game, here is a brief descrip-
tion: Two opponents race from oppo-
site sides of the room toward the club,
which is inside a circle three feet in di-
ameter. The circle acts as a restrainer.
Any player who steps inside of the cir-
cle is out. The object of the game is to
snatch the club without stepping inside
the circle and get back to the base with-
out being tagged by the opponent. The
frequency of motion is small, therefore
it is very suitable for the unskilled and
neuro-muscular deficient. The spontan-
eous maneuvering for positions is
good training for alertness, delibera-
tion, and coordination when the snatch
is completed. The opportunity for spon-
taneous action applies to both children
——the one who snatches has to dash
back to the base, whereas the other
child must act quickly to tag his op-
ponent before he reaches his goal. You
will observe with amazement the devel-
opment of coordination when an activ-
ity is adapted for the child’s level.

During Oscar’s first tries in the game,
he either clumsily stepped into the cir-
cle or the other child tagged him as soon
as he snatched the club. After a few
days of this he jockeyed his opponent
into position, allowing him to snatch
the club so that he could immediately
tag-him. Here is an illustration of the

ence to the establishment of a sense of security

deliberately. I want to impress upon the

dence comes from the child himself there is
no point in attempting therapy because it will

development of deliberate action and
good muscular rhythm.

In addition to this game, we used
calisthenics and more complicated ac-
tivities which demanded skills and co-
ordination, such as jumping rope, mar-
ble shooting and ten pins. Then we
used a group of activities for body de-
velopment, such as passing the medi-
cine ball, first with two hands then al-
ternating from right to left hand. We
would go on down the line of activities
until we were ready for team games.

After a few months of games and ac-
tivities which demanded greater skill
and coordination, the change in Oscar
was very noticeable. He was a bit awk-
ward but he was very happy with the
group. This adjustment and develop-
ment was described in one of the cottage
mother’s reports: “For months after
Oscar came to our cottage, he was not
permitted to handle dishes. His dis-
turbance was so manifest that whenever
he carried a cup and saucer to and from
his table we would hear the continuous
rattle of the cup against the saucer, and
then inevitably both of them were splat-
tered over the floor. Since then he has
develOped much confidence and is not
as disturbed.

“He is slowly taking his place as one
of the group. Since he is the ‘baby’ of
the cottage he is not given heavy duties,
but is now waiting on tables. The en-
tire group is anxiously watching him.
When he reaches the kitchen safely,
without any mishaps, a cheer cracks
the silence of the room—and a broad
shy grin creeps over his cute face. He
feels at home, he is secure, and the
group is giving him confidence.”

After six months of remedial work,
Oscar gained enough confidence to en-
ter the football intra-murals. We could
see his fears disappearing, and he en-

 

tered the game with zest. The others on
the team were proud to have him and

he knew it; this insured his confidence
—-—the confidence which the boys and the
adults have in him and the confidence
he is gaining within himself. Although
Oscar was one of the smallest boys in
the football league he received a gold
medal at the end of the season for ef-
fort, and the same award at the end of
the basketball season. He even tried
for the junior varsity, although he was
not varsity material.

At present we find Oscar pretty" well
adjusted emotionally and physically.
He has no social fears; he is not with-
drawn. If a boy hits him, he strikes
back. He is an honor student in school
and is p0pular with the staff.

Conclusion. We have learned that:

1. Play is the keynote in the life of the
child; his whole life is in his play.
Therefore we are fortunate, in that we
can use this play as a therapeutic tool.

2. The success of the prOgram is de-
pendent upon two factors:

a. The willingness and desire must
stem from the child but the instruc-
tor can motivate and instill such a
drive.

b. The activities must be adapted
to the child’s needs.

3. With proper classification of chil-
dren and pr0per classification of activi-
ties, a degree of success should be possi-
ble for every child. It is upon the basis
of earned success that a great majority
of desirable social characteristics can
be built. This success gives the child a
sense of satisfaction and security which
is the answer to his problem.

A properly controlled and supervised
recreation program in a child-care insti-
tution sublimates and re-directs many
unwholesome behavior drives through
joyful play and competitive activities.
It is through play that the child creates.
The game situation: socializes the indi-
vidual, teaches him to understand and
get along with the group. It is through
the rules of the game that the child ex-
pcriences the essence of clarity, judg-
ment and self-control. By reSpecting
the rules, the child learns and practices
the principles of democracy, organiza-
tion and good citizenship. The respect
and observance of rules and laws of the
game is in essence the creative force or
conditioning behind habit-forming be-
havior and democratic conduct.

VERYBODY enjoys listening to barbershop quartets.
What fond memories they recall of the good old vau-
deville days when no bill was entirely complete without one
such close-harmony foursome. Today there is a great for-
ward sweeping surge in our nation and Canada to revive
this traditional form of American folk music.

Since music plays such an important part in recreation,
there is room for barbershop quartets in every public, pri-
vate, and institutional program. Barbershop harmony
points to new avenues of musical intcrest. Limitless in its
wide range of musical expression, it opens the door to stim-
ulating activity for the dormant musical talents within us.
It affords opportunity for creativeness, encouragcs fellow-
ship and relaxation.

Recreation leaders emphasize the carry-over value of cer-
tain activities. Barbershop quartet harmony gives the high
school boy as well as the older man much satisfying pleas-
ure. One never grows too old to enjoy singing.

Many may achieve the joy of creation through writing lyr-
ics of songs, others by composing and arranging the music
for male voices. The singers strive for satisfactory results
with phrases and endings embellished with fancy swipes so
dear to the ears of ardent barbershoppers. Although the
piano might be used to master the various combinations of
notes and chords, all songs are unaccompanied.

People ask, “What is barbershop harmony?” Observers
and students of music have been in search of the answer
for some time, but have'not yet formulated a satisfactory

one. However, barbershop quartet singing in an organlzed

manner came into being in 1938 when men who enjoyed
harmonizing met in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the invitation of
O. C. Cash. This meeting, which prompted newspaper head-
lines to ask “Is Barbershop Harmony a Thing of the Past?”
brought music lovers from all over the country to that city
demanding that barbershop quartet singing be preserved.
These men passed their enthusiasm on to others, and the

Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber-

shop Quartet Singing in America was founded.

Today SPEBSQSA numbers six hundred chapters with
a membcrship of approximately thirty thousand music-lov-
ing harmony singers. Within its fold are more than two
thousand quartets and four hundred choruses. Although its

name has becn the cause of considcrablc merriment, its
membership rolls reveal the names of former opera singers,
orchestra and band pcrformers, college and school music
teachers, choir and glec club singers, men of all profcssions
and walks of life.

The uninitiated may think barbershop harmony is easy,

crude, and mechanical. Actually it is'complex, diHicult, and
more exacting than other kinds of four-part vocal music.
Let the skeptics listen to a smooth blending phrase with a
few typical changes and slides as sung by a good barbershop
quartet and compare its voicing and blend with that of a
traditional type quartet. One soon undcrstands why the
confirmed barbershopper prefers to adjust various tonal
combinations and chords to his sensitive ear. It is this de-
parture from the conventional style of song arrangement
which has accounted for the enthusiastic acceptance of this
style of music.

Many barbershoppers prefer to sing by ear. Barbershop

harmony contains the elements of folk music, particularly

in its improvisional character. Because of its spontaneous
technique, its social values may outweigh its musical sig-

nificance.
Many municipal recreation departments are cooperating

with local chapters of SPEBSQSA. Inglewood, California,
has a happy relationship with barbershoppers who meet in
its recreation club. Alexandria, Virginia, turns over the
facilities of its recreation center to the singers of the com-
munity. Rouge Park Community Center in Detroit houses
the regular meetings of a suburban chapter. The recreation
department of Mobile, Alabama, invites the harmonists to
its recreation center; and in Huntington Park, California,
recreation oHicials reserve a place in Corona Center for
these singers. This number could be increased.

Park and recreation departments call upon the SPEBSQSA
quartets to sing at band concerts, civic celebrations, neigh-
borhood programs, playground functions, community cen-
ter gatherings, and holiday affairs. Local recreation execu-
tives could effect affiliations with the society in much the
same manner as study clubs, community choruses, and
photographic clubs are embraced in the community pro-
gram. They should investigate the advisability of organiz-
ing a local chapter as an integral part of their programs. A
cooperative approach could be worked out with existing
chapters to stimulate this informal hobby.

Those desiring further information concerning the so-
ciety, and a cooperative plan, may write to Mr. Robert Hafer,

SPEBSQSA now has available song arrangements made
by experts in accordance with exacting standards developed
and approved by the society. These arrangements give me-
ticulous observance to harmonic correctness in chord struc-
ture and succession, and pay particular attention to efiective
voice positions and movements. They are characterized by
a high-harmony part consistently sung above the melody
by the tenor, and sometimes by the baritone, and have lis-
tener appeal because of the liberal use of four-tone chords.
Under the society’s guidance, barbershop singing has come
a long way from the impromptu catch-as-catch-can vocal
wrestling traditionally thought of as barbershop singing.

Annually an international contest is held to determine
the championship barbershop quartet of the United States
and Canada. This follows elimination contests which are
conducted in fourteen districts of the two countries. At

Certainly recreation leaders,'civic-minded citizens and

A Noticeable Contribution

Corporations and advertising agencies, as well as founda-

importance of the work being done for America by the Na-

W. Herbert Allen, president of the Title Insurance and
Trust Company, who is the Los Angeles sponsor of the Na-

fund-raising activities for the Association asked Foster and
Kleiser of Los Angeles, a well-known national advertising
agency, for a contribution. Officials of Foster and Kleiser,
impressed with the Association’s message, “Help keep
America strong through Recreation,” arranged for confer-
ences with Mr. Allen and other representatives of the Asso-
ciation. They ofiered to contribute their facilities to getting
the message before thousands of California residents and
visitors. The result is a fifty-foot sign, to be displayed in
strategic locations for a period of months, which will carry
the Association’s vital appeal to American citizens for
their help through contributions.

for the third year on December 22, 1953.* It was the an-
nual Chanukah-Christmas Pageant, “Let There Be Peace,”
sponsored by the community recreation department. All of
the eighteen synagogues and churches in the Hollywood-
Dania-Hallandale area take part in the festival, marking
the most important events in Jewish and Christian history.
More than three thousand townspeople viewed the huge
pageant with its cast of three hundred performers.

The Chanukah part of the pageant, one of its unusual fea-
tures, depicted the struggle of the Maccabees to lead the
Jewish people out of captivity by the Syrians and to rededi-
cate their temple to the worship of God. Rabbi Samuel S.
Lerer and Rabbi David Shapiro wrote the script and the
Reverend Mordecai Haalman directed the choirs of Temple
Beth Sholem and Temple Sinai in those scenes.

 

 

*Plans for the fourth Chanukah-Christmas pageant, which will
run for three days, are now under way. I work with representatives
of our fourteen Protestant churches, two Jewish synagogues and the
Catholic church. The music, which has to be chosen very carefully,
is under the direction of a choir director selected from a diHerent
church each year. Life magazine is planning to send a representative
to this year’s pageant to take pictures with the possibility of doing
a story next year; and Drew Pearson also notified us last year that
if we gave him the story earlier this year he would possibly use it

in his column.—PATRICK J. HENEGHAN, recreation director, Holly-
wood, Florida.

The script for the Nativity scenes of the Christmas part
of the pageant was adapted by James Newman and June
Justice who directed the entire performance. Seventeen
Protestant choirs, directed by Martin Blackwcldcr of South
Broward High School, sang the familiar hymns and carols
which tell the old, old story, and a Catholic youth choir of
forty children played the roles of cherubim. Mayor Alfred
C. Ryll conducted community singing of carols following
the performance. Patrick J. Heneghan, director of the rec-
reation department, organized the pageant.

Great care is exercised in selecting the leading actors and
actresses. They must fit the roles in everyday life. Seven
months, for instance, were spent in searching for the right
girl to play the part of the Madonna. The search included
investigating the prospects thoroughly, lhe boys they dated,
where they went, and their conduct on dates. Last year,
for the second straight year, the directors chose Nancy
Slater, an eighteen-year-old Presbyterian high school senior.

The following program was successfully instituted in Kansas City, Missouri

INTERRACIAL POOL

Training for employ-
ecs of city-owned swim-
ming pools has general-

, 1y been accepted as a
requisite for the efficient operation of such public facilities.
Pool maintenance, hygiene, life-saving, administration, pub-
lic courtesy, and other factors are routine matters covered
by such training. In recent years many large cities have
added a new subject to those cited—intergroup training or
preparation for the use of the pool by all races or groups in

 

the community.

The question of racially-mixed swimming in public facili-
ties has long been controversial. Despite advances in the
past decade in over-all intergroup relations, some commu-
nities in recent years have experienced public riot and vio-
lence when integrated swimming was first initiated. On the
other hand, in other areas the situation was accepted with
good grace and democratic behavior. Obviously some posi-
tive influence or element, present in the latter case, was
missing wherever the disorders took place. The following
account concerns one phase of the efforts by one commu-
nity to develop that positive element and maintain an in-
tegrated swimming facility in peace and security for all
persons using it.

On June 14 of this year, the board of park commissioners
of Kansas City, Missouri, for the first time opened the Sw0pe
Park swimming pool to all residents, Negro and white. This
action climaxed a two-year federal court case against the
city by Negro plaintiffs aided by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored Pcople. Both the lower and
district federal courts had upheld the plaintiffs’ right to use
the pool. On October 12, 1953, the United States Supreme
Court denied a city-filed writ of certiorari, thus ending the
case in favor of the plaintiffs. The pool had been closed
the summers of 1952 and 1953 during the litigation.

For some months following the October 12 Supreme Court
decision, the city Commission on Human Relations, the
official agency charged by ordinance with the responsibility

of promoting intergroup harmony, had been attempting to
define this positive factor. By March 29, 1954, when the

cipal Commission on Human Relations in Kansas City.

532

park board, the administrative agency in charge of the pool,
announced that the pool would be open to all residents on
June 14, the commission was prepared to execute plans and
preparations designed Specifically to avoid public disorder
on the occasion of the pool opening.

In essence, these plans consisted of a three-point program
involving police preparations, pool personnel training, and
public education. The commission based the development
of the plans upon two principal premises.

The first concerned the assumption that the maintenance
of peace and security was a total community responsibility.
In those cities where violence had occurred, the subsequent
discredit and adverse publicity reflected on the entire com-
munity. It was logical to assume that the prevention of dis-
order was a job for all elements in the community.

Second, the initiation and development of techniques to
preserve public order was viewed as a joint cooperative
task, not necessarily the sole responsibility of the commis-
sion. Thus, police department planning became a coopera-
tive effort of the department and the commission, with the
latter providing resources and materials to the agency pri-
marily responsible for law and order. In the numerous meet-
ings and conferences held by the commission with various
public and private agencies, all concerned gave widespread
acceptance to both of these premises.

Pool personnel training, as distinct from police prepara-
tion and programs of public education, possessed a unique
importance. The employees, whether lifeguards, basket-
room attendants, or supervisors, would be meeting for the
first time new social situations involving pe0ple from both
races. It was possible that these situations would need the
utmost in understanding and diplomatic handling. The
final training preparations subsequently incorporated this
and other factors of intergroup training.

I

Commission planning for pool personnel training began
shortly after the October 12 Supreme Court action. A meet-
ing was called of the recreation committee-one of several
civic committees organized by the commission to assist it
with various intergroup problems—and a subcommittee ap-
pointed to plan a suggested training program.

In November the recreation committee, including com-

mission members, met with the park board. While numerous
civic groups had been exerting pressure on the board to
open the pool, the committce confined its approach to that
of urging the board to make a decision in sufficient time be-
fore summer to allow for adequate community preparation
if it was decided to open the pool. The board acknowledged
the suggestions and promised complete cooperation in the
event the pool was opened. It also suggested that the com-
mittee prepare a tentative training program for its consider-

ation.
From then until February, 1954, the subcommittee held

several meetings to develop a training program. Concurrent
with the actual planning, the subcommittee wrote letters to
park departments in those cities where trouble had taken
place as well as those which had resolved integrated swim-
ming successfully. The replies contained valuable sugges-
tions which were included in the final training outline. In
addition, the subcommittee broadened its membership to in-

were:

R. Paul Brotsman, assistant professor, Department Social Work,

Wadsworth, executive director, Kansas City Association of Trusts
and Foundations.

NQVEMBER 1954

 

It may be helpful to outline sevcral principles on which
the subcommittee eventually based the completcd program:
1. Agreement was reached, early, that the training program
for pool employees would be an intcgratcd program; that is,
intergroup training would be trcated as part of a program
dealing with all phases of pool maintenance. It was strongly
felt that the opcration of an intcgrated facility, from the
standpoint of good pool administration, was basically the
same as thc operation of a segregated pool.

For example, courtesy by employees was an esscntial not
altered materially by the skin color of the patron. Again,
preparations for the avoidance of friction between races
was basically idcntical to those necessary to prevent trouble
between members of the samc group.

2. The principle of having a racially-mixed staff was ac-
knowledged at the beginning. This was particularly em-
phasized as a factor of primary importance in the replies
from park departments in othcr eitics.

In subsequent contacts with thc park board, full agree-
ment was reached on this point. Park board oilicials stated
that, with the exception of the supervisory staff, all of whom
wcrc former pool employees, applicants for other positions
would be considered solely on merit.

3. Liaison between personnel and police authorities was
of the utmost importance. It was decided that such liaison
would be part of the training program in a session dealing
with collective group violence.

During this period of time, between Novembcr, 1953, and
February, 1954., the connnittce members made numerous
drafts of suggested programs, paid a visit to the pool itself
to insure full acquaintance with its geographic surrounding
and physical layout, and devoted considerable hours to
perfecting the final draft, completcd on February 18, 1954-.
The final draft recommended a program of twenty hours
of training divided into six sessions. The following subjccts
were covcred: (a) job classification; (b) finances and main-
tenance of pool; (c) history of the litigation; (d) pool
administration; (e) specific job instruction; (f) public re-
lations, including community reactions to integrated swim-
ming; (g) public hygiene and safety; (11) routine emer-
gencies; (i) intergroup emergcncies, including dcvelopment
and prevcntion of collective violence.

A list of available persons competent to cover the above
subject matters was attached to the program. In addition,
miscellaneous recommendations, covering points dcaling
with pool operations not feasible to include in the training
program, were attached.

I

A second program of six hours, confined only to inter-
group training was also prepared. It was agreed by the
subcommittee that this shortened program would bc sub-
mitted to the park board as an alternative to the twenty-hour
program.1

II

On March 2, 1954, the commission presented the com-
pleted training program to the park board which in turn

1 COpies of both programs are available from the office of the

Missouri.

accepted the premise of such training. It then delegated
details and implementation to the park board staff to work
out in c00peration with the subcommittee. Discussions be-
tween the park board staff and the subcommittee then took
place. After consideration of all factors involved, the follow-
ing items were defined:

1. Park staff indicated that the non-intergroup phases of
the twenty-hour suggested program were covered in training
given by supervisors to lifeguards and attendants imme-
diately prior to opening day. Since the supervisors had all
formerly been employed at the pool and were experienced
personnel, such training was not necessary in their cases.

Experience in Philadelphia

An experience in Philadelphia this summer, further emphasizes the
fact that careful organization of interracial operation, such as de-
scribed by Mr. Cremley, is a MUST. According to the New York
Herald Tribune of September 6, 1954, admission to Boulevard Pools,
one of Philadelphia’s largest, privately-owned swimming areas, was
made available to anyone with the one-dollar admission price——in the
wake of a court order forbidding restrictions against Negroes. Twenty
Negroes appeared. Said a spokesman for the management, “Many
of these merely paid the admission fee, walked into the locker room
and left. Only eight went swimming.” Total attendance for the day
was only about seven hundred, although for a hot Sunday it usually
would be around four thousand. The general manager of the pools
has been called into court to face contempt charges for previously
ignoring the court order regarding admittance of Negroes.———Ed.

 

2. Park officials at first stated that only three hours could
be allotted for intergroup training rather than the minimum
of six hours proposed in the alternative program. The
different points-of-view expressed on this matter were finally
resolved by agreeing to schedule three hours on June 5 with
additional time to be allotted the following week if necessary.
3. Because of time and financial limitations, the initial train-
ing could be given only to the supervisors. The supervisors
would then repeat the training to the attendants and life-
guards, mostly young people of high school age, in the week
preceding the pool Opening.

4. Agreement was also reached concerning the judicious
selection of attendants and lifeguards with reference to
attitudes. Selection was made by supervisors, all high school
teachers, from eligible lists prepared by the city personnel
department after processing applicants. It was agreed that
this point should be emphasized to supervisors prior to the
actual selection of personnel.

On April 22, the executive secretary of the commission met
with the Swope Park pool supervisors. A full discussion of
the training program to be given June 5 took place and
copies of the Schermer report on the 1949 pool disturbances
in St Louis, Missouri2 were distributed to the group.

III

On June 5, three hours of training were given to the super-
visors. Subcommittee members alternated in presenting
topical matter with limited time for questions and answers.
The topics covered in order included the following:

1. Background and chronology of the Sw0pe Park pool liti-
gation from the institution of the suit in August, 1951, to

2 The Fairgrounds Park Incident, a sludy conducted for the St.

Louis Council on Human Relations, St. Louis, Missouri, by George
Schermer, director, Mayor’s Interracial Committee, Detroit, Michigan.

534

the October 12, 1953, Supreme Court action.

2. Community reactions to public integrated swimming
facilities. In addition, other phases of the commission plan-
ning were outlined.

3. Physical and geographical descriptions of the pool and
surrounding park terrain with emphasis on specific locations
most likely to be areas of potential disturbance.

4. DeveIOpment of mob violence and effective counter meas-
ures of control. This portion included a full discussion of
the Schermer report.

5. Individual reactions to integrated swimming including a
discussion of the dynamics of prejudice as a motivation
for violence.

6. Positive factors, individual and group, promoting demo-
cratic behavior and respect for the rights of others as well
as for law and order.

The approach of those who made presentations was in
terms of teacher training. It was emphasized that super-
visors would have the responsibility to pass the various sub-
ject matters on to lifeguards and attendants. The latter, by
this time, had been selected and included Negro youths as
well as white. Regarding the prospect of additional time
over and above the three hours, it was not possible to find
time suitable to all the supervisors in the week following
June 5.

Police liaison, not covered in the three-hour session, was
discussed on June 12 at the pool itself. The police captain
scheduled to be in charge of the pool detail met with em-
ployees and outlined police preparations. Methods of com-
munication and coordination of action in the event of dis-
order were established between police and employees.

The pool Opened as scheduled on Monday, June 14. From
that date until Labor Day, when the pool closed, no dis-
turbances of any nature have taken place there.

It may be reasonable to assume that the training described,
limited as it was, together with other aspects of the commis-
sion program of preparation, have in some measure been
responsible for this observance of law and order in an other-
wise potentially dubious situation. Knowledge that pool em-
ployees, as well as police, could be competent to meet any
threat of disorder was widely disseminated throughout the
city and may have had a retarding effect on persons or
groups otherwise inclined to make trouble.

It would have been preferable to have had more extensive
training and more time allotted to it. The three-hour limi-
tation meant a neccssarily condensed presentation of t0pics
actually needing more detailed treatment. Audio-visual aids
of many types, for example, could have excellently imple-
mented the training. Also, direct training for all pool per-
sonnel would have been preferable.

In conclusion, some results other than the promotion of
law-abiding behavior may be noted. The experience was
rich and rewarding for those who contributed to the pro-
gram, as well as for those who received the training. Pro-
cedures and 'techniques were worked out which may be of
value to intergrOUp situations of other types, both in Kansas
City and elsewhere. In addition, it may have made many
persons “training conscious” and possibly provide a basis
for more extensive training in the future.

RECREATION

PROBLEMS of recreation and educa-
tion in rural life were discussed at
four conferences held recently under

the sponsorship of the California State.

Department of Education. Many ques-
tions relating to the function of rural
recreation, organization, facilities,
leadership, and programs were con-
sidered and recommendations were
made as to steps for meeting them.

 

Features of rural conditions and rural
living which are distinctive and neces-
sary of recognition in planning for rec-
reation were determined as follows:

1. Many times rural homes are quite
large and could be the centcr of neigh-
borhood activities, if this were en-
couraged.

2. Playground apparatus for physical
development is of minor importance,
since such natural apparatus as trees,
fences, and the irregular terrain often
prescnt opportunity for climbing and
vigorous physical activities.

3. Rural school buildings are usually
centered within the community and in-
clude many recreation facilities which
should be available on a year-round
basis.

4-. School district transportation fa-
cilities may be used, if authorized by
the trustees, for transporting childrcn
to the school, swimming pool, park,
playground, and/ or community center
after school, on weekends during the
school year, and during vacation peri-

sparsely populated rural areas.

5. Rural organization facilities arc
often suitable as attractive recreation
centers where programs are developed.

6. Farm pets, hunting and fishing,
swimming, winter sports, study of birds,
butterflies and insects, astronomy, and
gardening provide inherent.0pportuni-
ties for recreation in the rural environ-
ment and should be utilized.

7. The rural recreation program need .

not give much emphasis towards segrc-
gation by age groups and by sex, as
families normally participate as a group
in many social and physical activities,
and it is a normal pattern for boys and
girls to hold memberships in the same
clubs.

A number of recommendations upon
which general agreement was reached
were developed. Some of them apply
cqually to urban communities, but
others are distinctly related to the rural
situation. Major among them were:

1. That adequate recreation services,
under properly constituted public au-
thority and with adequate public financ-
ing, be made available to all people
within the state. i

2. That every county and rural com-
inunity establish a legally authorizcd
recreation board or commission.

3. That all public authorities permit
full utilization of available facilities;
adapt present facilities for year-round
community use; plan, design and con-
struct buildings and facilities for year-
round community use, with emphasis
upon winter use.

4-. That thorough research and study
be initiated in order to establish es-
sential standards in rural recreatiorn.

5. That public and private agencies
cooperate in jointly supporting and
conducting a recreation training pro-
gram for professional and volunteer
leaders.

6. That adequate salaries be provided
to attract competent qualified person-
nel to the field of rural recreation.

7. That public schools make avail-
able district transportation facilities for
community recreation purposes, where
needed.

8. That the section relating to train-
ing for leisure, in the statement,
“Framework for Public Education in
California,” issued by the California
Framework Committee of the State Cur-
riculum Commission, be endorsed as
sound and comprehensive.

9. That state, county, school district,
and city governments cooperate in es-
tablishing, promoting, conducting, and
financing adequate public recreation
programs in rural areas.

10. That public recreation be recog-
nized as an essential governmental serv-
ice for rural communities.

11. That county boards of super
visors provide sufficient financial allo-
cations for the hiring and training of
personnel to carry on a wcll-planned
recreation program and for the main-
tenance and operation of such available
facilities.

12. That the planning of all public
recreation facilities be coordinated
through an appropriate local or county
planning commission.

13. That public school facilities be
made available and be utilized as cen-
ters for community recreation activities
in rural areas, and that future school
facilities be planned for recreational,
as well as educational, use.

the Christmas display.

0n the day before Christmas, Santa Claus bowed right
and left, his rosy face beaming as he progressed down the
streets of Belleville, New Jersey. He was being chauffeured
through town by the local recreation department, as a part
of the Christmas celebration. The department had set up a
five-point program with the object of filling Belleville to
overflowing with good old Christmas Spirit.

Santa’s vehicle was the recreation department pick-up
truck set up with a loud speaker so that, in between playing
Christmas records, Santa could laugh, “Ho, Ho, Ho!” and
shout “Merry Christmas,” to the children. He was able
to call many of them by name. In the Italian sections of
town the driver talked for Santa in Italian over a micro-
phone in the truck cab.

A large, red mailbox for letters to Santa had been placed in
front of the town hall; and some of the school teachers made
class projects of writing to Santa. Each letter dropped in
this was answered, and five of the writers were declared prize
winners. Santa delivered the prizes, in person, to the chil-
dren’s homes this same day.

In the middle of November the recreation department an-
nounced its home Christmas display contest. Anyone wish-
ing to enter the contest had only to phone the Recreation
House. Their names and addresses were published in the
local papers and all citizens were encouraged to drive around
the town to see them. Many, many comments came to the
recreation department to the effect that Belleville had never

had so much Christmas decoration; the idea really caught
like wildfire.

Starting also in the middle of November, a group of Bellc-
ville’s leading artists, headed by well-known mural artist
Robert Valentino and school art supervisor P. Webster
Diehl, were assembled for the purpose of creating a Christ-
mas display for the municipal stadium. The top floor of the
Recreation House, which is one large room, was set aside as
the workshop for the project. The display was made up of
figures about eight feet high, cut out of one-eighth-inch
tempered masonite. All of the figure groups were construct-
ed so that they broke down into sections not over four by
eight feet for easy handling. The total display consisted of

Santa and nine reindeer (“Rudolph” was equippcd with a
Hashing red light-bulb nose), the Three Wise Men and their
camels, the Nativity, and a group of Christmas carolers.
This was all framed by two eighteen-foot Christmas trees
which were trimmed with blue lights. The monocolor trim-
ming of the trees was important so as not to detract from the
beautiful colors of the painted display.

Many of the town residents made family trips to the sta-
dium to see this striking achievement. The entire display
was well lighted by thousand-watt floodlights, and a hidden
spotlight gave the Christ Child an effect of emanating
light. The display was exhibited from the first week in De-
cember until Twelfth Night.

The vital part of the plan for the stadium Christmas dis-
play is that it will be a growing thing. Each year new addi-
tions will be made. For instance, an English strcet scene
will be made as a background for the carolers next year;
additional desert scenery and palm trees will be placed be-
tween the Wise Men and the Nativity, and a silhouette of
house tops will be built in under Santa’s reindeer. The idea
is to kecp the community in wonder as to what each year
will bring.

The fifth point on Belleville’s Christmas program is the
closing of the Christmas season with a Twelfth Night cere-
mony at the municipal stadium. Twelflh Night was worked
up into a real community observance. The street depart-
ment cooperated by collecting the Christmas trees which the
citizens placed on their curbs during the three days prior to
Twelfth Night. The local press cooperated with publicity, as
did the merchants by displaying posters. The Belleville fire
department and auxiliary were on hand with a Iloodlight
truck and pumper. The police department and police aux-
iliary were on hand for crowd control. As the crowd gath-
cred in the stands of the stadium, a trumpet sextet from the
high-school band played a medley of Christmas carols. Boy
Scouts from three different troops ushered and handed out
mimeographed sheets of words to Christmas carols. The
choirs of all of the churches in Belleville were on hand to
lcnd their trained voices to the ceremony.

As the program got under way, the recreation superintend-

ent acted as master of ceremonies, extending a welcome and
expressing thanks to all who had contributed to the program.
Each year a clergyman of a different church is the principal
speaker. This year a priest spoke on the religious and tradi-
tional Twelfth Night. Following this the master of cere-
monies introduced the winners of the home Christmas dis-
play contest who were presented prizes by Comrnissioncr
Elmer S. Hyde, director of parks and public property. Next
came community singing by the entire assembly, and as the
singing began, four torches were lighted out in the field.
The torchbearers who had been standing about thirty fect
from the pile of Christmas trees could then been secn walk-
ing in toward the pilc. The torches were thrown into the
mound of about five thousand trees, and the community
singing continued until the trees were burned wcll down.

Later, a personal lettcr was sent to each individual who
had worked on the program, the artists, thc trce collectors,
the Boy Scouts. A host of fricnds was made for the recre-
ation department, and the mission of filling the town with
good Christmas spirit had bcen wcll accomplished.

Out of the Christmas program came another hit of good
for the community. Among the artists who workcd on thc
stadium Christmas display were membcrs of an organizcd
group of seventy known as the Associated Artists of Belle-
ville. At the suggestion of the recrcation supcrintendent it
was decided that the top floor of the Recrcation House would
be fitted out as a regular artists’ garret. After the garret was
redecorated, the art group was given the use of the room
three evenings a week. The group has now offered to teach
children’s art classes, free of charge, and Bob Valentino, a
professional artist, is organizing a second art group.

The garret will also be used by a camera club now in its
formative stage.

The Belleville Recreation Department plans to keep thc
garret open every day and evening so that artists may come
and go, leave their work and return to it. Undcr this pro-
gram the town, already rich in artistic talent, will undoubt-
edly uncover much more, and encourage many semi-active
artists into greater productivity.

Study of Group Work and Recreation for United
Community Services of Metropolitan Detroit*

Review of Part V of the report by Lewis R. Barrett

Never one to do things in a half-hearted fashion, Mr. Bar-
rett in his study of community services in metropolitan De-
troit has carried a widely accepted principle through to its
logical conclusion with some interesting results. The prob-
lem'he tackles is one vital to community recreation: What
are appropriate functions of voluntary and tax-supported
agencies? Taking the thesis that tax-supported and volun-
tary programs of group work and recreation are “ . . . two
community supported programs (which) are both comple-
mental and supplemental to each other,” he declares:

Tax-supported recreation has accepted the responsibility of pro-
viding a floor of recreation facilities and services on a neighborhood,
district, community-wide, and regional basis.

As tax-supported agencies accept more and more responsibility
for the provision of a basic floor of group work and recreation facili-
ties and services, the voluntary agencies must be particularly alert
and sufliciently flexible to alter their approaches in order that their
facilities and services may he complemental and supplemental to
this basic floor.

Applying this thesis, Mr. Barrett finds that some voluntary
agencies (e.g. settlelnent houses) whose original functions
in the community are no longer needed in the same degree
or in the same location, have begun providing recreation
services and facilities as a means of justifying their con-

tinued existence. This, he asserts, fosters the public impres-
sion that the entire field “is full of duplication and ineflicien-
cy.” The voluntary agencies might more apprOpriately devote
their recreation efforts to services other than those which
can be met by the tax-supported neighborhood school rec-
reation centers; also the number of these neighborhood
school recreation centers should gradually be increased to
the point of serving all residential areas of the “social com-
munity.” He points out that,

N

. . . as education and tax-supported recreation provide more and more
of the basic facilities and services for normal play and recreation for
children and youth, other institutions and agencies should focus
their primary efforts on the provision of opportunities and services to
strengthen the entire fabric of family and community life.

‘ Those who believe that the neighborhood recreation cen-
ter should offer the basic recreation services to all the peo-
ple of the neighborhood would disagree with this division
of function on an age basis but would probably agree with
the implied principle that voluntary agencies have impor-
tant function over and above the “floor” of tax-supported
services. About half the report is devoted to consideration
of-individual agency services in the light of the proposed
policy.

Mr. Barrett cuts cleanly to the heart of the issue. He bases
his thesis on the facts of social change in this vast community
and the comprehensive planning and implementation of
plans for urban redevelopment, schools, and recreation
places are now under way. If we as citizens believe that gov-
ernment is to provide the “floor” of universally needed serv-
ices to people, then we should act on this belief and re-assess

A Municipal Service

Public Recreation as a Municipal Service in Alabama, by
Robert T. Daland, research assistant, Bureau of Public Ad-

ministration, University of Alabama, represents a coopera-

tive project of the bureau and the Alabama League of Mani--

cipalities. It reports the findings of a study in which
fifty-eight cities in Alabama reported on their public recrea-
tion programs, commenting on the fact that the amount of
money spent for recreation in 1952 represents more than
a three hundred per cent increase over the amount reported
in a comparable study in 1948. The author states: “This
record, in view of the tightening situation of Alabama cities,
is remarkable testimony to the value which Alabama citi-
zens place on this type of human service.

“Of the fifty-four Alabama cities having a municipal rec-
reation program, forty-one supervise the program through
a recreation board. . . . In some cases the recreation board
supervises only a portion of the total recreation program.”
Twenty-three, or more than one-half of the boards, have

five members. The membership of other boards varies from
three to ten.

Methods of financing recreation are summarized. Of the
total amount spent in 1952, sixty-seven per cent came from
municipal appropriations, twenty-three per cent from rec-
reation income and ten per cent from private donations.
Swimming accounted for at least a part of the recreation
income in thirty cities.

The report contains a discussion of the Special recreation
levy and points out that the advantage of such levy is the
reduction in fluctuation of the appropriation, with a result-
ing simplification of budgeting. It emphasizes, however,
that this advantage is largely illusory in the experience of
many cities because recreation is expanding and budget cuts
are unlikely in most cities:

A pledged revenue source, therefore, may soon become a ceiling on
recreation funds rather than a floor. Moreover, funds should be ap-
propriated for city functions according to need. not according to the
accident of increased or decreased productivity of some particular
revenue source . . . The advantages of annual appropriations from the
general fund have outweighed the disadvantages, if any, in Alabama
cities. .

Some cities and towns in Alabama have felt, owing to lo-
cal circumstances, that it would be better for the municipal-
ity to contribute funds to a privately administered program.
The granting of any public money to any individual, as-
sociation, or corporation, however, is forbidden under the
state constitution.

Cooperative Use and Maintenance of Recreation
Areas in New Jersey Communities

In an attempt to secure information as to the respective
responsibilities of recreation departments and boards of
education in New Jersey, with reference to the maintenance

ADMONIS‘I’RAI’IO

of properties used for recreation, Robert D. Sisco of Liv-
ingston, sent a questionnaire to school and recreation oili-
cials in sixty-two communities. Replies were received from

thirty-eight recreation departments and twenty-one hoard
of education oflices. In summary:

Recreation department grounds are used by the board of education
in thirty-eight communities; only seven report no such use. Muni-
cipal recreation buildings are used by the board of education in thir-
teen communities; thirty-one report no such use. (No attempt was
made to determine whether the recreation department owned or mere-
ly controlled the recreation building.) School grounds are used by
forty-three communities; fivc report no such use. School buildings

are used by the recreation department in forty-six communities; only
two report no such use.

No charge is made to the recreation department for its use of school
facilities in twenty-two communities. In the other communities the
rental charge in no case exceeds the normal operating cost. Custo-
dial fees and fees to cover the normal operating cost range from $1.00
per hour to $30.00 per night; six communities report $1.50 per hour,
two $1.00 and $3.00 per hour each. Others report amounts vary-
ing from $1.25 to $2.25 per hour. Of the cities where the fee is charged
per evening, three cities report $15.00 per evening, two report $5.00,
and the others report amounts varying from $3.00 to $30.00. No
charge is made to the board of education for its use of recreation de-
partment facilities in thirty-two communities.

The board of education is responsible for the maintenance of school
grounds in forty communities; in seven, a combination such as the
board of education and a town department has this responsibility.
It received maintenance help from town departments in sixteen com-
munities; in seventeen, it receives no such help. Only one board of
education is charged for the service. Recreation departments receive
maintenance help from other town departments in thirty communi-
ties; seven are charged for the service.

Pattern of Recreation Administration in Wisconsin

The Wisconsin Park and Recreation Society News Bul-
letin contains a summary of the results of a questionnaire
relating to administrative organization for public recrea-
tion in Wisconsin municipalities. The inquiry was made by
Dr. H. Clifton Hutchins.of the University of Wisconsin in
1953, and the following questions were addressed to fifty-
two recreation executives:

Are you employed full-time the year-round in public recreation?
What is the name of the board, responsible official, or agency which
determines policy for public recreation in the community? What is
the governing (tax levying) body which furnishes the principal funds
for public recreations?

Of the forty-seven responses, thirty-five were from muni-
cipalities reporting full-time year-round recreation services.
In sixteen of these, recreation is administered by separate
recreation departments; in twelve, in conjunction with pub-
lic schools; and in seven, in conjunction with public park
services. Ten of the sixteen municipalities reporting sep-
arate administration have policy making boards or commis-
sions; six of the seven park programs likewisc are under a
policy making board or commission; and all ten programs
administered in connection with the public schools are under
the policy making direction of boards of education.

The principal financial SUpport for public recreation in
nearly all of the communities reporting is derived from ap-
propriations by the municipal governing body; in two cities
from fractional mill-tax levies approved by referendum, in
one village appropriations come from school district funds,
and in another from both municipal and school governing

bodies.

THE PRESIDENT’S Water Resources

Policy Commission in its report,
A Water Policy for the American Peo-
ple“

areas to man. It stated:

recognized the appeal of water

From wading and swimming pools to rivers,
lakes, or ocean beaches, they are our day’s
pleasure or our recreation goal. To some, they
mean the chance to catch that whopper or to
bag the limit of waterfowl; to some, a refresh-
ing swim or boat ride; to others, they sug-
gest the competition of water Sports or motor-
boat racing; still others find ‘near water the
quiet relaxation and inspiration which high-
tempo living occasionally requires.

Visit any outdoor recreation area and watch
the people. Seldom do they scatter evenly
throughout the park but instead tend to clus-
ter in certain spots—most often near the wa-
ter’s edge. Fishing, swimming, certain types
of hunting, boating, water sports—none of
these is even possible apart from water bodies,
while the pleasures of picnicking, camping,
nature study, hiking, and pleasure driving are
much enhanced when they can be pursued
along river banks or lake or ocean shores.

A few examples of recent action at
the federal, state and local level, de-
signed to bring to larger numbers of
people Opportunity for enjoying recrea-
tion in water arcas, will illustrate'this
same appeal. The start of land acquisi-
tion at the Cape Hatteras National Sea-
shore in North Carolina, for instance,
was called an “outstanding achieve-
ment” by the director of the National
Park Service in his annual report for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1953.
The first federal project of its kind, the
Seashore is a c00perative undertaking,
made possible through the cooperation
of both state and private agencies. The
area, when fully acquired, will provide
more than 27,000 acres for the benefit
and enjoyment of the public, under the
administration of the Park Service.

The State of New Jersey took a signi-
ficant step in 1953 when it purchased

to assure continued protection of the
dunes, woodland plants, shore birds,
and animals inhabiting the area. One
of the problems facing the state in the
administration of Island Beach is to
keep it as an area of rare beauty, pre-
serve its distinctive physical character-
istics, and still make portions of it avail-
able for bathing, picnicking, and water
sports of all kinds.

Recreation benefits seem an assured
by-product of the development program
of the Power Authority of the State of
New York in regard to the St. Lawrence
Seaway. Plans call for the creation of
three recreation sites along the river
near Massena. One park, to be located
some fifteen miles upstream from the
dams, would be built and administered
by the Thousand Islands State Park
Commission. It would include a beach,
picnic ground, boat basin, and camping
facilities. The other two areas are at
the dam sites, each of which is to com-

turned ovei to recreation use, with pic-
nic grounds, roadways, paths, over-
looks, and other accommodations for

visitors. Construction of a parkway to
run along at least part of the twenty-
nine-niile lake is also under considera-
tion. These plans indicate that a sizable
section along the shore of the lakes to
be created will remain in the public do-
main.

Only a limited number of states have
the possihility of acquiring oceanfront
property, as in North Carolina and New
Jersey, but the Opportunity to acquire
and develop water areas along lakes and
streams for recreation is open to all
states and to hundreds of municipali-
ties. Bergen County, the last New Jer-
sey county in the New York Metropoli-
tan Area to dcvelOp a park system, has
made rapid strides in the last few years
in acquiring still available waterfront
properties. The transformation of a
stretch of over six miles of low-lying
land along the Saddle River into a ma-
jor recreation area for residents of the
county is a prime objective of the Ber-
gen County Park Commission. When
completed, the park will include thc
existing river frontage, augmented by
several artifically created lakes, to pro-

vide a much-needed boating and water

sports center. A central trail will extcnd
along the river and provide access to
the various recreation facilities in the
park. These include picnic groves, play-
ing fields, refreshment facilities, and a
wild-bird refuge.

In addition to providing an attractive
recreation area and preserving its na-
tural beauty, the development of the
Saddle River Park will eliminate a flood
condition that has caused great pr0p-
erty damage and inconvcniencc in the
past. This is accomplished through the
use of collapsible dams and weirs,
which make it possible to lower artifi-
cally the level of the river and lakes.

Overpeck Marine Park, a waterfront
property of some one thousand two hun-
dred acres, is another major Bergen
County project. Its development in-
volves the clearing of a large tidewater
area and the construction of a variety
of recreation facilities including boat
basins, golf course, Sports ficlds, water
amphitheater, model boat basin and
wildlife sanctuary. The project was fa-
cilitated through the construction of a
tidegate which prevents polluted tide-
water from being carried into the Over-

NOVEMBER 1954

peck Creek, and of a trunk sewer serv-
ing the municipalities bordering it. Ac-
quisition of land for the park, which
has been urged for many years, was
achieved largely through the gifts to the
county of municipally owned marsh-
lands and shorefront areas.

The acquisition and development for
recreation of waterfront properties havc
long been rccognized as significant civ-
ic achievement in a number of large
cities. Encouraging progress has been
made in recent years. For example, De-
troit owned only 101 acres in water-
front parks in 1940; twelve years later
it had 266 acres. 'New York City, which
owned only two beaches comprising
one mile of frontage in 1934, reportcd
sixteen and one-half miles of municipal
beach in 1953.

In Scptemher of this year Toledo and
Lucas County, Ohio, authorities madc
public a plan of port development that
calls for a comprehensive watcrfront
recreation area on the western shore
of Maumee Bay. The plan involves the
construction of two basins protected by

dikes and development of a parkway
parallel to the present shoreline. The

new peninsula area would join an exist-
ing park. The small basin would serve
as a harbor for the protection of small
craft, and the other basin would be dc-
veloped for general sailing and closed-
coursc racing. Early action on the pro-
posal was recommended.

Recreation developments along the
waterfront have not been restricted to
large cities, howevcr, and an increas-
ing number of small communities are
providing facilities for enjoying acti-
vities in, on and near the water. Pier
Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michi-
gan, was enlarged this year and com-
pletely redeveloped as a lake front rec-
reation area. The need for rchahilitat-
ing and expanding the park, which “had
hecome an outstanding factor in main-
taining property values in the Farms,”
was recognizcd by the voters of this
city of twelve thousand, who approved
a bond issue of $500,000 to provide
funds for thc improvement. The new
park has a lake frontage of eight hun-
dred feet.

As dcscribed in the Michigan Muni-
cipal Reviezv,** the new Pier Park will
provide the following:  separate
bathing and boating facilities; (2)
complete swimming and diving facili-
ties; (3) new sun bathing and swim-
ming pier; (4) new bathhouse with
modern facilities; (5) new and larger
sand beach; (6) adequate parking for
475 cars; (7) approximately double
the picnic area; (8) increased boat
mooring and launching facilities; (9)
complete enclosure of all land with
proper sea walls together with road-
ways, walks, promenades, landscaping.

Authorities and the public are be-
coming incrcasingly aware of the warn-
ing repeatedly made by the late J. Spen-
cer Smith, long the president of the
American Shore and Beach Preserva-
tion Association, that the nation was
losing the use ofits beaches through ero-
sion, pollution, and private sequestra-
tion. As he said, “Beaches are a part
of our national wealth, health, and well-
heing and should be preserved and im-
proved for the recreation of the people.”

NOTES {MW/4mm

Determining Policies

“Procedure in Determining Municipal Policies,” an arti-
cle by C. C. Ludwig in the July 1954 issue of Public Man-
agement, contains information that may well be applied to
the determination of policies in a recreation department.
The discussion of the roles of the city manager and the coun-
cil also suggests their counterpart in the respective roles of
the recreation executive and his board.

As Mr. Ludwig points out, the city manager and the coun-
cil must work together on the same subject matter, each
making his own contributions. For example, the city man-
ager prepares the budget; the council studies and revises it,
as necessary, then adopts it; the city manager thcn puts it
into effect.

Mr. Ludwig points out that because the work of the two
authorities is so intimately concerned, it is impossible to
make generally applicable rules specifying the province of
each. In addition to presenting plans and ideas to the coun-
cil, and keeping it informed on all municipal activities, the
concept of the city manager’s function has been broadened
to that of a community leader. As such, he is responsible
for giving the council all possihle assistance in studying,
reviewing, and finally determining city government policies.
He has acquired more responsibility for providing not only
plans and programs, but also advice, suggestions, and argu-
ments which will give the city council a basis for making
decisions.

In these respects and in others described by Mr. Ludwig,
the situation closely parallels the development of relation-
ships between the recreation executive and his board or com-
mission. He also makes some comments on the function of
the councilman, “He should be a good listener, judicially
minded, willing to cooperate, and aware that in the ideal
community the interests of the individual are subordinate
to those of the group.” The article merits careful reading
by board members and executives.

Results of Recreation and Park Consolidation

The San Francisco Recreation and Park Department has
issued a report covering the four years of its operation
since the combined department was created. It answers the
question as to whether the expansion in its facilities and
service has been accomplished in conformance with the man-
date of the people who voted the department into existence
in order that the highest standard of public recreation be

542

achieved with the greatest possible efficiency. The report
states: '

“On July 1, 1950, there were 827 permanent employees in
the department. Now, nearly four years later, with the in-
creased facilities and services accomplished facts, there are
817 permanent employees. Most of the reduction resulted
from the elimination of overlapping and duplicating jobs.
Also, the flexibility resulting from the merging of men and
equipnient of the two departments has made it possible to
cover more ground with the same personnel and thus do a
better job of maintaining the 4019.17 acres for which the
recreation and park department is IBSponsible.

“Prior to consolidation, parks and squares were not used
as supervised play areas, the former departments having op-
erated with, unfortunately, very little liaison. The former
operations were based on a tacit but sadly erroneous as-
sumption that there is an incompatible difference in the rec-
reation philosophy governing parks from that governing
playgrounds.

“San Francisco’s experience during the nearly four years
of consolidation has been the same as that of every other
metropolitan area where the administration of parks and
playgrounds has been merged—that parks and playgrounds
are anything but incompatible, that their joint operation
and maintenance results in increased services and sense-
making economies for the community.

“Duboce Park is an example of this. Large rocky areas
have been turfed and bushes and shrubs have been partially
removed, making organized play possible under the super-
vision of a playground director. Since supervision, attend-
ance has increased greatly and the incidence of uvenile dc-
linquency has been considerably lessened. Parents, mothers’
clubs and members of the district’s Parent-Teacher Associ-
ation have expressed unanimous pleasure and satisfaction
with the better pattern of behavior evidenced since the
changes in the park.

“In response to repeated pleas from various other dis-
tricts, the department is now requesting funds with which
to provide supervision for additional areas.”

.Better scheduling of athletic facilities has also been made
possible hy the merger. Former park department facilities,
such as Kezar Stadium, Golden Gate Park Stadium, Big

Rec, Beach Chalet Field, and the golf courses, are now fre-
quently used by recreation groups for various events and

play days.

RECREATION

In conclusion the report states: ‘. . . It is the considered
opinion of the committee that the consolidation of the two
former departments has now reached a ‘going-concern’ basis
both from the point of view of an eflicient and effective rec-
reation program as well as from the point of view of eco-
nomical Operation. The committee feels that the present de-
partmcnt has eliminated much of the cost and effort apparent
in the previously separate, yet duplicating, functions of the

recreation and park departments. . . .”

According to a report from Los Angeles, advantages have
also resulted from the consolidation of its local recreation
and park departments. An immediate change was noted in
that all playgrounds deveIOped under the Los Angeles Bond
Fund Program had a definite and pleasing parklike accent.
Trees and beautiful flower beds are in the new playgrounds
and old parks now sport playground facilities. A large
amount of Off-street parking space has been provided where-
ever playgrounds are planned.

Ten years after park and recreation services in Detroit
were consolidated, the president of the parks and recreation
commission stated: “We believe that the peOple of Detroit
acted wisely in voting to combine the parks and boulevards
and the department of recreation into the present organiza-
tion. From our own experience we believe the four-member
commission established by the charter amendment has prov-
on highly successful in directing the progress of our park
and recreation program.”

The report emphasizes the new philosophy regarding
parks, which is that they should not merely be looked at, but
used. “Play areas should provide not only space and equip-
ment but landscape beauty as well. Today, Detroiters can
play healthfully in parks and enjoy scenery and comfort
in playgrounds.

“Under the new administration, the trend has been away
from the large super park or play area and toward the small
neighborhood facility. . . . It is our belief that large park
areas suitable for family outings are a regional or even state
problem rather than a municipal one.”

In all three cities—San Francisco, Los Angeles, and De-
troit—-—-a marked expansion in areas and a remarkable de-
velopment of recreation facilities have taken place since the
recreation and park services were merged.

 

Improvement Projects in Philadelphia

Public improvements relating to recreation, totaling

p $19,937,628 have been scheduled for the city of Philadelphia
for the period 1954-1959, according to the Philadelphia
City Planning Commission. The distribution of the total,
according to types of projects is as follows:

Philadelphia has developed a monthly capital item prog-
ress report for the use of the city departments in submitting
reports on capital improvement projects. The form contains
the following headings, and the accompanying instructions
are printed on the back of the form.

1. PROJECT: A list of the projects for the year is sent the department
by the deputy managing director.
2. DATE OF ORIGIN: Date architect is authorized to proceed with the

preparation of plans.
3. ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE OF PLAN: Date architect estimates

plans will be completed.
4. PLANS APPROVED: Date plans are approved by the department

head.
5. BIDS SOLICITED: Date bids are solicited by procurement depart-

ment.

6. NOTICE To PROCEED: Date notice to proceed is sent to contractor.
7. AMOUNT APPROI’RIATED: Total annount of money appropriated for
entire project.

8. AMOUNT ExPENDED To DATE: Amount of money expended through

end of month report.

9. PERCENTAGE COMPLETED: An estimate of the percentage of the
work which has been physically completed. This percentage is not
necessarily related to the amount of money expended. For example,
fifty per cent of the total appropriation might have been expended
while only ten per cent of the actual construction work was done.
10. AMOUNT EXPENDED THIS MONTH: Total amount of money ex-
pended this month only.

11. PERCENTAGE COMPLETED THIS MONTH: An estimate of the per-
centage of total construction work to he done which has been ac-
complished through the end of the month reported.

12. ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: The date on which the architect
estimates all work on the project will be completed.

13. REMARKS CONCERNING PROGRESS THIS MONTH: A brief descrip-
tion of any progress or problems which the department head considers
significant enough to mention.

Three c0pies are made of each monthly report, which is
due on the fifth working day of the month. The original
and one copy go to the managing director; the third is re-
tained by the department head.

In cities where the number of capital projects does not
justify the preparation of a similar form, the recording of
progress, according to the headings used in Philadelphia.
affords an effective means of knowing at all times the status
of each subject.

AAA Baseball Leagues

The question of AAA Baseball Leagues was recently dis-
cussed by a group of municipal recreation authorities, and
the great amount of work required to service a league of this
type was pointed out. As one well known municipal sports
supervisor stated, “We have approximately eighteen hundred
competitive teams in the city and less than the top ten per
cent of that group can be considered major or anywhere
near AAA; yet, we spend sixty per cent of our time on this
small percentage. They give us more trouble than all the
others and they expect more. They expect to hog the best
diamonds. They expect the best playing times and condi-
tions. They are not only a lot of work, but they bring a lot
of grief as well.” He urged authorities to develop less spec-

tacular circuits.

SINCE THE PUBLICATION of articles on our youth council

here in Santa Barbara, in RECREATION magazine, Sep-
tember 1952 and December 1951, we have received a great
many letters asking us for information as to how we are or-
ganized and how we operate. We are therefore attempting
to answer all these questions here, in the hope and belief that
each city and town should and can have a youth center where
teen-agers can enjoy a sound program of activities which
they themselves plan and develop.

It has been the opinion of our recreation department per-
sonnel for a number of years that teen-agers will support
best a program which they themselves help develop. With
this in mind, we had a committee of teen-agers aid in plan-
ning and executing the program of our teen canteen during
1942-1944.

The facilities were too small for the numbers which turned
out for the activities offered at that time, and in 1944 a
youth forum was held to determine what could be done. At
this meeting it was brought out that a private recreation cen-
ter in the center of the city was for sale. The teen-agers
sparked a drive to raise funds by popular subscription for
the purpose of acquiring the center for community use.
They held work days, spoke to clubs, discussed the project
over the radio, and-canvassed the city. Although they fell
short of the needed total they had the city so completely be-
hind them that the project was underwritten and the center
acquired. After renovation of the facilities the city took
over the operation of the center through the Santa Barbara
Recreation Commission. The teen-agers were given a large
room to use exclusively as a youth lounge. They were also
given use of the other facilities such as the auditorium and
gymnasium.

In 1945, the recreation commission started to sponsor a
youth council which would plan the teen activities with the
guidance of two trained staff members. The council has
operated continuously since that time with but minor changes
in the constitution and by-laws. This is our present set-up,
and we think it can operate in any community.

We endeavor to conduct a program which gives each teen-
ager in our community an equal chance for participation.

ELSTON L. BERGMAN is the youth council advisor at the
Civic Recreation Center in Santa Barbara, California.

NW“ COUNCIL

Elston L. Bergman

With a council made up of elected teen-agers we find that
all segments of our varied population are represented. There
is no segregation; all members are invited to participate in
all activities. We do not charge dues nor do we charge initi-
ation fees. “The Rec” is open to all teen-agers.

Our program is set up weekly at youth council meetings.
Members are invited to appear at these meetings with any
suggestions they may wish to make concerning activities.
Our program includes dances and dance classes, revues, rol-
ler skating parties, hay rides, swim parties, football game
dances, participation in Semana Nautica and Fiesta activi-
ties and dances, lounge and fountain operation, cooperation
in community fund drives and Christmas cheer campaigns.

Each year over sixteen thousand teen-agers attend “The
Rec” dances. During the fall, we average over five hundred
and fifty per dance. Our activities, such as the “Rec Revue”
and “Miss Typical Teen Fashion Show,” attract over three
hundred and fifty per performance.

The youth council is not subsidized by any one; the
treasury is built up by the profit realized from the dances
and other activities. A donation of thirty-five cents is col-
lected at each activity. Many activities do not break even,
but these are offset by the dances which always clear a small
amount. We sponsor a fifteen-piece teen-age orchestra made
up of club members, and they receive sixty per cent of the
take at the activities. We pay a flat rate for the special
dances and shows. The fountain is Operated by the council
and the lounge is set up and equipped with jukebox, table
tennis equipment, television, and piano, all owned by “The
Rec.” The auditorium, the lounge and patio are reserved
for the dances every Friday. We also have the gymnasium
eacll afternoon for basketball, volleyball, and table tennis.
The lounge and gym are open each afternoon from three un-
til five and each evening from seven to ten. Our dances run
from nine until midnight.

All problems of discipline are acted upon by the council
at their meetings, with the offender being given the oppor-
tunity to defend himself. Punishment is handed out accord-
ing to thc offense and taking into consideration whether the
individual has been in previous trouble at “The Rec.”

In respect to cases of improper conduct by the teen-agers
in our city, we have been very fortunate; very few cases
have come before our council. This probably stems from the

RECREATION

fact'that the council, in deciding the punishment, is more
severe in handing out penalties than adults would be. As a
result, the members realize that positive action will be taken
against them for any infraction of our rules. Another rea-
son is that, since most people seem to feel that rules are made
to be broken, we keep rules at a minimum, but strictly en-
force those which are listed in our constitution and by-laws.

Our constitution and by-laws are such that they can be
used by almost any city. Members of the youth council are
required to sign these at the start of their term of oflice.
Very few changes have been made in the seven years since
their adoption. The constitution and by-laws follow:

0 “Employees and their
families who never be-
fore participated in
planned recreation ac-

ing in our craft work,”
says Robert Turner, rec-
reation coordinator for
the West Point Manu-
facturing Company of
West Point, Georgia,
and its subsidiaries, the Lanett Bleach-
ery and Dye Works and Dixie Mills, Inc.

The company’s current program of
supervised craft classes on a community
level has been in progress for nearly
two years in Alabama in the Chattahoo-
chee River Valley towns of Shawmut,
Langdale, Fairfax, Lanett, and River
View and for nearly a year at the Dixie
'recreation center in Lagrange, Georgia.

 

[embers of a family

:1 a basket project.

Go into the home of any one of the
participants and you probably will find
a number of items made during craft
classes prominently diSplayed, such as
copper or aluminum trays, embossed
metal plaques and pictures, woven reed
and wood trays, foot stools, woven waste
baskets, flower holders, or magazine
racks—to mention only a few of the
popular items.

Supervised craft classes begin each
October and end the following May.
Items started prior to May may be fin-
ished in the recreation centers, in the
participant’s home, or left unfinished
until classes resume in October.

Sometimes as many as thirty women
are present, at other times as few as
two; but the average attendance has
been high! Since last October approxi-
mately three hundred persons have par-
ticipated in at least two or more classes.
These classes have included members
as old as seventeen and as young as

546

seventy.

A special craft instructor, who travels
to each of the six communities for a
four-hour period weekly, has encour-
aged class members to begin work on
items which may be finished in their
homes during the summer without su-
pervision or help. Such items include
straw purses, paintings, many types of
felt craft, swimming shoes, metal-foil
crafts and basketry.

How can you participate in the craft
program? Well, it’s really very easy.
First, you have a desire to devote a few
spare hours each week to making a
craft item; second, you decide to set
aside several hours from your regular
weekly routine. Then you go to the
craft class in your community. Upon
arriving for the first time, your name
is entered on a card for record pur-
poses. You are under no obligation to
attend any certain number of classes;
nor are you expected to stay for any
particular length of time. You simply
attend when you can.

You can look over several items which
the instructor suggests as possibilities
for your first project. After the selec-
tion is made, the instructor orders the
necessary materials. Some come in kit
form, while others come as quantity ma-
terials by the yard or pound.

No money is paid until the order is
delivered by the instructor. The chargc
is the actual cost of the materials. In-
struction, patterns,‘models, and work-
ing facilities are furnished without
charge by the company’s Department
of Community Recreation.

After a few hours of continuous work
you complete your first item. If you
have made a copper log basket, the cost
of your materials has been approxi-
mately $3.50. You have devoted about

 

fiat-u; '

after she has eteberl the design.

ten hours to this work, but you have
finished an article which would cost you
ten to fifteen dollars in retail stores.
Should you select a less expcnsive item,
such as a figurine or plaster plaque,
your materials may cost as little as ten
cents, and your labor may take as little
as one hour. Your finished item would
cost from twenty-hve to fifty cents in
retail stores.

These inexpensive craft creations
make wonderful gifts for birthdays and
weddings. Many place aside craft items
for special giving at Christmas.

Recreation directors or their assis-
tants in each of our communities are
present during all craft classes to offer
whatever help may be needed. All six
communities have offered at least a
four-hour class each week, while one
community has offered as many as
twelve hours weekly.

To inaugurate craft classes last Oc-
tober, a valleywide craft show was held
at Sears Hall in Langdale. Each com-
munity group displayed articles com-
pleted during the previous year. A
similar event is planned for this fall.

During the past seven months the rec-
reation department has ordered for
craft participants approximately fifteen
hundred pounds of c0pper in sheet form
and over one hundred pounds of reed
in all sizes and shapes. These particular
materials have been the two most used
because of the popularity of such craft
items as metal trays and reed baskets.

The classes are not limited to women.
In fact, on many occasions husbands
have participated with their wives, par-
ticularly in those communities which
have night classes.

Suggestions appearing here were compiled by Miss Ward for use in a
Creative Drarnatics Workshop in Milwaukee in the fall of 1953, and
also have been used in the training program of the Department of Mn-
nicipal Recreation and Adult Education, Milwaukee Public Schools.
The Drama Committee, of NRA’s National Advisory Committee on
Program and Activities, hopes that this material will be helpful in
developing creative dramatics on playgrounds and in recreation cen-
ters everywhere. I t is used with Miss W ard’s permission.

CREATIVE dramatics is the playing out of ideas.
experiences, and stories with improvised ac-
tion and dialogue. It may be the children’s active
interpretation of what they have learned, not only
in literature, but in other eurriculum areas also.

Creative dramatics is informal—created by the
children with the guidance of the teacher or lead-
er. It is not memorized, directed, rehearsed
drama designed for the entertainment of an audi-
enee. It develops from the ideas of children. It
does not depend upon dramatic talent.

Its values are many. It contributes to the per-
sonal develOpment of the children who participate,
giving them: a channel for their creative imagina-
tion; experience in working together in situations
which strongly motivate cooperation; sensitivity
to the thoughts and feclings of others—the basis of under-
standing; emotional release through playing all kinds of
charaeters; mueh experience in thinking on their feet and
expressing their ideas effectively. It enriches, clarifies. and
intensifies learnings in various eurriculum areas, makes
faetual knowledge come alive.

“Rieh adventures in day-to-day living go far in building
well-integrated personalities.”

 

WINIFRED WARD has led the way in pioneering in the field
of creative clramatics; and her books, Creative Dramaties,
Theatre for Children, Playmaking with Children, and
Stories to Dramatize belong in every recreation library.

Creative dramatics, shown by at Mercer Island group, is an activity now
being stressed in non-urban comnlunilies in King County, Washington.

How To Introduce Creative Dramatics

Set the mood for make-believe by inducing a friendly, re-
laxed, confident feeling in the group. In order for children
to feel free in any sueh rhythmic expression, they should
have had experience in simple rhythms, such as marching,
galloping, jumping, skipping, and so on. These may he done
with the piano, percussion instruments, or records like the
elean-cut Ruth Evans Child Rhythms records.

For younger children one can use:

I. Rhythmic expression in make-believe situations, such
as playing chugging trains, galloping horses, lumbering
bears, Iluttering leaves—often with musie. (The NBC Rhyth-
rnic Activities records are good.)

547

2. Dramatic play with rhythm based on verses such as
“Hippity Hop to the Barbershop” and “Hickory Dickory
Dock.”

3. Verses with music, the music setting the mood and the
rhythmic pattern. (The Sing-Song, published by The Mac-
millan Company, is an excellent collection of such material.
Songs From Around A Toadstool Table, published by the
Follett Publishing Company, has charming poems that are
fresh and imaginative. Time for Poetry, published by Scott
Foresman and Company is another excellent collection.)

For older children the range of expression can be ex-
tended even further with:

1. Pantomimes of activities, often for others to guess,
such as: (a) activities at camp or at a picnic; (b) all sorts
of people collecting on a corner for a bus; (0) funny things
that happen to pe0ple on a windy day.

2. Pantomimes involving the five senses, as: (a) smell-
ing something, searching for and finding it, indicating
whether or not you like it; (b) tasting a delicious warm
cooky, a very sour pickle, some hot chocolate; (0) picking
up a soft kitten, a piece of ice, a rose with thorns; (d) see-
ing a friend in a funny old hat, a blinding flash, a beautiful
view; (e) hearing a mysterious noise, a neighbor’s radio
turned too high, your favorite music.

3. Pantomimes involving emotions, as: (a) coming home
to find that your little brother has broken your airplane
model or your little sister .has torn your favorite book; (b)
taking a letter out of the mailbox and finding that it is an
invitation to go on a thrilling trip, then running off to tell
a friend; (0) driving off a big dog who has frightened a
little child, and comforting the child.

4. Transition into situations involving speech, as: (a)
various kinds of shoppers; (b) a busy lost-and-found olece;
(c) the situation in the old tale “The Stone in the Road.”

In situations having characters other than those of the
players, much care should be taken to make them as true
as possible. Ask the children to observe such people: how
they look, move, talk; what they seem to be like inside. Al-
ways stress characterization “from the inside out.”

How To Guide A Group into Creative Playmaking

In the transition to creative plays based on stories, the
leader sets the mood for the specific material to be used by:
( a) capitalizing on the feeling of the group induced hy
weather, a holiday, recent experience, and so on; or (b)
arousing curiosity by a question, picture, concrete object,
and so on. The leader must always present material with
enthusiasm. The story must reach inside before the children
can create from it.

Give the children freedom in playing. Children can al-
ways imagine plenty of ways to make up a creative play
based on a story if the leader stirs their imagination to see
more in the story than appears on the surface. It is important
to do this, not by suggestions, but by questions which will
hring forth the ideas from them.

Try to combine in each cast some of the freer and more
imaginative children with others who are shy or less ima-
ginative. Every player should have some feeling of achieve-

548

inent each time he makes a sincere effort, The stronger
players will help the weaker.

How to Guide the Group in Evaluation

Good comments should come first: What did you like?
Did they make it clear? Was it interesting? Was the charac-
terization real? Did they stay in character? Was the ac-
tion true to the story? Was there enough action? Was
the dialogue (if used) true to character? Was there team-
work? Was everyone in the scene all the time? Did the
actors react as their characters would? Did the scene move
at the right speed? Did it become more exciting as it moved
to a climax? Could we understand what the characters said?
Then ask for suggestions for improvement. It should be
said that we do not go into evaluation so thoroughly with
young children. Older children can evaluate more carefully.

IMAGINEERING—

and 7% 74W€ game! Weeding

THE RICHMOND, Virginia, Department
of Recreation and Parks believes
that its advisory board had a unique and
worthwhile annual mecting May 13 of
this year. The board, the staff of the de-
partment, and active volunteers among
the citizenry engaged in a bit of “ima-
gineering” under the excellent direction
of Charles B. McFee, J r., vice-president
and general manager of thc Virginia
Automotive Trade Association.

Mr. McFee, a prominent public rela-
tions man, explained that imagineering
was not only fun in the doing and often
funny in the hearing, but also construc-
tive in its results. To imagineer one
must forget the practical and the scien-
tific formulae which he would have to
remember if he were going to engineer.
The way- to a fresh outlook, original
ideas, and fascinating possibilities is
through first imagineering, and then en-
gineering.

With this explanation he called upon
his audience to divide themselves into
groups of ten, elect a secretary who
would record the imagineering of the
group, and a chairman who would re-
port the results of this projection by
the ten. The groups were given fifteen
minutes to pluck from their passing fan-
cies, [lights of imagination, and most
fanciful dreams what they thought
would improve the program and facili-
ties of the department of recreation and
parks. By this time a buzz had risen
from the quiet audience, and Mr. Mc-
Fee made a last suggestion over what
had already become a “buzz session”—-—-
“We’ll let the staff of the department of

This plan for a really “live” annual meeting of the advisory board is
original, has sparkle—and brings out all .sorts of future possibilities. It

brought so many compliments we thought you might like to try it. Besides,
it was fun! W e wish we’d been there!

recreation and parks worry about the
engineering of our imaginecring whcn
we’re all through!”

Among the suggestions which were
placed on the blackboard for all to see,
and later for the department to study,
was a request for more picnic areas with
cooking equipment. A tired shopper
urged that park benches be placed on
downtown street corners. A harassed
mother suggested that baby sitters be
provided on all playgrounds so that
families could participate in the fun!

Showing a more serious outlook one
of the volunteers urged an arts and
crafts division within the department
which would provide a center for more
creative recreation. Public forums in
each neighborhood of the city for the
discussion of recreation, and producing
in the summer a historical pageant of
Richmond were in the minds of others.

A public golf course and more rec-
reation for the aging were desired. An-
other outlet for recreation was viewed
as a volunteer suggested the use of the
old James River canal for power boats.

Among the new facilities desired
were a wildlife exhibit native to Vir-
ginia, indoor and neighborhood swim-
ming pools, a theatre and workshop to
seat fifteen hundred with rehearsal
space available, a skating rink, an ice
skating facility, and an amphitheatre.

It was urged that the public schools
and the department work more closely
together so that the school facilities
might be used with more ease, and

hence more frequently, for recreational
purposes. In conncction with this, niul-
ti-purpose rooms in the schools to be
used for recreation were asked to ap-
pear as a must in the blueprints for new
school buildings.

Since municipal cemeteries comc un-
der the jurisdiction of the department
of recreation and parks, they, too, re-
ceived their share of suggestions. More
lighting and personnel were suggested,
and the elimination of Sunday funerals
was desired. Standardization of head
stones, trallic-control markers, all flat
surfaces, wider roads, and putting all
lots under city perpetual care were re-
quested. To climax the cemetery sug-
gestions was a facetious near-election
remark—a special plot in our ceme1
teries to be reserved without perpetual
care for all city council members who
vote against funds for the Richmond
Department of Recreation and Parks!

Detcrmined to have an exciting a11-
nual meeting which would rebuff the ac-
cepted notions of'dull and sleep-provok-
ing annual reports, thc department
planned" the buzz session for future
thinking and planning, distributed a
pictorial revue of the departmcnt’s pro-
grams and facilities, limited introduc-
tions and speeches to fifteen minutcs,
and quickly moved indoors at the beau-
tiful Carillon, World War I memorial
in Byrd Park, for lunch when a typical
spring change in weather made the out-
door table arrangements at little too
uncomfortable.

Servicemen everywhere like sightseeing tours. As in other
countries, Japan has a host of attractions for those who just
wanl lo “look-see” as well as for shutterbugs; and the famous
ancicnt Daibutsu (great Buddha) in Tokyo, is the center of
atlention for this tour gronp sponsored by the Propeller Serv-
icc Club which conducls a weekly tour to points of intercst.

Community-Wide Celebration

Manhattan, Kansas, honored local service personnel with
a Fort Riley Day celebration. The entire day was devoted to
showing appreciation to persons in uniform and furthering
public relations between Fort Riley and the community.

All service people were admitted to the Kansas State Col-
lege-Nebraska University football game at the Ahern Me-
morial Stadium on the campus of Kansas State College for
a reduced price. Four movie houses admitted soldiers free
from one to six o’clock. Four blocks in the ccnter of town
were roped off from six to eleven o’clock for a gala street
dance featuring both social and square dancing. A profes-
sional talent show was conducted on an elevated platform
in the middle of the main busincss intersection.

Free cokes were given out all evening to uniformed per-
sonnel. Stores announced special sales of items interesting
to servicemen, and remained open until nine o’clock in-
stead of closing at five as usual. The Council of Church
Women provided a room information service.

All regular eating cstablishments catered to service per-
sonnel; and three additional eating facilities were conducted
by the Manhattan Committce on Soldier Recreation, the
First Methodist Church, and American Legion Auxiliary.

The sponsoring groups were the Chamber of Commerce,
Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Manhattan Recrea-
tion Commission.

proved to be popular additions to the service clubs’ sched-
uled events:

JUKE Box JURY

At the Cannoneers’ Corner Service Club in Darmstadt, this
program is a regular feature. Each contestant plays his
favorite record (either his own or one belonging to the club)
and gives a three-minute pep talk about it. A pre-picked
jury discusses such things as the record’s style, arrangement
and quality; and then ballots are cast to determine whether
or not the record is suitable to be nominated as a “Cannon-
eers’ Favorite.” The winning record for the evening is in-
cluded in the “Cannoneers’ Record Hall of Fame.”

MUSICAL CHARADIE SKIT

American Way Service Club in Munich tried a charade
program based wholly on music. Six men were selected as
a panel to guess names of charades, each of which was a
song title. A band “helped” by playing the wrong number
as the charade was presented on stage. “I’ll See You In My
Dreams,” “Doggie in the Window,” and “Stormy Weather”
were some of the titles acted out in fine style.

 

at a local plantation. This is one of many occasions on which
citizens ncar Sewart Air Force Base, Tcnnessee, have gra-
ciously lent homes and gardens to the servicemcn for outings
and parties under supervision of the Service Club directors.

RECREATION

 

The do-it-yourself trend has many adherents among military
personnel. Mitchell Field, Long Island, has a woodworking
shop on the base where airmen spend many of their off-duty
hours making a variety of useful articles for their homes.

PLATTER PARADE

The stage of the Carousel Service Club in Mannheim was
decorated to simulate a radio station with appropriate signs,
station call letters and control box. With this effective set-
ting as background a very successful disc jockey show was
staged with commercials, interviews, and, of course, music.
It was request time for the men.

PROGRAMS FOR LISTENING

Vogelweh Service Club in Kaiserslautern, as part of music
“listening” activities, distributed typed programs and had
a narration for both classical and modern jazz recorded
sessions. A musical movie program called “Magic Melo-
dies,” consisting of films such as Music in America, Music
in Canada, and movies of instrumental soloists and ensem-
bles was used for another program. A jazz trio was hired as a
“starter” for a Sunday jam session which grew into a regu-
lar weekly feature as musicians recruited their friends and
club advertising and word-of-mouth publicity carried news
of the activity to the men.

Lounge Crafts Activities*
STONE ETCHING

When man first took pen in hand—so to speak—he picked
up a chisel and carved his symbols in stone.

Today, a stone carver or etcher picks up a paint brush
and a bottle of acid and produces in the wink of an eye an
engraved stone that might have taken his caveman forebears
many hours of laborious handwork to complete.

Because stone etching is a quick and easy projcct requir-
ing few working materials, it’s an excellent craft for a lounge
demonstration and group activity. And, according to crafts
director Dorothy Cavalier, Southern Area Command, soldier
craftsmen find the project intriguing.

Miss Cavalier has been conducting lounge demonstrations
in stone etching throughout Munich Sub-Area. For her
demonstrations, she uses flat stone plaques (about tile-size)
of a sandstone and limestone combination:

The areas in the pattern which are to be protected against
the corroding action of the acid arc painted with any en-
amel paint, lacquer, or airplane dope. The latter is used for
demonstration purposes because it is quick drying.

The acid eats away these unprotectcd areas leaving a
raised design. If the design pattern itself is to be raised, that
area is painted. If it is to be grooved into the tile, then the
background areas are coated with paint or lacquer.

Once the coating has dried, the stone is dipped into an
acid solution. For her demonstrations, Miss Cavalier uses
one part hydrochloric acid to five parts water. The acid
action works rapidly, in minutes, and the stone may be re-
moved when the desired depth of the etching is reached.
When the stone has dried again, a coat of shellac is applied
to give it a protective covering and smooth finish.

The completed tile is in itself a finishcd product, making
an attractive gift for the folks at home particularly when
decorated with a design symbolic of the local area. It may
be used as a wall plaque and it makes an ideal hot plate
holder for the dinner table.

A series of the etched stone plaqucs will make a decora-
tive border for an indoor or outdoor garden plot, though
for outdoor use the stoncs are subject to weather-wear.

Like ceramic tiles, the stone plaqucs may be inlaid to make
a colorful pattern in a serving tray, on a coffee tray end
table or other pieces of household furniture.

PLASTER CARVING

Carving in plastcr is a lounge project that provides an
excellent introduction to the art of sculpturing. The crafts-
man needs few tools—any kind of knife will do, and sand-
papcr produces a good finish.

Making the plaster block to work from requir_es a mixing
pan, dry plaster and water. A mixture of about one part
water and two parts plaster is a good proportion. If the
plaster sets slowly, adding some salt will hurry it up; if it
sets too fast, a little vinegar will slow down the action.

The plaster is siftcd into the water, allowed to sit for five
minues or so and then stirred slowly until it begins to hard-
en. When it starts hardening, it must be poured immediately
into the mold. If coloring is to be added, it has to be mixed
in quickly just before the plaster is poured into the mold.

For molds, any heavy paper throwaway container—milk
carton, paper plate, paper cup, show box—is usable. (Have
a fistful of clay handy to plug up any leaks in the paper con- -
tainer.) The hardening proccss is quick, about a quartcr
of an hour. Once the plaster has solidified, the paper mold
is stripped off and the plaster is ready for carving.

For a relief carving in a plaque, a paper plate is used for
the mold, and a wire hanger is inserted in the plaster as
soon as it is pourcd.

If no coloring is added to the plaster before it is molded,
the finished carving may be painted with water colors or
oils or may be varnished, shellacked or waxed.

TION, January 1954. tells about another good craft activity

National Advisory Committee on Recruitment, Training and Placement of

Recreation Personnel

The third annual meeting of the N a-
tional Advisory Committee on Recruit-
ment, Training and Placement of Rec-
reation Personnel took place during the
recent National Recreation Congress.
Just short of three years old, this com-
mittee has much to show for its brief
existence. Composed of eighty mem-
bers from thirty-three states and the
District of Columbia, represcnting all
the NRA’S field districts, it has outlined,
planned, and launched a broad person-
nel program which is doing much to
dignify the recreation profession and
to improve recreation services.

Thirty-seven assignments have been
made by the five subchairmcn on Re-
cruitment, Undergraduate Education,
Graduate Education, Inservice Train~
ing and Placement. Ten additional as-
signments have been made by the com-
mittee in general. The accomplishments,
to date, of a committee that has been
able to meet only twice previously and
whose members are scattered from
coast to coast, are nothing short of
amazing. The work has been carried
on almost entirely by correspondence.

Among its accomplishments are some
valuable publications and studies: the
twenty-nine-page manual on inservice
training for parks and recreation;
twenty thousand c0pies of an attractive
pamphlet, How To Choose the Right
College [or Your Career in Recreation;
a national salary study conducth and
the report published in RECREATION
with reprints distributed widely; two
studies of student aid— scholarships,
fellowships and assistantships—con-
ducted and published with wide distri-
bution; a fifty-page publication, Play-

 

MR. SUTHERLAND, head of the National
Recreation Association Personnel Serv-
ice, has acted as secretary to this na-
tional advisory committee during its
three years of operation.

NOVEMBER 1954

ground Leaders—Their Selection and
Training; a thirty-page booklet on
training community center personnel,
now ready to go to press; lists of col-
leges and universities conducting major
recreation curricula have been brought
up-to-date and made available for wide
distribution; a study of student field
experience of which published reports
are now available; twenty-one articles
by members of the committee have ap-
peared in RECREATION magazine.

The committee participated in and
prepared material for a chapter on rec-
reation at the Fourth National Confer-
ence On Health in Colleges. The per-
sonnel sessions at the national congress
and district conferences were developed
from the committee’s SUggestions. Its
members have carried important re-
sponsibility for these and have partici-
pated in special training meetings and
the Second Student Confercnce on In-
ter-American Culture and Education.
Twenty thousand copies of Recreation
-—A New Profession in a Changing
World were distributed by the commit-
tee as an aid to recruiting for the rec-
reation profession, and complimentary
cepies of the Howard Braucher memor-
ial publication were sent to three hun-
dred and fifty recreation students.

Publications and reports for which
material is now being assembled in-
clude: a national‘survey of colleges and
universities conducting major recrea-
tion curricula; campus recreation
study; the essentials of a good recrea-
tion department; a statement on per-
sonnel policies and practices; and sev-
eral miscellaneous recruitment articles.

The committee has many other pro-
jects pending and suggested. Among
these are: fund raising for a national
personnel survey; a standard salary
study plan; a statement on certification,
licensing, and accreditation; revision
of Personnel Standards in Recreation

W. C. Sutherland

Leadership; a‘jtudy of the qualities of
a good recrea ion executive; how to
select a recreation executive; special
materials for a continuous intcrpreta-
tion of personnel standards for city
managers, mayors, and other public of-
ficials; a plan for an acceptance of
standardized nomenclature and job ti-
tles; encouragement of recreation agen-
cies to provide more Opportunities for
major recreation students in summer
and part-time positions; the dcvc10p-
ment of a continuing working relation-
ship between executives and recreation
educators; promotion of scholarships,
fellowships, and internships; and cri-
teria for evaluation of job performance.

The various subcommittees on per-
sonnel are continuing to study the ma-
jor problems in their respective areas
and the approaches to their solution.
The present committee is to be congrat-
ulated on its accomplishments in the
short period of its existence. It has
identified inhibitions, studied and an-
alyzed important problems, prepared
excellent publications and materials for
immediate use, accepted urgent assign-
ments, and has made SUggestions for a
continuing program. It is strongly rec-
ommended that this large and effective
committee made up of recreation edu-
cators, general educators, and park and
recreation executives be given encour-
agement and increasing support by the
National Recreation Association and
the recreation profession.

The collective wisdom, force, and ac-
tion evidenced in the foregoing list ‘of
activities testifies to the readiness and
willingness of the committee members
to give unselfisth of themselves to im-
prove the profession and to advance
the recreation movement in America
and throughout the world. It has been
my genuine pleasure to work with and
to be associated with such a conscien-
tious and dedicated group.

ties. Meanwhile, the commission has
been busily developing facilities at Ville
Platte City Park and the new Como
Park in Abbeville. The latter, a forty-
acre tract willed to the commission by
Dr. A. J. Como, is being financed by a
$60,000 bond issue plus fifty per cent of
the receipts from all parking meters.
When the cost of the meters is paid the
park will receive the total revenue.

9 “Adult Education for a Free So-
ciety” is the theme for the forthcoming
conference of the Adult Education As-
sociation of the U.S.A., to be held at the
Hotel Morrison, Chicago, November 5
to 10. Historian Henry Steele Com-
mager, will keynote the conference.

O In a recent full-page advertisement
in a New York City newspaper, an air-
craft company tried to attract workers
to its new plant in Connecticut by stress-
ing the increased Opportunities for rec-
reation and education such a move
would bring. A portion of the ad carried
a map of Connecticut and surrounding
regions pin-pointing the various recrea-
tion attractions and points of historic
intcrest. Accompanying the map was
the following statement:

There is more to living than working. We
are looking for engineers who care enough
about their future and family to want per-
manently the good living of New England, the
educational advantages for their children of
the fine schools and Colleges in the area, the
recreational facilities of shore and menutaiu
near at hand, the cultural benefits of the city
in.-close touch with the quiet beauty of the
countryside, and the opportunity to become a
part of the community through service.

O In Ohio this summer some one
thousand crippled children attended
camps scattered over the state. County
societies, Rotary Clubs, the Ohio So-
ciety for Crippled Children, Inc., and
other groups were responsible for the
camping program which included day
camps and one-week, two-week and
longer periods in camps which ranged
from the very rustic to the highly cos-
mopolitan.

O Special one-day recreation confer-
ences for municipal ofhcials, recreation
board membcrs, school and civic
leaders were hcld recently in Alabama,
sponsored by the Alabama Recreation
Society, the Alabama League of Muni-
cipalities, and the National Recreation
Association. The program was de-
signed not for professional recreation
workers or leaders but for municipal
officials and laymen whose civic and
community duties and activities bring
them into the over-all recreation pic-
ture. The programs included a review
of legislation, financing, trained per-
sonnel, program content, and public
relations to better promote interest in
recreation activities.

O In observance of National Joseph
Lee Week the San Francisco Recreation
and Park Commission sponsored a per-
formance of Lucia di Lammermoor as
part of its midsummer music festival at
the Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove.

RECREATION

9 Under the leadership of Robert
Smith, coordinator of music for the
Parks and Recreation Department of
the City and County of Denver, the city
is having an exciting expansion of
participation in music. Seven local
choruses, a symphonic band and a
string orchestra give individual per-
formances as well as frequent radio and
television appearances.

Music Week observance has taken on
new vitality with the addition of muni-
cipal music to the outstanding public
school program. Directors and accom-
panists are engaged on a part-time
basis. Enthusiastic cooperation of the
music department of the public schools
provides rooms and library service. The

budget for 1954 is $15,600.

9 The following statement was quoted
in the September 1954 issue of the Na-
tional Municipal Review from Part V.
“Reduction of Urban Vulnerability,” of
the Report of Project East River, pub-
lished under Signal Corps contract by
Associated Universities,NewYork City,
l952. It appears in a section entitled
“Standards for States, Cities”:

Parks and Other Open Space: Lack of large
parks is common in most of the rapidly de-
veloping suburban areas today. Private golf
courses, once a substantial source of Open
land, are being absorbed for large-scale hous-
ing developments. Civil defense requirements
indicate the need of a vigorous revival of park
acquisition programs by states and counties.
Since the metropolitan areas are expanding
rapidly into their surrounding countryside, a
program of federal aid to states, counties, and
cities is essential for such areas. The problem
of maintaining Open space between urban com-
munities is one of the most diiiicult to solve.
Opportunities once missed. as a- practical mat-
ter are alm0st permanently lost.

0 One of the most attractive and use-
ful bits of publicity material to come to
our attention is the “Recreation Calen-
dar” put out by the recreation depart-
ment in Hanford, California. The neat-
ly illustrated calendar in the standard
square-per-day form contains very ade-
quate information about the special rec-
reation activities; and on the page for
each month there is the department’s
slogan, “Leisure Can Lift—~all who use
its opportunities,” and a short original
rhynte about leisure.

Q The annual report for 1952 from
Baltimore, Maryland, tells of a success-
ful cooperative nature and gardening
program: The department of education
and the bureau of recreation have joint-
ly conducted a garden and nature pro-
gram for eighty children of the lower
grades of Graceland Park Elementary
School. One third-grade and one fourth-
grade class were selected to participate
in the program for one period a week.

The response of both children and
teachers in charge was enthusiastic and

NOVEMBER 1954

considerable interest was stimulated in
living and growing things. The instruc-
tion was varied from time to time
through trips, pictures, and guest speak-
ers. The bureau of recreation hoped
that this successful experiment would
result in a training course for teachers
which would enlarge this type of pro-
gram and increase the knowledge of
gardening, create a reSpect for proper-
ty, and develop appreciation of nature.

0 The Willamalane Park and Recrea-
tion District, Springfield, Oregon, pro-
duced a thirty-minute movie, A Sum-
mer of Fun, photographed by Bert Dot-
son, summer handcraft specialist, in his
spare time. The movie, depicting the
many summer activities for people of
all ages, is in color and magnetically
sound stripped, with hackground music
and narration. It is shown to service
clubs, church groups, and so on, and is
an excellent public relations promotion
piece.

ties for classroom use. C0pies are avail-
able on request.

0 According to State Park Statistics——
1953, compiled from annual records on
state parks and related recreation areas
by the Cooperative Activities Division
of the National Park Service:

The rate of increase in attendance for 1953
was slightly higher for overnight use than for
day use, with the major gain occurring in tent.
and trailer camping . . . Of the total of over-
night visitors in 1953, sixty-two per cent
stayed in tent or trailer camps . . . Within
the last five years, the use of tent and trailer
camps has more than doubled and the use of
organized camps has increased by one-third,
while use' of cabins has shown little change
and use of hotels and lodges has declined.

O A recent conference sponsored by
the Michigan litter-Agency Council for
Recreation was aimed at increasing the
recreation participation of Michigan’s
thousands of industrial employees and
their families. Directors of industrial
recreation departments convened with
representatives of state government
units administering recreation facili-
ties. Reports of the conference are avail-
able upon request from the council

9 Weekly roller-skating sessions
started at five Los Angeles municipal
playgrounds won immediate popularity.
Ralph Borrelli, director of special
events for the recreation and parks de-
partment, says that the afternoon ses-
sions, which are Open to youngsters of
sixteen and under, and the evening ses-
sions for older skaters have attracted
large throngs. The Sport’s devotees
glide over the hardwood floors of the
playgrounds’ community clubhouses to
the strains of recorded organ music.
Rental fees for the fiber-wheeled skates
are twenty cents for the afternoon ses-
sions and thirty-live cents for the eve-
ning ones.

The Book of Games for
Boys and Girls

Evelyne Borst. A. S. Barnes 8: Co.
232 Madison Avenue, New York 16.
Pp. 277. $3.50.

In this reviewer’s Opinion, this book
is something more than the average
book on games and how to teach and
play them. It is, in addition, a stimu-
lating account of creative activity cast
in the mold of informal relaxing play
designed to give development’to the
total individual.

Miss Borst has predicated her infor-
mation upon the well-founded assump-
tion that games which have heen passed
down to us are a sort of residue of early
man’s cultural hahits and experiences
not only as these related to his physical
life, hut to his imaginative powers as
well.

The game leader or teacher, there-
fore, who is desirous of providing 0p-
portunity for both mental and physical
development will eSpecially welcome
sections of this book, for he will dis-
cover that the author, like many of our
foremost educators, places emphasis
upon the pleasurable nature of learning
with games as the avenue through
which pleasurable learning can travel.

One entire section of the book uses
creative and imaginative games to
teach factual information; and material
is based upon factual study of history,
geography and literature.

As an example in point, let us glance
at the section of games for Lincoln’s
Birthday. ln her introduction, Miss
Borst makes clear her contention of
games as informational material.

“The games for Lincoln’s Birthday
give children the opportunity to cor-
relate fact with fun. Games for this pa-
triotic day are based upon events from
the hoyhood and manhood of Lincoln.
History hecomes alive as the boys and
girls partake in the celebration.”

Then follow singing. marching. cir-
cle games with each circle representing
one of Lincoln’s childhood homes; a
pantomimic game using Lincoln’s vo-
cations as subject matter; a yarn-spin-

ning game in round-robin storytelling
form; and many of the more familiar
competitive relay-type games. Likewisc
games for Christmas, Thanksgiving.
St. Patrick’s Day, Washington’s Birth-
day— in fact, all our important days
—are developed in an interesting and
fun-giving way.

For the more traditionally-minded
game leader there is also ample mate-
rial on “Indoor Games, With and With-
out Equipment;” “Games for Play-
ground and Gymnasiumg” “Picnic
Planning;” and a chapter on “The
Leadership of Games.”

I suggest that for the creative direc-
tor, teacher or recreation worker, The
Book of Games for Boys and Girls is an
indispensible addition to the library
shelf .—Crace Walker, Creative Recrea-
tion Leadership Training Specialist,

Basketball for Girls and \Vomen

Helen B. Lawrence and Grace I. Fox.
McGraw-Hill Book Company. Inc., 330
West 42nd Street, New York 36. Pp.
254. $4.00.

This very well-written book with ma-
terial well organized for easy reference.
is filled with practical suggestions and
the answers to many prohlems confront-
ing teachers and recreation leaders re-
sponsihle for the coaching and manage-
ment of girls’ and women’s basketball
teams.

The material has heen divided into
three sections:

The first deals with management and
includes down-to-earth discussions on
Sportsmanship competition, condition-
ing, prevention and care of injuries and
officiating.

The second deals with an analysis of
individual and team techniques. These
are clearly explained, and include catch-
ing and passing, goal shooting, offen-
sive and defensive team play, giving the
how and why of each.

The third covers the history and de-
vel0pment of basketball for girls and
women going back to 1893. This section
also includes Basketball Standards of

the tVatlonat Section for Girls’ and
Women’s Sports, Standards Governing
Interscholastic Athletics for Girls as
carried on by the National Federation
of State High School Athletic Associa-
tions, and the Rules for Competition of
the Amateur Athletic Union.

This hook has been very much
needed. lf the reader would follow the
suggestions of these two authors and
their findings, which are the result of
many years of outstanding experience
in teaching and coaching, our basket-
ball programs would be hettcr and there
could be little criticism of competitive
play. It is highly recommended—Hel-
en M. Dauncey, Katherine F. Barker

Girls, National Recreation Association.

Guide to Community Action

Mark S. Matthews. Harper & Broth-
ers, 49 East 33rd Street, New York 16.
Pp. 434. $4.00.

In preparing the Guide to Communi-
ty Action, Mr. Matthews has rendercd
a valuable service to individuals and
organizations interested in scrving
their communities. It is especially use-
ful and significant at a time when civic
and social service are increasingly rec-
ognized as rewarding leisure-timc ac-
tivities and when citizen participation
in the solution of local problems be-
comes more and more essential to the
maintenance of the American way of
life.

This publication contains an amazing
fund of information as to sources to
which individuals and local groups can
turn for information and advice with
respect to fifteen areas of community
service. Of special interest to recrea-
tion workers are the chapters dealing
with “Community Arts” and “Sports
and Recreation,” which contain sugges-
tions for a wide variety of recreation
activities. Few if any recreation depart-
ments will he familiar with all of the
sources of literature, films, and other
program aids listed in the volume.

Recreation workers, as well as other
municipal officials and individuals, in-
terested in the work of a wide variety
of community organizations will find
many practical ideas for initiating pro-
jects, organizing committees, conduct-
ing meetings and raising funds for com-
munity projects in this valuable refer-
ence book. lt tells them what they can
do, how to do, and where to turn for
help in doing it.

The Recreation Program

The Athletic Institute, 209 South
State Street, Chicago, Illinois. Pp. 342.
$3.00.

This book, the result of the Second-
National WorkshOp on Recreation, held

559

in the Kellogg Center for Continuing
Education, Michigan State College, is
the product of a year’s planning, two
special conferences, and ten days’ inten-
sive work on the part of carefully select-
ed recreation executives, educators, and
leaders from a wide variety of agencies
and organizations.

Because it is a group product, the
result of intensive night-and-day work
on the part of many people, it is uneven
in style,' and sometimes in content; but
it has a vitality often lacking in books
prepared carefully by one author. It
gives a vivid picture of the state of rec-
reation programs. It is alive.

Many of us can argue over some of
the classifications, deplore some of the
omissions, but the very problems that
confront every recreation department
and leader confronted the special com-
mittees working on the various chap-
ters. Programs just won’t stay put!
They blend, meld, run over into each
other. The very fact that there is this
overlapping is an indication that a rich,
varied recreation program is not the re-
sult of a series of individual activities,
but a colorful mosaic in which each
small part blends into others, producing
as a final picture a total program.

Every recreation department should
have this book. Every leader should
read it. Every department should use
it as a base on which to build a com-
munity program and on which to add
those local factors that an over-all pro-
gram cannot encompass. It is our book,
producedsby our profession, based on
our experiences. Its weaknesses are
ours. We must make use of it.

Individualism Reconsidered

David Reisman. The Free Press,

Clencoe, Illinois. Pp. 529. $6.00.

The author of The Lonely Crowd

has presented a collection of thirty es-
says on a wide variety of subjects rang-
ing from observations on the thought
of Freud to football as a factor in cul-
ture diffusion.

The reader who prefers a light liter-
ary diet would do well to avoid this
book because the author makes no pre-
tense of pitching his discourse at the
level of the least intellectual. His essays
are written chiefly for teachers, liberals,
social scientists, and intellectuals, and
deal primarily with the subject of val-
ucs in the area of which, he believes,
people should be free to make choices
else they fail to achieve individuality.

Several of these essays will not add
materially to the general popularity of
the author because of the acrid and sa-
tirical comments relating to a number
of large and influential groups in Amer-
ica. For example, he offends Catholics

560

by attacking the confession as being
“more immoral than the original act
which is confessed, because it means
that the person is unwilling to bear the
responsibility for his actions” but at-
tempts “to shift his sense of guilt to an-
other.”

He is “not attracted by the picture of
a crusade to implant self-consciousness
about values in all the pious and plati-
tudinous teachers of America. I would
rather have them teach languages and
algebra, and biochemistry.” He also
shelters doubts about leaders who in at-
tempting to create a profession are in
part doing so in order to “impress cli-
ents” and themselves, and to “regular-
ize a colleague grouping” and “create a
setting in which one is understood.”
This last statement reminds the review-
er of a comment by one of America’s
best known essayists, E. B. White, with
respect to another critic. White said
that this critic apparently had been
spared “the irksome experience of be-
coming acquainted with the material
he is criticizing.”

The function of an essayist, I assume,
is to reflect on life as he sees it and not
to popularize himself. There is much
in this book that is excellent. Among
the essays of greatest significance to the
recreationist are “Some Observations
on Changes in Leisure Attitudes,” “Rec-
reation and the Recreationist,” “The
Themes of Work and Play in the Struc-
ture of Freud’s Thought,” and “How
Different May One Be?”

Especially valu'able are the following
points of view:

1. The desire for group acceptance
may put such a high premium on con-
forlnity as to result in a tragic failure
to develop one’s unique potentialities.

2. There is no real distinction be-
tween active and passive recreation."

3. Some people’s leisure needs may
have to be satisfied before they can rise
above the level of needs—from the level
of recreation to the level of creation.

4. We should provide funds “for

those who want to do the rare and in-
frequent thing.”

5. The child’s greatest satisfaction
in play appears to arise from experi-
ences of mastery and control.

6. Care should be taken lest family
recreation become bores01ne for all-—
a watered-down version of recreation
in which all sharpness and vitality have
been sacrificed.

If you don’t object to a high degree
of irritation mixed with an equally high
degrec-of stimulation you should read
many, if not all, of these essays:—

cal Education, Florida State University,

The Municipal Year Book, 1954

Clarence E. Ridley, Orin F. Nolting.
and David S. Arnold. The International
City Managers’ Association, 1313 East
Sixtieth Street, Chicago. Pp. 613.
$10.00

Significant new features appear in the
1954 edition of The Municipal Year
Book, an authoritative resume of activi-
ties and statistical data of American
cities, which again provides municipal
officials with information on the current
problems of cities throughout the coun-
try, with statistics on individual city ac-
tivities and with analyses of trends by
population groups. One of them, “Ur-
ban County,” presents detailed data for
174 counties of more than 100,000 pop-
ulation located in metropolitan areas.
The section on “Metropolitan and Ur-
banized Areas” shows, for the first time,
the number and types of local govern-
ment units within each standard metro-
politan area. These sections, together
with the new material on controls and
services provided in unincorporated
fringe areas, are especially significant in
view of the increasingly complex prob-
lems in metropolitan areas.

Of special interest to recreation and
park authorities is the section relating
to park and recreation developments
in 1953 and the table giving salaries or
municipal oflicials in cities of various
populations.

The year book is an indispensable
reference source for all who are con-
cerned with municipal government.

The prayer lingers still . . . across the

Saving for security is easy—on the Payroll
Savings Plan for investing in United States
Savings Bonds.

This is all you do. Go to your company’s
pay ofiice, choose the amount you want to
save——a few dollars a payday, or as much
as you wish. That money will be set aside
for you before you even draw your pay.
And automatically invested in United
States Series “E” Savings Bonds which are
turned over to you.

The most precious gift we give or
receive is the gift of security. Only in
a land like ours are we free to choose
security as a goal of living.

And through this choice we achieve
another great gift. For, secure homes,
one joining another, make up the
security of America.

 

If you can save only $3.75 a week on the
Plan, in 9 years and 8 months you will have
$2,137.30.

U.S. Series “E” Savings Bonds earn in-
terest at an average of 3% per year, com-
pounded semiannually, when held to matu-
rity! They can go on earning interest for as
long as 19 years and 8 months if you wish.

If you want interest as current income ask

your bank about 3% Series “H” Bonds which
pay interest semiannually by Treasury check.
