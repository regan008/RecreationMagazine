All children are alike in their need to play—and
to play is to learn and to grow. As Joseph Lee
pointed out in Play and Education, “It is the su-
preme seriousness of play that gives it its educa-
tional importance.” See “The Importance of Play,”
pages 432-433. Photo is of young Mal Campbell of
Annapolis, Maryland, through courtesy of the pho-

tographer, Fred J. Wheelehan, assistant director of
Annapolis Recreation Department.

Next Month -

We strive to make our Christmas issue especially
exciting. This year, it will carry the story of the
Second International Congress with many pictures
of this big Philadelphia meeting; Christmas arti-
cles, such as “A Giant Christmas Wreath,” “Last
Minute Program Shopping.” Among other mate-

rials will be an excellent article by Robert Moses, ,

head of the New York City and State Park Systems,
written especially for the Philadelphia Congress on
“Future Suburban Parks.” Tenley Albright, 1956
Olympic women’s figure skating champion, gives
readers pointers in “You Can Skate Too.”

°  7H0 HAS not stood under the canopy of the heavens on a clear, crisp,
. autumn evening and marveled at the beauty of the stars? Man has

-  wondered about, been interested in, and influenced by these and other celes-

tial bodies throughout his sojourn on earth. In his develOpment from prim-

% a itive to more sophisticated cultures, wherever dispersed around the world,
‘ ' man has left evidences of this influence upon his life and thinking'. The
’ ° . ' stars have guided his footsteps on land, aided in navigating his ships at

g . sea and provided warmth and light by day and night. In all places and
R times man has regarded them as sources of great power, even going to the

g extent of deifying them at one time or another.
Evidence of this influence is seen all about us today because man has
. made the star a symbol of highest achievement, an emblem of goodness

' and the t0p award of merit. The child gets a star for attaining certain skills;
a star indicates the rank of highest achievement in the army; the outstanding
athlete is a star; likewise the leading actor gets a star on his door.

As the Christmas season approaches and the various decorative motifs

. _ symbolic of the occasion are displayed on every hand, one symbol stands

‘% '. ' out. It, too, is a star, and symbolizes a particular one which was seen nearly

. two thousand years ago by shepherds in the fields. This star also guided

<k the Wise Men to the birthplace of a Child whose life became the greatest
example of creative living the world has ever known.

- In the intervening years since the Star of Bethlehem marked the birth-

place of the Christ cliild there is little doubt that other stars have not also
appeared over other children. These stars have taken the form of hope in
the minds and hearts of parents that their children would emulate the Per-
fect One and live creatively within the limits of their individual capacities.

During this happy season of the year when hearts are filled with thanks-
giving and thoughts are focussed upon expressions of love for others, it
is easier to realize the need for seeing a star over each and every child whom
we may be privileged to have a part in guiding. We should be aware of
the fact that each child is endowed in some degree with the basic powers
needed to live creatively. We should further realize that it is our responsi-
bility, as teachers and parents [and leaders], to do our best to guide the
development of these basic creative powers to full and complete fruition
within each child. Unless we encourage the develOpment of those powers
which undergird the creative process, how can we eXpect the child to live
creatively, not only as a child but as an adult as well? There is something
within each child that will merit a star of one magnitude or another. Let us

strive to discover that something and guide him to behold his star. I

Dog-Eared Issue

Sirs:

The June issue of RECREATION, some—
what dog-cared, is still on my desk. The
gold on the cover is, however, as un-
dimmed as the spirit of service in evi-
dence during the Association’s fifty
years of existence.

To an old-timer like myself, those
portions which deal with the past bring
back pleasant memories of pioneer ef-
forts. I know I am prejudiced, but a
great many of yesteryear’s activities are
still usable today with slight modifica-
tions. The picture of “Teddy” Roose-

velt on page 261 brought back some
fond recollections. He was my boyhood
hero, and my Scout troop served as his
honor guard when he visited my home
town, Bennington, Vermont.

RECREATION provides considerable
source material for those of us who like
to make speeches. Using material from
one person may be called plagiarism,
but when one selects his material from
several articles, it becomes research.
The Golden Anniv‘érsary Issue is a good '
hunting ground for “researchers.”

RECREATION is always a source of
“know how” information and inspira-
tion. In addition to this continuing
service, the anniversary number re-
cords the marvelous amount of progress
made by the recreation movement. '

There are many other fine features
which I would like to praise, but I am
going to conclude with a tribute to the
advertisers. Their material is Well ar-
ranged, interesting tp read and helpful
to recreation workers, besides helping
to foot the bill for a line magazine.
Could One ask for more?

About Teen-Agers

and read the April, 1956 (playground),-l
edition of RECREATION. I ‘

We always enjoy the magazine, but“
this month it was particularly interest-j
ing because of the several good articles,
about teen-agers. Both “The Teen-Agar;
———What Factors Attract Him to the.
Playground?” and “Teen-Agers in;
‘Good Standing’ ” were excellent arti-'
cles and we certainly enjoyed reading‘
them. I ,’

Nature in Camping

Sirs:

We have read and reread, “Nature
Activities in Camping” which appears
in the June issue of RECREATION. We
think it is outstanding.

We are left with the feeling that per-
haps the title of the article is, however,
too restrictive. To us, it seems that the
message conveyed needs to be put
across to adults also.

We have in the past two years ex-
panded our naturalist program so that
we now provide full time naturalist
service at three of our major state
parks. This program is operated ointly
with the University of Minnesota’s Mu-
seum of Natural History. The apprecia-
tion of this service by the general pub-
lic is attested to by a large volume of
complimentary mail. We are, accord-
ingly, hopeful that the program might
be expanded greatly in the biennia to
come. We believe that it is through pro-
grams of this sort that the basic thought
that you express can be" put across to
a receptive adult population.

We are taking the liberty of mimeo-
graphing your article and distributing
it to our state park superintendents.

State Parks, St. Paul, Minnesota.

A TIME FOR THANKFULNESS

November is a month for giving
thanks, for counting blessings. It is
also a time for giving.

High on every good citizen’s list of
beneficiaries are the health, recreation
and family welfare agencies included
in United Fund or Community Chest
campaigns. The services they provide
are everybody’s blessings.

Youth agencies helping boys and
girls grow up to be responsible men
and women, leisure time activities for
both old and young, protective care for
babies, health programs providing life-
saving research and care for the ill and
handicapped . . . these are the things
for which every community-minded cit-
izen gives generously according to abil-
ity. The service and ability to give are
things for which we all give thanks.

Now is the time to make sure your
town can provide its people with the
blessings of adequate health and Wel-
fare services. This is the time to give
thanks for the gift and the giverf Have
you given your share?

Roller Skating is the one sport in
which all your students can partic--
ipate. It handles large groups of
boys and girls quickly and easily,
and does not require a change of
clothes. The equipment is rela-
tively inexpensive. Little supervi-
sion is needed. That’s why more
and more schools are making roller
skating a definite part of their
physical education and recreation
programs.

Public Parks 011 Private Property

An. industrial recreation administrator reveals* a yield of recreation
enjoyment on industrial forest lands. This 13 an example of the. sort
of thing large industries are now domg as they become Increasmgly

Frederick Billings

‘ttE BARRIER supposedly separating private business in-
rl terests and those of state and federal agencies exists,
in many cases, only in the imagination. The mutual desire
to work together shows us that it is pretty thin and easily
broken through.

We are both serving the public. In your business, you
are furnishing Mr. and Mrs. America and family with a
vast variety of outdoor facilities, and for your purposes
you can view this public as an entity. In modern jargon,
you are “selling” your program to one public.

With industry, on the other hand, there are different kinds
of publics: customers, employees, shareholders. The most
important of these publics is the customer public. As in
any business, my company’s first concern must be to sell
its products. The use of my company’s land for timber
production, which involves watershed and soil protection
as well, must come first, then, with recreation use of this
land following up in a strong second place.

The underlying reasons for putting out the welcome mat
for the American public, as we do, are:

I. With most state and federal park facilities crowded,
people are going to Use our lands for outdoor activities.

2. If we educate people properly, eventually they will
control each other in the correct use of recreation facilities.

3. We want the public’s good will.

4. Because of overcrowded game conditions, we welcome
the public’s help in hunting those game animals, in season,
which damage our small trees.

The operating policy of Weyerhaeuser Timber Company
outlines the principles which guide our day-to-day produc-
tion operations. It reads as follows:

The operating policy of the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company
is to operate its properties so as to provide continuous and
profitable employment for its workmen, a profitable investment
for its shareholders. and uninterrupted supplies of forest prod-
ucts for the consuming public at reasonable prices.

As you can see, our basic reasoning, planning and opera-
tion are all predicated on the idea of a sustained, perma-
nent harvest of trees from our Washington and Oregon tree
farms. The volume of tree crops l logs) harvested each year

is commensurate with the annual growth of the forests en-
trusted to our management.

A tree farm is a privately-owned, taxpaying area of forest
land, voluntarily dedicated to growing of timber as a per.
petual crop. All tree farm owners- agree. to protect their

In addition to fishing, company-maintained parks provide.

The actual beginning of the tree-farm movement was

RECREATIOL

 

   
 
   
   

tree farm at Clemons was a simple picnic spot with none of
the facilities we regard as a standard minimum today; but
it was a “first” for us and it marked the beginning of a pub-
lic park program that is destined for greater growth and
development.

Hunting and fishing privileges had .been granted to local
sportsmen in our forest areas before this time, but the idea
of maintaining a scenic recreation area and providing basic
park facilities came only shortly before World War II.

The number of our parks has steadily increased since that
time until now—some fifteen years later—we have fourteen
parks in Washington and Oregon. 0f the 89,000 people
who used our tree farms for recreation pursuits in 1955, we
estimate that 40,000 were park visitors.

To formalize and strengthen our recreation program, my
company has adopted a recreation policy. The statement
reflects the thinking and views of the managers at our branch
locations who are responsible for timberland management

and production operations.

 

1. Local families enjoy a picnic supper in the first tree farm to
1 be opened for public use, the Harry E. Morgan Park. Com-
. pany has five parks in the Toutle River area in Washington.

As you read this recreation policy, please bear in mind
that its spirit is one of~ good neighborlinessu—an invitation
‘ to the public to come in and visit our forest lands, much as
you would invite a guest into your own home.

Recreation Policy

Although the primary use of the forest land is for the produc-
tion of timber, it is company policy to make the land available
for secondary uses which are not detrimental to the maximum
growth of new tree crops.

Recreation opportunities shall be offered to the public through
the use of designated tree farm areas for campers, hunters, fish-
erman, and other recreationists. The use of these areas shall
be limited only as necessary to avoid fire, injury to employees
or the public, or damage to the timber crops, roads or equipment.

Whenever possible, sites of historic interest or outstanding
scenic beauty shall be preserved for public enjoyment. '

The company shall cooperate with groups interested in pro-
- moting recreation use of forest land in developing programs for
the proper use of the designated areas.

Extending to the public the privilege of use of company lands
for recreation purposes will help to achieve a better understand-
ing and appreciation of the benefits to be derived from sound
forestry management of privately owned timber lands.

This, then, is our feeling toward the visiting public—-——the

OVEMBER 1956

campers, hunters, fisherman, hikers, berry pickers, nature or
flower photographers, skiers, birdwatchers, sightseers, tar-
get shooters, rock collectors, horseback riders or archers.

The fourteen parks which we maintain for tourists pro
vide picnic tables, piped water, restrooms, stone and cement
fireplaces, free firewood, as well as receptacles for trash.
Swimming and fishing are available at twelve of the parks
and overnight camping is permitted at all of them. Parking
facilities are also provided and, like you no doubt, we are
learning what a tremendous difference there is between
parking space and adequate parking space.

For me to tell you that parks are crowded these days is
unnecessary. We all know the staggering figures on the in-
creasing number of pe0ple and dollars that will be wrapped
up in regional and national recreation pursuits in the com-
ing years. ,

In Washington State alone, the modest 800,000 visitors
of 1946 seem trivial when contrasted to the more than 5,-
500,000 visitors this year. The economic contributions of
the overnight campers alone, who last year numbered 400,-
000 and spent $25,000,000, benefit both rural and urban
areas in my state through sales and gasoline taxes and, in-
directly,_,by real and property taxes paid by retailers.

Dr. Weldon Gibson of the Standard Research Institute
recently commented, “In twenty-six states, the tourist trade
is the third-ranking activity as measured by income. Re-
gionally, as an income producer, it is outranked in the Pa-
cific Northwest only by timber and agriculture.” In Oregon
and Washington the amount spent annually by hunters and

fishermen is estimated at $170,000,000.

PrOper control of game animals is a requisite of the
mutiple-use theory which we have been considering. I have
spoken of forest land uses in terms of timber production,
protection of watersheds and soil, hunting of game. These
factors, together with recreation, combine to make what
industrial forest land owners mean by “multiple-use.”

*- * '1!- *-

The spiritual benefits of recreation are rewards that are
worthy of more promotion and boosting from you and from
me. I do not think it would hurt any of us to broadcast far
and wide the fact that active enjoyment of the out-of-doors
can bring man closer to God and nearer the spiritual satis-
factions we all need—~and somehow do not seem to have

time for.

A beautiful spot on the Toutle River, twelve miles east of
Castle Rock, Washington, on the Spirit Lake Highway, was
the first complete public park opened to visitors by our

company. The large sign, standard for company parks,
marked this one as Coal Banks Park until 1954, when it was

renamed the Harry E. Morgan Park, in honor of the man
who developed this first park.

Soon there were four other parks between this one and the
highway’s terminus at Spirit Lake. One of our newer areas,
and the only one providing boat dock facilities, opened this
year on the Vail Tree Farm. It is Bald Hill Lake Park on a

beautiful large lake which the state game department stocked
with five thousand trout at the beginning of the season. Tall

Activities for the children of airmen

Austin, Texas, a good place to live.

it?

WHEN families know their children are having advantages

usually not found in civilian communities, they are con-
vinced in their belief in the Air Force way of life. Ask any-
one with children at Bergstrom Air Force Base what they
think, and the chances are ninety-nine to one they will tell
you, “We’ve never had it so good. Not only do our children
get a good formal education here, but we have a free-time
youth activities program that is helping to develop our boys
and girls, too.” The latter is led by volunteers.

 

MR. MORRISON is a regional representative of the 0fice of
Community Services, United States Air Force.

NOVEMBER 1956

 

The art class of 28 members is directed by Mrs. James H.
Carson, a volunteer who is a qualified art instructor. Class
meets for two-hour sessions each week at the Youth Center.

 

Pre-Teen Club holds a square dance. Mrs. Ernest Carwile,
pre-teen adviser, helps this group plan and carry out such acti-
vities. T/Sgt. Earl Starkie instructs and calls at the dances.

I asked Mrs. Raymond N. Hubbard, one of the volun-

teers, what was meant by the latter remark and she said,
“Several hundred boys and girls have learned to swim here.
My husband, Colonel Hubbard, teaches boys target shoot-
ing each Saturday. Our girls are learning to sew at a spe-
cial class for sewing; our teen-agers are putting on a play
now with the best possible dramatic training from another
one of our parents. This year some ninety boys have reg-
istered for baseball and they will get professional training
from Captain E. J. Alexander, one-time professional player
in the Texas League. Even if we could afford it, we could
not buy leadership like that. This is an opportunity few
children get.”

I was intrigued by the genuine enthusiasm of every one
for the youth activities program so I decided to see just
what was cooking at Bergstrom. I got up early and I stayed
late. I talked with parent volunteers in numerous activi-
ties, saw them teach a class of girls in tennis. I watched
teen-agers rehearse The Man from Mars. I saw little girls

421

tuing to learn to twirl the baton. I watched Captain Alex-
ander teach an eight-year-old boy how to hold a bat and
how to catch a ball; and I caught some of the enthusiasm

of the ninety boys who came out for practice.

What was more important, I saw the parents’ enthusiasm
too. While 1 watched the ball practice, one dad drove up
and said. “Captain, here’s another player for you. See what
you can do with my boy.” As he started to drive off Captain
Alexander said, “Where are you going? We need your
help.” The dad answered by telling the coach he hadn’t
played ball in twenty years, but that didn’t get him off the
hook. The captain latched onto ten other dads just that
way. Altogether, there are about one hundred and fifty
parents participatina.

The real workhorse behind this outstanding youth pro-

gram is Major Joseph B. Lowrance, Jr., chairman of the
Youth Activities Council. He knows the main mission of Brownie Scout group at the base packages bubble gum

- - - - - to give to underprivileged children in the Austin area.
SAC (Strategic Air Command) is to keep planes in the air, Base (laws on Austin for additional resource people.
but he also knows it takes people to fly planes, to keep planes

repaired, to keep supplies coming. He knows, too, that men
with families who are satisfied with the Air Force way of
life are more ellicient, easier to get along with. The job in
SAC is demanding. Anything that can be done to relieve
SAC people from home worries contributes mightily to its
mission.

 

Two years ago' there was no organized youth activities
program at Bergstrom, and the wives were very articulate
concerning its need. About then, I suggested to Colonel
Murphy, the base commander, that the services of Miss
Helen M. Dauncey, social recreation specialist of the Na-
tional Recreation Association, were available for conducting
a week’s training course for volunteers who might develop
a youth activities program. Colonel Murphy’s answer was,
“i don’t know whether the women will ‘buy’ that sort of
idea or not”; but he introduced me to some of the wives and
later we had a meeting of about thirty-five from the Ofiicers’

Wives Club and the  Wives Club. i a A parent serves as chairman of each program activity.

Here, two Air Force wives (extreme left and right) give
girls expert instruction during weekly tennis class.

 

On one occasion we visited the University of Texas where
we talked with students majoring in recreation. As a result
some thirty of them volunteered to help the base get started.
Actually only a few students were ever used, owing to stu-
dent time-limitation. On another occasion a visit was made

to Randolph Air Force Base where a successful youth pro-
gram had been in operation for some time.

(in March 17, 1955, Colonel Van Mullen, the first Youth
Activities Council chairman, called the first meeting, and

several other meetings were held before he left. In August
1955, Major Lowrance was appointed to replace him.

On the wall of the youth activities building hangs a large
organization chart which indicates the number of commit-

[W's appointed to each type of activity. These list the fol-

A parent serves as chairman of each program and may
choose his own committee members. In most cases the chair-
man is particularly interested and skilled in the specific
activity being promoted. In many cases the parents have
been professionals, so the base is fortunate to be able to
provide its youth with expert leadership.

Until June 1956, this remarkable youth activities pro-
gram was “homemade,” but that fact seemed to give real
meaning and purpose to the effort. Around the middle of
June 1956, Miss Byrd, a school teacher and a major in dra-
matics, was employed as a youth director to assist Major
Lowrance. Colonel Murphy was a bit skeptical about em-
ploying a person for the program because of the danger of
jlosing parent participation and having the program become
'a device for baby-sitting.

It was made clear when Miss Byrd came, that she:

1. Not “operate” a program.

2. Secure more volunteers.

3. Assist committee chairmen in their program such as
-alling committee members for meetings, to remind them of

 
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
     
     
 
 
   
  
 

issigned obs, and so on.

4. Assist the over-all chairman, Major Lowrance, in
nany ways, such as keeping notes, writing minutes of meet-
ngs, making detailed arrangements for meetings, and rec-

:mmending needed programs.

' 5. Aid in getting publicity for the program.

6. Assist in coordinating events, making arrangements
or facilities.

7. Make acquaintances in Austin, the civilian commu-
‘ :ity, especially among those engaged in similar programs
nd in the municipal recreation department, so fullest ad-
antage can be taken of additional resource people—leader-
j' hip for special activities.

Colonel Murphy’s acceptance of the idea of hiring a youth
irector was based upon a general acceptance of these seven
oints of policy. But the one major determining factor,
'hen an appraisal is made of the value of having a youth
irector, will be, “Are there more or fewer parents assuming
esponsibility for the conduct of the youth activities pro-
ram?”

The question of providing a youth center building was
iscussed early in 1955 and it was finally agreed that one
f the temporary H-shaped structures would serve this pur-
ose. The building needed repairs, paint, and some equip-
tent; but through the efforts of the parents it was made
 try attractive and useable, even to installation of an air-
‘,‘ )nditioning unit.

i

' The question of whether it should be kept Open seven days
1d nights a week is currently up for discussion. It seems
etty certain that the policy will be to keep it open only
r scheduled events, with the exception of possibly one
ght a week. The building is not considered a hangout
t a facility to assist in a broad developmental type of pro-

» I OVEMBER 1956

gram. The building is only incidental and no attempt is
made to “run a program in it.” There are more programs
and projects away from it than in it.

Such a policy certainly would meet the sound objections
of many parents that everything today is done to take their
children away from home. In all instances Colonel Murphy
and Major Lowrance are emphasing instructional and de-
velopmental programs and many of these, such as the sewing
class, are carried on right in the homes.

Every SAC base is supposed to have a youth activities
program but few have tried to this extent. The big reason
for this one is the support from the front office. Colonel
Murphy, addressing all parents about the program, wrote
in part: '

“A properly supervised recreational program for our
boys and girls, consistent with the ever-increasing number
of children, has been established. The importance of this
program cannot be overemphasized. In order to maintain
these activities and to assure that they function properly,
it is mandatory that all parents actively participate. Our
program is designed to assure that we do everything pos-
sible to make certain that our children grow up to be the

best citizens possible . . . .
“The youth center is open for recreational purposes on

weekdays during the hours of 1600 to 1900, and on Satur-
days and Sundays from 1330 to 1900 hours. Facilities avail-
able in the building have been donated and/ or purchased
from monies donated for the purpose. Any child or children
misbehaving at the youth center or at any of scheduled activ-_
ities will be requested to leave and may possibly be barred

from future activities.

“Since money received for maintaining the equipment
and recreation facilities available to our children is donated
from interested activities, sufEcient funds are not available
to completely finance numerous programs beneficial to all.
Therefore, it is expected that the parents will support their
children in individual activities, by taking care of nominal
costs for their own child’s individual equipment.

“The success of our activities requires chaperones for
groups of children for certain activities. Our Youth Activi'
ties Council is composed of parents who have volunteered
to head certain projects; however, the success of the entire
program depends upon all of the parents. In the event you
are requested as a parent to assist in some activity, it is
essential that you understand your responsibility. Failure
on the part of the parents will result in the breakdown of
our youth program and the eventual closing of the youth
center.

“I feel certain that this worthwhile program is a great
achievement. The many beneficial things that our children
may learn today will assist them in their everyday walk of
life in later days.”

There is little wonder why Bergstrom has a youth activi-
ties program. Such support as is indicated by the above
letter will always get the job done. Further, this letter illus-
trates the really amazing simplicity of the job of making
the Air Force way of life satisfying and rewarding to its
devoted personnel. I

Let’s Take a Lo

$“

at v Our Public Relations

One of the most important phases 0 f suc-
cessful management and operation of a
city parks and recreation department!

ANNUALLY MILLIONS of dollars are spent by private enter-

prise to acquaint the public with goods or services, and
to foster desirable public relations. Public recreation de-
partments, though they spend considerably less, send out
folders, circulars, and work through the media of radio,
television, newspapers, and professional journals to attain
the same result. Yet, all of this “selling ob” becomes com-
pletely ineffective when not accompanied by the right atti-
tude toward the public with whom we work. Indeed, good
relations built up over the years can be completely destroyed
by one ill-chosen or unthinking remark.

Many of our large businesses realize the vital need for
good public relations, not only on an over-all company to
public basis, but on an individual employee to individual
customer basis. They go so far, as in the instance of one
major company, as to incorporate public relations training
in their technical training, and to have a personnel officer
who does nothing at all other than grade each person work-
ing in his particular branch of the company on courtesy,
interested and helpful manner or, as they term it, “the over-
tones of service.” Another large company makes no pro-
vision for public relations training, but simply states that
“it is expected of all our employees.” Thus we have two
extreme attitudes toward the business of public relations;
and public relations is a business.

Public relations is not just a part of a recreator’s job;
it is almost entirely his whole job. To define public relations,
let us say that it is the inevitable result of our day-to-day
contacts with peOple, both in person and through press,
radio and other media, in rendering the service for which
the department was created, and as a result of which it will
expand or decline. There are two major breakdowns in ways
that good public relations may be developed and main-
tained—actual personal contact and outside publicity. We
are most concerned with the first of these; for, in our pro-
fession, actual personal contact is one of the most vital and
eflicicnt ways we have of doing our job.

Although volumes could be written concerning a staff
member’s contact with the public, individually or as a group,
we wish only to state the fundamental characteristics of good
public relations, with the (emphasis on how you, as a mem-
ber of the recreation department staff, should uphold your

end of the public relation- job. Each staff member is in a

position where the dcvchqnnont of good public "Julions is

his opportunity and responsibility. Let each person served
leave you with the feeling that his visit has been worthwhile
. . . and remember, chances are he will tell his friends.
Remember to . . .

° Be courteous, friendly and thoughtful.

' Use all available information to help solve each problem.
° Do not be indifferent, impatient, inaccurate or vague.

° Treat each problem with the sincere interest and respect
which it is due.

Tips

A few further tips, on the right and wrong ways of main-
taining good public relations:

Sincere Attention. Remember, every individual’s problem
is important to him. Don’t guess about his problem—if you
don’t know the right answer, find out before you reply.

The “We’re Doing You a Favor Touch.” There are few

approaches that are more irritating to a visitor than being
treated with a condescending air. Any implication that he
is receiving a favor from you or that you expect gratitude
for your service has no place in the service that the public
is paying us to render them.

I"
The “Brush-01?.” Adherents of this technique, more oftenf
than not, do not know they are using it. But their partiall

l

answers to questions, vague letters, and indifference to prob;-

lems all add up to one big “brush-off,” and one lost oppor-
tunity to render service.

    
   
     
   
   
  

Specific Referral. Find out who it is that actually handles
the matter before making a referral; then give specific in-
structions on the proper procedure.

Prompt Handling. If you can’t avoid a delay, explain it.
Most people realize that you can’t do more than one thing at
a time; they just want to know that you haven’t forgotten
them. With the current workload it isn’t possible to do every-
thing promptly; but considerate, attentive handling will dc
much to lessen antagonism caused by necessary delays. h

Patience and Fortitude. Stay on an even keel even thoug
the person with whom you are dealing is unreasonable 01
downright impolite. The man who remains polite in ha

up

dling unreasonable people has the upper hand all the way.

The “Run-A round.” This techniqueconsists largely of send-
ing a visitor to the first person who seems to be available.
This process may give the visitor a wide circle of acquaint-
ances but seldom helps him solve his problems.

The “Let Them Wait” Attitude. This is based on the falla-

cious theory that “things” are more important than pe0ple.
Keeping a visitor waiting for recognition seldom impresses
him, and never fails to irritate him. ~

The T emperamental Touch. The technique of displaying
1emotion while handling service problems seldom fails to
lput things in an uproar. Its possessor can be counted on to
get excited when people are vague about what they want,
when they don’t understand regulations, or when they are
impatient. He leads a hard life and so do the pe0ple who
deal with him.

 
  
  
  
 
 
 
   
  
   
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
   
   
 
 

 

Remember that your attitude toward your work will re-
flect on those persons for and with whom you are working.
Keep your opinions and dissatisfactions to yourself. How
can we expect the public to be satisfied when we show our
own dissatisfaction? Be genuinely interested in everything
that you do. People are not as “blind” as we sometimes
hink them, and disinterest and insincerity are mirrored
for all to see more often than we realize. Courtesy must
reflect naturalness and sincerity. It must not appear cold,
impersonal, affected, or overdone. No one could be better
ware than those of us engaged in working with the public
ow difficult it is to meet criticism, sometimes unjustified,
with a smile. But all criticism, right or wrong, should be
eceived with individual consideration, and with a genuine
j pirit of willingness to correct whatever might be wrong.
i Each contact, whether face to face, by telephone or corre-
 spondence, should be regarded as presenting an Opportu-
' nity to build up a liking for and a confidence in the depart-
ent. It is most important that you remain relaxed,
' self-confident and natural. None of us are perfect, and it is
not expected that we be. It is possible, th0ugh, to. choose
he privacy of your own home or office to “let off steam,”
nd to keep all thoughtlessness in your manner to a mini-
. um. Being pleasant is a habit which is easy to form.

The “Courtesy Habit”

Try these few ways to get into the “courtesy habit” and
'ee how easy it will become for you:

oliteness—Practice being Well mannered.
usiness Etiquette—Conform to the generally accepted re-

uirement of good business manners in all dealings with
ublic.

ourteous Response—Acknowledge or respond politely to
reetings, statements, comments, complaints, questions or
losing remarks which obviously require response. Noth-
ng is more irritating or annoying than to ask someone

OVEM BER 1956

something and receive complete dead silence. Even an “I

don’t know,” or “I don’t care” would be less offending than
that!

Appreciation—Express thanks or appreciation where it
would be good manners to do so. It is in bad taste, however,
to overthank or superfluously thank someone.

Indicate, through the use of appropriate words, regret
where we have made a mistake, have failed to keep a prom-
ise, service is out of order or not up to standards, “customer”
has been caused real inconvenience.

Remember to express sympathy for personal or family
trouble mentioned by “customer” where it would be good
judgment to do so. This, though not really necessary, goes
a long way toward making a citizen feel really “warm”
towards the department.

Telephone Etiquette

Telephone etiquette should receive special consideration
since a major part of our public relations is carried on
over the telephone.

This may seem elementary, but let’s consider the way we
answer the telephone. People receive their first impression
of us the first time they hear us, and if the way in which we
answer the phone is not courteous and-friendly, they will
get the wrong impression right away. Simplicity is the key-
note for most business organizations, and though it may not
be your particular job to answer the phone, there always
comes a time when it falls your lot to do so. When it does,
state the name of your organization in a well-modulated,
clearly understood voice. It is not considered good business
etiquette to simply say “hello.” In our case, “Parks and
Recreation Department” is the best possible answering
statement, and the one preferred by our administration
head. If someone calls for a staff member who is out of the
office, tell him when that person is expected to return, ask
if you can be of service or if you might take a message.

Always obtain the person’s consent before transferring
this call to another employee. When leaving the line, be

 

sure to do so in such a way that. the. person on the other end
knows what you are doing and why; for example, when
answering a call for Mr. Smith, say “Just a moment, please,”
or “I will connect you with .” If you leave the phone
to look up something, don’t rush into the original t0pic'
without first re-addressing the person on the line: “Mrs.

Jones, this is Mr. Brown again, I have found that informa-

tion you asked for . . . .”

These are the things that are generally expected of us,
but you’d be surprised how many times we forget to do
them in'the rush of everyday office routine. N o matter how
busy or tired you may be, always keep in mind that some

of our “customers” never have contact with the department
993—)-

H

425

except over the phone.

Sincere Interest

Now we come to something we forget too often .’ Giving
an over-all impression of sincere interest and a Spirit of help-
fulness is a basic foundation for good public relations. Peo-
ple like to feel that they are receiving personal attention
and that we are the easiest and most pleasant people in
the world to deal with. No matter how bothersome they
may seem, or how irritating and rude they may be to you
either through correspondence, by phone or face-to-face,
it is your job to sell the public on what your organization
has to offer, and to make them come back for more. Satis-
faction with the product—in our case, recreation—is the
important thing with any business. So bite back that short
retort, wipe that pained look off your face, give a big smile
and say in your most pleasant, friendly voice, “I’m very
sorry this happened, Mrs. ___. We’ll do everything in
our power to remedy it immediately.” And even harder to
say, but even more ellective too, “You’re absolutely right,
I am in error, and I assure you I will make every effort to

correct the fault.” It takes courage to admit you’re wrong
when you’re wrong. Set your “patience” button on go and
keep it turned there always, and you’vetaken one giant step
forward to excellent relations with the public.

Our Relation to the Citizen

Let’s not forget some of the facts of our own profession:

1. A citizen is not a person with whom to argue or match wits.
Arguing wastes time and convinces no one of anything but your own
lack of intelligence.

2. A citizen ’is the most important person to enter this oliice, in
person, by mail or by telephone.

3. A citizen is not dependent upon us; on the contrary, we are
dependent upon him.

4. A citizen is not an interruption of our work . . . he is the purpose
of it.

5. A citizen is not an outsider in our work . . . he is part of it.

6. A citizen is not (and this is most important to remember) a
cold statistic. He is a flesh-and-blood human being with feelings and
emotions like our own.

7. The citizen is the most important person with whom we deal.

8. A citizen is a person who brings us his problems. It is our job
to handle them in such a way as to be beneficial to him and to our-
selves. l

library. The success of these programs
may be limited by small staff personnel
and budgets, but these difficulties can
be surmounted by close community co-
operation. Several organizations have
done much to help create forms of serv-
ice not generally available in a small
city library.

One of the most outstanding exam-
ples of coordination between the library
and a woman’s club has been the sup-
port given in 1953 by the Twin Falls
Music Club in purchasing for the li-
brary a group of one hundred records
as the nucleus of a lending collection.
Since the inception of the program of
renting standard and LP records at a
nominal two cents a day (for breakage
and replacement fund), the library has
been able to provide a popular service.

A children’s story and music record
collection was started last year, and has
also been extremely popular. A recent
gift of a Webcor three-speed phono-
graph by the music club has been used
during a weekly Saturday story hour
and has permitted an occasional Thurs-

day evening concert hour of “Recorded
Musical Highlights.”

Other groups have also supple-
menlcd the library facilities. The Roe
tary (31th has contributed new books

donated library equipment, and the
Kiwanis Club has maintained a current
Boy Scout Merit Badge pamphlet file.
Many other organizations have also co-
Operated to broaden the scope of mate-
rials available to the community. The
library and the city recreation commis-
sion have joined forces in presentation
of summer playground story hour pro-
grams. Newspaper, radio and television
facilities have been made available to

An analysis for teachers that can be of utmost

H"

CREATIVE DRAMATICS is probably one of the least under-
stood and most misused media through which children
express themselves. In determining the values of creative
dramatics as a deve10pmental process in teaching and learn-
ing, we must relate this medium to the goals and aspirations
of the elementary school curriculum. High among these
curriculum goals and aspirations are: helping each child to
deve10p self-understanding; helping each child to relate to
the world in which he lives; helping each child to extend his
experiences in living.

In a sense these goals are interrelated, but each is also
unique and distinct. These may be explored in terms of
creative dramatics which contributes to each and offers the
child Opportunities for continuously extending his experi-
ence in all aspects of living. The teacher plays an important
role in making it possible for him to reach these curriculum
goals and aspirations, for she is the key factor in determin-
ing the kind of curriculum she builds with her children. To
build a curriculum in which all appropriate resources will
be utilized to foster the best deve10pment of the child, art
in all its aspects assumes a major role.

Art is inherently a quality of living which fosters the in-
tegration of personality. Its effectiveness is revealed through
the behavior of the learner while engaged in a variety of
art experiences, of which creative dramatics is one. Crea-
tive dramatics is an art medium which has high potential

for helping the child to become more integrated. If it pro-
vides Opportunities for genuine expression, creative dra-
matics helps the child to identify himself and to relate to
others, to understand why he acts as he does and, therefore,
to better understand the behavior of others. In addition,
creative dramatics frees the child to use past experience in
making new meanings out of present experience. This, in
essence, is the extension of experience-in-living which edu-
cation seeks to guide and direct.

A modern elementary school conceives of the curriculum
as problem centered, that is, built around the problems
children experience in living. In creative dramatics, as in
any truly genuine art experience, the child draws upon the
meanings he has developed in past experiences to help him
solve his needs in the current situation. He not only en-
larges upon these earlier meanings, but makes new ones in
the process of creating. It can be said that creative dra-
matics is the process of making meanings which will foster
the integration of the child in his world.

To help the child grow toward his ultimate maturity
through creative dramatics, the teacher must be sensitive to
the problems of her children, aware of their needs, informed
regarding available resources and skilled in creating an en-
vironment in which children will be well nurtured.

One of the least used yet most easily available tools that
each teacher has to help her study her children, to learn
their needs, is the critical observation of the children them-
selves when teacher and children are together. Looking at
children with eyes that see is an attribute of mature and

mented with some doubt in his voice, “I’m really Michael,
you know.” His teacher sensed that Michael’s character-
ization of Hoppy threatened his own identity. At four, the
play was too real and too long. While the play involved
' children, Michael could take things in stride; when it in—
\ volved grown-ups, his security was shaken. The teacher
who would help children develop self-understanding must
control or influence factors in the situations in which crea-
tive eXpression thrives. Learning to distinguish the real
from the unreal is a developmental task of childhood. Cre-
ative dramatics has a role to play in the achievement of this

goal but the guiding hand of the skillful teacher is needed.

Helping Each Child to Relate
Walt Whitman speaks of,

. . . the sense of what is real, the thought if after all it should
prove unreal,

The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious
whether and how,

Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and
specks? ""

All living is in a sense an attempt to seek an identity with
the world in which we live. The child lives in a fabulous
world of changing sounds and smells“, of long and fascinat-
ing days and short, obliterating nights. These changes in
the child’s physical world may be a threat as well as a chal-
lenge to his imagination. Changes in his relationships with
people may be an even greater threat or challenge to his
imagination and his well being. Creative dramatics offers
keys to the child in determining his relationships to the
world in which he lives and offers an important instrument
to teachers in helping the child establish himself in desir-
able ways in his world.
The play corner in the first-grade room encourages Billie
to become “Daddy” and to be big and powerful, big and
strong, or big and gentle. The housekeeping center helps
Janie become “Mother” or “Grandmother” as she washes
- and irons, gossips on the telephone, or berates “Father”

before he goes to work. One of the best interpretations of
l home life as it affects the child is depicted through such free
.- creative play and the wise teacher will “listen in” fre-
I quently. In the same way parents will be helped to see

teachers and teachers will be helped to see themselves by
i listening in to “school play” at home. When Sallie becomes
, “Miss Foley,” her third grade teacher, she tells through. her
I characterization whether or not Miss Foley is kind and easy,
1 gentle but firm, strict but fair, or vindictive and cold. What-
: ever the characterization, interpretation by the observer
should be seasoned with restraint, for children, like carica-
turists, emphasize extremes. I

of the players. Role playing is characterized by sponta-
neity and feeling. The skillful teacher, concerned with the
problem of fostering each child’s progress toward increas-
ingly more mature behavior, will use creative dramatics as a
process frequently in her teaching.

In an important sense, creative dramatics typifies the
“learning through doing” philosophy of the modern school.
Robert Browning illustrates the clarification of meaning, .
the heightening of interest and the emotional appeal which
characterize creative dramatics in good teaching, in his
poem, “Development.”

My father was a scholar and knew Greek.
When I was five years old, I asked him once
“What do you read about?”

“The siege of Troy.”
“What is the siege, and what is Troy?”

Whereat

He piled up chairs and table for a town,
Set me a-top for Priam, called our cat
———Helen, enticed away from home (he said)
By wicked Paris, who couched somewhere close
Under the footstool, being cowardly,
But whom—since she was worth the pains, poor puss—w
Towzer and Tray,—our dogs, the Atreidai,———sought
By taking Troy to get possession of
———Always when great Achilles ceased to sulk,
(My pony in the stable) --forth would prance
And put to Hight Hector—our page-boy’s self.
This taught me who was who and what was what:
So far I rightly understood the case
At five years old: a huge delight it proved
And still proves——-—thanks to that instructor sage
My Father, who knew better than to turn straight
Learning’s full glare on weak-eyed ignorance,
0r, worse yet, leave weak eyes to grow sand-blind;
Content with darkness and vacuity.

In Stefan Zweig’s autobiography, The World of Yester-
day, he makes a profound observation in recalling the ex-
periences of his childhood and youth: “. . . only he who
has learned early to spread his soul out wide may later hold

'the entire world within himself.” Creative dramatics is a

medium which has the potential for helping boys and girls
create a real world in which it is possible to live in harmony
with oneself and with others. It has the potential for help-
ing them create a real world in which the iniinite holds no
terrors, for peace of mind and spirit are living companions.
The only possible way we have of helping boys and girls to
become ready for the future is to help them live well and
fully in the present. If teachers can help children to de-
velop the know-how and the courage and the spirit to deal
well with their current problems in living, there need be no
fear for their future for they will be equipped to deal with
the unknown. Creative dramatics is an important medium
in the education of such children. I

The Center Volunteers Built

Henry Robinson, recreation director
in Aiken, South Carolina, is very proud
of his new community center, built
through the active participation of vol-
unteers. The total cost of the building
was only about $10,000, because local
union members contributed their time,
and much of the material was provided
free. In other cases, such as that of the
hardwood Hooring, the manufacturer
offered a special price. A great deal of
effort was devoted to salvaging waste
materials from the abandoned airport
and other places, while some of the lum-
ber was actually cut from city property.
Community drives netted over $8,000
to buy necessary materials.

Youth Group Receives Award
The Young People’s Council of Hill-

side Homes, Br'onx, New York, received -

a certificate of honor in Parents’ Mag-
azine 1955—56 Youth Group Achieve-
ment Awards for distinguished service
to the community. These awards were
inaugurated in 1954 to encourage and
give recognition to young people’s clubs
engaged in useful public service. Of
the hundreds of nominations received
in this year’s contest, an editorial in
the September issue of Parents’ Maga-
zine says, “They are good examples of
the fact that juvenile decency is far
more prevalent than juvenile delin-
quency.”

The award to the Young People’s
Council is based on the initiation and
work of their annual toy campaign for
the children of Bellevue Hospital, for
their contribution to the National Foun-
dation for Muscular Dystrophy as a re-
sult of their “Tops in Pops” teen—age:
popularity contest, for sponsoring a
jazz workshop in their community, for
building a teen-age lounge which has
enriched the recreation program of the {
community, and for adopting and sup-,
porting a thirteen-year-old Lithuanian}
girl, a displaced person, in Germany.

Fairyland
Puppet Theatre

The Children’s F airy-
land puppet theatre in
Lakeside Park, Oakland,
California, has become
one of the most popular
features in Fairyland in
the short time 'it has been
operating. Built in the
shape of an open book, the
puppet theatre is designed with a hydraulically Operated stage so, that it can be
used for hand puppets, marionettes, stick and string pUppets of all kinds.

Children sit on low, colored benches, supported by mushrooms built with a
steel armature covered with cement. Two hundred children can watch the show
at one time. 

The stage Opening is eight feet wide by four and a half feet high. The pages
of the book on” each side of the stage are fourteen feet high, eight feet thick,
twenty-five feet long, and are constructed of cement over a wooden frame. Jimmie
and Susie Bookworm peer out from the pages of the book to the delight of the
youngsters. Behind the leaves of the book are the puppet workshop, restroom
facilities and scenery storage space.

Three free puppet shows are given daily: two variety shows and a play from
a favorite child’s story. The Milk Drivers’ and Dairy Employees’ Union, Local
302, sponsors the performances, making it possible to give the shows without
charge to visitors in Children’s Fairyland. The performances are created by the

most important feature, however, is a
large, covered play area with a polished
concrete floor. This offers both shade

and shelter—the convenience of an out-
door area with many of the advantages
of an indoor one.

ness, with the aid of many civic-minded
citizens, until it had built the area into

Importance of

.PLAY

Children learn by doing. Potentially, play can give
them a chance to practice what they have learned in
school, at home, and elsewhere. Anything that really
interests a child is play to him. As he plays he learns.
Joseph Lee said, “It is the supreme seriousness of play
that gives it its educational importance.”

A good play program J‘should provide children with
qualified leaders, appropriate space (indoors and out),
and enough of the right kind of play materials and
equlpment.

A year ago a group of nine-year-olds, in a public
school in New York City, lived their days happily with
an understanding leader. While they played, thousands
of feet of film were shot, and hundreds of hours were
~pcnt in selecting scenes from this to show a consecutive

Children may build the world to their

or very little or even nothing at all.

When nine-year-olds (left) say, "Let's build

mean a real house. This contains an upper

“W e should have theatres o f our own throughout the country,
where our young people could work and learn and stretch

themselves.”—Eva Le Gallienne.

WIIEREVER there are people who are
willing to learn and who want to
have fun, there can be a drama group
and eventually a community theatre.
But a community theatre is not possible
unless you have a drama specialist.

The main reason many recreation
departments do not have a drama spe-
cialist is because they really do not
want .them. They’ll tell you, “Sorry,
no budget for such,” and even believe
it. However, if you had money in your
budget for a swimming pool, money i or
night baseball, money for crafts and ad-
ditional playground facilities, then you
can find or raise the money to hire a
drama specialist or community theatre
director. It is a matter of selling your
citizens and your board on the values
of such a program.

Any and all recreation departments
have a great opportunity and a respon-
sibility, to themselves, to their commu-
nities, to the American theatre, for
starting a community theatre and thus
helping preserve living theatre in this
country.

All too frequently, a recreation di-
rector will toss a book of plays at a
non-drama person on his staff and at
the same time say, “Go out and start a

drama program.” It won’t work. The
same director would never think of tell-
ing a non-swimmer to “go out and start
a swimming program.” The person
starting the drama program must be a
drama specialist.

I recently heard Grace Stanistreet,
one of the National Recreation Associ-
ation’s drama committee members, say,
“Recreation can make a greater con-
tribution to people when the word ‘rec-
reation’ becomes a symbol not only of
opportunities in physical activities but
in the arts as well. Recreation will have
matured when there is as much empha-
sis on the selection and training of
leaders for the drama program as for
the sports program.”

Once you have hired a drama spe-
cialist, one who has been professionally
trained in directing, acting, set design-
ing, stage managing, house managing,
publicity, lighting, and one who can
teach acting, you will have made the
first move in starting a drama group
and eventually establishing a success-
ful community theatre.

The following question has come up
many times in many places: “Just how
does a community start a community

theatre?”

A drama specialist going into a com-
munity would first need to form the
nucleus of the drama group. To find
this nucleus he or she could begin by
attending any and all community func-

tions. (:0 to every high-school play,
graduation, prom, banquet, community

party, sports event, church program,
holiday celebration, and so on. At any
and all of these community social func-
tions, he would be on the lookout for
talent. (When I say talent I am not
talking about some child dressed in a
little frilly skirt who comes out on the
stage to tap dance, on amateur night,
while her mother waits in the wings
ready to push her back on the stage
if she runs ioff.) He would be looking
for the medical man in the community,
who, by making a speech at the Rotary
luncheon indicated that he liked to talk
to people and to share his professional
knowledge with them. (Here’s a po-
tential drama group person!) Also,
he would be looking for the member of
the sports team who obviously plays
for the love of the game and takes great
pride in being a good player—for him-
self. (Here is a potential actor!) At
community parties and dances he would
be looking for the man, woman, boy,
or girl who shows an interest in enter-
taining others either by hostessing,
talking, singing, making decorations,
arranging flowers, building, painting,
or taking part in a dramatic stunt or
skit. If these people have shown that
they do their entertaining and duties
with dignity, integrity, and respect for
what they do—along with a desire to
help people have fun—then, they, too,
are needed to help form a drama group.

people!) Naturally the specialist would
be keeping a list of the'se people as he
made his community rounds.

Your specialist would be combing
the community looking for peOple who
would take a community theatre pro-
' gram seriously, people who would auto-
matically bring an honesty to it, the
kind of honesty they bring to their pro-
fessions, their play, and their lives. A
drama specialist (or theatre director)
would need people with this approach
to life, for without it a person would
not take a theatre program seriously
———and by seriously, I mean, willing to
learn to act and gain a knowledge of
theatre techniques in general which is
the basis of any successful community
theatre. Could you accomplish this
without a drama specialist? No, not
anymore than you could have a rip-
roaring sports program without a
sport specialist.

I’m quite certain that some reader
has already said, “Look, we’re not in-
terested in training actors or actresses.
We want our pe0ple to have fun. This
is recreation.”

Here is where many recreation dra-
ma programs and community theatres
fail. What reason is there for having
a community theatre if each and every
individual in it does not undertake the
job and fun of learning to act, of learn-
ing about the theatre?

In all other activities in a recreation
program, the most respected and” ad-
mired person is the one who has ex-
celled in a game, sport, art or craft.
In a successful community theatre the
members must approach their “recrea-
tional acting” with the same attitude
as they would stepping up to homeplate
and saying, “Golly, I want to hit a home
run this time!” By the same token, the
audience (or community) must have
the same attitude toward the good actor

or actress as they do toward the local
golf champ.

   
   
  
    
   
  

Only when a theatre company is in-
terested in learning to act and knowing
about the theatre, and the community
and sponsoring members have a re-
pectful attitude toward drama in gen-
ral, can you have a functioning com-
munity theatre. And, frankly, if your
ommunity isn’t interested in the lon-
evity of a theater, which would be self-
“upporting and eventually produce an

 

Of course, nothing can destroy the
living theatre—nothing ever has and
nothing ever will—but I sometimes get
impatient when I hear people talk about
“How wonderful it would be if . . . I”
Why don’t they do something, or at
least try to do it?——Eva Le Gallienne.*

income, then there’s no point in starting
one at all.

A community theatre must ultimately
become so vital that your city or town
could not afford to lose it. It must be a
necessity —— economically, emotionally,
and spiritually. And to work toward
this indispensable theatre, it is impos-
sible to begin by doing what so many,
many towns and cities have done: form
a “drama group” by getting a few peo-
ple together for one evening a week or
month to do stunts, skits, or just plain

“kidding around on a stage.”**

Learning about the theatre and learn-
ing to act in particular is one of the
most rewarding eXperiences a person
can have. It is not just for the person
who wants to make acting his career
and his profession, anymore than base-
ball is just for those few who can be-
come Yankees or Dodgers. Acting is
for everybody! Good acting is fun;
and the better it is, the more fun it is,
just as the better game of tennis or golf
you play, the more fun it is to play.

In a community theatre, as in the
professional theatre, there is no reason
to put on a play without training for
it first. A tennis player doesn’t enter a
community tennis tournament with lit-
tle or no practice. It is the same with
an actor. The actor does not take a
script and begin rehearsing for a play
until he learns something about theatre
and the art of acting. Once he is trained
he has earned the fun and excitement
of taking part on the court or the stage,
which ever the case may be.

Let me ask a question: How many
people in your community who are in-
terested in theatre (not to mention the
other arts) as 'a career are forced to

** This is not to say that there isn’t a place
for stunts and skits. There is, but the people
doing them should first realize that stunts or
skits have nothing to do with drama. They
should also be aware that stunts or skits
aren’t the ultimate in material written for the

stage.

look to the big cities for outlets for
their talents? This is one of the most
unfortunate circumstances in America
today. Yet, with understanding and
help, they can stay in their home cities
and use their artistic talents. Give them
the opportunity; they’ll show you the
results. '

The American theatre is not just the

tween 42nd and 59th Street, the beloved
Broadway area. It is right on your
doorstep, if you want it. The entire re-
sponsibility for keeping the American
theatre alive is not just up to the Ten-
nessee Williams, the Lillian Hellmans,‘

How these are successfully promoted and conducted by th

MOST EVERYONE as a youngster has enjoyed the healthful
experience of sidewalk roller skating. However, today,
the ever-present hazards of city living have not only re-
stricted the youngster’s skating on concrete driveways or
sidewalks, but have limited skaters from developing beyond
the keep-from-falling stage.

In recent years, recreation departments throughout the
country have given much thought to developing roller skat-
ing activities. Some cities have constructed concrete slabs
for roller skating, and some have developed combination
concrete wading and sprinkling pools which also can be
used for roller skating.

Nearly a year ago, the Los Angeles City Recreation and
Park Department experimented with indoor roller skating
in recreation center auditoriums. Several community build-
ings were selected for size and types of floors. As these ex—
periments were conducted, it was observed that the size of
the auditorium was a contributing factor to the program’s
degree of success, and that Hoors which were large enough
for basketball games were suitable for skating.

The kind of floor had no effect on the program—parquet,
asphalt tiling, and other types of flooring were suitable.
Fiber-wheel skates proved to be best. In fact, where limited
to one or two sessions a week, it was found that skating
helped to condition the floors for other activities, such as
dancing and gym classes! It was observed that baseboards
of the rooms sometimes were scuffed, and that this was be-
cause of skate frames extending beyond the soles of shoes.
It was also discovered that if nuts on the axles of the skates
extended beyond the wheels, they caused welts and marks
on the floors. This was eliminated, to a great degree, by
replacing ordinary skate wheels with offset wheels, on which
the nuts are countersunk and are flush with the wheels.

After these experiments were made, the department pur-
chased eight hundred pairs of clamp-on used skates from a
defunct skating rink; and the idea of traveling roller skat-
ing rinks was inaugurated. Several commercial rinks gave
much help in the promotion of the program by assisting the
department in determining rules and regulations for the
best operation of the activity. Some operators even sup-
plied organ-music recordings to help with the program.

its plans continued and interest began to develop, six
traveling units were formed and the traveling roller skat-
ing rinks began their schedule of operation. Each unit was
under the supervision of trained skating personnel and
traveled from one playground to another. A full-time per-
son was employed to oversee the program, keep skates in
repair, and furnish the units wilh tickets, posters, organ-

Department says its roller skating program is
for “folks of all ages.” To prove it, here is

; and weighs approximately fifty pounds. The total number
' of pairs of skates a unit carries is one hundred and forty-
four pairs, and skate sizes run from one to nine. The thir-
‘: teenth box in the unit contains ticket rolls, cash box, a
record album which contains twelve recordings of organ
music adaptable for roller skating, skate keys, card signs,
and other paraphernalia necessary for the complete opera-
tion of the skate program. The fourteenth box is for skates
- which are put out of service and are in need of repair.

Skating units are set up for operation by placing the

OVEMBER 1956

skate boxes along one wall of the foyer or clubroom adja-
cent and accessible to the auditorium. Banquet tables serve
as a counter, and benches or chairs are set up along the
opposite wall for the skaters to use in fastening and strap-
ing on their skates.

The transporting of the skating equipment is arranged
through the district director in cooperation with the dis-
trict foreman. The equipment is transported from one
playground to another on days that the playgrounds have a
scheduled skating program.

Skate Rental Fees

1. Rental fees for skates are as follows: twenty cents for
children sixteen years of age and under; thirty-five cents
for those seventeen years and over.

2. For skaters having their own skates, admission is ten
cents for youngsters sixteen years and under, and twenty
cents for those seventeen years and over.

3. Any skate that has fiber, rubber, or wood wheels will
be permitted. Skates with metal wheels are prohibited.

4. Persons wearing tennis shoes will not be permitted to
rent skates.

5. Rental skate fees are collected by the skate directors
who, upon arrival at a playground, confirm with the play-
ground director the beginning number on each ticket roll.
This is recorded on the roller skating report. At the end of
the day’s business, the skate operator confirms with the rec-
reation director the ending number on each roll and turns
over to the recreation director all monies taken in according
to the tickets sold, along with the roller skating report. The
recreation director then fills out the report and makes out
a triplicate receipt showing the beginning and ending num-
ber from each ticket roll. The blue receipt is given to the
skate director and the pink receipt and white roller skating
report form are mailed to the central ofiice with the weekly
transmittal.

Skating Periods or Sessions

1. Request and approval of scheduling a roller skating
program at a recreation center is made through the district
director.

2. All skating periods or sessions are of two-hour dura-
tion and are usually matinee and evening sessions, and are
held once weekly or twice monthly depending on the local
playground program scheduled. It is preferable to hold
matinee sessions from 3:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. and evening
sessions from 7:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. Usually the afternoon
sessions are held for children sixteen and under, and the
evening sessions are for those seventeen years and over.
However, there is no set or fast rule on the age breakdown.
Local playground conditions should determine the age clas-

sifications for the two sessions.
3. In the evening session, children, when accompanied

by their parents, are permitted to skate regardless of age.

4. A playground may schedule an afternoon or evening
session, or both.

5. When skating interest subsides or it is desirable to
discontinue the activity on any playground for a while, dis-
trict directors may transfer the program to another play-
ground.

6. The skating program operates the year around on de-
partment facilities.

Supervision

l.” The recreation director of the local playground shall
have charge and supervision of the skating program and
shall provide a turntable and amplifier for organ music
recording.

2. The recreation director shall also select a responsible
person to take charge of playing the records and to manipu-
late the card signs for each session’s skating program.

3. With assistance from the skate director, the recrea-
tion director shall select four or fiVe boys from the local
playground as skate boys to help fasten and put on the par-
ticipant’s skates.

Skate Directors

1. Usually two skate directors are assigned to each unit
during the skating sessions, and are responsible to the local
recreation director. The skate director is also responsible
for collecting skate rental fees, the fastening and clamping
on of skates, and supervising the floor. The district director,
when he deems it necessary, may decrease or increase the
munhcr of skate directors aSsigncd to a playground, accord-
ing to the interest in the activity.

2. The two uniformed operators are also responsible and
assist the local recreation director in the enforcement of
the department’s flour rules and safety regulations, and
store out-of-operation skates needing repairs.

3. Skate directors are appointed and assigned to each

time will visit the various skating sessions to replace tickets,
records, straps and other skating equipment. He will also
pick up month-old tear-off tickets and blue receipts and
assist the director and skate director for the best interest
in the conduct of the activity.
Skating Rules and Regulations

Safety is the primary factor to be considered in the roller
skating program. Chairs and tables should be removed
from the skating area. Spectators shall not be permitted
unless the auditorium has a .stage or balcony which will
permit seating of spectators. Skaters shall not be permitted f ,
to leave the auditorium or building during the skating ses- '
sions. Not more than single or couple skating will be per- l
mitted.

These rules are set forth in order to prevent accidents

 

and to inculcate a sense of individual safety in all skatersJ .

The skate directors’ whistle warnings must be respectedl

The following will not be permitted: .1]
1. Cutting in and out in front of other skaters. l

the floor in a counter-clockwise direction. -‘

8. Excessive speed during “All Skate” event.

9. Whipping during “All Skate,” and also during special

10. Tunneling and submarining (racing turns), except
when a racing event is scheduled. .

The “all skate” signal is given during one of the roller

Strict skating rules and regulations must be followed.

Skate Repairs and Replacement

All skates needing repair are sent to Las Palmas Play-
ground, the repair and distributing headquarters for all sup-
plies connected with the roller skating program.

Publicity

When playgrounds schedule a roller skating session or
sessions, it should be immediately reported to the public
relations oHicer. Directors should also obtain publicity

through their local newspaper and placing the department
roller skating posters at various locations in the neighbor-
hood. These may be obtained through the district director,
Las Palmas Playground or skate headquarters, or the direc-
tor of special events.

After a year of close observation and operation of the
skating program, a backward glimpse reveals that we have
been indeed fortunate, in this short time, to see the gradual
development of a constructive and worthwhile activity. Few
changes have been necessary since its inception. Nearly
all skates have been replaced with offset type wheels, and
this has greatly reduced damage to” floors. We have' also
found that wooden wheels, being much lighter, are safer
and better for small youngsters. Therefore, wooden wheels
are gradually replacing fiber wheels in the small-size skates.

The program itself is, more and more, operating on a self-
sustaining basis. Private groups are organizing skating
parties for their own members, and this brings additional
revenue to the department. Many playgrounds schedule
family evening sessions.

Skating sessions are patterned after those of the commer-
cially operated rinks and the program includes grand
marches, couple and trio skating, reverse skating and all-
boy or all-girl skating. Simple elimination games which
do not require expert skating are also very popular.

Roller skating in Los Angeles today is not only a con-
crete sidewalk or driveway activity, but an indoor activity
in safe surroundings for people of all ages. I

The University of Illinois has been working closely with
the research committee of the Illinois Recreation Associa-
tion for several years in identifying and proposing problems
for research and study. The major purpose of these cooper-
ative arrangements is to gear graduate research to help solve
major recreation problems of the recreation practitioner
and simultaneously provide experience in research for those
pursuing advanced degrees in recreation at the university.

Problems are elicited from membership of the Illinois
Recreation Association, evaluated, rated in terms of priority
need, and then assigned to qualified investigators, if mutu-
ally acceptable to both the graduate student and the uni-
versity authorities.

Over sixty projects have already been suggested by as-
sociation members. More than ten of these studies have
been completed and include material on such matters as co-
operation with school districts, coordination of community
recreation services, volunteers, minority problems, financial
practices, nomenclature, fringe areas, p0pulation trends,
public relations, park-schools and public school camping.
Latest projects are a study of the backgrounds of recreation
personnel in Illinois, recently completed, and a plan for the
registration or certification of recreation personnel in Illi-
nois soon to be completed.

An even more intensive effort to secure cooperation be-
tween the Illinois Recreation Association and the University
of Illinois on recreation research projects will be made in
the future. As Russell Perry, president of the IRA, stated,
“Plans call for workshop meetings in which the committee
lists the relative importance of subjects, the study of which
will be an asset to Illinois recreation. Committee members,
representing various community sizes and organizational
structures, should be able to provide a wide variety of prob-
lems suitable to graduate study.”—CIIARLES K. BRIGHTBILL,
Professor 0/ Recreation, University of Illinois.

Fees and Charges in Little Rock

The Little Rock, Arkansas, Parks and Recreation De-
partment early in 1956 sent a questionnaire to some fifteen
park and recreation authorities in the large cities in the
Southwest and Middle South. The purpose of the survey
was to secure information as to fees at golf courses, swim-
ming pools. and museums, and to determine whether beer
was sold in the parks. A brief summary follows:

As for golf fees on weekdays, eight agencies charge less
than one dollar; five charge one dollar; and three charge
more than one tlollar. ()n weekends the rate is under one

dollar in two instances; one dollar in five; and more than
one dollar in eight.

Different fees are charged for adults and children at the
swimming pools. Four authorities report a charge of less
than thirty-five cents for adults; five report thirty-five cents,
and four more than thirty-five cents per swim. Four authori-
ties charge children less than fifteen cents; four of them
fifteen cents, and seven, more than this amount.

Beer is not sold at park stands in twelve cities; it is sold
by three authorities. Beer is not sold at eleven zoos, but is
sold at one. The sale of beer at golf courses is more wide-
spread although eight authorities do not permit it, six do.

Study of Group Camping Needs

A “Study of Group Camping Needs in Central Washing-
ton” * is a cooperative project of the National Park Service
and the School of Physical Education, Recreation,-and Ath-
letics of the State College of Washington. It'is primarily a
survey of existing camp facilities and programs in Central
Washington, the area which includes the new Columbia
Basin Recreation Project. With 98,165 people in 1950, the
p0pulation hasbeen eXpanding rapidly, so that a population
of 141,000 is anticipated by 1970.

The survey is probably the most intensive study of the
status and needs of camping in a given area made in recent
years. Agencies and organizations with camp programs or
with an interest in camping were interviewed and findings
recorded on extensive questionnaires. School children filled
out forms in classrooms under survey staff supervision.

The study attempts to determine the number of children
attending camps and the camps attended. It is interesting
to note that, of the forty-four camps attended by the chil-
dren in the study, twenty were church camps.

Statistics in the study are difficult to compare with those
of other studies because of the inclusion of very short-term
camps in the figures.

One purpose of the study is to determine whether present
camp facilities meet the demand and what extension of
these facilities will be needed in coming years. The vast
amount of information included in the tables gives a lucid
picture of the camping situation in the area. The conclu-
sions drawn may be pertinent to other areas of a similar
type but are probably not pertinent to sections of the United
States where the population is more stable and more rural in
character.—REYNOLD E. CARLSON, Assistant Professor of

The Story of’Maintenance . . . . .

Ways to make it easier, as told to the Great Lakes
Recreation Conference, Peoria, Illinois, 1956.

HE STORY of maintenance can be complex or simple, as

long or as short as your park and recreation system
wishes to make it. No matter how large or small the system,
there are certain basic elements to be observed if mainte-
nance is to be effective.

I.

Design and .Its Effect on Maintenance

The original design of park and recreational facilities and
areas largely determines ultimate maintenance procedure.
Maintenance problems may be many or relatively few, de-
pending upon how well the planner has thought out the
original design. Design shortcomings are not to be con-
fused with monetary deficiencies.

The very words, “parks and recreation,” denote people,
many pe0ple, using leisure-time areas and facilities day
after day, year after year. Designs must, therefore, embody
sturdy materials, ample space allotments and direct traffic
circulation. Such facilities need not be ugly; functional
structures can be very eye-appealing.

It is imperative that trained landscape architects, archi-
tects and engineers be retained to design and build all fa-
cilities and areas. The cost of such services, even for the
simplest structures, is low when compared to the ultimate
high maintenance costs resulting from poor design and
construction.

Far too many places for parks and recreation areas have
been developed without a clear understanding of the practi-
cal limitations to maintenance staffs taking over the proj-
ect. Also, the planner sometimes loses sight of the actual
needs of the people using the area, or the intended program
of the recreation supervisors. The planner must know what
recreational function is needed and intended from those in
charge of the general program. He must know whether it is
to be a program of camping, playfield, playground, picnic
facilities, or a combination of such needs. He must know
how the program is to be operated. In addition, the main-
tenance staff must be consulted repeatedly during the course
of planning as to the practicality of maintenance in light
of previous field experience.

A good park and recreation administrator will bring to-
gether design, program, and maintenance personnel, if
future maintenance is to be made easier. Over a period of
years our concept of design has changed. Think of the golf
course. We now mow roughs to speed up play and keep
people moving. Tees and banks of putting greens are de-
signed with gentle slopes to better facilitate mowing with
motor-driven equipment. Tees are spread out and flattened

to reduce excessive wear in one spot. Greens are no longer
tucked in pockets surrounded by shrubs and trees where
grass may be excessively attacked by fungus. The old con-
cave or “dished” design greens have been replaced by drain-
age SIOpes to the sides. Ornate bridges across ravines are
being replaced by culverts and earth fills. Through better
design, maintenance costs have been ,reduced, and beauty
has not been sacrificed.

One of the most exciting areas of modern design lies in
the elements of children’s playgrounds. Fine exploratory
work has been accomplished with sculptural land forms and
new varieties of playground equipment. These modern ads
ditions produce a strong environment of imaginative play.
There are “mountains” to climb, “tunnels” to explore, and
“boats”, “airplanes” and “horses” to ride. This new equip-
ment should eventually lead to lower maintenance and at the
same time exert a stronger infiuence on the imagination and
mental deve10pment of the young child.

Note contrast in equipment! Today,
hand labor, as shown here, is being

replaced more and more with effi-
cient, power maintenance machines.

The Peoria park system has just completed a new zoo.
To avoid maintenance headaches, the system employed an
outstanding local architect who constantly kept in touch with
the Peoria Zoo superintendent, as well as other noted zoo
directors throughout the nation. In addition, Peoria has its
own well-qualified landscape architect who designed the
area and coordinated the entire project. He also worked
closely with other members of the administrative staff as
to general program and available funds. Many costly main-
tenance errors were eliminated by this process. Past experi~
ence of the consultants showed that broad, direct walks were
a must; ample paving around exhibits was imperative.
Water outlets for flushing out cages provided with oversized
drains are time-savers. A well-designed kitchen with coolers
and freezers at a central location greatly reduces costs.
Tile, instead of concrete, cuts odors and aids in cleaning

441

cages. As a result of coordinated effort, with maintenance
men and operators, a satisfactory design has been achieved.

Personnel and Training for Maintenance

No matter how well designed the facilities and no matter
how carefully plans for maintenance are laid, maintenance
will break down if properly trained and enthusiastic per-
sonnel are not on the job.

In all instances, park and recreation departments should
do all within their power to get qualified personnel. Some-
times this is not possible, and help must be inexperienced.
\Vhether we secure trained or untrained personnel, in-serv-
ice training should still be carried on. Most park and recre-
ation departments fall short in this vital field. An alert park
system will carefully select and send men to VaIiOUS con-
ferences related to their obs. lf employees pick up a single
worthwhile idea at these conferences to better their main-
tenance program, the time is well spent.

An employee should, in all instances, be familiar with
the workings of the entire park and recreation department.
He should know its place in the community. He should,
further, realize the relation of his particular job to the
whole park organization. Sometimes no clear-cut defini-
tion of an employee’s job exists. This is especially confus-
ing to the employee and may create further confusion if
administrators or supervisors are hazy on job requirements.
To eliminate this, some park departments have established
a comprehensive job description and wage evaluation man-
ual. Each employee should receive a mimeographed form
describing his duties, the department head receiving a copy
of combined forms describing those under his authority.

Rules and Regulations

Maintenance cannot be effectively carried on without full
knowledge of the rules and regulations in force. To insure
such knowledge by each department, a carefully prepared
digest of rules and regulations of the park and recreation
system should be reviewed carefully during in-service train-
ing mssions, and be distributed among the personnel.

Equipment and Materials

it is obvious that much benefit can be derived by correct
use of materials. We should all strive for full mechaniza-
tion. l’roper purchasing methods pay big dividends. In-

ventory of all equipment and tools is a must, both as to
disposition and condition.

Organization of the Maintenance Program

We have spoken briefly of five main fields of coordinated
effort in the park and recreation administrative field: plan-
ning and construction of facilities, maintenance of facilities,
operation of program, financial control and legal control.
Sometimes operation and maintenance become entwined but
essentially they represent distinct fields of endeavor.

Too often maintenacc becomes a hit-or-miss phase of the
total park and recreation program. To insure that this is
not the case, we should give it a very prominent place in our
personnel organization: plan. There should be a direct line
of authority, and the maintenance pattern clearly defined

442

in the organization.
Our board of trustees has channeled all admlnlstratlve

efforts through a director of parks. The landscape architect
initiates the planning action arising from a known need, de-
termined by staff study or proven standard requirements.
The secretary-treasurer handles all financial matters and
the attorney advises the board as to aspects of legality. The
plan is referred back to the board for basic policy approval
and analysis. If the tentative plan meets approval it is

again brought back to the landscape architect for further,

planning and consultation with program and maintenance
personnel. The landscape architect then builds the structure
in close cooperation with other staff members. Now the
very important continual task of maintenance begins. The
recreation program may also begin, and it will function
smoothly if all departments have done their job correctly
and maintenance continues at a high level.

To insure that the maintenance program does continue at
a high level, the maintenance supervisor clearly outlines
the work which is coordinated with the activity program.
Once this schedule is laid out, individual plans of action
then must be made for each department. This planning must
be systematic from the top of the organization down to the
final output of work. Systematic plans involve stajjt and em-
ployee meetings, both regularly scheduled and special. A
very definite budget must be set up and, in most cases, will
strongly infiuence the maintenance plan. We can only main-
tain to the extent funds are available, and in this respect, it
is far better not to attempt certain parts of a maintenance
schedule than to do them poorly. Having determined the
extent of our maintenance program, we should then plan
to run it in the most efhcient manner possible.

lie-occurring maintenance work normally accomplished
at certain seasons should be carefully charted—especially
vital functions essential to the success of the particular
maintenance program in question. This establishes a list as
to relative importance of maintenance duties. For example,
a groundkeeper would benefit greatly in his day-to-day plans
by a chart of duties. Such general charts help the main-
tenance supervisor become more specific as to where the job
should be done. It will also aid in defining the time limita-
tions of seasonal work.

Seasonal charts and listings also will determine the type of
personnel needed. We are then able to decide definitely
who is to do the work, how many men are needed, and ap-
proximate time required. The nature of the maintenance
item will further indicate the tools and materials necessary
to carry out the job most efficiently.

A Playground

that Pleases

Children

Ralph H. Shaw and Edward C. Davenport

Yes, the summer playground season is over—“but we can dream, can’t we,
about next year’s playgrounds? And dreams have a way of coming true, if we
have time to work on them and bring them to life. So—this story of how a drab,
Cinderella playground became a bright, gay one, filled with happy youngsters is
not just a fairy tale. Perhaps your playgrounds need to be looked at from a
child’s point of view. Perhaps plans made this winter can turn them into beauty
spots next summer, and the youngsters in your town will throng to them. Beauty
is a sort of magic, you know.

IS YOUR playground attractive to chil-

dren ? The park and recreation com-
mission in San Mateo County, Califor-
nia, asked itself that question and re-
ceived a negative answer. After much
careful consideration on how to make
the playground at Flood Park, in Menlo
Park, attractive, the personnel decided
on a complete revamping—with the
idea that the playground was for the
children, and children only.

Bright colors, such as red, yellow
and blue, were to be used to distinguish
play apparatus and give the play area
life from a child’s point of View. Ordi-
nary play equipment such as swings,
slides, jungle-gyms and merry-go-
rounds were part of the equipment, but
apparently did not have enough appeal
for the three-to-fourteen age groups.

Trying to keep in mind what a child
would like to play with, we came up
with some ineXpensive but practical

ideas. A built-in regulation Ping-pong

' table in color, an octangular sandbox

painted in different colors, and three
cement culverts (four feet long and
three feet high), acquired through the
courtesy of a concrete company, were
added. The culverts were resurfaced
with cement, then sanded and polished
to a fine smooth finish. Each was
painted a different color and they were
set in Y formation, far enough apart
to prevent jumping from one to the
other. Tanbark, approximately nine
inches deep, was then spread around
them. A tetherball for the older chil-
dren was also installed. A drinking
fountain was put in, built to a child’s
height of twenty inches, and painted
red, yellow and blue. The fountain was
surrounded by a large mound of tan-
bark to assist going and coming from
the fountain. Three tables, approxi-
mately twelve feet long, with attached
side" and end benches were also in-
stalled, at a heightofor children. These
tables were each painted different col-
ors and are used for drawing and
games.

Probably the biggest addition, and

the most attractive one, is the octangu-
lar equipment hut. This was painted in
different colors to represent a carousel,
top fringe and all. On the four sides
are nursery rhyme characters. The hut
has a push-out half-door from which
athletic equipment and all types of
games and puzzles are issued, along
with crayons and funny books and
such. The hut and the playground are
supervised from 10:00 A.M. to 5:00
P.M. every day except Monday.

In trying out a cbmplete change-over
from drab, ordinary colors to bright
and attractive colors, it was felt that it
was important to give the children
something that is theirs, something they
can associate with all their 'dream world
thoughts.

Successful results are evident by
the tremendous increase in attendance
along with complete satisfaction to both
children and parents. This experiment
in color psychology has deepened the
children’s interest in the playground

and helped to prove the department’s
motto: Children Who Play Well To-

gether Become Adults Who Live Well
Together. I

as close to the original as possible. The
second time the play was presented, it
drew capacity houses every evening for
seven nights, with two performances
each night. Optional donation of a new
toy as the price of admission netted the

questions as, “Who’s the pretty lady,
Mama?” when they first saw Mary.
“0h! is that an angel? She looks like
a fairy Godmother! Can she really
fly?”

knowledge and understanding was
shock, until I realized what a wonder-

The House of the Lord Jesus

“Look, Mommie!” My four-year-
old pointed a chubby finger and shout-
ed, “There’s the house of the little Lord
Jesus!” She was pointing at a small
theatre, the Miles Playhouse, operated
by the recreation department of Santa
Monica, where, for the past few years,
the Wilcoxon Group Players have pre-
sented many successful productions.
She was speaking of the annual Nativity
play which has become a nationally
known event. My first instinct was to
laugh at her sweet candor, then a sober-
ing and inSpiring thought struck me.
If one baby felt this way, how many
other children felt the same?

Since the first presentation in 1952,
thousands of people have seen the play,
more than half of them children. To
how many of them, l wondered, did
this little theatre symbolize the \ativity
and everything they knew about Christ-
mas and the Savior's birth?

To hundreds of children in Southern
California. thc annual production,
based on the seven-hunt]rml-year-old

lull;

ful thing the theatre was giving these
children at Christmastime, and I blessed
their parents for bringing them. How
better could they learn and forever, re-
member the Christmas story than from
fine professional actors, superbly cos-
tumed, acting against the tranquil
beauty of ancient stained-glass win-
dows, on a beautifully lighted stage?
Here was visual education at its best!
And because the children had come to
a theatre to see a play, they reacted
more freely than they might have in
a solemn church atmosphere. They
laughed at the shepherds” antics, and
lived every scene to their fullest emo-
tional capacities, their eyes and ears
filled with beauty, great poetry and
heavenly choral music.

In December, when the curtains part
at Miles Playhouse, and the great bells
of York Cathedral peal out the glad
tidings, all the weeks of rehearsal and
production worries prove well worth-
while.——MRS. JOAN WILCOXON, Direc-

tor, Wilcoxon Group Players, Los

Phone Santa Program

The “‘Phone Santa” program in
Frankfort, Kentucky, is sponsored by
the Frankfort Playground and Recrea-
tion Board each Christmas season. It
is a cosponsored event in that the re-
tail merchants give us $150 to help
cover expenses. The original idea was
taken from RECREATION Magazine sev-
eral years ago and expanded. Many
children can’t write, but they can talk
well enough to tell Santa or Mrs. Santa
what they want for Christmas.

We have several phones put in with
special numbers and as each child
phones and tells what he wants, his
name, his age, parents’ names and a list
of his brothers and sisters are put on a
three-by-five card by whomever an-
swers the phone, Santa, Mrs. Santa or
the helpers. The card is used as a mail-
ing list for the merchants and a check-
list for the mailers of letters from Santa.

ing letter and a balloon from Santa,

A Christmas Creche

For about a week or ten days at
Christmas time Wilmington has, in a
prominent location at the edge of one
of its parks, a Christmas creche. The
l animals are live; the human figures
are mannequins borrowed from various
stores and properly costumed by volun-
teers.

Everything is donated, including la-
bor. The building is erected, taken
down and stored by a local building
contractor. The lighting has been par-
ticularly good as one of the experts in
the city volunteered his services. Not
one person who was asked to donate
labor or material has refused.

An endless number of people in the
community would have joined in had
there been opportunities; therefore, in
presenting the creche to the mayor of
the city, those who actually worked on
it wished to remain anonymous and
wanted it considered a contribution of
all citizens of all denominations and
faiths. People of every creed were en-
thusiastic about it. There was no evi-
dence of rowdiness, bad manners, or

Nnvvunvn 1 01:5

loud talking in its vicinity at any time.
Carols are sung around the creche each
day, either by choirs or groups of chil-
dren from various schools.

This endeavor may stimulate other
organizations throughout the country
to do likewise and, I hope, on a volun-
teer basis. There have been several
such installations in other cities; but,
so far as I know, ours is the only one
which has been done without cost.-—M.
DUPONT LEE, President, Board of Park

Commissioners, Wilmington, Delaware.

Something “Plus”

A surplus ammunition trailer and an
imaginative staff is helping the Louis-
ville, Kentucky, Department of Parks
and Recreation put increased emphasis
on the spiritual side of Christmas where
it means the most—with the children.

For six years the department has
built a Christmas Hoat on top of an
army-surplus ammunition trailer it had
purchased. The float was towed around
the city, stopping to visit schools, rec-
reation centers and orphanages.

Last year, without cutting out Santa
Claus with his near-mystic hold on chil-
dren’s hearts, department officials add-
ed something to help the children real-
ize the true spirit of Christmas. Using
the theme, “What Christmas Means To
Me,” recreation center leaders encour-
aged children in the centers to write
their true impressions of Christmas.

Principals of the schools to be visited
were asked if the subject might fit in as
an English class assignment, and many
adopted the idea. The entire program
was vigorously publicized, but no at-

community project. All labor and materials were donated, including
livestock. Mannequins were borrowed and costumed by volunteers.

tempt was made to force it upon any-
one. Officials wanted real thoughts
from the heart.

A Hoat featuring Santa’s North Pole
Post Ofiice was designed. It was con-
structed in the department shops, and
school visits were set up on a military
precision timetable. Thousands of pep-
permint sticks were purchased to be
given out to the younger children.

The float began its rounds two weeks
before Christmas with seasonal music
caroling from loudspeakers. At each
school, several hundred children rushed
out to see Santa and get a candystick.
Many had essays to deposit in Santa’s
North Pole Post Office.

Some of the letters were, of course,
of the “I want” type children have writ-
ten for generations. But the overwhelm-
ing majority showed that they knew
and appreciated the true meaning of
Christmas. Among them, there was this
letter from a second grader: “Dear
Santa Claus: Baby Jesus was born on
Christmas. We get some toys on Christ-
mas. Merry Christmas, Jesus. I love
you.” And a thoughtful six-grader
wrote: “Most of all I think of the little
children in Korea and other places that
have had war. I wish they could be as
happy at Christmas as we are in
America.”

Thousands of letters came in, and
Louisville oflicials were happy they
could help interpret the meaning of
Christmas without moralizing or throw-
ing a wet blanket over children’s tradi-
tional Christmas fun—JOHN MEEHAN,
Division of Recreation, Department of
Parks and Recreation, Louisville, Ken-

Cooperative
Ill-Service Training

 

Dick Palmer

How does the beginning recreation
leader know he’s out out for the work?
How does a recreation department an-
swer this question when it hires a be-
ginner? And last, how can a recreation
department get the best possible leaders
it needs to fill out its necessary comple-
ment of part-time, summer workers?

In Minneapolis, the park board’s rec-
reation department has made successful
steps toward answering these questions
and, in doing so, is helping to mold
the future recreation worker, better the
entire field of recreation, and save
money for the city taxpayer.

The answers came when the recrea-
tion department began working with
the University of Minnesota and Augs-
burg College, both in Minneapolis, in
connection with individual in-service
training programs for teaching and rec-
reation students. Karl Raymond, Min-
neapolis park recreation director from
1920 to 1954, initiated the first plan
with the university’s recreation division
in 1946. The college of education at the
university set Up a similar program in
1948. All the in-service training pro-
grams are now compulsory for recrea-
tion or education students.

The university’s recreation division
was set up in 1938 as part of the physi-
cal education department. The divi-
sion’s in-service training program, set
up at the same time, requires all stu-
dents to complete sixty hours per quar-
ter (about six hours per week) in some
practical recreation work during their

junior and senior years. In-service rec-
reation work is without pay and avail-
able to students in many different agen-
cies in public, semi-public, and private
classifications. Semi-public recreation
work includes church groups, YMCA’s
and related agencies.

Augsburg and the university’s college
of education require elementary educa-
tion students to take part in a student-
participation program during their un-
ior year. The program calls for twenty
hours of group leadership available
with twenty-seven different agencies
throughout the city. They include the
same agencies that work in cooperation
with the recreation division. Elemen-
tary education students must complete
two quarters of this work and Augsburg
students two semesters. The Minneapo-
lis Volunteer Service Bureau is set up
specifically to help place students in the
various agencies.

In all agencies, a supervisor is avail-
able to help the student in his work and
later evaluate that work on forms that
are returned to each school department.

Mr. Raymond noted the all-around
value of these two student participation
programs and introduced them into the
Minneapolis park system in 1946 when
the first community center districts
were set up in the city. There was a
need then for more qualified recreation
leaders in each district.

And how have these programs'an-
swered the all-important questions
asked at the beginning of this article?
The answers lie in the comments made
by administrators in both the park and
college recreation departments.

“It’s the acid test for the student,”
said Mrs. Alice Dietz, assistant director
of recreation for the park board. “The
student comes to us completely unaware
of what he must do. It helps him get
first hand information on recreation

work and lets him know whether he has
the ability and real desire to continue

in the field.

“A student not prepared for recrea-
tion work or not best suited for it, ruins
his own life and does harm to an entire
recreation program by sticking with his
job. The training program lets each
student make up his mind before he
leaves college.”

Advantages to the park board come
when one considers the thousands of
people who want to use recreation facil-
ities and the comparatively limited rec-
reation budget. “Students not only help
themselves,” said Mrs. Dietz, “but they
help the taxpayer because in-service
time is at the student’s expense.”

Student elementary teachers are
given the following purpose for the
student-participation programs in a syl-
labus issued by the two colleges: The
aim of the program is “to grasp the
significance of working with children
for' their personality development as
preparation for a pupil-centered ap-
proach to teaching rather than a sub-
ject-centered approach . . . to give the
student the opportunity to discover if
he really does like youth and children
and if he is really interested in the so-
cial service aspects of teaching.”

H. R. Giles, associate professor at
the university, heads the recreation di-
vision in-service program and sums it
Up by saying, “It’s a proving ground
for students. It gives them a chance
to find themselves and what type of
recreation work they want to enter.”

Mr. Giles, former Kentucky state rec-
reation director in 1946-47, is at pres-
ent conducting a job analysis evalua-
tion of the program as his doctor’s
thesis. His interviews with fifty students
find a large majority saying the two-
year field experience requirementis by
far the most valuable recreation course
the university has to offer; and his in-
terviews with students and recreation
agencies alike prove the program has
helped them to begin more .quickly after

RECREATION

graduation, and offered an economic
advantage for each agency.

Many students who have proven ex-
ceptional during their in-service train-
ing with the park board are hired as
paid part-time help during the busy
summer months. This gives them an
opportunity to learn and to profit dur-
‘ing Vacation months; while the park
board’s advantage is that of obtaining
high caliber and interested assistance.

Summing up the training programs
from an all-around viewpoint, Russell
H. Johnson, Minneapolis recreation di-
rector, states: “The benefits are two-
fold: to the students, a projection into
their future; to the recreation division,
the service and youthful enthusiasm of
students eager and well-trained.”

Self -Development

W. C. Sutherland

It is an unhappy day in anyone’s life
when he fails to find sincere satisfac-
tion in doing useful things. Superseding
all ambitions and motivations is the sat-
isfaction of work well done.

Most of us have to work whether we
want to or not; but there is added pre-
mium in taking pride in one’s work.
Doing more than just getting by, and
improving over past performance,
strengthens us for the next assignment
and makes work a game——vital and ex-
citing. Substandard performance is im-
printed on the personality and is de-
moralizing. We should do the best we
can, for this is poor enough—all of us
fall short of perfection at best.

In doing our best and being our best
we get better; otherwise we slip back-
ward. Putting out top performance as-
sures the kind of satisfaction that comes
only with useful work well and willingly
done. He who fails to learn and grow
as much as he should and holds back
his best efforts only cheats himself.

In addition to controlled, organized
and well—planned self-development ac-
tivities, successful people make the most
of odd moments, the in-between times
that are so easily wasted. These are the
waits between appointments, between
assignments, between projects, or the

intermissions between jobs. It is the
natural thing to grow, for we are made
for movement and to face life on our
feet, moving, working, thinking, grow-
ing, solving problems, meeting obliga-
tions with conviction, courage and

faith.

The Biblical story of creation pro-
claims that man shall have dominion
over all the earth, and that he shall
replenish and subdue it. This imposes
an obligation to act upon our environ-
ment and leaves no ustification for suc-
cumbing to circumstance or situation.
We should not be content to remain as
we are; life is an unfolding process and
we are expected to play a full role and
live up to our greatest potential. 0b-
stacles are to be conquered, capacities
expanded, skills and abilities improved,
knowledge increased, and the art of
leadership developed if we are to dis-
tinguish ourselves. The greatest domin-
ion is over one’s self.

Read and study, and you will know
more; care more, and you will serve
better; serve better, and you will enjoy
your oh and receive new benefits from

life. I

Miss Mississippi
is Recreation Major

 

Miss Mississippi and canine friend.

Annette Tisdale, a recreation major
in her sophomore year at Mississippi
Southern College, was selected “Miss
Mississippi" in the 1956 “Miss Amer-
icia” contest. A Student Associate Mem-
ber of NRA, Miss Tisdale in answer to
the question, “Why did you choose to
major in recreation?” gave this an-
swer:

“To me, the recreation curriculum is
one of the most fascinating and satis-
fying courses a college student can fol-
low. I chose a major in recreation with
a minor in psychology, planning to
enter the field of recreation with an em-
pliasis in social work. I have already
found a great deal of pleasure in help-
ing others enjoy leisure-time activities.

“The recreation curriculum at Mis-
sisippi Southern College is fun, inter-
esting. challenging and exciting. It aids
in developing a well-rounded person-
ality, maturity, and self-confidence, in
addition to providing the essential pro-

fessional skills for recreation leader-
ship.”

Pennsylvania Graduate Program

A graduate training program, pro-
viding lull scholarship plus mainte-
nance, is being offered for 1956-57 in
selected fields by the Pennsylvania
State Department of Welfare. Recrea-
tion graduates interested in careers in
hospital or institutional recreation may
qualify if tlwv wish to do graduate work
in social group Work, occupational
therapy. or certain other fields.

“15‘ l

Assistance during graduate study in-
cludes payment of tuition up to $750
per year at an accredited professional
school in the state. In addition, the stu-
dent is paid a biweekly stipend of 3584
during the first year and $112.50 dur-
ing the second. Summer employment
is also available.

Students participating in this plan
for professional training are expected
to accept regular employment by the
department of welfare, one year for
each academic year provided.

Inquiries should be addressed to
Helen McManus, Department of Wel-
fare, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Off-Campus Summer Field Work

This summer saw the beginning of a
six-credit off-campus field-work pro-
gram for University of Illinois recrea-
tion majors. The practicum requires
three hundred and twenty hours, or
eight weeks’ work as a minimum.

Supervision of the field-work student
is provided by qualified agency super-
visors and by the university supervisor
of recreation field work. Cooperating
agency field-work supervisors receive
regular university appointments to the
position and are eligible for certain
staff privileges.

Enrollment this summer included
nine men and fourteen women. They
were placed in public and voluntary
community recreation agencies, a hos-
pital, and institutions. Preliminary
staff evaluation indicates the new sum-
mer program may be expected to

strengthen materially” the university
recreation curriculum, according to

Virginia Frye, instructor in recreation.

Junior Colleire Students Tour

Students from Vallejo Junior Col-
lege, (.ahfornia, were taken on an all-

day trip last spring to campuses of tWt
state colleges. The twenty-one student:
were investigating the recreation cur
riculum as a possible major or minor

At San Francisco State College
Polly Glyer, acting head of the recrea
tion curriculum, told the students abou
collegiate requirements, transfer 0
credits, opportunities in the field, an(
potential salary conditions. Other fac
ulty members and student recreatiOi
majors assisted in the presentation. Th4
students visited some recreation classe:
to obtain additional background.

Dr. Mary Wylie and Buford Busl
gave the students similar indoctrinatioi
at San Jose State College, the secom
stop. The tour was arranged and con
ducted by Keith A. Macdonald, execu
tive director of the Greater Vallejo Rec
reation District, as an experiment. Mr
Macdonald is a member of the MRI1
National Advisory Committee on Re
cruitment, Training, and Placement 0
Recreation Personnel.

“Every superintendent of recreatim
in the United States has a responsibilitj
to recruit top students into the chal
lenging and fascinating field of recrea
tion” writes Mr. Macdonald. “Shoult
only a minority of the students wh<
took this trip decide on recreation as :
minor, it is a wonderful start. We hop:
to repeat the tour next year and includ:
the campuses at Sacramento State ant
College of Pacific, both of which giv:
fine recreation courses.”

: Mr. Macdonald recommends starting
to interest students in recreation ca
reers at the high school level rathe'
than after the student has entered col
lege. This is echoed by Ivan W. Hill
director of physical education and rec
reation in Richmond, California, Wht
said, after hearing of the junior collegu
tour: “That is an excellent idea and '
am going to immediately arrange ti;
take students from our high school lead
ership classes on a college visitation.”

Study of Local Expenses

versity of Wisconsin has just announcec
completion of a study of local govern
ment expenditures for recreation for the

fiscal year 1952.

Records of more than 2,300 Wiscon
sin towns, villages, cities, counties, ant
school districts were reviewed, and ex
penditures for recreation were reportec
by 586.

tion purposes, as $1.49. A secona

RECREATIO1

Q‘W‘faé Mew“

This month, Hospital Capsules was
written by Elizabeth P. Ridgway, 0.T.R.,
occupational therapy consultant for the
Bureau of Mental Health, Department

i of Welfare, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania has created 277 jobs
for recreation personnel in its state
mental hospitals. How did this come
about? Because of :

' Fifty thousand patients in the state
mental hospitals who need recreation,
not only as a human‘right, but as a
means of recovery.

' An occupational therapist, employed
in the department of welfare, who was
convinced of the vital necessity of- such
activities, who knew state hospital con-
ditions and personnel needed.

' A departmental committee on patient
activity which studied the potential of
therapeutically oriented patient activi-
ties, as well as the problems which in-
terfere with their effective use, and
made personnel recommendations.

' A citizen mental health organization
which has developed public opinion to
the point where it is impolitic to oppose
mental health apprOpriations.

' A secretary of welfare who is dedi-
cated to the improvement of mental hos-
pitals and is an effective politician; a
governor with the courage to stake his
political life on the necessity of ade-
quate mental health appropriations;
and a legislature with the statesmanship
to place mental health above politics.

The patients are, of course, the vital
reason for the program. Without the
awareness that life can be a rewarding
experience, no patient will make the
tremendous effort necessary to recov-
ery. The central question in developing

. the treatment program was: “What ac-

in order to grow?” And recreation
always was part of the answer.

The occupational therapist acted on
the principle that any activity was
beneficial if in the hands of a mature
person with a capacity for establishing

tivity experiences does this patient need
patient relationships. 'Suitable staff

ve10ped in accordance with their skills.
The result was a program predomi-
nantly recreational, and its success
proved the vital place of recreation in
any program of therapeutic activities in
a psychiatric setting. As the program
grew, it was decided that it could not be
administered successfully without divi-
sion heads—separate persons to head
the- recreation, occupational therapy,
industry, and volunteer services. At the
same time, it was essential these serv-
ices be integrated.

and activity department heads, has been

data, considered policies, listened to re-
ports, investigated what has been done
in other states; it helped spread con-
cepts and supported new policies.
Within the department of welfare
and the bureau of mental health, the
climate has been conducive to the de-
velopment of patient-centered activity
policies. In the process of policy de-
ve10pment one of the most difficult de-
cisions concerned preparation required
of recreation personnel. While much
can be accomplished by lay personnel
(in fact their psychiatric naivete has
positive value at some points), there are
important values in having psychiatric-
ally trained recreation workers at key
points. This was provided by the crea-
tion of the position of activity therapist
with a specialty in recreation, music,
art, and so on. A board of review has
been set to consider criteria and evalu-

ate the preparation of each candidate.
A knowledge of psychodynamics and of
the differential therapeutics of activities
will be expected of persons qualifying
for these positions. The recreation
leader position (activity instructor),
however, requires recreation skills only.
There will always be a place for work-
ers in this category; the specially quali-
fied therapist should be reserved for spe-

cial treatment situations or supervision.

The most serious compromise made
in classification was in not requiring
the recreation supervisor to qualify as a
recreation therapist. This compromise
was made realistically in order to obtain
the very real values offered by experi-
enced hospital recreation workers.

Dual preparation requirements (clin-
ical as well as professional recreation
subjects) create many problems in the
educational area. An" educational pro-
cedure pr0posed and discussed in psy-
chiatric circles is the establishment of
a core curriculum consisting of clinical
subjects to be the same for all activities
personnel, with specialized electives in
art, music, social recreation, crafts, and
so on. 'This would take the place of the
present curriculum in occupational
therapy and music therapy and would
produce persons qualified for staff posi-
tions in all activity therapies. Addi-
tional preparation would be indicated
for supervisory positions in any spe-
cialty or for co-ordinators.

.IRE CREATION

 

Utopia 1976

Morris l.. Ernst. Rinehart & Com-

any, 232 Madison Avenue, New York
16. Pp. 305. $3.50.

Those of us in the recreation move-

ent who are striving to prepare Amer-
ca for a leisure-time program that will
-nrich life can be heartened by this pic-
ure of the world twenty years hence.

Mr. Ernst’s utopia is not just the
' roduct of imagination but is a peri-
- opic view of the full, rich life poten-
ially ours, if we just move ahead on
resent lines and help individuals make
he most of the leisure our developing
esources of energy are now making
o ssible.

He gives the scientific, economic, in-
ustrial, political, and social basis for
he leisure that is to be for all. Those
f us who are professionally responsible
or helping pe0ple realize this practical
nd eminent status should be thrilled
nd inspirited by the message in this
ook.

Mr. Ernst points out that the family,
ome, school, and the mental and phy-
ical health of people must be enriched
n spiritual terms or the hope of more
eisure and greater income lose their
lamor. Our people are shifting from
n.audience society to a participating
ociety. There will be a shift of inter-
- ts “from elected officials to millions
f people united in a common purpose
or the development of better parks,
laygrounds, sewer systems, and art
alleries in their cities.” The vast addi-
ional leisure time will make possible
he contribution of hours and energy

ormerly supplied by a few lucky rich
or the benefit of the community.

“Men and women follow only those
ith hope. We all seek direction mark-
rs of optimism. Our spiritual road

, ap will carry the direction pointers:

976—This Way—Energy, Leisure,
ull Rich Life.” Here is a fresh new
harter for the recreation authorities
’0 the world.

Mr. Ernst’s findings and facts should
2I known and considered by everyone.
l or recreation leaders they are a must.

T. E. Rivers, director general of the

Covering the Leisure-time Field

Puppets and Plays—
A Creative Approach

Mariorie Batchelder and Virginia

lee Comer. Harper & Brothers, 49 East
33rd Street, New York l6. Pp. 24l , ill.
$4.00.

Here it is, at last—the most useful
book on the creative approach to pup-
pets and puppet plays. Perhaps the fact
that the authors are a puppet specialist
and a drama specialist has a great deal
to do with so suCcessful an interpreta-
tion of puppetry.

The philosophy that “a puppet is not
a toy, a doll, or an example of handi-
craft; it is nothing until it becomes an
actor” shows the difference betwen this
and the many attractive but too simpli-
fied books now available.

This book does not iust dwell on the
making of puppets. Instead, it shows
in every chapter how puppetry can be
used in the many and varied approaches
to creative self-expression for all age
groups. In fact, it overflows into all
phases of creative activity. The chapter
on “A Creative Approach to Drama”
should be studied by all drama leaders.
Its warning is well-stated: “The fact
that puppetry, except for the youngest
child, includes some sort of presenta-
tion means that it can be either a self-
conscious, imitative, formal experience
or it can be a creative experience, full
of spontaneity with the presentation an
incidental and natural outcome of the
whole process.”

The problem is stated simply, and the
book itself provides the solution in its
wise, clear techniques, detailed meth-
ads, and its constant stating of its fun-
damental philosophy, so true in all crea-
tive activities, that “the most important
values are those which accrue through
the process . . . . values which are im-
portant to individual personality
growth and group interaction.”

This book is'more than a book on
puppetry: it is a book on the techniques
of leadership, and its application is as
valuable to arts, crafts, drama, dance
and other creative activities as it is to
puppetry.

Recommend it to your staff. (In fact,
insist that they read it!) Read it your-

self. Discuss it in staff meetings. Use
it in workshops. Keep it near at hand.
Use its excellent bibliography which in-
cludes creative art, drama, and so on.
It is an important contribution to the
recreation profession from its preface
to its last page. You’ll underline sen-
tences on every page, and when you’re
finished reading it, you’ll feel exhila-
rated and refreshed. Don’t miss it.
Books like this don’t come often!—

Activities in Ceramics

Vernon D. Seeley and Robert l..
Thompson. McKnight & McKnight Pub-
lishing Company, l09-l ll West Mar-
ket Street, Bloomington, Illinois. Pp.
82. Paper $1.25.

If I were starting a ceramics class, or
were a member of a ceramics class, I’d
buy this book. It’s simple, concise,
clear, and makes good sense. As a craft
instructor, I’d find good use for the
techniques and methods outlined and
illustrated. As a beginner, I’d quickly
gain confidence from the step-by-step
proiects.

There are many good books written
on ceramics, but for general, immediate
use I’d take this one. It explains the
various methods—free-form, pressing,
built-up (both slab and coil), slip cast-
ing, throwing, glazing, and so on—in
such a practical, of-course-you-can-do-
it way that enthusiasm and interest are
sure to follow. Because all the tech-
niques have actually been used with
adult and high-school classes and have
been through the mill of actual usage,
they have the ring of truth and accu-
racy. It’s an excellent book for hobby-
ist or craftsman.

Who’s It?

Patricia Evans. The Porpoise Book-
shOp, 308 Clement Street, San Fran-
cisco 18. Pp. 3l. $.25.

Remember the reviews we’ve given
of Jump Rope Rhymes, Hopscotch, and
lacks? Here’s the latest of these de-
lightful booklets—all about counting
out rhymes. Personally, we regard
these as collectors’ items—delightful
accounts of traditional game folkways
that should be preserved.

Now, for $1.00, you can get all four
of these booklets in a special gift en-
velope or have it sent anywhere in the
world. The set would make a very nice
present for any recreation leader or
anyone interested in folklore.

Did You Feed My Cow?

Margaret Taylor. Thomas Y. Crow-

It is encouraging to see children’s
rhymes, rhythms, chants and singing
games collected and preserved in‘ their
authentic, picturesque forms, fresh
from city streets and country roads.
This collection is beautifully printed,
with gay illustrations by Paul Galdone.

Recreation leaders would do well to
learn a good repertory of such material
for use on occasions when the groups
are small, or when the weather is hot
or rainy. We wish, however, that tunes
had been included in the “Play Party”
section, to make the action clearer.

Collecting material on jump-rope
rhymes, bounce-ball rhythms, clapping
response games and doorstep chants
would be a wonderful hobby for anyone
in recreation. This book should be
added to any such collection.

MAGIC FOR ALL

Fun-Time Magic by Victor Havel.
Childrens Press, Jackson Boulevard
and Racine Avenue, Chicago 7. Un-
paged. $1.50.

This clever book will make a magi-
cian of anyone! It’s designed for chil-
dren—but what a hero you’ll be on the
playground next summer if you per-
form these tricks and then teach them!
Delightful illustrations, clear direc-
tions, tricks simple but effective! Excel-
lent for junior leaders, and for use with
the seven- to ten-year-olds. They’ll be

of good use to you on those rainy or
hot days!

Teach Yourself Magic by J. Elsden
Tuffs. Emerson Books, 251 West 19th
Street, New York 11. Pp. 182. $2.50.

This may be just the thing for that

group of boys who want to have a club,
but have no special project in mind.
With a good leader, these magic tricks

' can he learned and practiced, then put

into magic “shows”-——the leader learn-

ing along with the boys. Good chapter
on entertaining children.

A GREAT BOOKS PROGRAM

Johnny is back in his mr‘r'crowded
u-lnml. and still the argunmnt rages

whether he can or can’t read. ls anyone
asking questions about what he should
read and why? Why do we send Johnny
to school in the first place?

Because discussions on the great
issues in education appeal to groups of
adults, The Great Books Foundation, a
non-profit organization, 37 South Wa-
bash Avenue, Chicago 3, has prepared
a three-volume set of readings designed
for such purposes.

Beginning with selections from the
recent White House Conference on
Education, the readings include mate-
rial by Bertrand Russell, Plato, JohnI
Dewey, Herbert Spencer, John Hersey
and others. The plan is for participants
to read a selection each week in prepa-;
ration for the ten-week discussion pro--
gram.

Twenty-three members of the founda-
tion’s staff in all parts of the country
are organizing and training leaders for
this new program. For further informa-
tion, write the foundation.
