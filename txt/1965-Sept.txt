Hohner instruments
are more fun than Chinese Checkers

Everyone loves to play Hohner instruments like the harmonica and the Melodica. They’re fun!
Because anybody can pick them up and make real music right away. What’s more, the harmonica
and Melodica are quality designed, precision instruments. It’s a chance to really learn an
instrument. Without the restrictions of the printed music page! Turn all that energy and
interest into Hohner music! See the Hohner harmonica and Melodica at the 47th National
Recreation Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Booth 100, October 3rd through 7th.

. the National Conference of State Parks; and the
ican Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.
dedicated persons hammered out the essential, final
s in a memorable two-day meeting at the Hotel Ameri-
in New York City this warm weekend, August 13-14,
I ke this merger possible. They now bestow upon it
final blessing. The National Recreation and Park As-

ours of exhausting work. May its future accomplish-
make them justly proud! All you in the fields of
tion and parks, who have looked to them in hope can
ook to them in gratitude.

On Education, Citizen Action,
Federal-State-Local Partnerships.
Presented by Mrs. Arthur E. Whine-
more: From the eleven recommenda-
tions of these three panels, based on
the idea of a creative partnership on

all levels of government, private organ-

izations, institutions and enterprises.
are the following, to:

0 Establish a strong focal point for

coordination and leadership of the na-
tion-wide effort to secure environment-

al quality by broadening the purposes
and membership of the Recreation Ad-

visory Council.

0 Establish a citizen advisory board,
appointed by the President, to assist
him in carrying forward the nation—
wide effort, to call problems to the at-
tention of the council, and to press for
continued improvement in federal pro--
grams.

0 Establish a Curriculum Study Com-
mittee on Conservation, Redevelop-
ment, and Natural Beauty, composed of
leading scholars and educators in the
field.

0 Provide federal grants to help es-
tablish natural areas in connection with
educational institutions.

0 Form at once a National Citizens’
Committee for a Beautiful America,
privately financed, to stimulate and co-
ordinate citizen efforts.

Excerpts from the President’s
Reply to the Delegates:

“Natural beauty is mOre than a rich
source of pleasure and recreation. It
shapes our values. It molds our atti-
tudes. It feeds our spirit, and it helps
to make us the kind of men and women
we finally become. And the kind of
men that we finally become in turn
makes this great nation. . . .

“Experts, officials and concerned cit-
zens . . . have come to Washington
to try to help us make this a better and
a more beautiful landg. . . There is
nothing that is more important.”

HE 1965 Educational Press Association award for “distin-
guished performance in a feature article” was presented to
Recreation on June 28 for the story “Heyday in the Park” by Eric
Lindsay in the October 1964 issue. Mr. Lindsay, who is public in-

formation ofiicer for the Board of Parks .and Public Recreation in
Vancouver, British Columbia, also received an award certificate.

. State bond issues. A number of

states have passed or are considering
major recreation bond issues. These
include:

Connecticut. State bond issues author-
ized by the 1965 Legislature included
$2,000,000 for open-space develop-

ment.

New York. The state legislature ap-
proved a $200,000,000 bond issue to
eXpand outdoor recreation facilities.
This is subject to approval by the voters
in November 1966. The new program
is an extension of one started in 1960
with a $75,000,000 bond issue, to which
another $25,000,000 was added in
1962.

Rhode Island. In a special statewide
election, voters approved the establish-
ment of a Rhode Island Recreational
Building Authority empowered to guar-
antee up to a total of $5,000,000 in
mortgage loans for construction of rec-
reation and tourist facilities. A five-
member authority will be appointed by
the governor with the consent of the
state senate.

THINGS YOU SHOULD . KNOW.

) RETIREMENT, PREPARATION. Aside
from a few pre-retirement projects con-
ducted by community agencies, the
s'ponsOrs Of retirement preparation pro-
grams have been companies or_unions.
Many companies have been reluctant to
do more than the minimum in this area,
either because they believe they would
be interfering with what they consider
essentially a personal problem, or are
afraid of being accused of paternalism,
or are reluctant to incur the additional
expense and trouble that instituting a
valid program would involve, consider-
ing pension benefits a sufficient dis-
charge of theifresponsibility to there-
tiring employee. ”

.This does “not mean that all. com-

322

panics and unions fail to understand the
importance of providing meaningful
preparation for retirement. Following
are two instances of programs, each
among the best of its type, currently
being carried on. Both are on a volun-
tary basis. '

The first program, sponsored by a
company, is an example of the use of a
series of interviews with an employe
over a relatively long period of time be-
fore his retirement. The second, a union
project, consists Of formal classes one
day or evening a week for a period of
eight weeks.

So carefully was the course planned
that the New York State School of In-
dustrial and Labor Relations at Cornell
University sees in this approach a guide
for other labor and management groups
interested in instituting a meaningful
pre-retirement program.

A CREATIVE APPROACH
TO PLA‘YSPACES FOR
TODAY’S CHILDREN

by DAVID AARON
with BONNIE P. WINAWER

David Aaron has achieved a
national reputation among
forward-looking recreation de-
partments for creating new
types of playground equipment
which stimulate a child’s imag—

ination and develop his knowl-
edge and skills.

 Play, David Aaron says, is a

5-3 child’s work. In CHILD’S PLAY
he tells why he regards most
of today’s playgrounds as
wastelands of boredom and
breeders of danger. Out of his
broad experience he then dem~
onstrates what sort of play
areas, public and private, are
needed to provide truly crea-
tive play for both normal and
handicapped children.

Informal and anecdotal,
CHILD’S PLAY will prove im-
mensely helpful to municipal
and school playground direc-
tors — in fact, to everyone
concerned with children’s wel-
fare and development through
recreation.

families, groups, neighborhoods and
communities. In recognition of their
professional training and this accumu-

lated experience, social workers are be-.-
ing called upon increasingly to partici-.

pate in the war on poverty, particu-
larly in the organization of community
action programs in which the poor
themselves must give leadership. As
social workers, we expect to give a good
account of ourselves in such efforts and
to lead the way in making adaptations
and innovations in existing services as
they are needed.”

Along with Mr. Gustafson, two other
new ofiicers of the national association
are: First Vice-President, Helen E.

47th NATIONAL RECREATION CONGRESS;

 

HIGHLIGHTS
of the

Leamington Hotel, Minneapolis, October 3-8

GENERAL SESSIONS

Two outstanding personalities will
address the Congress general sessions:

Charles (Bud) Wilkinson and Dr. Reu-
ben K. Youngdahl. Mr. Wilkinson,
president of the Lifetime Sports Foun-
dation in Washington, D.C., is former
head football coach and director of ath-
letics at the University of Oklahoma.
Dr. Youngdahl, pastor of the Mt. Olivet
Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, is a

prominent author, orator, and sports-
man.

FEDERAL AID SESSIONS

U.S. Government oflicials will be
present to explain the application of
many important pieces of important leg-
islation to the park and recreation field.
Some of the programs represented i11-
clude the Office of Economic Opportun-
ity, Bureau of Outdoor Recreation,
Housing and Home Financing Agency,
Army Corps of Engineers, the White
House Conference on Natural Beauty,
and General Services Administration.

SPECIAL INSTITUTES
In addition to the annual National
Recreation Association National Insti-
tute in Recreation Administration, there
will be two special three-day institutes
for military and hospital personnel,

directed by Dr. H. Clifton Hutchins and
Fred Humphrey, respectively.

PIC-A-TOURS
The Pic-A-Tours, which were so pop-
ular at last year’s Congress, will be of-
fered again this year. Several different
short tours will be offered during Con-
gress Week so delegates may make a
selection. These tours will visit differ-

ent facilities where operations will be
explained.

WIVES’ PROGRAM

Activities planned for delegates” wives
include a visit to the famous Betty
Crocker kitchens at General Mills, a
trip to the American Swedish Institute,
a planetarium show, crafts projects,

and learn-as-you-play table games.

SPECIAL EVENTS

Delegates will have the opportunity
to see a performance of The Cherry 0r-
chard at the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre.
The theater itself is well worth a visit.
Its plan grew out of Mr. Guthrie’s ex-
perience with the Shakespeare Theatre
in Stratford, Ontario. Design of seat-
ing, stage, and other features is asym-
metrical. It uses a modification of the
extended forestage (also called the
open stage). Delegates planning com-
munity theaters or cultural centers
should find the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre
a valuable experience. (Tickets, $3.50
each, are available from Charlotte Fos-
burg, 3251/3 City Hall, Minneapolis 15.
Deadline, September 25.)

Delegates will also be treated to a
free performance of the Lake Harriet
Pops Orchestra, a 43-piece ensemble.
which will be accompanied by thirty-
three singing voices.

Instead of the usual Congress ball-
quet and speaker, delegates will enjoy
an informal smorgasbord followed by
dancing and entertainment. The popu-
lar Schiek’s Singing Sextet will provide
an hour-long special performance.

POST-CONGRESS TRIP

A special three-day tour along the
North Shore (Northern Minnesota) is
available to delegates at a nominal cost.

and this helps you to keep control. You
will also be in a position to suggest
points overlooked by the audience, giv-
ing an opportunity for well-rounded
discussion and consideration.

Have facts at hand, not to trot out
gratuitously but to fill gaps. Make sure
that there is someone present who has
detailed knowledge about the project
under consideration or experience in
the course proposed. Obtain whatever
pertinent booklets are available, not
with the idea of reading them to the
meeting but so as to have authoritative
material at hand to answer questions
and spark discussion.

D 0 NOT rely upon your native intelli-

gence to provide you with spur-
of-the-moment comments and debate-
starters. As Nathan Sheppard wrote in
a long-forgotten handbook for public
speakers: “The best improvisations are
improvised beforehand.”

Always keep the members of your au-
dience in mind. What sort of people
are you to preside over? Some will
turn up at meetings with only existen-
tial knowledge of the problem on the
agenda: they know there is a problem.
Others will bring essential knowledge:
they know there is a problem, they
know its nature, and they have exam-
ined into it.

To put it in its shortest form, it is
the duty of the chairman to plan and
prepare necessary business, present it
to the meeting, and carry out the poli-
cies decided upon.

Keep the minds of your audience
open and running, not stagnant and
idling. Try to avoid wrong turns and
dctours and suppress the tendency some
people show toward dead-end debates.

You can accomplish these desirable
purposes very neatly by rephrasing
statements that might be misunder-
stood, sifting out the irrelevant com-
ment, and summing up the points which
mark progress.

dent, though it is not your place to talk
often or at length. Your job is to get
the ideas of others out for an airing.

distance. You can ruin a meeting by
consulting your secretary or rifling
through your portfolio of papers while
a speaker is addressing you.

Here, in a sentence, is your duty as
chairman: Listen carefully to what is
being said, seize illuminating sugges-
tions and point them up, combine sim-
ilar ideas expressed differently, recon-
eile divergent opinions, clarify state-
ments when they may be misunder-
stood, and sum up step by step to mark
progress toward a solution.

SHOULD 11' HAPPEN—and it will hap-

pen in the best circles—that several
matters suddenly appear before the
chair under the umbrella of the one
being discussed, do not hesitate to call
a halt to the proceedings while you dis-
entangle them.

You must not allow informality to
obscure the importance of what is be-
ing done. Your usefulness depends upon
your authority as director of the meet-
ing. You have been given that power
for a purpose—the purpose of directing

The proposed new standards omit specifics for totlots,
playgrounds, and playfields, but include them in neighbor-
hood and district parks.

A second challenge of urbanization is social planning for
a life-enhancing environment which is conducive to creative
living. There must be close cooperation between recreation
and health-and-welfare councils, civic groups, government
agencies, and private institutions. An extremely important
aspect is joint planning by public departments and institu-
tions for community integration of the aged, mentally ill,
retarded, job corps employed, the delinquent. There also
must be a concern for planning which fosters better mental
and physical health and social relationships. Recreation
has an important role in the community’s problems of health
and sanitation, delinquency and violence, disaffection and
education. Organized recreation must be concerned with the
conditions of and for all people not only including all races,
creeds, and colors, but all ages, and all physical and mental
conditions. '

The third aspect of the challenge of urbanization is ade-
quate administrative structure. No longer can individual
incorporated cities be administered without consideration
of their metropolitan area or of the urban complex of which
they are a part. There must be an administrative structure
which will adequately provide for a recreation program for
the entire urban complex and with the concept of active and
passive recreation. Open spaces of all types and facilities
must be part of the plan: The structure must provide also
for cooperative administration of parks and other recre-
ation areas and of school grounds and facilities. Whereas
historically recreation literature has recommended a sepa-
rate recreation department and has discussed recreation
administration in terms of whether it is a separate depart-
ment, a combined park and recreation department, under
parks, or under a school board, the import of administration
must now be on how recreation administration operates
under various types of government structures and legally
possible relationships.

THE PROBLEM of an increasing population is not primarily
in the numbers, but in an understanding of the specific
characteristics of the population, such as the working pat-
tern, family composition, age, economic and education level.
What does it mean to programing that the average age of
women when they bear their last child is twenty-six or that
the average length of work for women is thirty-three to
thirty-five years during their lifetime, or that there is ex-
tensive unemployment of single girls not in school between
ages sixteen to twenty-one? These influencing factors and
many, many more must be understood by recreators. But,
once this understanding is gained, it is clear that the chal-
lenge of population to recreation is what happens to these
millions. With the tendency to evaluate success of an activity
on the basis of attendance, increased population makes it
easy to draw a false conclusion of effectiveness. There must
be new concepts of programing to assure meaningful rec-
reation experiences. The traditional approach to a good
program does not reflect new knowledges and understand-
ings about people or the society in which they live.
Programing must truly be total community recreation.

“Organized recreation,” whether a public recreation.

identify its role, its unique function. No longer can 6
evaluate proper scope of program by checking if there!
program activities for each age level and in each prog’
field. All leisure-time agencies must complement each ob
in an unified total community recreation program.
Selection of activities must be made upon the val
contribution each makes towards meeting the needs 0Q!
participants. Program balance should mean not so
sports activities and crafts activities and drama activ V
but activities which contribute to each of the needs of it

pression, achievement, and grouped according to beha‘:
domains, such as the cognitive (intellectual, knowl '
skills and abilities), affective (interests, appreciations,le‘
tudes, values), and psychomotor (manipulative and Cd“
dinative physical skills and abilities). - l
Evaluative techniques must begin to measure effect":
outcomes of recreation activity upon the individual and‘
effectiveness of various methods and procedures.

RECREATORS have not even begun to reach into the del
of the importance of understanding the meanin
discretionary time—many call it leisure, but the termf:
ogy is not what is important, but the challenges it presei'
Not only must the amount of time individuals have be In
ognized but also when this time is available. But more.
portant is the understanding of “forced” in contrastI
“voluntary” discretionary time. Institutionalized pe.
have much forced discretionary time—the aged in nur‘
and retirement homes, and persons in prisons, juvenil
tention homes, mental institutions, et cetera. Also, the
employed handicapped have enforced discretionary til
which recreation can materially effect through socializ
and rehabilitation. And, in considering voluntary di
tionary time, one must not forget the moonlighters,
working mothers, the professional or executive, the tee
who does'not take a ob. Just because there is time a
able does not mean that it will be consumed in recre
activity. " i

The recreator must recognize the effect of various leis.
activities on individuals, such as extended television, can.

Fourteen-mile special bike-way through East Detroit has been
set aside for hostelers as part 0/ the pilot program.

around in the United States for thirty
years, this will be the first time that city
recreation departments would be sys-
tematically promoting and offering the
activity as an integral part of their pro-
grams.

Hosteling fits in naturally into any
community-serving program. Basically,
it is all the things that people who are
young in spirit like to do—biking, hik-
ing, skiing, horseback riding, and ca-
noeing in the great outdoors. It is or-

Louis lit/aid

ganized educational and recreational
travel, whether it be for a weekend or a
long vacation trip. Travellers stay at
low-cost overnight accommodations
called hostels located .in scenic, historic,
and cultural areas. Here, they meet hos-
telers from other parts of the country
and world and cooperatively share in
meal preparation, cleaning up, folk-
singing, games, and exchange ideas and
experiences. In fact, hosteling is a com-
posite of all the ranges of programs and
activities that recreators wish to make
available in their communities.

All three pilot projects were launched
last April and will last for a year. Dur-

    

 

ing this time, hostel clubs are being set
up in each city for youth in Grades
Seven through Twelve. Parents are be-
ing encouragedéto join and serve as
leaders for hosteling trips. It is esti-
mated that during the course of the year
some thousand persons will be drawn
into hosteling programs for the first
time. Special bike-way paths are being
erected in each city (East Detroit al-
ready has 105 signs erected on a four-
teen-mile bike way through the city),
leaders trained, lessons provided in hos-
teling techniques, and wide community-
based activities organized. Further-
more, plans are underaway to take
groups from the pilot areas on hosteling
trips to Europe next year.

The programs have been welcomed
with great enthusiasm by the mayors
and public oliicials of the three selected
pilot areas. Mayor Edward J. Bonior,
East Detroit, stated: “The benefits our
youth can receive from participation
in the AYH concept will be evidenced in
years to come."The emphasis placed on
physical, spiritual and social develop-
ment through the services of the AYH.
will bear fruit to our community, state
and nation in molding our ‘Citizens
and Leaders of Toniorrow.’ ”

The pioneering spirit shown by these
recreation directors in incorporating
hosteling in their programs is sure to
attract the attention of other cities.
Municipal recreation department pro-
fessionals will be able to hear a report
on these pilot ventures at the 47th
National Recreation Congress in Octo-
her and AYH will stand ready to assist
them in developing similar programs. #

Swimming Hall of Fame

THE Swimming Hall of Fame, incor-
porated as a nonprofit educational
corporation chartered under Florida
law with a board of nineteen directors
and committees of two hundred swim-
ming people, represents all elements in-
terested in advancing aquatic educa-
tion and skills. President of the cor-
poration is Dr. James Counsilman of
Indiana University, 1964 U.S. Olympic
swimming coach. Vice-presidents in-
clude many-time Olympic coach J. H.
Kiphuth, former Olympic managers
Edward T. Kennedy, Ben York, and ex-
Olympic swimmer John H. Higgins of
Navy. Executive director is Buck Daw-
son, a swimming writer and publicist.
Recreation, high school, college, club,
AAU, YMCA, Red Cross, NCAA, the
coaching associations, and virtually all
swimming regulatory agencies and pub-
lic interest groups are represented on
the board of directors.

The purpose of the new Hall of Fame
is to provide an official shrine to per-
petuate the memory of famous swim-
mers, honor, and preserve the great
moments in swimming, educate the
public on the importance of swimming,
and to provide a gathering place for

research materials on swimming and a '~

rallying place for swimming groups
whether active or reminiscent. It is to
be a living Hall of Fame with moving
exhibits, changing programs, and a
variety of services to the swimming
public. The term “swimming” is to be
interpreted in its broad sense to include
the human propulsion water sports such
as swimming, diving, water polo, and
synchronized swimming; water safety
programs; aquatic art; and any other
new horizons that swimming people can
help promote for the public welfare.
This is to include swimming as a safety
factor through every-child-a-swimmer
educational programs as a fitness pro-
motion factor and as a positive sports
deterrent to delinquency.

THE CREATIVE APPROACH
To Parks And Recreation: ’

William Penn Mott, Jr.

LACK OF CREATIVITY can cost you
money, community respect, and
efliciency. Encouraging imaginative
positive thinking ,in every park and
recreation department should be natu-
ral, causing an overflow of new ideas

and a desire to excel. From my oh-

 

servation, the opposite is true. The cli-
mate for dynamic creative thinking, must be established by
'the administratorf‘lf he, is timid and afraid to accept and
try new ideas,‘even the most: imaginative person soon be-
comes frustrated and discoyraged—band a “what’s-the-use”
attitude prevails. 

MR. MOTT is general manager of the East Bay Regional Park
District, Oakland, California. This material was presented
at the 18th Annual Great Lakes Park Training Institute.

’1,

Every park and recreation
department should be a
fountainhead of new ideas in
community living. In Miami,
Florida, new Elizabeth Vir-
rick Park in Coconut Grove
was designed as town square
and a total community rec-
reation center for all age
levels. Free-form. flower-like
structures nestled among live
oak trees provide shelters for
varied recreation activities.

ing in your department? Take an inventory. What have you
done this past year that has given your department a lift,
developed civic approbation, set your spine to tingling?

I am not talking about spending a lot of money. That is
not required. If there is empathy between your department
and the community through creative thinking, you will get
the money. On thé’ California State Seal is the motto “Give
me men to match my mountains.” That is another way of
saying think big, think creatively. Only big ideas attract
big men, but to start the process you must start with simple
developments.

Here are some little things that you can instigate to start
your department along the exciting, creative path of action
and leadership.

0 Permit free and open discussion of all problems.

0 Give department heads equal opportunity to review all
plans.

0 Encourage the flow of magazines. periodicals, books
through all departments. Read.

0 Encourage employes and provide incentives and oppor-
tunities for them to receive continuing education. Think.
0 Hold regular staH meetings and general meetings of all
employes. Communicate.

0 Encourage ideas and act upon them giving due Credit,
or, if rejected, give reason.

0 Encourageinquisitiveness.

0 Create an atmosphere of Urgency and Action.

0 Allow employes the freedom of judgment and permit
“calculated risk” decisions.

0 Make the public interest your interest.

0 Do not allow private, special, or political interests to
provide the enzymes for your decision-making process.

0 Review your operations. Are they up-to-date or are you
just satisfied?

When you start asking questions instead of stopping ques-
tions, and when thinking, reading, and communicating takes
the place of regimentation, directives, and “that’s-the-way-
we’ve-always-done it” attitude, your department will be en-
ergized into positive creative thinking, ideas will How, things
will happen, and the community’s consciousness will rally
to your support in a most rewarding way.

RECREATION SUPERVISION CRISIS

 

Joseph M. Caverly

INCE World War II there has been an acute shortage of
S trained recreation leaders. The rapid growth of lei-

sure-time programs across the United States and Can-
ada has caused a great demand for professional administra-
tors to direct various recreation programs.

The National Recreation Association Associate Newslet-
ter, October 1964, raised some vital questions: “Why aren’t
more college students choosing careers in recreation?” It
stated that the forty-nine colleges and universities that took
part in the study planned to graduate 677 recreation majors
last year, with 188 student candidates for graduate degrees:
“The average number of recreation majors graduating each
year has not fluctuated more than one student since 1956.”
This startling figure is an indication of a real crisis in
professionally trained administrative recreation personnel;
however, there is even a greater shortage in line leadership
for general recreation supervision for playgrounds, recrea-
tion centers, and other programs.

To meet the supervision crisis in Rochester, New York,
the newly created two-year Monroe Community College was
called upon to assist the city and surrounding communities
with the problem. A Recreation Supervision Advisory Com-
mittee was appointed to study the situation, and a survey of
the surrounding area was conducted, with a startling result.
The need for recreation supervision in the area for public,
hospital, private agency, and industrial programs was far
greater than anyone had anticipated. Projecting the need
to 1970, the area would require 542 recreation trained peo-
ple, which is approximately the same as the total national
graduates. As a rule, graduates from the field of recreation
have been oriented and are more interested in the adminis-
trative positions than the line supervision positions. The
committee felt strongly that there was a need for far more

Indians than chiefs, and it was evident that it was nece.
to train recreation supervisors on a local level.

A plan was drawn up and submitted to Monroe Co
nity College and later adopted by the trustees of the
University as an accredited two-year course with a degr
recreation supervision. The course was clearly ident
as a training program in recreation, not as an administr
course.

In 1963, the first year of the curriculum, forty stu
enrolled, of which seventeen were from city recreation
teen from Community College and eight from social a
cies. Last year there was a new enrollment of forty-two
dents. The course number is limited and all students
interviewed and selected.

leadership ability who otherwise would never have entered
the field of recreation. Some of these young, enthusiastic
students are now considering matriculating to a four-year
recreation administration course.

The committee stresses recruitment of leadership at the
grassroots community level. It is now in the process of
holding a community-wide recreation recruitment day to
enlighten the students of the curriculum and potential in the
recreation field. It is also bringing together the guidance
counselors from the surrounding twenty high schools for
the same purpose.

Last summer every recreation student from Monroe Com-
munity College had a position in the recreation field. The
city is utilizing a number of the students in a part-time
capacity while they are training at school. Many of these
students will progress in recreation supervision and some
will advance into administrative capacity, which will help
to fill an important leadership gap.

The course is directed by an able teacher, George C.
Monagan, head of the Physical Education Department, who
is ably assisted by six qualified faculty members, who are
covering the course with great interest and enthusiasm. The
program is not a panacea and was not designed to meet the
needs of the four-year training course in any way, but rather
to supplement it and to meet the need for the many thou-
sands of leaders we must have to operate our vast expanding
facilities and programs.

If this country is going to catch up with the leadership
gap, we must take action now to overcome our obstacles.

' AT THE CROSSROADS

 

These objectives are being accomplished through class-
room lectures, seminars, and projects; fieldtrips and field-
work; voluntary involvement in campus activities: written
and oral assignments; and activity-skill labs.

The first graduates of the diploma course have pioneered
a comparatively “different” type of university course. Their
training has frequently taken them out of traditional class-
room lecture periods to:

0 Take field trips, almost every week, to see special facili-
ties or programs.

0 Experience on-the-job training for periods varying be-
tween two days and two weeks.

0 Study and survey a specific community near Guelph.
0 Enjoy concentrated study in three different residential
settings.

0 Do the research required for special assignments in their
home communities.

0 Participate in conferences, professional meetings, special
training courses, and seminar presentations.

0 Hear and present symposiums.

0 Use discussion as a means of acquiring knowledge and
understanding.

The complete results of this training program will not

be known until these graduates are placed, and the effective-
ness of their k iowledge, skills, and methods can be measured

on the job.
\\ here may they be placed? Naturally, the greatest num-
her will find work in municipal recreation. Public recrea-

tion is the most rapidly expanding area of employment and
will continue to grow for some time.

Those in charge of the ill and handicapped in hospitals
and specialized schools are just beginning to realize the
value of recreation as a means of enriching the lives of
patients and helping them to achieve social adjustment.
Some students in Recreation ’65 have already had excel-
lent periods of practical training in both provincial and
private hospitals. It is hoped this will help to open many
more jobs throughout the province.

Private or voluntary agencies—especially those serving
youth—will require program specialists and facility oper-
ators in increasing numbers. It is hoped that a broad pro-
gram of recreation activities will be used in the rehabilita-
tion of those within provincial training schools and reform
institutions. Diploma graduates should be able to serve
these agencies well.

Industrial recreation—programs sponsored either by
management or employes—has produced a few openings
in Ontario. Commercial recreation will continue to grow
as pay-as-you-play facilities become more numerous. Per-

haps the armed services will look more favorably uponl
use of civilian recreationists now that trained persq
is available.

All of these positions are within the reach of di“
graduates. However, the objective for the course at (3‘
will not be reached until the one-year course for u
sity graduates has become a reality. Four candidat

Are we sending graduates into the field unprepared?

Professional
Preparation:

THE INTERN
PROGRAM

Robert F. Toalson

ARE WE sending recreation gradu-
ates into the field unprepared?
Granted, today’s graduates have a good
academic background, but are they pre-
pared to become administrators after
graduation? Are they ready to cope
with the day-to-day problems that will
confront them?

We, as a profession, are falling far short in the practical

 

background and training we are making available to these
graduates and should require them to have. Certainly each
student is required to have field-work experience before
graduation, and much of this is good. However, take a
good look at many of these assignments. The fieldworker
is assigned to a playground or center for a period of four to
ten weeks as a leader, in most cases to perform a prescribed
routine. After the student’s fieldwork is completed we pro-
fessionals call him in for a fifteen-minute chat, tell him how
great recreation is, hand him some mimeographed material,
and send him on his way. This is how we in the field help
prepare our students.

What about other professions? Let us look at three: Doc-
tors must go through a year internship and several years
residency before they undertake a practice. Lawyers start
as clerks and junior partners before they handle the big
cases. School teachers must have a semester or more of
practice teaching.

Why not a training program in recreation? Such pro-
grams do exist under the sponsorship of the National Rec-
reation Association. They are the internship programs in
Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Oak Park, Illinois. The first
two programs are of a year’s duration and the Oak Park
program is two years. To enter one of these programs, a
recreation graduate must be accepted by the National Rec-
reation Association and the local department. Upon com-

‘ Park has two staff members who served internships

hip. let’s ask them what they think:

tunity to continue my educational training and combine
it with an on the job training situation.”

Barbara Depp, intern, Milwaukee: “My previous experi-
ence in the field of recreation had been only summer and
volunteer work, I felt that I needed the experience and back-
ground information provided by an internship before taking
on supervisory responsibilities.”

Bill Depp, intern, Milwaukee: “I wanted to acquire addi-
tional leadership skills and abilities as well as gain needed
practical experience. I also hoped to learn program possi-
bilities from the broad scope of the Milwaukee recreation
and adult education program.”

Sandra Kelso, intern, Oak Park: “I felt a certain amount
of grooming of talent and academic training necessary to
begin development and refining of administrative and lead-
erships skills under professional guidance, rather than being
hired under the pretense of being a ‘professional.’ By going
directly in the field, I also felt that I might not get the variety
of experiences which would come under an intern program.”

What was or has been, to date, your most valuable
experience in the intern program?

Bruce Bille: “My most valuable experience to date as an
intern was to organize a community-wide special event
(Auto Dealers Model Racing Car Gran Prix) in cooperation
with another organization in the community.”

Barbara Depp: “The portion of my assignment which
was to a low socio-economic area where different ethnic
groups were interacting in sharing of program and facilities
was a very valuable experience. In this situation, minor
evidences of progress were greatly rewarding.”

Bill Depp: “The opportunity to meet and consult with staff
members and various other agency personnel was of vital
significance to me as an intern. These meetings and confer-
ences helped me to gain new insight into the field of rec-
reation, form some basic concepts and principles which
would serve as guidelines, and discover what processes are
required of a recreation professional in his planning for
community well-being.”

Sandra Kelso: “Of the numerous experiences available
through an internship the most significant have been those
opportunities to work with community organizations in
community planning and problem-solving (Community
Welfare Council, Community Chest, League of Women
Voters, village government) .”

I would recommend to all graduating reereators that they
not take an administrative job immediately after gradua-
tion but participate in an internship if possible. The learn—
ing experience will be very valuable and will pay many
dividends in the future. I would also urge other executives
to undertake an intern program in their departments. #

SHARING

SERVICES

Community nursing homes join forces
to provide long-needed
creative activities

Anne Smutny
ROFESSIONAL recreation programs are becoming an in-
P tegral part of larger nursing homes, which now em-
ploy their own full-time workers. However, what can
be done to help the many smaller institutions within a com-
munity, that cannot afford to employ a full-time worker, to
give their patients this same kind of ongoing recreation
service?

Several years ago the Middlesex County Tuberculosis and
Health League, an affiliate of the New Jersey Tuberculosis
and Health Association, and the National Tuberculosis As-
sociation, found that the emphasis of work in tuberculosis
and other respiratory diseases was shifting primarily from
young people to those older patients suffering from chronic
diseases. An intensive educational campaign among pro-
fessional groups as well as the general public was held to
arouse interest in the community, as elsewhere, in senior
citizens and their needs. Lectures on nutrition, housing, and
medical care were held. Through this work, the league dis-
covered that in the nursing homes throughout the county,
the outstanding lack found everywhere was suitable recrea-
tion activity to fill the many hours after a patient has been
fed and medically cared for.

Since the league is an autonomous unit, entitled to carry
on health programs and related projects on its own, its board
of directors undertook to procure funds from the New Jer-
sey Division on Aging and the Board of Freeholders, as
well as the institutions involved. Then the league initiated
a pilot project of creative recreation within Middlesex
County. This program, designed on a three-year basis, has
since been extended to five years. Its purpose is to show
the value of a professionally directed recreation program,
coordinated in six individual institutions within the county,
each having differing bed capacities and sponsoring aus-

These institutions are spread geographically from o
of the county to the other.

The project is now two and  half years old and i a

aim is to get the patients to participate actively the
in various recreation activities, rather than be just
onlookers.

The staff consists of two specialists, one in arts and
the other in music, plus the coordinator of activities.

specialties to the needs of handicapped patients. Th

closely with them on administrative details, such as visiting,
and all nursing routines. It is only with their cooperation
that recreation activities can be set up.

Next, there must be adequate space, either a dining room,
living room or dayroom, where groups of patients may
gather for activities. A piano, portable organ, or other sim-
ilar instrument is an important piece of program equipment.

The wide variety of physical handicaps plus those of see-
ing and hearing must be considered in planning activities
for aged and chronically ill patients. Many factors must
be taken into account as they have such a great diversity
of needs and abilities. Mental abilities range from the com-
pletely alert to the very confused. Some patients have short
attention spans and limited ability to concentrate.

In the light of these problems, recreation must attempt to
interest all these categories, and yet not have too many ac-
tivities going on simultaneously which can become much too
confusing. Activities must be simple but never childish.
They must be geared to meet the social, psychological, and
physical needs of all the patients.

Obtaining faithful volunteers who will come regularly
without'prodding, and encouraging community participa-
tion in such a program demands a great deal of time. The
result of volunteers working in such a program is greater
community acceptance and understanding of the role a
nursing home plays in the community, and the attitude to-
ward nursing homes changes from despair to hope.

HE PROGRAM is getting some amazing results. The pa-
tients are most responsive and are waiting at each
place on the appointed day and hour for the program to be-
gin. A woman at Roosevelt Hospital came to several sessions
a week, although there was only one for her ward; another
woman would not participate in the program until there was
a fuss made over her birthday. There are many stories of
triumph over terrific handicaps. Patients often comment,
“I went to bed thinking of what we would do in recreatiOn
tomorrow”; “I heard music, I think 1 was singing"; “Where
in the world do you find so many pretty projects?” And
after a rhythm session, “My arthritic hands hurt, but it hurts
so good!”

There is no final ending to this story, as the program is
always growing and eXpanding. The value of creative ac-
tivity is generally recognized, and the worthwhile use of
leisure time as essential to a child’s growing up. The league
recognizes they are equally essential for the older person,
for no matter how old we become, we never lose our desire
for the dignity that comes through purposeful activity. Pro-
viding our senior citizens with food, drugs, and rocking
chairs is not meeting their social and emotional needs, and
needs as human beings. We have added years to their life,
now let’s add life to their years. . . . #

ARTS €62? CRAFTS CORNER
And Put It in the Oven for Johnny and Me

Jean Wolcott

The responsibility of the arts-and-crafts specialist in
stimulating imaginations and guiding the creative process
into a conscious and visable form can be easily thwarted
by not being able to find new and exciting mediums and

projects. And finding projects that can fit all age groups is
doubly difficult.

Granules — Glohs — Goop

RANULES and globs are plastic pellets which fuse to-
G gether in an ordinary oven, electric fry pan or portable
electric oven and take on the shape of any metal mold they
are baked in (cake pans, muffin tins, pie tins, aluminum
foil plates, et cetera). Granules are smaller in size than
globs and melt at 350°F. Globs will melt at 200°F. Coop
is liquid polyester resin which hardens without heat, just
by adding a catalyst. It is used for preserving delicate dried
flowers, leaves, grasses, ferns, seaweed, et cetera. ( A word
of caution regarding resins: work out-of-doors or in well-
ventilated room with a fan going. Not recommended for
projects with small Tchildren.)

Natural materials and scrap materials can be embedded
in just granules or globs alone, depending on the desired
results or effects. Baking granules a quarter inch deep in a
pan for twenty minutes at 350°F will result in a bubbly
stage. Granules are fused and each one assumes a rounded
surface. Baked for thirty minutes they will assume a ripple
stage resembling Venetian glass and they are quite shatter
resistant. Baked for forty-five minutes they are glassy.
Globs take on a glossy bubble look in just ten minutes. They
melt down smooth in about twenty minutes at 250°F. They
will stick readily to a prebaked slab of granules so that
using them for three dimensional effects is most rewarding.

Third, any person who willfully and
for profit infringes any copyright, or
who knowingly and willfully aids or
abets such infringement, is deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon
conviction, is punishable by imprison-
ment for up to one year, or by fine of
not less than 3100, nor more than
$1,000, or both, in the discretion of the

court. .

There are two types of copyright
infringement:

One type, plagiarism, occurs where
the infringer attempts to pass off an-
other person’s work as his own. The
infringer incorporates all or portions
of another’s work into his own work
without the originator’s permission.

Another occurs when the infringer
physically copies the work of another
person either for his own use and bene-
fit or for the use and benefit of others,
but does not try to pass off the work as
his own. It is this second form of in-
fringement which concerns us here.

One factor, not present fifteen years
ago, results in a “Yes” answer to the
question, “Have you infringed a copy-
right recently?” The factor: revolution
in reprography.

As a word in English, reprography is
quite new. It does not even appear in
the Third Edition of Webster’s Inter-
national Dictionary published in 1961.
The term apparently originated in Hol-
land, perhaps fifteen years ago, and
rose to international recognition with
its inclusion in the title of The Inter-
national Congress for Reprography,

DIGEST

held in Cologne, Germany, October
1963.

Various reproduction systems have
been considered as included within the
term reprography. These include blue-
print and diazo systems, electrophotog-
raphy including Xerography and the
zinc oxide-coated sheet system, diffu-
sion transfer systems, and thermogra-
phic systems.

We can define those aspects of repro-
graphy concerning us here as a simple
process for copying or reproducing
documents not requiring a darkroom
technique or complicated manipula-
tion.

Before the advent of the convenient
copy machines, there was little appre.
hension on the part of authors and pub-
lishers concerning the ability of indi-
viduals, libraries, or business enter-
prises to reproduce all or portions of
a printed book or periodical. But the
emergence of reprography has brought
about an imbalance in this situation.

ODAY, an estimated 250,000 con-

venience copy machines are in use
in the United States. A short fifteen

years ago there were very few offices.
libraries, or laboratories that could
economically reproduce portions of a
book or periodical. This revolution in
reprography can be visualized when one

realizes that Xerox Corporation’s an-
nual sales rose from $32,000,000 in

1959 to $250,000,000 in 1964. This re-

prography has made it possible for you.
each time you step up to a copy machine

353

to make a copy. to be a potential copy-
right infringer. In fact, reprography
machines might be considered an at-
tractive invitation to copyright infringe-
ment. The specific problem involves the
competing concepts of copyright prop-
erty rights on the one hand and the
desire for the uninhibited rapid dis-
semination of information on the other
hand.

We are concerned with whose rights
are paramount, those of the copyright
owner or those of the ones desiring to
copy his work. We are also concerned
with how the best interests of science
and humanity in general can be fos-
tered. Can this be accomplished best
by allowing unlimited freedom to copy
works of others, or by rigidly uphold-
ing the copyright proprietor’s property
right, or by some middle ground?

Those advocating giving full scope
and protection to copyright property
rights, point out first, the copyright
concept is firmly entrenched in our na-
tional life; second, the United States
was among the pioneers of modern
patent laws and c0pyright concepts and
this, in no small measure, has helped
the United States achieve the position
of being the world’s foremost power
with the highest standard of living any
country has yet achieved.

THE patent and COpyright systems
are important features in our in-
centive economy. To build and main-
tain a strong nation requires incentive
sufficient to cause our people to expend
time, effort, and energy in progressive
pursuits. Advocates of reducing copy-
right protection argue that modern
times require information be readily
accessible and transmittable by modern
means and this right to copy is what
will make for progress and is para-
mount. It is also argued that the copy-
right is not an incentive in the fields
of science, where most articles are not
written with a View to making money.
The copyright law of the US today
is essentially the Copyright Act of 1909
and, except for minor revisions, we are
operating under a 55-year-old copyright
statute. The 1909 copyright act indi-
cates that COpyright registration may
be obtained for (a) books, directories
and compilations,  periodicals in-
cluding newspapers (0) drawings, d)
photographs, and f e) maps.

334

The copyright law says that the own- ner without his consent. Though te -l

er of a copyright “shall have the exclu-
sive right to print, reprint, publish,
copy, and vend the copyrighted work.”
This exclusive right holds for twenty-
eight years and may be renewed for
twenty-eight years. Copyright is secured
by publication of the work with the
notice of copyright, as provided in the
act, and may then be registered. The
only substantive test is that the work be
an original work in the sense of not
having been copied from another. Both
civil remedies and criminal penalties
are provided for copyright infringe-
ment.

Notwithstanding the fact that copy-
rights are provided for in the Constitu-
tion and that there have been federal
copyright laws since 1790, many areas
of the copyright law are still unsealed.
The copyright law of 1909 gives the
owner the exclusive right to print or
make copies of his work without excep-
tion. This is an absolute right or so it
would appear by reading the act. AD-
pearances, however, are sometimes de-
ceiving. Such is the case here. The
federal courts have recognized Con-
gress’ right to grant copyrights and to
protect copyright property rights. but
the courts have nevertheless placed re-
strictions on the extent and scope of the
copyright.

Although copyright owners have cer-
tain exclusive rights to print, reprint,
publish, copy, and vend the work, the
public otherwise can “use” the work".
The extent to which the public may use
the work has resulted in conflict. In our
situation “use” can mean physical copy-
ing, although use actually has a broad-
er connotation.

The courts, attempting to resolve this
conflict, have introduced a rule of rea-
son, the Fair Use Doctrine. Where the
copying is considered a fair use the
courts will not find copyright infringe-
ment.

The US. copyright laws have never
mentioned fair use so that there is no
statutory guide to its meaning; the
only guide is the history of prior court
decisions. At any rate, fair use is one
of the major defenses against charges
of infringement of a copyright.

One federa1 court has defined fair
use “as a privilege in others than the
owner of a copyright to use the copy-
righted material in a reasonable man-

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
   
    
  
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  

fl

cally an infringement of copyrig
is allowed by law on the ground
the appropriation is reasonable an
tomary. Whether or not the use

1

fair use is a matter of fact in eac .
ticular case.”

MONC THE USES sometimes prot

by the Fair Use Doctrine are:

0 First, incidental use — portio
copyrighted material for illustrati
background purposes in an entirel
ferent and noncompeting work.
0 Second, a review or criticism
work may quote extensively for ill
tion and comment.

The absence of litigation may b
cause it is difficult to police this
of situation, and the wide spread
photoduplication has only recentl
come important.

The court cases would seem to
cate that there are a number of ele
which bear heavily on whether a
copying or duplication — wou
considered within the Fair Use
trine. Mr. Justice Story of the
States Supreme Court stated th
factors involved in whether a us
fair use or not are: “The objects -

resently, two bills before the Con-
could become a new copyright
2 The Senate bill, introduced on
20, 1964, including a section re-
°ng to fair use, would provide that,
ithstanding the rights given to the
yright owner, “the fair use of a
yrighted work to the extent reason-
necessary or incidental to a legiti-
purpose such as criticism, com-
~ , news reporting, teaching, scholar-

EMBER, 1965

ship or research is not an infringement
of copyright.

“In determining whether the use
made of a work in any particular case
is a fair use, the factors to be considered
shall include: (1) the purpose and
character of the use, (2) the nature of
the copyrighted work, (3) the amount
and substantiality of the portion used
in relation to the copyrighted work as
a whole, and (4) the efieet of the use
upon the potential market for or value
of the copyrighted work.”

This bill, while it uses the term fair
use and indicates the nature of factors
to be considered, does not define fair
use. The bill does appear, however, to
open the door wider for copying under
the Fair Use Doctrine, and has further
alarmed the publishing industry.

There are apparently no court deci-
sions to date dealing specifically with
photocopying of copyrighted works
either by libraries or others, but, in
1937, an informal “gentlemen’s agree-
ment” was entered into between various
publisher groups and library and scien-
tific groups. This informal agreement
hasn’t the force of law because it is
between private parties but ‘is a state-
ment of principle accepted by the signa-
tories.

The agreement indicates that a li-
hrary, museum, or similar institution
may make and deliver a single photo-
graphic reproduction of a copyrighted
work or part thereof to a scholar, who
represents in writing that he desires
such reproduction in lieu of loan of
such publication from the library, and
that he will use it solely for the purpose
of research. However, it is also pro-
vided that the person receiving the
reproduction must be given notice in
writing by the library that he is not
exempt from liability to the copyright
pr0prietor for any infringement of
copyright by misuse of the reproduc-
tion constituting an infringement under
the Copyright Law. Further. the repro-
duction must he made and furnished
by the library without profit to itself.
The gentlemen’s agreement further pur-
ports to relieve the library from liability
for infringement, but this would appar-
ently not be effective against a copy-
right owner.

It should he noted that as indicated
in many court cases, the mere printing
or copying of a copyrighted work with-

out profit or sale still constitutes an
infringement. Further, it is clearly es-

tablished in the court cases that, “One
who prints an infringing work is an
infringer. And where a party causes or
procures an independent contractor to
print or copy the work, such party will
be equally liable with the independent
contractor as a joint tortfeasor.”

In 1941, a “Reproduction of Mate-
rials Code” ad0pted by the American
Library Association stated: “The final
determination as to whether any act of
copying is a fair use rests with the
court.” The main portion of the code
follows the gentlemen’s agreement.

ONE SOLUTION for the publishing in-
dustry: supply reprints of articles

in periodicals or portions of a book at
a cost per copy below the per copy of
the copy machines. With the present
copy-machine cost, the publisher could
also make a profit on the c0pies. The
publishers, however, would have to
maintain a return-mail service to com-
pete with the time factor on copy ma-
chines. Postcards such as are used in
periodicals with respect to advertising
literature could be placed in the peri-
odicals for this purpose.

A second possibility could be a roy-
alty fee system for copying. This could
probably be particularly successful on
a per c0py basis as far as copying in
or by public libraries is concerned.

A third possibility, which in its na-
ture is destructive rather than construc-
tive, would be for periodicals to spread.
say, a three-page article over perhaps
nine pages by printing one column of
several different articles on a page. At
a cost of five cents a COpy, a three-page
article would cost 8.15 to reproduce
but the same article spread over nine
pages might cost 3.45 to reproduce, thus
making the cost factor more critical. I
would suspect, however, that this would
only serve to increase the consumption
of reproduction paper and would not
increase the publisher’s circulation very
much.

The ingenuity of man knowing no
bounds, various other alternatives will
certainly be tried. This interplay in
years ahead should be interesting to

watch. #

0 THE “MOLE” (No, it isn’t a dance!) An inexpensive tool
for installing Hexible or semi-flexible tubing, piping, or cable
as deep as seven inches underground without disturbing
surface turf is the result of eight years of study and field
testing. It is said to be ideal for fast and easy, one-man
installation of underground sprinkling systems, gas lines for
yard lights and other purposes, and telephone and electrical
cables.

Called the Mole, the attachment (for sod cutters) consists
of a vertical cutter blade with a bullet-like terminal to which
tubing, piping, or cable is chain-attached. The sod cutter
then pulls the tubing (any diameter up to 11/4”) beneath
the surface and through the ground at speeds to a hundred
feet per minute. Laying tubing in a radius as tight as two
feet is possible. Only visible evidence of the installation is
a slit in the turf which soon disappears. For complete in-

formation, write to Ryan Equipment Company, 2055 White
Bear Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota 55109.

0 QUICK ACTION. A new mat, designed for those who want
a faster, firmer base for gymnastics and tumbling, the Super
Deluxe Varsity, is available in two sparkling colors, gold or
dark metallic blue, and comes equipped with an exclusive
snuglok zipper giving absolute safety when mats are latched
together. Complete information about this and over four
hundred other products, is available from the Program Aids
Company, 550 Garden Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York.

0 THE LEARNING Is EASY. Two new games, Grab N’ Spell
and Numer-al (a new mathematics aid), are both teaching
devices as well as games. Made of aluminum, the letters
and numbers are practically indestructible and will last
for years. There are no rough edges and the letters may
be boiled for sanitary purposes without damage. They will
not rust. With sixty-seven letters, two of each consonant
and five of each vowel, Grab N’ Spell has over two com-
plete alphabets per game. Utilizing the game approach any
number can play. The see and feel, think and do concepts are
developed with this game or teaching aid. It is particularly
well suited for the blind or slow learner where kinesthetic
is so important. Each letter is a quarter inch thick and an
inch high, just the right size to be easily recognized, light
in weight, yet substantial. Many teachers and leaders have
found the game ideal for rainy days or for play periods.
No playing boards are needed, just a desk, table, floor or
any flat surface. Each game comes in its own bag with in-
structions.

Numer-al is also a kinesthetic teaching device or game.
Each set contains aluminum numerals and symbols that
allow the leader and player to reproduce number sentences.
Several can work with one set of Numer-al. One person can

in his presentation remarks. \Ir.
Mann said. “Our eonnnission is dedi-
cated to preserving this parkland. \Ve
don"t want lconnnereial] intrusions
that mar parkland. Your kind of intru-
sion is what we welcome: the functional
and proper use of parkland and its
buildings.”

Dr. Paul Dudley White. key speaker
at the dedication. said the dedication
was “an important milestone in. the
physical rehabilitation of the American
peOple” . . . however, “It isn’t just for
the sake of exercising leg muscles that
one goes hosteling, but it is for the pur-
pose of improving relationships, men-
tal and spiritual as well as physical.”

How can a rifle designed especially for
international matches be just what U.S.
smallbore shooters are looking for? Easy.
The Anschutz people built a position rifle
to meet the new International Shooting
Union “Standard” classification. What
they came up with happens to be ideal
in weight and stock design for U.S.
match requirements.

It’s built on the same Match 54 action
that was used by 7 out of 10 of the small-
bore shooters in the Tokyo Olympics (and
all the medal winners).

The 1408 weighs about 10 pounds, easily
meets the I.S.U. limit of 5 kilograms with
sights. The single stage trigger, adjust-
able for weight of pull, creep and back-
lash, is set for 500 grams (1.1 lbs.). A re-
placement spring is included to convert
to a 3 pound pull for U.S. matches.

The 7/3" diameter, 271/2” barrel is preci-
sion rifled and hand-lapped for peak
accuracy. The French walnut stock has
adjustable butt plate, raised cheek-piece,
contoured pistol-grip and a deep fore-
end for position shooting. Full length
swivel rail and scope blocks. $145.
(Sights extra.) Left-hand stock, $1.57.

How to Conduct a Meeting

desired end with fairness to everyone
who seeks to take part in the delibera-
tions.

It is one thing to be praised for the
eHiciency of your chairmanship, and
that is worth while, but it is equally
desirable to be praised for the grace
with which you presided.

Let the audience be ever so small, or
the circumstances ever so dishearten-
ing, the chairman must perform his
role with credit to himself and his art.
What you need is not critical scholar:
ship in the rules of order, but a human
feeling for what will be most satisfy-
ing to participants.

There is no room here for spurious-
ness. Your art must be valid. Manner

and demeanor are not frivolous but
vital.

WE ALL KNOW chairmen who are

disciples of efficiency, whipping
through a multitude of items in jig
time. We know, too, how often we have
come away from their meetings with a
feeling of incompletion, of non-partici-
pation.

Courtesy is needed as well as accom-
plishment. Courtesy takes off the
sharp edge of power. It observes the
niceties, while preserving the decorum,
of debate. It detects impending con-
flict and moves in to avert an open clash.
It never shows annoyance. It opens the
door graciously for face-saving when
a speaker has crossed,the boundary of
good taste. #

GOOD REASONS WHY BRINKTUN IS NO.

Quality, price, complete line and features have made Brinktun the
unchallenged leader in Table Tennis Tables. The industry looks to
Brinktun for design features that not only improve the product but
. the game itself. Such notable firsts as Plyblend, the perfect playing
surface . . . all steel frames . . . “fold-n-roll” models that fold inward
to protect the top and roll to space saving storage. These are but a
few of the reasons why Brinktun is 1st choice with amateurs and
professionals alike and bears the approval and recommendation of
the USTTA. Compare Brinktun quality in any price range and
you'll see why it pays to go Brinktun! Write for catalog!

the tricky field of personal motivation.
Today, the recreation worker is the
only member of the treatment, health,
or rehabilitation team who can make
the patient’s healthy psychologic needs
his sole and exclusive concern. All pa-
tients, and particularly psychiatric pa-
tients, are in desperate need of getting
away, on occasion, from the state of
clinical appraisal—of being able to do
something with another person, of talk-
ing to a friend, of silently sharing the
warmth of companionship,without fear
of being booby-trapped into a clinically
significant admission.”

This guide is an unusual and fasci-
nating collection of papers which no
recreation worker, whether responsible
for handicapped or non-handicapped
clients, should be without.—-Morton

Beyond Automation, John Diebold.
McGraw-Hill, 330 West 42nd Street,
New York 10036. Pp. 220. $7.50.

W IIILE this book may not be re-

ferred to frequently by recrea-
tion and park executives, it would be
well for them to examine its contents.
It gives almost a frightening insight into
what we may expect in the future in the
way of changes as the result of automa-
tion. The book is a collection of public
addresses given at important confer-
ences around the world by the author,
one of the pioneers on this phase of ac-
celerating technology.

In the past, change was considered
just an occasional condition of our
economy and society, whereas today it
is a normal condition. This is why we
are talking more and more about crea-
tivity and creative problem solving.
Social change is one of the important
byproducts of automation; in fact, the
author believes it is the most important
byproduct. The book discusses the com-
ing events in automation through the
1970’s, which include such things as
voice recognition, automatic translation
of the spoken voice, machines that talk
back to people, and intelligent behavior
by machines. Mr. Diebold is probably
the first conspicuous pioneer to see be-
yond the machines and to recognize the
full economic and social implication of
automation. The innovations of the
present day will probably reshape mod-

ern society far more drastically than

did those machines of the first Indus-
trial Revolution. The changes in man-
power and the dislocation of people
and other factors that are already well
known to recreation people will chal-
lenge our own services. Some of the
questions that the recreation worker
needs to give more attention to might
well include: How can we keep the per-
sonal touch in our services? To what
extent are our present-day curriculums
training technicians and broad-gauged
recreation managers? What more can
we do to help our people become better
prepared to adapt to change? Certainly,
recreation workers must be increasingly
aware of the effect of automation on
society in general, and on recreation
in particular.——W. C. Sutherland, Na-
tional Recreation Association Recrea-
tion Personnel Service.

Games and Stunts for Schools,
Camps and Playgrounds, Margaret E.
Mulac. Harper and Row, 49 East 33rd
Street, New York 10016. Pp. 362.

$4.95.

THE AUTHOR has always tried, in her
books, to do more than just de-
scribe games, hobbies, or other activi-
ties. She includes methods for creating
new games and putting new life into a
program. She is a good craftsman. It
is possible, however, that by trying to
cover too wide a range of game activi-
ties for too wide an age range, Miss
Mulac does herself a disservice. The
leader who teaches “Ten Little Indians”
and other singing and circle games for
elementary-school-age children is not
likely to be the teacher who tries to
make a relay out of quantities and
measures, and the leader at a social
gathering will not get much use out of
“Saucy Coslings.”

Counting-out rhymes are part of
America’s play past. It is right that new
rhymes be added. but, surely, we should
preserve some of the old ones. Miss
Mulac’s new ones, however, are fun. We
particularly liked her first one, to he

acted out by each player:
A smile, a giggle. a frown, a pout,
A blinkle (eye blink) , a wrinkle
(nose), a pouflle (cheeks puffed

out) ,
You're OUT!

The book includes a wide variety of
games, including those that are strenu-
ous, dramatic, rhythmic, quiet, chas-
ing, and stunt games and those suitable
for banquets, picnics. travel. sidewalk,
and classroom.—V.M.
