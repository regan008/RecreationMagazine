IJVENILE BELINQUENUY—In Proper Perspective

Juvenile delinquency is on the front
l:ge again! The U. 8. Children’s Bu-
Inn has issued statements recently in-
icating a high current rate of increase
I delinquency. The Judiciary Com-
litlce of the Senate of the United States
is appointed a special subcommittee
I investigate the situation. A great
Dal of attention is being given to juve-
ile delinquency in the national and 10-
Il press. Should we, however, let or-
anized or unorganized endeavors to
'2,1] public attention to the special needs
f the comparatively small delinquent
roup unduly influence our faith in the
asic soundness of our American chil-
ren and youth?

The published figures on delinquency
re not always consistent, and although

appears safe to assume that the num-
er of reported cases is increasing at a
reater rate than is the juvenile popula-
.on of the country, the present rate is
till only about three per cent of the
)tal population of the age group con-
crned. It would be interesting to know
that these figures might be, without our
iany programs for normal, happy and
reative living!

This is the other, the happier side of
he picture and one of which we in rec-
nation and other related services can
Fell be proud. This is the side presented
.y the ninety-seven per cent of our
outh who are approaching maturity
sith only the usual aches and pains of
;rowing up. This very large per cent,
nade up of normal, healthy individuals,
llould greatly hearten all those in rec-
eation and other youth-serving organi-
:ations who have labored so long with
:ur children and young people in posi-
ive and constructive ways.

The delinquent group, now estimated
1t between 350,000 and 400,000 young
)eople, of course presents a serious
)roblem which must be solved; but in

VIE. PRENDERGAST is executive director
9f the National Recreation Association.

EEBRUARY 1954

taking a look at the world today, in
which our boys and girls must live and
grow, let us marvel not at the fact that
there are so many juvenile delinquents
but at the fact that there are so few.
When we consider the difficult strains
.and adjustments of the present, the un-
certainties of the future and the nega-
tive pressures on youth from many
sides, we should be proud of our young
people, and of the many groups which
support them in their struggle for nor-
mal living—the family, the church, the
school, the recreation agency.

Today’s increasing delinquency rate
is a direct challenge to recreation lead-
ership to increase the provision of com-
munity recreation services for all of our
young people. Experience has proven
the particular need of our program in
times of special strain. We are failing
our children and young people when we
do not battle vigorously and cour-
ageously for increased public support
for our efforts, and when we accept
unwise budget reductions at a time of
increasing need.

In replying to the request of Senator
Robert C. Hendrickson of New Jersey,
chairman of the Special’ senate subcom-
mittee now working on this problem,
for the views of the National Recreation
Association on juvenile delinquency, I
said in part:

“We have always preferred to empha-
size the positive approach because we
believe that recreation is one of the fun-
damental essentials of living, and that
as the modern-day pressures increase,
the wholesome use of leisure time has
become increasingly important to all
age groups.

“As William G. Robinson said in the
May 1951 issue of the Michigan Munici-
pal Review: ‘With the decreasing func-
tions of the home in our modern-
machine civilization, the fields of edu-
cation, religion, health protection and
recreation have increasingly been taken
over by public or community agencies.

Together with the home, they form the
environment in which the child de-
velops. It is as one of the environmental
factors that publicly supported recrea-
tion has a place in the development
of the boy and girl, and a relation-
ship with the prevention of delin-
quency. It can supplement the home
in the provision of facilities, and in
the provision of leadership. It can
provide opportunities for the family to
learn to play together. To some extent,
it can compensate for lack of under-
standing and harmony in the home. It
can never supplant the home in provid-
ing for the play life of the child.

“ ‘Recreation operates in a positive
way in its relation to delinquency by
building in the boy or girl interests,
skills and resources which crowd out
the call of the gang. . . .

“ ‘The prevention of delinquency is
frequently a compelling argument in
securing support for recreation. The
relation may be hard to prove statisti-
cally, its importance is frequently ex-
aggerated, but there are on record ex-
pressions of opinions from many judges,
probation officers, and police to the ef-
fect that recreation programs have de-
creased delinquency. Fathers and moth-
ers, as well as educators and students
of the behavior of children and youth,
are united in recognizing that disaster
follows where the play life is not recog-
nized in the environment of. children
and youth.’ ”

The fight against delinquency is a
battle on two fronts. We must support
the forces of proper treatment and care,
of which recreation is an important
member. We must lead the forces of
prevention by making it possible for our
children and youth to live normal, well-
adjusted lives even in these trying times.
Let us tackle the total job in proper per-
spective—let us be as concerned with
the latter as with the former—and let us
keep our faith in our youth, and by do-
ing so keep faith with our youth.

) A VERY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-vANDALISM
CAMPAIGN has been carried out by the
Kiwanis and Key Club Districts in New
England. Many ' towns proclaimed
“Anti-Vandalism Day,” in which the
main events were panel discussions on
this problem, poster distribution, school
assemblies, and cooperation with other
youth organizations. Parents, school
authorities, civic officials, clergymen,
and high school boys and girls of the
local communities participated in the
project.

) IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO JUVENILE
DELINQUENCY Joseph Prendergast, as
executive director of the National Rec-
reation Association, has been invited to
testify at the hearings of the special sub-
committee of the Judiciary Committee
of the U. S. Senate. It is expected that
the Association’s testimony on the place
of community recreation in the preven-
tion of uvenile delinquency will be
presented on January 21. As we go to
press this has not as yet taken place; but
further information on the hearing will
be reported in the March issue of REC-
REATION.

) IN A RECENT SURVEY of the present
and potential value of Active Associate
Membership in the National Recreation
Association for recreation leaders below
the executive level, questionnaires were
sent to the country’s recreation execu-
tives. One-third have answered so far.
Tabulation of returns indicates an over-
whelming majority feel that all recrea-

Editorially Speaking

 

Shell Your Own Corn

In an editorial, in the Art Education-
ist, editor Clyde C. Clack says:

“There is an old story about the needy
farmer who wanted bread but refused
a turn of corn because it wasn’t shelled.
Many people have nurtured a similar
attitude toward art. . . .

“Evidence of this desire to have some-
one else shell their artistic corn has
been seen in the long practice of depend-
ing on mental crutches to produce pic-
tures, designs, craft objects . . . These
have most often taken the form of trac-
ing or copying pictures; use of pre-
drawn patterns for craft gadgets; pic-
tures and objects to color; and ready-
formed molds for casting clay or plastic
objects.

“Through the years art educators
have been striving to overcome this
attitude . . . both at school and in the
community. They have stressed . . . the
importance of original creative work
done by each individual. Observations
have indicated that noticeable progress
has been made . . .

“During the last twelve or eighteen
months, however, this encouraging feel-
ing has received a shock. It has come
in a form that seems to be more dis-
couraging to the creative approach than
the older practises of tracing and col-
oring. The old methods did require
some eflort at drawing and selecting
one’s own colors. The new ‘road block’
has eliminated all drawing and even
the choosing or naming of colors, be-
cause the colors are numbered—also
the spaces where they are to be placed
—thus eliminating the need for all
creative thinking.

“The wide acceptance of these pre-
created pictures and craft objects brings
into sharp focus the urgency for re-
newed faith in the value and importance
of a sound creative approach to one’s
art experiences.”

Leisure

The third session of the New York

Herald Tribune Forum, last fall, was
devoted to the subject of leisure. Among
comments that evening, C. Wright Mills,
Associate Professor of Sociology,
Columbia University, said:

“The mass production of distraction
is now as much a part of the American
way of life as the mass production of

72

automobiles. In fact, the values that
make up this way of life are more and
more the values of an ethic of leisure.
For, as work declines in meaning and
gives no inner direction or center,
leisure becomes the end of life itself,
and the leisure ethic swallows up all
values, including those of work.

“The most important questions to ask
of any sphere of society are: What
kinds of men and women does it tend to
create? What personal styles of life
does it inculcate and reinforce? .

“What leisure— genuine leisure—
ought to do is to relax our attention
so that we come to know better our true
selves and our capacities for creative
experience. Beyond animal rest, which
is both necessary and for many today
quite diilicult to get, genuine leisure al-
lows and encourages our deve10pment
of greater and truer individuality.
Leisure ought to be what work ought
to be, and what neither of them usually
is: a sphere of independent action. . .

“The so-called problem of leisure, in
short, is the problem of how we can
heighten the qualities of experience in
all areas of American life to such an
extent that there will be no problem
of leisure.” '-

They Say About Juvenile
Delinquency

“The boy who shows up at the city
parks and the supervised playground is
inoculated against delinquency or he
wouldn’t show up. Such activities do
not attract the cocky, adventurous boy.
Why not let the boys form a hot-rod

group—go to the police chief or th
mayor and ask for a ‘drag strip” wher
they can test their cars instead of bein
picked up for going eighty miles a
hour?”—Dr‘. Walter Reckless, Ohi
State University.

“There is no single answer to juvenil
delinquency. It is a problem in the SOll
tion of which the community, the schoo
the church, the home—in fact ever
good citizen—must play a part. Her
are literally boundless Opportunitie
and responsibilities for voluntary we
fare organizations.”—Mrs. Oveta Cul

Hobby, Secretary, Department c
Health, Education, and Welfare.

“We have a feeling the public is jus
about fed up with the interminable fint
ings by all sorts of local and nation:
committees which compile facts 0
juvenile delinquency that are alread
well established and come to conch
sions that have long been obvious.”—

An Editor’s Opinion

We are forever being asked the que:
tion: Why doesn’t East Orange have

give is that East Orange had ming

Little League was ever heard of, an
still has them. Little League gets a lot (
national publicity, too much we thin
sometimes, but the primary purpose {
it all is to get youngsters playing bas
ball. They can do that in East Oran;
with uniforms and with organize
leagues. And we don’t get any of tl
professionalism and comlnercialis:
here that seems to be a part of the Litt
League program. Little League is fil
where you have no other baseball pru

OR the first time in its history, Provi-

dence, Rhode Island, now has a
year-round public recreation program.
Three full-time indoor centers house
varied activities for twelve months of
the year. Seven junior high schools
and two new gymnasiums operate in the
fall and winter. There are two new
outdoor swimming pools adjacent to
the gyms, now the most popular
summertime facilities, and forty-two
playgrounds. Seasonal gaps are filled
with city-wide community events.

Providence now ranks well up among
the cities of its size in facilities and
activities offered its young people, with
a start made towards provision for
adults too. All this has grown from an
inadequate summer playground pro-
gram, which was all that the city had
seven years ago.

As has doubtless been true in other
communities, World War II, with its
labor and material shortages, played

havoc with the recreation program in

Providence. It was impossible to get
qualified recreation workers, even had
there been the same conception of

desirable personnel standards in Provi-
dence that there is now. Many times,
boys and girls scarcely older than the
playground children themselves were
hired as leaders.

The general unrest of wartime may
have been one cause for widespread
vandalism. Playground shelter houses
were wrecked. Materials and labor were
available for repairing them.
General dilapidation and neglect charac-
terized the playgrounds throughout the
city.

Children showed the effects of this
situation in restlessness, even greater
than that brought about by war and
post-war dislocations. Juvenile delin-
quency was its most serious manifesta-
tion. Social agencies and, increasingly,
the general public demanded reform.

The then Mayor Roberts, now Rhode
Island’s governor, accepted the chal-
lenge. Appointing a committce of lead-
ing citizens to advise him, he called for

It was spent for repairs to thirteen ol
playground shelter houses, the erectior
of ten new ones to replace those whic
had been wrecked beyond repair, the
two new Olympic swimming pools witl
attached gymnasiums, and for severa
new playgrounds and playfields.

In 1947, a new department of recrea-
tion, independent of the park departi
ment which previously had urisdiction,
was organized. Among other things. the
new department undertook to maintain
its own play areas, which Operation
now takes by far the biggest slice out
of its budget.

Since that time a second million dol-
lars has been approved. Earmarked1
principally for two more new swimming!
pools, its expenditure awaits its place
in the time schedule of the city’s capi-
tal eXpenditures for all municipal im-
provements.

The annual budget to Operate this
greatly expanded plant has umped four

times—from around $50,000 to $284.-

7 for the fiscal year 1953-54, as com-
red to that of $257,388 in the previous
ar. Pool-use fees offset this a little.
1e last increase is accounted for by a
neral increase in salaries and wages
r all city employees.

Most recently the city plan commis-

n, in a master plan for playgrounds

d playfields, proposed that the city
end approximately $6,000,000 more

cr the next twenty to thirty years to

tribute play areas more evenly
roughout the city. Providence is
ndicapped by the fact that many of
5 existing grounds, located on rough
illsides, cannot be used to advantage
nd because playgrounds were estab-
shed
1anged the areas of greatest need.

The new department of recreation
as a committee of seven, meeting
lonthly with the mayor and director, to
dvise on over-all policies. Members are
to judge of the juvenile court, super-
Itendcnt of schools, an Italian settle-
rent house director, CYO director, a
legro of high standing, a Jewish and

Protestant civic leader—the latter
so being women.

The administrative staff consists of a
irector, two assistant directors, two
Ill-time recreation leaders, one music-
:creation leader and a director of pub-
c relations. The maintenance division
'. headed by a superintendent and em-
loys thirteen full-time laborers and

One swimming instructor is in charge

ishiers, two ticket takers, four counter

'ornan director and two recreation
raders at each pool gymnasium, plus

 

The NRA district representative
says of Providence:

“Last year the Pravidence recreatian
department exceeded the million mark
in numbers of participants. This does
not include spectators. Jock Cranin is
doing a fine job in assisting private
agencies; his special activities depart-
ment is outstanding. There are abaut
sixteen special events an a city-wide
basis during the year. He has a special
TV program an the air very frequently.
These are 'live' programs including the
children of the city. There has been an
excellent reactian to this—tram bath the

tion leaders, as well as part-time recrea-
tion leadcrs and specialists- The school
centers also are staffed with directors
and recreation leaders. '

National Recreation Association per-
sonnel standards are followed for the
most part. In the early days of the new
department, prospective recreation
workers were required to attend NRA
training institutes. But more recently
in-service training from department
officials has been established.

What do the children get out of all
this?

Periodical city-wide events are held.
These include fishing rodeos with the
swimming pools stocked with trout;
pushmobile and kite races; Thanksgiv-
ing turkey and Easter egg hunts; snow-
ball contests; bicycle races with em-
phasis on safe riding; ping-pong and
checker tournaments; pet shows and

block dances.

The department cooperates with the
Providence Journal in running twenty-
four baskctball and thirty-two baseball
teams for boys fourteen years old and
younger, and eight girls’ basketball
teams. With its own two hundred sum-
mer baseball teams, it is estimated that
four thousand girls and boys partici-
pate.

Periodically there are city-wide field
days in outlying parks where children
gather for day-long programs of sports
and contests.

It was an interesting conversion of
facilities when an old police station in
one of the most congested districts
of the city was renovated into an attrac-
tive center for boys. (It is still bright
and colorful after several years” use
because the boys themselves wash the
walls and floors.)

The city acquired another three-story
brick building with attached gymnasi-
um when it exchanged other property
for the former Jewish Community Cen-
ter building. Largely served in this area
is a Negro district. An abandoned
school building in another crowded
area brought a wide variety of activities
to a population in which Portuguese
and Irish prevail.

One of the most constructive activ-
ities in this last-mentioned building is
a toy-lending library. Toys are gathered
and repaired by the local branch of
the American Association of University
Women, and private-school girls stock
it. Toys are loaned by card, as are books
from a public library. Child patrons

creditably meet the challenge of return-

dition as can be eXpected from normal
youngsters.

Activities in the pool gymnasiums
during the winter emphasize the dual

ganizations such as the CYO and private
settlement houses have been given use
of the gyms when it did not conflict with
that of the department itself.

Music, dancing, sewing, some cook-
ing, painting, arts and crafts, jet-auto
racing, dramatics, parties, woodwork~
ing, charm schools, quiet games and
gymnastics are on the programs of most
of these centers. The recreation pro-
gram is facilitated through the use of
the schools’ machine, art-metal and
woodworking shops.

Sumlner playground programs have
expanded greatly. Weekly special
events vary the tenor of traditional ac-
tivities which might otherwise become
monotonous as the summer wears on.

To date, activities for adults have in-
cluded family fishing rodeos, neighbor-
hood movies and social hours for old
people in a housing project.

‘VHAT MAGIC in those words, adventure, wilderness solitude,
packs and portages, and canoes slipping down wild beau-

tiful waterways. Canoe trips mean getting away from the
conventional—roads, airplanes, motor boats, established
camps. They mean tents and sleeping bags, campfires and
the calling of the loons, northern lights, and singing. Canoe
trails will always have appeal, just as they had appeal to the
men of the wilderness two centuries ago.

In the early days voyageurs of the Hudson’s Bay Com-
pany traveled the Quetico-Superior region up along the Min-
nesota-Ontario border just as modern voyageurs do today.
They were hardy men from Montreal and Quebec, who lived
bountifully on peas and pork and whatever else they could
find along the trails. They packed prodigious loads and pad-
dled twenty hours a day. Weird legends have come down to
us of these loads, how they scorned anything less than two of
the regular ninety-pound packets of fur.

Mighty,men these French voyageurs, and happy men to
boot, proud of their calling as only men can be who have
learned to love a way of life. They liked to sing as they
fought their way across lakes and portages and their ancient
chanson echoed from the shores wherever they went. Count-
less rivers, portages, and lakes, from Quebec to the head-
waters of the great McKenzie in the far northwest, bear such
names as Lac la Croix, Dieu Riviere, Maligne and Grand
Marais, testimony to their passing.

For almost a hundred years, along their route, the wat.
ways were forgotten, but now once more there is singi
and joy on the trails. Today a new type of voyageur is w
us, thousands of young men and women from the towns 3
cities of the United States and Canada. They are carryi
on the traditions, following the historic routes along 1
border, camping on the old campsites. They have entel
into the wilderness way of life with the same joy and ab:
don as the voyageurs of old.

To those who have never taken a canoe trip, it seems I
an impossible thing to do. Sure it would be fun, you s:
but I don’t belong to an organized group and just do
know how to go about it. What sort of equipment does c
take. How about maps and food and getting lost in w
country? How does one get along out of touch with sto:
and supplies? And isn’t it a pretty reckless thing to do
one isn’t a good paddler?

Such questions are legitimate but they can all be answel
easily. For a good many years I acted as guide in the wild
ness canoe country of the Quetico-Superior and for so:
time after that as manager of an outfitting post. I’ve se
a lot of inexperienced parties go in and know what they a
up against. I’ve also seen them come back hardened a

brown, paddling like veterans and already planning their
next year’s trip. The majority of them were as green and
uncertain as you, and not a little apprehensive, but this they
all had in common, they wanted to know what wilderness
living was like. They wanted to get away from civilization
and they all had a deep inherent love of the out-of-doors.
Actually it is a very simple thing to prepare for a canoe
trip- You can either bring your own outfit and food or
depend on one of the outfitters at your jumping off place.
Suppose you don’t want to go to the expense and bother
of assembling your own outfit and transporting it to your
starting place, then all you have to do is write to the
outfitter, let him know how many there will be in your

party and how long you will be gone. For an average charge
of about five dollars per day per person, he will have your
food and outfit packed and ready when you arrive, load
you up with maps and good advice and start you off for the
wilds without more ado. He’ll take care of..your car while
you’re gone, or meet you at the train, bus or airport, store
your valuables, collect and hold your mail, and even send
back postcards at convenient intervals as I did once, saying
the conventional and reassuring “Wish you werex here,
having wonderful time.”

It is as simple as that; and I know because I’ve started
a good many parties out just that way, have seen them
weave down the first waterways and return later like old
timers heading straight for the landing. The only qualifica-
tion is that you be in reasonably good health, have a disre-
gard for mosquitos and black flies, rain and wind and sleep-
ing on the ground, not to mention the necessity of carrying
things and being on your own.

If you want to assemble your own outfit and keep it for

trips year after year, you can follow the list below for two
people and not go far wrong.

Canoe—fifteen- or sixteen-footer.

Paddles—two and a spare.

Yolk—for carrying canoe.

Tent—aven-by-seven with good mosquito bar sewn in.

FEBRUARY 1954

Nesting set—three parts with good handles.

Frying pan—medium size.

Grill—optional.

Reflector oven—-optional.

Miscellaneous utensils, knives, forks, Spoons, plates, cups, pancake
turner, can opener, good lightweight axe.

Air beds—two three-quarter-length, lightweight.

Sleeping bags—lightweight, down or wool, or a double and a
single wool blanket per person.

Packsacks—two or three with a duffle bag. (A pack basket is a
good addition.)

Ponchos—lightweight.

Your personal outfit should include a flashlight, water-
proof matchbox, compass, knife, first aid kit, camera and
film, fishing equipment. Beware heavy tackle boxes—all
you need for a wilderness canoe trip, if lures are chosen
carefully, is a very small package.

As far as clothing is concerned, you need only take along
what you would ordinarily use at any camp in the north.
Include a change but no more than one. There is always
plenty of water for washing clothes. Most people on their
first trip take far more than they need. A warm jacket or
sweater, or a wool shirt, are good for a cool evening, and
don’t forget a pair of moccasins and extra wool socks. A
good voyageur can put all of his personal things in a very
small pack. The real mark of an amateur is an outsized
pack of items that cannot possibly be used.

As to food, there is always the matter of personal choice.
However, the standard food list for two people for ten days
is time tested in the north and works out pretty well as far
as variety and amount is concerned. There are always basic
items which must go along no matter what your preference,

but there is usually plenty of room for variety. The essentials

are:

1 lh. shortening
5 lb. hacon

2 lb. ham

IA), lb. salt pork
1/2 lb. dried beef
1 lb. corn beef

1 lb. rice

2 pkg. dehydrated potatoes

2 pkg. dehydrated soup mixes

2 lb. brown sugar for syrup

1 lb. regular coffee or 1 can
instant coffee

1 lb. summer sausage (hard) 1%; lb. tea
1 lb. cheese ‘ 1A), lb. salt
1 dozen fresh eggs or dehydrated 1 can pepper
eggs 1 can dehydrated ,cream

2 lb. tinned butter 2 pkg. dehydrated milk

1 lb. onions 3 lb. dried fruit

1 lb. navy beans 2 small cans tomatoes or

2 lb. white sugar tomato concentrate

1 lb. flour pkg. raisins

2 lb. Bisquick bars German sweet chocolate
1 lh. corn meal jar jam

1 lb. pancake flour box matches, large

4 loaves bread dish towels

1 pkg. hardtack candles
1 lb. oatmeal large bar soap
1 pkg. macaroni DDT bomb

scouring pad
roll toilet paper

1/2 lb. split peas
$6 lh. lima beans

NOTE—There are many dessert and baking mix-es available as well
as concentrated and dehydrated meal preparations which can supple-
ment the above. It is taken for granted that fish will be added to
the above list.

I—II—II—II—IMMI—II—IMI—l

Breakfast should be a substantial meal: pancakes and
bacon, dried fruit and cereal, plenty of coffee, tea or dried
milk. Most of the work of the day will be done before lunch,
that is if you get up with the birds as you should. The wilder-
ness is no place for a piece of dried whole wheat toast, a
cigarette, and a cup of black coffee. You want food that

sticks to your ribs, that gives power to your paddle and
ambition on the portages.

77

 

Open point with view and breeze, is prerequisite of ideal
campsite. Above choice shows Sarah Lake from high bluff.

Lunch is snack time: hardtack, cheese or'hard summer
sausage, raisins, a bit of chocolate bar, and on a wet day
a cup of tea. If you eat more than that you’ll be loggy
the rest of the afternoon. Build up your appetite for the big
meal of the day.

Supper time is the big affair, and you can go the limit.
If you have picked up a fish during the afternoon, you can
use that with plenty of rice, or heans, or dehydrated
potatoes, finish it up with a bowl of dried fruit or blue-
berries or raspberries in season, perhaps some hot biscuits
or cornbread from your reflector oven. The main thing to
remember in wilderness cooking is simplicity and variety.
There is no reason why you cannot live as bountifully off
the ordinary basic food list with a little ingenuity as you can
in town.

As far as paddling is concerned, the hardest thing for
the amateur to learn is the stern or spoon stroke—learning
to bring your blade out of the water with an outward or
spoon-like dip. Many never master it, but actually it takes
only a few minutes to learn and, once learned, it 'is the only
way to paddle a canoe. All old-timers use it and it works
as no other stroke does. It is well to remember that the upper
hand and wrist do all the work, that the lower hand is merely
the fulcrum.

The bow stroke is very simple but the bow man must
remember that it is his responsibility to set the timing for
the stroke and to watch out for rocks. He will learn many
little tricks in time and he should trade off with the stern-
man to get the experience of actually guiding the canoe.

In paddling, balance and poise are more important than
anything else. If you can ride your canoe as though you
were riding a horse, adjusting yourself instinctively to wind
and current, then you are on the way. Once you get the feel
of a canoe, it becomes obedient almost to a change of
thought. That is perhaps why paddling a canoe gives more
satisfaction and joy than almost any other form of loco-
motion. Perhaps that’s why the voyageurs sang.

Packing over the portages requires much the same tech
nique, balance and poise. Never overload your packs and
never try to carry too heavy a load. Don’t try to do what
the voyageurs did; and forget about the head strap until
your neck muscles ‘are broken in. Double back over a portage
rather than try to make it all in one trip. Even the voyageurs
did that. Remember that time is not important hack in the
bush and that portages can be as much fun as paddling.

78

Canoe yolks are far better than paddles for carrying, but‘
they too should be well balanced so that the canoe on your
shoulders does not tip one way or the other.

In planning your day, get up early, say five or five-thirty.
Enjoy the cool of the morning, the bird songs and the
freshness. It is a shame to sleep away the best part of the
day. Get breakfast over with, camp taken down, and the
outfit packed and ready for the trail long before the sun
is high.

Never make camp later than four-thirty or five in the
afternoon. In that way you can get camp set up and supper
dishes done in time to enjoy the sunset and perhaps take
a quiet paddle before you roll in. It’s no fun pitching camp
in the dark; and if you’re going to get up early, you’ve got
to get a good night’s sleep.

Pick your campsites on Open points and islands, prefer-
ably with a view and a breeze. Campsites are far more than
just places to pitch a tent and cook a meal or two. Half of
every twenty-four hours is spent there, so the site should
be as convenient and delightful as possible. Campsites are
wilderness homes and as much care should be taken in their
choice as though you planned to stay there indefinitely.

The wilderness camper has a real responsibility toward
these stopping places, not only as far as his own enjoyment
is concerned but to those who may follow him. When he
leaves, every bit of evidence should be picked up, every
bit of string, tin foil, or paper. All trash and garbage should
be burned and then the remains buried. Cans and glass
should either be sunk in the deepest part of the lake or
buried far from the campsite itself. Then poles and stakes
should be neatly stacked and the campsite given the ap-
pearance of having been newly scrubbed and cleaned. No
good woodsman ever leaves a messy camp. It is simply good
courtesy to leave it fresh and uncluttered. As an added bit
of thOUghtfulness, he might leave a little pile of kindling
and some firewood next to the fireplace. That one little touch
will make the newcomer happy.

But one of the most important things to remember if
you are contemplating a canoe trip is to prepare yourself as
to the country’s history long before you go in. If it is to be
the wilderness lake-country of the Quetico-Superior, read
up on the voyageurs and the early explorers so that you will
realize as you traverse the ancient waterways that here was
a highway of romance and adventure long before you were
born. The enjoyment of any country is increased tremen-
dously if you know something about it.

It will also increase your appreciation of the wilderness
interior of the Quetico-Superior region if you inform your-
self of the long conservation effort of the President’s Com-
mittee in COOperation with the U. 5. Forest Service and the
great conservation groups such as the Izaak Walton League
of America who for over a quarter of a century have
attempted to protect its wilderness character from eXploita-
tion by commercial interests. When you paddle down those
lakes and rivers and see them as the voyageurs must have
seen them two hundred years ago, it is worth knowing that
they have not changed simply because a great many pe0ple
have thought their preservation worthwhile. (See book
review, Land and Water Trails, page 128 ——-Ed.)

RECREATION

Digested from talk given at National conference of Social \Vork, June 1953

HE discussion of this subject has been marked over the

past decade, at least, by a futile search for a formula.
lere was the formula that stated that the public recreation
Dency provided basic recreation services which everyone
Beds, while voluntary agencies carried out the experimental
1d dcmonstrative services.
There was another formula to the effect that public
gencies should provide recreation services to those who
[I] make use of them without much encouragement, while
e voluntary agencies must go after the hard-to-reach
'oups.
Again there was the formula that public agencies should
'ovide facilities—eXpensive gymnasiums, auditoriums,
viinming pools, and so on. Voluntary agencies would pro-
de the highly skilled workers needed to conduct recrea-
mal activities.
One must not conclude that the reverse of these formulas
true. Rather, if there is anything that is nearly generally
ue, I believe it to be the statement by a veteran superin-
ndcnt of recreation, now retired, who said, “The public
gency can do anything the taXpayers want it to do.” Even
is needs certain exceptions, for example: (a) “except
omoting the interests of a particular religious faith,” and
I) “except promoting social action against itself.” In spite
' these exceptions, the statement serves as a valid and
reded warning to voluntary agency workers who are in-
ined to have a condescending attitude toward their col-
agues in the public departments.
1f the conclusion is generally sound that the public depart-
ents can do whatever the citizens want them to do, the
vision of labor between the public departments and the
nluntary agencies is different in different communities.
anning the recreation services for a community, therefore,
volves a diagnosis of the local situation, in order to deter-
ine how far the public departments can go toward meeting
cryone’s need for recreation.
In making such diagnoses, there are some considerations
at should always be in the minds of those responsiblc
r recreation programs: ,
The appraisal of the local situation is the responsibility
all agencies offering recreation services, and requires the
rticipation of representatives of the general public as well.
The public departments are responsible to the total com-
unity. If public recreation funds are inadequate, and
ey usually are, the public department cannot justify the
ovision of a rich and well-rounded recreation program to
e section of the city and little or no services to another.
3r can it expect a lone playground supervisor to forsake
{3 large number of children who make extensive use of the
ogram in order to seek out and woo a few individuals
groups who need very special attention.

3. The responsibility of the voluntary agencies does not
end with participation in the diagnosis of the community’s
readiness to support a good public recreation program.
Each agency, through its board of directors, staff and mem-
bers, is in a position to influence public Opinion. It can,
therefore, perform valuable service to the recreation needs
of the community by developing stronger and more generous
public support for municipal recreation departments. I
firmly believe that the voluntary agencies working with
people in their leisure time can be more effective in achiev-
ing the purposes for which they were established if the
needs of pe0ple for recreation are richly and fully met
through tax-supported agencies.

The assumption behind this belief is that each voluntary
agency and each public agency has its own distinctive pur-
pose and function. Because all are working with people
during .their leisure time, along with churches, fraternal
and social organizations and commercial recreation, all are
contributing some part of the total recreation services avail-
able to the community. However, it does not follow that
they are completely interchangeable.

The ideal relationship among the public’ and voluntary
agencies providing group work, informal education and
recreation services to a community is one of teamwork. This
teamwork is called for in studying the community, its needs
and resources. It is needed in planning as varied and as full
a recreation program as the community is willing to support.

It can only happen where the leaders of each agency know
and respect the purposes, resources, and special functions
of every other agency. Moreover, these leaders recognize
that the desired goal is that pe0ple of the community shall
have the best possible recreational Opportunities, rather than
that one’s own agency shall gain special advantage.

M v éURPoss TODAY will be to give a

little background of what plan-
ning is as a function of municipal ad-
ministration. One of my current classes
at Columbia covers a full semester on
this subject, but I shall try to sum-
marize it briefly. Then Mr. Fagin and
Mr. Howard will proceed to bring the
subject down to earth. They are two of
the most brilliant planners in the United
States, bringing to their work not only
great competence in craftsmanship but
tremendous ability to think clearly. Mr.
Fagin will discuss something of the ob-
jectives of planning and the alternatives
that a community must examine in
making its choice as to the kind of com-
munity it wants to be. Mr. Howard will
deal somewhat with methods and con-
siderably with the criteria of evaluation
of the things that we undertake to do in
recreation.

Just what do you mean—modern
city? When you come into Philadelphia

one that was built yesterday, it is mod-

we call modern, but it is the aggregate

been doing (or what has been left of
them) during the whole lifetime of that
city—the things that were motivated by
considerations of the moment but which
leave an impression on the city that sub-
sequent generations have to live with.

A little group of Dutch villagers es-
tablished their houses and other build-
ings and laid out their streets on the
lower end of Manhattan Island in ac-
cordance with the location of the
swamps and the hills and the streams,
and the relation of residences to the
waterfront that existed three centuries
ago—considerations that lost their sig-
niiicance. the greater part of three cen-
turies ago but that dictated the pattern
of urbanization of that little commu-
nity, its crystalization into a structure of
streets and building locations and di-
versity of ownership. Those considera-
tions of three centuries ago determined
the street pattern that we today must
continue to use on the lower end of
Manhattan. A city is the resultant of
what may be called the physical residua
of what people do from year to year and
month to month and day to day, moti-
vated by considerations that are im-
portant at the time.

Planning simply seeks to set an ob-
j ective for the city out of which are de-

I recently had an interesting 6

I thought that I would find out
their concepts were, as a guide to

I asked them what they though
planning is. I used the term “city
ning” as a generic term for all co
nity planning. one student, w
even pausing for breath, said:
planning is the coordination and r
al integration of the physical, socia
economic forces that impinge 0

that you couldn’t even catch i

lie was perfectly honest, and 1 think we
are going to have an interesting time.
Somewhere between those two view-
points is the reality of planning.
Conflicts may arise in the use of land
1nd the provision of public facilities.
Pnc of the geniuses of planning is that
:t deals with the “togetherness” ot
tings or bringing things into rela-
on and finding out how they should
alance, not only in physical rela-
ionships but in their claim for pub-
ic attention as part of the adminis-
Iration of the municipality and in their
llaim for the allocation of funds by the
nunicipality. You can’t get an orderly
mswer, either as to the physical togeth-
srncss of things, or in the evaluation of
he budget of time and money to pro-
ridc things, without the process which
we call planning. There is a lot of ho-
mm about planning and about what
haster plans are, but planning is really

nity? Public things and private things.
The public things are streets and play-
grounds and sewer systems and public
buildings and park areas, and so on,
and in the main the community itself is
responsible for these. Mr. Fagin, par-
ticularly, will indicate how prior de-
terminations as to policy should influ-
ence the provision of these things. The
private part of the community is the
bulk of the community. It consists of
land, and what people do on the land,
and how they use it, and the things that
they put on it. Planning provides a
pattern for the location, character, ex-
tent and timing of the public things in
the community—a pattern, if you please
—and it provides a guide that is not
quite a pattern in the same sense of
the term for the physical form and char-
acter of what private pe0ple do with and
on the land.

Now with respect to the public things,
the planning function itself initiates and
carries out public action. With respect

ust plain common sense. Planners are
requently called stargazers and I sup-
>ose planners who make plans without

my idea of what is going to be done
lbout them merit the name; but if you
vant to get a real stargazer, a person
vho is really impractical, take the guy
lvho thinks of himself as being practical
1nd thinks that he can deal with prob-
ems of community development in a
fragmentary way and without doing
:ome long-range thinking.

We are concerned, in our planning,
with the physical community. We are
:oncerned with how land is used and
low pe0ple get around and how the
physical facilities of the community are
nrranged. What makes up the commu-

[EBRUARY 1954

The terrific competition for land, which is increasing instead of dc-

to the private development of the city,
the process of planning gives direction
to forces in motion. You can designate
a residential area in a zoning scheme
but that, of itself, doesn’t build a single
house. The planner needs to know what
forces are in operation in the commu-
nity and how to give them direction to-
ward the production of the kind of com-
munity which is desired.

As to the machinery of planning, we
think a great deal about the planning
board and may think that planning is
what the planning board does. If that
is so in a city, if the planning function
is the exclusive function of the planning
board, then that city isn’t planning.
Planning is a function that must perme-

ate all the operations of municipal gov-
ernment. It must become a way of do-
ing things. The planning board is the
one agency whosc only function is that
of planning, of studying and evolving
proposals for recommendation and, to
some extent, of participation in the ad-
ministration of the application of the
resulting policies to the development of
the city as to its form and character.
But the planning function, in its most
important aspects, is a function of the
legislative body, and a function of the
executive, and a function of the admin-
istrative departments of government,
with respect to which the planning
board has a coordinating responsibility.

The planning board does have the
viewpoint that sees the togetherness that
must be had in order to do an effective
job of guiding the form and character
of the community. It must do a sensi-
tive job in evaluation of the forces that
are impinging on the community. But,
again, the planning function is one that
must permeate the entire structure of
public administration.

In our own county we have had a
striking examplc of this with respect to
the function of our department of plan-
ning in the capital budgeting process
of the county, under which the county
lays out a program of capital expendi-
tures over a period of years. We are
operating under a recent charter amend-
ment that changed the original setup
bccause it wasn’t working. Under the
former scheme, the planning commis-
sion wrote letters to the budget director
and the board of supervisors giving its
recommendations on projects. The com-
mission supposedly had responsibility
for actually doing- the programing. This
involved fiscal planning, but the com-
mission never could find out the limits
within which it was supposcd to pro-
gram, and never could do any actual
programing.

The new charter amendment limits
the commission’s function to physical
planning but it makes the commission a
participant in the work of a group op-
erating at the top policy level. By this
process planning begins to take on an
effectiveness that it could not have when
the commission merely made recom-

mendations from the outside.

The planning process consists, first,

81

of basic studies of the community and
what is happening to it. There is ob-
viously no time here to go into all the
rather sensitive factors that must be
taken into account in this regard. Then
comes the formulation of plans, ex-
pressed both in lines and spaces on a
map and in standards and policies. All
this is prefatory to programs for carry-
ing out the plans. These programs fall
into two major categories: thc things
that are done as a guide to public ac-
tion and the things that are done to in-
fluence private action. The things to
guide public actions are (a) the capital
budget and (b) the use of plans and
planning as guides in the current ad-
ministrative operations of government.
Let me illustrate the latter. When the
municipality takes over some tax-fore-
closed land, there should be someone
who says, “Let’s see if we need that land
for a playground,” and there should be
an established municipal policy and a

plan by which to determine that ques-
tion, as against the thoughtless urge to
get all tax-foreclosed land back on the
tax rolls as soon as possible.
Incidentally, this idea that taking
land off the tax rolls is necessarily bad
is dangerously misleading. The largest
single kind of land in the urban com-
munity that is off the tax rolls is normal-
ly that which is devoted to streets. If
that land were not “off the tax rolls,”
there wouldn’t be very much else on
them. So it is with all those things that
are necessary to provide sound com-
munity life. If we don’t take land oftr
the tax rolls for playgrounds and parks,
we don’t make it possible to develop the
structure of values that the community
wants on the tax rolls—if you put the
question in terms of dollars and cents.
The community plan as a current ad-
ministrative guide is an exceedingly
important thing, and that is one reason
why planning must permeate the oper-

ations of government and become a co}
cern of all the operating department

With respect to private action, pla
ning seeks to establish guides for wh
pcople do on and with the land. Th1
there are patterns for land developme
that are exemplified in the ofhcial m2
and in subdivision control; there a
patterns for the nature and the inte
sity of the use of land as expressed
zoning; and there are various other re
ulatory devices for giving a gener
guide for the forces of private enterpri
in motion. Finally, planning is a co
tinuing process, and it requires contin
ing re-study.

That is a thumbnail sketch, in pro
ably bewildering form, of some of '0‘
concepts of planning, In the next h
talks, I want you to get a real story th
you can put to work, as told by the oth
members of the panel.

BECBEATHJN at the grass roots

Quoted from talk by Governor M cKeldin at the Governor’s
Conference on Recreation, State Teachers College, Towson,

Maryland, March 1953.

The nearest thing to home-style recreation is the strictly
community teen center —where youngsters are all members
of the same general neighborhood, getting together for a
social evening on one or two nights—preferably one—each
week—where each knows and understands the other—and
where each is known and understood by the supervisor in
charge.

I am definitely not sympathetic to that opposite extreme
which permits wandering bands of teen-agers to attend one
center on one night and another on the next, getting to as
many as possible in the course of a week. I understand that
most of the centers’ operations are on Friday or Saturday
nights, but almost equally bad is the group trip to several
recreation centers in a single night. ‘

Frequently the wandering groups are looking for trouble
of one kind or another—and frequently they find  Un-
fortunately, such trouble usually involves boys and girls
who were not looking for it.

There is, I understand, one professional viewpoint that
the teen center would not be serving its best purpose if it
were to bar anyone, including the known trouble makers—

from attendance—that it always is the hope of those

of their ways and somehow brought to reform.

That, perhaps is the basic theory and the noble vieWpoi

But surely, those in charge of the public teen center ha
an obligation to the young seekers after clean recreati
and wholesome pleasure, as well as to the parents w

Yes, I believe that the community teen center—stric
for the community youngsters and their bona fide, approv

a true recreational purpose, and a good community servir
I feel that those parents, who are deluded into believi
that their children are benelitted by frequenting seve:
different teen centers are making a serious mistake.
The recreation profession is a worthy one, capable

munity in which it operates. It has done much good; and I

Grand Junction Sign on main high-

. or children to complete craft projects.

VIIREE years ago the recreation com-
mission of Grand Junction recom-
1ended to the community that we

tend a welcome hand to travelers
passing through our town. This friendly
altitude of our community is reflected
in thc sign you see in the picture. Our
first thought was for the children of the
tourists who might enjoy a comfortable
11ace to relax, exercise and release sur-
p us energy.

The chamber of commerce provided
‘unds for signs and the city park de-
fllrtment cooperated to see that these
were located on the main highway so
that all traffic could be directed to one
central park where the program for
tourists would be tried. The recreation
department called upon their trained
playground specialists to devise pro-
grams which could accommodate these
Iisitors at any time.

First, one person was designated to
meet the tourists as they parked, intro-
duce themselves and to invite the chil-
dren to take part in our program. In
one section of the park we might have
a story hour or a music hour, or maybe
a softhall game was in progress, or hoys
were shooting baskets on the basketball
courts, or the craft instructor had a
class in woodwork or plaster of Paris

When Gene Hansen and his family went on cross-country trips, he
spent lots of time looking for places where he could stop and let his
children play and relax from the confinement of the automobile. He had
a hard time finding such places. 50, when he returned, he went to his
city manager and local chamber of gommerce with a proposition for Grand

Junction—which is on the main highways.

The summer of 1952 saw the start of this program. Twenty-four states
were represented in the registrations of children. Parents looked up the
city manager, chamber of commerce secretary, recreation director, to
thank them. The story of the new venture is presented here.

 

molding, or one of the teachers was
teaching a tap dance or folk dance class,
or the visitors liked to play badminton
or ping-pong, or maybe the little tots
would slip into a bathing suit and cool
off in the wading pool. In the evening
from 7:00 to 9:00 on special occasions
we had free movies and some other
special attraction such as a pet show or

a doll show.

Each visitor was made to feel at home,
and suggestions were made to direct
them to one of the activities. From
then on they became a part of the pro-
gram for the day.

,.The use of the picnic tables and the
outside grill was also free for the
visitors.

At the end of the season, we had re-
ceived comments of gratitude from al-
most every state in the Union and from
foreign lands. Of course, all of these

comments were favorable.

If we have some improvements to
make, which we always have, they
might be to work closely with our cham-
ber of commerce and provide informa-
tion about our area which might be of
interest, and also to call attention to
any special recreation attraction which
might attract the tourists in the evening.

Since we live in a community of less
than 25,000 pe0ple, we prohably are
spared some of his administrative prob-

lems of a large city; and this program
might become a determent to a com-
munity’if the leaders did not have the
control of the participants in the park.
Every community will have to adjust
this program so as to guard against
offending the visitors.

The next time you take a trip, notice
how you welcome an invitation to use
the parks for a rest for yourself as an
adult as well as for your children.

Imagine, if you will, a network of
recreation programs across the nation.
We in recreation could hand together
and sell recreation by just selling our
local communities on the importance of
Opening our hearts and sharing our
blessings with other people as they
travel on their vacation.

Tourists will spend enough money in
your area to pay back whatever addi-
tional money you must budget to help
offset the costs of instruction and ma-
terials. Many visitors will remain -an
extra day just to follow up some interest
of their children which originated in
the park.

If this idea appeals to you, may we
suggest that you begin by joining hands
with the recreation department near
you and direct attention to the next
“WELCOME TOURIST PARK PRO-
GRAM” on any chosen route across the

T HE last eight years have seen a great increase in the num
ber of hospitals forming departments of recreation 0
providing a recreational program for their patients. The
increased use of recreation is reassuring to the leaders in
the recreation field. It shows that recreation is being in
creasingly understood and accepted. Today, there seem to
be three levels at which hospital recreation programs ar.
functioning. First, there is the type of program that get
people together with the chief objective being fun an:
amusement; second is the “activity catharsis” recreati01
program, built around the specific needs of the individua
and group, with activities that are selected on the basis 0
these needs; and third is the program that does not operat:
as a separate entity but which, primarily, works through th.
pe0ple who are members of the group to be considered. Thi
last type attempts to strengthen the basic skills of th:
natural leaders so that they are more capable of administer
ing for the total needs of the person and of the group.

Recreation as Amusement and Activity

The “fun” type of recreation program in the hospital i:
often divided into two parts: amusement, and activity. There
are the parties, professional entertainment, movies, and TV
which are the chief attractions. These are interspersed witl
routine activities such as puzzles and pre-designed craft worl
to keep the patients occupied or “busy” in between. This
level is well illustrated by the recent publication Starting c
Recreation Progi'am in a Civilian H ospital.1 About half the
pamphlet instructs the neophyte on how to have successfu'
parties (the choice of prizes and refreshments being very
important) and how to secure the necessary equipment foo
the programs. The section on “The Well-Rounded Recrea
tion Program” begins with parties and games, and is fol
lowed by entertainment, holiday activities and special events
(still parties), contests, and movies.

The leadership at this level is usually of the direct type.
Programs are planned for or with the patients and are
fitted into an over-all recreation schedule. In children’s hose
pitals, where the patients are less capable of planning, the
activities may come about at designated times each day
and the parties are put on for the children. At recreation
time the leader or volunteer is present and takes a very active
part in directing and assisting with the activities. The
programs are built, probably, around the ideas, suggestions,
enthusiasm, and available time of the leader.

Rccrcation as Expression

The activities in the therapeutic type of recreation, the
second level in the outline, may not look very different
externally than programs at the“ first level. But there are
important differences. They are selected on the basis of their
potential therapeutic value in meeting the individual’s (or
the group’s) needs. This difference in orientation and ob-
j ectives cannot always be seen from the activities. Programs

HOSpital, National Recreation Association, 1952. $1.00.

RECREATION

that are creative, imaginative, and self-initiated, and that
are carried on with less directive leadership, are found at
this level. This type of recreation is regarded as a regular
hospital service. It may be requested by staff members in
the same way as a blood test or an X-ray. The activities that
are planned in terms of the individual patient’s needs may be
individual- or group-type in nature.

The director of these activities is an integral member
of the hospital team. He works closely with the physician,
nurse, social worker, and psychiatrist. He plans his pro-
grams around their knowledge and they take into considera-
tion his reports. His program is a planned part of the
patient’s hospitalization and rehabilitation (social and per-
haps physical in character).

In these guided individual or group activities the patient
is helped to express himself and his needs in the hospital.
Hopefully, they will assist him in satisfying these emotional
needs, in adjusting to this new and challenging experience,
and to help him have successful and satisfying social rela-
tionships with other patients and members of the hospital
staff. The program, on careful examination, shows some of
these objectives in its selection and use of activities. Activi-
ties that are unstructured (no obvious or predetermined goal
or method of function) and that lend themselves to emo-
tional expression are selected. For children this may include
activities such as modeling, with no finished products or adult
guides, dramatic or make believe play, finger painting, or
games that are spontaneous and have no set patterns or
rules. The program for adults is more likely to be centered
around individual hobbies, group games, impromptu plays
along the lines of charades, discussions, arts and crafts, and
other social group activities. These programs help to make
the patient’s stay in the hospital more relaxing and con-
structive.

Creative “Patient-centered” Recreation

In the third and last category, the hospital recreation
department is interested in establishing an atmosphere con-
clucive to patient growth and development on both the indi-
vidual and group level; and in utilizing and improving the
leadership that is present within the basic hospital group.
This group is composed of the patients and the nurses with
whom they have continuous contact. Thus, the actual par-
ticipation of the patients in activities is of relatively minor
interest. No recreational service as such is provided—that
is, no activities are set up for the patients to choose among.
Thc recreation leaders are available, however, to provide
therapy, counseling, or consultation if it is desired.

What are the basic objectives of this level of recreation
and how is it more successful in meeting them than the
other two levels? To understand this we must review briefly
the hospital situation. A patient in the hospital needs to be
accepted, to be approved of, and to be given a chance to be
himself. In many hospitals where formality, rigid routine,
and authoritarian direction are found this is quite difficult
to achieve. Recreation, aside from attacking the structure

FEBRUARY 1954

that perpetuates these methods, can assist in counteracting
the harmful effects by meeting the emotional, social, and
psychological needs of the individual. The patient may
also need help in adjusting to this theatening and terrifying
experience. Above all, the hospital experience should be
such that the patient will need as little readjustment as pos-
sible when he returns to normal life.

These objectives can be most successfully met through
people and situations that are friendly and acccpting, that
provide room for individuality, and are in accord with
normal, “average” living patterns. Reviewing the recrea-
tion programs that cater to and patronize the individual
with frequent parties, entertainment, and so on, it can be
seen that they do not meet this‘objective in that they are
not in accord with usual, home-life conditions. The sol-
icitous prizes, gifts, and refreshments that are often needed
to artificially sustain these activities fall into the same
category. Competition is not as basic or as necessary a part
of life as is cooperation (which would be more worthwhile
to stress).

An analysis of the emotional and independent needs of
the patient suggests that recreational activities should be
selected by the patient and that these activities should pro-
vide ample room for creative expression and self-realiza-
tion. This certainly implies that many activities, especially
the “time consumers,” commonly seen in many hospitals
require a great deal of modification.

Sarason has pointed out that in light of recent studies
by Schaefer-Simmern a reorientation to occupational therapy
is indicated.2 The activities where the individual does not
receive satisfaction from his own realization of improve-
ment, it is pointed out, will not have worthwhile therapeutic
effects. “. . . the patient may attain control over his hands,
he may become so used to this occupation that he is able to
execute it without personality participation in it, he may even
feel at ease in doing it, but the compulsory attention and
concentration repeated over and over will throw him into
a mental and emotional rigidity worse than before.”3 The
patient may become adept" at making things but his personal
relationship to them remains external if the activity does not
reflect himself. “. . . only when the innermost core of interest
voluntarily determines the applying of one’s energies, when
one feels that the work being done is an indispensable part of
oneself, and when one is aware that attention and conccntra-
tion are indispensable in order to realize pneself—only then
does work become constructive.”4

To be sure this writer would not go as far as to say that
there are no non-self-originated activities that have value.
Obviously, there are many limited participation and spec-
tator-type activities that are very valuable, especially for the
patient with limited physical activity. The point is, simply,
that it should not be thought that because a person is busy

(New York: Harper 8: Bros., 1949). pp. 320-1.

with an activity it does not matter what that activity is, that
it is helping to rehabilitate him, or that the staff is doing
an effective job. This is as naive as the lay person who
believes the hospital recreation worker merely entertains
the patients and helps them to pass the heavy-hanging time.

The second area of objectives centers about making a
patient’s hOSpital stay of the maximum positive value. This
involves an opportunity to grow mentally and mature emo-
tionally. This is particularly important for children, who are
missing school and essential “growing up” experiences while
in the hOSpital, and long term patients. A well-rounded pro-
gram should provide real learning experiences of social,
educational, and intellectual nature. The assumption at
this level is that people are capable of doing it themselves
if they are provided with the proper situation. Peeple cannot
be coerced or directed *to get something out of a recreation
program. They must personally feel the need for it, do it
themselves, and see their own progress if they are going to
get anything out of it. The best way to produce learning is
to provide a stimulating and accepting atmosphere. If this
is done the person will do the rest. And, of course, we want
recreation to be in accord with the principles of democratic
living.

The third level of recreation is centered about the patient.
It is not leader-centered or hospital-centered. A paramount
emphasis is to provide this accepting and stimulating at-
mosphere where the patient and group can relax and pre-
pare to help themselves. This cannot be done solely by the
recreation department. Consequently, one of its most im-
portant tasks is to work with the nurses and other hospital
staff involved. The nurses are an essential aspect of this
program because they have the primary relationship with
the patients—together they form the basic hospital group.
A cardinal principle of nursing is that the nurse provides for
all the needs of the patient. She nurses the patient’s mind and
body for, to be sure, these cannot be separated. This includes
the patient’s emotional and recreational needs. Nursing
in these terms is in the very best interest of the patient. It
is the aim of the patient-centered recreation staff to deve10p
and utilize the nurse’s skill and leadership to strengthen her
relationship with the patients. The nurse is the most logical
focal point for an integration of patient treatments. This
approach counteracts specialization and competition; it
works for the complete cooperation and consolidation of the
staff’s effort on the patient’s behalf.

The Need for Objectives

Some programs are like a merry-go-round; there is fun,
noise, excitement and laughter but it stops right where it
started—you get off where you got on. To keep a program
from going in circles the basic needs of peeple must be con-
sidered and provided for in a satisfying fashion. A recrca-
tion program must determine its objectives and have them
clearly in mind if it is to be of genuine value to its partici-
pants. Patient-centered, creative recreation is an attempt to
do this in the most productive and worthwhile fashion for
the patient and indirectly, then, for those hOSpitals where
the individual patient is the foremost concern.

86

Q

The Training of Leaders

One further question that perhaps comes up at this point
is the training of hospital recreation leaders. It might be
asked if creative, patient-centered type leaders require
any specialized training beyond the usual requirements.
The answer to this seems to be: N 0, he just needs an under-
standing of the objectives mentioned in this area. This
definitely suggests, however,’ a greater concern for ability
in human relations and less interest in activity-skill ability.
That the recreation leader in the hOSpital may be a student
of any one of several different fields is an unmistakable
sign of progress in recreation. Professional training in edu-
cation (administration, guidance, or Special education),
psychology (educational, clinical, or social), group dy-
namics, mental health, social group work, recreation, re-
habilitation, or physical and health education are all pos-
sibilities. It is quite conceivable that any one of these—but
more hopefully a combination—would provide the necessary
background.

Hospital Recreation Is on the Move

The above summary illustrates the different levels at which
hosPital units are working today. To determine how much
progress is taking place in the field, it would be necessary
to know what develOpments have been made in recent years
in all the different hospital units across the continent.
Nevertheless, several definitely encouraging signs can be
seen. Standards in the profession are relatively high—com-
parable, say, to the teaching profession. Recreation is moving
into many different kinds of hospitals across the United
States. A good beginning also is being made in Canada.
In the last five years the writing in the field has easily
doubled. Several universities are, now offering a program
for prospective hospital recreation workers. In the state
hospitals of Minnesota, the program supervisor, who has
a recreation background, is the coordinator of the non-
medical therapy program in the hOSpital. As such he is
the administrative director of the occupational therapy
program. This should eliminate any controversy concerning
the overlapping of services. The broadening of the field in
this instance marks another step of progress for recreation.

Advancement can be detected, indirectly, in the change
in emphasis from activity skill to. indirect and effective
leadership. Even a superficial survey of hospital recreation
departments shows a great number well advanced in the
above three-stage outline. A comparison with the general
field of recreation would show, it is believed, the high attain-
ment of this special branch.

The most serious handicap to growth in hospital recrea-
tion is the lack of understanding by the hOSpital workers
themselves, their administrators, and the community. This
may mean that the leaders need to broaden and deepen their
knowledge in this area and educate their fellow workers.
It also may suggest a renewed effort to define the work and
basic objectives and then turn around and effectively inter-
pret them to the public. This would lay a foundation for
even greater progress and would keep hospital recreation

“on the move.”

RECREATION

EECREATION therapy is a compara-

tivel.y new field in the realm of
mental hygiene. Many pe0ple do not
have any conception of what it is.
liecreation therapy in a state hospital
is the prescribed use of exercise, mass
games, individual and dual sports,
dancing and social activities to aid
mentally ill people in rehabilitation and
social adjustment.

In the course of a program of rec-
reation therapy, opportunities are pro-
vided for organized and free play. For
the majority of patients, the program
begins with free play. This involves
giving participating patients various
articles of athletic equipment and allow-
ing them to use these for their own
kinesthetic pleasure in movement under
proper supervision. From free play
therc comes increased neuro-muscular
coordination and control with a usual
development of motivation into more
organizcd activities which might in-
clude softball, volleyball, touch foot-
hall, dancing, singing, dramatics, and
so on.

v A variety of activities are available
to enable the therapist to meet indi-
vidual desires and needs. Such a varied
program presents the patient with an
opportunity to select a new activity,
' obtain a
breadth of deveIOpment. In particular,
for patients who have not known suc-
cess in spccific areas and are afraid to
attempt an activity because of these pre-
vious failures, it is necessary for the
physician with the therapist, when pos-
siblck—through interviews and observa-

tions—to determine activities into
which the patient can be directed so as
to aid in his rehabilitation.

These activities must be presented on
a progressive level, as experience shows
that the attractiveness of an activity is
determined, not only by past experience
of success or failure, but also by the
expcctation of future success. It is of the
utmost importance to recognize this
fact, so that activities may begin with
basic skills and work into complex
skills. This progression will condition
the patient, while developing his self-
confidence.

It is necessary that the recreation
therapist establish rapport with the

patient at the basic skill level and

develop this rapport as the patient
moves progressively towards the more
complex skills. Without the proper
supervision and leadership the patient’s
performance will be haphazard, unor-
ganized and the possibility of progress-
ing into complex skills greatly dimin-
ished.

Recreation is a natural activity en-
gaged in during leisure time.'There is
.a transfbr,of this naturalness into rec-
reation therapy which offers an oppor-
tunity of pleasant activity; at the same
time, it improves mental and organic
health, and aids in releasing mental
tension by a redirection of attention
and the use of excess energy. The ac-
tivity aids mental growth by increasing

87

an individual’s experiences and allow-

ing the patient to meet the desire for
social interaction. He is placed in a

pleasant situation wherein he can
develop one or several interests in
activities, in himself, and in other par-
ticipating patients of the group.

It is important to recognize that rec-
reation activities can be used therapeu-
tically by prescription in working with
the individual and working with groups.
Therapeutic treatment through mixed-
group activities allows for a more
natural and community-like atmos-
phere.

The original motivation will usually
be extrinsic, having been started by the
therapist. But the consistency of the
activity will start intrinsic activity and
initiative by offering a goal, which may
be the acquirement of a basic skill, self-
improvement, or the winning of an
activity. These goals must be within the
patient’s grasp; and with the planning
of a diversity of activities such goals
can be set high or low enough so that
each individual will experience success.

When a patient meets with success
once he will cultivate and increase his
interests. With this increase comes the
greater opportunity for socialization.
Specific examples:

1. A patient who hegins by playing
catch. We begin with him where his
regression has left him, increasing his
proficiency, working with the therapist,
where there is social interaction between
only two persons. Once he reaches a cer-
tain degree of proficiency and self-

confidence he is able to move into a
group playing catch and from there into
organized games of ball which offer
more social interaction.

2. A patient is taken into a begin-
ners’ class of dancing. He is then taught
to walk to the different basic rhythms
of waltz, fox-trot, and rhumba. From
this he progresses to each rhythmic
basic step after which, with practice, his
proficiency and self-confidence in-
crease so that he is able to participate in
the more social dance activities.

Frequently the recreation therapists
outline the program for the patients in
the large mass activities. In these, it is
not possible to meet the individual needs
of the participants as well as in the
smaller groups. Recognizing this fact,
we organized a representative com-
mittee with members from the female
and male Treatment Center wards to
organize, plan, and decorate for their
dance.

This was the first patient-activity
planning group in recreation therapy at
Camarillo State Hospital Treatment
Center. The committee held several
meetings during which they planned
the decorations, program, and refresh-
ments. On the day of the dance they
decorated the Recovery Room for the
coming affairs.

At the dance itself, committee mem-
bers acted as hostesses and hosts, in-
troducing patients to one another and
encouraging them to participate. Be-
cause of the size of the committee and

their intimate relationships with pa-

{‘

tients there were more active partici-
pants than usual. The committee also
conducted the serving of refreshments.
Several patients were heard to remark
that this was just like being at home
or at a community party.

The idea of patient committees is
excellent. It hrings the activity much
closer to all the patients. It also affords
an opportunity for leadership and group
teamwork among them. But most of all,
it allows the patients opportunities to
channel their self-expression, project
themselves into their own selection of
activities, and it affords more of an in-
group feeling that it is their activity
and for them. ‘

Recreation therapy gives the patient
values and activities that are of a carry-
over nature. There is the security, in
leaving the hospital, of being able to
join the activities of the local com-
munity. No other therapy offers as
valuable a carry-over program of social
activity as does recreation therapy.

There is still much experimental work
to be initiated in this new area. Even
in its infancy it has proven its worth in
aiding the mentally ill to become well
and return to their communities.

Volunteer Recreation Service

From the Illinois Recreation Association Bulletin, June 1953.

A suggestion was made to a group of
senior high school Girl Scouts, in Pekin,
to organize a volunteer recreation ser-
vice to aid parents with grade school
children’s home-party games. This idea
appealed to them and a High School
Girl Scout Recreation Troop was
formed.

The girls meet once a week in the
high school building and are trained in
simple fundamentals of how to conduct

88

successful r younger children’s social
parties. A party game course is con-
ducted by the superintendent of recrea-
tion and the public school physical ed-
ucation supervisor. Each week several
different games are selected and played
by the troop in order that the girls may
have full knowledge of every game they
are to include in their various party
programs.

Two or three of these girls from the

troop are then available on request by
parents who wish to have aid in their
home parties. Requests, which are made
to the playground and recreation office,
have come from some of the parents as
well as from the parent-teachers school
organizations and from fraternal or-
ganizations. While members of these
organizations are in sessions, the Girl
Scouts take care of the children with
various recreation games.

A RECREATION CENTER FOR THE AGING

“The artist circle created quite a hubbub
with a grand finale painting party, their final
fling before suspending their textile painting
periods for the summer . . . Quite a few of
Birmingham’s ‘artists’ are neat, over-sixty-

I'year-old ladies who stroll down to the Central
City Community House for a session with the

ipaint brushes every Tuesday.”—Birmingham
Post-Herald, June 1, 1953.

THE above quote from a local news-
. paper refers to one of the activities
of the successful day center established
in a large housing development in the
IBirmingham, Alabama, metrOpolitan
area. The register of this development
reveals approximately four hundred
residents of over sixty years of age.

The center has been established under
the sponsorship of the Junior Woman’s
Civic Club, as a part of a carefully
planned gerontology project based on
local needs.

The way in which this was organized
|and started suggests initial procedures
for other such groups. With the club
membership overwhelmingly in favor
of the undertaking, the problem at hand
was to determine the most advantageous
location for such a center and to map
plans for its inception. A meeting of
club representatives was called and in-
cluded a representative of the Extension
Service of the University of Alahama,
which institution has been very aware
of the pressing need for help to the
aging; a representative of the Co-
ordinating Council of Social Forces, to
serve in an advisory capacity, since
no municipal or community funds were
available for this work; Alyce Billings
Walker of the Birmingham News, whose
knowledge of the situation was very

helpful.

From this meeting, and several to

follow, came the decision that a rec-
reation day center be established at
Central City, and that this project be
a pilot study for future organizations
desiring to assist in community service
of this nature. The University of Ala-
bama cooperated to the extent of ar-
ranging and presenting a five-week
seminar. The cost to club members was

$3.00 for each who attended, the re-
maining ,expense being defrayed by

the university. At this seminar, our _

membership was indoctrinated in the
psychological, physiological, biological
and sociological aspects of aging, and
were better equipped to understand the
problems to be encountered.

Throughout our initial planning we
used as a guide the Hodson Community
Center in New York, which has been
operating successfully for several years.
A member of the Junior Woman’s Civic
Cluh visited Hodson and brought back
a detailed report.

During the latter part of the summer
of 1952 our club undertook a survey
of all residents of Central City over
sixty years of age, under the supervision
and direction of the Coordinating
Council of Birmingham. A form was
provided with carefully selected ques-
tions regarding the recreational wishes
"of the pe0ple interviewed, and whether
they would be interested in a recreation
center. After the survey was completed
a representative group from those inter-
viewed was invited to meet with our
advisory committee to guide us in se-
lecting a recreation program which
would be acceptable and workable. It
was decided following this meeting, and
upon the expert advice of those who had
worked in similar centers, that we would
be well advised to limit our activities
in the beginning to simple games and

 

to provide light refreshments; and then,
to let the people attending suggest their
own program activities.

The center opened with a tea in De-
cember, 1952. All of the Central City
residents over sixty who had been inter-
viewed were sent invitations. The Bir-
mingham newspapers were most co-
operative in publicizing our project,
and we were very pleased that about
one hundred visitors attended.

Since that time the day center for
the aging has been in operation. It is
under the direction and supervision of
a board of ten members elected and/or
appointed from the membership of the
Junior Woman’s Civic Club, and is
operated by volunteer members of this
club. Financing is done with the funds
raised by the club’s annual benefit “It’s
A Party.”

The center was open from 10:00 AM.
to 2:00 PM. twice .weekly through May
1953, but during the summer months it
curtailed its operation to one day a
week. On the first of September,
activities were expanded to three days a
week. In the first eight months of Opera-
tion, “Sunset Unlimited” day center had
an attendance of 1,764» from a memher-
ship of approximately 130 persons over
sixty; and volunteer workers had given
a total of 936 hours.

The painting party mentioned in the
newspaper is only one of the many
activities that have evolved to date.
Among others are crafts, bridge and
canasta parties, other games, use of a
lending library, and a picnic.

How to effectively mobilize on-campus leisure in colleges and universities.

RECREATIHN in the

Educational Process

THE use of leisure by students in the
modern college confronts administra-

tions with a fundamental issue which
lies close to the heart of the educational
process. How do students spend their
time in these hours when, free from the
exacting discipline of work controlled
hy academic credit hours, they are at
liherty to do as they please? How are
the character and quality of student-
leisure activity related to personal
growth? What obligation falls upon a
college to provide opportunity to en-
courage the deve10pment of well-
founded educated judgments about the
use of leisure? What responsibility lies
upon institutions to provide facilities
and programs? How is leisure activity
balanced with academic work in a pat-
tern designed to equip the young man
and woman with mature habits of en-
joyment? The question of campus lei-
sure stands as one of the areas demand-
ing further explanation in the theory
and practice of higher education. How

ment of Recreation Personnel.

can policies be deve10ped which will

lead to free-time experiences which are
genuinely satisfying to the student and
at the same time contribute positively
to the educational goals of the institu—
tion? A student carrying fifteen credit
hours of academic work, and allowing
two hours class preparation for each,
has something like a forty-five hour
work-week. He then has left something
like an average of four hours a day of
free time and much of this is concen-
trated over the week-end period.
Students temper the selection of
leisure activities, in many instances, in
terms of their points of view or atti-
tudes. They undertake activity which
seems to them satisfying and such pat-

tern may appear to others sometimes

to move counter to the educational ob-
jectives of the institution itself. What
leisure-time opportunities students do
not find to their satisfaction on the
campus, they will seek and find else-
where- At any one time this free-time
participation may appear to run the
gamut from the very desirable to un-
desirable activities. Because of the latter
kind, many administrators feel that
restrictions and limitations must be
effected. Administrative restraint, how-

ever, very often does not change the
outlook of students or redirect their
leisure activities into different outlets.
Hence an analysis of what recreation
means provides a realistic approach to
the explanation of the role of leisure
in the educational process.

Within the framework of the college
environment, recreation becomes an ac-
tivity participated in after study and
the other academic demands of college
life have been fulfilled. Within the re-
maining free time, students develop “on
their own” a pattern of activity which
tends to become a student folkway. It
is this leisure-time pattern of activity
over which the modern college may
have very little effective control. Per-
haps this is a fortunate circumstance
because the quality of an institution’s
influence upon the life habits of its
students may well he indicated by
what they do when they can do as they
please.

During the time which is at his dis-
posal, free from the academic compul-
sion of the institution, a student has a
wide range of activities, from which to
select. These run from quasi-academic
through co- or extra-curricular, com-
munity to commercialized activities.

RECREATION

 

How do students spend their free hours? Increasingly, eolleges. are pro-
viding programs beyond pattern of mere activity. (University of Minnesota)

How does the modern college go
about attempting to meet the leisure
demands of its students? What does
it do when it is confronted with the
need for offering a socially acceptable
program which may not coincide with
the desires of students and which in-
deed at times may be at odds with their
own folkways and inclinations? What
is the college to do when the attractive-
ness of some commercialized diversions
tends to work at cross purposes with
the recreation program offered by the
institution? In such a perspective the
goal of educating students to use leisure
in a worthwhile manner becomes acute.
The seriousness of the problem is often
magnified because the few students who
stand out as deviates receive much more
publicity than the majority of students.
To some extent they set in motion
counter-forces which tug adversely at
the educational purposes of institutions
of higher learning. Basic thinking needs
to be and is being done about utilizing
leisure as a functional factor in higher
education. The maximum educational
benefit results when the leisure-time
program is encouraged by administra-
tive attitudes, policies, and resources.

FEBRUARY 1954

Increasingly, colleges are providing
programs which go beyond the pattern
of mere activity. Such programs aim
to provide students with the opportunity
to share in experiences which are not
only satisfying but are also significant
because they provide avenues for phy-
sical, mental, spiritual, and emotional
experiences.

There is reason to believe that the
use of recreational facilities varies
directly with their availability. When
colleges consider recreation as one of
the functions of student life, they use
it to support the educational purposes
of the institution.

Student’s Leisure-Time Dilemma

Since no two institutions are alike
and each pursues its own unique ap-
proach, the recreation offerings on
various campuses differ. No single pat-
tern of recreational activity is adapt-
able to all institutions. From an organi-
zational standpoint, however, there are
certain situations which seem to be
common to many.

Perhaps the first of these is that rec-
reational offerings are often highly de-

centralized and independently con-

ducted by many departments and
agencies. The larger the institution the
more complex this condition tends to
become. In most colleges the minimum
number of organizations having free-
time programs include the physical edu-
cation department, the music depart-
ment, the dramatic department, the resi-
dence halls, the religious organizations,
and the social clubs such as fraternities
and sororities. Increasingly student
unions offer varied and extensive oppor-
tunities for recreation.

In the face of such diverse oppor-
tunities the student often becomes be-
wildered and wonders in which direc-
tion he should turn. Desirable activities
may occur simultaneously. College
events to which the student has a loyalty
may conflict. At other times there may
be gaps of time in which the student
finds it diflicult to find a recreational
activity available to his mood and in-
clination.

Again, the student may find himself
the victim of another diHiculty: campus
organizations may actually compete for
students by offering activities of quite
similar and overlapping nature. Under
such circumstances the student is tugged
this way and that, not for his own good,
but for the purposes of the group which
solicits and manipulates him. Residence
halls, religious organizations, depart-
mental societies, and so on, may bring
pressure to bear upon the student to
participate as a representative of the
particular organization. At times the
activities may not even interest the stu-
dent, yet because of a compulsion tied
to group loyalty or religious allegiance,
the student submits. Under such cir-
cumstances his participation ceases to
be recreation. His leisure program is
torn asunder by demands made upon
him. Competition among the depart-
ments of the college often becomes in-
tense as each seeks the participation of
as many students as possible merely to
magnify the importance of the depart-
ment or some office thereof.

Caught in this dilemma, the student
does not make his choice freely in such
a way as to establish a sound basis for
making intelligent leisure choices in
the future. The resultant situation is
paradoxical. 0n the one hand the insti-
tution seeks through an integrated cur-
riculum to develop educated citizens

91

who have a sound basis for making ob-
jective and educated judgments; on
the other hand, the leisure program is,
more often than not, neither integrated
nor coordinated. Students are appealed
to from all sides on an emotional plane.
Little wonder then that many of them
leave college with poorer leisure habits
than when they entered!

Principles For Organizing Campus
Recreation

From a study of the conditions of
recreation on American college cam-
puses, which may mildly be called
chaotic, it appears possible to effect
order in a way which will contribute to
the growth and personal satisfaction of
the student as a mature person. Such an
order must be soundly built upon the
foundation at the point where recrea-
tion is planned. Since each campus en-

Vironment presents a peculiar and
unique problem, there is a need for the
establishment of sound principles of
general applicability to any college
situation. A growing body of research
now makes it possible to formulate
some of these principles.

First, a campus recreation program
must be designed to meet the needs of
the students in their college environ-
ment. Although the students comprise
the chief body of potential participants
to which the program is directed, the
design should include in its conception
administrative ochers, faculty and staff
members, and off-campus community
groups. It is unrealistic to View the stu-
dents as an isolated group. A program
which is solely directed to students ig-
nores other forces which play a domi-
nant role in influencing their leisure ac-
tivities. To think of and plan for the

college as an entity in itself indicates
a lack of awareness of the environment
which the institution operates.

Second, a campus recreation program
should be student-centered. The major
purpose of any college lies in its pro-
gram brought to focus on the whole
education of the whole student. Because
campus recreation is one functional
part of such a whole program, it too
must be student-centered. While such
a statement does not imply that all other
groups are ignored, it does mean that
the campus recreation program be-
comes satisfying to students to the ex-
tent that the core resides in the students
and all other develOpments stem from
that core.

Third, democratic representation of
the participant interest is basic to the
mobilization of egective campus recrea-

RECREATION

:ampus recreation the principle should
be inviolately adhered to that the
groups involved should share in the
alanning of the activities in which they
Ire expected to participate. Obviously
.his means a strong representation from
student groups. The college administra-
ion, faculty, and staff, however, must
share in the policy formation because
Iny good or bad consequence of the
Drogram will reflect upon them. Off-
iampus community groups may either
pave representation or be called upon
’or valuable consultation.

Fourth, college administrators must
ievelop a clear and coherent policy on
:arnpus recreation. The campus recrea-
Ition program requires leadership, finan-
:es, facilities, equipment, space and
Ieheduling. The provisions and alloca-
.ions of these requirements depend
.Ipon the policy established by the ad-
lninistration. Sanction can only come
when the administration fully under-
stands the impact which functional
eisure programs may have in the total
development of the student.

Fifth, an effective campus recreation
arogram requires qualified professional
'eadership responsible for the compre-
iensive leisure activities of the whole
Hurlent body- This means that some col-
ege officer must function and coordi-
nate recreational activities. It does not
mean that the initiative of various de-
partments and agencies should be
stifled. 1t 1nerely implies that the most
practical means by which to schedule
and conduct campus recreation exists
when attention is focused on the needs
of the students rather than upon the
sponsoring group. Such a recreation
:oordinator must hold a position in the
iollege administrative line which makes
r impossible for departmental or agency
.hairmen to block the program. In many
colleges a campus recreation eoordi-
nator responsible directly to the dean
of students seems most advisable.

The Potential

It appears, therefore, that good cam-
pus recreation must be securely rooted
in good organization. Colleges will find
it increasingly necessary to provide a
qualified recreation officer thoroughly
familiar with education and college ad-
Ininistration. Such an ollicer organizes
he free-time student activity into the

whole educational program of the insti-.
tution. The full use of facilities, areas,
equipment, and other recreation re-
sources on the campus depends upon
competent planning by an imaginative
coordinator. Under the leadership of

When recreation receives the official

such a person any duplication, waste,
competition, and chaos in college ree-
reation will diminish. The office of the
coordinator can well provide such ser-
vices as consultation on leisure prob-
lems, the maintenance of a clearing
house for recreation information, and
the stimulation of activities in neglected
program areas. By locating the respon-
sibility for campus recreation in a single
authority the college administration
will discover that more effective efforts
and educational benefits will result. Rec-
reation will no longer exist as an or-
phan responsibility. Rather it will be
the real concern of a qualified leader
operating in terms of a clear policy.

 

time. The potential for providing de-
sirable social education is unlimited.
In fact, in no other college-sponsored
program does there exist equal oppor-
tunities for interpersonal relationships.
In campus recreation, program les-
sons about learning to live in a society
are present on every hand. By the es-
stablishment of clear administrative
policies, the location of line authority
for professional leadership, and abund-
ant provision for student participation
at all levels of planning and perform-
ance, recreation in colleges will come of
age and channel one of the greatest
forces for educationalgrowth into posi-
tive and student-satisfying directions.

One of a series of radio talks, given by the Institute for

Human Adjustment at the University of Michigan, on prob-
lems that confront older-age groups, was concerned with this
topic. The substance of this radio dialogue is presented here.

A S we grow older it is often possible
to continue activities which we en-
joyed as younger people, providing of
course that we make the necessary modi-
fications to take account of changes in
our physical energies and capacities.

In American life, great emphasis is
put upon the value of sports, and in-
terest in them persists throughout
maturity. We urge people to deve10p
skills and interests which they can use
throughout life, and yet we know that
certain changes come with age which
must be taken into account.

The oldster in sports must learn that
he is not a youngster. If he will keep
this in mind he can sensibly adapt his'
play to his years and continue to be
active in sports; but the amount of play
and the intensity of play must likewise
be tempered with wisdom.

During the last century, America has
changed from a largely rural agricul-
tural society to an urban industrialized
society. We live in smaller homes, we
are no longer closely knit, self-sufficient
families. As the pace of our living has
speeded up with the industrial and
machine age, so the chances of one’s
finding exercise in one’s work has de-
creased. However, our human machine
evolved through exercise, and it needs
continued exercise in order to keep fit.
We need exercise for the sake of unused
muscles and for the sake of thwarted

tology in the Institute for Human Ad-
justment, and DR. MITCHELL is profes-

94

impulses. And, because exercise is not
found in our everyday push-button type
of work, we have to seek it and cultivate
it. Therein is the great interest in sports
—it acts as a compensation for the exer~
cise and satisfaction that outdoor living
previously provided.

Sports are definitely related to physi-
cal fitness. The emphasis on strength
and endurance grows less with age; but,
to the contrary, the emphasis on mental
relaxation, poise, sociability, increases.
Sports provide a forgetfulness of the
day’s work and of worries; they help in
weight reduction provided one does not
eat too heavily afterwards; they help re-
duce blood pressure, most important
with older pe0ple. Older people need
forward-looking interests, otherwise
they tend to reminisce and to daydream.

Mental-hygiene workers today are
unanimous in stressing the values of
hobbies for older people. For one who
has worked hard all his life it is difficult
to adjust abruptly to a life of ease. One
cannot so quickly change a lifetime’s
habits. One must have interests to oc-
cupy one’s attention. These interests are
all the more valuable if they can be pu r-
sued with peeple. Otherwise the older
person gets a frustrated feeling that life
is finished for him, that he is useless,
that he is an encumbrance on his family
and society. New continuing'interests
help to give him a feeling of accom-
plishment and service.

As peeple become older they have
less energy and less endurance. One
might argue that exercise and sports
activities are likely to be harmful to
older pe0ple. I would agree to this for
the older person who has some serious
physical disability or is woefully out of

training. Moderation is the correcl
answer. For the person who has 1101
exercised vigorously for years, modera
tion would mean very mild exercise;
for the person who has exercised regu
larly, moderation could be safely geared
up to a much greater degree of exertion
Strength and endurance have to be con-
tinually maintained or they are lost

One must, therefore, keep exercising
to keep fit for more exercise; but ar
exercise program for the sake of fitness
can become boring unless there is a
strong motivation for it. You cannot
secure fitness for exercise and then be
through with your problem. In short.
physical fitness is not secured by the
mere attainment of it; it must be main
tained as well. There can, however, be
a tapering off in the amount of exer-
cise one needs after fitness is reached.

Speed events have absolutely no place
in the program of older peeple in sports.
Shy away from the sudden explosive
efforts of all-out speed, as in running.
The older person has more weight to
carry about, is less resilient, and his
reactions slow down for quick stepping
and starting. For long and even sus-
tained effort, however, where strength
and endurance rather than speed are

demanded, the older person in training
need not take a back seat. Witness the
trappers and hunters of long years and
grizzled appearance; witness the fish-
ing and mountain climbing guides; wit-
ness many of the famous distance
walkers, runners, and oarsmen, who,
even though no longer champions, can
rate a much superior performance to
most of their younger competitors!

The older athlete can maintain good
form in athletic execution even though
his performance may be lowered a little
because of reduced strength and endur-
ance or, possibly, eyesight. It must be
remembered that this axiom holds true:
Once acquired, skills are never lost even
though a period of years has elapsed
without their being used. Oldsters
underestimate their power of learning
new things. If an older person makes
up his mind to learn some new sport
skill and sticks to it, he can reach real
achievement. .

People discuss, with a good deal of
heat, the question as to whether or not
exercise shortens or lengthens a per-
son’s life. There is no use trying to be
decisive on this answer. We just don’t
know.There is no substantiated research
evidence, one way or the other. There
are many older people who argue that
they never exercise and are never sick.
That can be true when the person’s par-
ticular type of wor'k does not demand
any degree of physical exertion. In con-
trast with those sedentary individuals
who claim inactivity as the key to
longevity, we can point out individuals
like Alonzo Stagg coaching football at
eighty-seven, .Connie Mack managing a
major league baseball team at eighty-

definitely over for them—the dashes,
football, basketball, boxing, and the
like. If they train regularly, the strength

and endurance sports are still Open. The‘

skill sports, however, promise an invit-
ing field; and there are many of them—
to cite only a few: golf, bowling, tennis,
squash, badminton, skeet
shooting, skish (a casting game), swim-

archery,

ming, canoeing, skiing, sailing, and
fishing and hunting. For games like
tennis and squash, it is better to play as
doubles rather than singles, because the
amount of running is cut down. It is
good also to play in scoring games
where good players can team up with
weaker partners and still have an even
exciting match, as in golf. Bowling lends
itself to handicapping so that players of
differing abilities can team together and

still have fun. Also, the older person

can get a great deal of satisfaction by
giving advice to promising youngsters

sports programs in their communities.

The following list includes games and
Sports which are appropriate for dif-
ferent age levels. In considering these
activities, adjustments—merely com-
mon sense—should be made by older
people. The exercise should be exhilar-
ating, not fatiguing. When breathless-
ness comes, or when resiliency does not
return the next day, then the program
should be cut down. Nine holes of golf
instead of eighteen; a player of less
skill in tennis for an opponent; a shorter
walk or a shorter swim!

Model Plan‘

E have found, in Wichita, Kansas, that model flying has
W always been popular in the spring and summer months.
For the last few years, however, we have set up a program
of model plane flying Sunday afternoons in the Municipal
Forum, giving the model builders and flyers an opportunity
to carry on a year-round program. The indoor flying is
under the direction of the park board recreation department
and there is no cost to the model flyers. The winter schedule
runs through December, January, February and a part of
March, depending upon weather conditions.

As to contest rules, we follow mostly those set up by the
Academy of Model Aeronautics. Our department is for-
tunate in that Leo Rutledge, a park board supervisor, has had
wide experience in model building and flying. He also has
served on state and national model flying committees.

The flying isn’t limited to any age group. Several groups
consist of intermediate and high-sch'ool-age boys. 111 fact,
the program isn’t limited to boys because we do have girls
and occasionally women flyers. In several instances entire
families have competed in the flyingcontests.

At present we have no model plane building classes set
up in the schools, but for several years our department con-
ducted model building classes in the local high schools and
intermediate schools. We also set up a class in the boys’
detention home.

Probably one factor in model plane popularity, as far as
Wichita is concerned, is that we have several small aircraft
plants along with the large Boeing, Cessna and Beech air-
craft plants. In 1951 the air force constructed an air base

on the outer edge of the city. Air men from the local air base
have taken an active part in the model plane program, ust as
they have in the various other program activities, athletic
lcagues and tournaments.

Two outdoor areas have been set up for model plane use.
One area has lights for night flying. The flying circles have
been laid out away from picnic grounds and athletic fields.
It is very important that model plane flying is not permitted
in the same area in which softball and baseball are being
played. 'It is also necessary to construct a fence barrier‘to
prevent spectators from wandering into the flying circle.

Cood supervision is necessary in order to make sure that
all safety rules are strictly enforced. As model plane flying
can many times bring complaints from neighborhoods in
regard to noise, it is important to locate these fields away
from neighborhood or housing areas.

In setting up an indoor program in a school gy1nnasium
or similar building that has a finished floor, it is important to
see that oil spots are removed at once. We have found that
using squares of cardboard under all planes which are
warming up or being workcd upon will serve very satis-
factorily. Advance planning in setting up the program
before each meeting will help run the meets off in good order.
Whether an indoor or outdoor flying contest, it is very im-
portant to have a good public address system.

A few years ago one of the local aircraft plants presented
us with a generous pile of scrap balsa wood. The scraps
were not large enough to be very useful in craft projects. In
discussing probable use of the balsa with John Mahan, our
craft director, he suggested that possibly Leo Rutledge might
use this balsa wood in the beginners’ model building classes.

Many of the older groups naturally have gone into the

more advanced model building program. This type of build-
ing, of course, is rather expensive and the financing is largely
up to the individual builder.

Kite flying and construction at the playground each spring
probably help to interest the younger group in flying; and
also help to build interest in crafts. We have several large
scale models that we have used to demonstrate principles of
flying. You will note that the large kite, twelve feet by
sixteen feet, as illustrated, will draw a great deal of attention
from the youngsters on a playground. The making of para-

Each contestant will be given one hundred points
before takeoff.

Twenty points will be deducted if he should touch
the floor within the first quarter lap of his first lap
around the circle.

If contestant should fail to give clear signal before
attempting to land—his flight will be void and he will
be given no other chance. ’

If engine should die within first five laps because
of needle valve setting, contestant will automatically
be given another chance after everyone else has had
a turn.

A person in a winning position must have stopped
his plane on the carrier deck, the motor still running,
with his arrester hook caught on a hook line.

Ten points will be deducted for each attempt to

chutes, and the dropping of these from kites while in flight
is also exciting.

In 1951-52 the craft department distributed two thousand
sticks for beginning kite builders, most of which are broken
in practice flying before the regular meets. For several
years, we have conducted kite tournaments at each of our
twenty playgrounds. The winners on these playgrounds com-
pete in a city-wide tournament.

A few years ago we had several full size gliders con-
structed in our large downtown craft center. Some of these
had a wing spread of thirty feet, and were launched at the

municipal airport. I believe one landed somewhere in Ok-
lahoma. You will note from the glider picture that it takes
quite a bit of room to build such projects. For this reason
we have not encouraged glider construction as part of our
craft program—because we do not have sufficient space.

In summing up‘model plane flying, I would say that it
is a very fine recreation activity. It also can become a
hazard and a headache if it isn’t properly regulated and
supervised. You will reach many individuals through a

model plane program whom you would probably not reach
in any othcr recreation activity.

Teen-agers as postal clerks and delivery men operated the Valentine Post Offiee.

WHEN time draws near a special

holiday, every organization fre-
quented by children plans a party, but
what kind? Is it one with the usual
games, the usual prizes; or is it one
that’s different and not soon to be for-
gotten?

The teen-age club of the Parkland
Recreation Center, Operated by the city
division of recreation in Louisville,
Kentucky, recently sponsored a party
that was different indeed. When the girls
and boys gathered to discuss plans for
a Valentine celebration, they hit upon
the idea of a special delivery Valentine
mail service, replete with postmaster,
clerks, and delivery men.

But, of course, they first had to have
an office in which to Operate. And so a

“contractor” was appointed. Seventeen-
year-old Cleveland Sheilley, member of

the club, won the nomination. Setting '

busily about, Cleveland began “bid-
ding” for materials. First, he procured
two coca-cola bars; then, old scraps of
plywood from a near-by lumber yard:
nails from the crafts chest; and last of
all, yards of shiny silvered paper.
Placing the two bars end to end,
Cleveland formed the counter, fifteen
feet long, four feet high and two feet
wide, which served as the foundation.
Upon this, he constructed a window
service, replete with slots for mailing.
To the extreme left of the counter was
erected a shield, in which two windows
and two mail slots were cut, for informa-
tion and incoming mail services. To the
right side of this section was another
shield formed by a lattice work of ply-
wood strips placed over a solid panel
into which two windows and one slot

were cut, where outgoing mail was
handled. And there was a long, open
counter where the “mailmen” received
their deliveries.

The effect was quite realistic. The
only apparent difference, between this
and a regular office was the fancy decor
—the silver paper was used on the front
of the stand, with gold glittered cupids,
twisted swirls of red and white crepe
paper, and a midnight blue background
ablaze with twinkling red hearts.

The office was ready; the force
job. The postmaster
“barked” instructions; three girls —

,the clerks—busily sorted, by name,

nearly four hundred valentines. Some
they personally delivered through the
window; most they turned over to
two little, snappily “chapeaued” mail-
men who delivered the mail throughout
the center.

In the meantime, the eagerly awaiting
recipients played festive valentine
games and indulged in refreshments
of every description. The party was in-
deed a success, a tribute to the ingenious
minds of the club members.

The postal service was so popular that
the teen-agers are discussing plans to
set it up many times throughout the
year when it would be feasible and ap-
propriate: Easter, when baskets or eggs
can be delivered in like manner; a group
birthday celebration when congratula-
tory cards are in order; maybe even on
the Fourth of July—to exchange gifts
such as flags, historical novels, and so
on. “The entertainment value of the
project,” said Mrs. Jean Bocko, center
supervisor, “is priceless. even though

the cost can be measured in pennies.”

. . . .. “Know Your City” meetings,
held by the Phoenix City Council in the spring of 1953,
one question recurred time and time again: Where can
youngsters fly their model planes without being run off by
the police? The council turned over the solution of this
problem to the parks and recreation department.

A meeting was called by the recreation division of those
people who had shown an interest and a desire to see model
airplane flying in local neighborhoods. This group recom-
mended that:

A. A voluntary advisory committee of five members, one
of them to be a member of the recreation division stall,
be established by the parks and recreation department to
work out flying areas and times, and to recommend prac-
tices and policies for model airplane flying; that the com-
mittee’s recommendations be submitted to the superin-
tendent of the parks and recreation department or his,agent
and receive consideration in the same manner as other
policy matters; that is, they would, if necessary, be referred
through channels to the city council for final consideration.
One of the purposes of the committee would be to act as
liaison between model plane fliers and the public.

B. The Code of the City of Phoenix be revised or amended
to permit model planes with internal combustion engines,
not to exceed thirty-five hundredths cubic inch piston dis-
placement, to fly on designated areas at designated times
as regulated by the parks and recreation department.

Under this plan, the city would be divided into zones
and model planes would be flown on various areas in each
zone. This plan would keep model plane flying to a minimum
on any one area.

The Phoenix City Council acted rapidly, and amended

Henry T. Swan

the Code of the City of Phoenix pertaining to noise under
prohibitions to read as follows:

“To discharge into the open air the exhaust of any steam
engine, stationary internal combustion engine, motor vehicle
or 1notorboat engine, except through a muEer or other
device which will effectively prevent loud or explosive noises
therefrom, provided, however, that the flying of controlled
model airplanes, sailing of model boats or racing of model
automobiles, having internal combustion engines not to
exceed thirty-five hundredths cubic inch piston displacement,
when used in the pursuit of a recreation ‘hobby and at
such locations as are under the jurisdiction or control of the
Parks, Playgrounds and Recreational Board of the City
of Phoenix, and only at such times as may be designated
by the parks department shall not be deemed to be within
the provisions of this ordinance.”

As soon as flying was legalized, the Model Airplane Ad-
visory Committee of five members began to act. They set
up an all-city flying date, a time when model airplane en-
thusiasts from all over the city could gather together at one
area, not only to fly planes but also to secure first-hand
information concerning the new law pertaining to model
plane flight. As a result of this first of all-city flying events,
three local areas were opened to model plane flying.

Forms are used by the parks and recreation department
in establishing flying areas and times. ,These are filled out
by model plane enthusiasts—three fliers’ names are required
in order to establish a new flying area. The first three areas
opened happened to be school playgrounds. The Model
Airplane Committee approved the times requested by the
model airplane fliers with certain reservations. One request
came in to fly every night in the week at a certain school
ground. However, the committee felt that the flying should
be restricted in local neighborhoods so that the folks living
around the area would not be annoyed by the noise of the
small motors. The committee cut down on the time for
flying and established a twice-a-month schedule. On one
area, flying time is the second and fourth Wednesday from

99

5:00 P.M. until dark. On another area, flying time is the
first and third Friday, from 4:00 P.M. until dark. On
another area, which is a bit isolated, flying is permitted
every week on Saturday afternoon. Before flying can be
done on a school area, and after approval of the Model
Airplane Advisory Committee, a member of the parks and
recreation department staff consults with school oflicials and
secures clearance from the schools.

As soon as a flying area is approved, model plane hobby-
ists who have requested flying time are given about one
hundred copies of a letter which goes “To Our Neighbors.”
This letter is an introduction to the people around the
flying area, and reads in part: “We, your model airplane
flying neighbors, and our advisory committee, want you
to know the need and the good of the recreation hobby of
flying model airplanes.

“Model airplane building and flying is the number one
hobhy in the nation. One of the assets of this hobby is that
it brings youngsters and adults together in a common en-
deavor. The value of model flying has long been known by
the training divisions of our army and navy who sponsor
model airplane clubs and regional and national model
airplane competitions.

“We realize that the noise of these small motors is some-
times annoying; therefore, we plan on using any single
area as sparingly as possible.

“The advisory committee was formed to act as the liaison

agent between the public and the model fliers. Any problems,
questions, or information concerning flying on these parks
and playgrounds may be referred to any member of this
committee.” The five committee members and their tele-
phone numbers are listed and at the bottom of the page is
this notation: “We invite you to drop over and watch the
flying. It is really quite an art.” '

We have run into one problem: after flying was authorized
on one playground, the youngsters felt they could fly at any
time on that area. They began turning out at eight in the
morning—flying all day and into the evening. Model air-
plane committee members visited the area, talked to the
boys and enlisted their cooperation. Now, model airplane
flying is restricted to the times established by the committee.

The future of this program looks bright. All complaints
against model plane flying will be handled by the Model
Plane Advisory Committee. A group of adults and young-
sters will visit people who have complaints to make and will
attempt to convince them of the value of the activity.

Model airplane building and flying, according to a recent
survey of more than 11,500 hobby shops, department stores
and hobby magazine publishers, is the numher one hobby
in the United States today. Our army and navy need good
qualified pilots, engineers, and other aeronautical personnel.
One of the ways recreation departments can help the armed
forces prepare recruits is to make available model airplane
flying in their communities.

Our talent file is a stack of three- by
five-inch cards kept in a small case on
my desk. It contains the names of people
who can speak, act, sing, dance, lead
games, contests, ofliciate, lead singing,
conduct dance bands, do magic, or
assist in any kind of social event; and
it is for the community to use. It is a
handy reference when program chair-
men of service clubs, PTA’s, Scout
troops or 4-H clubs call on me for help.
It is part of our community service.

We huilt up our talent file by talking
with everyone with whom we came into
contact, asking each person if he would
like to he placed in it. Some people per-
form for a fee, but about ninety per cent
just like to do it for fun. Through the
personal contacts made in my role of
party leader, entertaincr and song
leader I have the opportunity to talk to
many folks, and each year many names
are added to the talent file. It, of course,
contains the names of the folks to con-
tact at the high school, the dance

studios, the music teachers in town and
the various departments at Kansas
State College—such as the radio station,
the dramatic, music and physical educa-
tion departments.

Every town is full of talent that is
often overlooked because no one has
taken the trouble to assemble informa-
tion about it. As a result, one sees .the
same array of talent time after time, and
certain other people miss the oppor-
tunity of performing at all. r

lt has been my effort to get people to
get out and perform. The teachers of
the schools and college have the samc
idea, and, as a result, we are constantly
running into new talent. The music and
dancing teachers are more than anxious
to show off their students, and get in
touch with me from time to time.

Our party service consists of litera-
ture, advice and supplies. Our literature,
of course, consists of all of the manuals
put out by the National Recreation As-

sociation. in addition we have our own

party guides, which we publish and dis-
tribute through the mail and at the
public library. We assist anyone to
plan a party, dance, banquet or social.
Our supplies consist of game kits,
movies, projectors, public address sys-
tems, records for square dancing, social
dancing or entertainment, phonographs,
rule books and flags. in our party game
kit we have twenty party games such as
rook, flinch, canasta, bridge, cribbage
boards, checkers dominoes, bingo,
monopoly, and so on. A merchant sup-
plies us with free playing cards, which
have his advertisement on the back.
We have made an effort during the
past two years to emphasize the import-
ance of home play, neighborhood
parties, and social occasions for small
groups. We keep the favorite slogan of
the National Recreation Association,
“The Family That Plays Together Stays

Norma Stahl interviews Virginia Tanner, Director

of the Children’s Dance Theater of Salt Lake City.

TWENTY-TWO little girls danced goodnight and the curtain

came down on the Jacob’s Pillow performance of the
Children’s Dance Theater. There was a second’s hush and
then the applause and bravos broke out. The audience, con-
sisting almost entirely of dance professionals, rose in a body
at the first curtain call. Many of them were in tears. Two
noted choreographers rushed backstage to embrace the
performers. A once-in-a-lifetime experience had occurred
and dance history was made.

Yet all that had happened on that July nineteenth evening
was that twenty-two youngsters from Salt Lake City had
danced the simple things they knew about: the patterns of
whirlpools they had seen under Niagara Falls on the trip
east; some childish nightmares about a dress caught in a
door; a clock ticking in an empty room; an anaesthetic that
made a tone resound; a goodnight dance in which, dressed
in white nightgowns, they asked blessing for tiny things
of the wilderness, while at the back of the open stage fire-
flies flickered in the summer evening.

Behind the magic of this night’s performance was the
week-long bus odyssey which brought Virginia Tanner,
her dancing children and their mothers from Salt Lake City,
starting at six A.M. on July eleventh. The spirit 6f good
trouping and amiability that marked the trip had a lot to do
with love of dance and a lot to do with Mormon ideals.
Cooperation was no new experience for these children and
their accompanying mothers. Along the way the group
sang Mormon hymns, sewed costumes, st0pped wherever
possible in state park grounds to limber up bus-cramped
muscles, and visited shrines that marked the long trek of
their Mormon forefathers out to the home these new pio-
neers had left. When they descended en masse at restaurants,
all ordered the same thing to help out the cooks and waiters.
Each child—some of them as young as eight—received a
twenty-dollar bill every five days from which she had to
budget food expenses. The budgeting went so well that there
was enough left for extra treats like the visit to Niagara Falls
and a trip around Chicago.

What the enthralled audience could not see were the
months of planning, the ingenuity and love by which children
and adults raised the money to make that appearance pos-
sible. The children were responsible for earning one hun-
dred dollars apiece for the fund. They dressed dolls, gave
musicals, and ran, with their mothers, possibly more rum-
mage sales and raffles than Salt Lake ever hopes to see again.
Mothers and grandmothersgave steak dinners and charged
admission. Fathers got after the business firms. The Church
of the Latter Day Saints donated a sum, as did the mayor
and other city officials. An addition of eight hundred dol-

in back. See if you can touch them with your toes.” Little
legs shoot out, straight as ramrods, tiny arches curve, toes in
a perfect point. If there is jumping or leaping to be done,
then they must pluck the cherries from the highest bough.
Imaginations are kindled and technique is acquired through
the child’s own desire to reach the imaginative goals that
are set. This is an attempt to teach technique creatively, not
to develop professional dancers in any one style. At present,
Lcw Christensen, teaching ballet at the University of Utah,
has ten students trained by Miss Tanner. Others of the chil-
dren who go on to train for professional careers find them-
selves well-equipped with the fundamentals that prepare
them for any style of dance.

Miss Tanner’s pupils at the school range in age from
three to eighteen, and she of course adjusts her approach
to the needs of each age. For the talented older girls, who
have been with her at least six years for example, there is also
the teacher-training program, from which they go on to be-
conlc demonstrators for her classes. She has three such
young student-teachers at present. The students who have all
their dance classes after regular school hours, meet for two
one-and-a-half-hour classes each week. The younger pupils
have two one-hour sessions.

Miss Tanner discovered dance early and discovered, also,
some of its evil practices which nearly robbed her of thc

Dance Theater in an imaginative number danced on TV show.

career for which she seemed suited since babyhood. As she
loved to dance, her parents enrolled her when she was six
at a dance studio where a rigid technique was imposed on
cven the tiniest pupils. Virginia ended the first day in tears
and never wanted to see another dance class. The memory
of a harsh discipline which killed the joy she felt when
dancing by herself stayed with her, and in fact she did not
again enter a dance studio until she was eighteen. This was
in Washington, D. C., where she studied with Evelyn Davis,
who specialized in the teaching of children and incorporated
into her work “a soul-giving thing” which young Virginia

FEBRUARY 1954

u

was looking for. This was her first formal training.

After that, she was back at the University of Utah to get
her degree. There, she says, dance was “still in the scarf-
and balloon-throwing era.” The closest Virginia could get
to what she wanted was by taking a physical education
major. In 1939, she heard that the Humphrey-Weidman
group was touring. How wonderful it would be, she felt, to
invite them to Salt Lake City! She rushed around to various
civic groups and culture clubs. No one saw the point. In
the end, Virginia decided there was only one thing to do.
She would sponsor the recital herself. She rented a hall, got
out publicity, had tickets and programs printed and sold
$1,500 worth of tickets. Salt Lake City saw its first modern
dance recital. So impressed was Doris Humphrey with this
young, dance-hungry impressario, that she offered her a
scholarship in New York. The next fall Virginia was hard at
work in the Humphrey studio.

Now she was on the right path and knew it. There were
to be no more detours. She would help children to discover
dance.

She began her classes at the McCune School of Music out
of which grew the Children’s Dance Theater. At the same
time she began the practice of ever so often coming back
east to study. But she emphasizes that this study is for
herself. She does not keep coming back so that she can
teach her children the latest things from New York. She is
free from that erroneous modesty carried about by a number
of teachers who regard themselves as nothing but empty
vessels to be filled at the founts of professional studios,
thence to be rushed back to the hinterlands without spilling
a drop and dumped over the parched heads of their students.

She has grown with the school. She likes to recall how
at the beginning she gave classes consisting of forty-five
minutes of improvisations and fifteen of technique. Now the
proportions are reversed and the major part of the class is
devoted to the creative approach she has developed to tcach
technique.

Miss Tanner is very positive when she speaks of dance
as a spiritual experience second only to a religious experi-
ence. She believes, in fact, that the church and the dance
class supplement each other. As she sees it, the dance is a
kind of faith. The deeper the faith of the child in what she
is dancing, the deeper will be the spiritual response. It is
because children are so eminently capable of faith, and also
because Miss Tanner has managed to remember “why it

was she started to dance,” that the Children’s Dance Theater
has been possible.

‘-

One small incident takes its place beside what will surely
become a great legendary dance event at Jacob’s Pillow.
When the “bravos” began to thunder down, one little girl
who had never before been far from home, and who was
quite unaware of her power to make a magic world for
adults, touched “Miss Ginny’s” arm. “Why are they calling
‘Provo’?” she asked. “Bravo” was a word unknown to her,
and ‘Provo’ is a neighbor town to Salt Lake City. The little
girl knew a lot more about Provo than about what happens
when an audience of professionals breaks down and cheers.

television has brought the ballet into the home, and every
little girl at some time or other visualizes herself as a bal-

lerina, floating over the stage in a tou-tou or cloud of chiffon.
In many cases the embryo ballerina high-pressures her par-
ents for ballet lessons. However, ballet dancing is a skill and
requires many hours of practice, just as ,learning to play
the piano or acquiring any of the sports skills. Within a short
time many children lose interest in the dance because of
the constant repetition and monotony of learning steps and
exercises.

Usually the desire for lessons comes between the ages of
five to nine years. Any child who so wishes, boy or girl,
should be given the Opportunity to explore the field of the
dance. It should be a pleasant experience that teaches him
something about the ballet, the fundamentals of movement
and rhythm and gives him a chance for self-expression. Some
children are able to express themselves through speech, but
most children can do so only through action. Here we have
a field that covers many facets of recreation—dancing,
rhythms, creative activity, music and socialization.

At the Bergen Street School Community Center, Newark,
New Jersey, there has been a demand for ballet classes for
the past four years. Previously the requests were for tap
and folk dancing. It was realized that the center could not
meet the requirements of the typical ballet class. Nor did
we care to do so. Our facilities consist of one very small
gymnasium, irregular in shape. As there is no piano, a record
player is used. The first two years of classes were experi-
mental to a certain degree, the teacher trying out the classic
ballet, modern ballet and rhythmics to find the medium best
suited for a playground program. At the start of the third
year we knew what we wanted the child to experience and
also what the child really enjoyed. We were able to set up
these objectives. To give to every child:

1. The experience of the joy of expression through
movement.

4. Knowledge of all the different ways in which the body

5. Opportunity to develop a sense of rhythmic accuracy.
6. Knowledge of some of the fundamental ballet steps and

7. Opportunity for socialization within the group.

In October, 1952, eighty little girls, between the ages of
seven and ten years, reported to the gymnasium for their
first lesson. Sixty of them remained until the closing of class
at thc end of April, which is a fairly good indication that they
en oyed the lessons and felt that they were learning to dance.
The group was divided into two classes, meeting on different
days, because of the inadequate size of the gymnasium. For

RECREATION

the same reason, only girls were enrolled, and the age classi-
fication was enforced. Every effort was made to keep fast
learners in one group. Age is not necessarily the criteria for
the grouping, as some ten-year-olds learn no faster than
cight-year-olds and vice versa. Lessons are free, no costume
is required. Everyone dances barefooted, some of the chil-
dren wear playsuits or shorts and blouses, while ust a few
have leotards. Some ust wear their school clothing. No
visitors are allowed except the few mothers who call for
their children. Incidentally, these mothers Operate the record
player, take an active part in party preparation and program,
assist the children to change their clothes and help in many
other ways.

The recordings we use are Freda Miller’s Album Number
1, Accompaniment for Dance Technique, and Album Num-
ber 4, Music for Rhythms and Dance; also, RCA Victor Al-
bum Number 5, Rhythmic Activities. There are many other
recordings that may be used; however, rccordings are ex-
pensive and the Freda Miller albums offer more variety and
are better suited for this type of activity than others that
we have heard. They can be ordered from her at 8 Tudor

City Place, New York City.

A typical lesson begins with about ten minutes of simple
limbering exercises. Most of these are done either sitting
or lying on the floor and are patterned after modern ballel
techniques but adapted for the use of this particular age
roup. We do not emphasize differentiating between right
or left foot or hand and take very little time for individual
correction. There is almost constant general correction or

 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   

reminders during the exercise to straighten up or point the
toe or straighten the knee; but never does correction slow
up the lesson so that any child loses interest. By the end of
the season most of the children have developed fairly good
techniques. No exercise is continued for a duration so long
as to tire the child. These limbering exercises include many
lOD-lOCOIUOlOI‘ movements—bending, stretching, pushing,
ulling, turning, twisting, swaying, swinging, striking,
odging, shaking, vibrating, rising and falling.

The limbering exercises are followed by locomotor activ-
ties—walking, running, skipping, sliding, umping, hop-
)ing, leaping and galloping. The rhythm is clapped out until
it is learned, then all can enter the activity in a spirit of
play: we gallop like horses with “Hi-Ho Silver” resounding
throughout the gym, we ump like a bouncing ball and have
other similar activities. After this period we listen to a
recording and thc children are asked, “What can you do
to this music?” Then they demonstrate whatever locomotor
or non-locomotor activity is fitting for that particular record-
ing. Or we might ask, “How does this music make you feel?”
They will reSpond by saying, “Happy,” “Gay,” “Sad,”
“Mad,” “Tired” or whatever emotion or feeling the music
has suggested to thcm. Then we act or “dance” the theme.
The lesson usually ends with an activity that includes ump-
ing or leaping or combinations of these, and every little girl
says goodnight to the instructor with a curtsy in traditional
ballet style.

No dance steps are taught until five or six months after
the lessons have started, yet the children feel that they are

FEBRUARY 1954

learning to dance right from the start and are able to express
themselves through rhythmic activity within a very short
time. The first week in December the teacher announced
a joint Christmas party of both ballet classes, to be held
just before the closing of school for the Christmas holiday.
Each class was to make up a dance as part of the entertain-
ment. This was accomplished by playing several appropriate,
seasonal recordings for them. They were asked to think of
a Christmas story that they could tell by “dancing it out”
to any of the recordings. There were a few suggestions the
first week and by the following week almost every child had
some suggestion. In one class the story the children liked
best was that of the,first snowflake of the season that camc
down from heaven and fell into a puddle of muddy water.
The other snowflakes saw the plight of the first flake and
followed it down until there was no longer a puddle, just
clean snow. Here was a simple theme, of their own devising,
within their understanding, which they could and did inter-
pret for their own enjoyment and that of the other class.

In March the children made up their own ballet. We all
talked about it, and decided to take a week to think it over.
At the end of the week, the children all discussed their
ideas, and a little nine-year-old brought in a complete
original story she had thought up for the ballet. She told
it to the group, and they unanimously and enthusiastically
accepted it. And so the ballet “Springtime” was born. The
ballet was presented at the closing party the end of April.
Parents, brothers and sisters were invited, and there was
no admission fee, just a ten-cent charge for ice cream for
those who cared for it. The mothers contributed cake and
cookies. Each class was responsible for certain parts of the
ballet, the children making up or interpreting the action
throughout, with the exception of the finale, which was
danced by all in true classical manner. The children watch
ballet on television at home and get some idea of inter-
pretation from this medium. However, it was observed that
those things they noticed and incorporated from television
were, to a great extent, similar or the same activities or
steps that they had learned in class. This shows that not
only have they learned to appreciate and understand ballet

on television, but that television has helped them to eXpress
themselves through the dance.

The teacher does help to put the dances together, as there
are many ideas and suggestions from the group. Occasionally
there are no ideas or interpretations forthcoming, then the
teacher works with the children from what they know,
helping them to think of things or people or activities that
they have observed, until they are able to bring about a
solution of their problem. '

The costumes worn for the ballet party were very simple.
For instance, those girls who were flowers wore pastel sum-
mer dresses and crepe paper hats made to resemble a flower.
The butterflies wore bathing suits or leotards and paper-
muslin wings with the design applied with crayon. Thc cos-
tumes were made by older children in the playground craft
groups. All the participants enjoyed the experience. They
had fun in their own share of the endeavor and in observing
the efforts of the other groups.

105

It is a simple matter to present a ballet of this type. There
are no long rehearsals necessary. Each group learns its
own part of the ballet during regular class time, after the
routine lesson. The few soloists work out their parts in other
than class time and only one rehearsal for the entire group
is held.

There are many advantages in this kind of creative
rhythmic activity in a playground program. Large classes
can be accommodated and the interest of most of the children
can be held. The teacher need not be highly skilled or trained
in any field of the dance. Any physical-education major,
or someone who knows a little about ballet and rhythmic
activity, can teach a class of this sort. There are no expenses
for this activity except for the recordings. At our play-
ground, the teacher is a regular staff member. With rhythms
or dance classes of this type one has a great deal of material

for a playground show. With very little preparation and
few rehearsals, these children can make up a dance or ballet
that has meaning to them and to the audience. Furthermore,
the dance can take the theme of any type of show the play-
ground is presenting.

The°value of these dance lessons to the child is obvious
to the parents. The comments most frequently made are to
the effect that the child has gained poise and self-assurance.
that she can mingle and feel at home with groups of children.
either friends or strangers, and that an interest has been
aroused in the other arts. Here is an activity that aids in the
deve10pment of the total personality and helps the child to
arrive at his fullest growth—physically, mentally and emo-
tionally—through increased body coordination and skills.
a greater appreciation of the arts, and through the joy of
expression through movement.

"\Ve Participate in Recreation”

Anyone working in recreation is faced with the problem
of getting to the public—letting people know that your
program includes them, and making them aware that it
affords pleasure, relaxation, and education. In most recrea-
tion activities, nationwide, it’s a policy to register those who
participate in any phase of the program or share in the
use of public or private facilities. These people form an
excellent base for broadening the understanding of specific
activities as well as the over-all program.

In Brookfield, lllinois—-—voted one of America’s ten out—
standing cities in 1952—~this problem of publicity was con-
sidered by the recreation department. It occurred to us that
something was needed to stimulate questions about recrea-
tion—something not normally included in standard forms
of publicity such as printed program schedules, newspaper
articles, or special bulletins. Rather than something to be
worn, a decalcomania which can be mounted on the family
automobile windshield, on a window of the home, or count-
less other places, was designed.

The decal is simple but carries a message. It is in thc
form of a circle three and a half inches in diameter. Cir-
cumscribing the upper half of the circle is “WE PARTICIPATE
IN” in black lettering; the word “RECREATION,” in bold blue
letters, runs horizontally through the center; and the words
“IN BROOKFIELD,” in black letters, complete the lower half
of the circle. A blue silhouette figure is used in the centcr
above the word “recrcation.” (Our figure is a swimmer
because Brookfield has a year-round swimming program;
however, any figure or design relating to the local over-all

program would be suitable.) The background is white, ant
thc whole decal is set off by a bright red border.

Decals have several advantages: mounted on glass, the}
will last for two years; they are bright, colorful, and inoffen
sive; they are most economical when purchased in amount:
of a thousand or more. The first thousand should cost abou
sixty to seventy dollars, including the art work which the
firm will do for you at your direction and approval. Afte1
that, if you can use more decals, they become progressivel]
less expensive as no art work is necessary on the reorder
However, seven cents each is not a high price to pay i1
order to bring recreation before the eyes and into t'lu
thoughts of so many people.

What good does a decal do? Well, we all like to be mem
bcrs of something or other; we are gregarious by nature
The decal distinguishes us as one of a special group. Sinc:
the recreation participant knows all about the phase in whicl
he is active, he is eloquent when his neighbor asks wha
that “recreation thing” stands for; he begins by telling abou
his pet activity. His neighbor may be interested, but per
haps doesn’t care for this particular project, so asks wha
else is doing in local recreation. Chances are the recreatior
advertiser can give him some additional information an:
refers the questioner to the recreation office for more detail
There, you see, is real word of mouth advertising arising
from this decal.

Do the pe0ple like them? They certainly do. They displaj
them proudly and are disappointed if they are inadvertentlj
omitted when the decals are distributed; so from our point
of-view they are both effective and inexpensive publicity
Their use adds to the local color and is a good interes
stimulator.

RECREATIOI

 

Not long ago, we were lucky enough to have several of
our training specialists spend a few days in the o’gice.
We shop-talked, of course, and out came some examples of

usual accidents, or disagreeable incidents, that had taught
Fem. a lesson. W e thought you might like to hear about
item, so that you can profit by their experience. Discuss
item in staf] meeting. Use them in your in-service training
program.

1. Relays Indoors.  play leader was conducting a relay
Ind didn’t notice that the baseline was too close to the wall.
E little girl came dashing across, couldn’t stop, put out her
ands to keep from hitting the wall—and broke both wrists.
Remedy: Always be sure that any baseline is far enough
away from a wall to allow the player to slow down. This
onuld hold true of trees, posts, and so on, out of doors.
2. Indoor Games. Many indoor gyms or rooms have
osts, either round or square. Both are dangerous, par-
[icularly- the square one's. In playing active games in such
.11 area, shins, noses, hands and feet have been cut or
bruised by running into these posts. (Could be trees out-
oors.)

emedy: Try to get posts covered with padded canvas. If
ou don’t see the room ahead of time, and find these posts
uncovered, have three or four people stand around the
)osts while the game is going on.

. Broken Glasses.

) The group wanted to play Arches (the mixer in which
everal couples form arches and at a signal lower their
rms to catch others passing through, who then form arches,
until no one is left.) One man’s glasses fell off and were
)roken as be bent to go under the arch.

emedy: Always look around the group to see who’re
rearing glasses, and use those people to form the first
arches.

b) A boy in a volleyball game took off his glasses, put them

km the sideline—and the ball hit and broke them.
iemedy: Always warn players to put their glasses in the
case, or give them to someone to hold.

c) A man in a grand march stuck his glasses in his breast-
pocket. In bending over to go under an arch, the glasses
dropped out of his pocket and were broken.

Remedy: Warn men to put glasses in case, and case in side
coat pocket; women to put glasses in case in handbag—or
give to a spectator to hold.

4. Square Dance Slip-Up. A girl sprained her ankle by
slipping on the floor while square dancing.

Remedy: Never square dance or lead games on a waxed
floor without precautions. If you can, make sure ahead of
time that the floor is not waxed. If it has been waxed, make

the group take off their shoes. Bare feet are even better
than stocking feet.

5. Break-Through Games. In Red Rover, one team of
young recreation leaders had been reduced to two players.
They called the name of one of the opposing players; and
that young girl came dashing across, eager to break through
and win the game for her side. The two players holding
hands had braced themselves so well that when the girl hit
their arms they were thrown together, their heads hit, and
they were both knocked unconscious.

Remedy: Make the rule that a team in such a game wins
when the opposing team has been reduced to three or four

players.

6. Evade Ball. (The game requiring three teams. The
members of one team run in turn between the other two
teams from a fixed line, up to and around some point,
while the members of the other two teams attempt to throw
a ball that will hit the runner before he gets back to his line
for a point.) A player turned his head to see where the ball
was, and consequently veered left, running headlong into
the next player on his side who had started to run. Both
players were knocked out.

Remedy: Draw a line across the starting line. Require the
runner to stay to his own right in returning, and the team
to stay right of this dividing line in starting.

7. Chasing and Line Games. In games like Snatch The
Handkerchief and Slap Tag, the player often snatches or
slaps and then attempts to run backwards. When tagged,
he can fall backwards very easily and get hurt seriously.
Remedy: Always explain, demonstrate and require the
player to approach sideways, so that one foot will be behind
him to act as a pivot. The player can then turn and run for-
ward. If he is tagged and should fall, a forward fall is not
as dangerous as a backward fall—and there’s much less

‘ chance of falling.

8. Mouselrap. (Mousetrap is an adaptation of Arches,
used for small children. Those forming the arches are the
traps; the others are the Mice. At the word “Snapl”, those
forming the arches try to catch the others in the trap.) Small
children, in their excitement, tend to push those ahead of
them in the line, sometimes causing a fall.

Remedy: Explain that every mouse has a tail. Each child
joins his hands behind his back to form the tail. This pre-

vcnts pushing and shoving.

9. Microphones. In playing games or dancing, players or
dancers often stumble over the extension cords, sometimes
falling or causing the mike to fall.

Remedy: Put the mike as near a wall as possible, and see
that a row of chairs is set in front of it.

I-Ceramic crafts, as program activity or hobby, are
popular with all ages and require careful handling.

 

I Good housekeeping principlcs and personal cleanliness, to
protect hcallh of participants, should be strictly observed.

A Word of Warning

THE popularity of ceramics as a recreational hobby craft
has been increasing throughout the past few years. One
I of the newer aspects of this work is the process of firing
a glaze on copper.

Recently the health department of the City of Los Angeles
was requested to study recreational ceramics to determine
whether there are any serious health hazards in connection
I with the handling of the material, firing, and other processes.

For the benefit of all recreation workers, part of the analysis

of this report, along with the recommendations, is quoted:

“Mainly low temperature fired glazes, below 2000 degrees

F., are used in hobby work. These glazes are commercially

prepared in an aqueous solution for direct application, for

the most part. Low-fired glazes may contain leaded frits,
which can, if used improperly, cause lead intoxication.

“We found that some of the students were surprised to
learn that ceramic glazes represent a health hazard. This
is significant, since many of the adult students are instruc-
tors for ceramic classes held in the various parks scattered
throughout the city, and some of these classes, we under-
stand, are held for young children.

“The two methods by which lead may enter the human
body are ingestion and inhalation. Lead is usually ingested

because of ignorance. All hobbyists should be warned that

MR. WILLIAM F REDERICKSON, JR., is the superintendent of
recreation for the City of Los Angeles in California.

washing the hands of leaded materials before eating or
smoking is important in preventing lead poisoning. Young
children should be closely supervised to see that all con-
taminated articles are kept out of the mouth.

“Lead may be inhaled in two forms, an aqueous mist or
leaded dust. In the first case we have heard that glazes can
be sprayed on articles. All spraying should be done with
adequate provisions for the control of generated mist, in
order to prevent its entering the breathing zone of the
hobbyist. A spray booth is the best device for such control.

“Glazes dry into dust which may be dispersed into the
air by currents of air generated by atmospheric conditions
or just plain foot traffic. For this reason, good housekeeping
practices are a must. Equipment, floors, and table tops should
be regularly cleaned by vacuum or wet methods.

“Two air samples were taken during kiln-firing of ceramic
articles in the basement. We wanted to determine the amount
of lead fume given off during the firing period, which takes
up a full day. One sample was taken with all outside win-
dows and the door leading into the room closed, and the
other with all the _doors and windows opened. Neither sample
showed any significant quantities of lead.

“While making our survey we learned of a metal jewelry
hobby in which glazes are applied to the finished copper
metal articles. Low-fired glazes are also used here and the
same precautions should be taken as were previously men-
tioned.

“Below in summarized form are the recommendations we
believe will help make hobby ceramics a safer pastime:

Recommendations

1. Students should be informed about the toxicity of leaded
compounds.

2. Students should be taught good housekeeping principles
and the importance of personal cleanliness.

3. Young children should be closely supervised to prevent
the chance of ingestion of leaded material from contaminatcd
articles, food and hands.

4-. All glaze spraying operations should be adequately con-
trolled to prevent the inhalation of mist.”

If we are not observing the recommendations made
herein, and if any of the conditions obtain in our own opera-
tions, we should take steps to protect patrons or recreation
workers against the hazards which are shown to exist in
ceramic craft.

Specification for

Asphaltic Pavement
on a PLAYGROUND

 

I SHALL NOT be so naive as to state emphatically that as-

phalt is the proper surfacing for all places for play. How-
ever, analysis of all the facts gathered to date by the surfac-
ing committees of the American Institute of Park Executives
and the National Recreation Association, on which I have
served for four years, indicates that we should retain the
asphalt bituminous surface as the standard for the general
play area. Until a better and less eXpensive surface is pro-
duced, I, as a park and recreation area dcsigner, shall con-
tinue to use and to recommend its use for multiple-use areas.

The problems involved in the use of aSphalt, or any other
type of pavement, for places to play require the services of a
capable designer, one who knows how to plan a site for
maximum use and who has a good working knowledge of
the materials to be incorporated. Satisfactory surfaces can

be achieved only by:

1. Good design and preparation of complete Specifica-
tions.

2. Using thc best products or materials available.

3. Retention of qualified technicians, skilled workmen,
and the use of proper equipment.

A deficiency in any of these factors may result in seriously
impaired usefulness of the surface or the need of costly
repairs.

ASphaltic- or bituminous-surfaced pavements can be laid
over bituminous base, water-bound base ,or concrete. The
surface should be smooth, dense, impervious and fine
grained, of a tcxture similar to sheet or hot-laid aSphalt.
The hot-laid kinds of the fine-aggregate type are standard
and produced for highway pavements in most states and
large cities. Good patented bituminous base course and sur-
face materials, usually cold-laid, are available on the mar-
ket, but we should take full advantage of the equals which

struction, Department of Public Properties, Cleveland.

are generally manufactured or mixed locally. The specifica
tions for an asphalt or bituminous surfacing should be pre
pared with full knowledge of the surfacing laid on loca
traffic pavements, that is, of the kinds which local pave
ment constructors are equipped to lay and for which aggre
gate is available. The specifications for the complete pave
ment may often be simplified and costs reduced by reference
to city, county, or state highway department specifications
Most paving contractors prefer to bid on state specifications
but these should be examined carefully and all requirements
be eliminated that are not entirely practicable in their appli
cation to the specific project.

The design of the pavement depends upon the use it is t(
serve and the nature of the soil upon which it is to be con
structed. 0n porous soils the over-all thickness of the pave
ment can be a specified minimum; but on heavy plastic clay
soils the pavement thickness must be increased. Sub-soi'
drainage is extremely important and should be providec~
unless the sub-soil is porous and not subject to rising 01
lateral water movement. Surface drainage is also important
and longitudinal slopes under two per cent on asphalt wil
develop surface water pockets. In large paved and extremel)
flat areas, drain inlets and catch basins with adequate out
lets must be installed and placed so as not to interfere wit]
the designed use of the play areas. All asphalt play arcas
should be confined within curbed (flush or raised) edgings

I have been asked to prepare a typical specification f0]
an “asphaltic pavement for a playground.” Frankly, I won
der if it is wise to prepare such a document, for no tw(
sites are similar, and conditions vary greatly. Technica'
information in the hands of a neophyte can be dangerous
and can cause the preparing agent considerable grief. In the
face of these apprehensions I shall outline a specificatior
for an asphalt playground pavement laid over a waterbounc
base as diagramatically shown on Plate A, but admonisl
the user that the text and sketch are for guide purpose only

RECREATIOD

If you are a neophyte, by all means retain a consultant or a
designer for your project drawings and contract specifica-

tions.

Inverted Choke

Under average soil conditions the completed playground
pavement should be not less than six inches in thickness and
preferably seven inches. The bottom course or first layer
to be installed over the prepared subgrade should be a fine
aggregate insulation course or inverted choke of granulated
stone material, sometimes referred to as screenings, one to
two inches in uniform compacted thickness. The fine aggre-
gate should be composed of limestone, air cooled blast fur-
nace slag, crushed gravel screenings, or grade B water
granulated blast furnace slag, graded so that 100 per cent
passes a standard 1Ag-inch sieve, 90 to 100 per cent passes a
9/3-inch sieve and 10 to 30 per cent passes the No. 100 sieve.
The aggregate for this base course should be spread upon the
prepared subgrade to such depth that after compaction it
will be of the form and dimensions shown on the project
plans. The placement of the inverted choke gives added
assurance that the bottom voids in the heavier stone aggre-

gate to be added above will be filled. After spreading, the
material should, if necessary, be watered sufficiently to
secure satisfactory compaction—accomplished by means of
a three-wheeled general purpose roller or tandem roller
weighing not less than five tons nor more than ten tons.
Places inaccessible to the power roller should be thoroughly
compactcd with hand or other acceptable tampers. This and

subsequent courses should not be rolled when the subgrade
is soft, or when the rolling causes a wave-like motion in the
course.

Foundation Course

Over the inverted choke course or subgrade there should
be placed a foundation course, for the surface course, of
crushed limestone or slag and screenings, or gravel of coarse
and fine grade. The coarse limestone or slag aggregate
should be No. 12 size or No. 2 size of the U. 5. Standard
Sieve'Series ranging in size: (No. 12) from 31/2 inches to
1% inches; or (N o. 2) from 21/2 inches to 1% inches in size.
The fine aggregate to be used as filler should consist of
screenings ranging in size from 1A), inch down, with 10 to 30
per cent passing the N o. 100 mesh sieve. If the coarse aggre-
gate is gravel, it should range in size from 1% inches down
with a maximum of 75 per cent passing through a 14-inch
sieve, from 10 to 20 per cent through the No. 100 mesh
sieve, and not over 8 per cent through the No. 200 mesh
sieve.

The water-bound macadam base course should be four
inches in depth after compaction to the lines and grades

shown on the plans. The aggregate should be uniformly
spread by acceptable methods to the loose stone depth re-
quirements, and then compacted with three-wheeled general
purpose rollers or three-wheeled finishing rollers weighing
not less than ten tons. This unfilled aggregate course of
limestone or slag should be rolled only sufficiently to obtain
maximum keying. Each one thousand square yards of this

113

compacrea course should receive not less than twelve hours
of actual rolling time.

After the limestone or slag aggregate has been given the
initial keying, the fine aggregate or screenings should be
applied gradually over the surface, during the filling pro-
cess of rolling or vibrating, in such an amount as will com-
pletely fill the interstices. The screenings should not be
dumped in piles on the surface of the aggregate, but should
be spread by approved mechanical spreaders or applied
gradually over the surface with a spreading motion of a
square point shovel and swept into the course in such an
amount as will completely fill all voids.

The finishing can be effected with a roller or vibratory
unit, equipped with a broom of an approved type, while the
screenings are being spread, so that a jarring effect will aid
them in settling to the bottom. If the screenings are in a wet
or damp condition they should not be rolled, vibrated or
broomed until the surface of the particles has dried off. The
spreading and rolling should be prosecuted in sections not
to exceed in area that which can be filled and rolled within
one day’s operations, and should continue until no more
screenings will go in dry. If rainfall appears likely, the
area should be lessened to that which can be filled and rolled
prior to the rain. No excess of screenings should be used
before applying water.

Immediately after the voids of a section have been filled
with screenings, the macadam should be sprinkled until
saturated, the sprinkler being followed by the roller. More
screenings should be added if necessary. The sprinkling,
sweeping and rolling should continue until a grout has been
formed of the screenings and water that will fill all voids
and will form a wave of grout before the wheels of the
roller. The macadam should be puddled as many times as
may be necessary to secure satisfactory results. When a
section has been thoroughly filled and grouted, such section
should be left to dry out. The finished surface of the course
should conform so nearly to that indicated on the project
plans that it will nowhere vary more than half an inch from
a ten foot straight edge applied to the surface.

The surface of the base course should be maintained in
its finished condition until the surface course or pavement
is placed on it. During the construction of the base course,
when the temperature is below 40° F ., the surface of the
course should be protected against freezing—for a period
of twenty-four hours after the water binding has been com-
pleted——by a sufficient covering of straw or other approved
method.

When the stone, slag or gravel water-bound macadam base
course has been completed, it should be thoroughly swept
until the embedded aggregate composing the macadam is
exposed but not dislodged, and this Surface or portions to
be primed must be thoroughly dry. For surface areas under
five thousand square yards, mechanical cleaning or sweeping
equipment need not be required but may be performed with
scrapers, shovels, and hand brooms.

Prime Coat

After the surface has been thoroughly cleaned, and when
in a warm dry condition, a prime coat of medium curing

114

liquid asphalt of MC-2, having a penetration at 25° C. of
100-200, should be applied in one or more uniform applica-
tions by means of heating and distributing equipment at
the rate of two-tenths gallons per square yard. The F aren-
heit temperature of the bituminous material at the time
of application should be within the limits of a minimum
125° F. and maximum 225° F. The bituminous material
should be heated to application temperature by means of a
tank car heater or booster, and should not be heated with
free steam. No bituminous material should be applied when
the temperature of the atmosphere is below 50° F ., nor when
the air temperature within the preceding twenty-four hours
has been below 40° F. or lower.

The surfaces of all structures or adjacent construction to
the surface area to be prime coated should be protected by

a satisfactory method or device to prevent their being marred

necessary to prevent tracking or picking up of the bituminous
material, a sand cover of two to five pounds per square yard
should be applied immediately after the prime coat.

We now come to the “wearing course” and, in Cleveland,
we prefer the use of a hot-mixed, hot-laid asphaltic concrete,
known as State of Ohio, Department of Highways, Specifica-
tion T-50, Type C (Fine Texture). This course is con-
structed on the prepared ‘base, in accordance with these spe-
cifications and in conformity with the lines, grades, de-
signed thickness and typical cross sections shown on the
project plans. We standardize in the construction of this
final or wearing course, and it is spread as a 11/3-inch-thick
course._

At this point I shall generalize since the detailed speci-
ficatious for the construction methods in the preparation
of hot-mixed, hot-laid asphaltic concrete are lengthy and
cover: the batch or mixing plant; the field laboratory; the
preparation of aggregates; the preparation of the asphalt
cement; the preparation of mixtures and temperature con-
trol; cleaning of base; forms and supports for spreading;
transportation and spreading of mixtures; spreading and
finishing; transverse joints; gutter seal; small tools and
portable equipment; surface tolerances; protection of wear-
ing course; and requirements for smoothness. Again, one
should follow the local highway specifications for the equal
of the State of Ohio, Department of Highways, T-50

[Bureau of Public Roads—Class I), Type “C” Wearing
:ourse (Fine Texture).

In general thc asphaltic concrete used for the wearing
mrface course should consist of an intimate mixture of
:oarse and fine mineral aggregate and asphaltic cement
.ncorporated together by the hot-mix method. The aSphaltic
:ement should have a penetration at 25° C. of 70 to 80 for
zitller asphalt produced by distilling and refining of pet-
'olcum or that produced by refined and fluxed Trinidad
Lake aSphalt. The aSpllalt cement should be free from coal
’ar pitch or any of its derivatives. It should be homogeneous
'nd free from water. The composition by weight of the
nix should be within the range limits indicated in Plate B.

l To maintain sufficient film thickness, to secure the max-
num per cent of aSphalt that the grading of the aggregate
rill carry, to insure that the asphalt is not overheated (no
isphalt should be used while “foaming”), and to provide
1 mixture which may be satisfactorily spread and finished,
Ihc contractor should adjust the temperatures of hot-mixed
asphalt concrete mixtures within reasonable and workable
'ilnits below 325° F. In fact, alloaSphalt cement heated be-
{011d 375° F. at the plant before mixing or heated beyond
325° F. during the mixing should be rejected.

The asphaltic cement mixture should not be placed nor
Ipread when the prepared base course is unduly wet or
when weather conditions prevent proper spreading, finish-
lug or compaction. As a rule of thumb, no asphaltic concrete
ihould be placed between October 31 and May 15 or in
temperatures below 50° F. Immediately prior to the placing
of the surface mixture, the base should be thoroughly
'r'leancd of all soil or loose and foreign materials.’

Adjacent abutting vertical construction, such as build-
ings, walls or curbs, should be thoroughly painted with hot
E1)lialt cement or asphalt emulsion to a greater depth than
lhe thickness of the surface or wearing course. Care must
e exercised so as not to stain adjacent surfaces above the
pavement.

The asphaltic concrete should be spread and finished by
[means of mechanical self-powered pavers,
preaders, or acceptable hand methods. Areas inaccessible
0 standard rolling equipment or which cannot be properly
ompacted with standard rolling equipment should be
lloroughly compacted by the use of ta'mps meeting the

approved

bpproval of those in charge. Longitudinal and transverse

ints should be made in a careful manner. Well bonded and
tailed joints are required, and all joints should be painted
vith the same hot asphalt cement contained in thc mixture
)efore placing adjacent asphaltic concrete.

 

Care should be exercised by the contractor to secure a
[mo and uniform alignment and grade along outside edges

of the pavement. If necessary, to secure such results, wood
or steel forms should be provided and firmly staked in place.

The wearing coursc should be finished one-half inch above
the top of adjacent Hush construction, forms or curbs in
order that proper compaction can be obtained.

After spreading, the mixture should be thoroughly and
hniformly compacted by rolling when the material has the
proper temperature for rolling and when the rolling does

not cause undue displacement or checking. The required
rolling should be completed with tandem rollers weighing
from five to ten tons while the material is at a temperature
at which the proper compaction can be secured. To prevent
adhesion of asphalt, the rolls should be kept moist, but an
excess of water must not be used. In areas adjacent to build-
ings, equipment or other places inaccessible to a roller, the

required compression should be secured with hot hand-
tamps.

Should any depressions remain after the final compac-
tion has been obtained, the surface course mixture should
be removed to such extent as directed and satisfactorily re-
placed by new material, or the low area may be reheated
with a surface heater and new materials added in sufficient
amount to form a true and even surface.

All high spots or high joints slightly exceeding thc re-
quirements for smoothness should be removed by the use
of such power driven surface grinders as do not tear or
crack the aggregate in the composition or otherwise damage
the finished product.

The correction or adjustment of surface irregularities are
understood to be only for isolated or occasional unavoid-
able cases and any equipment or method of placing, finish-
ing or compacting the mixture that causes such irregularities
should be discarded or corrected at once. All pavement areas

showing excessive irregularities should be removed and
replaced.

The finished wearing course should not vary more than
one-quarter inch from a templet cut to the cross section of
the course and as applied parallel to the centerline or water
flow line of the pavement. Any irregularity of the surface
exceeding the above limits should be corrected. Such por-
tions of the completed pavement as are defective in surface
compression or composition, or that do not comply with
the requirements of the specifications, should be taken up,
removed and replaced with suitable material and properly
laid in accordance with the specifications at the expense of
the contractor.

After the completion of the wearing course, no trach
should be permitted on any pertion of the completed hot;
mixed aSphaltic concrete pavement until it has cooled
sufliciently, and in no case in less than six hours.

Seal Coat

Aftcr thc wearing course has been complete as above des-
cribed, experience has proved that it is advisable to seal coat
the surface after all the fencing and equipment has been
installed and before game lines are painted on the pavement.
The seal coating of an asphaltic playground pavement is a
must in order to protect against accelerated deterioration.
The playground surface, unlike a street pavement, gets little
or no rolling traffic (kneading action) to keep the pavement
sealed and alive. It is also an established fact that asphaltic
paving materials are subject to accelerated deterioration:
from exposure to sunlight (actinic rays of the sun) in com-
bination with the lack of surface annealing forces; from
water which is absorbed in the pores of the pavement and
in the hair line cracks which develop during both the rolling

115

and the aging of the pavement; from maintenance vehicle
oil and gasoline drippings; and from various acids includ-
ing lactic acid. These deteriorating factors are present in
varying degrees on every playground surface and can lead
to serious maintenance problems and, whether large or small,
can be continuous and expensive. To make absolute provi-
sion against accelerated deterioration of the asphaltic wear-
ing surface, it is recommended that a water emulsion seal
coat of coal tar pitch, such as Jennite “J-16,” be applied to
the surface.

A high-grade water emulsion seal coat of coal tar pitch
of proven durability and experience record will double the
life of the asphaltic playground surface, as it seals in the
volatile materials and makes the pavement impervious to
water. It also provides a tough and durable wearing surface,
greatly reduces the abrasive condition of the typical
weathered asphaltic surface, and gives a uniform black
satiny finish to the finished playground pavement. Asphalt
surfaces after a few months of use are naturally of a gray
color.

Several types of seal coat materials are available. Stand-
ard liquid asphalt, which is used as a binder in the asphaltic
pavement, has some waterproofing value but is of short life
because of oxidation and its failure to counteract solvents.
The material is slow in curing, tacky and must be sanded if
used. There are synthetic resins which flare unaffected, coal
tar pitch dispersions of inflammable nature which have not
fully proven to be irreversible, and then the best, the water
emulsion coal tar pitches of an irreversible nature.

The water emulsion seal coat product as used by the City
of Cleveland on its park, zoo, airport and recreation area
asphaltic pavement surfaces is in our opinion a proven
product. When properly applied according to the manufac-
turer’s specifications, it assures an impervious and solvent-
resistent surface, has no flow point at any temperature (does
not get sticky when warm, nor crack when cold), assures the
use of pavement within twelve to twenty-four hours, is easy
to apply, requires no heating (it is applied cold just as it
comes from the package), is non-inHamable and can there-
fore be safely stored as a maintenance item, can be brushed,
sprayed or squeegeed with inexpensive equipment, and can
be applied with regular maintenance crews. It can be speci-
fied as follows:

The asphaltic pavement area should be swept thoroughly
by hand or power broom, then flushed with clean water to
remove all small particles of imbedded foreign matter. Ac-
cumulations of oil or grease should be scraped off the pave-
ment; then this section should be cleaned with a strong caus-
tic solution, the residue of which should be thoroughly
flushed away with clean water before application of the
seal coat. Areas that are cleaned should be seal coated the
same day; otherwise it will be necessary to clean the same
area the following day before applying the seal coat material.

Concrete surfaces or other structures should be protected
by satisfactory methods or devices to prevent their being
marred or stained during the application of the seal coat.
The contractor should clean off any seal coat from above
grade surfaces or structures so defaced.

116

The seal coat material should be a water emulsion coalita
pitch, Jennite “J-16,” or approved equal with a field per
formance record of a minimum of five years. The bidde
must: (1) state the brand name of the seal coat produc
he intends to use, along with a statement that the produc
meets all provisions of the material specifications; (2) th.
product’s square yard coverage in gallons for a two-coa
application; and (3) submit an affidavit regarding fiel:
performance of the product, giving name and location 0

' previous job or jobs, the date installed and such othe

pertinent information as may be required.

The seal coat material should be thoroughly agitated i
its container as received, preferably by power mixer or wit
mortar hoe, or as prescribed by the manufacturer, so the
homogeneous consistency of all seal coat in the contains
is assured for proper application. No adulterants of an
nature should be added nor should the product be heate
before application.

0n the prepared surface the seal coat should be applied a
per the manufacturer’s prescribed recommendations. Tw
uniform coatings of the seal coat should be applied at
total thickness as prescribed for the manufacturer’s produc
or equivalent to that provided by two gallons of “J-16
per one hundred square feet or .18 gallons per square yart
After the first coat has set, the second uniform applicatio

of the seal coat should be applied cross-wise to the first a]
plication.

Generally, applications may be made by long handle
twenty-four-inch medium-soft rubber squeegee or lon
handled twenty-four-inch nylon brushes. Allow the seal co:
to cure at least twelve hours before Opening pavement l
playground use.

The seal coat should not be applied when weather is fogg
or rainy (ideal relative humidity is 55 per cent) or whe
atmospheric temperature is below 45° F. (ideal atmospher:
temperature is 77°  or as prescribed by the manufacture

Conclusion

In conclusion, it must be emphatically pointed out th:
roads and vehicular pavements, because of the consta1
traffic rolling over the surfaces, keep the pavement seale
and resilient. The constant rolling pressure of tires h:
a_ kneading action on the asphaltic material which
beneficial. Without question the more rolling action an a
phaltic concrete pavement receives, the better the surfat
and life of the pavement; conversely, the less traffic the pav
ment receives, the more it needs seal coating and compactin,
Through trial and error, which adds up to experience, we 1'
Cleveland have decided that our highly satisfactory asphalt
playground surfaces should be rolled with a three- to fiv
ton roller at least once each season after the pavement h:
been thoroughly heated by the summer sun and during tl
hot spells.

RECREATIG

The Cah'fornia State Department
of Education, through its Depart-
ment of H eaith Education, Physicai
Education and Recreation, has issued
a comprehensive buiietin entitled
“Joint Contractuai Agreements for
Recreation.” It inciudes Iegal provi-
sions authorizing such arrangements
and samples of agreements now in
egect in a iarge number of Caiifornia
cities and counties. The need for
joint pianning is indicated as fol-
iows:

Increased cost of land and develop-
mental sites, buildings and facilities,
and personnel and leadership in recent
ycars demand strict and careful con-
servation of the taxpayer’s dollar. While
it is true that various governing bodies
must plan and construct certain facili-
ties peculiar only to their own use, it is
also very true that a great number of
the proposed items suggested above
could never be provided by a single

agency or governing body. Even if.

provision for some of these facilities
and programs is undertaken by a single
governing body, the very limited avail-
able funds might inhibit or restrict their
I construction or deve10pment, thus only
temporarily providing services or fa-
cilities which may be deemed totally
inadequate to meet the community
needs of the future. The smaller the com-
munity the more apparent it becomes to
make every effort to approach and at-
tempt to solve community problems with
this point of view. Since various
agencies and governing bodies have
primary reSponsibility to certain seg-
ments of the citizenry, at least at certain

times, deve10pment of programs and

Legal Provisions

facilities by single agencies often tends
to make only partial or part-time use
and consequent waste of potentially use-
ful assets to the community.

In the deve10pment of a total com-
munity recreation program, every pos-
sible means of support and finance
should be enlisted for the common good.
Recreation and community services are
a responsibility of a varied group of
agencies and governing bodies. The
modern community-school is an indis-
pensible segment of this solution to
community problems. Notable in Cali-
fornia have been recent trends toward
joint planning and development of sites
for school playground use and instruc-
tion, as well as adjoining city develop-
ment of park and recreational sites. This
alleviates the necessity of either pro-
viding larger acreage and facilities, to
the end that both may be used for the
year-round maximum service to young
and old of the area. Very noteworthy
also is the trend for city government
to join with school districts in the con-
struction of adequate swimming pool
facilities, to the end that priorities of
instruction, water safety, and recrea-
tion may not be displaced by over-
balance of facilities for only the highly
skilled. Since schools need to provide
instruction to all students at both ele-
mentary and secondary levels, as well
as to provide for recreation and com-
petition at the secondary level, for all

but the summer months, and since
school districts already have mainte-
nance and sanitation staffs available for
proper care of swimming pools, it
would be advisable to place new swim-
ming pools on school property. With
joint planning and financing it is then
possible for the other recreation
agencies to utilize this more adequate
facility for night, holiday, weekend and
summer use to insure maximum value
to the community.

Noteworthy also is the trend to build
school facilities to include features for
social recreation such as kitchenettes,
recreation rooms, multi-purpose and
combination facilities for cafeteria,
auditorium, library, and physical edu-
cation. These features are thus readily
available, through joint agreement, to
other community agencies charged with
responsibility to youth and adults. Pro-
vision of outside access to rest rooms
and toilets, showers and dressing rooms
has reduced the necessity of building
separate units at greater public expense.

California has been keeping pace with
the rest of the nation, if not actually
affording leadership, in this noteworthy
development. Leadership of all com-
munity and area governing bodies in
the future should carefully examine
every possible opportunity for joint
planning, to the end that needs of citi-
zens of all ages will be served in the
most economical way possible.

Supervision of College Students in a Recreation Program.

Personnel

Build M Leadership

N many occasions public recreational agencies moan
0 under the burden of increasing the scope of their pro-
gram and serving more people with no appreciable increase
in the budget for additional leadership. Mention volunteers
and the executive and his assistants sigh “not dependable,”
“not worth the trouble,” or other such statements to this
point. Too often municipal departments miss out in an area
of cooperation with local colleges, whereby the students in
the various departments can render community service, gain
valuable experience working with groups, and receive full
or partial credit.

This article deals with supervision of students from
Morgan State College in Baltimore under just such an
arrangement. All of these students are in the department of
education of the school, which is committed “to the task of
training students who intend to become secondary school
teachers.” This phase of the work (laboratory experience)
is designated as community participation, and is part of
Education 202. Each student is required to complete twenty-
hve hours as a minimum, almost assuring regular atten-
dance. This gave us 250 hours of additional leadership one
semester and 285 the next. Right away you can realize how
this relieves the regular staff to tackle difficult problems,
explore new program facets, and to provide the intense
program of community recreation needed in an area of this
type. ,-

Students are referred from the school to the senior super—
visor who in turn makes assignments to the variousocenters
based on residence, listed skills, and major held of study.
This hrst step insures, to a degree, convenience and max-
imum utilization of the student. At this point the center
directors enter the picture in the role of “held supervisors”
to arrange interviews with the students assigned to their
respective centers.

Primarily, supervision must be an educative relationship,
and the quality of the relationship and the tone is set during

the initial interview with the student. He must be made to
feel at ease. This sometimes taxes the supervisor’s or center
director’s interviewing skill, yet its importance is worth the
time and effort. Among other things, the hrst contact should
bring out the student’s recreational interests and something
of his background.

After the interview we hnd it best to have a held-work
orientation period in the center where the student will work.
As there are normally seven to ten students, we use the
group basis and try to do it in one session. The orientation
period covers: facts about the community, function of the
agency, where to hnd sUpplies and other equipment, the role
of the student leader, and methods of supervision and evalua-
tion. Last and probably most important is the question and
answer period during which the staff attempts to answer
any of the students’ questions. We also use this period to
introduce the paid staff to the students, each of the former
taking a topic for discussion.

At the orientation session two important things are given
the student: an advisor from the center staff who becomes
his pillar of inspiration and personal guide, and a folder
which becomes his‘log book and road map. This folder
actually is a major tool of supervision when properly used,
for the student can review his work and plan his course
of action; and the supervisor follows the student by reading
it weekly and sometimes making notes and suggestions in
it. We do not expect the student to keep narrative records for
case or group work interpretation, but we ask them to record:

Date: ............................ ..Hours: ............................ ..Activity: .................. ..
What Happened (brief) : .......................................................................... ..
Behavior Problem: Who? ............ ..What? ............ ..Possible Why? .......... ..
Plans for next session: ...................... ..Materials needed: ...................... ..

In a small measure this helps them to plan ahead and to
understand what they are doing. Credit is allowed for time
spent in report writing. This folder also serves as a basis for
supervisory conferences with the student.

Other methods used in held supervision of these students:
1. Twoogroup seminars a semester.

2. Periodic observation of the student’s work.

RECREATION

3. Monthly conference with the student.
4-. Mid-semester evaluation.
5. Assisting the student in planning or conducting activities.

Throughout the semester close contact and cooperation is
maintained between the college instructors and the field
supervisor, through visits by the instructor. On one occasion
the class instructor was recruited into a paper-craft project
for St. Patrick’s Day by a student he was supposed to be
observing.

At the end of the semester the student reviews his “all
important” folder, summarizes it (preferably on one page)
and leaves his suggestions for improving our service. After
this, field supervisor and student sit down for the final
evaluation using the field report form designed by the
school. This form is returned to the school, and it covers
attendance, growth and development, inadequacies and
strengths, student’s attitudes and so on. Space is also allowed
for grades and additional remarks.

Yes, we have had a great deal of success in using students
as part of their course of study, but we feel it was due to
five time-consuming items:

1. Careful interviewing and assignment.

2. A planned orientation.

3. Close cooperation between school and agency.

4. Supervision with emphasis on vision not super.

5. Harmonious relationship between paid staff and student
leaders.

decrease the value of the program to the school, the agency,
and the student. You see this is a two-way street and as the
students and the school give so must the recreation agency.
In other words, the success of community participation de-
pends on the field supervisor first, then the cooperation
between school and agency. You can understand how this
works when you realize how important supervision is when
viewed as an educational process; and the agency joins
hands with the school to help the individual student.

The agency must provide opportunities for the student to
work with young people, it must provide continuous pro-
fessional supervision, it should give the student a chance to
plan, counsel, lead and, possibly, handle the disciplinary
problems. Last and most important, the agency should plan
a program designed to give the teacher-to-be a practical
knowledge of group processes. When these agency respon-
sibilities are well met, our children will have better teachers
tomorrow, the teachers of the future will have a new view
of public recreation, less hostility, and the center patrons
of today will get a better program.

Orientation: as a Phase of ln-Service Training

There are but few individuals, if any,
who would question the timeliness of
the efforts which are being made to up-
grade the recreation profession. Nor is
there question but that the emphasis
which is being placed on the training
of the recreation worker is a ma or step
toward the attainment of this objective.
The studies and reports of national
committees, the contributions of col-
leges and universities, the recommenda-
tions of professional organizations and,
most potent of all, the combined efforts
of all these groups, will tend toward
the production of personnel who will
improve the stature and influence of
our profession. .

In the field of training, particularly

in the area of in-service training, there
is a phase which frequently is either
overlooked or given but minor or casual
attention. This is the need for a thor-
ough grounding of the individual work-
er in the basic knowledge of his posi-
tion, or what we commonly call his
orientation to his work. This idea is a
result of a long experience as a recrea-
tion executive, and the 'conclusions
which have been arrived at are from ob-
servations made during that time.
Proper orientation is a basic requi-
site for the recreation worker. It equips

him with the knowledge and back-

ground which are essential to his own
development, and it enhances his value
to the organization of which he is a
part. It bridges the span between the
preparatory or pre-service training and
in-service training which are necessary
for his efficiency. It provides the tie
which unites the members of the staff in
a team effort toward the attainment of
the desired goals.

The following brief outline is indica-
tive of the information with which the
new employee should be “indoctri-
nated.”

The Background. We make a distinc-
tion here between the background of
the recreation movement in general
(history, development, philosophy),
which it‘ is assumed has been a part of
the worker’s preliminary training, and
the local or particular background
which pertains to the position he has as-
sumed. It is quite important that he
should know the circumstances and
conditions which affected the organiza-
tion of the department and the succes-
sive steps which have been taken in its
development. He should be familiar,
too, with the difficulties and obstacles
which have been encountered in bring-
ing the organization to its present sta-
tus. This knowledge will serve to guide
him as he progresses in his field of ac-

tivity.

The Set-Up or Organization. Begin-
ning with the legal procedure which
brought the department into being, the
new employee should be educated in

Stephen H. Mahonc

the authoritative structure of the unit 0
which he is becoming a part. He shoul:
be familiar with the local ordinances a1
fecting the department, and he shoul:
have its organizational make-up defi
nitely charted for him. He should hav
a clear picture of the priority of the re
spective phases in the structure, an:
should be aware of the powers, duties
and limitations of each. Manifestly, th
acquisition of this fundamental know]
edge should serve the individua
throughout his tenure in the organiza
tion, not only at his initial level but i:
whatever position he may be place
later. ‘i '

v

The Legal Aspects. Under this heading
we refer to the need of familiarity witl
both the legal background and the 16
gal procedure which affect the routin
of the worker’s position. He should b
made aware of the limitations whicl
are placed on the department’s auth01
ity as well as what powers are given i
under the state, city, or town ordi
nances. He should be made aware of th
instances in which the legal authorit'
must be secured prior to inaugurating
certain propositions and programs. H
should have knowledge of the legal in
formation affecting his position, re
garding: the right to use public monej
for individual prizes; the right t:
charge fees for certain activities; th
right to conduct programs on privat
areas; under what conditions recrea
tional activities can be conducted 01
areas and facilities.of other public de

partments; the circumstances unde

RECREATIOI

which the recreation worker can involve
his department in liability or litigation.

The Standards and Objectives. While

the underlying theory and philosophy
of recreation may be quite uniform, it
is, nevertheless, true that the operation
of the program may be motivated by
varied standards. If the standards set
up by the local recreation authority are
at variance with those of staff members,
a conflict will become evident in the re-
sults obtained. Thus it is essential that
the ideals and standards be uniformly
adepted by the personnel of the organ-
ization. In like manner, the objectives
which are sought in recreation .may
vary. Development of skills, wholesome
use of leisure, character training, social
and civic objectives, development of

leadership—these are some of the goals
toward which recreation administrators
direct their efforts. Toward which ob-
jectives the emphasis is beamed will
determine both the policy and method.

On-the-lob Procedure. Under this cap-
tion, reference is made to the knowl-
edge which is essential to the team work
required for successful administration
of the program. The procedure to be
followed in the matter of relations with
the public is an example of this. The
proper channel of publicity is another
example. The proper procedure for
handling disciplinary cases; the treat-
ment of accidents; the requisitioning of
supplies and equipment-—these are fur-
ther illustrations of the need for uni-
formity among the individuals on the

recreation staff.

Added to these requirements should
be a definite grounding in the more
personal qualities eXpected to be found
in the individual employee. His rela-
tions with fellow employees and with
the patrons of the program, the respon-
sibilities he is expected to assume, the
initiative which he should demonstrate,
and the loyalty to the organization he
serves are illustrations of the qualities
desired. .

Orientation of the recreation-worker
in the basic objectives, requirements,
and procedures involved in his position

is not merely a desirable undertaking—~—

Honored

Leon C. Wheeler, executive secretary
of Townsend Community Center in
Richmond, Indiana, was given a testi-
monial dinner in Detroit recently.

Mr. Wheeler, who was the hrst Negro
playground supervisor appointed by the
Detroit department, directed Brewster
Recreation Center there for sixteen
years and retired from that post eight
years ago. However, time and absence
were not enough, in this case, to sever
the affection and gratitude felt by the
civic leaders of Detroit, and by the men
who, as boys, were encouraged and in-
spired by Leon Wheeler to pursue
professional, athletic, or artistic in-
terests. Among the athletic greats once
coached by him are Eddie Tolan, Joe
Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Jesse
Owens, and others, many of whom at-
tended the banquet.

About a year after he left Detroit, he
accepted the Brewster job in Richmond,
choosing the most difficult of the hve
places suggested by the National Recrea-
tion Association because he felt that
there he could “accomplish more.”
Since he has been in Richmond, he has
helped organize the city-wide Human
Relations Council and the United 0r-
ganizations Council, has served as a
member of the City Planning Commit-
tee, as vice-chairman of the Council of
Social Agencies, chairman of the city-
wide Recreation Committee, member of
the board of directors of the Tubercu-
losis Association, member of the Gov-
ernor’s Committee on Youth and mem-
ber of the Friends Service Job Oppor-
tunity Committee.

John Glover, chairman of the ban-
quet, said, “Seldom does anyone in
social work ever have a chance to
evaluate the results. Leon Wheeler is
one of the few and he should be proud
of what he has accomplished. We’re
mighty proud of him.”

Harold S. Morgan, director of muni-
cipal athletics in the Milwaukee depart-
ment of recreation since 1923, has won
the twenty-second annual Distinguished
Service Award of the Milwaukee Cosmo-
politan Club.

According to Dr. Fred Milke, club
president, “The award is given annually
to an outstanding citizen of Milwaukee
County, who has performed service of
exceptional civic value to the commun-
ity. The contribution of time and talents
well over and above the usual respon-
sibilities is recognized.”

Mr. Morgan has organized and di-
rected harmonica bands in orphanages,
organized a bicycle safety program and
promoted bicycle hostel trips. The youth
movements with which he has been in-
volved are the National Youth Hostel,
the YMCA Boys Work Committee, the
Wisconsin Home and Farm School, Red
Cross, Veteran’s Administration, and
many others.

Harold Morgan is indeed an out-
standing citizen and we congratulate
him for his thirty years of service and
for having received the Distinguished
Service Award.

College Activities

0 The members of Calico and Boots,
the Colorado University square dance
club were hosts to about six hundred
square and folk dancei's from all cor-
ners of Colorado and from Wyoming
and Nebraska during their seventh
annual Western Hoedown. The two-day
festival was held in November, in the
university’s new three-million-dollar
student union memorial building.

This festival is one of several of its
kind held during the school year. Each
major college in Colorado has an active
square dance club on its campus; each
club sponsors an annual square-dance
festival during the year. Some of the
affairs are planned for one night only;
the two-day festivals usually include
an afternoon workshop during which
new couple dances and square combina-
tions are taught by visiting callers.

o A “Dawn Dance” is featured by St.
Lawrence College, New York. This
starts at 4 A.M.; instructors help with
entertainment and with breakfast. A
similar all-campus “Rise and Shine”

party is held at State Teachers College,
New Paltz, New York.

0 A noon program, called “Melody
Manner,” has been set up by Ohio State
Union, to introduce any professional
entertainers who happen to be appear-
ing in the neighborhood. The union ob-
tains the permission of the lnusicians’
union, and notifies the theatrical agent
that the performance will be free.

“Recreational Music”

Because a recreation director needs a
spccial background in music to make
the best use of it in his program—
whether it be on a playground or in a
community center—the University of
Illinois School of Music now offers
“Recreational Music.” This course is
required of all recreation majors.

The instructor, Max Kaplan, is a mem-
ber of both the department of sociology
and the school of music. His students
survey the types of musical activities
available for recreation activities. They
learn how these activities may be
incorporated into other features of
the recreation program, such as dram-
atics, arts and crafts, social events, festi-
vals and pageants.

FEBRUARY 1954-

Deatlline for Tolerance

Fraternities on the campus of Colum-
bia University were given an edict last
fall—that they must end discriminatory
practices and admit all applicants on
merit rather than race or religion by
October 1, 1960. By that date all cam-
pus organizations must see that all dis-
criminatory clauses have been removed
from their constitutions.

Inventory of Colleges

A national inventory of colleges and
universities reporting professional
training in recreation is now underway.
The study was approved by the National
Advisory Committee on Recruitment,
Training and Placement, of the National
Recreation Association, at its annual
meeting held during the Congress in
Philadelphia. It is being made in order
to bring up-to-date and to establish a
more valuable list of colleges and
universities reporting major curricu-
lums in rccreation.

Campus Briefs

0 “The College Union Director and

His Preparation” is the subject of a
doctoral thesis, by Theodore Kohler of
Columbia University, which has re-

cently been completed. A survey of sixty
unions was made to determine the
duties of a college union director and
the personal and professional qualifi-
cations necessary for such a position
. . . Andrew Wolf, of Wisconsin Uni-
versity, has written on “Aims and Func-
tions of College Union Programs.”

0 The old saying that human nature
is best studied in a game of poker is re-
ceiving scientific investigation in a
course conducted by Professor R.
Creighton Buck, at the University of
Wisconsin, in the theory of games. The
more we know about the theory of
games the more necessary it is to change
our concepts of civilization. Military
strategy, economics may be studied and
developed on the basis of knowledge of
games, as is seen in the U. S. Army’s
“operational research.”

0 Although college “unions” as centers
of friendship and recreation for stu-
dents have been increasingly popular,
what appears to be the first course
beamed toward union management

was introduced at Michigan State late
in 1952. Preparation for management
of residence halls and hospital manage-
ment is included. Dr. Earl Thompson,
long director of residence halls at the
University of Illinois, organized the
curriculum.

0 LettietConnell, graduate in recrea-
tion from San Francisco State College,
is the voice of “Miss Busy Bee” in the
“Brother Buzz” TV Show on the Coast
and constructs many of the puppets
used in the show. “Brother Buzz” re-

ceived an award from Ohio State
Institute.

Fellowships

In keeping with its policy of support-
ing activities which may contribute to
international understanding, the Ford-
Foundation is initiating a program of
scholarships and fellowships for young
men and women of ability who wish to
begin or to continue study of the Soviet
Union or the peripheral Slavic and
East European areas.

forms are available from: The Ford
Foundation, (Overseas Training and

New Party Service

A new service for the public has been
added to the Menlo Park recreation de-
partment, California.

A file of party ideas has been made
up by including ideas for games, decor-
ations and some menus for seasonal
parties, costume parties and parties
with unusual themes. These ideas have
been clipped from leading magazines
and recreation publications and filed
according to age and occasion. The
ages range from pre-school through
adult, including children, teens and
young adult. Books and pamphlets of
parties giving techniques are also in
the file. Everyone is welcome to take
advantage of this service; however, the
files may not be taken from the office.

Delinquency in Japan

According to the Asian Games Bulle-
tin, published in Manila, Japan is ex-
pected to send the largest delegation to
the coming Second Asian Games in that
country. Recent arrivals from Japan
noted that the Japanese people “are one
hundred per cent behind sports as a
primary means of wiping out crime and
juvenile delinquency.” Tokyo, with a
population of seven million, registers
an all-time low in crime and delin-
quency because the people flock to the
playgrounds more often than to movie
houses or elsewhere. It was also learned
that Japan is employing the most
modern and latest sports facilities used
in European and American countries.

Expansion

0 Milwaukee plans to spend $533,800
for playground construction and im-
provement during 1954 according to a
report submitted by Clarence Beernink,
coordinator of capital improvements.
Funds have been allotted for work at
thirty playfields in all areas of the city.
Among the major projects, Donald B.
Dyer, director of the Department of

124

Municipal Recreation, announced the
following: Cass Street playground, the
construction of shelter building and
toilets, improvement of grounds, lights,
and apparatus. An amount of $152,500
will be used for the purchase of real
estate to enlarge four playgrounds and
improve them. Most of the other proj-

ects are for surfacing, drainage, back-
stops, and lights.

0 Following the dedication last July, of
their new one-thousand-acre camping
area on Sharpe Reservation, four miles
from Fishkill, New York, the Herald
Tribune Fresh Air Fund has announced
plans for the construction of three new
camps, with the eventual addition of
two more. They state that their objec-
tives are three-fold in the development
of this area:

1. Recreation—The extension of our
facilities to thousands of needy boys
and girls from the crowded tenements
of New York City. Each camp will ac-
commodate 144 children for two-week
periods, or total of 576 for summer.

2. Conservation—Through a cooper-
ative plan with the Dutchess County Soil
Conservation District, the area is to be
carefully cultivated for land use, soil
and water conservation. Good conser-
vation practices are taught in the camp-
ing program.

3. Beautification—Through the work
of our camp planner and our architect,
each new structure will fit into the nat-
ural landscape and the entire area will
be developed with a view to the aes-
thetic possibilities of natural terrain,
water, and woodland.

Personal Note

0 Mrs. Katrine Hooper, the new spon-
sor for the National Recreation Asso-
ciation in Dedham, Massachusetts, is a
vivacious, widely versatile person whose
creative activities rated a feature story
by Kathleen Cannell in the Christian
Science Monitor a couple of years ago.
Said the Monitor in part:

“Spinning her multiple careers with
the deftness of a juggler, dynamic Kat-
rine Amory Hooper keeps on adding
new activities without losing her bal-
ance. Perhaps this came from her long
association with the dance, as per-
former, pedagogue, and producer.

“Or it may be because she’s a Yankee
from ‘way back.’ Mrs. Hooper com-
bines teaching dance notation and his-
tory of art at Boston Conservatory of
Music, lnc., with painting, writing, de-
signing décors for stage and interior,
happy homemaking and various social
and civic duties. . . .”

Juvenile Delinquency

o “Juveniles Not a Problem in Berke-
ley,” read the headlines of an article
in the Berkeley Daily Gazette, Novem-
ber 20, 1953. A statement to this effect

had been made by Police Inspector A.
E. Riedel who is a recognized juvenile
authority in that city. It was prompted,
he said, by recent articles in leading
national magazines which reported thal
delinquency over the country is on the
upswing. “The only mounting delin-
quency problem,” he stated, “exists in
the minds of adults who are looking for
an excuse for their own shortcomings.”
He declared that youngsters now are no
different from those when their elders
were young, and that figures have
swelled only because of improved sta-
tistical techniques. “Berkeley has no
major problem of juvenile delinquency
and never has had,” he said. “Sure, we
have a few juvenile delinquents, but
we’ve always had them. This is nothing
new or startling.”

Actual statistics gathered by Berke-
ley’s juvenile authorities over the past
seven years show an increase in the

number of cases of less than one per
cent.

Mr. Riedel called for a “level-headed
approach” to matters relating to juve-
nile delinquency. As to the future, he
laid the responsibility squarely on
parents’ shoulders. “For many years
there has been a continuous vigilance
by police,” he said. “Berkeley is an
alert community and has provided good
character-building agencies including
recreational facilities and a fine educa-
tional program.

“It is up to Berkeley’s future parents
to accept their full obligation as citizens
by continuing to provide these essential
community elements which in turn pro-
vide a wholesome environment for
growing youth.”

0 In Ayer, Massachusetts, according to
the United Press in the New York
World-Telegram and Sun of November
12, 1953, a small-town cop who was “a
hellion myself once” has eliminated lo-
cal juvenile delinquency by means of
hobby clubs. He is Police Chief Ernest
L. Downing, a World War I veteran
and one-time semipro baseball pitcher.
He has launched innumerable hobby
groups among trouble makers instead
of arresting them, using the help of
high-school boys to find out what in-
terests the culprit who has come to his
attention. All members of the high-
school football squad are his deputies,
and any youngster in town may be made
a special policeman for a special occa-
sion.

According to the neWSpaper account,
the chief offers the following five tips:

1. Keep every promise you make to a kid.

2. Show a youngster you’re interested in
him.

3. Get a boy outdoors. He’s better off hold-
ing a fishing rod than a pool cue.

4. Teach a boy that a policeman is his
friend.

5. Every boy is interested in something.
Find out what it is and guide him in it.

F rontiers—Fun With Science For
Camp Fire Girls

Camp Fire Girls, Incorporated, 16

East 48th Street, New York 17. Pp. 119.
$1.00.

This is one of the many books we
wish we’d thought of first! It may have
been prepared for Camp Fire Girls,
bless their hearts!, but any club or
recreation leader who doesn’t get a copy
is missing one of the finest collections
of program material we’ve seen in a
long time. Girlsw—and boys too—will
love the new and interesting projects.
Don’t fail to get a copy. Highly recom-
mended—Virginia Musselman, Pro-
gram Service, National Recreation As-
sociation.

Land and Water Trails

Ellsworth J aeger. The Macmillan
Company, New York 11. Pp. 227. $2.95.

Ellsworth J aeger, who is Hayes Pro-
fessor of Science at the Buffalo Museum
of Science, and who began his career
as a commercial artist, is well known
for his books, articles and lectures on
nature subjects. He now writes a “how-
to” book on the enjoyment of outdoor
life which, as usual, is plentifully illus-
trated and effectively clarified with his
helpful sketches. A “Water Travel”
section deals with the sailing of an out-
rigger log, a raft, the handling of a
canoe in various types of water (and
canoe strokes), portaging, skiffs,
scows, keelboats, fiatboats. Other sec-
tions cover: saddle and bridle tips;
knots and lashings; wilderness critters
and critter signs, and even insect pests.
Mr. Jaeger closes with a plea for the
protection of America’s wilderness. Any
camper who is planning to travel in
wild places will do well to own this

book.

Covering the Leisure-time Field

Leaders of club groups will be in-
terested in the five hundred activities
suggested and described in this how-to-
do “guide for group leaders and mem-
bers” in the planning of an effective
club program. The book stresses ac-
tivities which provide opportunity for
individual initiative as well as for the
identification of personal interests with
group interests—through the demo-
cratic processes. By electing the kind of
club they wish to have, gathering in-
formation, organizing projects, and
participating in group discussion, stu-
dents enjoy a satisfying democratic ex-
perience and achieve that sense of
security which comes from belonging to
a group.

Although slanting her material as a
handbook for school clubsw—teachers,
administrators and leaders—the author
presents much of value to the recreation
leader in whatever setting. Of two pre-
vious books by Miss Thompson, High
Times carries seven hundred sugges-
tions for social activities. The Library
Journal said of it: “A gold mine for all
who work with teens.”

Quizzeroo

K. V. Reed. Popular Mechanics Press,
200 East Ontario Street, Chicago 11.
Pp. 110. $1.00.

Quizzes are the things these days and
more fun than a “barrel of monkeys”—
especially for young adults or other
adult groups. Without doubt, radio and
television programs are responsible for

their popularity and for the rash of .-

quiz books now on the market. None of
the latter is more practical than Quiz-
zeroo, however, and many such publica-
tions are not as good—for use with
groups. The questions included here are
not too hard, for one thing, and are
different enough under each topic to
make the game really interesting, as
well as exciting—with plenty of chances
to win.

The first part of the book contains
official rules and suggestions for con-

ducting quizzes for two or more per-
sons, for playing quiz solitaire, and for
keeping score. Several pages of coupons
for quiz points are bound into the back.
The game can be played in cars and
trains, on picnics and hikes, on rainy
days in camp, at parties—or in the
home. It presents more than one dollar’s
worth of fun!

Math Is Fun

Joseph Degrazia. Emerson Books, In-
corporated, 251 West 19th Street, New
York 11. Pp. 159. $2.75.

A book of brain teasers, tricks and
puzzles for the mathematically minded!
N 0 knowledge beyond elementary al-
gebra is required to solve most of them,
and many call for only simple arith-
metic. However, their solution does re-
quire ingenuity and original thinking.
As, for instance: “If it takes a bicyclist
four minutes to ride a mile against the
wind but only three to return with the
wind at his back, how long will it take
him to ride a mile on a calm day? Three
and a half minutes, you probably figure.

Sorry, you are wrong.”

The magic

1““ Li

whispers...

I;
f
f a:-

When Grandpa tucked you between his knees, you
knew you were going to listen again to his wonderful
watch—to hear its magic tick . . . tick . . . tick . . .

And as you, listened, those measured whispers of time
shut away the world, leaving you close to Grandpa,
secure in his love.

From fathers and mothers to sons and daughters
passes the lifeblood of happiness-security. The

privilege of providing it for those we love can be
found only in a land like ours.

And another wonderful thing is this: By realizing
this privilege of freedom for ourselves, we achieve
the security of our country. For, think—the strength
of America is simply the strength of one secure
home touching that of another.

 

 

Saving for security is easy! Here’s a sav-
ings system that really works—the Payroll
Savings Plan for investing in United
States Savings Bonds.

This is all you do. Go to your company’s
pay ofiice, choose the amount you want to
save—a couple of dollars a payday, or as
much as you wish. That money will be set
aside for you before you even draw your
pay. And automatically invested in Series
E Savings Bonds which are turned over

to you.

If you can save only $3.75 a week on the
Plan, in 9 years and 8 months you will have
$2,137.30. For your sake and your family’s,
too, how about signing up today?
