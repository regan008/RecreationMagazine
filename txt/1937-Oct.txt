Recreation and the Building
of Self-Confidence

MANY HAVE come to doubt themselves, their neighbors, the
power of combined neighbors to work out the world’s
problems.

' There is need to help each child, each man to find the activity
he carries on supremely well. Most individuals excel in at least one
activity. Perhaps the man is an unusual hsherman. Perhaps there

is one flower he grows earlier or better than anyone else. Perhaps he ,

has a gift with pets. Maybe there is a musical instrument that he
can play supremely well. The helping of individuals to find what
they do supremely well helps to build faith in 5“themselves and some-
times faith in the world in general.

The world is so big and knowledge has grown apace. No one
person can know very much of all there is to know. Many become
discouraged. ‘To help a man in his free time to master some one
thing is to help him to have a little better understanding of all that
vast realm of experience that he will never have hours enough to
find out about for himself in one lifetime. To master some one thing

a helps him to realize that the rest of the world within limits is also

masterable.

Ability to do one thing well, with or without recognition of
this ability by one's neighbors of the moment, gives a person an
inner sense of power, of status, that is most important to his

continued growth.

Much Ado About Doing

, HE STUDY outlined in this
Tarticle is concerned with
recreational interests and
needs of young people in Los Angeles, California,
and the destructive and constructive results
achieved in meeting the interests and needs. The
sources of the data are a Recreation Interests
Questionnaire entitled “What do you do and what
would you like to do when you are not in school,”
a study of delinquencies of youth entitled “Youth’s
New Day,” issued by the Los Angeles County
Coordination Council, original studies supervised
by the author to discover types of juvenile of-
.fences, and original studies of the community re—
sources and of the program of the Department of
Playground and Recreation, as well as material
from various juvenile and recreational agencies.
The data and conclusions are not entirely compre-
hensive or scientific, yet the material is sufficiently
such to be indicative, however, and valuable ac—
cordingly as’ a guide in our future efforts.

Part One

I. What Do They Do and “Hart Do They Want?

Some 17,000 young people of the Junior and
High School age were given a questionnaire to fill
out on their interests and wants. Of the 17,056
students replying (the number approached) about
half were boys. Six Junior High Schools, nine
High Schools and one Junior College were
studied. The findings are tabulated or indicated

below:
A. WHAT Do THEY DO?

Shifting Interests

The peak of interest in
playground activity comes
for boys in the ninth grade
and for girls in the eighth
grade, the boys showing a
more marked increase dur-
ing the seventh and eighth
grades than the girls. The
beginning of the slump in
playground interests coin—
cides with the physical
change from childhood to
adolescence, accounting for
the earlier peak of girls’

National Recreation Association

This study was made by Mr.Grant when he was
a member of the stat? of the Los Angeles De-
partment of Playground and Recreation' serv-
ing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Sur-
veys of the Los Angeles Research Committee.
The sources of the data are a Recreation ln-
terests Questionnaire entitled "What do you
do and what would you like to do when you are
not in school": a study of delinquencies of
youth under the title "Youth's New Day.'I is-
sued by the Los Angeles County Coordination
Council; original studies supervised by the

as material from various juvenile and rec-
reational agencies in the community.

playground interest and the
abrupt change of playground
habits during the shift from
Junior to Senior High School. Following the peak
there is rapid decrease in attendance for the next
two years. Thereafter an upturn is noted due
largely to interest in recreational activities boys
and girls may enjoy together. All types of social
recreation hold increased interest from this
point on. The slump indicates changing interests;
old playground activities are thought childish and
new interests are not yet formed. The slump goes
deeper for boys due, perhaps, to occupations taken
up, and trips, “adventuring” and other activities
not open to girls.

Interest in Various Types of Activity

Sports with social interest and values command
more interest. Tennis and swimming show a
steadily rising curve of interest, mounting with
age. This type of interest increased over three
times between grades 7 and 12, and is so steady
that, knowing the age distribution of children and
youth in any one district, economic factors being
constant, it would be possible to plan the quantity
of facilities needed to satisfy this interest.

Traditional activities show decrease with age.
Boys’ activities such as baseball and football show
a gradual and marked decrease, more marked than
in other activities, so that the general rise in inter-
est toward the end of High School seems due to
the influence of social recreation activities. The
curve for “playground
sports” starts down for
boys in the eighth grade
and girls in the seventh
grade. This may be due
to the fact that boys and
girls do not desire these
activities any longer or
their wants in that regard
have been met. Our con—
clusion is that the latter is
true and little program-
ming is needed in this field
to meet their needs. In the
eighth grade football, bas—
ketball, playground ball
and handball all show a

peak of participation (for boys) and interest lags
thereafter in the order named, football. holding
the interest longer and handball the shortest time.

Interests of twelfth grade boys and girls were
studied because this is the age at which school in-
Huence decreases with graduation and the respon-
sibility of the public recreation department ac-
cordingly increases.

I. In athletic team sports. The following table
is based on the number interested per 1000 in the
twelfth grade as are the tables which follow, un-
less otherwise indicated:

Activity Girls Boys
Basketball . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 473 469

Volley Ball . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 432 209

Handball . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74 336

Baseball . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 41 483

2. In sports more or less socialized in nature:
Activity Girls Boys
Tennis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 815 461

Swimming . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 665 654

Croquet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 126 71

Paddle Tennis . . . . . . . . . . .. 122 81

We observe again that girls mature more rapidly in
general in interest in socialized aCtIVItIES than boys, al-

though swimming and archery strike a uniform response. '

3. In purely social activities. Social dancing is
now enjoyed by 485 girls out of every 1000 in the
twelfth grade, or nearly one half, While only 344
boys, slightly over a third, enjoy it. The more rapid
social advancement of girls is noted here again.

4. In cultural activities. Interest in these activi-
ties lags behind, but with increased interest over
that shown in lower grades. Boys surpass the
girls only in interest in handcraft.

5. Summary of twelfth grade interests. The
most popular activities for boys and girls are
given in their order of preference: I. Girls-—
Team games of basketball, volley ball and hockey;
socialized sports of tennis, swimming and arch-
ery, and the cultural activities of dramatics, in-
strumental music and vocal music. 2. Boys—
Team games of basketball, baseball and handball;
socialized sports of swimming, tennis and archery,
and cultural activities of instrumental music,
handcrafts and dramatics.

The most readily and adapted activities for CO-
recreational participation among those listed are

   
    

tennis,‘ swimming, dramatics, instrumental mus
and only those team games not involving intensi

effort and personal contact. l

IlIost Rapidly Increasing Participation Intere
of Boys and Girls from Grades 7—12

Girls' participation interest increase for vario
activities per 1000 was tennis, 658-815; hock
152-244; archery, 124—210. Other. activities : .
not show increased interest in this age range, '
dicating that social and cultural interests had b
previously stimulated and physical activities w
coming to the fore.

Boys' participation interest increase per I
students was tennis 429-461 and dancing 154-3
All other activities show a decrease of interest n
1000. The “socialized emphasis” of both of th
activities would indicate that this phase of I
development had been delayed’longer than for gi

, 3. Conclusions from Comparison of r‘Participm
lion Interests” and “Playground Wants” of Boys
——5eve-nth —- Twelfth Grades. Assuming in gen-
eral that where participation decreases, adequate
provision is made for that “inter-
est,” and that where a “want” is
expressed, facilities and program
are not at hand to satisfy that
“want,” the following guide to
the enlargement of ‘facilities and
program is suggested:

a. Boys’ activities needing no
further promotion: Volley—
ball, playground ball, bas-
ketball, handball, baseball,

l track and football. (Those
dropping farthest in prefer—
ence rank are listed first.)

b. Boys’ activities needing
further promotion: Pup-
petry, dramatics, tennis,
swimming, handcraft, wres—
tling, boxing, dancing, tum-

bling, hockey and archery. (Those rising most in
the preference list are given last.)

c. Activities in which there is no change in pref-
erence: Art and soccer. Those changing less
than five places in rank were paddle tennis,
vocal music, instrumental music, croquet and
storytelling.

4. Conclusion from Comparison of “Participa—
tion Interests” and Playground Wants of Girls—
Seventh-——Twelfth Grade.

a. Girls’ activities needing no further promo—
tion: Playground ball, volley ball, handball,
basketball, soccer and baseball—— (All are
“playground sports.”) (Those dropping
farthest in preference rank are listed first.)

b. Girls’ activities needing further promotion:

given last.)

c. Activities in which there is no change in
preference ranks. Story-telling and croquet.

II. To What Do They Belong and to What
Do They Want to Belong? I

The recreation interest questionnaire also asked
to what organization the students belonged and to
what organizations they would like to belong. A
study of the replies follows:

A. To WHAT Do THEY BELONG?

To what do they belong?—Boys. Out of the
8,245 boys answering the questionnaire 3,034 or

36% were members of “National Character Build—
ing” organizations and 1954 held membership in
school, church or private clubs. While there is
some duplication, it is fairly safe to assume that
approximately half of the total group belongs to
some club organization.

best “joiners,” with the eighth

grade in the lead in national

boys’ organizations. It is interesting to note that
the peak of interest in the school, church'and
private clubs comes in the eleventh grade. Com—
parison of the figures below leads us to observe
that the program of the “National Character
Building” organizations appeals particularly to
the Junior High School age and the other clubs
with special activity interests and Social activities
appeal increasingly to the High School boy.

girls studied, 1,338 or 15% were members of
“National Character Building” organizations. In

contrast with 36% of the boys’ group being so
served, it is obvious that girls’ needs have been
slighted in this field. However, 412 girls in every
1000 or 41% belong to school, church or private
clubs.

The Ages of Most Active Club Members—Gir‘

Here again it is discovered that the Junior Hi
School girl, like her brother, is the best “joiner'

of the “National Character Building Club” at th
eighth grade level, while the peak of interest i

. other groups (school, church and private) is y

the tenth grade, one year before that of h'
brother. The earlier development of social inter
ests in girls may be responsible for this fact sinb
these club programs are relatively social in eri'i‘
phasis. The program of the “National Charctg,

Building” organizations for girls as well as boys
does not seem to fit the needs of the High School
age. It is more obviOUs with girls than boys.

_ l B. To WHAT Do THEY WANT TO BELONG?

About half the boys and half the girls belong
' 0 clubs of one kind or another. What of the
«Lin half? To what kind of clubs do they wish

1 to belong?

Clubs to Which Boys Wish to Belong. 45 per
cent of the total group expressed a desire to join
additional groups. The number per 1000 wishing

to join specific clubs follows:

Y.M.C.A. (all organizations) . . . . . . . . . . . .. 195

Boy Scouts (Sea Scouts and Clubs) . . . . . . . 156

Church Clubs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

In studying the questionnaire it was found that
there were about two-thirds as many requests for
Sea Scout membership as for Boy Scout member-
ship, indicating the possibility of enlarged service
there. The large numbers interested in Y.M.C.A.
clubs speaks for! the popularity of this group.
The lack of interest in church groups probably
indicates this need is adequately met or that this
type of organization fails to appeal to boys. (It
should be noted, however, that many churches
sponsor “National Character Building” organiza-
tion clubs.)

Clubs to 'Which Girls Wish to Belong. 47 per
cent of the total group of girls expressed a desire
. to join additional clubs. The number per 1000
. girls wishing to join specihc clubs follows:

' The evident need for additional club service
through the “National Character Building” agen-
cies is noted.

C. WHY DON’T THEY BELONG?

Reason for non-membership given by boys were

It would be interesting to know the real inter-
ests of boys not interested in joining a club. It
is regrettable in 367 cases that no group was to be
found in the immediate community. The large

number who can’t afford it or who haven’t been
asked is significant.

Reasons for non-membership given by girls were

5,452 in number. The major reasons are tabu-
lated below. '

In general there is a close correlation between
the answers of boys and girls. The larger num-
ber of girls unable to join because of work at
home, school work, coupled with “no time,” might
indicate that girls are more tied by responsibility
and duties than their brothers.

Part Two .

Destructive Results When Leisure Time Needs
of Youth Are Not Met and Steps Being Taken
to Remedy the Same

Space does not admit a full analysis of this sec-
tion, but a few interesting findings are listed below.

The study reveals forty-six boys out of every
1000 boys (5-17 years of age) and seventeen
girls (5-17 years of age) out of every 1000 have
been designated “delinquent” or “problem” chil-
dren. In other words three out of every 100 boys
and girls have failed to adjust; ninety-seven have
succeeded in adjusting to our society.

Eighty-five per cent of delinquents in one in-
stitution had had no constructive play life.

Boys and girls I6 years of age show the great-
est number of arrests.

34.7% of juvenile offences take place in the
street.

The time when most juvenile offences take place
are 3-4 o’clock in the afternoon (when school is
out) and 6-7 o’clock (after the evening meal).
Most crimes are committed on Saturday and
Sunday.

(Continued on page 448)

Shorter Hours tor Shut-ins

1. 0L' KNOW there are
many different cases
of handicapped chil-

dren. Some can attend our
schools for cripples, then
there are those who are so
handicapped they cannot at-
tend school. But now 'they
are not neglected. They get
their school instruction right
at home and are graded ust
as the youngsters that go to
school. But then our city
doesn’t stop at that. Our
Recreation Department has
seen to it that our home-
bound-shut-ins are not for-
gotten. A program of ac-
tivities has been arranged so
these shut-ins have been
given the chance for just
what their little hearts have longed for most. It
seems nearly too good to be true.

“If you could just stop in and see what it really
means. Imagine a real instructor teaching the
boys and girls aeroplane modeling; a real in-
structor teaching them art, music, or anything
they want to do most. My boy was ill this week
and couldn’t have his teacher or recreational in-
structor, and although he had to be in bed the
‘Story Lady’ called to read to him and tell stories.
Now I really don’t think my letter can make you
realize what it all means to us mothers. That
these children are not forgotten means so much
in life.”

So writes the mother of one of Akron’s physi-
cally handicapped children to a newspaper editor,
concerning the recreation program now being car-
ried on in the homes of fifty boys and girls who
are too crippled to leave their homes, even in a
wheel-chair,‘except on rare occasions.

Thousands of words have been written and
spoken about the need of Organized recreation for
children and adults, and; nearly as many dollars
are being spent for- supervision,_ facilities and
equipment, but too little has been done to shorten
the too-long, too-many leisure hours of the handi-
capped person confined to a life of four walls.

Some Sports and Their Development

By AGATHA VARELA
Washington, D. C.

HATEVER THE DAMAGE, great or little, caused
by football today, it is at least confined to

the players and' the goal posts! Five or six‘

hundred years ago the limits were much broader.
In Merrie England, in those good old days of
manly sport, the teams, followed by old men,
young men, maids and matrons, and a motley as-
sortment of children and dogs, would go plung-
ing after the ball through village streets, up one
and down the next, in a mad, hair-raising scram-
ble which? caused such havoc and destruction that
terrified merchants were forced to close their
shops while a game was in progress. The worthy
merchants protested the game so long and loudly
because of the damage it did their trade and
wares, that in I 314 Edward III forbid the play-

ing of it.

As the Romans Played Football

Yet in all justice to football, its history contains
many less violent‘and more glamorous pages. The
Florentines of the Renaissance, in particular,
played a brand very different from that of the
English. They developed their own variety, an
elegant and showy sport in which only noblemen
were permitted to indulge, which was preceded
and followed by a parade of the players and their
attendants, all garbed in costly silks and velvets,
and which was rendered pleasanter for them by
frequent rest periods during the game, when, with
a happy ignorance (if training rules, they would
refresh themselves by eating sweetmeats and sip-
ping wine, and would bask contentedly in the ad-
miring smiles of the lovely ladies of Florence!

But the game of their football antecedents, the

} Romans, showed little of this re-

 

With this issue we begin the publi-
cation of a series of articles by
Miss Varela on the historical back-
ground of some of our most popular
sports, some of which were known

in other countries hundreds of years
ago. The interesting development
of football and hockey is described
this month. Facts about archery,

tennis and polo will be presented
in later issues of RECREATION.

 

it. With the Greeks, who are generally considered
to have originated it, football was far more popu-
lar than with the Romans, and was, according to
all accounts, even wilder and more uncouth. The
greatest of the Greeks was one Aristonico Caristo
whose prowess the Athenians forever immortal—
ized by raising a statue in his honor.

Football in England

In England, football had rather a gruesome be-
ginning, for tradition holds that the first English
football was the skull of a Danish invader which
the playful youths of, Chester were fond of kick—
ing about. From this simple start the game de-
veloped into the public menace against which
Edward III issued his famous edict. Other later
kings forbid football more because they wanted
their subjects to use all their spare time practic-
ing archery in order to hght in the wars, than out
of any concern for the public safety. Their edicts
were calmly ignored, however, and football con-
tinued to be played with gusto. In many villages
the custom began of holding big games annUally
on Shrove Tuesday and these games took a variety
of quaint forms. At Scone and .Melrose, the bach-
elors played the married men. At Inverness, the
old maids were teamed against
the matrons. In one little Suf-

"One peaceable citizen of London
described an early game of foot-
ball thus‘: 'For as concerning foot-
ball playing. I protest it may rather
be called a friendly kind of fight I
than a play or recreation; a bloody
and murthering practice than a
friendly sport or pastime.”

   

fmement and elegance. A crude,
{rough sport, it was not indulged
in to any great extent by the
citizens as a whole, but we have
word that one of the greatest
of the emperors, Caesar Augus-
tus, was very fond of playing

villages, even today in some remote corners of
England the people still delight in taking part
once a year in the crude rough variety of football
which their ancestors so enjoyed.

Seeing the impossibility of preventing football,
the crown at last recognized it, and some mem-
bers of royalty even came to enjoy it. Mary,
Queen of Scots, the greatest royal fan of whom
we read, delighted in organizing her retinue into
teams which played impromptu games for her
amusement. It was her son, James I, who first
sanctioned football playing in England, and in con-
sequence there immediately began a variety of
football in public schools which gradually develop-
ed into the line game of Rugby that the English
so enjoy today.

The original Rugby was solely a kicking game,
but when, in 1823, a lad named Ellis inadvertently
ran with the ball, such a storm of controversy
arose over the problem of “to run or not to run,”
that at last the two schools of thought on the sub-
ject separated and those wanting only kicking
formed the London Football Association, and
those allowing carrying continued to call their
game Rugby. Visitors to Rugby School today
may see a small inscription upon a stone wall
which reveals the pride of the old school in the

deed of her famous son, Ellis.

“This stone

In the United States

In the'United States, the early collegiate games
were very similar to the English Association
games. Crude and rough like early football in the
mother country, it was slowly but surely tamed
and civilized by the great colleges that took it up.

Yale has the first record of an organized game i

which occurred in 1840 between the Frosh and
the Sophs. In the early games, lack of rules and
originality 0n the part of coaches and teams
caused incidents so amusing that football fans
have been chuckling over them ever since. The
most famous were probably those that concerned
the lads who greased their pants so that it was
impossible to tackle them; the boys who embroid—
ered footballs on their jerseys that couldn’t be
distinguished from the real pigskin, and the en-

terprising player who made a touchdown with t
ball hidden under his jersey.

Those were the days when American footb
was in its infancy, yet in the comparatively sho
time since the middle of the last century, t W
United States has developed such a brand of pl
that it forces one to the conclusion that in sp'
of all of the entertaining features of football .
played by other countries in other centuries,
was all merely the background and preparati '
for the climax of football history, our gr
American game of today.

I-Ipckey

  
  
   
   
    
  

An amazing fact which might well be added
Ripley’s collection of “Believe It or Not,” is th d
the ancient Greeks played hockey. The proof I
this was disclosed in 1922 by some archaeologis
who, excavating near Athens, uncovered a ped
tal which they identified as having been constru
ed by Themistocles about  B. C. and on whi
are carved some boys playing hockey. Two wi
crooked sticks are bending over the ball ready f I
the bully, and four others are standing in positi ;
to receive it. Even down to small details the ga
is apparently identical with our modern one.

The Romans also played a game very similar
ours, using the same curved stick, but playi .
with a leather ball instead of a wooden one. Y :
in spite of the undoubted connection betwe
these ancient games and our modern one, it
impossible, because of the thousands of interve
ing years, to discover their true relationship.

Hockey in Great Britain

Actually, we can trace our hockey only back to i
more recent ancestors, the Scotch, Irish, and En
lish games. In these three countries hockey w
called by a different name,but was played in almo
exactly the. same way. The Irish called their ga
“hurley,” the Scotch named theirs “shinty,” an
the English, “bandy.” Records reveal that t
Irish played as early as the second century A. ‘ '
and that although'nine usually played on a sid
an unlimited number could take part. A quain
old Irish legend describes a game in which one 1 -
of superhuman strength was matched against '3
hundred and fifty. He won a goal, thereby great
annoying his opponents en masse, who proceed
to attack him. He managed to kill fifty, but w
overcome in the end, and his head was knock

off by a hockey stick! I?

' In Scotland the game
| seems to have been a little
less blood-thirsty and a
reat deal more aristocra-
gc, for at one time a Scotch
king played. He was Alex-
_ der the Fierce who reign-
$ in Scotland from 1107-

124, a strong and brave
ler who took greatly to
t~e game, and in between
his struggles to subdue his
enemies, engaged in it often
upon his native heath.

The history of hockey in
England is almost entirely obscured by time, and
is referred to in literature only at most infrequent
intervals. The most. interesting reference to it is
in Macauley’s “Essays on Bunyan,” in which he
remarks about Bunyan, that “bell-ringing and
playing hockey on Sundays seems to have been
the worst vices of this depraved tinker.” From
this we would infer that the game in England
had become considerably tamed since its earliest
days.

But in Scotland it continued to be almost as
- spirited as in the time of Alexander the Fierce,
and whole clans would play against each other.

It happened that late in the seventeen hundreds
it there was considerable feeling between the great

Campbell and McLean clans, because the Camp-
‘ bells approved of the House of Hanover being on
the throne of England, and the McLeans still
i sighed for the return of the Stuarts. So one day
I the Campbells challenged the McLeans to a Shinty,
I: or Hockey match, to decide whether the Hanovers
or the Stuarts were more fit to rule England.
.McLean ordered all of his men to appear without
fail, and a cousin of his, Mrs. Clephane, fired with
his enthusiasm, warned her tenants that if they
did not go to the game, she would raise their rent.
The consequence was that the McLean contingent
that appeared for the match was far larger than
the Campbell! From the customary beginning of
burying the ball in a hole in the sand, and then
struggling to find it, to the end of the game, the
play was wild and fierce. But wily McLean kept
some of his best men in reserve and sent them in
' from time to time to renew the fight against the
exhausted Campbells. Finally, the latter admitted
they could play no longer, and amid great rejoic-
ing from every McLean in the clan, “the Stuarts
" were acknowledged superior to the Hanoverians.

"The name 'hockey' cannot be claimed by
either the Scotch or the Irish' but is derived
from an old French word 'Hoquet.’ mean-

though it seems to have developed much
later there than it did across the Channel.
There is one exquisite relicI however. still
preserved. which proves that it was played
in France at least in the fifteenth century.
This is a unique old prayer book that be-
longed to the Dutchess of Burgundy. in
which there are several illustrations of
fifteenth century games. One depicts the
shepherds before the Nativity. playing
hockey to warm themselves."

It was about the middle
of the next century that
hockey began to come into
its own in England. Al-
though played in an unsci-
entific way, and varying in
rules in different localities,
it underwent an amazing
revival throughout the is-
land. By I870 many clubs
had been formed, and by
1875-76 uniform rules had
been made for all clubs.
But the real birthday of
modern hockey was 1886,
for in that year the first Hockey Association was
formed. Since then it has spread rapidly through
both England and America and is played en—
thusiastically as well in Belgium, Holland, Ger-
many, France, Denmark, Egypt, and India. The
last named country boasts as many as 3,000 teams.

As far as women’s hockey is concerned, the
first women’s club in England was formed in
1886, and it was introduced to the United States
at Bryn Mawr in 1901 by an English enthusiast,
Miss Constance Applebee. For some twenty years
there was little interest in the sport among the fair
sex of this country, but in 1921 an English
women’s team touring over here aroused great
enthusiasm that has never waned, and today
hockey is played in almost every girls’ school and
college in the country, and teams from the United
States frequently take, part in international
matches.

Ice Hockey

The latest and by far the most thrilling version
of hockey is played on ice. Probably the fastest
game ever played, it is of English origin, and was
carried to Canada early in this century by Lord
Stanley’s suite when he came to be Governor-
General of the Dominion. The Canadians took it
up with great gusto, and in seeking opponents
tried to start the sportsmen from the United
States playing. The Canadians, naturally, did not
object to the necessary freezing temperature, but
their neighbors to .the south most decidedly did.
This country could not become enthusiastic about
ice hockey until that great ice engineer, George C.
Flunk, started building rinks with artificial ice.
Now that the American public can keep its toes
warm, it watches ice hockey as one of its greatest

An Unusual Band ~

By GEORGE C. BERREMAN
Supervisor

WPA Adult Education and Recreation
Lane County. Oregon

ANE COUNTY, Oregon,
boasts a most unusual
band in its WPA pro-

gram. In it beginners sit be-
side master musicians, and
the ages of its members vary from nine to over
sixty years. The members represent a wide range
of occupations as well, for there are barbers,
farmers, clerks, teachers, architects, business men,
bank employees and students in the band, the
students ranging from the lifth grade to college.
The fact that live of the members once directed
bands makes the group even more out of the ordi-
nary. One of these men wears a gold medal
awarded him for winning a directing contest at
the VVorld’s Fair in Chicago. One directed circus
bands for years, and still another organized and
directed a band in one of the local lodges for over
ten years. These men take turns, with the director,
at the baton. '

It may seem that if beginners are to play side
by side with master musicians only very elemen-
tary selections can be used, yet our numbers have
included the following: . -

Overtures: William Tell (simplified edition)

Light C avalry

Three Blind Mice
Serenades: When Life is Brightest

Cupid’s Chorus

Circus: Chicken Roll
Bear Cat
Marches: Our Director

‘ Washington Gray

The problem of using beginners is met by hav-
ing experienced players sit beside them and coach
them in the difficult numbers. Beginners are also
asked to come early to practice, thus receiving
extra practice and help from the director, and
some inexperienced players take lessons at home
or at school. In beginning a new piece the less
skilled players sometimes sit watching and listen-

ing for a short time, thus training the ear and.

observing the technique to be attained.

Group morale and group solidarity are further
cemented by social activities. Often the members
of the band attend a movie together following the
concert or a rehearsal. Sometimes light refresh-

ments are served. Some little social feature is
planned each week.

Activities

Already an imposing number of activities are
being carried on. By April, 1937, boys and girls
might be found busily engaged, after school hours
and on Saturdays, in any of the following:

. Nature Study. The study of wild flowers, trees
and shrubs; collecting, pressing and classifying;
casting flowers and leaves in wax, and wild flower
painting trips are offered young botanists.

Those interest in geology may study rocks and
minerals, volcanoes, glaciers, erosion, soil, fossils
and earthquakes. They are shown methods of
collecting and classifying rocks
and minerals and are taken on
field trips.

Birds, insects and amphi-
bians are studied in the mu-
seum and in the field. Children
learn how to collect, classify
and mount insects. They go on
bird hikes.

Would-be gardeners are of-
fered garden architecture, gar—
dening, flower arrangement,
and ‘may study soil, plant
growth, flower books, the care

of house plants and the construction of miniature
and rock gardens. _,

Those who love the beach and shore can study
sea life in field trips and collect shells and other
marine forms, classifying them, mounting and
preserving them correctly.

Handcraft. Many a model hobbiest finds lead-
ers and tools to help him in his “work” at the
museum. Opportunities are provided for mak-
ing models of aeroplanes, gliders, boats (modern
and ancient), railroads and dwellings. The young
scientist, too, may use the workshop, making bird
houses, bird feeding stations and collecting equip—
ment such as insect nets and plant presses. The
geologist—or anyone else—may make relief maps
of some area he or she has explored.

Clubs. Some of‘ the activities are run on a club
basis. In April of this year a child might choose
from among the following clubs: Wildflower,
Bird Study, Butterfly, Biology, Geology, Model
Aeroplane, Model Ship, Model Railroad and
Model Stamp Club. '

Future Plans. As new material is added, more
activities will be offered to the playground di-
rectors and their groups. The museum hopes in
,the near future to add forestry, Indian lore, bas-
ket weaving, leathercrafti and art. '

A program will be arranged for nature study
walks and collecting trips to be conducted by a
member of the museum staff. This program will
consist of general
n a t u r e s t u d y
walks and bird
hikes ; wild iiower,
insect and rock-
collecting trips,
and trips to local
m u s e u m s a n d
zoos.

Children's Art
Gallery. It is pro-
posed that a cen-
tral space be pro-
vided for Cali-
fornia work, with
smaller gallery cu-
bicles for exhibits
of other countries
around the Pacific
and general Euro- -
pean and Eastern
American cities.

Recreation welcomes this opportunity to pub-
lish an article telling of emergency recre-
ation programs in institutions. The National
Recreation Association for a number of years
has promoted play in institutions and since ions impulses. Through
I930 has employed a special worker who has
given full time to helping institutions of vari-
ous types develop recreational programs. The
Association also maintains a bulletin service to
institutions and from time to time publishes
articles on some phase of the subiect. Increas-
1ife_ ingly local municipal recreation departments

enough to supply the medical
and physical needs of those
who are institutionalized. The
complete person must be serv-
ed. He must be assisted in his
adjustment to institutional life, and to life beyond
the institution walls. Institutions should not be
regarded as places in which to confine people from
whom society needs protection. Institutions should
properly be regarded as centers of rehabilitation
with an ultimate return to normal society as the
objective.

“By providing recreation leaders to public in-
stitutions, it is hoped that the general public will
respond sufficiently to permit the inclusion of
these activities as a necessary and permanent part
of institutional responsibility.”

There has been little chance heretofore for labo—
ratory analysis of a recreation program in action
in institutions. Methods and procedures were of
necessity experimental at first. Close cooperation
with experts in criminology and mental therapy in
basic research and observation of WPA programs
has led to worthwhile discoveries. Some recogni-
tion has been given by members of the professions
who have watched these experiments with interest.

Puppetry in Psychiatric Wards

The best known and most outstanding develop—
ment has been the production of puppet plays in
the psychiatric ward for children of Bellevue
Hospital, New York City.* The emotionally-dis—
turbed youngsters, obsessed with hatred of parents I
and all forms of discipline
and order, have identified
themselves with the pup—
pet characters and found
harmless release for vic-

their spontaneous re
sponses they direct the ac-
tion of the play. These un-
conscious comments and

those made later when the children in a group dis-
cuss the play have given psychiatrists an insight
into the character of their disturbances. Case his-
tories of each child’s reaction, made by nurses and
doctors, are used to plan hospital and post-hos—
pital treatment.

The main character in the majority of the plays
is Casper, a German folk character similar to the
English Punch. “He is eager, searching, curious,
freely expressing his wants; active, responding to
his inner needs, without feelings of guilt or
anxiety; only wanting what he wants and de-
termined to get it; he is aggressive if necessary,
he is bound to succeed and he cannot be hurt, and
after each adventure he is always ready for the
next one; he is reasonably brave, but does not
hesitate to run away when it is advisable; and he
has a strong sense of his own superiority and no
feelings of inferiority because there is always help
at hand when he is too weak for any situation.
In other words, Casper represents all that the
child would like to be himself.” Other characters
—Charlie the monkey, the policeman, the alligator
—represent familiar friends or enemies, particu—
larly parents.

At crucial points in the stories, the audience
directs Casper’s actions in no uncertain terms. In
answer to his question, “What shall we do about
schools?” comes the roaring response,“Burn ’em !”

“What about mothers and fathers P”

“Kill ’em !”

But this time there are dissenting voices, “Let
my mother alone.” Sometimes fights break out
immediately between the two factions. Casper ca-
joles. He asks how they would like to be killed,
how they would feel if they no longer had moth-
ers. In time the group agrees with the original
dissenters.

The children themselves make the puppets,
which helps them to see the humor and unreality
in Casper being attacked by the bad alligator. The
puppeteer, whom the children know as Uncle Cas-
per, works very closely with them. Because of his
identification with Casper the puppet, they find it
much easier to talk intimately with him than with
nurses or doctors. Information he gains in this
informal way is most useful to the psychiatrist.

Recreation in Prisons

\Naupun, Wisconsin, was faced with a difficulty
common to most institutions. Because of the pre—
determined schedule of the prison, he had only a

RECREATION REHABILITATES THE SHUT-IN 419

A youthful patient in St. Luke's Hospital, * 

Riverside. California. drawing pictures to
illustrate stories told him by a WPA worker,

singing games soon solved the problem to
'lhe benefit of the children as well as the
hospital attendants. Mothers took an in-
terest and went home with information
about stories and games which might be
taught their own children. A similar prob-
lem was solved by the same method in a
Detroit Children’s Clinic waiting room.

It has been found that music is very
soothing to the insane. The State Hospital
in Pontiac, Michigan, although skeptical
of the outcome, allowed the WPA to set
up a music project as an experiment within
the hospital. It has turned out so success-
fully that the officials of the hOSpital are
considering giving the project director permanent
employment. It is a particularly impressive per-
formance, the inmates singing, perhaps a little too
lustily, in the chapel, accompanied by one of their
number. An orchestra also has been formed in
the hospital to play at concerts and small affairs,
and especially at meal time. Although capable of
carrying on a conversation, the inmates do not talk
very much at dinner. Music fills the gap.

At Mendota State Hospital, Mendota, Wiscon-
sin, social dancing has been added to the music
program for the insane. The patients enjoy their
dances, hardly able to wait from one number to
the next. They conduct themselves in a surpris-
ingly civilized and well mannered fashion. All
are given individual attention.

The Physically Handicapped

Their physical handicaps need no longer cut off
the crippled, the blind and the disabled from nor-
mal existence. No matter how limited the patient’s
abilities, they can often be expanded. Now the
"blind tap dance so well that on occasion they have
been requested to provide an evening’s entertain-
ment, the crippled wrestle, and those with speech
disorders debate. To accomplish these results,
recreation leaders in institutions were forced to
discover new methods of instruction.

In New York City the recreation program for
the blind is as complete as any other program in
the city. It includes swimming and bowling,
forums, public speaking, games, dancing, dra-

 

matics, and music. Game room activities for chil-—
dren seek to develop the sense of hearing to re-
place in some degree their lost sight. Rolling a
ball toward the person calling for it helps the
blind child recognize the voice of the person
speaking and estimate direction and distance from
the sound. Added difficulties in teaching dancing
are met when the participant is deaf and dumb as
well as blind. Recreation leaders cooperating with
the community workers for the blind have used a
simplified code by which they tap out instructions
in the palm of the participant’s hand.

A program of physical activities, social danc-
ing and simple dramatics is carried on in the Insti-
tute for the Crippled and Disabled in New York
City. All patients, some wearing artificial limbs
and carrying crutches, participate in at least a part
of the program. Normal play with other mem-
bers of the group helps to eliminate self-conscious-
ness as well as provide necessary exercise. Mus~
cular control is restored to many in the therapeue
tic pool, with swimming instructors assisting. Re-
habilitation is carried as far as possible by close
cooperation with the employment service of the
crippled and disabled. Rhythm and motion in
music, dramatics and games tend to ease the body
strain and tension which are the base for many
speech disorders. These activities form only a
part of the full recreation program established
by WPA in the National Hospital for Speech Dis-
orders, New York City.

Convalescents at Play

The convalescent child is a problem all to him-
self, not so much to the physician as to the nurses.
Sometimes, petulant with illness or restless with
returning health, he tries various toys,tiring almost
immediately. And here it is wise to remember
that such petulance, such restlessness, would have
to be met by busy nurses if the recreation'workl
ers were not available. Nurses think in terms of
the very sick. A convalescing patient must be left
to himself more or less. This the child patient're-
sents. He has had attention, perhaps too much,
from parents at home. _His ego is hurt when a
sicker child in the ward demands the nurse’s at—
tention, and he begins to marshal his needs and
his demands. If ignored, he becomes fretful, more
conscious of his physical condition, retarded in his
convalescence, and a real problem to nurses.

In the Children’s Hospital in Detroit there are
four recreation leaders who are. greeted by con-
valescent children with a friendly, “Hi, teacher!”
as they make their daily rounds with three—tiered
carts. Out of the carts come toys, games, sketch
pads, crayolas, paper and paste, rubber balls and
dolls. Attention is given to making special toys
adaptable to the convalescing child.- Paints, clay
and similar materials are omitted because they are
unsuitableito use in bed. The child is occupied,
and at the same time creative. Often the desire
to draw or build is awakened not by direct in-
struction but by bedside story-telling. Soon the
child himself, instead of the leader, is drawing the
illustrations for the stories. An attempt is made
to bring even the most isolated child.into this
group activity. ‘

“An occupied child is a child who gets well
quicker,” says Miss Roger, Superintendent. "‘He
will not dwell upon his sickness, upon symptoms,
etc., as will an adult, and if kept busy will have a
healthy mental attitude toward his experience.”

Tuberculosis Sufferers Benelited

In the tuberculosis wards particularly, recrea-
' tion does more than merely occupy the child. At
M etr0politan Hospital, New York City, the usual
story-telling hour is built around the theme of food.
This helps to stimulate lagging appetites, one of
the symptoms of tubercular children. At the same
time, politeness, neatness, personal hygiene, gen-
erosity and other good habits can be instilled into
the children by givingithese traits to the likeable
characters in the stories. The program gives at-
tention, too, to singing games which do not tire

the children. But the illusion of motion in th
action songs makes them a satisfactory emot
and energy release.

Biblio-Therapy

Book service has been provided for patient
all types of institutions. The service is expa
to personal interviews to determine reading a
erences. The distribution of books has been
related with other activities, particularly dis
sion ‘groups, which are conducted even for
children. One more tie is thus established
tween the group inside and the world ou
through reading and discussion. It is intere
to note that a New York doctor has applied
title of “Biblio-Therapy” to this program.

The Art of Pitching Horseshoes

Rome and Greece were world
, powers, the soldiers found
exercise and Sport in throwing
t. discus. The camp followers could not indulge

i such contests because they lacked both the

ney to buy a discus or the means to manu-

f ture one. However, when horseshoes were in-

v ted to protect the hoofs of animals traveling

0 er mountains or through rock-strewn passes,

t followers picked up the discarded shoes, and
fashioned them into discus form.

At first they merely tossed the closed horse-
shoes through the air aiming only for distance.

' These people soon tired of this form of play be-
cause tossing the light imitations of a heavy dis—
cus was not highly entertaining. Seeking for some
game where quoit throwing could be made truly
competitive they settled upon the quoit pitching
game of today by pitching at a stake.‘ The discus
orl quoit nearest the stake counted a point.

Years later these people grew tired of bending
a horseshoe into a circle so they merely tossed the
shoes as they were found. This was the beginning
of horseshoe pitching which in modern times has
cpme into p0pularity with tremendous strides
while quoit pitchi_ng, so far as the United States
is concerned. is almost a lost art.

The pitching of quoits and horseshoes, started
by the nondescripts and derelicts who trailed the
ancient armies, found great favor among the
soldiers and quickly became a sport among Gre-

cian and Roman royalty, nobility and aristocracy.

. The crowned heads of Europe played one or both
games all through the centuries.’ England boasted

' of having the greatest quoit and horseshoe pitch-

' ers in the 17th, 18th_and 19th centuries.

The game of horseshoes was played under hap-
hazard rules until 1869 when the English drew up
the first set of rules and regu-
lations. The same rules applied
to both horseshoes and quoits.
Later these were changed, the
two games were separated and

. a different set of rules was

drafted for Each.

not known. However, the game
was extremely popular among
soldiers of both armies during
the Revolutionary War.
Whether the game was played in the United
States prior to that time or was taught to Ameri-
cans by captured British troops is unknown.

The first actual horseshoe pitching club in this
country was known as the Tourists Club and was
formed in Long Beach, California, in 1900. Horse-
shoe pitchers from all parts of the United States
and Canada enrolled in this club. This was fol-
lowed by the creation of similar organizations
throughout the country.

In 1909, the little town of Bronson, Kansas, an-
nounced the first international horseshoe pitching
contest, declaring, “this tournament is Open to the
world.” Frank Jackson, an Iowa farmer, was the
winner of this contest. This tournament led to
others elsewhere and the outcome was the crea-
tion in 1915 of the National Horseshoe Pitchers
Association of America, which, until 1929, was in
complete control of the sport and conducted
tournaments in the south during the winter and
usually in the middle west during the summer
months. This association is now a professional.
organization.

An amateur organization called the American
Horseshoe Pitchers Association was formed in
1929, with headquarters in Chicago. It enlisted
the aid of newspapers throughout the United
States to arrange a nation-wide amateur cham-
pionship tournament. These newspapers con--
ducted horseshoe pitching contests in their own
territories in 1930. The winners of the local tour-
naments participated in the national tournament
in Chicago in September 1930.

How to Pitch Horseshoes

ochial horseshoe court is pre-

sented in Figure I. A typical

official horseshoe, showing its

blade and toe and heel calks is
. illustrated in Figure II.

The one and three-quarter
and the one and one-quarter
turns have proven to be the
best turns to use in pitching
the shoe.

The One and Three-
Quarter Turn. When
using this turn, the shoe
revolves one and three-
quarter times as it
passes through the air
from the hand of the
pitcher to the stake. A
diagram of the turn is
shown in Figure III.

If correctly thrown, the heel calks of the shoe
should first touch the clay surrounding the stake
and the open section should be pointed toward the

stake.

In throwing the one

firmly grasp the shoe in
such a way that the

HE COLLECTING and studying of stamps is an
educational-recreational activity well deserv-
ing of a place on a well-rounded recreation
rogram. The cultivation of this hobby as a
rorthwhile leisure time activity is highly desir-
" , embracing as it does history, art, geography,
V'lCS, printing, design, financial valuations, con-
titration, research and social contacts—a com-
irkrtion probably unequalled by any other form
‘ -recreation.
I, ,Curiously enough, while there is scarcely a
wn or city in the country without stamp clubs
l d stamp collectors, as a part of the recreation
rigram this activity has been all too often over-
} ed. In fact, this fertile field is, officially,
gnored entirely in many municipalities Where
ilhilately flourishes among children and adults.
'I Some of the values of this hobby are to be
und in the fact that it sets no age limits; that

has not only a permanent value to the indi-
idual but a constantly increasing one; that it is
0t new but has been passed on from generation

lasses, the poor as well as the rich, the slow-
Jitted as well as the brilliantly intellectual.

Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance center of

lncle Sam daily delivers a tremendous volume of
nail, is a city that for years paid little attention

laces harbor more stamp clubs and philately no-
rhere enjoys more widespread popularity. It was

visor of Recreation James H.Dillon and his WPA-
Recreation Division to enlarge the indoor program
for the community centers that stamp clubs were
organized as a supervised recreation project.

There has never been an activity in Hartford
greeted with such instantaneous success and ap-
proval. Boys and girls and adults flocked to the
clubs, parents dug into trunks and attics for col- -
lections, many of them valuable, that were started
years ago, and young men who previously shun-
ned recreation centers began to attend and gradu-
ally extended their interest to other features of
the program.

Realizing that expert guidance and instruction
was a prime requisite for the success of the clubs,
Mr. Dillon launched his plan by obtaining the
services of Joseph S. Miller, an outstanding au-
thority who has devoted a lifetime to the study
of stamps and who had the added advantages of
years of experience as a teacher.

Mr. Miller is a firm believer in the importance
of philately for children and as a vital force in
educational recreation. “I believe,” he says,“that in
addition to the training in cleanliness in the pro-
per handling of stamps and the neatness of their
arrangement in albums, the knowledge gleaned
of history, art, geography and civics tends to make
the child more alert and emphasizes in the eyes of
children the constantly changing, wonders of civi—
lization in the past and the present.”

As a beginning, Mr. Miller organized ten
groups of girls and boys in ten different com-
munity centers into stamp clubs. He met with

423

424 STAMPS AND RECREATION

these groups at least once a week. Only girls and
boys were accepted who displayed a genuine in-
terest in stamps. Mr. Miller supervised each
meeting and divided the members into age groups,
the younger ones meeting afternoons from 3.30
to 5.30 o’clock and the older ones in the evenings
from 6.30 until 8.30 o’clock. In order that each
club might function smoothly and properly, sim-
ple constitutions and by-laws were adopted and
definite programs put into effect. Officers were
elected for a term of three months, and many
children were found with a considerable knowl—
edge of parliamentary procedure, thanks to their
affiliations with school clubs.

At the Club Meetings

Each meeting comprises two distinct sections,
one the business and educational, the other the
trading period. At the educational session Mr.
Miller tells stamp stories of all countries, illus-
trating them with displays of actual stamps from
his extensive collections, and keeping the mem-
bers informed on current trends in philately. For
example, if a new stamp is announced, he de-
scribes its historical signihcance, its design, color,
peculiarities and perforations, and even arranges
for the students to obtain covers from cities of
first day issue.

When this part of the program is over the
trading (and excitement) begins. Each member
has an album and a box of duplicates for ex-
change. When a youngster finds a stamp he de-
sires in another’s collection, to obtain it he must
permit the other to rummage through his collec-
tion to find a stamp or stamps of equivalent value
or desirability. Such procedure adds zest and
friendly rivalry to the meetings.

Parents display almost as much interest in
stamps and the clubs as children. Many attend
the meetings with their children and help with
advice and encouragement. Several have passed
on to children collections of value, including one
that has a rarity that would command several
thousand dollars in the philately market.

From the outset the collecting of stamps as a
financial exchange was not encouraged for it is
liable to detract from the educational value of the
study. In the clubs-the children are prohibited
from buying or selling for cash, and every trans-
action must be on the basis of trading. ‘ The
financial phase, however, is never absent from
Mr. Miller’s mind for, underlying all his plans,
is the hope that in years to come the collections

now in the process of accumulation will hav
sufhcient monetary value so their cash equival l
will pay, in whole or in part, for a college edu
tion for the young collector. '

“I have seen this work out many times and i,

asserts. “Many children start collecting w 
they are seven or eight years old. Parents 5

can be converted into enough cash to pay for
or more years tuition.”

In the stamp classes Mr. Miller devotes 1
ticu—lar attention to the less fortunate type of c I
dren whose parents cannot afford an outlay '
money either for stamps, albums or outfits. In 1.
efforts to provide equal benefits for all memb 
regardless of race, creed or financial standing, ‘ é,
Miller has required children whose affluent a
ents went to extremes to encourage their c :
dren’s interest, to give up expensive albums . ,5
costly purchases. In their place, he insists t :7
acquire and use cheaper books more in kee ‘1
with the other children in the class. The alb -
of course, is the beginning of the collection, .
an ordinary ten cent variety is preferred beca
its cost is within the reach of practically ev
child and because it keeps all the young collect
on the same level.

Mr. Miller helps the youngsters acquire t
hrst stamps, restricting their early efforts ex :
sively to United States issues. He himself don 3
and distributes hundreds of specimens from
own collection. His usual procedure is to prep
a pailful of unsorted, mixed stamps and per
each child to help himself to a handful. He t
supervises the drying, sorting, identification .
posting of each stamp.

“It is encouraging,” Mr. Miller says, “to
how the children of better hnancial status
their less fortunate club members acquire a t
lection. They are very generous and often go
of their way to cooperate, giving freely of tl
own stamps from duplicate stocks and trad
books.” i

The history of every stamp is studied, b
from a philatelic and historical standpoint,
ticular attention being paid to the period,
geography, the purpose, the person or place

printing and paper. When the new Army .

ent frOm the playful hiss-the-villain parties which have
suddenly come into vogue among enlightened theater-
goers. It was evident from the first that these wide-
eyed, serious men and women, boys and girls in the
audience were emotionally moved by the fair-haired, in-
nocent Eva and the wicked, brutal slave dealers of New

Orleans.

of those who appear on the “boards in ‘The Drunkard,’
where a beer-drinking group jeers the villain and ap—
plauds virtue more as a game than because the play really
carries emotional appeal.”

The constant outpouring of thousands of people
from tenements and apartment houses, and the, in-

creasing weekly and yearly attendance, prove that
the people, once introduced to the magic of the
living stage, find in it a vital and appealing med-
ium of entertainment.

Letters which came in the hundreds to the pro j-
ect expressed the gratitude of men, women and
children—sometimes humbly—for the theater en-
tertainment the government gave them without
charge. "

The Federal Theater, on the whole, has
paced its productions well. Audiences '
had developed to a point during the sec-
ond year where it was considered prudent
to introduce on the trucks Shakespeare’s
“The Comedy of Errors,” “The Em-
peror’s New Clothes,” “Broken Dishes,”
along with “Love ’Em and Leave ’Em,”
“Adam and Eva” and others of a similar
type. This season shows the most re-
markable advance in theater fare. On a
tour this writer made she was delighted"
to find Paul Vulpius’ “Help Yourself,”
Sinclair Lewis’ “It Can’t Happen Here,”
Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Iolanthe” and a
revival of “The Emperor’s New Clothes.”

Altogether twenty productions, cover-
ing a wide range of audience appeal, were
readied by the Caravan unit for its trucks
this summer. Other plays which we did
not have an opportunity to witness in-
clude: “Pierre Patelin,” “Jack and the
Beanstalk,” “Pirates of Penzance” and
“Show Off.”

in the

- OR THE PAST two decades directors
I F of physical education and ,recrea-
, tion have increasingly emphasized

the “carry-over” values to be found in
i public school and college programs of physical
education. In other words, is it more valuable
fer a boy to spend his time in becoming a skilled
hurdle racer or a proficient swimmer? Will he be
a hurdle racer between the ages of' twenty—five
and sixty years, or will he be more likely to swim
for health and pleasure? Would he be likely to
use his skill as a hurdler more than his knowledge
or ability as a swimmer, in contact with his family
and friends as he seeks recreation and healthful
enjoyment?

The answer is obviOUSly in favor of such ac-
tivities as swimming. Swimming and the less
specialized and less competitive sports have a far
greater carry-over value than javelin throwing,
5 0t putting, mile running and similar sports, such
football, baseball and basketball. These sports
e a place in the program but they do not have
carry-over value. A man who, as an active
dent, has been trained even moderately in ten-
, swimming, golf, badminton, volleyball, horse—
5, croquet, paddle tennis, archery, shufHe-
d, gymastics and similar activities, is conceded
ave a far greater opportunity for later enjoy-

father will not neglect to provide sport activity
for his family. He will equip his own backyard
so that it will provide wholesome fun in various
seasons. The backyard playground movement, as
promoted by the National Recreation Association
through many city recreation departments, is the
result of an evident need for putting into use the
sport knowledge gained in earlier years. Much
progress has been made because of the growing
sense, on the part of parents, of their responsi-
bility to their children for planning for the mutual
enjoyment to be found in family participation in
body—building, socializing, sports activities.

It is at this point that parents will fmd use for
carry—over activities. The whole family responds
when dad shows a keen participating interest in
almost any activity. Children know dad is a hero,
and glory in seeing him do things. Fortunate in—
deed is the man who has been trained in the skills
which are'most usable for such a home program!
Simple activities take on importance under such
guidance and interest._ Croquet, for example, a
game which the modern athlete might not wish to
be seen playing, is nevertheless a game! There is
opportunity for sportsmanship, consideration for
opponents and fair play to be taught and learned
in such a simple game. Dad may have been on the
college teams, and though he has taken on forty
extra pounds around the region of his belt, the
same timing, judgment of distance, consideration
of space and spin of the ball, and strategy can be
employed 'in the simple game of croquet. In table
tennis, a game now highly developed with national
championships, will be discovered an unbeliev-
ably interesting activity calling for all degrees of
ability, making it suitable for young or old. Vol—
ley ball and badminton require much accuracy,

speed, distance and position. The man who may

have. played left field or received punts on college

teams can find ample opportunity to use his knowl-

edge in teaching the whole family the same tech-
nique in these simple backyard games, as well as
can an expert tennis player.

We hear parent education greatly stressed in
Parent-Teacher Associations and similar groups
in an effort to create a new feeling of parental
respOnsibility for the proper program within “the
family. It is an embarrassing fact that many
American parents have more or less unconsciously
turned their children over to the many boy and
girl organizations and to the public schools. To
some this is a logical development; others are not
willing to surrender to any organization ‘the most
important and vital privilege of being a real
mother or dad. It is a proud boy or girl who can
look forward to regular fun with dad and mother.
The joyous anticipation of the_ week-end outing
and sports with them will go far to buck up the
lagging energy of the adolescent boy or girl. 'The
confidence and understanding between parent and
child, so vital for proper guidance in habit form-
ing years, is naturally and surely established
through the comradeship built up in sport ac-
tivity interest. Such relationship is difficult to get
if the “crowd” which makes up our vast multi-
tude afflicted with spectatoritis, is followed. A
hundred families participating separately in home
recreation are of more value than ten. hundred in
grandstand seats watch-
ing modern gladiators on
the athletic field. The
sharp disagreement
found today concerning
over-emphasis in college
athletics has to do with
the carry-over in adult
life that can be made of
the skill thus learned.

Where could a more
delightful setting for '
family recreation be
found than that provid-
ed by NationaLParks?

Our model airplane program in
troit began simply enough with
organization in 1926 of a
b of forty boys in one of the
reation centers. At the end of
t second month boys were com-
i from eight to ten miles to attend the weekly
l etings. By Christmas of that year the enroll-
‘ ntnt had passed the hundred ' mark and sev-
e 1 other clubs had been started. Since then the
n mber of participants has increased rapidly.
enty—two clubs now meet each week enrolling
r fifteen hundred boys who build on an aver-
of five hundred planes a week. The staff has
n increased by four WPA workers. The Model
craft Division of the Recreation Department
upies several large offices and work rooms in
main building of the Recreation Department
has a small exPerimental laboratory where a
uid chemical called microfilm is made which,
en applied to the surface of the water, forms a
nsparent film that is then applied to the frame-
k of the plane instead of paper because of its
tness.

Membership

When a boy wishes to become
a member of a Recreation Air-
craft Club he must obtain an ap-
plication blank to be signed by
his parents. The signature is re-
quired in order to bring the par-
ents closer to their sons’ recrea-
tional activities and to give them
a clearer idea of our program.
Upon return of this card the boy pays a fee of
twenty-five cent as dues for the year. This
money is used in providing membership pins, an-'
nual trophies and prizes for each city champion-

ship contest. The boy is then ready to start his
model aircraft career.

Listed on our roster are boys of ten years, many
high school boys studying aero courses, and col-
lege men registered in the school of aeronautical
engineering. We also have a special group of
adults who use model aircraft as their hobby.

Winning a Membership Pin

The first plane the boy builds must be a R.O.G.
(Rise Off Ground.) This plane has a stick fuse-
lage and a detachable wing. He learns in making
it something of primary aerodynamics, for the
same principles that cause this small plane to rise
and fly cause all planes to begin and SUStain flight.
After a few weeks of this R.O.G. construction
and the theory of flight, the boy is given a test in
which his plane is required to fly fifteen seconds
from a ground start and thirty seconds from a
hand launching. The boy must be able to answer
and give reasons for those answers for the con-
trol of flight and know the names of fifteen parts
of an aeroplane. When this test is successfully
passed the boy receives a membership pin.

Earning the rAviator’s Pin
After showing an elementary knowledge of air-
craft, a second step is taken to obtain an Aviator’s
Pin, for which the following tests must be passed:
I. Indoor endurance model; 20 to 40 inch frame;
flight two minutes.

429

430 MODEL AIRPLANE CLUBS IN DETROIT

2. Outdoor endurance model ; 20 to 40 inch frame;
flight two minutes.

3. Commercial model; enclosed fuselage; adjust-
able wings; flight 30 seconds.

4. Miniature model—similar in appearance to a
real plane, but need not be of any spec1f1c make.
It must have hollow wings, cambered surfaces
fully covered by double surfaces on the wing
areas. All controls must be movable.

5. Hydroplane—any size; must sustain its weight
on water; taxi take-off and land.

6. Biplane—stick model; 6 t0 8 inch fuselage.
Flight two minutes.

Standard ROG—flight one minute.

Glider-—-c0rrect detailed construction; smooth
even glide.
This group of tests usually requires about one

and a half years to complete. Since a broad field
of model aircraft and theory of flight is proven
in the requirements, the Aviator Pin is eagerly

sought

.mx

The Ace Test

The next advancement requires a rounded
knowledge of all phases of aircraft flight and con-
struction and is rarely qualified for by .anyone
having less than six years of model-building ex-
perience. The standards are set high and the boy
passing the Ace Test can justly be proud of his
accomplishments. The test is as follows:

I. A historical thesis of not less than one thou—
sand words on the progress of aircraft through-
out ‘the world and the achievements of aero-
nautical engineers in giving the public our
modern planes and equipment.

2. Indobr flight with a plane of his own design;
flight six minutes.

3. Outdoor flight with a plane of his own design;
flight six minutes. ,

These tests cannot be passedaduring a contest
and all planes must be rubber-powered and rise
off the ground by taxiing on revolving wheels.

Cooperating Organizations

Our Department has been greatly pleased with
the cooperation of the other City Departments.
The Board of Education permits our clubs to
meet in school auditoriums and gymnasiums after

. Some Adventures
in W
Nature

Recreation

NDER THE GUIDANCE of two nature specialists

‘  the children on the playgrounds in West-

chester County, New York, are finding op-

portunities for exciting adventures in nature study.

A quick trip to some of the communities in the

county will reveal the varied activities of this
nature program.

" In Peekskill there is a nature walk every day;
. children with talents in arts and crafts are en-
couraged to paint or draw nature motives; inter-
! pretive dancing based on a nature theme has been
stressed this past summer, and each child has con-
tributed a page of his own findings to the group
scrapbook. The children have QUght turtles,
snakes, toads, frogs and lizards for study and
I gathered leaves, flowers and insects for collections.
Rye boasts a nature club and a volunteer speak-
er’s bureau which provides authorities on nature
subjects each week. Children are stimulated to
F extensive work in nature through the awarding of

 

points in nature study. For instance, a child who
collects fifty Japanese beetles or ten different
leaves, or who makes or identifies the calls of ten
birds, receives an award of ten points for nature
study.

' Other communities served by the specialists re-
port leaf identification, tree maps showing the dif-
ferent trees on the playground, construction of
nature trails and the making of scrap books. The
facilities of the Museum of Science and Arts in
Yonkers have been made available to the play-

ground children in that community for the study __

l of stones, minerals and trees. Eleven playgrounds
in New Rochelle send children interested in nature
to the Huguenot Museum.

H

At Mamaroneck, on the other hand, nearness to
the beach has resulted in great interest in collec—
tions of shells and crabs. In Eastchester there is

i
l
3 a tree club, in Hastings, a Junior Garden Club.

Four special trips, called “nature treasure hunts”
were organized by the nature specialists during
the past summer—one to the Blue Mountain Res—
ervation to study all forms of nature; one to
Poundridge Reservation for nature trails; a third
to Bear Mountain, to visit the trail-side museum,
and the fourth to Manursing Island Park for an
early morning bird walk.

Suggestions to play leaders interested in de-
veloping a nature work-shop in their local com-
munities are offered on one of the specialist’s re-
ports. The projects outlined by her, which may
easily be adapted or developed by any community,
are as follows:

I. Plan and lay out a nature trail.

2. Make a nature scrapbook for the playground
as well as individual scrapbooks.

3. Make a collection of “nature findings,” i.e.,
flowers, leaves, insects and stones, for exhi-
bition purposes.

4. Keep a nature corner when an indoor room
IS available.

5. Make an illustrated report on one of the fol-
following topics, showing how playground
members can aid in the control of these de-
structive forces:

(a) Japanese beetle
(1)) Elm tree beetle

(6) Teht caterpillar
(d) Forest destruction (nres, etc.)
6. Make an outdoor garden Where pOSSible on

the playground—~or window-box or dish gar-
dens where no other space is available.

7. Form a nature club to interest other children

in the playgrOunds.

Essex County, New Jersey, through its County
Park Commission provides a nature ranger who
last summer visited the playgrounds and made it
possible for children to enjoy nature exploration
and adventure in the parks and who also con-

ducted visitors from various municipalities through
the Reservation.

Recreation departments which were unable to
arrange picnics and nature walks in South Moun-
tain or Eagle Rock selected a park near their own
grounds for the trips and a ranger was sent to
them.

Eleven bus loads of children, representing those
of the Essex County park system playgrounds
where interest in nature activities \‘vas greatest
and where the park itself afforded the fewest op-
portunities for exploration, were taken to South
Mountain or Grover Cleveland for a day’s picnic
which included a nature walk and an opportunity
to cobk a meal at an open fireplace.

The nature ranger has proved a desirable addi-
tion to the recreation staff, and present plans pro-
vide for the continuation of his work as an in-
tegral part of the program next year.

State park authorities are in increasing num-
bers providing nature guides to add interest to the
opportunities offered in the parks. 'In the state
parks of Oklahoma, for example, a series of Sun—
day nature study tours has been initiated, with
geologists and wildlife specialists serving as
guides. The first trip held was attended by more
than 500 people. In planning for the tours pub-
licity was launched on a state-wide basis six weeks
in advance, with stories distributed for Sunday
release on each of the following weeks. The ini-
tial annOuncement included a solid page of pic-
tures in one of the State’s largest papers.

Those conducting the trips visit the respective
parks several days in advance of the tours to map
out the routes. At ten o’clock in the morning the.
hikers meet at the park
where they are met at
the entranCe by CCC
enrollees who distribute
mimeographed pro-
grams and give direc-
tions for reaching the
point of. assembly where
the cars are to be park-
ed. The enrollees make
a court of the arrivals.
When the visitors leave
the park they are asked
by the CCC members
what facilities they en-
joyed most and what
additional opportunities
they would like to see

er of Klamath Falls,
regon, Tommy was
aded for the reform
hool. He had a long
t of petty crimes to
credit, and his par—
' e‘ts could do nothing
, with him.
‘ Sergeant Cook de-
‘ cided to get acquainted
with the boy. Going to
him he'greeted him with
the “ G o o (1 morning,

sergeant’s charac-
istic way of getting
cquainted.

The boy’s face lit up. “Sure, I’d just as leave

had no time for petty crimes.

That boy is only one of a long list. But today
juvenile delinquency is decidedly on the decrease
because Sergeant Cook took a guiding had in the
rlcreation of the children. He made friends with
them, took them on hikes, rides and picnics, played
I mes, baseball and marbles. He wanted to know

That was the beginning. Soon Tommy was a °

Recreation with a Purpose

he had a full—time job, but in his
own spare time, starting with ab-
solutely nothing, he has one of the
best organized recrea-
tion programs in Ore—
gon. And this year a
paid recreation director
was added to the pro-
gram.

First, the Boys’ Patrol

Sergeant Cook began
with the Boys’ Patrol.
He visited the schools
and talked traffic rules .
to the boys. Standing
before them he explain-
ed how accidents hap-
pen to school children
every year because some
children do not under-
stand or obey traffic
rules. He told of the need of
traffic officers right in that
school. How would they like to be those officers?
They would.

So the boys were organized in each of the
seven city schools under the name of Boys’ Pa—
trol. Each boy in turn served as a traffic officer.
Only the boys above the fourth grade were in—.
cluded and about eight boys were on duty each
day, so all whose grades were a certain standard
and citizenship was satisfactory had a turn at
wearing the white web belt and had the respon—
sibility and importance of directing the traffic of
their schoolmates.

No child was permitted to jay-walk. Sergeant
Cook proudly tells of the time one of his patrol
boys challenged him for cutting a corner. The
man promptly admitted his guilt and promised to
report for punishment.

The patrol officer assisted the first'graders at
crossings and taught them to be ever watchful of
cars. He had to be courteous and prompt in his
duties.

This year Sergeant Cook talked to his patrols
about the ever-present danger of bicycles in traffic.
How would they like to learn the rules governing
cars, take a written examination on those rules

433

434 RECREATION LVITH A PURPOSE

as well as a rider’s test, and have a bicycle license
which would cost them twenty-five cents? Again
they would. The girls and boys owning bicycles
would all do this. My own small son began sav-
ing his money at once and never was without
twenty-five cents until the time came for the ex-
amination, for which he studied and passed a
higher test than his parents ever had. And the
pride in that small oblong license, an exact dupli-
cate of the Oregon plate! Every other year a new
one will be issued at the same price.

If every grown-up took as much pride in care-
ful driving and knowledge and observance of traf—
fice rules as these yougsters, the danger of acci-
dents would be greatly lessened.

Recreational Activities Organized

When summer came that first year, Sergeant
Cook wanted to keep the boys and girls busy. So
he organized clubs—'—baseball, softball, bicycle, and
there was swimming for everybody twice a week.
Money was scarce but he went again and again
to the service clubs, who never refused to help.

Then when summer days grew hot, the sergeant
made up his mind to take these boys on a vacation
camp which would mean a week away from hot
dry pavements in the' cool of the nearby moun-
tains. So back he went to the service clubs, re-
turning with enOUgh money and volunteer help
for a‘camp and necessary equipment and a cook.
Transportation for the twenty mile ride was fur-
nished by interested truck owners. Each boy fur—
nished his own blankets, enough food for a week
(about two and a half dollars’ worth), a plate,
knife and fork and his own toilet articles.

At last all was ready, and every kit was checked

as to the proper equipment. Carrying their bed- _

ding roll and groceries they poured into the trucks,
sixty of them, the older boys assisting the little
fellows.

One week to swim and play and fish or just
loaf! Aside from certain duties such as making
their own beds and helping in the kitchen in turn
the boys could choose that which they wished to
do. Most of the boys had never slept out under
the stars on a bed made of fir boughs. Out here in
the West where to go camping
is one of the easiest things to
do, with mountains and streams
on every side, these underprivi- ful
ledged children had never camp-
ed. Sergeant Cook tells of one
little red headed fellow who in

a volunteer in this very success-
venture, writes:

rector and his assistants using your

the wee small hours crept quietly in beside hi
cold and frightened, cuddled down in his ar
and fell asleep.

At the end of the week the boys returned .
tell of pine cone fights, of fishing and hiking, a
of good fellowship.

And Now!

Those were the early days. Now there is
grown-up business air to it all. There are th
playgrounds with equipment, made possible
liberal donations.

I had been one of many who had given seve
hours each week to help keep the children bu
and we had been hard put for materials. But t
delight in visiting the classes now! Here is

every kind of work, the sixty-year-old stud
the most enthusiastic of all. They are working
charcoal, crayon, pencil, water color and oil. Ov
it all is an atmosphere of good cheer, and I he
excited talk of picnics and hikes.

Sergeant Cook has not accomplished nearly .
he has set out to. He wants a swimming tank a
a club house and we know these will come.

the important steps Oregon cities have taken

Municipal Organization in Junior Club Work

UNIOR CLUBS may be
defined briefly as
1 small groups of from
sight to twenty boys be-
ween the ages of eleven
and fifteen, who seek
rbup life because of common social
|nd athletic interests. Streets, empty
0‘s and any other available play area
re the arenas where these youngsters practice
% earn skills without supervision, play other neigh-
orhood teams, as they term it, “for money,” or
ngage in games for the sheer satisfaction derived
" rom competitive athletics. Their expression, very
ften because of the lack of supervision, takes an

nsocial form. Have you noticed the boy who
teals the “mickey” (potato) from the fruit stand,

 
   

ot because he really wants the potato, but simply
ecause of the thrill of the chase or because of the
dventure attached to cooking it at the “hideout”?
r have you considered the boy who “hitches” on
he back of an automobile, not because he wants
he ride, but because the cop on the beat will chase
.im and he will be able to hide in his mysterious
abyrinth, the cellar, areaway, or other nook which
nly he and “the gang” know well.

The two factors promoting these and all de-
linquent. acts, are recognition from the group and
‘the quest for adventure.” It is, then, the respon-
ibility of the recreation leader to provide adven-
ure of a social form or to substitute another in-
erest for it. Realization of the fact that clubs
hrive on competition will go far toward solving
his problem.

- At Hudson Guild, New York City, Junior Clubs
re organized with this assumption as the basis of
rganization. Well—planned leagues and tourna;
I nents serve as the means of sustaining interest in
group life. A leader is sent into the neighborhood
n early October when football is the children’s
‘ nain attraction. Groups found playing the game
' .re leagued together, depending on their age,
neight, weight and ability. A leader is then as—
igned to each group. It is his responsibility to
mprove skills, provide other interests and de-
'€10p the group from that point. The football
sague is followed by hockey, basketball, baseball,
tickball, volleyball and punchball leagues, de-

t 'ending on the season, and special tournaments

to enlist the interest of boys in

adventures of a constructive type

such as Olympics, relay
carnival, roller skating
carnival, and similar
events. These contests
are so scheduled as to
keep interest throughout
the entire year.

It is necessary, however, because of
certain undesirable outcomes of a high-
ly competitive program, to form some kind of
group which will help to smooth out problems and
plan programs. We found that this group could
work effectively when made up of two or more
representatives of each of the clubs, and could
serve to temper the competitive spirit with a co-
operative one. When playing our roller skate
hockey league, automobile traffic proved a danger-
ous menace. The Councilgroup, with the presi-
dent as spokesman, went to the neighborhood
police station, placed their complaint, and got very
favorable results.

Laws and Penalties

At the beginning of the 1936-37 season, this
Council, as we termed it, was organized in the

same way as a municipality, having as officers a

mayor, commissioner of sanitation, commissioner
of health, fire commissioner, police commissioner
and district attorney, who were elected following
a week’s campaigning by their friends. A rally at
which candidates spoke was held to stimulate this
interest. At a Council meeting held after the elec-
tion the jpbs of the officers were discussed and
many interesting projects planned. The question
of the function and powers of the municipal gov-
ernment, as against those of the federal and state
governments, was discussed. A number of laws
and penalties, particularly adapted to solve our
problems, were set up. They were as follows:

Throwing papers and other refuse around halls
and rooms is hereby prohibited. Offenders" will be
sentenced to sweep halls or do some other useful
work every day for two weeks, or' be barred from
the building for three weeks.

Breakage of furniture and house equipment is
prohibited. Offenders will be liable for the repair
of and payment for broken furniture or equip-
ment, or will be barred from the building for five

weeks.

435

436 MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION IN JUNIOR CLUB WORK

Writing on or defacing walls in any way is pro-
hibited. Offenders will be sentenced to wash and
clean marks on all fourth Hoor walls for one week

or more depending on the seriousness of the of- '

fence, or will be barred from the building for
live weeks.

Fighting with paper or water, which results in
the marring of walls or Hoor is hereby prohibited.
Offenders will be liable for the washing of the
walls or sweeping of the Hoor for a period of two
weeks, or-will be barred from the building for
five weeks.

Writing on toilet, room, or hall walls is hereby
prohibited. Offenders will be sentenced to wash
walls or do some other piece of useful work every
day'- for two weeks, or will be barred from the
building for three weeks.

Rough-housing in halls and rooms which re-
sults in annoyance to others is prohibited. Of-
fenders will be sentenced to go to the Play Group
in the assembly for three weeks, or' be barred
from the building for four weeks.

Rough-housing and running on stairs which en-
dangers the lives of others is hereby prohibited.
Offenders will be sentenced to be suspended from
the building for one week.

Duties of Officials

It became then the job of the Police Commis-
sioner, his staff and the other officers, to see that
these laws were observed and enforced. A regu-
lar court was formed to try offenders, the pro-
cedure and organization of which was as follows:
Judge;

Boys club” worker to preside.

Jury:

To be made up of six boys between the ages of
eleven and fourteen.

Cards to be sent to jurors notifying them of
their duty to serve.

Jury to be picked by Council members from
registration lists.

Jury must serve for three court meetings.
Defendant:

Entitled to fair trial.

May have witnesses to prove innocence.

Will be notified by card of day of trial.

Penalty to be enforced by boys worker or police
commissioner and staff, or by the attendance taker
at the door. I i

The Commissioner of Sanitation studied sani-

tary conditions in the House and how they could

be improved. "It was his finding that small waste-

Playparks in Great Britain

l I MONG the projects

as with the spon-
ship of the Coronation Planting Committee.
‘E er its direction Mr. Thomas Adams has pre-
w ed an attractively illustrated booklet entitled
l ' parks with suggestions for their design, equip—
‘ 1t and planting. This publication emphasizes
need and value of play and particularly the
ortance of planning play areas in such a way
hat they may afford an attractive setting for
cfivities.

In the first section of the publication it is
ointed out that no project is more important in
‘: hi development of character and physique “than
hqse that are designed to give healthy outdoor
' qcreation to children from infancy to adolescence.

.1. Another related measure is that of aiding in
I provision of community centers. . . . There is
 d for more coordination between those whose
l'orts are directed to provide means of recrea-
ion for young people above school age and those
‘ r o desire to see more effective methods em-
". ed to provide”healthy outdoor recreation for
‘h dren of and under school age.”

‘The term ‘playpark’ is used to define a play-
uncl that is laid out in combination with cer-
in park and garden features. It' is a playground

Resume of a pamphlet outlining Great
Britain's plans for the provision of
play spaces with attractive settings

In the preparation of Playparks Mr.
Adams and the Coronation Planting
Committee have made available valu-
able and attractive material which
should not only stimulate the devel-
opment of recreational areas through-
out Great Britain, but which should be
of great interest and value to recrea-
tion leaders in other countries. Copies
of the pamphlet may be secured from
the Committee at 68 Victoria Street.
LondonI S.W.|.I for one shilling each.

ped if possible as a
playpark, the children
can feel a sense of
liberty and ownership
that is impossible in
the school play-
ground.” On the other hand, it is pointed out
that where the school playground comprises from
four to six acres there may be no need for a play-
park in the same district.

The importance of play areas as a factor in re-
ducing street accidents is suggested by figures
showing that in Deptford with only 2.2% of its
area in open public space, 43.4% of the accidents
occurring are accidents to children. In compari-
son, in Westminster, another London borough
with over 25% of its area in public open space,
only 10% are accidents to children. “It is also
shown that in the first quarter of 1935 half of the
accidents to children in London occurred during
leisure time, namely, on Saturdays, Sundays and
on week days outside school hours.” Because play-
grounds under well trained play leaders help to
keep children off the streets' “it would appear to
be proper that contributions from the Road Fund
should be made toward the acquisition and layout
of playgrounds as a safety measure.”

Throughout the booklet the importance of pro- '
viding an attractive setting for children’s play is
repeatedly emphasized. Reference is made to the
games which arise from children’s imagination
and in which they secure such great delight, and
it is pointed out that the “inspiration for such
games comes with the presence of natural features
such as trees, rocks and pools with the opportuni-
ties they preSent for imaginary camping and
hunting.” Suggestions are offered as to ways in
which the land may be secured,
but it is pointed out “The only
way to obtain these play-
grounds together with park
areas is by public purchaSe.”
The cost of providing these
areas is partly offset by the
fact that “a well designed play—
ground surrounded by trees
and shrubs adds to the ameni-
ties and therefore increases
the value of all properties in

There is now available helpful material
for churches promoting drama as a part
of their program for young people. The
International Council of Religious Edu-
cation. 203 North Wabash Avenue. Chi-
cago. has issued a pamphlet entitled "A
Dramatic Calendar for Churches." con-
taining suggestions for dramatic programs
for outstanding events for each month.
This may be secured for twenty-five cents.
Among the material issued by the Divi-
sion of Plays and Pageants of the Metho-
dist Episcopal Church. 740 Rush Street.

called "Plays for the Church." Copies of
this maybe secured for twenty cents each.

A Religious Drama Festival

ed up until the plays were put
on. Then the light broke! As
the plays unfolded the churches
saw what we were attempting to do.

In spite of our efforts to explain the plan ade-
quately, there were three plays which had no deli-
nite religious message. However, these plays were
of high caliber and served the purpose of making
breaks between strictly Biblical plays. Some
churches produced plays requiring royalties, while
others put on non-royalty plays. In the opinion
of the judges the royalty plays were the best. The

winning plays were “The Old Candlemaker of
Saint John’s,” by Robert M. Gatke, “The Other

' Apostles,” by George E. Callahan, and “The Rec-

tor,” by Rachel Crothers.

Taking Stock

The directors of the plays did good work, but
when the festival was over they realized there
were many ways in which improvement could be
made. It was the consensus of opinion among the
directors that there would be a great advance next
year if the churches would pay the expenses of
an individual to attend an eight or ten weeks’
course in play directing. It was thought that the
small sum required by each church would be
amply repaid. The churches would have a relia-
ble person to carry on_ their work, and the wild
search for a producer which ensues whenever a
church decides to put on a play would be ended.
Lighting and stage eitects, it was felt, could have
been improved—~—a situation which will be rem-
edied when technical instruc-
tion is made available. It is
our intention to organize a
class in this important branch
of dramatics.

The crowds attending the
three-night festival were not
large. However, those who
did attend were impressed.
Their comments showed that
they had not expected so
successful an event, and next
year we feel confident that
the attendance will be a great
deal larger, The festival was

not publicized to any
great extent. This feature
of our next program will
be improved.

In pointing out the
weaknesses in our festi-
val we hope that other
groups promoting relig-
ious drama will profit by
our mistakes. We have
learned much by our ex-
perience. We know that
there is an abundance of potential dramatic abil-
ity available in the young people of the churches
—-enough to warrant the use of dramatics as a
definite part of a church recreation program. we
know that all groups who participated in the fes—
tival enjoyed their part in it and found great
satisfaction.

We in the churches have perhaps been lacking -

in initiative in opening up channels of expression
for our young people through drama. We believe
this situation can and should be remedied.

 

The Toledo Council of Churches had planned
to make its festival a non-competitive affair, but
when the second annual state-wide religious drama
festival was announced it was decided to use the
Toledo project, which preceded the state-wide
festival, as a county elimination contest, the win-
ner to compete in the finals of Dayton. The state—
wide festival was sponsored by the Christian
Youth Council of the Ohio Council of Religious
Education, and according to Mary E. Henderson,
secretary of the State Drama Committee, it is one
of the Council’s major projects.

The festival was open to all young people’s
groups in the churches of Ohio, the requirement
being that all players should be of amateur stahd—
ing and between the ages of fifteen and thirty.
Plays were chosen from an approved list; forty
minutes were allowed for presentation, with five
minutes for setting the scene
and five for clearing.

Each county set up its own
festival, every church entering
the county festival paying an
entry fee of 50 cents to the
county drama chairman. This
money was used to pay the
entry fee of $2.00 required of
the county winner entering the
state finals. All groups were

ROM JUNE 10 to I2, 1937, the Seventeenth Na-
tional Conference on State Parks was held at
arthmore College, Swarth'more, Pennsylvania,
here the delegates were the guest of the Penn-
lvania Parks Association. Park conservation,
elopment and administration, with special at—
tion to increased responsibility for planning
management resulting from the federal aid
ogram of emergency conservation work, were
cussed by delegates from all parts of the coun—
Colonel Richard Lieber of Indianapolis was
cted president for his sixth consecutive term.

The first session of the conference was devoted
3 t a discussion of the general topic, “Relation of
tte Federal Government to State Parks.” Conrad
J L. Wirth, assistant director of the National 5 Park
Service in charge of the Branch of Recreational
I anning and State Cooperation, stated that three
nsiderations should constitute the foundation of
deral and state cooperation in park work: (I)
basic understanding of objectives; (2) re-
'zation that national parks and state parks are
equal importance in their own fields of recre-
ional service, and (3) realization that while
deral and state park authorities are working in
fferent fields, each group can learn much from
e other.

I “State Park Legislation” was the general topic
for discussion at the Thursday afternoon session
; hen a comprehensive review of such legislation

it the various states was given by Roy A. Vetter,
assistant attorney of the National Park Service.

Friday morning's session was devoted to state
park organization, and a bird’s—eye view was given

f methods followed in various. states. An inter-
iting topic of discussion was the work of the
'Civilian Conservation Corps in state parks.

The importance of acceptance of responsibility
for future developments on the part of the states
'35 emphasized by Director Arno B. Cammerer
«if the National Park Service who said:

“During the last year a number of the states
have taken steps to meet their responsibility. Sev-
eral states have recently enacted legislation for the
first time setting up park authorities and em-
' powering them according to the best known prac-
tices. Several others have extended and improved

:the scope of their park boards’ or commissions’

functions, and there have been gratifying in-
creases in state park budgets. There is, generally,
increased recognition in law of public .park and
recreation services as a primary function of gov-
ernment, evidenced by the more definite trend to
consider Such services on a parity with other fun-
damental governmental functions. The court de-
cisions likewise have recognized that park and
recreation services are governmental rather than

proprietary functions. The selection of areas and
their integration into a state-wide coordinated sys—
tem have been given more definite consideration.
This has meant more basic studies in their evalua-

tion and‘ selection and a greater emphasis upon

their distribution in order to meet human needs;
more attention to careful planning for their de—

_velopment, and greater concern for the achieve—

ment of individual and social benefits to be de-
rived from their use by the people.

“Encouraging as these accomplishments are, it
must nevertheless be admitted that the problem-
and the possibilities have, for the country as a
whole, been little more than touched. The prob-
lem that each state now faces, if it has not already
done so, is the establishment of a park authority,
adequately financed, wisely empowered and pro-
perly staffed, both with administrators trained
and eXperienced in park and recreation work and
with properly qualified technical advisers. There
is no other way to carry on the work that has been
so generously augmented by funds and services
from the federal government, and there is no'
other way of guaranteeing the freedom of local in-
genuity and creativity that should govern the de-
velopment of each state park system. While there
are certain general principles that apply to all
park work, the individual adaptations of them and
of park_technique can best be made by the states
themselves; otherwise the state park in California
is apt to be the same as the one in Maine.”

The importance of adequate long-term planning
was emphasized by Colonel S. P. Wetherill, Jr.,
founder and former president of the Tri-State
Regional Planning Federation.

The conference closed with a trip through Fair-
rnount Park, Philadelphia, and a number of other
parks in the region.

You Asked for It!

Question: We are planning to open a com-
munity center this fall and we want, of course, to
make the center as widely known as possible
among the people of the neighborhood. What
methods have other cities employed in inviting
people to the centers? . .

Answer: A well lighted entrance and building
are the best possible invitations. But in addition
there should be folders taken home by the chil-
dren describing the program and listing the ac-
tivities to be conducted, posters in store windows,
newspaper publicity, radio announcements, word
of mouth invitations, and handbills.

Just before the social centers of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, opened last year the Electric Transit
Company carried huge placards in the front of
each street car, and a huge electric sign at City
Hall blazoned forth the message, “Social Centers
Open This W'eek.”

The director of the Newton Community Cen-
ter, Board of Education, Newark, New Jersey,
issued the following invitation to neighborhood
folks: .

“You, your family and your friends are cordi-
ally invited to visit our center on any Tuesday or
Friday from 7:00 to 11:00 P. M. and join happy
groups in the gymndsium playing volley ball, in-
door tennis, basketball and other games. Observe
the craft groups—the men repairing radio sets,
building miniature Spanish galleons, while the
women knit and sew as their fancy pleases. In
other parts of the building younger groups are
enjoying dancing and fencing and in the game
rooms the card tables, ping pong tables and other
types of quiet games attract both sexes and all
ages.

“All these activities and others are offered to
those who become members of the community
center, and all that is asked of those who desire
to become members is that they abide by a few
community center rules and regulations which are
merely formulated so that the majority may en-
joy their leisure moments in an" atmosphere which
is in harmony with that prescribed by society in
general. '

“Come to the center and register. Mingle with
your friends in any activity that is offered. Give
yourself a chance to grow mentally and physically.

MISS NELL MILLER of

Texas, describes an in-
teresting handcraft project conducted last sum-

project was the creation of a museum of natural
history for which each child in the class con-
structed some type of animal or phase of life in
which he was particularly interested. Animals
made of beaver board and heavy cardboard were
painted or colored with crayons and placed in a
typical environment. Corrugated boxes, secured
at no cost from local stores, were used for the
setting. Colored cellophane was placed back of
holes cut in the top and sides of the box produc-
ing an attractive lighting effect. White cellophane
was used on the front of the box for glass. The
inside of the box was painted blue with cloud
effects and the outside black. When the project
had been completed each child looked up the his-
tory of his subject and this was typed and pasted
on the side of the box. An exhibit was held at the

were amateur photography, collections of various
kinds, clay modeling, leather stamping, and fancy
work done by men. There were contests in
checker playing, fiddling, play production and
singing, together with talks on hobbies by a noted

artist.

A New Playground Association— Scotch
Mains, New Jersey, a community of about 4,000
, people, has organized a Playground Association
u,".l:r\1corporated for the purpose of assisting trained
‘ lecreation leaders in promoting recreational pro-
ams. The association is supplementing the work
I f the playground directors at the County Park
. layground by planning special events and enter—
fainments such as a display of fireworks on the
. ourth of July and by purchasing athletic equip-
' ent in addition to that regularly supplied by the
ark Commission.

  
  

Detroit’s Municipal Camp—Last summer the
amp at Brighton, Michigan, conducted by the
‘ etroit Recreation Department took care of over
,700 children. At a charge of a dollar a day food
;. nd shelter were provided, and the children en-
oyed boating, horseback riding and other activi-
‘es, and learned Red Cross life saving.

 

‘ Making Horseshoes Available—In Wari-
anco Park, maintained by the Union County,
‘ ew Jersey, Park Commission, horseshoes are
btainable at the refreshment'stand. A dollar de-

osit is required but no charge is made for the
se of the shoes.

A Playground “Gradu.ation”—The “gradua—

hich comes at tlie close of the summer season
nd as a climax to it. It was a gala affair this year,
pened by the Mayor and presided over by the
hairman _of the Recreation Commission, acting

The first event was the awarding of medals and
.ertificates to the seventy-five boys and girls who
ad earned the Fair Play Club Awards. These

‘ wards put no premium on winning or on athletic
, bility, but are given to the children on each play-
;round who are leaders in participation, service
l'ind character. Following the awards, 350 children
irom the playgrounds presented a patomime
'iageant of “Sleeping Beauty” in costumes made
)y themselves, using properties made by an adult
:ducation art class project. A number of dances
Ivere woven' into the story. After the pageant a
ield and track meet was held for boys, one boy
from each playground being entered for the base-
all throw for distance, broad jump and 100 yard
lash, and four from every ground for the 44 yard

to the points made in inter-playground competi-

summer, on display before and after the main
program, attracted considerable attention.

A Playground for Chinese Children—A play
ground designed primarily for the children of
Chinatown, New York City, was opened early in
September, another step in the program to pro-
vide increased recreational facilities for the resi-
dents of Chinatown and other children in the sec-
tion. The playground occupies one and three:
quarter acres and has facilities for baseball, volley
ball, paddle tennis and other sports. It contains a
small shelter where mothers may sit in the shade
while the children play.

At the Annual Meeting of the School Garden
Association of America—From June 28th to
July I, 1937, the School Garden Association of
America held its twenty-seventh annual meeting
in Detroit, Michigan, in connection with the an-
nual meeting of the National Education Associa-
tion. Leaders in the movement presented reports
of developments throughout the country. N 0 city

446

represented at the conference reported on a longer
period of operation of gardens than did Detroit.
Initiated in 1905 by the Twentieth Century Club,
a woman’s organization, the children’s garden pro-
gram was conducted by volunteers for eight years
when it was established as a regular activity of
the Board of Education and became affiliated with
the 4-H Clubs, a few years later being taken over
by the Recreation Department. The program has
enjoyed a steady development, with canning cen-
ters during the World War, meetings of 'the
groups conducted by boy and girl officers, exhibits,
flower festivals and an annual achievement day.

Interesting features of the meeting included
visits to school gardens, to the garden center spon-
sored by garden clubs, to the Fordson High School
with its unusual horticultural department and to
the horticultural gardens located on property
which is part of the homestead of Henry Ford’s
father. Here garden instruction is given children
of the Fordson Junior High School and the Ford-
son High School. Each student of the junior high
school has a garden plot 20 by 60 feet, while the
senior high school group members have gardens
of 40 by 60 feet. A visit was also made to Mr.

the Division of Recreation of the Park Depart-
ment, -Framingham, Massachusetts, was the mak-
ing of a jigsaw map of the United States. The
map fitted together shows the larger cities, capi-
tals of states and important rivers. This project
had a two—fold feature: correlation with the his—
tory and geography classes and the development
of skill in wood carving, the use of tools and the
promotion of ' creative ability in the children.

part of the recreation service of the city.

Some. Values of the Service

A recreation program for the shut—in child gives
a double service. It not only brings happiness to
the boys and girls, but gives the parents an op—
portunity for some relaxation from a great physi—
cal and mental strain and worry. Although this
latter benefit may not be admitted by the parent
in most instances, it nevertheless cannot be denied.
Eight months of this type of service has only
opened up other avenues into which this program
may be directed. Elderly people whose eyes are
growing dim with age have asked for the readers
to visit their homes. With an increased staff this
and many other services may be added as very
important phases of a recreation program. One
private organization has ‘given benefit shows to

satisfactory in its operation that none of the in-
stitutions would be without this service.” Thus
the WPA Supervisor of Education and Recrea-
tion in State Institutions commented on his Wis—
consin program. And then he gives this indication
that: none need be without this service. “At a re-
cent meeting of the Board of Control a close
analysis was made of the value of individual lead-
ership and their retention decided upon. This was
for the purpose of making the project a perma-
nent part of the work of the Board after the pas-
sage and signing by the Governor of the Bien-
nium Budget.”

Whether or not the program is immediately
taken up and carried on by the hospitals, prisons,
asylums and the rest, its effect upon these institu-
tions has been permanent. Doctors, criminologists
and parents will insist on the retention of methods
which have done so much to rehabilitate the han-
dicapped. Nurses of their own volition have taken
courses preparing them to assist in this work. In
the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue Hospital
nurses in training are required to attend classes of
demonstration and instruction in recreational
therapy conducted by WPA leader-5.. Also, dur-

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
    
     
   
 
 
  
     
        
  
 
   

ing the training period they assist the leader
their work with patients.

And patients will continue to write letters
this one from Seaview Hospital, Staten Isl
New York. “Most of us have been confined
for a lengthy period . . . are prone to devote
much time to thinking of our troubles . . . are
to become mentally stagnant. This work you
carrying on comes as a blessing to us, takin
away from the deadly monotony of our daily
istence. So for myself, and the rest of the n
of this ward, I thank you.”

The Art of Pitching Horseshoe

(Continued from page 422)

issue of The Horseshoe World, states:

“In sighting the shoe one should either bring the
up in front of the face with the arm extended, or s
it up there for the aim. Some players use the br
arm method of sighting the shoe, which means that
shoe is sighted with the elbow pointing down, an
hand and forearm raised, so that the stake cuts the
between the eye and the stake. Practice will make e
method successful. After the shoe has been held ju
instant for the aim, the back swing is started, the
passing by the right leg, and to a point back of
player, where it cannot be swung any farther wi
discomfort or loss of balance. This point of hesit
in the back swing, before the forward swing is starte
known as the termination point in the back swing.
shoe is then swung forward and released before the

straight and swung from the shoulder, like the pend L
of a clock. This is known as the pendulum swing.
weight of the shoe is sufiicient to build up enough
mentum to carry the shoe over the forty feet of s
between the stakes. The shoe is never pitched, to
thrown, pushed or heaved towards the stake. It is swu

Ali the termination point (end of thesbackw
swing and the start of the forward swing)
pitcher, if right-handed, should step forward
the left foot and swing the delivery arm for\
with an easy and natural sweep. In case the s
is turning too much, or not enough, the pitc
should shift his grip on the shoe slightly betw ;'
the toe and heel calks. ‘

Rhythm and timing of the swing are import 5

factors in the game of horseshoes. The pitc

should aim to pitch for rhythm by using a 1

swing and keeping the arm straight as stated ‘-
Brown. There should be as little knee actio 
possible. The' body should be bent forward 
perfect balance should be‘ maintained at all ti 
during the delivery of the shoe. “

Mr. Miller can tell many interesting tales of
he creation of important collections by children
nd the devious and varied means they employ to
btain stamps. Old trunks and family records are
ansacked, business houses are solicited for en-
elopes, juvenile dealers are consulted, and,
hough the practice is not encouraged, even pub—
'c dumps are searched.

In connection with the latter, Mr. Miller re-
alls that one of the most valuable collections in
artford, a city widely known for its interest in
hilately, was started from stamps obtained from
dumping ground. The collection, which was
ears in the making, recently was appraised for
x purposes at over $50,000, and the collector
eadily admitted some of his earliest and most
aluable items came from envelopes he found on
ublic dumps as a boy.

lends a hand to those who look upon her beauti—

appreciation of the magnitude and grandeur of
much of our scenery dwarfs the petty problems
which may seem insurmountable in many Ameri-

Safety For Supervised Playgrounds

Prepared by the Education Division, National Safety
C0unc11, One Park Avenue, New York City. Price 25¢.

TODAY WHEN the public playground and the trained

play supervisor are considered necessities in every
progressive municipality, the element of safety in chil-
dren’s play assumes a place 'of great importance. The
playground Offers the child happiness and security only
so long as it affords protection and this protection is a
combination of training and environment.

This new pamphlet is a guide to the director in check-
ing dangerous conditions and keeping him alert to the
fact that every piece of apparatus, every activity, even the
surface Of the playground, holds possibilities for acci-
dents. Especially valuable are the sections on the safe
use of apparatus, the safety programs which have been
used successfully in a number of cities, and the new ideas
for stimulating interest in safety. A summary of the ac-
cident experience of twenty-four Cleveland playgrounds
during the summer of 1936 shows that among the play-
ground patrons no age is immune from accident. A two-
year Old'and an eighteen-year-Old were among the casual—
ties reported that season. ‘The pamphlet also contains ex-
plicit directions for procedure in case of injury and a
sample accident report. A number of attractive photo-
graphs taken on playgrounds show well-planned game
areas and children at play using various apparatus in the
prOper way. '

Hunting With the Microscope

recreation, this booklet will commend itself to all
who do their hunting with scientific instruments. An-
other book Of the Leisure League series designed for

Personality and the Cultural Pattern

By James S. Plant, MD. The Commonwealth Fund,

New York City. $2.50.

N HIS NEW BOOK Dr. Plant has gathered up the fruits

of fourteen years of clinical observatiOn of children and
parents. He has had a growing conviction that the en.-
vironment Of the individual—that is, the cultural pattern
in which he lives—has much to do with the kind of
motivation which expresses itself in personality traits.
This interplay of environment or cultural pattern upon
personality is the central theme of the book.

Naturally the type Of cultural pattern determines in a
measure the type of personality Of the individual. There
have been in the past God—centered patterns, family-cen-
tered patterns, and state-centered patterns. At present,

456 NEW PUBLICATIONS IN THE LEISURE TIME FIELD

Dr. Plant contends, we are moving into an individual-
centered cultural pattern. Social thinking necessarily cen—
ters, therefore, around the individual with its inner moti—
vations and the outer influences of its environment. We
now accept the fact that if we are to change the indi-
vidual we can probably bring about such change more
effectively by altering the environment in which the in-
dividual lives than by probing his inner motives: We
therefore ask these questions: What does family life do
to the personality of the child? What part_ does the
school, the church, the law and industry play.in the de-
veIOpment of personality? What is the function of rec-
reation in personality deveIOpment? What kind of edu-
cation, and how much education, do we need to get in
order to secure the best results in personality develop-

ment?

The chapter on “Recreation” is a challenging. one: “It
is perhaps true,” says Dr. Plant, “that in our recreational
life we can bring into play the entire integrated per—
sonality as we cannot elsewherew—and it is perhaps true
that this is precisely the reason that we gain such re—
freshment in the most wholehearted undertaking of rec-
reation.” The most serious problem in the recreation
field, he says, “is not one of deveIOping a_ polished set of
techniques but of eliciting and strengthening these highly
desirable informal elements which already eiiist. An
institutional structure is probably required—but its policy
should be that of inviting rather than regimentation.”

This volume is not easy reading but it will repay the
careful study which recreation executives and others may
give it. Reviewed by E. C. PVorman.

The Relationship of City Planning tO
School Plant. Planning.

By Russell A. Holy, Ph. D. Bureau of Publications,
Teachers College, Columbia University, New York.
'$l.60.

City planning is at last beginning to assume the place
in community life to which its importance has long en-
titled it and which municipalities have been slow to
recognize. And in intelligent city planning school plant
planning must be an essential consideration. This study
by Dr. Holy published with the approval of Professor
N. L. Engelhardt, has had two purposes: ( 1) to investi—
gate and appraise the degree of existing articulation of
school building planning and city planning, and (2) to
formulate recommendations for the improvement of both
city planning and school planning by means of a better
articulation.
