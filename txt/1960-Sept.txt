“my grandfather makes the best play-
ground equipment in the whole world

because he loves little people like me!
he makes slides and swings and see-saws and all kinds
of things. they’re real strong and they’re very safe.
if you’re going to buy playground things you better
talk to my grandfather first. his name is mr. burke.”

RECREATION

The Challenges of Service

SEPTEMBER 1960

——ROY SORENSON, 1960 \Vhite House Conference on Children

and Youth.

RECREATION greets you with a new for-

mat this month—a symbol of its con-

tinuing growth, and its acceptance of
the challenges of the future to expand its
service to the recreation field. For over fifty
years, the magazine has continually grown,
and planned its content to meet the needs
of each new era.

Predictions for tomorrow imply great
and drastic changes in our American pat-
tern of living, necessitating a much broader
concept of leisure and of recreation. As Fos-
ter Rhea Dulles points out in The Nation’s
Children, “Increase in leisure is surely one
of the most significant social changes of the
twentieth century.”

This change will affect every community,
large and small; and you, the personnel of
recreation departments, are already being
called upon to take the lead in providing
more recreation services, facilities, and lei-
sure-time interests for a larger p0pulation.
As your own growth as leaders and as in-
terpreters of recreation is challenged, so
RECREATION Magazine, too, is challenged to
broader service. We take this opportunity,
therefore, to rededicate this magazine to
meeting your growing needs, and those of
your communities. It will devote itself to
pointing up new and exciting trends, bring-
ing inspiration, information and direction
where and when most needed.

From the contents as well as appearance,
of this issue (September 1960), you will
note that RECREATION already is adapting
its coverage to change. For example, a more
comprehensive perSpective of recreation
must embrace the family, school, church, in-
stitutions—in fact, all people; and RECREA-
TION will cover these more fully than previ-
ously. It now carries among its new features
a section Specifically planned to help lead-

ers working with the ill and handicapped,
and another for leaders of church recreation
groups. A new regular feature on the main-
tenance of recreation buildings, areas, other
facilities, and equipment, “Concerning Up-
keep,” will be based on the practical experi-
ence of our readers. (Contributions wel-
come.) Still another new section, “Recrea-
tion Digest,” is designed to bring you, in
condensed form, articles that have appeared
in magazines or other publications you are
not apt to see. We hope it can grow as time
goes on.

You will note an “As We Go to Press”
section, printed on color stock. This will
handle late news and announcements of na-
tional interest, as well as information for-
merly appearing on the “Things You Should
Know” page; and it will be the very last
page to go to press. (Deadline for it will be
the fifth of each month preceding date of
publication. Information selected will
promptly be in the hands of our over ten
thousand subscribers, so keep that date in
mind.) Another color page lists free aids
for those buying recreation equipment and
materials. Other new features will be added
from time to time, as required, to cover the
widening range of recreation activities and
interests.

Serving Tennis

Sirs:

It certainly was with a great deal of
delight that I recently received a copy
of your magazine [June] in which was
printed an article, “The Upswing in
Tennis.” If we are really to promote
tennis throughout the United States it
must be done through our recreation
leaders because it is through the action
of municipalities in furnishing tennis
facilities that we will be able to greatly
eXpand the development of tennis and
the interest in this game.

It has always been the sincere hope
and desire of the USLTA to work hand-
in-hand with the recreation leaders of
our country in pointing out the tre-
mendous advantage of the game that
can keep one in condition during his
entire life and can be played under the
same set of rules and regulations in
every nation in the world.

dent, United States Lawn Tennis As-

Tremendous lIelp

Sirs:

Before leaving my ollice tonight for
retirement, I wanted to [eXpress my]
appreciation of the services which . . .
the National Recreation Association
[has rendered] to me individually and
to our commission, to say nothing of
the various states and nations.

You probably would never realize
how much it means to those of us who
are [recreation] executives in the vari-
ous cities to have an organization such
as the National Recreation Association
behind us in the things we do. The help
which I have received over the years
from the NRA has been tremendous
and I will never cease to be grateful for
the same.

While checking out information for
our June issue (“State and Local Dc-

across the followingr amusing (but con-
fusing) information. lt is a choice ex-
ample of the booby traps besctting the
paths of editors!

Sirs:

There is some local controversy over
the name of the new state park in Scho-
harie County. The origin of the name
of “Toe I’ath MountainH is obscnrc and
some local residents believe that it
should be “Towpath.” Towpaths are a
feature found in connection with canals.
Since there has never been a canal in
this area there seems no jnstilication

It seems to me there are several points 1313 East 60th Street Chicago 3 r, Illinons
of view to this question, and the first is:
Why do we harp on juvenile delinquen-

ball, golf, etcetera, and give little at-
tention to the other factors which are
so important to so many old, infirm,
and sick people, as well as those who,
for various reasons, cannot be too phy-
sically active.

One of the problems of today is, ill
my opinion, that with the crowded con-
ditions in the cities, sooner or later
every bit of open space will be utilized
for baseball, football, tennis, and so on,
so that the grass and trees and flowers
will disappear and there will be none
of the surroundings left which give
peace, contentment, and relaxation.

The question is asked whether or-
ganized recreation helps with juvenile
delinquency. It certainly does, without
question, for if you can give any human
being something he would rather do
than what he is now doing he will
change his habits.

[However] I definitely feel that
[sports] are not the entire answer.
There are many, both young and old.
who would like to work to earn money
or to be busy in this manner if given an
opportunity, and in many communities
organizations have been set up to assist
the teenagers in obtaining part-time
work. Young people should be trained
and influenced to acccpt responsibili-
ties, to learn the value of money, and
how . . . to get and keep a job.

Things You Should Know

} CONSOLIDATION of all recreation serv-
ices and facilities in New York City
under one city department is nearing
reality, with civic groups actively sup-
porting such a move, according to the
New York Herald Tribune’s city-hall
reporter, Laurence Barrett. Robert
Moses, who recently retired as park
commissioner after thirty-six years, op-
posed the idea. Now, with a new park
commissioner, Newbold Morris, and
with consideration of a proposed new
city charter, such consolidation would
appear nearer.

Two influential agencies, the City
Administrator’s Office and the State
Commission 011 Governmental Opera-
tions of New York City, have becomc
increasingly sympathetic to the move,
according to Mr. Barrett. (Both agen-
cies havc consulted recently with the
National Recreation Association.) The
nine agencies involved in such consoli-
dation are parks, education, health, hos-
pitals, correction, police, welfare, hous-
ing authority, and the youth board.

} IN A PRECEDENT-SHATTERINC STEP,
the Conference for National Coopera-
tion in Aquatics has announced that its
tenth annual meeting at Yale Univer-
sity, November 16-18, will be open to
anyone interestcd in aquatics. Registra-

tion blanks may be obtained by writing

to CNCA at 1201 Sixteenth Street,
V.W.. Washington 6. DC. Purpose of

the CNCA is to provide a setting for
national organizations with swimming

programs to share and discuss common
aquatic problems.

) AN 85-PACE COMPOSITE REPORT of
the 1960 White House Conference on
Children and Youth forum findings,
simply entitled Recommendations, is
now available from the U.S. Govern-
ment Printing Office, Washington 25,
DC. ($.35) . The resolutions on recre-
ation and leisure time made by the
twelve workgroups in Forum VI on
Free Time appeared in the June issue
of RECREATION. While the approved
Recommendations has a section on
“Leisure” per se, the need for more
recreation is refiected throughout the
other sections including such categories
as minority groups, the mentally handi-
capped, and neighborhood programs.

) REAL ESTATE DEVELoPERs have been
raising objections about being required
to contribute a prescribed amount of
land, or its equivalent in money, toward
the acquisition of community play sites
constructing new residential
areas. Now a developer in Newburgh,
New York, has questioned the constitu-
tionality of such measures and is taking
the matter to court. Developers have
been claiming that the fee system is an
inequitable distribution of a tax burden
and that the local regulations govern-
ing use of these funds, based on permis-
sive state legislation, are too vague.

Final Report Adopted

At its meeting on June 16, 1960, the
American Medical Association House of
Delegates adopted the final report of
the Committee to Study the Relation-
ships of Medicine with Allied Health
Professions and Services. “Allied” per-
sonnel include: recreation therapists,
music therapists, lay psychoanalysts,
psychiatric social workers, and public
health educators.

A board committee of five members,
to be known as The Committee on Rela-
tionships of Medicine with Allied
Health Professions and Services, has
been appointed by the board of trustees
to continue AMA activity in this vitally
important area. In its report the study
committee asked the medical profession
“to provide greater assistance in cre-
ating a unifying force at the local, state,
and national level. Coordinated plan-
ning and assistance in recruitment, edu-
cation, and professional growth appear
to be the major challenges which have
not been fully met by the medical pro-
fession in relationships with them vi-
tally important professional and techni-
cal groups.”

Among the committee’s recommenda-
tions are:

The medical profession and allied
professional and technical groups
should COOperatively seek appropriate
definition of educational and training
standards and interprofessional rela-
tions. Formal liaison to discuss inat-
ters of common concern should be es-
tablished.

Mechanisms for effective voluntary
regulation and discipline are essential
for all scientific, professional, and tech-
nical groups concerned with health care
in order to meet their inherent obliga-
tions. For these reasons, and since such
regulation is desired by groups which
provide information and services to
physicians and to patients under the di-
rcction of physicians, this procedure is
actively supported by the medical pro-
fcssion.

Since voluntary regulation is a pro-
fessional requisite, it must exist even if
concomitant statutory regulations are
enacted. It should be noted that be-
cause many persons allied to medicine
are not involved in direct service to pa-
tients and for other reasons, the ques-
tion of governmental regulations has
not been raised by them or by related
groups of physicians.

The future sc0pc of activities of the
American Medical Association directed
towards developing cooperative efforts
with allied health professions and serv-
ices should be along the following lines,
as outlined in the report.

Specific exploratory conferences
should be held with members of seg-
ments of sciences allied to a given area
of medical practice with the national

Agreement should be sought in 
proper field of activity for each of th 
groups.

Reciprocal exchange of informati
should be provided by the participati
of allied scientists and members
health professions in AMA meeti
and publications and encouraging
participation of physicians in meeti ,
and publications of their scientific a
professional societies.

Effective liaison should be provi
between AMA representatives and pr
fessional and technical personnel \
should review relationships and pr
vide plans for effective coordination
recruitment, education. and service

The Constant Search
Delegate Bill Shumard of Oakland, California, upon

his return from the cllst National Recreation Congress,
reported to his recreation commission: “More than any-
thing I know of, recreation is a flexible ever-changing
profession and program. We in this profession are con-
stantly seeking information, administrative ideas, ethe-
real inspirations, and practical know-hows to keep us
always up with and, if possible, ahead of the inconstant
desires and needs of the people we serve . . . .

“It isn’t enough that we start planning to have hula
hoops during the height of the fad—we need to be sufii-
ciently alert to see_the fad coming and be able to program
for it and be at the height of our endeavors at the time
the participants are most enthused . . . . We have a re-
sponsibility to our communities to keep alert to all new
developments Whether relating to personnel, program-
ing, or facilities.

“To me, it is tremendously important that I be allowed
to attend a national conference every year or so and a

state conference annually.”

RECREATION  

Edward H. Thacker

WELCOME to Washington! As host
to the 42nd National Recreation
Congress, the District of Columbia Rec-
reation Board extends its warmest grect-
ings to all. Though the Congress de-
serves your first attention, we hope you
find time to visit our local recreation
and park facilities. Sightseeing and fa-
cility tours are scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, Septem-
ber 28. Additional tours can be conducted on Friday.

By Congressional act, the recreation board was estab-
lished as a central agency to which anyone may turn on
matters concerned with recreation in the district. The seven-

 

member board represents the citizens of Washington and
the principal agencies providing physical facilities for rec-
reation: the district government, the board of education,
and the National Capital Parks. By agreement with these
and other agencies the board operates a program of super-
vised recreation at playgrounds, school recreation centers,
housing projccts, and park areas in all city neighborhoods.
The board determines policy and directs the superintendent
of recreation to establish administrative and organizational
procedures within the structure of the recreation depart-
ment.

The recreation system plan was developed by the National
Capital Planning Commission as a part of the comprehensive
plan for orderly development of the city. Systematic review
enables the commission and the recreation department to
reflect city growth and new concepts of rccreation. The
plan calls for neighborhood playgrounds within walking
distance of every residence in the city. Cluslers of ncighbor-
hoods are also scrved by a major recrcation center with a
greatcr variety of facilitics. Thesc twcnty-six nlajor ccnters

IN OUR CONGRESS -

The Washington recreation
department prepares to greet

42nd National Recreation Congress delegates.

CITY

 

are usually adjacent to and a part of a junior or senior high
school. Whenever feasible the neighborhood playgrounds
are in conjunction with an elementary school. Special fa-
cilities for community use are included in all new schools
when these are erected at a location designated for recrea-
tion in the recreation system plan. Special adult centers are
located strategically in the city.

Several original pieces of equipmcnt havc recently been
developed. These items were created by members of the
staff and constructed by craftsmen at National Capital
Parks. A gaily colored plywood train, a treadmill, and a
rocket slide called “Spoofnik” are already installed. Pic-
tures of this equipment are on display at the department’s
Congress exhibit. Staff memhers are always encouraged to
submit ideas for new equipment.

The department seeks to provide a diversified program
to attract an even greater number of participants. Unit
leaders are free to develop those activities which will be
most successful in their neighborhood. At the same time
they endeavor to introduce new activities which will bring
in new participants and broaden the recreation skills of all.
A core of popular programs are coordinated on a citywide
basis. Some of these will be described in detail. (See also
“Roving Leaders Extend Our Reach,” RECREATION, April

1960.)

The preschool play program is designed to give children
three and four years of age an opportunity to meet and play
with children their own age away from the home setting.
In this respect it is a prekindergarten program with empha-
sis on recreation rather than education. The department
furnishes a leader for each group and relies on parent volun-

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
   

teers for extra assistance. More than fifty groups, ranging
from fifteen to thirty children, meet two hours daily from
October to May. Each group has a parents’ club to schedule
volunteer duty and these often conduct study groups on
child behavior, growth, and development. Representatives
from each group meet as the Parents’ Council. This group
has been of immeasurable help in securing facilities and
leadership through increased funds.

Day camping is also a very p0pular activity each summer.
Ten camps are provided in wooded parks within the city.
Children seven to fourteen years of age spend two-week
sessions in these camps. Four separate camping periods are
scheduled each summer. Program emphasis is on nature
and campcraft with naturalists from National Capital Parks
supplementing the skills of our own leaders. One camp is
organized specifically for orth0pedically handicapped chil-
dren. Cooperation is secured from United Cerebral Palsy,
the D. C. Health Scho'ol, and the Public Health Depart-
ment. Located at the rear of the health school, the depart-
cnt has installed special equipment for those requiring
wheelchairs or crutchcs. A sand table has coved sides so
that wheelchairs can move right up to the sand.

Washington’s answer to Little League Baseball is the
Valter Johnson Memorial Leagues. More than 150 teams in
lcagues divided by age (12 and under, 13 and 14 years old)
are coached by staff memhers and sponsored, when possible,
by local business establishments. As many teams are or-
ganized as are needed to permit every boy who wishes to be

SEPTEMBER 1960

on a team. The season ends with selection of a city champion
in each age group.

In spite of the interest in baseball, softball continues to
gain in popularity. Last year the Amateur Softball Associa-
tion announced the District of Columhia had more youth
softball teams than any state in the nation, for the second
consecutive year. Many playgrounds have a playground
league that winds up the season with championship play-offs.
There are also nine regional leagues whose games culminate
in a city championship. Though there are fewer girls than
boys, the former are eager softballers and produce outstand-
ing teams. Men and women are also enthusiastic softball
participants.

Model building consistently draws hosts of craftsmen.
Airplane and boat-building contests are annual affairs, with
the last airplane contest drawing fifteen hundred entries.
Regional finalists enter citywide competition, and all models
are displayed prominently about town.

Adults also have their share of activity. More than eighty
groups are organized around the participants’ special in-
terests, which range from art and woodworking to bridge
and judo. The department will provide virtually any course
for which facilities and an instructor can be found. Par-
ticipants pay a small fee to cover the cost of the instructor
and necessary supplies.

With the expectation of a National Cultural Center in
Washington before too long, Washington is taking a re-
newed interest in the performing arts. Many self-organized
groups seek help from the recreation department in present-
ing ballet, modern dance, operatic, or musical programs. The
department supplements these events with its ‘ own civic
symphony orchestra, choral group, drama workshops, and
so on. With the cooperation of the local musicians’ union,
a series of concerts is presented each summer at the Water-
gate near Lincoln Memorial. Art fairs, photographic salons,
hobby shows, folk-dance festivals, and their ilk round out a
well-balanced cultural schedule for the city of Washington.

Washington has a number of armed services installations
in the area. Hostesses for their dances and entertainment
for their parties are provided by the department through
the Capital Cirls’ Society and Volunteer Community Shows.
Single girls between eighteen and twenty-three, along with
amateur and professional entertainers, provide these much-
welcomed services.

At Christmas time the lighting of the national community
Christmas tree is a tradition started by the recreation de-
partment many years ago. Though the project’s sc0pe has
been enlarged, the department is still an active participant.
Similarly the department assists with the annual Fourth of
July program at Washington Monument.

There are many other activities worth noting, not the
least of which is the Children’s Theatre of W’ashington.
Now in its fourteenth year, this group prescnts plays and
dance programs of special appeal to children. Often the ac-
tors themselves are children selected from our playgrounds.

Members of the D.C. Recreation Department in atten-
dance at the Congress will be wearing either a cherry-blos-
som boutonniére or corsage. Do not hesitate to ask any of
them for information about recreation in Washington.

“ HE National Cultural Center is

destined to stand as a monument
to America’s cultural maturity and to
her realization that the conquest of ma-
terial things cannot stand the test of
time until they find fruition in the
realm of the mind and soul. The peoples

 

of fifty sovereign states, sharing a love
for the political freedoms of self-government, seek in the
creation of a cultural center a concrete expression of their
common attachment to the arts.”

50 reads the general concept of the National Cultural
Center as set out in the bylaws, adopted by its board of
trustees, at its second meeting on April 27, 1959.

The National Cultural Center, or, to use a more descrip-
tive name, the National Cultural Center for the Performing
Arts, was established as a burcau of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion by an act of Congress signed by President Eisenhower
on September 2, 1958.

The National Cultural Center Act provides that the Cen-
ter’s board of trustees shall:

0 Construct, maintain, and administer a National Cultural

mittee on the Arts of the National Cultural Center.

Center in Washington, D.C., to consist of a building and
related facilities with funds to be raised by Voluntary con-
tributions on a site to be provided by the federal govern-
ment and the District of Columbia;

0 Present classical and contemporary music, drama, dance,
poetry, and opera from this and other countries; present
lectures and other programs; provide facilities for other
civic activities, and

0 Develop programs for children and youth and the elderly
(and for other age groups as well) in the performing arts
referred to above, designed specifically for their participa-
tion, education, and recreation.

“In America, man’s whole culture reflects the dynamic,
diversified creativity made possible by a free democratic
society,” said Arthur S. Flemming, chairman of the board
of trustees and secretary of the US. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, in presenting to the public the ini-
tial plans and drawings of the Center, after their approval in
November 1959. “The increased leisure time is of great
importance to the peace of mind and the happiness of free
man. He is able to turn, more and more, to the restorativc
and creative values of the performing arts.

“Washington is the symbolic city. It is; democracy’s
‘showcase’ for a world audience. Here, in the capital of the
United States of America, our way of life is ‘on stage,3 front

and center, each and every day of the year for all the world
to see, measure, and evaluate.

“The completed cultural center will be a new symbol of

America’s greatness . . . a true, national home for the per-
forming arts . . . to delight and honor each of its 177,000,000
American owners . . . . With its completion, the federal city
will be what the founding fathers envisioned so long ago—a
cultural as well as a civic center.”

Located on a beautiful ten-acre site on the north bank
of the Potomac not far from the Lincoln Memorial,* the
Center will be a large, white, monumental building set in a
green park of trees, flowers, and grass. The Center’s archi-
tect, Edward Durrell Stone of New York, describes it as a
building which will “represent twenty-five hundred years of
Western culture, rather than twenty-five years of modern
architecture.”

By designing the opera house, the concert or symphony
hall, the playhouse or theater, and the two auditoriums of
the Center to be under one roof, with adequate and con-
venient space for parking cars and entering and leaving the
facilities, Mr. Stone has created a great hall with a dome-
like ceiling, to be known as the Grand Salon. It will open
up directly onto two terraces overlooking the Potomac. The
first terrace, adjoining the Grand Salon, will provide a cov-
ered area for dining and serving of refreshments. This
covered terrace will connect by gracious stairways to a
lower open-air terrace overlooking two lighted fountains.

The Grand Salon itself will enhance the Center by pro-
viding a reception and ballroom that may be used on official
and special occasions, such as presidential balls and great
formal receptions. This facility can seat as many as six
thousand persons.

With its regal staircase entrance opening on the Grand
Salon, the opera house will provide a majestic and beauti-
ful setting for full-scale performance of the great operas of
the world. Seating thirty-five hundred to four thousand
persons, the opera house will place our nation’s capital in
the forefront of American cities which present grand opera.
Stage, lighting, acoustic, and technical facilities will be of
the latest design and will make possible complete and flaw-
less productions which can be broadcast on television and
radio and recorded on film, tape and record.

Located to the left of the opera house, with entrances
both from the Grand Salon and from the diagonal passage-
way leading to the New Hampshire Avenue Plaza, the con-
cert or symphony hall, seating three thousand, will provide
a proper setting for musical presentations. The great orches-
tras and artists of the world will present performances, as
will the renowned United States Marine Band and other
well-known bands. Many of the 1,142 symphony orchestras
in the United States, as well as the many other school and
community music organizations, will be brought to Washing-

resentatives on recrcation boards, commissions, councils,
and/or committees. The church will seek guidance from
local recreation departments and auxiliary recreation agen-
cies. The church’s recreation program will be integrated
with the total community program.

The church can offer its facilities and leadership in the
sponsorship and operation of recreation meetings, institutes,
workshops, and conferences. If, in the church’s judgment,
some forms of recreation in the community are unwise, it
should oppose them to assume wholesome practices and
make worthy substitutions of dcsirable recreational activi-
ties.

’Publie Recreation

Recreation is often sponsored and promoted through the
local, county, state, and federal government‘s. Over two
thousand cities and towns have inaugurath year-round,
public tax-supported recreation programs. Well over one
hundred and fifty county and regional agencies are render-
ing park and recreation serviccs. Through state depart-
ments of forestry, parks, fish and game commissions, and
highway commissions much has been done. Advisory help
can be gotten from state universities, state planning hoa rds,
and state extension recreation specialists.

The agencies of the fedcral government that provide rcc-
reation resources include the Cooperative Extension Scrv-

ice of the Department of Agriculture, National Park Service,
U. S. Forest Service, Fish and \Vildlife Service, Children’s
Bureau, U. S. Office of Education, Veterans Administration,
and the U. S. Public Health Service. Because of their struc-
ture, these agencies can give only partial attention to
recreation.

Since everyone, as a taxpayer, is a “member” of these
government-sponsored service organizations, one is entitled
to ask for and receive help. These organizations are eager

q.

to give what the public wants and demands. luspecially on

308

   
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
   
  

the local level, churches can benefit very much from becom
ing acquainted with public recreation officials, facilities
and programs. Other local governmental units such as th
school, welfare, and health departments often offer recrea
tion services.

Public Schools

During the school year, the public schools givc th
churches heavy competition for the children’s time and in
terests. This competition for time is often for the leisur
hours of these boys and girls and our youth. Schools hav
recognized their opportunities for education in the worth
use of leisure time, in some cases ahead of the churches
In many places the schools are operating community recrc
ation programs. Extra-school activities, such as art, craft,
music, camps, and adult education, are also planned in som
cases to serve the community in which the school is located

Churches realize that most school functions are desirahl
and should not necessarily bc considered as being in com
petition with church activities. The church must constantl
evaluate and decide whether it should do the same thing
the schools do and to what degree coopcration should b
expected from and/or given to the school.

Public school units are getting larger. With the emphasi
on consolidation, school communities are often getting It
be too wide for effective group fellowship, and thc tru
sensc of a community tends to be lost. Perhaps the churcl
as a smaller community unit can preserve its identity mor
easily in such a situation.

The church can oftcn get facilitics and leadership frou
the school. Many churchcs make use of school gymnasium
and other facilities to enlarge and enrich their program,
This word of caution, however: All church-sponsored ac
tivities away from the church should he clearly identific
as church activities and never dissociated from the church
since loyalty usually centers around the meeting place.

Commercial Recreation

People are ready and willing to pay for recreation. l’ro
fessional Sports, intcrscholastic contests, howling. golf
fishing, hunting, skiing, movies, thcatcrs. radio. lelcvision
facilities for tourists, symphonies, private camping, amuse

RECREATIO.

ment parks, and dance halls are only a part of the scope of
commercial recreation activities.

Encouragement should be given to commercial interests
in recreation to serve the public in any and every construc-
tive way. Through legislation, licensing, regulations, police
controls, trade controls, and censorship, the public (and
the church) can stimulate and control commercial recrea-
tion. The church owes it to its members to give guidance
in selectivity, be the types of recreation commercial, public,
or church sponsored.

Some churches have made good use of commercial recre-
ation facilities in their communities. A privately owned
swimming pool may be engaged for an evening. The roller-
skating rink can be reserved for an all-church skate. Private
campgrounds are rented for church retreats. A bowling
alley may be reserved a night for church use. In any use
of public or commercial facilities, their use should be ob-
tained “with no strings attached,” and the standards of the
church should be maintained.

Agency Recreation

Because agencies often provide certain facilities and, pri-
marily, leadership, they can often offer group recreation
opportunities. Another advantage in agency recreation is
their providing of activities in natural age groups. The
Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts, the Boys’ Clubs of
America, the Camp Fire Girls, the Young Men’s Christian
Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the
Grange and the 4-H Clubs are some of the national organ-
izations sponsoring recreational activities for both youth
and adults.

Many churches cooperate with and even sponsor clubs
and activities of the national agencies mentioned above. If
a church feels that it does not compromise in its ideals,
does not lose its identity in the program, and can furnish
church-sponsored and directed leadership, cooperation with
such programs can be very helpful. If a denominational
club program is in operation, however, the loyalty and
strength of the church should be directed first to it.

Another source of help is the National Recreation Asso-
ciation which offers consultation service, prepares and dis-
tributes many valuable publications, conducts leadership
training, offers special services in the various phases of
recreation, and publishes RECREATION, a monthly magazine.

Interehurcll Cooperation

It would be very difficult, even for the large church, to
conduct a completely successful program of recreation if
it disregarded programs carried out by other church and
religious groups in the same community. Possible dupli-
cation and competition should be evaluated. Many small
towns and rural communities are overchurched, making it
advantageous for financial and other reasons to cooperate

in one well-unified, church-centered recreation program.

Through the United Christian Youth Council in .your
community, the local CBYF Fellowship chairman is able
to help in presenting the interest of the church in inter-
church recreation events. The National Catholic Commu-
nity Servicei‘iand the National Jewish Welfare Board have
developed recreation programs that are worth being studied
by Protestant groups.

E. O. Harbin mentions several areas of cooperation
among churches:  They could promote recreation train-
ing courses in general and in specialized fields; (2) by
pooling resources, they could provide the best leadership
available; (3) they could promote city or connnunitywide
programs such as pageants, festivals, community sings, con-
certs, and athletic leagues; (4) they could provide teams
of recreation specialists to help local churches by assisting
them in planning and directing special recreation events;
and (5) the churches should cooperate with other agencies
in the community. If there are activities that are question-
able, the churches should register protest and seek a better
program.

If the church leaders are confused by the many agencies
and departments promoting recreation activities, think of
the confused pattern presented to their members. If boys
and girls are sent away from the church for their weekday
education and recreation, can they always be expected to
return on Sunday for their religious training? It is the
challenge of every church to cooperate in community rec-
reation projects, but it is also necessary to make the local
church seem important in the recreation life of every boy,
girl, youth, and adult. A positive recreation program must
be made evident by the church if it is to capture the inter-
ests of its members and hold them to Christian values.

NOTE: Much help for this section was obtained from
Recreation for Community Living, by participants in the
National Recreation Workshop sponsored by the Athletic
Institute.

B FOR THE ILL

AND HANDICAPPED

    

Harry D. Ed gren

COUNSELING or
motivating in-
dividuals t0 partic-
ipate in experiences
we know will bene-
fit them should be
a basic concern of
all professional rec-

 

reation workers, regardless of the set-
ting in which they function. By motiva-
tion is meant the ability to stimulate an
individual to action and to provide the
incentive to participation and perform-
ance.

The following quotations from two
good books will serve as an introduction
to such counseling. Dr. Carl Rogers1
states, “Effective counseling consists of
a definitely structurcd, permissive re-
lationship which allows the client to
gain an understanding of himself to a
degree which enables him to take posi-
tive steps in the light of his new orien-
tation.”

Further support of this concept that
it is the counselor’s task to aid the coun-
selee in self-understanding is found in
a book by Kenneth W. Hamilton.2 He
says, “. . . Counseling requires recog-
nition of the fact that information of
itself does not make decisions. Mcdical
histories and diagnoses, the results of
psychometric tests, occupational infor-
mation, and social histories are signifi-
cant only in terms of the person to
whom thcy relate. They are significant
only to the extent that he understands
them, accepts them, and is capable of
acting upon them. . . . He is thus mo-
tivated more basically to do. Counsel-

“The function of recreation counseling in rehabilitation

is that of helping the patient understand himself.”

RECREA TION CO UNSELING

“. . . It is through the growth in un-
derstanding which the counselee exper-
iences that he is enabled to utilize his
own resourccs, and the services made
available to him for the purpose of over-
coming his own handicap. Rehabilita-
tion services provide the facilities which
the client utilizes. Sometimes—no mat-
ter how much he wants to do SO—he
neither can nor will benefit from them
without the aid of counseling. It is
the strong impression of many, includ-
ing the writer, that the handicapped re-
ceive from counseling as much assist-
ance as from any other service they
receive.”

There is evident agreement that the
function of recreation counseling in the
rehabilitation process is that of helping
the patient to understand himself. What
then are the major prcmises of such
counseling?

0 Counseling should be an individual-
izcd, democratic proccss.

0 Counseling relationships are based
on understanding rather than on judg-
ing.

0 Only some bchavior, not all, is ame-
nable to it.

o The counselor will be accepted by
the patient only to the extent to which
the patient wishes.

o The counseling process must begin
with the patient where he is and as he is.

0 Individual differences among pa-
tients limit the process.

0 Limitations of community and pro-
gram further delimit it.

0 Professional recreation workers
should be motivated to learn more about
the individuals who comc undcr their
direction and who can profit by partici-
pating in their program. We all necd to
become more adept at understanding
“the language of behavior” as ex-
pressed by an individual’s rcsponsc or

lack of response. We are not psychol-
ogists or psychiatrists, but we have
learned through experience some meth-
ods and techniques that have been help-
ful in securing positive participation by
patlcnts.

The following are some personal con-
victions and some practices in recrea-
tion counseling which have emerged
from correspondence and conversations
with a number of professional hospital
recreation people in Indiana.

The leader must be acceptcd by the
patient. His approach is orie of cmpathy
rather than sympathy. He must be sin-
cerely interested in others and sold on
the value of the eXperience in which he
is inviting the patient to participate.

He starts with activities with which
the patient is familiar, and where the pa-
tient feels secure. He then moves to
less familiar activities.

He moves at a pace that gives partici-
pants an opportunity to experience
gradual success and feel the satisfaction
that comes from accomplishment. l'fe
establishes achievable goals, recogniz-
ing that if any activity is too detailed to
comprehend, or appears difficult, it will
rcsult in frustration or rapid rejection
on the patient's part.

The effective leadcr recognizes the
value of friendship as one of the real
motivators of participation—and ncw
experiences, both in and out of the hos-
pital sctting. Successful groups in our
socicty are those which have moved
from “interest” to “fricndship” groups.

Because the professional rccrcation
workcr in the hospital is concerned with
the patient's return to normal life in the
community, he uses community rc.
sources in his program. Hc rclates pa-
tients to groups in churchcs, lodgcs, and
public and voluntary agcncics. Ilc

WHY SOCCER?

Here are some good reasons for using this

variation of football in your young people’s sports program.

D. Y. Yonker

IT WOULD BE presumptuous to claim

advantages for one team sport over
another, and I have no intention of so
doing. In the first place, I do not be-
lieve this is so, but one activity might
be more appropriate in a particular situ-

tion than another.
First, soccer provides another activ-

i
l.
ity that youth can enjoy under the expert guidance of quali-
lied coaches. Roger Bannister, first of the under-four-min-
ute milers, said, “Adolescence is a time of conflict and
bewilderment. . . . Each of us has to find his sports activity
for himself. It may be mountain climbing. running or sail-
ing, or it may be something quite different. The important
thing is that we ourselves perform rather than watch

others. . . .”

 

MR. YONKER is editor of the Soccer Journal, 9-19 ll elling-
ton Road, Philadelphia 1?, Pennsylvania.

Second, soccer has inherent physical values. The run-
ning involved, not the intense, tension-packed type of com-
petition sprinting, develops endurance and organic vigor,
and, because of the sustained character of the playing pe-
riods of the game, also develops a degree of total body con-
ditioning not often found in other team sports. Third,
coupled with this endurance factor, soccer demands the per-
former develop unusual individual techniques with the feet
and head. Fourth, a soccer team has no specialists. and
thus engenders a spirit of unity and cooperation easily rec-
ognized by the player and achieved by the coach. Each
player can, momentarily. by the run of the ball. become
leader of his team, master of the situation. faced with a
problem which will be valuable in its solving. or in its fail
ure to be solx ed.

The next point concerns the number of players that can
be accoi'nmodated. both as regards organization of a single
team and space reuplirenn-nls. i‘llllstillllitill should h. 1111

above, playing requirements are basically the same for all
positions, so players ean be readily interehanged on the
field. Played on fields of redueed size, where portable goals
can usually transform a football field into three soeeer play-
ing areas, soeeer permits as many as sixty-six youngsters
to play simultaneously. With substitution, the sky is the
limit dUring team tournaments.

Team movements, both offensive and defensive, are di-
rectly comparable to basketball, with whieh every Ameri-
can boy has at least passing acquaintanee. He defends by
playing man-to-man against his opposite number on the
other team; he moves the ball on offense in a pattern of
simple passes from teammate to teammate; seores by put-
ting the ball into a target area, the opposition’s goal. Soceer
rules are among the easiest to master. The basie tenets are:
Play to the ball, not the man; do not use hands or arms to
manipulate and control the ball; and do not foul delib-
erately.

And the cost? A youngsters’ soeeer team ean he outfitted
with as little as a gym suit and sneakers if you ean just
afford essentials. Up to twelve years of age, boys should
use a volleyball for play; after that, for another two years,
a junior-size soeeer ball. Thereafter, he will be able to per-
form with a ball of regulation size and weight.

Do give him a eolored jersey, please, and provide him
with a number front and back for the glamour angle, and
he will develop a sense of belonging to something more
particularized than just the ordinary gym-suit group. A
good eanvas-topped, eleated shoe is desirable, and will elim-
inate toe kicks.

Hang goal nets on his reduced-size goals so he may ex-
perience the thrill of having a low, hard one swish against
the back of the net like his older brother, and because. too,
it’s a proper appurtenanee of the game. Outfit him with shin
guards; they cost less than a dollar a pair.

And, last of all, don’t expeet to pay out money for in-
juries, although your hoys may lose an oceasional toenail

from constant aetion of the ball against his big toe, or get
a seraped knee in a desperate attempt to gain baek a ball
from an opponent. He might possibly even sprain his ankle.
Soccer’s safety record has been extremely good, even at
the rough, bustling college level.

At least five Eastern cities and one in the Midwest are
working out worthwhile youth soeeer programs. In Balti-
more, Maryland, Dr. Donald Minnegan, athletie director at
Towson Teaehers College, stages an annual elinie and tourn-
ament for pre-high-sehool boys in eonjunetion with the city
recreation department. In Philadelphia, all junior soccer
has been placed under the department of reereation, while
in Ithaca, New York, Jackson Hall, of the city recreation
administration, is planning a large-seale youth soecer pro-
gram.

Two summers ago, Irv Schmid, Springfield College coach,
spearheaded a program of TV showings, elinies, and youth
tournaments that continued into the fall for the youth of
that Massachusetts eity. Dale Harper. high-sehool coach,
and lioy Dath, Trinity College eoaeh, have oflered similar
leadership in Hartford, Conneetieut.

One of the largest youth soeeer programs in operation is
that of the Catholic Youth Council in St. Louis, Missouri.
With a staggering total of 350 teams in seven age elassifiea-
tions, more than fifty-four hundred lads play organized
soeeer under proper leadership. This program is headed
by an outstanding eoaeh, Bob Guelker, whose St. Louis
University Billikens won the 1959 National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association tournament, and were adjudged the num-
ber-one eollege team in the nation.

in closing, it is noteworthy that soeeer was required in
the program of every air cadet in the U. S. Naval Flight
Ollieers Training Program during World War II. We owe
our youngsters in America a complete program of sports.
to give impetus to our slogans for fitness, to aehieve the
healthy aim, and, most important, to provide direction to

young people during that dillicult period of adolescence.

Spring Lake Beach,
{New Jersey, I recalled the days when
:I had walked three miles to an ice
'pond, shoveled off the snow, built a
fire to keep warm with my chums,
skated many hours, and played one
game of ice hockey after another. In
Spring Lake Beach, with its mild
winters, there was little or no oppor-
tunity for ice skating or ice hockey. It
was then that I decided to try to think of
a game which would have the elements
of ice hockey, without the ice, and yet
be an active game for youngsters.

My maintenance man built a wooden
box which I designed out of boards. I
purchased two ice hockey sticks and a
“nickel rocket” baseball for the first

game between two boys of elementary-
school age. Children loved to play the
game. Over the years, my maintenancc
mcn and I tried to improve the ball, the
sticks, and the box. When I was em-
ployed in Reading, Pennsylvania, my
maintenance crew tried to make balls
out of sawdust and glue which neVer
turned out too satisfactorily. The ice-
hockey sticks, purchased commercially,
never stood up under the terrific battle
of the kids and were constantly broken.
Even the box which was originally de-
signed took such a beating that it often
broke in many places. However, the
game is now made of sturdy and dura-
ble hickory.

The game and I finally migrated to
Tacoma, Washington, where I have
stayed put. The game has traveled on,
spreading rapidly to summer play-
grounds throughout America. Today,
foreign exchangees who have visited
Tacoma have taken it to the four cor-
ners of the world.

This active game, played by two
players, requires about a twenty-seven-
foot space, and may be played indoors
or out. The play begins with the ball
in the cradle, and each player attempts
to dislodge it from there, and hit it
through his opponent’s opening, while
preventing his opponent from scoring
through his own Opening. The first
player to accomplish this is declared
the winner. Hockey sticks may never

be lifted highcr than the edge of the
box, put through either hole to block
the ball, or held outside the box to
keep the ball from coming through;
and, of course, striking an opponent
is forbiddcn. If any of these fouls is
committed, the opponent is granted
one free trial for a point by placing
the ball in the cradle, and attempting
to knock it through his opponent’s goal.
There are also variations on this game,
and it can be played with doubles, or
as “golf box hockey,” where the players
alternate their strokes.

A Plea
for

Handball

A RECENT Athletic Institute report

on total participation in various
sports in the United States gives an es-
timate of 6,714,000 tennis players and
5,000,000 golfers. The institute has also
found that participation in various
sports has increased in the past ten
years; for example, tennis, sixty per-

SEPTEMBER 1960

cent; baseball, forty-two percent. In
contrast, a National Collegiate Athletic
Association study shows that of 395
colleges included in a survey, only fifty-
four percent have handball courts. De-
spite the lack of courts, handball
ranked twelfth in popularity and elev-
enth in number of participants in col-
lege intramurals.

Handball is an excellent activity to
achieve complete physical fitness. The
handball player uses virtually every
musclc in his body as he runs. lunges,
bends, twists, and jumps. Since the ball
can be hit from almost any position

with either hand, handball is a diflicult,
fast game.

Handball requirements are simple.
In the United States, the game is played
both indoors and out, on a rectangular
court 40'-by-25’-by-20'. The indoor
game is played off the four walls and
the ceiling, very much like squash rack-
ets; the outdoor game, off one wall.
Each has a national championship.

Can recreation programs be more mobile?

MANY OF THE factors affecting all types of com-
munity services, which have a very definite
bearing on recreation, were discussed at the recent
White House Conference on Children and Youth.
Many are exerting, and will exert, increasing pres-

sures on the services of recreation agencies.
It has become imperalive for such agencies to con-

 

sider seriously not only how to maintain present
services, but expand them to meet new demands and needs. Some de-
partments are already experiencing the paradox of increased demand for
services coupled with a growing resistance in providing the. tax or con-
tributed dollar. Any method of giving increased flexibility to programs
and leadership should therefore be explored. The use of mobile units
may be one.

Mobile units, especially of the. play mobile and the slum-wagon type,
are. not new. RECREATION has carried many articles about specific ones
in we [see list of references at end of article}. In the past. however.
some were very makeshift, and their effectiw use. was hampered by
dilliculties in assembling them, lack of loudspeaker systems, poner gen-

From the information received, several interesting trends v, i
become apparent. First, departments with show wagons and -
bandstands or shells are finding multiple uses for them. In
several instances, units designed and manufactured com-
mercially are in use, or are being considered.

Show wagons and mobile bandstands are by far the most
prevalent, eighteen departments reporting the former, and
nine the latter. No one reported a traveling trading post;
only two reported a zoomobile; one reported a hobbymo-
bile, no longer in use owing to faulty construction; three

. . . of Recreation Facilities

Martin N. Thomas

IN ANY consideration of maintenance
of recreation facilities, the subject of
basic design will certainly emerge as the
chief controlling factor. With this in
mind, let us consider this important
point before entering into any detailed
account of maintenance methods. All
recreation facilities serve certain defi-
nite purposes, and every effort should be made to design
each facility so all of these will be met.

All recreation facilities are subject to depreciation
through use, misuse, age, and the elements. Therefore. the
design of any facility should take into account all factors
having a bearing upon its life and full utilization. Even
with the best planning, maintenance problems will arise that
can be solved only through the exercise of a considerable
amount of ingenuity.

Most of us have seen baseball and softball fields unusable
for long periods following rain because of puddles around

the bases; and many of us have seen attempts to correct
this condition at the last minute in order to maintain a league
schedule. Sand is spread on the wet areas; gasoline is poured
on the field and set afire; the game goes on under adverse
conditions; and everybody is unhappy. This operation is
repeated several times a season, over a period of years, at
considerable cost and dislocation of scheduled programs.

Very likely proper design could have minimized this sit-
uation before the field was established. If the area was
considered suitable for a ballfield in the first place, it follows
that the grading required to provide proper drainage Would
not have been very great. Even on fairly level areas it is
possible to provide drainage away from the infield. Ute-r
grading, incorporate sand into the top six inches of the in-
field and base paths in amounts sufhcient to prexent muddy
conditions or crusting of the surface when it dries. Such
construction appears expensive at the moment. but. over a
period of years, 111aintenance cost will be much less than that
of an ungraded field; even more important. more games may
be scheduled.

I believe all administrntors of recreation programs will

319

@ADMINISTRATION

 

agree it is essential that responsihility for maintenance of
all facilities be delegated to one person. This person should
be familiar with construction, operation, and maintenance
of all facilities under his jurisdiction. Of equal importance
is insuring that the persons responsihle for maintenance and
for program arrangement understand each other’s problems
and that they cooperate fully.

Any maintenance program should have a regular schedule
that will least interfere with use of facilities. Such an ar-
rangement requires that the supervisor of maintenance and
the program supervisors keep one another informed of their
respective activities. It is not uncommon for the mainte-
nance crew to find a game in progress when it arrives at a
ballfield to drag the infield or to mow the outfield. By the
same token it is not uncommon for program directors to find
that maintenance has entered the area just prior to the sched-
uled time for a game. Or, again, maintenance may exert
every effort to place a field in perfect condition only to find
the game has heen postponed. On the other hand, the teams
may arrive for a scheduled game only to find a rough infield,
unmarked base lines, and the outfield a jungle.

Such situations have let loose many harsh words and
much steam, but we should resign ourselves to the fact that
this will he standard operating procedure as long as main-
ten ance supervisor and program supervisor fail to cooperate.
Also, such coopcration will be difficult to achieve as long as
the respective supervisors are under different administratch
authorities.

One important phase of maintenance, often overlooked,
is housekeeping. The influence of any rccreation program
extends beyond the participants in its activities. Spectators
as well as casual onlookers are impressed, favorably or un-
favorably, by the general appearance of a recreation area;
therefore, neatness and order are prime requirements. it is
a maintenance axiom that well-maintained facilities do not
receive the abuse neglected facilities do. People hesitate to
mistreat clean, neat, and orderly facilities, whereas an ill-
kept and dilapidated facility invites abuse.

No recreation program can operate efficiently unless an
adequate sum is allocated for maintenance. In many in-
stances, all available funds are allocated for facilities and
programs, with no thought of maintenance, or in hopes that
funds for maintenance will be available at some later date.
No community can afford to provide more facilities than it
can maintain properly, yet that situation exists in many. The
tax-paying public is likely to be more critical of poorly main-
taincd facilities than of inadequate programs.

Since most recreation facilities are used in connection
with seasonal activities, it is a common practice to terminate
maintenance at the end of the period of intensive use. With
the resumption of use, thcre is a frantic last-minute effort
to get everything ready. It is very difficult to hire compe-
tcnt labor on a seasonal basis, and, unless the recreation
program is very limited, it is highly desirable that a year-
round maintenance force be employed. in small communi-
ties this may he a one-man operation during the winter

320

months. With proper planning, all outdoor equipment can

be overhauled then, with the result that very little mainte-

nance will he required during the time of heaviest use.
Following is a list of items that can be reconditioned to

good advantage during the winter or off season.

Power equipment. Tractors, trucks, lawn mowers, pumps,

etcetera.

Pfayground apparatus. Picnic tables, stoves, lighting equip-

ment, benches, bleachers, etcetera.

Goff equipment. Tee markers, flags, ball washers, signs, and

so on.

Sports. Fields, fences, backstops, etcetera.

Swimming pool equipment. Pumps, chlorinators, valves,

fences, floats, signs, checking facilities, diving boards, et-

cetera. Immediately upon closing the pools, all filters and

circulating lines should be drained. Buildings and dressing

rooms should be repaired and painted if necessary. Early

autumn is a much better time for this work than late spring.

he average taxpayer is not interested in the amount

that you pay for fertiiizers, grass seed, and stationery:
he is interested in the cost of the operation of your gotf
course, your beaches, your zoo, and your conservatory.
The necessity for keeping records so as to express these
costs honest! y and intettigentty cannot be overemphasized.
—GEORGE B. CASKEY, superintendent of parks, Win-
netka, Illinois.

 

During periods of intensive use, all facilities rcquire con-
stant attention in order to realize their full worth. All turf
arcas must be mowed regularly. Ballficlds and clay tennis
courts must he dragged and marked frequently. Picnic areas
require special attention. Tables must be washed every day
and, often, more. Refuse containers can become very offen-
sive during hot weather and must be emptied and washed
frequently. Fly sprays should be used regularly. All litter
and any food particles must be picked up, also tin cans.

Every community has a vandalism problem. and l know
of no mcthod of eliminating this drain upon maintenance
funds. Vandalism can be decreased by the immediate re-
moval or replacement of the damaged article. For instance,
if a window is broken and not replaced immediately, it is
quite likely that a rash of broken windows will develop;
whereas, if the glass is replaced immediately, there is little
likelihood of other windows being broken unless someone is
dedicated to the idea of total destruction. Occasionally
someone will dump a qnantity of tin cans and refuse in a
recreation area. If this is not picked up immediately, the
area will soon resemble the city dump.

Buildings present a particular problem in thc mainte-
nance program. If they are in constant Use. ordinary wear
and tear will makc frchent repairs necessary. Frequent
painting is a must, and areas, such as gymnasium floors.
require a great amount of care. The type of programs con-
ducted in buildings and the charactcr of the supervision
under which they are conducted will have a markcd effect

upon the amount and type of maintenance required. lso-

PKEEP is “the process of keeping
U up or maintaining; the main-

tenance, or keeping in opera—
tion, due condition, and repair, of an
establishment, a machine, etc.,” accord-
ing to the American College Diction-
ary. The “etc.” permits us to expand
the definition to include recreation
buildings and areas, equipment, sap-
plies, and all other property with which
recreation and park workers are con-

cerned.

This column is an answer to the need
expressed by readers of RECREATION for
more information concerning upkeep. It
is intended as an exchange—of hints
and suggestions on upkeep and a dis-
cussion on the wide range of ingenious
.ideas that park and recreation depart-
:ments have developed. How long the
Icolumn continues depends upon the in-
terest shown, and, particularly, upon
our readers” willingness to share their
practical ideas, to ask and answer ques-
tions, and to provide material.

Martin Thomas, superintendent of
parks in St. Joseph, Missouri, in an ar-
ticle on Page 319 of this issue, points
out that “even with the best of planning,
maintenance problems will arise that
can be solved only through the exercise

f a considerable amount of ingenuity.”
IEveryday, somewhere, someone is exer-
icising his ingenuity in figuring how to
naintain, keep in condition, or repair
omething as simply, cheaply, and effec-
ively as possible; someone is solving

maintenance problem baffling some-
ne else.

This assertion is confirmed by the
ips on upkeep—tried and tested—by
nother man from Missouri, Bill Lyon,
uperintendent of parks and recreation
'n Marshall. Bill has developed a park
_yste1n regarded highly by the people of

Marshall and the surrounding area, and
it is visited frequently by citizens of
other communities interested in devel-
oping or improving their own parks.
Bill has found out how to keep up his
facilities at minimum cost; he experi-
ments; he makes good use of what he
has to work with. Here are a few sam-
ples:

1. We made a very convenient repair
table out of the base of a barber chair.
We removed the seat and put a 24”-by-
36” table top on it. The lift works off
the air hose. The table can be raised or
lowered and turned around to get to all
sides of a repair job.

2. We have a spring-fed lake that is
excellent fishing, except for a plague of
moss growing in it. We have tried to
remove or eliminate the moss in many
ways without success. We attached a
hay rake, upside down, at the bow of a
boat. As the boat moves through the
water, propelled by poles, the rake
catches up the moss. At the bank the
rake is lifted, the moss removed with a
pitchfork, and taken away.

3. Golf is a very important part of
our recreation program. All children
play free and enjoy free lessons. We
built a permanent driving cage, using a
wire frame with a canvas backdrop. We
keep a box of used golf balls for the
youngsters. Whenever anyone finds a
ball with no name on it, he puts it in this
box. Since the children know they can
use these anytime, they readily turn in
any balls found on the course.

4. Sandboxes in the play area should
have corrugated tin bottoms. Wooden
bottoms soon rot and need replacing.
The wooden sides are made of boards
used for stair treads, giving a smooth
round edge. Painting, of course, pre-
serves the wood and lengthens the life
of the box. Placing small boxes, about
3’-by-3’, on eight-inch cement legs, al-
lows adequate drainage. Sand should
be clean, free of sharp particles, such as
glass, and should be changed every two

or three years. The dirty sand can be
used as a fill in low places, or put to
othcr uses.

We have had considerable success
with several sizes of sandboxes. One
is a large one, 12’-l)y-24«’, constructed
of cement blocks. This is fine for group
play or large proiccts. The 3’-by-3’s
are just right for smaller children.

5. We have devised a very convenient
way of storing playground equipment
at the close of each day—a large water-
tight steel cabinet on wheels, that can
be pushed out to the playground each
morning and returned to the shelter
house each evening. Inside are racks,
hooks, boxes, bins, etcetera to hold all
balls, bats, rackets, and other equip-
ment. The playground instructor can
check out the equipment without leav-
ing the playground. By having a place
for each piece, she can tell at a glance if
everything has been checked in.

6. Two common sources of trouble
for leather goods, such as balls, shoes,
and other items, are high temperature
and excessive moisture. As a result of
either, mold rot can form on the leather,
attacking both leather and stitching. To
prevent this, leather equipment should
be stored in a cool, dry place. When
leather gets wet, it should be dried im-
mediately, normal room temperature
being better than any kind of artificial
heat. Saddle soap cleans and helps pre-
vent harshness; dry—cleaning fluid
should never be used.

Inflated balls should be stored and in-

flated, but at reduced pressure in a cool
place. Never fold or crush them. If pos-
sible, they should be stored so there is
free air circulation. When inflating,
always moisten the needle, preferably
with glycerin. A pressure gauge should
be used, for overinflation causes strain
and lessens the life of the ball.

7. A quick way to paint pipe is to
turn a pair of fleece-lined plastic gloves
wrong side out, then dip into paint and
rub hands down the pipe.

Thanks to Bill Lyon for these hints.
Do they suggest any others that you
have tried and found practicable? Do
they raise any questions you would like
to ask? We will be glad to print your
questions, and invite readers to supply
answers. We would like to hear from
you. Help us keep up “Conccrning [lip-

An Immediate Problem

The Park, Recreation and Open Space Project of the New
Jersey-New York-Connecticut metropolitan region was set
up to help meet the growing need for open space in the
twenty-two-county region by providing necessary data and
developing recommendations which will be useful to gov-
ernment and other agencics having responsibility for ac-
quisition and preservation of parks and other open land.
The project is a joint effort of public officials and civic or-
ganizations. Its sponsors are the Metropolitan Regional
Council and the Regional Plan Association. The project has
had the advice and assistance of the MetrOpolitan Council
of Planning Agencies, the National Recreation Association,
and the National Audubon Society. Project manager is
Stanley B. Tankel, RPA senior planner. This study will be
discussed during the 42nd National Recreation Congress
session on research techniques.

Three of the project’s series of four publications have
already appeared.* The first, The Law of Open Space, by
Shirlcy Adelson Siegel, covers legal aspects of acquiring
or preserving open space. Mrs. Siegcl was recently named
assistant attorney general of the State of New York. The
report makes the following recommendations:

0 The states of Ncw Jersey, New York, and Connecticut
should follow the lead of California which, in 1959, cnacted
a law empowering municipalities to acquire land as open
Spacc designed to enhance the value of surrounding urban
development. This far cxceeds the usual powcrs to acquirc
parks to preserve scenic values.

0 The three states should give serious consideration to es-
tablishing a sclf-liquidating land acquisition agcncy to 0p-
eratc in the path of urban growth, just as urban renewal
agcncics operate now in the heart of urban congestion or
decay. The three state agencies would acquire largc parcels
of land, plan their use, sell to private entcrprisc those areas
most suitable for development and rcserve areas for parks
and other public needs. Thc three states should enact leg-
islation to authorize multiple usc of reservoir lands and
forest lands.

*9 County and local officials should make greater use of
the variety of existing powers to keep land open. These
include: excess condemnation, scenic easements, transfers
of private land by gift and public land between agencies,
tax lien foreclosure, advance acquisition of parklands in
anticipation of future needs, property-tax and income-tax
policies, and zoning of flood plains," wetlands, designated
scenic areas and rocky lands against development.

The second report, entitled The Dynamics of Park De-
mand, was prepared by Dr. Marion Clawson of Resources
for the Future. Dr. Clawson notes that there will be a sub
stantial rise over the next quarter century in each of the
factors which most affect the demand for recreation: pop-
ulation, per capita income, leisure time, and ease of travel.

The third report, Nature in the Metropolis, was prepared
by Dr. William A. Niering, ecologist and associate professo
of botany at Connecticut College. It urges immediate ac-
tion to save two hundred and twenty square miles of pres-
ently undeveloped land in the tristate New York metropol-
itan rcgion. Dr. Niering states, “Nature is more varied in
the New York region than in any other metropolitan area
of the country. The need to preserve this great natural

tection of wildlife, flood prevention, and water supply in
this area.

Dr. Niering stressed that “participation in such natural
area activities as hiking, bird-watching, hunting, fishing.
camping, and boating is outstripping p0pulation gains by
far. This fact is borne out by the stcady increases in at-
tendance records, equipment sales, licenses issucd. and by
merc observation. . . .

“Conservation is not often associatcd with the built-up
parts of our nation,” says Dr. Nicrinw, “yet in this era 0
unbridled metropolitan expansion, it has become a critical
urban problem. Within this grcat urban region are the mos
powcrful and impressive examples of man’s ability t
alter the natural environmcnt. Skyscrapcrs, cXpressways
bridges, aqueducts, canals, dams—thcse represent what ma
has carved out for himsclf from the raw materials whicl
nature provides. But we . . . find ourselves the victims 0
our own accomplishments. Duc to man’s ineptitude, wate
and air often become pollutcd, floods run rampant, and th
food supply itself is threateucd. But, pcrhaps most impor
tant of all, man’s carelessness with nature destroys thc best\*

form of relief he has from the tensions of urban life.”
The Niering report received vigorous endorsemcnt by

county and town officials in Bcrgen County (N. 1.). Nassau.
Suffolk. and Westehester Counties (N. Y.), and liairfield
County (Comm). Commenth Hugh R. Pomcroy, directo
of planning in \Vestchcstcr, “l fcel that the preservation
of open space is the most important single problem that we
face today in the physical (levclopmcnt of communities. It

   
   
  
  

is more important even than building new highways. If a

New Dimension to an Old Concept

In his final report as superintendent of the Minneapolis
Board of Park Commissioners, Charles Doell commented
on changes that have occurred in park service since the
beginning of the century. He pointed out that “recreation
has added a new dimension . . . to the old concept of parks
being islands of peace and quiet . . . in contrast to the con-
fused stream of city life surrounding these islands.” Com-
menting on the growing establishment of neighborhood
parks, he noted that, in several instances, these were built
and integrated with school facilities and devoted to active
recreation for people of all ages. The horticultural adorn-
ment of these areas is kept at a minimum, in view of the
wear and tear of today’s extensive recreation use.

“Even large park areas are experiencing more active use
and far greater attendance than they were ever intended to
provide at the time of their original designation. For in-
stance, at our Minneapolis lakes in bygone years, crowds
were expected to attend the designated bathing beacheS.
Today, the grass areas circumscribing these lakes are almost
completely occupied by individuals sunbathing and groups
of informal picnickers. The added population within the
city, plus the fact that the development of parks in suburban
communities has not kept pace with the increase in popula-
tion, has placed increasing burdens on our city parks.

“It is now no longer possible to maintain all our parks
as landscaped areas. . . . Today the concept of design as well
as the actual accommodation of people is influenced prin-
cipally by the needs and demands for active recreation. We
find that many of our larger parks are in need of recon-
struction to conform with the modern demands of traffic

and recreation use.”

Greenbelt Communities

A general plan report for South Santa Clara County,
California, From Roadside Towns to Greenbelt Cities, pre-
sents a proposal for the deve10pment of a valley only lightly
touched by the hands of man and devoted primarily to
orchards and agricultural uses. Recreation is stressed.

The plan proposes a system of local and regional parks,
connected by trailwaysiand recreation roads, with allowance
for ample recreation space as neighborhoods develop. For
the year 2000 it envisions a “greenbelt” city of some 275,000
pe0ple living in six communities, each with a distinct char-
acter. Separating them, and limiting their ultimate growth,
would be a greenbelt comprising 35,000 acres of agricul-
tural land. A civic and cultural center between two of the
towns would include city and county offices, a junior college
of university, a regional shopping center, and a park with
stadium, gymnasium, outdoor theater, auditorium, play-
.field, and wooded picnic area. The typical neighborhood

would be developed around the school and neighborhood
park, grouped as a grecnbelt of public open space. Easily
accessible to the whole neighborhood by pedestrian walk-
ways, a green common fosters social cohesion often lacking

in the ordinary subdivision.

can become a nightmare to haunt each
professional recreation worker since it
means that only a small fraction, or one-
sixth, of the thirty thousand recreation
vacancies expected by 1970, because of
turnover and newly created jobs, will
be filled unless they are filled by un-
qualified people. That is what we have
to look forward to if recruiting efforts
do not become more effective and morc
recreation students are not graduated.

The National Recreation Associa-
tion’s National Advisory Committee’s
student inventory (see table) indicated
that the profession is barely holding
the line. Although the number of rec-
reation graduates reported for 1.960
(598) is slightly higher than the pre-
ceding year, it is still below 1958 and
the high mark of 1951 (692). With

from 207 students last year to 172 in
1960. The Middle Atlantic remained
about the same as last year while the

Recruiting must be a personal mis-
sion, and the advisory committee urges
each professional worker to make a
solemn compact with hin1sclf to:

0 Provide guidance counselors and
school principals with recreation career
information. Don’t send it—takc it and
get acquainted with them personally.
0 Counsel the young people participat-

sitions, not just about your own job.

RECREATION "

DIGEST

Robert Moses, Chairman, New York State Council of Parks

 

In the words of this well-known and experienced park man,

“There is no time left for debate.”

N behalf of the state park com-
0 missions, the city of New York,
and the numerous municipal
agencies with which we cooperate, I
welcome the opportunity to emphasize
the critical needs of the state and metro-
politan park systems for immediate ac-
quisition of fast-disappearing open
lands.

We do plan ahead in these agencies.
By inclination, by long, and, I may
claim, productive experience, we have
acted to establish a recreation system
second to none, but still inadequate.
We must now proceed pragmatically,
first things first, with a limited, specific.
and understandable program, to meet
the challcnge of the rapid disappearancc
of natural areas and minute subdivi-
sion by real-estate developers and pro-

able for future park use. rnust be ac-
quired right now without delay or fatal
postponement (all italics ours) .

There is no cheap easy solution. No
one is going to stop the continuing con-
centration of urban and suburban popu-
lation. There can be better control and
regulation, but there is no substitute for
public ownership of strategic and basic
recreational lands. “illile artistic ren-

complete with circumferential belts of
green. come off the presses in steady
succession without follow-up or realiza-
tion, the developers of subdivisions and

shepping centers are cutting 11p and
loading the last available acres of open
land with costly improvements.

Time has run out on academic plan-
ning of this sort. Willen all the land re-
maining for recreation is gone, formulas
based on people per acre will be futile.
Precise mathematical classification of
land for best use and hair-splitting nice-
ties to govern selections are folly at this
stage. There is no time left for debate.

ligent fm'ethought and common sense.

and dedications of land can help, but
most of the needed land must be ob-
tained by purchase or condemnation.
There must be realization of the fact
that costs will be high in some cases.
The open land most urgently needed and
most rapidly disappearing is in and
near cities and inevitably subject to
booms and urban values.

The required speed and cost are such
that ordinary annual appropriations
cannot possibly do the job at any level
of government, state or local. Further-
more, we must recognize that the cost of

needed land in municipalities is beyond
their capacity without substantial assis-
tance from the state.

Legislation recommended . . . to meet
these realities . . . defines where the state
alone shall act and tethere the state shall
aid municipalities, and . . . provides
high standards and proper channels of
approval to insure control.

How to Attend a Meeting

Useful do’s and don’ts for Congress delegates . . .

ERSONS will bring away from a
P meeting different reactions and

learnings, depending on how ef-
fectively they prepared for it, became
involved in it, and rclatcd it to their
back-home job. Attitudes makc a dif-
ference.

People react to meetings in various
ways. Some people attending can be
compared to tourists. They regard thc
experience as a wonderful trip. They
journey to a new place and mect new
people, but go back to their jobs saying,
“Now I am back on the mainland: that
‘Meeting Island’ was unreal and unre-
lated to my own job.”

Other participants have what might
be described as the eXpatriate rcsponse.
They become so enthusiastic they feel
that the meeting is the real place to en-
joy life, and that work back homc is
mere drudgery and unreality.

It is to be hoped that most of us will
rcspond like the “situation-ccntered
tourist,” who has discovcred rcal com-
patibilities between the land he visits
and his own country, and also some in-
compatibilities and some areas that need
further exploration.

When he goes to a meeting, snch a
pcrson does not plan to swallow it
whole. He knows that the best way to
get a fair estimate of the mccting’s valnc
to him is to ask himself meaningful

328

questions after he is back on thc job
one, thrce, or even six months later.

If a participant keeps the following
things in mind, he can profit greatly.
Preparing for the Meeting
Do . .

Analyze the reasons why yon want to
go to thc mccting and try to appraisc
honestly your ability to benefit from it
in your job.

licad as much as you can about the
location in which your Inccting will be
hcld.

Dos’r . . .

Go without adcqnate preparation.

Put off until thc last minute any spe-
cial assignments requested of you by
the program committee.

Forget to makc your room and ronnd-
trip travel rescrvations and to obtain
confirmation of them.

Arriving at the Meeting
Do . . .

Register and make any neccssary rcs-
ervations for dinner or other social
functions.

Become familiar with the physical ar-
rangcments and rcview dctails of the
program.

DON’T . . .

Eat or tour alone if you can use these
opportunitics to bccome acquainted
with pcrsons from othcr parts of thc
country.

years. It is now critical. Acquisition
of other important conservation areas
somewhat more distant from the cities
is also provided by this proposition.

This entire program represents high-
ly intelligent, progressive government
thinking. New York is taking the lead
and other states will follow. We are
also furnishing the finest possible aid
to the Outdoor Recreation Resources
Review Commission, which is prepar-
ing a continental program. ...,.

MONDAY P. M.: Mrs. Ellis calls out the cadence
for calisthenics. It's a large and widespread group.
Again, loud and clear. No strain on her voice.

MONDAY, still PM.: Assembly—popular music helps
soothe excitable youngsters pouring into the
auditorium. Announcements; neophyte entertainers;
Mr. Stanley, the principal, gives a speech.

MONDAY NIGHT: Same Califone, now playing

! music and “calling” to an adult square dance group.

TUESDAY A. M.: (In a note from the Principal to
the Board of Education) Please make provision in
our budget for an additional Califone

PROMENADE as well as a Califone COMMANDER
(62V). We have immediate need for these.

The COMMANDER will be particularly useful for
announcing games to forthcoming
basketball audiences.

Reereation—l985

A small group of recreation execu-
tives attended a “Crystal Ball” session
in White Plains, New York, on April
21, at the invitation of White Plains
recreation commissioner Joe Curtis.
The National Recreation Association
was represented by assistant executive
director Art Williams. The mccting’s
purpose was discussion of what recrea-
tion might be like in 1985; the method:
brainstorming, thc tcclmiquc often used
by advertising, business. and industrial
firms to get fresh ideas. The following

330

are some ideas that rose to thc tOp:

0 We overemphasize program, under-
emphasizc philosophy and long-range
plans.

0 \Vc need equipment libraries—some
place where every conceivable form of
recreation equipment can be borrowed,
as from a public library. This means
boats, camping gear, sports equipment,
and other items. The recreation depart-
ment could well provide this serviee.

o The local recreation executive must
raise his own status in the eyes of his
local public, through stricter certifica-

NOTEBOOK

tion and broadening the scope of in-
struction for recreation administrators.
Included in this must he courses in
training and communications.

0 Atomic energy will provide low-cost
night lighting, which may result in a
revolution in night activities.

Participants were extremely enthu-
siastic about this session and suggested
others periodically. They also recom-
mend this form of discussion for other
small groups of recreation executives.
Mr. Curtis, who planned the session and
presided over it, suggests that such a
meeting is most effective when the num-
ber of tepics on the agenda is limited.

Convention New Orleans Style

From June 16 through 18, 735 dele-

gates to the fourth annual convention
of the Golden Age and Scnior Cilizens’
Clubs of the United States gathered in
New Orleans and formally became a
national organization. They adopted a
constitution, elected officers and district
delegates appointed a slate of profes-
sional workers in the field of the aging
to the advisory board.

What made this convention different
was the fact that it was cosponsored by
the New Orleans Recreation Depart-
ment and the American Women’s Vol-
untary Services, with the cooperation of
the Jewish Federation of New Orleans
and Kingsley House. Every one of these
organizations has a complete program
of recreation activities for New Orleans’
older peeple including many social-
service projects.

The National Recreation Associa-
tion’s Southwest district representative,
Bob Shipp, attended all the convention
meetings and was one of the speakers on
the subject “The Senior Citizen and
Current Trends.” His topic. naturally.
was recreation. Bob’s overall comment
on the convention program is that it was
a leisurely one, giving peeple time to
enjoy themselves, as well as hear some
good speakers. NORl) sponsored the
first of these conventions in 1957. The
general chairman of this year’s meeting
was Mrs. Betty Crapcr. supervisor of

the NORD Golden Age Club.

gently diffuse harsh light over a large expanse of window.
and retain their freshness through weather changes, humid-
ity, and repeated flexing. They are fade resistant, moth-
proof, and resist mildew and stains. Also important where
large numbers of people congregate, these fabrics are perma-
nently flameproof and self-extinguishing, as well as nontoxic

and allergy-free. Circle 102.

o All new for 1960 is the latest addition to MacCregoris
E700 helmet series—the E710. Among its features are an
exclusive geodetic crown suspension, padded with processed
Absorblo and combined with a heavyweight nylon head-
band; sound-deadening materials in ears to reduce roar and
echo; removable snap«in Absorblo cheek pads, and an ad«
justable snap-on, processed-web chin strap with padded chin
cup. The special padding is also used at forehead and neck.
extending up between suspension and helmet for greater
protection to vital head areas. The entire helmet can be
cleaned with soap and water, reducing costly reconditioning.
Stocked in solid white, the helmet can be ordered in an};
other solid color at no extra charge. Circle 103.

0 Refreshment areas in parks, community centers. and
schools can take on a new look with vending equipment that
is part of the decor. The Vendorlator Manufacturing Com-
pany has designed food and beverage distributing machines
that are enclosed in a housing covered with textured vinyl so
that only the faces of the machines show. These exposed
portions come in such colors as beige, turquoise, and pump-
kin. Murals repeating these eolors accompany the units and
are long enough to run the full length of a wall containing
four or five machines. Circle 101.

o A child-size trampoline, proving very popular in recrea.
tion programs, is the newest model introduced by the Amer-
ieau Trampoline Company, the F357N. Althongh designed
for youngsters, adults can get limited use from it too, as the
bed is of the same heavy nylon used on larger trampolines.
The 9'-by-5' frame telescopes together, and can be taken
apart in just a few minutes for easy storage. Circle 105.

ton for special performances and the
hall will have recording and broadcast-
ing facilities.

The playhouse, or theater, situated to
the right of the opera house, Will be en-
tered from a Wide circular staircase ris-
ing gracefully from the Grand Salon.
Entrances will also be provided from
the diagonal passageway that faces the
plaza to the southeast of the Center.

The playhouse will have a flexible
seating arrangement, with capacities
ranging from one thousand to eighteen
hundred seats, and will have recording
and broadcasting facilities equal to
those of the opera house and concert
hall. It will present to America, and to
the world, great classical and modern
dramas, musical comedies, operettas,
and a Wide variety of other productions
reflecting the richness and scope of the
performing arts in America. The pre-
sentations will include special produc-
tions by casts from the thousands of
community and summer theaters of
America.

Included in the plans are two audi-
toriums, to be located on either side of
the opera house, and they will have re-
cording and broadcasting facilities
equal to those of the opera house. These
two auditoriums, one seating four hun-
dred to five hundred, the other seating
eight hundred to one thousand, will be
used primarily for dance and poetry re-
citals and lectures. They will also pro-
vide suitable meeting places for thc
many nonprofit associations and organ-
izations active in the performing arts
and in the education, recreation, social,
and literary fields.

Located between the roof and the
scventy-five-foot ceiling of the Center
will be a number of offices for adminis
tration and various cultural organiza-
tions. Underneath the Center will be
parking space for some two thousand
cars.

THE NATIONAL Cultural Center is di-
rected by a board of trustees made
up of three United States Senators,
threc members of the House of Repre-
sentatives, nine federal and District. of
Columbia officials named in the act, and
fifteen general trustees appointed by the

SEPTEMBER 1960

President for staggercd ten-year terms.

The act also provides for an Advisory
Committee on the Arts, to be composed
of such members as the President may
designate, to serve at the Pleasure of the
President. Persons appointed to the ad-
visory committee must be persons rec-
ognized for their knowledge of or expe-
rience or interest in one or more of the
performing arts named in the act. In
making such appointments, the Presi-
dent will consider recommendations
submitted by leading national organi-
zations in the performing art fields. The
Advisory Committee will make recom-
mendations to the board of trustees re-
garding cultural activities to be carried

on in the Center. ~

This symbolic and functional institu.

gifts of citizens, foundations, corpora-

the National Cultural Center will belong
to the people—t0 all future generations

opportunities for active, as well as
passive, participation in the performing

Maintenance
Continued from Page 320

 

lated buildings, infrequently used, are
particularly vulnerable to vandalism.
For this reason, every effort should be
made to keep these buildings and the
areas around them in first-class condi-
tion.

Restrooms present a particular prob-
lem and should be inspected frequently;
cleanliness and sanitation are impera-
tive. In this'connection, design is most
important, and deserves a great deal of
thought. Light, air, and ventilation are
most important. Walls should be of a
hard-surfaced, durable material, such as
glazed ceramic tile, probably the best
possible material. While quite expen-
sive, its use proves economical in the
long run.

Design faults are more likely to be
found in buildings than in any other
facility. These faults stem from three
principal sources:

0 The building was erected for some
other purpose and later converted to
recreation use. This may make it diffi-
cult to use and maintain.

o The architect may not be familiar
with all the programs for which the
building is intended and thus may not
be aware of many abuses common to
public recreation buildings.

0 The administrator or program direc-
tor may not know enough about archi-
tecture to give much assistance to the
architect. The maintenance supervisor
should, by all means, be present at all
conferences concerned with building
and design.

Quite often a stipulated amount is
appropriated or designated by the fiscal
authorities before an architect has been
consulted. Plans must then conform to
the available funds, and this often re-
sults in many design compromises. It
is much better to have a clear idea,
from the outset, for what programs the
building is intended. This concept
should result from extensive study made
jointly by the policy-making authority
and by those reSponsible for plannin",
programs, and maintenance. The ar-
chiteet can then make appr0priate pre-
liminary plans and estimates. These
provide the fiscal authority with some-
thing definite upon which to base its
appropriation. If, at this point, the cost

336

is greater than the amount available,
the planning committee and the archi-
tect have a chance to revise their plans.

In the revised planning it may be
necessary to eliminate certain programs
altogether, thus reducing the buildings’
size. Maybe less expensive materials
can be substituted for those specified
and certain details omitted. If the ori-
ginal planning committee did a good
job, the architect can adjust his design
so future additions can be made to the
building, to provide facilities ,not pos-
sible under the current appropriation.
Such a compromise should not affect the
efficiency of the building or of the pro-
grams eondueted in it.

Copper downspouts, exposed valves,
thermostats, and electrical switches are
all very eXpensive items to maintain and
should be eliminated or located in
places inaccessible to the public. It is
not advisable to use vitreous china
drinking fountains. In addition to re-
placement cost, the damage done to the
building by failure of any of the above
fixtures or controls may be very ex-
tensive.

mmwmmnmmmmmmmmmmmm
6611‘ should be emphasized that plan-

ning is a continuous process. No
community is going to be well planned
if it concerns itself only with the hiring
of a. planning cxpert or two to draw up
a comprehensive plan to guide the city
council in future action, and expect this
plan to serve the planning needs of the
community henceforth. Just as commu-
nity living today does not fit the plans
of a hundred ycars ago, so will the plans
of today gradually becomc outdated as
community living changes in the future.
Planning. then, is a required continu-
ing process of municipal government
which is in the process of evolution and
(lcvclOpment.”———CLAUDE J. DAVIS, Mu-
nicipal Planning in West Virginia.

lllIlllllll|lllllllll|llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllH|IllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

THE PRIME PURPOSES of recreation

are very much the same for all 0011]-
munities, regardless of size. The pro-
grams and facilities to be found in each
community, however, are infinitely va-
ried. There is no yardstick by which
we can measure a community, and,
from this measurement, determine the
type and extent of a recreation program
to suit its needs. Pressure groups often

   
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 

point out that another community 0
the same size has certain programs 01
facilities, and take the position tha
their own community should do th
same. The success of such pressur
groups is evident throughout the coun
try; few cities are without “white ele
phants.”

Most recreation departments are or
ganized as follows: fiscal authority
policy-making authority, administrativ
authority, planning director, progra
director, and maintenance director. N
matter what the size of the community,
the foregoing elements are required.
Different titles may be used to desig
nate various operations, but no matte
what the title, the jobs are the same,
even when one person is responsible fo
all six.

No program can be entirely success
ful unless there is complete coordina-
tion of all its elements. Also, no pro-
gram is without its limitations; it is es
sential that these be determined an
always kept in mind. If this coordina
tion is present, maintenance need no
he the bugbear of administrators of ree-
reation programs and facilities. I

IF THE SAME CARE is exercised in ex-

amining the qualifications of the
maintenance supervisor as in selectio
of the program supervisor, there is no
reason why a capable person cannot be-
found. Such a person should know most:
of the answers and should know where
to find answers he doesn’t know. Such
a person will know how to estimate!
needs, how to prepare budgets, how to'
plan his work, and how to direct the!
work of others. If, in addition, he can
get along with the public and other su--
pcrvisors in the same program. he will.I
indeed, be a jewel. At any rate, a pro-
per examination of credentials will pro-
vide a maintenance director of a higher
order than the so-called handyman
called in from time to time to cope with
some particular problem, while most
routine maintenance is left to unsuper-
vised common laborers.

In conclusion, we must consider
maintenance, upkeep, and repair as in-
tegral parts of any recreation program.
If all components of such a program
are properly balanced, maintenance
problems should not be any dillercnl
from any others affecting the total rec-
reation program. 

RECREATION

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

4‘ Four new staff members of the Na-
tional Recreation Association’s Con-
sulting Service on Recreation for the Ill
and Handicapped will assist Dr. Mor-
ton Thompson with a new projcct on
recreation for the homebound. They
are: Virginia Cassel, Sheldon Reid,
Dorothy De Lisser, and Mary McRostie.

Miss Cassel has a master’s dcgree in
sociology and has had ten years rec-
reation experience including two years
with the homebound. Mr. Reid is com-
pleting work on his master’s degree in
recreation in rehabilitation; his past
experience includes recreation leader-
ship with geriatric paticnts in a long-
term hospital.

Mrs. McRostie was associate cditor
of RN, a professional nursing journal,
and has been responsible for a number
of articles on recreation this past ycar.
Mrs. De Lisser has had a great dcal of
experience in public relations and fund
raising. Her most recent position was
[hat of special assistant to thc executive
director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.

+ This summer the Consulting Service
started its second year on the sheltered
workshop project. At this writing, it
is planned that Doris Berryman will
visit sheltered workshops in Los An-
geles; Dallas; lndianapolis; Tacoma,
Washington; Birmingham, Alabama;
and Wilmington, Delaware. The first
year, the project collected considerable
information on recreation needs and
wishes of handicapped adults living in
the six communities already studied.
This second year, it hopes to develop
some specific plans that can be used by
any sheltered workshop wishing to pro-
vide service to these people. Thus far,
it appears that these handicapped adults
are deprived of many recreation oppor-
tunities most of us take for granted.

tion Association Consulting Service on
Recreation for the Ill and Handicapped.

Obituaries

 

0 Tony Myers, director of athletics for
the Tyler, Texas, Parks and Recreation
Department, died in May of lung can-
cer. In its tribute to Tony, the Tyler
Courier-Times, in essence, paid honor
to dedicated recreation workers every-
where: “Because he worked, willingly
and energetically, that others might
play, the city of Tyler paid him a sal-
ary. But, because he put into his work
the things he did . . . a debt has accrued
‘ that will probably never be paid. . . .
Tony was one of those good things that
all of us take, too easily, for granted.
He absorbed a lot of work, shared some
of the blame for everybody’s errors and
shortcomings and could always be
counted on to ‘take it over’ when the
road became rough.”

to James W. Geater, director of train-
ing and special services for the Wash-
ington, D. C. Recreation Department,
died in March of cancer at the age of
sixty-one. He had helped found the de-
partment’s “roving leader” program
(RECREATION, April 1960) . Mr. Geater
came to Washington from Anderson,
Indiana, in 1941 as a recreation spe-
cialist for the Federal Security Agency,
setting up recreation programs near
army camps.

0 Joshua Ringle, former director of
parks for Jersey City, New Jersey, died
in June after a long illness. He was
sixty-nine.

0 Mrs. Daphne Crane Mason, former
president of the Child Study Associa-
tion of America, died in Claremont,
California, in June, after a long illness.

0 John Kelly, Sr., died in Philadelphia
in June at the age of seventy. As vice-
president of the F airmount Park Com-
mission, he had sponsored the city’s
municipally operated playhouse. He
had also long been a benefactor of the
city’s Sports-for-Youth program. He
was Federal Director of Physical Fitness
under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

0 George A. Bellamy, a social worker
who founded the Hiram House social
settlement in Cleveland, died in July of
a heart attack at the age of eighty-seven.
During World War I, as chairman of
the War Department’s Committee on
Training Camp Activities, he super-
vised the establishment of recreation
facilities for soldiers.

0 Col. E. A. Deeds, retired board chair-

man of the National Cash Register
Company, industrialist, inventor, and
financier, died in Dayton, Ohio, in July,
at the age of eighty-six. He had been
a supporter of and a contributor to the

Mobile Units
Continued from Page 318

 

The recreation department of Dan-
ville, Virginia, also gets multiple use
from its show wagon. It was fashioned
from a discarded truck trailer, bright-
ened with paint, and tours each of the
playgrounds for auditions, rehearsal,
and performance of variety acts of all
kinds. It is also used as a reviewing
stand and as a portable stage for play-
ground closing events, athletic open-
ings, and other community affairs.

The park and recreation commission
of Omaha, Nebraska, operates a mobile
stage unit called The Show Wagon. It
originally cost over four thousand dol-
lars and is complete in every detail,
even to its own sound system, piano,
and a 5,000-watt generator for use
where regular power is not available.
The wagon is mounted on a four-wheel
trailer unit which can be fastened to
the back of an ordinary truck and
moved from place to place.

It is used primarily for talent shows,
which are auditioned in advance. In
1959 it presented thirty-two of these
shows, which included district contests
and finals. More than 427 acts, involv-
ing 806 performers, made up the shows,
and total attendance was almost 22,000.

Omaha also uses three playmohiles,
complete with play equipment and fa-
cilities, for a regular activity program
of crafts, games, and auditions for the
show wagon. These playmobiles visited
twenty-three locations in 1959, Spend-
ing half a day in each. Each carried a
crew of four, and registered over four
thousand youngsters. Total attendancc
at the playmobile locations was over
twenty-eight thousand.

The division of recreation in Cleve-
land, Ohio, operates a show wagon and
a traveling zoo. These units cover the
playground and park circuit during the
summer months.

The Westchester County Recreation
Commission in New York has bought a
ten-thousand-dollar bandwagon to send
to all parts of its 44'8-square-mile terri-
tory as a weathcr-protected, illuminated
stage and shell for outdoor concerts and
plays. It resembles a large house trailer
when towed hy car or truck. When
parked, one side opens to convert the
vehicle into a bandshell. The floor can

340

be made Hat for plays, or aranged in
steps for concert use. Overhead Huores-
cent lights can be powered by the ve-
hicle or attached to park power lines.

Since no park in the county has a
bandshell, and if constructed, each
would cost at least sixty thousand dol-
lars, this new unit is an economical as
Well as an efficient way to provide music
and drama to the whole county.

Other Types of Mobile Units

Mobile units are by no means limited
to playmobiles, show wagons, and hand-
shells. For example, the Los Angeles
Department of Parks and Recreation
has a number of unusual mobile serv-
ices: a traveling playground circus.
a traveling telescope, traveling roller
rinks, and traveling “Parky,” the Kan-
garoo Program, used in a constant anti-
litter drive and education program.

In Palo Alto, California, the recrea-
tion department has a sciencemobile
that extends the services of its junior
museum. It has glass-front cabinets on
one side for exhibits, and wire-front
cages on the other side for small ani-
mals.

The recreation commission of To-
peka, Kansas, not only operates a mar-
ionette show wagon (see references)
and a portable bandstand, it also has
a concession wagon. The recreation de-
partment of St. Cloud, Minncsota, oper-
ates a craftsmobile (see references) as
do the parks and recreation department
of Lubbock, Texas, and the recreation
division of the Oceanside, New York.
school district. Oceanside also uscs its
playmobile for shut-in and library
services.

The departnlcnt of parks and rccrea-
tion of Schenectady, New York, reports
a bookmohile supplied by the county
public library. It visits various play-
grounds during the summer, and car-
ries trained personnel for storytellinv.

The recreation commission of Long
Bcach, California, for a time, operated
a hobbymobile, really a traveling pho-
tographic darkroom. It was mounted
on the wrong type of chassis, howevcr,
making it impractical, so that it is no
longer used. The idea, however, is still
good (see references) .

The playground and rccreation com-
mission of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is very
mobile-minded. In addition to its trav-

eling bandstand and its playmobile, it
plans to replenish the game and craft
supplies on each playground each week
by means of a supply wagon. This new
unit will be made from one of the de-
partment’s trucks, then fitted with bins
and cabinets. Its maintenance divi-

We can use the machine to augment
the dignity of human existence.—

sion has also designed and constructed
a baseball-diamond marking cart to
carry bases and marking equipment
from diamond to diamond of a multiple
diamond layout.

In Conclusiml

A good park maintenance program
makes full use of new ideas in mobile
equipment. Recreation departments can
profit by their example. Need such
units be limited to the types mentioned
here? Are there other areas in pro-
gram that could be made flexible and
distributed more widely—areas in art.
perhaps, or in dance instruction; in day
camping; in sports clinics; in social
games like chess, or bridge; in art ex-
hibits; movics; nature: science; par-
ties?

Are there unserved groups that might
be served through such units—the shut-
ins, the older adults, preschoolers, the
handicapped, industry, church, housing
units, new subdivisions? Give it your
considered thought. Can you put part
of your recreation program on wheels,
with proper emphasis on quality and

leadership?

Recreation Counseling
Continued from Page 310

 

brings to the hospital individuals and groups from the com—
munity to convince patients that it is interested in their rc-
habilitation and return to society. At the time of discharge,
he refers the individual to such groups, providing them with
information about the patient.

Information should also be provided to the patient, re—
garding individuals and agencies that are ready to accept
him back in his own community. This, as far as I can ob-
serve, is one of the areas where we must pioneer.

The competent recreation leader believes that having the
patients assist as volunteers, in administering their own pro-
grams, has the same potential for a sense of achievement
and recognition as for those actually participating in an
activity. Using volunteers is justified for what it does for
them as well as for the services they may give. Involvement
of patients in creating and managing programs brings rich
rewards. The use of ward councils, as a means of expressing
patient interest in new areas, of modifying programs, of
evaluating results—all serve as effective motivators and
provide a kind of recreation counseling.

 

The restoration of rational inhibitions and purpose-
ful sacrifices is now one of the conditions for human
survival—LEWIS MUMFORD, author, civic planner,
and critic.

 

It is often said that “having fun” is an objective of recre-
ation. This should be the participant’s experience, not the
objective of the professional, since “fun” is an outgrowth of
experience, like happiness. If the participant, through ex-
perience, develops a sense of achievement, receives recog-
nition, develops a sense of worth, forms new friendships, and
has a sense of belonging through the experience, then he
is likely to say, “This is fun.” Good recreation counseling
will be realized only to the extent that professional recrea-
tion workers believe that recreation activities are a real re-
habilitation tool, and are necessary to the good life, both in
the hospital and upon the patient’s return to his community.

During World War II, a group of Navy chaplains was
visiting a hospital to view an operation. They were all
seated in the amphitheater. As the doctor entered, an officer
asked the doctor if he would say a few words. The doctor,
with the patient on the table before him, looked at the crowd
and around the room, and said, “This is my cathedral.”
Our gymnasium, craft room, music rooms, assembly halls,
play field, and the general hospital setting can be our “ca-

thedral.” if:

This publishing house must be con-
gratulated for its books on creativity in
children, for new books like this one,
and for Adventures with Scissors and
Paper ($6.50) reviewed previously
(April). Many books of this sort are
full of fine projects developed by adults.
These books are filled with illustrations
of what children, themselves, have done
with basic materials, enthusiasm, and
imagination. Not only do the authors
of both books talk about creativity, they
show what children have done, and
how, and why.

The use of string, ink erasers, leaves,
potatoes, and other simple things to
print designs is not new. The process
of using everyday objects to release
creativity in the child, rather than in
the art medium or in the finished prod-
uct, is a new concept, however. The
teaching process involves more than
“exposing” the child to an assortment
of odds and ends. This expcrimcnta-
tion helps him to develop his powers of
observation and imagination. With it
must go ability to manipulate the mate-
rial and tools. Selection and evaluation
of the materials develop critical judge-
ment.

Dr. Baranski and his editor, Italo L.

de Francesco, have produced a beauti-
fu| book for teachers and leaders in
schools and recreation programs. The
paper is fine, the type interesting, and
many of the two hundred and fifty illus-
trations arc in full color. Expensive?

It is the most exciting inventory of
a wide range of program activities all
too often omitted or neglected in many
communities. These are not fiy-by-night
programs. There are forty-five pro-
grams, operated by twenty-seven dif-
ferent public recreation and park agen-
cies; every program having been in
successful operation for at least three
years. They are programs for many
age levels, in a variety of settings, and
the activities are appropriate and adapt-
able to any community regardless of
size.

The Cabriclsen brothers—Dr. M.

Alexander, professor of education and
coordinator of the professional recrea-
tion and camping curricula at New
York University, and Dr. Bramwell W.,
professor of physical education and
swimming coach at the University of
Georgia — have joined with Betty
Spears, associate professor of physical
education at Welleslcy, in bringing out
a comprehensive book on aquatics. The
only activity left out is power boating.
Such subjects as the construction of
marinas, operation of ocean beaches,
teaching of swimming to the handicap-
ped. and bait casting are among those
not usually included in such a book.
The publishers announce it as a “com-
plete aquatics library in one volume.”
It is just that; and it is alrcady overdue
in a day when aquatics must include
more than a learn-to-swim program.

The text starts with a discussion of
aquatics in physical education, recrea-
tion and camp programs, and then goes
immcdiately into the all-important topic
of aquatic safcty. Liberal usc of photo-
graphs. skctchcs, and charts helps to
make the explanation of techniques and
performancc more clear. cheral recog-
nized specialists have helped in thc
preparation of somc chaptcrs. This
book should be valuable for old pros
as well as for amateurs.

RECREATION '

DYNA-SCAR PROGRAMS

Any recreation director can tell you
his duties are astronomical but today
they also have to be astrophysical. If,
as far as you’re concerned, Thor is still
a mythological giant, take a look at
the program for the 42nd National Rec-
reation Congress (see Page 303) and
note the session on “Using Science
Projects in the Recreation Program,”
on September 26th. This is being set
up by Science Service, Inc., and will set
you to sputniking and reviewing your
program with a fissiparous eyes. There
is no excuse for inertia—except as a
law of matter.

Further evidence of the arrival of the
nuclear age is reflected in the recent
plethora of science books written for
young people but containing many
ideas for the recreation leader seeking
program material. They also suggest an
excellent way to promote Children’s
Book Week, November 13-19. An at-
tractive exhibit of science books (or
book jackets) in your local library,
centers, or windows of cooperative
Main Street merchants and banks could
publicize your department with particu-
lar emphasis on your science clubs, na-
ture activities, games and stunts based
on fun with simple experiments, or
other activities (if any). Further aids
for Children’s Book Week may be ob-
tained from the Children’s Book Coun-
cil, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York 10
(ask for “Aids for Book Week 1960”) .

Among recent juvenile science books
(on a variety of “ologies”) of more
than passing interest are:
