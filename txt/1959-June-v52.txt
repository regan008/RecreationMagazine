On the Cover

Using a collection of RECREATION covers in this way
was first tried by Paul Veret, director of the Federa-
tion for Jewish Service, in Omaha, on a large June
1% National Recreation Month postcr, in 1958. He
used fifteen covers to achieve a gay and arresting
effect. He generously agreed to allow us to adapt
his idea to this month’s “special” cover for RECRE-
.uto:\'.Thank you, Paul Veret.

Next Month

The next issue will be in September, with more in-
formation on the Congress and material for your
fall and winter plans. This year, October will he
the “Congress Issue.” A happy summer to you all!

RECREATION

 

RECREATION IS PEOPLE

canvas. A group of teenagers planning a party. A father and son building a short-wave radio

3. LITTLE GIRL skipping rope. A white-haired Sunday painter capturing a memorable View on

set in the basement. A family on a camping trip. Recreation is people, doing all these things

and many more—because they find happiness and fulfillment in doing them.

At this time of year, when Americans are observing Na-
tional Recreation Month, someone is sure to ask: “What
do you mean by ‘recreation’?”

Recreation is not parks and stadia, boats and balls.
These are only the facilities and equipment that may or
may not be what people want.

Obvious? Of course. But how often we talk as if our
objectives were things rather than people! And ‘when we
do talk about people, we’re liable to talk about their ac-
tivities rather than about what happens to them as a result
of those activities.

Youth Fitness Week, Family Recreation W'eek, Recrea-
tion-and-the-Arts Week, and Recreation-Through-Service
Week are all people-oriented Observances, planned to help
more peeple know about recreation and what it can mean
to them. Recreation Sunday and Recreation Sabbath ofl'er
an opportunity to point out what happens to people, spirit-
ually, when they make creative use of leisure time.

Recreation was first identified as a field for study and
organized effort by men and women who were concerned
with human needs. Those of us who make the recreation
of others our principal concern today know that recreation
meets a very basic human need for self-expression, self-
realization, and refreshment.

Let us tell the world so. When we talk of recreation in
terms of people, we will 5nd greater acceptance of all we
seek to accomplish.

More young people will be attracted to recreation as a
profession because they will see it as a basic and import-
ant scrvicc to peOple. More leading citizens will volunteer
their time and cflort because they will be convinced their

1“.

eflorts are helping peOplc. More money will be forthcoming, to buy the things needed to bring rec-

reation opportunities to people. And best of all, more people will find new joy and meaning in life- -

new worlds—through recreation.

This June—National Recreation Month—is a good time for us to start.

Seamanship Program
Sirs:

The seamanship program planned by
the Peoria [Illinois] Recreation Com-
mission Department is to consist of
eight lessons as outlined by the United
States Coast Guard Auxiliary. Regis-
tration will be limited to fifteen per
class. The recreation department now
has a pontoon boat, twenty-two feet
long and eight feet wide. The course is
designed to appeal to the sixteen-to-
eighteen-age group. As registration
warrants, more classes will be sched-
uled. . . . Instruction for this program
will be conducted by the US. Coast
Guard Auxiliary . . . The pontoon will
also be utilized for handicapped chil-
dren’s cruises and retired men’s clubs.
Most of the program with the pontoon
will be within the harbor, but if the
pontoon makes cruises beyond the har-
hor, it will be accompanied by at least
one craft. Since safety is one of the
main concerns of the seamanship pro-
gram, this pontoon will be equipped
with all safety equipment as specified
by the U.S. Coast Guard.

The sea scout program, briefly sum-
marized, is as follows: They have
eighteen memhers with nearly every
high school in the district represented.
They have acquired a twenty-six-inch
inboard boat. They are now making
their craft scaworthy for this summer’s
program. They will follow the regular
sea scouting program and plan on ex-
panding rapidly as the summer goes on.

More on “Recreology”
Sirs:

I indeed enjoyed reading the article
on “Let’s Say What We Mean” in REC-
REATION Magazine [February]. A lot
of research was done on this and de-
serves to be complimented. At this
point, I cannot get too enthused on the
word of “recreology”* as part of the
recreationist terminology. Neverthe-
less this really whets the appetite for
discussion.

“It Must Be Spring”
Sirs:

“What goes on here”? Not one but
two letters in the March issue wax lyri-
cal over what, to their authorities, is
the recreational “discovery of America”
all over again. It must be spring!

Actually, they pay the recreation pro-
fession the highest tribute of construc-
tire criticism. They are that too rare

breed, the bubble prickers, who help

us clarify and orient our thinking. “c-
are thankful for them.

llnt their statements have left us
somewhat amazed that someone has
attempted to justify reereation's exist-
enee on a higher purpose than just
“having fun.” To quote them, reerea-
tion has “no aeeentahle philosophy giv-
ing this field an inspiring purpose.” it
should not he a mere gathering together
of people for the sake of enjoyment.”
What’s wrong with fun and enjoyment?
Don’t let’s go haek to the Puritans. Edu-
cation authorities learned years ago
that interest motivation {enjoyment}
heightens learning eapaeit}.

Where have these irediseoverers:
heen? What recreation literature haw
they had reading? Have they diseussed
reereation philosophy with its great
teaehers. leaders. and workers? How
else can they know whereof they speak?

If they had done so. they would know
that the great all-pervasive ohjeetive
of recreation sinee the days of its first
philosopher. Joseph Lee, has been the
full devel0pment of the total person-
ality.

To elteek on this. after reading the
editorials and letters in RECREATION,
we turned to the writings of Joseph Lee
and Howard Braueher from 1906 on
and, for want of another, to our own
speeches and artieles haek to 1924.
There is little emphasis in this litera-
ture on mass or individual fun as on
overriding purpose. The emphasis rath-
er is definitely planned objectives. sueh
as “eontrihutions of recreation to phys-
ieal fitness. health, and museular tone
. . . the prevention of adult and juvenile
delinqueney . . . the devel0pment of the
whole personality . . . soeial integration
of the individual,” and so on. These
have been the great underlying ohjee-
tives of the real professional reerea-
tionist, whose sixty-to-seventy-twt')-hour
week has left little time for writing
ahout them. As we said earlier, we don’t
know where these people have been near
nor to whom they have spoken. They are
eheering, as new, a philosophy and oh-
jectives as old as the NBA.

A CITY

music festival. Oflicially sponsored, it has been re-
ceiving praise and attracting attention from far be-
yond the city limits. The occasion of the festival was the

P IEW YORK CITY has just held its first citizen-sparked

two hundrcdth anniversary of the death of composer George
Frederic Handel, and it drew together under one banner
musical tributes to Handel from many important, diverse
city musical organizations. The New York City Handel
Festival was coordinated by the Department of Commerce
and Public Events, and its cost to the city was almost
nothing.

It grew from the suggestions of an inspired pair of citi-
zens who walked into the department and broached the idea
about six months ago. They said that other cities hold
musical festivals and that our own city might well mark
this important musical anniversary. Newell Jenkins, a dis-
tinguished conductor, and Dr. Thea Dispeker, a famous
musicologist, were these two. They said they represented
musical groups willing to pcrform Handel works over a spe-
cific length of time. They pointed out, with tho warmth
of devotees, that this anniversary provided a wonderful
opportunity to present a great cavalcade of Handel music
to New Yorkers, not only his standard works, such as The
Messiah. but also many of his lesser known compositions.

There were many compelling aspects to this. First and
foremost, anything that the city could do, officially, to aid
New York in maintaining, or even developing, its prcstige
as a cultural center, it certainly should do. Then, since this
was a project that required coordination over and above that
of the individual participating musical groups, it seemed
an appropriate role for the city. Then the haunting dream
some of us have long cherished, that the city would sometime
have an annual music and arts festival, returned. Music and
art are a wonderful form of recreation, but they are also big
business.

What was involved in a Handel festival? Just a program
publishing the events and some coordination? That’s what
we thought when we started. Mayor Wagner would be hon-
orary chairman. Commissioner Richard C. Patterson, Jr.,
of the Department of Commerce and Public Events, would

serve as chairman, and the Department of Commerce would
find a sponsor for printing the souvenir program. Robert
Dowling, real estate executive and patron of the arts, was
asked to be policy chairman.

The music and administrative directors selected four
people and a secretary to form a program committee, who
were outstanding authorities in the music field. They met
frequently, especially in the early planning days. The forty-
three members forming the music committee were repre-
sentatives of various musical groups who might participate
in the festival. Among them were conductors, musicologists,
artists, and music public-relations representatives.

Determining Policy

It was agreed that, since no money was forthcoming, each
group would pay for its own concert. Some had already
scheduled Handel concerts, so it was decided to extend the
festival over a period of three months. A hard-and-fast rule
was established that any musical event not falling between
March 1 through May 20, would not be considered as part
of the festival. The following were some of the rules we
adhered to strictly, except in some special cases.

0 The entire program had to be exclusively devoted to
Handel.

0 Only one program by each group would be included.

I Repetition of works was ruled out.

0 Some of the concerts were free; some charged admission.
Determination of this was left to the group concerned, de-
pending on its financial status. The Commerce and Public
Events Department handled the invitations, on behalf of the
mayor, sent to leading citizens in industry, education, labor,
and the music world, asking them to serve as an honorary
committee. Members of the city’s board of estimate and
other top-ranking officials were so listed, and some names
were chosen for their prestige purposes, to give status to
the festival. The importance of an honorary committee can-
not be overestimated from a goodwill standpoint. In the
festival souvenir program, sponsors, individuals, and or-
ganizations who had c00perated financially or otherwise,
were thanked in a listing.

This spring project snowballed into one of the most
significant city-sponsored events ever undertaken. Thirty-
two performances by different groups took place during the
period. Each group paid its own expenses. There was no

conflict in concert dates, so anybody could hear them all,
if he so wished.

Dr. Peter J. \Vilhousky, director of music for the city
board of education, enlisted the cooperation of high schools
to perform Handel works during that period, for orchestras.
choruses, and soloists. Well-known orchestras and out-
standing musical groups, led by famous conductors, as well
as many, many churches, produced all the various kinds
of music Handel wrote—orchestral, chamber, church,
choral, and Operatic. Amateur groups, clubs, Y’s, and
schools clamored to be included in this historic event. A
colored film on Handel’s life was available for f rce showings.

Private funds were raised to pay for a concert near a lake
in the Bethesda Fountain area of Central Park. Under
floodlightcd trees, Handel’s Water Music and Royal Fire-
works Music were played, in a setting similar to that sug-
gested by the composer for his own music.

Publicity

Publicity was needed. Fifty thousand copies of a well-
prepared souvenir program booklet were distrihuted to
those attending the concerts. The programs were also sent
to leading music libraries throughout the world. Art stu-
dents competed for the honor of creating the prize-winning
poster. It was found that the best introductory technique
was writing multilithed form letters, followed up with tele-
phone calls. This was used to find out which private schools
would participate and in what way—by giving a concert,
showing the film, diSplaying festival posters, and so on.

The Commerce and Public Events Department arranged
for bus and subway posters. .I.ea(ling Fifth Avenue stores
had window displays. Many circulars were distributed, the
printing of which was made possible by private sources.
Magazines and newspapers publicized it. People from Mex-
ico, Canada, and all over the United States wrote in inform-
ing us that they were planning vacations so as to be here at
that time. They asked if they could huy tickets, once they
arrived in the city. As a result of one announcement on a
local radio broadcast, there were requests, amounting to
six hundred tickets, for one of the free, outdoor concerts.

Leading business firms were asked to use Handel mailing
machine imprints at the I’itncy-Bowes’ cost price. of under
fifteen dollars a machine. The response grew beyond great-
est expectations. One Wall Street firm inquired if “Handel

could come downtown.” llandel window displays, in the
heart of New York’s financial district, were set up to show
that industry and finance were also interested in promoting
culture. Labor leaders also saw to it that unions got their
share of Handel—and the resulting publicity.

Finance

Meanwhile, financial support, based on an appeal of love
of music and civic interest, was sought from private and
commercial sources for various portions of the festival.
Dignified, page announcements in the souvenir program
were allowed, as for the Empire State music festival’s forth-
coming program. We had to reject sUpporters who were
anxious to get into the act to advertise products in a manner
inappropriate to civic dignity. The great day arrived when
the Handel Festival became selfosupporting; instead of the
city’s spending money, it brought in income, prestige, and
cultural recreation.

Mayor Wagner proclaimed the opening of the Handel
Festival. At a city-hall ceremony, the consuls general of
Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, and Italy—countries where
Handel had lived anal worked—presented Handel memora-
bilia, which went on public exhibition in various places
throughout the city. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and
the New York Public Library were among those who pre-
pared their own exhibits. The cooperation of other agencies
was called upon. For example: the assistance of the police
department was needed. to make sure there were no traflic
or security problems.

l\cw York City’s own radio station, WNYC, broadcast a
series of programs of Handel's music. Local radio and tele-
vision programs were heamed through' the cooperation of
the musicians’ and other unions. Closed circuit educational
programs were arranged. Major Handel works performed
during the festival were recorded and rebroadcast by the
Voice of America, to over two hundred million people
throughout the world.

The city’s “Scroll for Exceptional and Distinguished
Service," usually given only to visiting presidents. kings,
and such VIP’s, was awarded at the initial concert. And
each participating group thereafter was so honored.

This festival, we. believe, has sparked thc interest nec-
essary to initiate other types of festivals-~both art and

music in New York City. 4,."

A painting is not only something to be en-
joyed passively but something to create.

A rt museum tours more and more are a
part of a cultural recreation program.

Today’s expanding leisure demands new dimensions in program planning and challenges the

I‘ IS EXTREMELY interesting that in several of the Na-
1 tional Recreation District Conferences I have attended

this year the major emphasis has been on program. No
movement runs evenly along its course, and the recreation
movement is no exception. Advances are made by fits and
starts as new concepts are accepted. In the early days, the
concept of playgrounds for children, originating in experi-
ments in childhood education, fired the imaginations of so-
cial workers and educators and, in a remarkably brief pe-
riod of time. developed into a tidal wave that swept over
the entire country.

In more recent years, as recreation departments have
been accepted as an integral part of city government, other
concepts have taken the lead. The growing importance of
good administrative practices, the development of profes-
sional requirements in leadership, the expansion of areas
and facilities to meet the increased growth of population
and the urbanization of our communities—all of these have
preoccupied us, end this preoccupation has been reflected
in the topics used at our district conferences and in our
National Recreation Congress. A conference or congress
program, as you know, is not an arbitrary choice of any
one person or group of persons. It is a direct reflection of
current needs and interests.

As we have eXplored these important areas, every now
and then certain specific aspects of recreation services have
actually erupted, arid I use that word advisedly. The tre-
mendous impact of the teen-center movement in the early
1940's was one such eruption. More recently, the move-
ment for centers and services for older adults has spread
over the entire country. Even more recently, there has been
a tremendous growth in the provision of recreation services
for the ill and handicapped.

There is rapidly growing evidence another movement is
close at hand—if not already here—and it is of such dimen-
sions that its impact will be terrific. This growing move-

rector of the National Recreation Association, at several 0/

ment is the rapidly increasing demand for more of the
cultural arts. It is a demand for new dimensions in pro-
gram plannin".

I must point out to you that there has been an unmis-

takable lag in our profession in forecasting these great
movements and in being ready for them when they come.
The impetus for teen centers and teenage programs did not
come from rccreation departments. It came—by the thou-
sands—from the boys and girls, their parents, their
churches, the social and civic groups in the community. The
early teen centers were in many cases, literally, thrust down
the throats of recreation departments by public demand.

Now, people are turning to music, to art, to drama, dance,
poetry, literature, gardening, and nature, in an effort to
find more meaning in life, some outlet they can enjoy, some
means of expressing themselves. They are feeling the need
to use their own hands, bodies, and minds in a sort of re-
volt against automation. They want these things for their
children. They are dissatisfied with what their communities
offer, and this dissatisfaction very often is directed toward
recreation Opportunities. Just last year the Iowa Council for
Community Improvement asked, “What are the areas of
greatest need for improvement?” Replies from almost fif-
teen hundred pcople from one hundred communities gave
first place to “cultural arts and recreation.”

Every two years the General Federation of Women’s
Clubs holds a community-achievement contest. The pro-
jects chosen by the fifty-five hundred women’s clubs range
from new hospitals to symphony orchestras, from school
bond issues to urban renewal. However, their two main
concerns at the local level in the contest just finished were
improvement of recreation facilities, especially for youth,
and the creation of better educational and cultural oppor-
tunities. Never underestimate the power of a woman! As
a result of the project chosen by the Akima Club in Knox-
ville, Tennessee, a minimum estimate showed $100,000 was
being spent in 1958, for recreation in Knox County, that
was not available in 1956, when the project started."

day, when such requests were made only for football stadia

These examples are on the local level. Some of you may
have read Governor Rockefeller’s message to the 1959 New
York legislature. One entire section of it was on individual
and family life. In this section he said, “Economic growth

of his material well-being, but also of his spiritual, intellee-
tual, and cultural capacities. I believe our society should
afford greater opportunities to the individual for cultural
expression, participation, and appreciation.” .

President Eisenhower, in his 1955 State of the Union
message, asserted: r"’The federal government should do more
to give ollieial recognition to the importance of the arts and
other cultural activities.”

This ground swell of concern over, and interest in, the
cultural life of the nation has finally culminated in a new
act of Congress (Public Law 85-874), authorizing a Na-
tional Cultural Ccnter as a bureau of the Smithsonian ln-
stitution. It will be constructed through funds raised by
voluntary contributions, on a site made available in the
District of Columbia.

The center will be directed by a board of trustees, made
up of three senators, three representatives, nine public
ollicials, and fifteen general trustees appointed by the Pres-
ident. The act provides that the board shall:

0 Present classical and contemporary music, opera, drama,
dance, and poetry from this and other countries.

0 Present lecture and other programs.

0 DevelOp programs for children, youth and the elderly,
and for other age groups as well, in such arts designed

specifically for their participation, education, and rccrea-
tion, and

Ipation leader to devel0p increasing Opportunities for creative participation in the cultural arts.

0 Provide facilities for other civic activities at the Cul-
tural Center.

An advisory committee appointed by the President will
consist of persons who are recognized for their knowledge
of, and echrience or interest in. one or more of the arts.
This official recognition of the arts on the highest govern-
ment level is a momentous event that will have a dramatic
effect throughout the nation.

Mr. l’rendergast was recently appointed by Presi-
dent Eisenhower to the Advisory Committee on the
Arts of the National Cultural Center, to he built in
Washington, D. C. The chairman of this committee,
in turn, appointed him to a Special Committee on
Concepts, which will study and, then, recommend, to

the advisory committee and the trustees, the size and

character of needed facilities—an opera house, con-
cert hall, and a true national theater.

 

have a strong conviction if our recreation movement

cannot and does not meet this new challenge, it will be
bypassed and left primarily in a custodial or maintenance
capacity. What, then, must our recreation departments, and
we, as rccreation leaders, do? It seems to me that there are
four fundamental steps.

First, we should take time from our fragmentized life to
look at our programs as a whole. We should give them
the cold, dispassionate, appraising look a child gives his
new teacher. We must avoid being defensive over omis-
sions hut we must recognize some of our programs are facile,
routine activities that require very little from us in the
way of creative planning.

We must look at our schedules, and decide whether they
are arranged more for our convenience than for the public’s
benefit. We must consider our program as a whole, not
as a series of unrelated activities. We must stop justifying

217

our programs by quantity and accept quality as our standard.

That word “quality” is worth further exploration and
leads me to my second point. When the chips are down, the
quality of any program reflects the degree of understand-
ing and the personal standards of the person at the head
of it. This responsibility cannot be delegated. Recreation
literacy is not enough. There is a rising need for a recre-
ation intelligentsia.

We cannot afford to be out of step with the times. Today
28,500,000 Americans play some type of musical instru-
ment. (That’s one in six.) In 1955 there were more than
eleven hundred symphony orchestras made up of com-
munity neighbors. In 1958, there were over two hundred
professional symphony orchestras, and more than 250,000,-
000 records were bought by Americans. In 1954, 770,840,-
000 books were sold in the United States. It is estimated
that this figure reached the billion mark in 1958.

Americans own 141,000,000 radios and 47,000,000 tele-
vision sets. Yes, they hear and see many soap operas and
Westerns, but they also hear the Metropolitan opera,
Leonard Bernstein, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, and most
of the leading singers, conductors, dancers, actors, scien-
tists, and statesmen. They watch Hamlet and Greek trag-
edies. They listen to a university professor give a serics of
lectures on the development of the spoken word. They see
plays by Saroyan, Odets, Tennessee Williams, Maxwell
Anderson.

No one expects you as a recreation leader to be an expert
in the skills and techniques of all art forms. The recreation
movement and your community, however, do have the
right to expect you, as a recreation lcader, to explore these
areas sufficiently to develop good taste, an appreciation,
and an awareness of the values of the cultural arts, not by
lip service, but by actual work on your part. You will
never develop a creative, enthusiastic cultural arts program
Unless you, as well as your staff, take time to explore school
and college programs, museums, exhibits, workshops, mag-
azines, and books on the subject; unless you give your staff
the facilities and equipment to do really good work, and,
above all, your enthusiastic support.

The most important quality you can cultivate in yourself,
and work to cultivate in your staff, is the quality of aware-
ness. It is very interesting to note that House Beautiful re-
cently devoted over half of an entire issue to the quality of
awareness—seeing, not ust looking; feeling, not just pass-
ing by. That couldn’t have happened ten years ago. It is
another symptom of the rising pulse of interest in cultural
arts. More people in the United States attend concerts than
attend baseball games. How many concerts has your de-
partment sponsored or conducted?

Our programs are for two groups—spectators and par-

ticipants—yet these two are really only one. They are like
high and low tides. They ebb and flow into each other.
The best participants are those who have had their interest
stimulated, and curiosity aroused, by watching, looking,
and listening. The best spectators are those who have some
training and know what to look for and appreciate.

This spectator-participant relationship is of great im-
portance in the cultural arts. These programs are not
seasonal; they are not one—shot events; they cannot be
started by a clinic and terminated by a tournament. Each
is capable of endless progression; each must be planned in
advance with progression in mind; each has to be attrac-
tively presented.

My third principle in strengthening the cultural arts pro-
gram is planning. No one agency can, or should, assume
the responsibility of such programs for the entire com-
munity. Cooperative planning has increased dramatically.
In some cases, however, it is focused on some one event
or program, and has not taken the long-range view. A
better system of interagency communication may he needed.
Duplicated efforts should be analyzed. Degrees of responsi-
bility should be accepted.

Opportunities for cultural activities come as a natural
result of early training. Therefore increased effort

must be given to children’s cultural arts programs. All too
often, the natural, free, normal curiosity and lack of self-
consciousness in trying things is stifled in early childhood
by thc routine, mediocre outlets provided most children. We
adults are restricted by the attitudes we developed in child-
hood toward art, music, drama, and other activities. A
child accepts the world of today and is at home in it. We
must keep the doors Open for him and not box him in with
our own limitations. Our playground and indoor—center
programs for children must bc strengthened if we are to
develop the bcst in spectator and participant appreciation.
We can no longer limit our programs to what we think
people want. We must be able to offer wider and deeper
experiences, opening more and more doors, and creating a
climate in which individuality can flourish and find creative
expression. America may be preparing for a new ren-
aissance in the cultural arts. The very air is full of challenge.
One of the reasons for National Recreation Month, spon-
sored by the National Recreation Association, in June, is
to help thc public understand how broad the scope of recre-
ation really is. The four weeks of National Recreation
Month were designed as a framework for various activities.
In Proverbs there is a statement that we all must heed.
“Where there is no vision, the people perish.” As Wendell
Willkie once said, “Vile have freedom for great dreams—
and the opportunity to make them come true.” The time

is ripe. The choice is up to us. #

 

As automation advances, as new sources of energy are applied in industry,
as the hours of labor decline. we have the chance to become truly human by
using our new and disturbing leisure to develop our highest human powers
to the utmost.—Robert Hutchins, President, Fund for the Republic.

TIPS FOR SUMMER VACATIONERS

American pe0ple will have taken
over by the time this issue of REC-
REATION is published, and our highways
and byways, parks, forests. and beaches,
will be filling with vacationers in search
of new scenes, sun, adventure, fun, rest.
So, if you haven’t made up your mind
about what to do, where to go, on your
own summer holiday, you’d better de-
cide now. Even motoring calls for pre-
planning, as does every other kind of
trip or outinur. In addition, most rec-
reation leaders are beleaguered with
questions on such subjects. Below,
therefore, are a few tips to pass along
to others, to help you on your way, or
to take with you for an easier, safer.
more rewarding vacation.

Travel as Recreation

Some recreation departments and
other recreation organizations have set
up travel-counseling and vacation-plan-
ning services. The Recreation Promo-
tion and Service, lnc., for instance, in
Wilmington, Delaware, which is central
to the scenic beauties of that state, gets
out a bulletin of suggestions for family
tours, including a section on games for
the children to play in the car. Many
of these, by the way, are included in
the National Recreation Association
publication, Games for Quiet Hours and
Small Spaces, available from the Asso-
ciation for seventy-five cents. For other
books containing car games, see REC-
REATION, June, 1958, or write to NRA
Recreation Book Center, 8 West Eighth
Street, New York 11.

Recreation departments in industry,
too, have been active in promoting
travel-club activities. Club meetings
are devoted to speakers and discussion
on travel, showing of travel slides,
photos, movies. These clubs often enjoy
trips and other outings as a group.

\Vhere to Go

If you are taking a trip by car, jaunts
to historic places of interest are a worth-
while form of recreation. So many his-
toric celebrations are taking place
around the country, that it should be
easy to include one or two. Check with
your travel agent (it won’t cost you
anything), the AAA, or with the tourist
bureaus of the states you plan to visit,
whether near or far.

There is, for instance, the Norwich,
Connccticut, Tercentenary Program,
July 5 to 11, a week of festivities, to be
climaxed with a colorful parade on the
eleventh. Norwich is located along the
new Connecticut Turnpike.

In the Northwest, one would certainly
not want to miss the 100th Anniversary
of Oregon’s statehood. This means state-

wide celebrations, done with a Western
flair! Send to Travel information Di-
vision, Oregon State Highway Depart-
ment, Salem, for a calendar of state
events.

Going Abroad?

Statistics have it that citizens of the
United States spent over two billion dol-
lars abroad last year. Shades of Mt.
Vesuvius! In any case, many more will
go this year; so we mention two tours
below, for those who are looking for
something slightly off-beat.

220 RECREATION

 

camping provides an enjoyable and inexpensive family

vacation. Increasing interest in camping, therefore,
has encouraged manufacturers to produce a wide variety
of equipment, designed to meet all tastes and needs. How-
ever, this variety and wide price range present a confusing,
and therefore difficult, choice for the beginner.

Much of the needed equipment can be found in the home:
for example, dishes, pots and pans, silverware, hlankets,

IN THESE DAYS of spiraling costs, many are realizing that

thermos bottles and jugs, and collapsible outdoor furniture
are at the fingertips of campers-to-be. Large expenditures
are unneessary and should be avoided until the family is
sure it enjoys this type of camping and wants to do it often.
In many areas, camping equipment, including tents and cots,
can be rented. Some local recreation departments have set
up such rental service and at other times it can be rented
from the state or national park to be visited. In Spartan-
hurg, South Carolina, the parks and recreation board not
only rents equipment but gives out a mimeographed bulle-
tin about use and care of equipment, containing camping
hints, even includes a few recipes for camp cookery. As
the f amily’s camping experience grows, members will grow
in knowledge and will be able to purchase their own in-
telligently. Many types of tents are available, but most
families seem to prefer umhrella, wall, or Baker tents. It is
important to practice setting the tent up at home, before
heading for the “wilds.” A tent that is diflieult to set up
should only be used by someone with experience.

Tent fabrics are classified by “ounces”; the lighter
weights, of course, being easier to carry and to handle but
less durable. Heavier weights are more lasting but more
diflieult to manage. In most styles, fabrics will he available
in all weights, from five to sixteen ounces. A ten-ounce

may be used if great care is taken and waterproofing is
checked. A good test consists of hose spraying the set-up
tent for one or two hours.

In either renting or buying a tent, several things should

rather nice to have for ventilation. They should be screened
and have closures that can be operated from the inside and
fastened so no rain can leak in.

Next, the door should be checked. Both netting and can-
vas should be equipped with zipper or snaps so that they
may be closed completely. A two- or three-inch strip should
project above the floor and fasten to the netting for more
adequate insect protection. Be sure storm flaps on the door
can be closed from the inside.

Tent floors are a matter of preference. They are diflieult
to keep clean and diflieult to dry out and may be damaged
easily by eot or.‘t‘able legs. An eighteen-inch sod-cloth, sewn
to all sides of the tent, and held down by logs, rocks, or
dirt, prevents animals from entering or wind from hlowing
through the tent.

As far as the types of tents are concerned, all are ade-
quate for family comfort. The wall tent has adequate
head room and side walls can be rolled up for ventilation.
If the family is planning to sleep on regular camp cots, side
walls of the tent should be three and a half or four feet high,
to allow face room.

The umbrella tent is supported with either an outside
frame or a center pole with umbrellalike supports. It has
an extension over the door and storm flaps can be easily
attached. This tent may be set up with ease by staking the
four corners of the floor and extending the pole. A Baker
tent is useful for station-wagon camping. The tap flap can
he fastened over the side of the ear or over the back of
a station wagon to give added room and privacy. (See
“Market News," May, 1959, RECREATION.)

You can purchase tents with three or four rooms, but
they are eXpensive, require many ropes around the site
to hold them, and are not the easiest thing in the world to
put up. A second, small tent tsueh as the Army pup) is
more fun for the children and will protect them perfectly.

Today, tents are available in bright, imaginative colors.
They add to the gaiety of the vacation, and there is no
reason to stick to the darker colors. Actually, the lighter
colors. reflecting the sunlight, make the tent much cooler.
A good tent for a family of three can be purchased for fifty
to one lmndred and fifty dollars.

One word on surplus—be cautious. Canvas that has been

221

folded and stored for any length of time is likely to leak at
the folds. The waterproofing is often a heavy rubber solu-

tion that, although effective, adds greatly to the weight of
the tent.
Adequate protection for the cooking area, in case of rain,

is important. This can be a piece of old canvas or a ten-
by-ten or ten-by-twelve tarp tent. Number ten line or cord
will be needed to mount the tarpaulin. Tarps can be pur-

chased for ten to twenty-five dollars.
For families who have never camped before, blankets
from home, fastened by eight to ten blanket pins each, will

suffice, until they are sure they want to invest in sleeping
bags. There is a wide range of both price and quality in
sleeping bags. If you are not backpacking, wool sleeping
bags are the most reasonable. However, they are heavy, and
one must be careful to avoid getting them wet. The wool
absorbs moisture and is a mat of dampness in a short time.

A good Dacron bag ranges from fifteen to thirty dollars
and keeps you warm, even in cold weather. Well-constructed
Dacron sleeping bags, with two and a half or three pounds
of filler, give an average family many years of excellent
service. (Other brands of Dacron have been found wanting
—hence, the emphasis.)

An eiderdown bag gives maximum warmth with mini-
mum weight. It is excellent for trail hiking in cold weather,
but too warm for family camping in summer.

There are several points to consider when selecting a
sleeping bag:

0 A full-length zipper is preferable to a partial one.

o The bags can be opened to dry or used at home as ex-
tra comforters. Be sure an insulated flap covers the inside
of the zipper to prevent wind from blowing through.

0 A cold zipper alone has been known to spoil many a
night's sleep.

0 Avoid expensive sleeping bags until you are sure you
need and want them.

0 Don’t buy waterproof sleeping bags. They prevent
evaporation of perspiration, weigh more, and have less and
less insulating value as they are used. It is better to use a
waterproof ground cloth if you sleep on the ground. If you
sleep on a cot, waterproofing is unnecessary.

0 Full-cut sleeping bags are more comfortable than the
“mummy” type.

0 Only buy sleeping bags with labeled fillers, and know
what the labels mean. W arm-sounding names mean little.

While camping, you can sleep on the ground, in the back
of a station wagon, or on a folding cot. In any event, an
air mattress will make life worth living. The most inex-
pensive plastic air mattresses retail at two ninety-eight and
are comfortable, provided you are not too heavy. A puncture
repair kit is a necessary adjunct.

C OOKING can be done over either a wood fire or a gasoline

or compressed fuel stove. Stocks of firewood are limited
in state and federal campsites, so it is wise to bring your
own. Unless the man of the family plans to do all the cook-
ing, the compressed fuel stove will be a godsend. It is
easy to operate and helps prevent the “gay companion”
from feeling like a squaw. Many types of stoves are on the

222

market. In buying, it is advisable to be sure that the flame
will be protected from the wind by a shield. The two basic
types of stoves are:
Low-Pressure Compressed Fuel. Fairly expensive, easy to
use, and leaves no soot on the pans. However, in cool tem-
peratures, it is not too efficient. It is good to carry extra
cans of fuel with you. This type is recommended for quick
preparation of meals when time is important.

Liquid White (Nonleaded) Gasoline. Readily available,
requires more care in handling and pouring, must have
pressure kept up by pumping and have a safe storage can.
It is much cheaper than LP fuel. A two-burner gas stove
is ideal. A special modifier kit may be obtained for less
than four dollars, which allows conversion to LP canned
fuel and back again, as needed. The two-burner stove can
be purchased for between fourteen and twenty dollars.

Plastic dishes are useful for keeping breakage at a mini-
mum, but they should be a brand which will tolerate boiling
water. A handled equipment box is handy for storing
dishes, cooking gear, and nonperishables.

An insulated icebox cooler is needed to preserve perish-
ables. Be sure it has handles for easy carrying and a snap
lock to keep the cover tight. A spout to drain melted ice
water from the bottom is helpful. For drinking and cooking,
it is good to have two insulated three-to-five gallon water

jugs, with spigots at the bottom to allow easy pouring.

Basie minimum equipment and range of costs:

Tent ................................................................................................ ..$65-$150
Tarp tent (cooking area) .......................................................... "515- $17
Collapsible extension tent poles (four) ................................ ..$14- $20

Of course, substitutions may be made by improvising
equipment or using that which is already in the home. The
minimum list will take care of basic camping needs nicely,
but if you want more in camping equipment, the sky is the
limit. Many families design and have the fun of making
their own camping equipment. EXperience and the type
of camping you enjoy are the true determinants of your

needs. ( See also “Market News” page 248. Ed.) #

CAMPING SKILLS
ARE BASIC

 

 

. “I
The popularity of family camping cre-
ates new program possibilities. Most
family members need to learn slrills.

Annual course is put on by the l’asa-
(lena. California, Recreation Depart-
ment and the active local casting club.

0 THE LOVER of nature and living
Tin the out-of-doors Pasadena,Cali-
fornia, stands for “family camp-
ing”; though the follower of floral spec-
tacles may think it synonymous with
the Tournament of Roses Parade, the
Sportsman with the Rose Bowl Game;
and to the scientist and militarist it may
denote the missile and space age.
Realizing that most family members
need an opportunity to become familiar
with camping techniques, to take advan-
tage of the mild California climate
and countless camping sites set aside
throughout the state, leaders of the
Pasadena Department of Recreation
and Pasadena Casting Club first met
five years ago and discussed plans for a
family camping course. This has now
become an annual event and has grown
each year as more and more people turn
to camping as a vacation and recreation
activity. In fact, over three hundred

adult enthusiasts crowded the clemen-
tary school auditorium last year when
the course was conducted.

The recreation department, a coor-
dinated school and municipal depart-
ment, administered by the Pasadena
School Districts, has thirteen operating
divisions. One of the most important
is the division of nature and outing,
headed by a specialist who has worked
closely each year with a camping skills
technician from the Casting Club. To-
gether they have formulated the subject
matter outline, devcl0ped a mimeo-
graphed manual, and secured lecturers
for the six-session courses. From the be-
ginning, this program has received na-
tionwide attention.

Essentially, the family camping
course is designed to acquaint residents
in the area with opportunities and fa-
cilities for camping in southern Cali-
fornia and throughout the state, and to
instruct them in the equipment required
aml techniques involved in living in
rustic areas. Three fundamental cle-
lnents of a successful camping experi-
ence are good food, good sleep, and
adequate shelter and clothing for the
weather and intended activities. Of
course, this camping knowledge can be
applied anywhere.

With a minimum amount of equip-
ment, a skillcd camper can satisfy basic
needs and have plenty of time left over
for relaxation or for fishing, boating,
nature study, hunting, or the likc, de-
pending on the location of his camp.
Viewed in this light, camping skills are
basic to most of the other outdoor rec-
reation activities, and to thc exploita-
tion of the possibilities for relaxation,

inspiration, fun, and regeneration.

Session topics for the six evening
classes of the annual family camping
course are as follows:

0 Introduction; camping areas in

California; hiking.

0 Camping equipment aml clothing.

0 Camp foods and cooking.

0 Setting up camp; sanitation; safe-

ty; first aid.

0 Camp activities; children in camp.

0 Animal packing; back packing.

Near the end of each course, mem-
bers of this adult group and their fam-
ilies go on a weekend practice camping
trip in the nearby Angeles National
Forest, where they can apply the skills
and techniques learned in class. This
is always one of the highlights of the
course.

Experts from the community are in-
vited to present material; these include
representatives from the U.S. Forest
Service, Sierra Club, Boy Scouts, Girl
Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, other charac-
tcr-building groups, the Altadena Sher-
ill’s Mountain Rescue Squad, as well
as many individuals. An effort is made
each year to obtain different speakers
so new ideas and viewpoints will be ex-
pressed, but all in keeping with the
course outline. This up-to-(late informa-

HERE TODAY- GONE TOMORROW?

As our p0pulation becomes greater,
as industrial and other pressures close
around the areas of wilderness still re-
maining, the necessity becomes heener
for moving ahead with a program that
will preserve these bu ger areas for the
human spirit, seeing that they may long
endure for the recreational, educa-
tional, scientific, and historical uses of

the American people.
—REP. JOIIN P. SAYLOR, Pennsylvania

CITIES AND STATES across the coun-

try are waging bitter battle to

prevent their parks from being
despoiled and encroached upon by a
multitude of interests. No sooner has
a state park in Michigan been rescued
from the designs of a copper-mining
company than news arrives that two of
California’s state parks may be carved
up by the state highway commission
and commercial interests.

After a spirited battle by conserva-
tionists, the Bear Creek Mining Com-
pany recently withdrew its application
to lease 933 acres of Michigan’s Porcu-
pine Mountains State Park for c0pper
mining. The company had asked per-
mission to work in the 58,000-acre pub-
lic tract, which is reported to be the
last remaining wilderness area in the
Middle West. The mining threat stirred
strenuous protests from outdoor groups
in Michigan and throughout the coun-
try.

111 California, two of the state’s most
magnificent parks, Emerald Bay and
D. L. Bliss, were to be bisected by a
proposed new low-level highway and
bridge. The cost of improving the ex-
isting route so it would be free of land-
slide danger (which raised the ques-
tion of change of route) would be virtu-
ally the same as building a new high-
way.

Newspapers throughout California
joined in the campaign to preserve

these parks. The Vallejo Times' Herald
declared, “Expediency at the expense
of a beautiful piece of natural scenery
may seem all-important to a few small
business Operators. . . . There are cer-
tain matters in which commercialism
must give way to other considerations.
Friends of the magnificent redwood
groves from all over the nation have
joined in purchasing some of the stands
of redwoods in order to preserve them
for the future. lt would be just an sen-
sible to utilize Yosemite Falls, one of
the world’s outstanding scenic attrac-
tions, for generating electric power, as
to construct a bridge across Emerald
Bay, which, in many respects, rivals in
beauty and scenic attraction any of
California’s outstanding spots.”

The Metropolitan Park Board in
Cleveland, Ohio, also had to take a
firm stand, to stop commercial exploita-
tion of Cildersleevc Ridge in Cliapin
State Forest. The board first exercised
its right of eminent domain to appro-
priate twenty-eight acres of privately
owned ridge property to prevent its use
as a gravel pit. Next, owners were ap-
proached with a fair price for their
lands. The Cleveland News called the
decision “a timely and reasonable as-
sertion of park board authority. . . . ”

Farther across the nation, the Wal-
den Pond area, near Concord, Massa-
chusetts, wilderness home of Henry
David Thoreau, is involved in a head-
on controversy, involving “culturc, con-
servation, sentiment, and swimming,”
according to the Boston Herald. Ironic-
ally enough, Thoreau was one of the
first to write a plea for preservation of
our wildlands. Today’s situation, as
elucidated by The New Y orh Times, is
briefly: “Walden Pond covers sixty-
four of a total of about a hundred and
forty acres of an oak-and-pine-shaded
plot. . . . As a literary shrine, it has
been visited by thousands of students
on annual pilgrimages. . .

ingly popular as a summer bathing re-
sort. . . . In order to provide access for
service trucks and possibly an ambu-
lance . . . an N-sllaped road [was] bull-
dozed through the woods from Route
126. That was when a Committee to
Save \Valdcn was formed. . . .” At last
the bitter conflict between Walden the
“shrine” and Walden the “recreational
facility,” involving a $54,500-beach en-
largement program, reached such pro-
portions that the Save Walden Commit-
tee bas taken the issue to court; mat-
ters are still pending. Perhaps Thoreau
will have the last word after all—it was
he who said, in his world-classic Wal-
den, “We need the tonic of wilderness.”

A similar fight between wilderness
and recreation interests is shaping up
in New Jersey, over Island Beach, a
narrow sandspit between Barnegat Bay
and the Atlantic Ocean, about ten miles
in length and comprising a little over
two thousand acres. Legislation has
been introduced to convert this state-
owned area into a recreation facility,
not unlike Jones Beach in New York
State, administered by an “authority.”
The New Jersey Parks and Recreation
Association has voiced violent opposi-
tion to this plan. It points out: The
beach is in a primitive state, unspoiled
by the hand of man, with unusual dune
formations, covered with flora of great-

lic enjoyment in some manner that will '

place upon government not too high a
cost for development, and retain, in
maximum degree, the unspoiled beauty
of the beach.

I The lack of adequate state-owned
facilities, especially ocean-front facili-
ties, will inevitably lead to pressures
for the development of Island Beach as
a “multiuse” public park.

a The ideal would he to maintain
Island Beach as a “nature preserve,”
in its primitive state, without roads
leading through it and accessible only
by cars, to be parked at the northern
end, and by boat at points along the
bay, under such restrictions as will pre-
serve the flora and other natural fea-

tures. Under these restricted condi-
tions, the beach would still be extreme-
ly popular and certainly unique. Nature
trails and nature museums would pro-
vide educational media and the absence
of connnercialization would draw the
nature lover and the seeker for the un-
usual in recreational enjoyment.

In Ohio, when the state highway de-
partment proposed relocating U.S.
Route 68 through Glen Helen, Antioch
College’s thousand-acre natural-history
area, school camp, and school forest,
public clamor shook the state. As a re-

sult, Governor C. William O’Neill was
moved to state that, as a matter of poli-

JUNE 1959

cy, state parks and nature preserves
would not be harmed by new state high-
ways. The Dayton Daily News com-
mented, “These areas are a haven of
life forms, maintaining a balance of
nature essential to agriculture. They

“-’ r

are a source of spiritual inspiration
and mental calm in the midst of an en-
vironment cluttered with artificiality.
They are a training ground for the
natural scientists so desperately needed
by the nation.”

The Denver, Colorado, City Council
thwarted the efforts of superhighway
builders to despoil Berkeley and Rocky
Mountain Parks by construction of a
six-lane speedway. The council’s deci-
sion climaxed a ten-year battle over
the right-of-way of what will be one of
the country’s “superest” interstate
lines, with tunnels through the Rockies.

In New Hampshire, John Penney, di-
rector of the Concord Recreation and
Parks Department, appeared before a
joint session of the public works com-
mittee of the state senate and house,
concerning a proposed four-lane inter-
state highway through the superlative
Franconia Notch area. Mr. Penney
spoke for the entire country when he
said:

“The problem of encroachment [the
diversion of park and recreation lands
to other uses] is a nationwide problem.
Schools, hospitals, parking lots, shOp-
ping centers, residential dcvelOpments,
and highways all need space. Many
times it is proposed that such projects
be constructed in existing parks. While
these projects are worthwhile in them-

 

selves, they are detrimental to the origi-
nal purpose of the land. America may
wake up some day to find all . . . park-
lands diverted to some other use. Recre-
ation and park authorities, from the

are concerned with this problem of en-
croachment. . . . “I have no quarrel
with the state highway department’s
right to tell us that this route is the best
way to get to Littleton. However, with
all due respect to this department, it
seems reasonable to question its au-
thority to tell us that this road would
not be detrimental to the recreational
use of [Franconia] Notch. This aspect
should be the subject of a study by
qualified authorities in the recreation
field, such as recreation area planners,
conservation and natural resource ex-
perts, park administrators
forth]. . . . You may even want to go

[and so

out of state to obtain such expert ad-
vice.

“My point is that there is another
side to this argument, and you should
not take action until this problem has

been studied thoroughly. . . .
As The Christian Science Monitor

noted some years ago, in commenting
on threatened encroachment of Chica-
go’s park space that had been wrested
from Lake Michigan by filling in shore-
line, “The threat in most cases is not
from commercial interests, but from
sponsors of worthy projects. Yet one
exception could lead to another until,
as one park spokesman has said, it
would amount to ‘trading our heritage
for a mess of exceptions.“ ” #3:

LANS FOR THE 41st annual National Recreation Congress

—-Chicago, September 28 to October 2—take on an in-

triguing look as they shape up around our theme.

Speakers on a wide variety of topics have been selected

largely because of their ability to interpret the new direc-
tions indicated for recreation in the world of today, which
Boris Prcgel, former president of the New York Academy
of Sciences, calls “leisure stricken.” Among those definitely
scheduled, to date, are:
ARTHUR SHERWOOD FLEMMING, U. S. Secretary of Health,
Education, “and Welfare (the only two-M Flemming in Who’s
Who), who will address the Opening session. Mr. Flemming
has a diversified background of editorial and government
experience and was also one-time president of Ohio Wes-
leyan University. He has just been appointed chairman of
a national couneil on senior citizens.
HOMER WADSWORTII, chairman of the President’s Citizens
Advisory Committee on the Fitness of American Youth,
who will speak at Wednesday morning’s general session on
“The Role of Recreation in an Aflluent Society.” Mr. Wads-
worth is executive director of the Kansas City, Missouri,
Association of Trusts and Foundations.
CHARLES H. CHASKES, public relations director of the Michi-
gan United Fund, who will address a workshop on “Plan-
ning Agency Public Relations Programs.” M UF raises funds
for thirty-three state and national agencies.

W'orkshop in Supervision

The program for the workshoP in supervision, planned
around the topic, “Getting Management Information Over
to Employees,” includes the following:

EDWARD RYAN, editor, Employee Relations Service, the
Dartnell Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, who will serve as
moderator. Mr. Ryan is past president of the Management
Forum of Chicago, and, among other things, a former mem-
ber of the board of directors, Office Management Associa-
tion of Chicago.

ALBERT J. ESCHER, office manager of the American Institute
of Banking, Chicago, Illinois, board member of the Chicago
Office Management Association, who will discuss organiza-
tion of the communications function.

H. V. BOSTOCK, manager of the Employees Suggestion Sys-
tem, Illinois Central Railroad System, Chicago, who will
emphasize “Creating a Climate for Employee Ideas and Sug-
gestio‘ns.” He will use information from a recent study,
“How 100 Companies Make the Suggestion System a Man-

agement Communication Tool.”
HARRY HENDERSON, a representative of Burston-Marsteller

226

Associates, public relations, Chicago, and former director
of communications, Owens-Corning F iberglas Corporation,
will discuss the “Use of Bulletins, Bulletin Boards, and
Other Media.” He, too, will draw upon recent studies.

Institute in Administration

This year’s Institute in Administration will relate the
Chicago Park District’s long experience to the topic of parks
and recreation planning. The planning functions of the
Chicago organization cover all aspects of recreation. Plan-
ning specialization has given the Chicago Park District
executives and technicians an opportunity to develop meth-
ods and standards invaluable to many other cities.

Some of the people who played important roles in the
Chicago planning picture will participate. They are: gen-
eral superintendent GEORGE T. DONOGIIUE, who is in charge
of overall leadership in Chicago Park District planning;
VERNON F. HERNLUND, director of recreation, who will dis-
euss orientation to planning as an administrative function,
and philosOphy and principles of recreation planning; RAY-
MOND KNAPP, head of the planning section of the Chicago
Park District, which studies problems of population, land
use, and services of other agencies, who will attempt to an-
swer questions on standards of master plans; MAX W. MATZ,
landscape designer and planner, School of Landscape Archi-
teeture, University of Illinois; ROBERT A. BLACK, chief
engineer and head of the engineering division of the district,
who will inform parks and recreation executives about archi-
tectural and engineering services. The institute would not be
complete without a discussion'of architecture. EMANUEL V.
BUCIISBAUM, long-time architect and engineer, responsible
for designing some of the district’s most effective buildings,
will present this subject. Rounding off the planning institute
will be a discussion about the public relations aspect of parks
and recreation planning, to be led by ARTHUR L. SCHULTZ,
director of the Chicago Park District Division of Public
Information Service.

Outdoor Recreation Commission

want to tell somebody what you think Laurance Rocke- I
feller’s Outdoor Recreation Resources Commission should I
do? There will be a special meeting to discuss the purposes
of the commission and the direction in which it expects to I
move. Joseph Prendergast, as a member of the commission’s I
advisory committee, will lead this group. He will welcome '
comments and suggestions so that he may better represent
the thinking of recreation leaders in his work with the com- I
mission. Watch for later program announcements. 

RECREATION '

FIGHT FOR

YOUR SHORELINE

Public seashore areas are fast
disappearing today and will sarer
be gone tomorrow unless . . .

EASIIORE recreation areas are stead-
S ily disappearing from the pub-

lic domain. Yet interest in marine
recreation—skin diving, boating, fish-
ing, camping and picnicking, beach-
combing—is increasing tremendously.
A recent study revealed that in 1957
some thirty-fi ve million Americans took
part in recreation boating. Annual at-
tendance at California’s state seashore
parks increased nearly thirty per cent
from 1956 to 1957. The demand for
seashore camping is greater than the
opportunities therefor.

However, as the National Park Serv-
ice points out, “Of all the wilderness
environments which man has identified,
the true value of the seashore is per-
haps the least understood. It is un-
doubtedly in a large measure due to
this lack of full appreciation that the
natural seashore is already rapidly van-

ishing.”

The sad history of our coastlines,
outlined in the tragic study of the At-
lantic Coast, published by the Park
Service four years ago, Our Vanishing
Shoreline, is continued in the recently
issued study of the Pacific Coast, al-
though there are still extensive, unde-
veloped segments availahle, particularly

in the Northwest coastal areas.

The report states:

“Man is placing an increased dollar
value on [the] tidal zones [of the Pacific
Coast], not so much from his knowledge
or appreciation of their inherent values
as from his ever-increasing ability to
exploit them. . . . Vast tidal areas are
being reclaimed, for example, as gar-
bage dumps, airports, freeways, and
for private and commercial develop-
ments. State-owned tidelands have also
been sold to private individuals. In ad-

dition to the loss of these valuable areas
for public recreation the practice has,
in some instances, brought on a serious
problem in restricting public access to
the shoreline. Lack of public access to
the shoreline is, in fact, one of the most
general and pressing problems in the
situation today. The increasing pepu-
larity of the seashore and the conse-
quent influx of people to it have been
accompanied by the more extensive
posting of private lands. Along the
southern portion of the [Pacific] Coast,
particularly, people frequently drive
for miles looking for some means of
access to the shore.

“Other conflicting interests, too, play
their part in denying to the general
public its need for recreation use and
enjoyment of the Pacific shoreline. . . .
Subdivision and private beach dwel-
lings are utilizing much of the seashore
that possesses high recreation potential,
while industry—notably oil—is also
taking its toll. Then, too, beaches and
tidepools are being polluted by untreat-
ed sewage. Logs and other sea dehris,
largely the result of man’s activities,
have accumulated on other beaches,
preventing their use.”

HE survey covered over seventeen

hundred miles of general shorc-
line from Mexico to Canada. Included
were the coasts of California, Oregon,
Washington, and the Channel Islands
off southern California. Of the 1,448
miles of shoreline not in public owner-
ship and not available for public rcc-
reation, 527 miles were identified dur-
ing the survey as possessing important
opportunities for recreation and other
public purposes. These were divided
among 74 individual areas.

Seven of these 74 areas, with 190
miles of shoreline, were identified as
possessing recreation, scientific, or cul-
tural resources of major importance.

Five of the seven were deemed of pos-
sible national significance, the remain-
ing two of outstanding state park cali-
ber. The former five areas are Cape Flat-
tcry in northern Washington; Sea Lion
Caves and the Oregon Dunes area in
southern Oregon; Point Reyes Penin-
sula in north central California; and
San Miguel and Santa Cruz Island, both
in southern California. Congressional
action would be required to give them
national status. The other two, of out-
standing state-park caliber, are I’oint
Brown in south central Washington,
and Leadbctter Point in southern Wash-
ington.

Specific recommendations of the Na-
tional Park Service, as a result of the
survey, include:

o The Channel Islands collectively con-
stitute the greatest single remaining op-
portunity for the conservation and pre-
servation of representative seashore
values, including areas of interest to
biology, geology, history, archeology
and paleontolOgy, and wilderness rec-
rcation. Careful consideration should
be given to any future Opportunity to
acquire or preserve for public purposes
any or all of the Channel Islands group.
' A large segment of the Pacific Coast,
with high recreation and bi010gic val-
ues, is presently under military juris-
diction. Consistent with military needs,
the administration of these lands should
respect and preserve as much as pos-
sible of the inherent values involved,
until such time as the lands may be-
come surplus to military requirements.
If natural or recreation qualities then
warrant, they should be retained in
public ownership at the apprOpriatc
level of government.

0 There is a definite need for local au-
thorities, whcthcr city, county, or re-
gional, to take the initiative in acquir-
ing and administering seashore recrea-
tion areas of local significance.

0 Many more small-craft harbors are
needed along the Pacific Coast and it is
important to the public welfare that
this need be considered.

legislation to keep certain industrial de-
velopments off the immediate shoreline

line, and of oil wells by use of slant
drilling for tideland petroleum. Thus
additional seashore is left available for
recreation without undue industrial
sacrifice. More of this type of cooper-
ation should be encouraged.

_0 Serious consideration should be giv-
en to adding suitable portions of out-
standing marine biotic communities to
adjacent existing public parks and ad-
ministering them as marine preserves.
Other areas rich in marine life, although
not adjacent to existing public parks,
should also be preserved and protected
from exploitation. These preserves
would serve as sanctuaries for rare and
vanishing marine plants and animals,
and provide varied recreation and edu-
cation opportunities.

0 Careful consideration should be giv-
en to the preservation of marine gar-
dens or underwater parks.

0 Research is urgently needed to es-
tablish the full biological significance
of the mndflat and salt-marsh inhabi-
tants.

«- Legislation should be enacted to in-
sure the permancnt preservation and
protection of Pacific Coast tidelands
for public benefit.

0 California Highway No. 1, from Car-
mel south to San Simeon, follows some
of the most spectacular and highly sce-
nic shoreline to be found along the en-
tire California coast. Protection of all,
or at least a portion of this section,
from already encroaching development
through zoning or outright acquisition
of the lands involved, is strongly rec-
ommended.

N THE 1930’s the Park Service pro-

posed the creation of twelve national
seashores. The result was Cape Hatteras
National Seashore area in North Caro-
lina. The other eleven areas have “van-
ished,” according to the Park Service,
which is currently completing its study
of the Great Lakes shorelines. Earlier
this year, it pr0posed that the outer
arm of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, one
of three areas recommended for fed-
eral preservation in the Atlantic Coast
study, become a thirty-tliousand-acre
national seashore.

Boundaries of the proposed Cape Cod
area would include a ribbonlike terri-
tory extending approximately forty

230

miles along the outer beach from Pro-
vincetown to the tip of Nauset Beach
and nearby Morris Island and Harding
Beach in Chatham. The bulk of the
proposed arca lies east of U.S. Highway
6, and its average width approximates
one mile. National Park Service direc-

tor Conrad L. Wirth estimates as much
as $16,000,000 might be needed.

Inland the situation is much the same.
The Tennessee State Planning Com-
mission has issued stern warning that
new laws and new policies are needed
to guide land use and reserve space for
future growth of recreation areas along
the state’s reservoirs, many of which
are Tennessee Valley Authority and
Army Corps of Engineers projects. The
commission points out, “Twenty years
ago the few TVA planners concerned
with recreation values had a rough
time and met plenty of ridicule. Today,
forty thousand boats and three million
man-days of fishing per year are just
indices of how right they were.”

The TVA no longer maintains recre-
ation facilities but continues to lease,
sell, and transfer recreation land to
public and private interests. Accord-
ing to a study of the problems and op-
portunitics created by the reservoirs
published in 1958 by the Tennessee
State Planning Commission, Reservoir
Shoreline Development in Tennessee, 3
195? TVA survey “indicates an esti-
mated investment of $72,000,000 in
recreation facilities and equipment
along the shorelines of the entire val-
ley (an increase of $12,000,000 over
1956) . This figure includes $49,600,000
in land-based recreation facilities (in-
cluding private cottages) and $22,400,-
000 in hoats, boathouses, and floating
equipment kept on the lakes (but not
including boats brought to the lakes
on trailers). This represents an in-
crease of over 400 per cent over 1946.
. . . Boats alone (only those kept on the
lake) numbered 40,000 and were val-
ued at $17,400,000. Overnight rental
units were valued at $7,600,000, with
a capacity of 9,300 people. TVA fur-
ther estimated waterfront commercial
recreation operations in the valley
grossed $6,880,000 in 1956, an increase
of ten per cent over 1955. . . . The rec-
reation business on all TVA reservoirs

in 1957 provided the equivalent of fif-
teen hundred full-time operating jobs.
TVA estimates indicate that, for each
dollar spent at the shorelines, up to ten
dollars are spent in the region and the
gross recreation business resulting from
its reservoirs may total fifteen per cent
of the recreation business in the valley.
. . . TVA has projected a tripling of
person-day visits by 1975; if this ma-
terializes, visits to reservoirs in Ten-

nessee should reach 50,000,000 per
yearf’

The Army Corps of Engineers has no
general authority to acquire land for
recreation unless Congress so orders
when the project is authorized. How-
ever it can acquire access area around
reservoirs and provide road access to
them and license these areas to some
government agency for development
and operation.

WITH newly made recreation areas
available, it is a sad fact that
Tennessee municipalities and counties
are not accepting park sites being re-
tained for them by federal agencies
and, in some cases, not even preserving
public access to these shorelines, be-
cause of lack of foresight and planning,
not utilizing enabling legislation, and
purblindness. The commission advo-
cates a state recreation policy that
would “specify the state’s responsibil-
ity in providing public access as well
as other types of recreation facilities
along the reservoirs and in rendering
adequate technical assistance. . . .
The vacationing family should be able
to find suitable facilities in the form
of reasonably priced resort villages,
tent-camping areas, marinas, wilder-
ness areas for hiking and nature study.
. . . The state game and fish program
will also suffer unless suitable public
access land is provided the hunter and
fisherman or else agreements negoti-
ated whereby access over private land
is allowed.”

Were Lewis Carroll to survey the
country’s seaside situation he might
be moved to rewrite “The Whiting and
the Snail” thus:

“Will you walk a little faster?” said
a whiting to a snail,

“There’s encroachment close behind us,
and it’s treading on my tail.”

many will find that the simplest way to
record them is by making blueprints.
These are as much fun as magic.

print (or litmus) paper turns bright
blue. The best frames are the regular
blueprint or printing frames from a
photographic supply store. You can
make thc frames yourself, however. Get
a sheet of glass, at least five by seven
inches, an old photographic plate from
a photographer. Scrub it clean and cut
a piece of corrugated cardboard from a
carton the same size. Tape the edges
of the glass; thcn place on the card-
board and tape one end of the glass
and cardboard together.

Buy some blueprint paper cut in five-
by-seven-inch sheets. it is almost im-
possible to cut it yourself without wast-
ing a great deal, for you need a dark-
room, and the uncut sheets are difficult
to manage. If a local blueprint shOp
cannot provide you with paper, it may
be bought from supply houses such as
Eugcne Dietzgen Company f New York,
Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans,
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
and Milwaukee), from Keufiel 8: Esser
Company (New York, Chicago, and
San Francisco), or from others.

To begin, lay a pressed (prcfcrably)
or fresh flower or leaf on the glass in-
side the framc. Then place a piecc of
blucprint paper taken quickly from a

dark box or magazine, sensitive side
down, on the flower or leaf. Put the
cardboard back down and hold together
firmly, pressing the glass against your
chest so as not to expose the paper to
the light. Then go outside and expose
the paper to the sun, taking care that
the plant does not slip and that your
head or fingertips do not shadow the
print. When the print is sufficiently ex-
posed, return to the table, lift out the
paper, then wash and rinse it thorough-
ly in cold water. To determine the time
for exposure cut a piece of papcr in four
parts and test by exposing them to the
sun, one piece for fifteen, one for thirty,
one for forty-five, and onc for sixty
seconds. Wash them and use the time
necessary for the brightest blue for all
your prints.

if you ask it to. In our country, farm boys ask the daddy
longlegs to point out the right direction.

The world is full of folk belicfs and superstitions of this
sort. Many of them are about insects. A few are true. Most
of them are pure imagination . . . an attempt to understand
and explain the world around us.

Animals in Armor

“The exception proves the rule!” You’ve heard that he-
forc. Nowhere is it more truc than with the insects.

There are so many kinds of insects and they differ so
much in their shapes and habits that no one book [or article]
can describe thcm all. Here we can only mention a few of
thc most important things that are true of most insects, most
of the time. Remember, there are always a few that don’t
obey thc rules. Remember, too, that unless you are told
otherwise, the insects described here are full grown. The
young are often very different.

Insects are alive; they aren’t viruses, and they aren’t
plants, so they have to be animals. They hatch from eggs.
They move about. They breathe, eat, sleep, and grow. They
see, hear, taste, smell, and feel the world around them—or
act as though they do. They find mates, lay their own eggs,

RECREATION

 

1d die. They do all the things other animals do, but they
Io them in ways which are all their own.

Think of moving, for example. We do it by means of
muscles attached to a framework of still bones with joints
between them. All our organs are suspended from this frame-
work, and the whole is covered with a soft elastic skin.

lf this is how bodies ought to he built, then insects are
inside out! They have no bones at all. Instead, their skins
are thickened and hardened to form a suit of armor. Stiff
plates called “sclerites” are separated by thin-skinned joints
called “sutures.” Their muscles are attached to the inside

of the plates. The area of muscle attachment is huge, com- .

pared with the size of the insect. This makes the insect
very strong. You often read that an inseet’s muscles are
stronger than those of a man, but this is only slightly true.
The big difference is that the insect has more muscles.

A hard shell-like skin doesn't grow. It can only stretch a
little at the joints. Yet a young insect may double its size
overnight. How? By moultinw. The insect grows a new
and larger skin inside the old one; the new skin is all
wrinkled up to make it fit inside. Then the insect swallows
air and blows itself up like a balloon. The tight old skin splits
down the back. Humping and tugging, the insect wriggles
out. Its new skin stretches smooth as it pulls free.

The insects inherited this outside skeleton from their
distant ancestors, the jointed worms. They share it with
a great family of cousins—eentipedes, millipedes, spiders,
ticks, scorpions, daddy longlegs, horseshoe crabs, true crabs,
lobsters, barnacles, and many more. All these cousins differ
from worms by having jointed legs.

Long ago, when scientists first started to sort all the
animals in the world, they began by dividing them into
large groups called phyla (pronounced fi' la, plural; sin-
gular. phy-lnml. The insects and their cousins, all the
animals with outside skeletons and jointed legs, went into
the phylum Arthropoda. (Arthropoda means “jointed feet”
in Greek, and is pronounced ar'throp’o'da.) There is no
common or English name for them, so we call the members
of this phylum arthropods. Four-fifths of all the animals in
the world are arthropods. lt takes twenty other phyla to
cover the other fifth!

There are a million or more different kinds of arthropods
now living. Fossils tell us of others now extinct. \lost scien-
tists believe that all these animals are descended from the
same ever-so-great-grandfather. This common ancestor
died hundreds of millions of years ago. No fossil specimen
has ever been found. However, we can get a pretty good
idea of what it was like by comparing the kinds we know.

The development of the young before they hatch often
tells us more than we can learn by studying their parents.
From the study of modern arthropods, both mature and un-
hatched, we have learned that their common ancestor was
like a worm with feet. Its long body was built in segments
or rings. On each segment, except the first and the last, there
was a pair of jointed legs. 0n the front segment were a pair
of eyes and a pair of feelers or antennae. The mouth was
in the suture between the first and second segments. There
was no real head on this long-ago rndimentary arthropod.

JUNE 1939

This basic design proved very adaptable. Little by little,
through the ages, all sorts of changes have been made in it.
These changes have filled arthropods to live in all sorts of
places and to do all sorts of astonishing things. Legs have
been lost, or put to other uses than walking. Segments have
grown together or disappeared. The huge phylum Arthrop-
oda is broken up into classes-was the phyla are—according
to the numher and grouping of the segments the animals still
have, and the number and uses of their remaining legs.

You can tell an adult insect from any other arthropod by
a combination of three simple things: their bodies are
huilt in three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdo-
men; they have three pairs of legs; they have one pair
of antennae.

Spiders, for instance, are not insects—because their bodies
are built in two sections only, and they have four pairs of
legs, but no antennae. So, you see, they are only distant

cousins of the insect. Another thing—an arthropod with
wings has to he an insect. None of the others have ever
learned to fly.

 

With proper guidance, young naturalists will thrill to won-
ders of community life of insects, spend hours observing.

Many of the insect's senses center in its antennae. The
feathery antennae of some male moths are organs of scent,
and they use them to find their mates. Most other insects
probably smell with their antennae. Those which have no
special “ears” probably hear with them, too. Antennae have
a delicate sense of touch, though other parts of the body
share this sensitivity. With its antennae, a bee can tell how
far it is to the flower hed. If you have ever watched two ants
touching antennae when they meet, you must suspect that
this is their form of conversation. Scientists think so, too,
though as yet they do not understand the ants’ language!

[Insects are fun to read about, but a lot more fun to know
personally . . . and the best way to get started is by making
an insect collection. It takes practice, but if you keep
trying, you can learn to da it as well as a professional!

Steps from the field trip to the starage box can be
learned, with care. This is just a taste of the knawledge
you must have if you are to be an insect collector, or con-
tribute insects to your nature museum. Group leaders,
members, habbyists can find much fascinating reading on
such subjects. There is, of course, always Maeterlinck's
classic Life of the Bee. The group, or club, will probably
want to establish its own nature library.——Ed.]

PART 1

Their prospects in relation
to new program demands . . .

A LOOK AHEAD . . .

at Lands and Facilities

George Butler

look ahead, to be significant, must be based upon an

A understanding of both the present situation and the

forces that have been at work in the past and that

may likewise influence the future. Consideration of these

facts, in relation to areas and facilities, reveals a much

rougher road than the one portrayed for recreation pro-

grams. With the increasing competence of our professional

recreation leadership, and with better informed and more

highly organized lay support, however, we need not fear
for the future.

One or two principles or assumptions are indicated:

1. All recreation areas, buildings, and facilities have,
as their primary purpose and function, service to people.
We must think of them in terms of their contribution to
the welfare of men, women, and children and not merely
as space and physical structures.

2. The requirements of the recreation program determine
the types of prOperties that should be acquired and the
manner in which they should be developed. Unfortunately
this has not always been the case, for many programs have
been determined and restricted by the available areas and
facilities.

3. A corollary of this. sUpportcd by experience, is that
creation of a program interest should precede provision of
special facilities for it. Many successful programs have
been developed with limited facilities. Their popularity
and success have resulted in and justified a demand for
more or better. Many excellent facilities provided before
there was any real demand for them have received relatively
little use.

4. Although recreation is a distinct aspect of life; it does
not exist in a vacuum. Likewise the future programs, areas,
and facilities of recreation agencies will be influenced by
developments in other fields.

Land

Land for recreation is of fundamental importance, but
what is the recreation land situation today? According to

the best available data, the growth in park acreage since
1940 has failed to keep pace with p0pulation gains; the
loss was still greater between 1950 and 1955 than in the
preceding decade. At the end of 1955, only one city in
four met the standard of one acre per hundred population

BUTLER, director of research, Natiortai Recreation Associa-
tion.

234

and that percentage would have been smaller if out-of-the-
city parks had been excluded.

In view of these figures and of the rapidly mounting com-
petition for land, especially in metropolitan areas, I fail
to share the optimism of the experts who, as reported in
the January, 1959, issue of RECREATION, prophesied that
within ten years at least one city in four will have reached
twice the recreation space called for by today’s standard.
Robert Moses may have overstated the case when he said:
“No major park acquisition is accomplished except over
the dead bodies of obstructionists,” but he certainly was
pointing out a basic truth. Perhaps this is one reason why
in recent years there has been a greater tendency to vote
for such items as city auditoriums, stadiums, civic centers,
and swimming pools than for land acquisition. Some plan-
11ers apparently become more timid when proposing land
purchase than when recommending its development. Let
me cite a single example.

By 1902, eighty per cent of the lands presently comprising
the pioneering Boston metropolitan park system had been
acquired—in the half century since that time only twenty
per cent had been added. Since 1945, the system lost twice
as many acres to other uses as it added, primarily for park-
ways. Yet in a long-range program developed in 1956,
calling for a total expenditure of $81,500,000, only $4,000,-
000 were proposed for land acquisition.

These public funds will and should continue to be the
basic source of money for the purchase of recreation lands,
but there are one or two lines of action that we must take
more aggressively if our recreation acreage is to keep even
with population growth.

One relates to the dedication by subdividers of land for
recreation. Builders will be convinced that a playground
in their subdivisions will sell lots at a higher price, ac-
cording to the prophets cited in the RECREATION article just
mentioned. William E. Harmon, the noted realtor, made a
similar assertion forty years ago, and the National Recrea-
tion Association spent large sums trying to demonstrate it
to realtors and planners, to little avail. However, regula-
tions adopted in many cities forced developers to dedicate
land for recreation: the usual result—small, irregular, value-
less plots, unsuited for the purpose. More recently adopted
regulations have required deve10pers, as a condition of
securing approval of a subdivision, to contribute a certain
percentage of the total value of their land or a certain
number of dollars per lot or acre. These provisions enabled
areas of suitable size, type, and location to be acquired,

RECREATION

in accordance with an overall plan. However, the constitu-
tionality of such regulations has been questioned by the
courts and their future is therefore uncertain. Because
recreation areas, like streets and utilities, are essential for
home purchasers, state legislation governing the local con-
trol of subdivisions should be amended to recognize recre-
ation Space as essential and to authorize regulations requir-
ing that either suitable land or money be contributed for
this purpose. Such legislation has been presented in the
Maryland legislature.

Gifts played a large part in the acquisition of recreation
areas in the early days. Thirty years ago, approximately
one-third of the total acreage of city park and recreation
areas had been acquired by gift. Comparable figures are
not available today, but it is obvious that this ratio has not
been maintained. Yet the examples of generous gifts by in-
dividuals and families of both large and small recreation

areas illustrate the inherent potential of this source.

Purchase. COOperation with school authorities in the pur-
chase of land designed for school and community recreation
use affords another promising means of helping solve the
land problem. Such cooperation is logical, economical, and
mutually advantageous. The striking advances that have
been made in such cool)eration during the past decade will
inevitably be extended widely in the years ahead. It is en-
couraging that in its recent booklet School Sites, Selection,
Development, and Utilization, the United States Office of
Education, perhaps for the first time, wholeheartedly en-
dorsed the principle that community agencies have a share
in the planning of school properties.

Allies. Sound, adequate systems of recreation areas can-
not be acquired without the understanding and support of
city-planning authorities. We must enlist them as our allies
and make sure that they understand our objectives and re-
quirements. As Hugh Pomeroy, well-known planner, has
stated, physical planners do not generally attempt to set
standards; they apply standards for areas and facilities set
by the professions involved. However, since their plans
afford the primary basis for the development of capital
programs, including land acquisition, it is of the utmost
importance that we provide the planners with proper stand-
ards and make sure that they are correctly applied and in-
terprcted.

A person looking ahead is blind indeed if he does not
see many roadblocks to the prevention of threatened en-
croachments. We must face the fact that the battle to retain
our recreation lands will continue without let-up; a pessimist
would say that the situation will worsen. Here again the
planners can be our allies, for they have a hand in the
location of roads, fire stations, disposal plants, and civic
centers, but we must convince them of the validity of our
case. If our properties are badly laid out, poorly main-
cained, and casually used, we will have difficulty in proving
they are sacred. lf we are holding land for which no use
plan has been developed, approved by the authorities, and
endorsed by the public, how much support can we expect
in protesting its use for another worthy public purpose? lf

we have ad0pted no basic land policies, officially approved
by the city authorities, we are deprived of a valuable weapon
in fighting proposed encroachments. On the other hand, if
we have demonstrated that we are using our lands intel-
ligently and effectively, we can enlist strong support in
combating attempts to take our areas and can at least insist
that properties diverted for other uses be replaced.

The planners too can help influence the shape of our
cities so we can do a better job. We must recognize the
opportunities urban renewal programs offer for getting
more land near the city center, not merely for neighbor-
hood parks and playgrounds, but for informal walkways and
beauty spots. Town planner Albert Meyer recently asked
this pertinent question: “Are our city and region better
ofi to spend, say $500,000,000 on highways, or to Spend half
that’ on playgrounds, green areas, local community facilities
and operations that may give greater happiness and, by
keeping people pleasurably where they are, minimize the
load on highways, and hence reduce their cost?” We must
he prepared to influence such decisions.

Many other sights, some of them related to state and fed-
eral areas, are apparent to the person looking ahead in rec-
reation lands; let us consider buildings and facilities.

Buildings

Diversified year-round recreation programs are impos-
sible without properly designed buildings. It seems certain

that buildings designed for recreation will take a wide
variety of forms.

The significance attached to architecture as related to our
field is illustrated by three recent or current projects, all
financed by foundation funds, with two of which we have
been associated. One was the study conducted by a com-
mission of the Adult Education Association, which issued
a report entitled Architecture for Adult Education, contain-
ing sections on recreation buildings, schools, and other
buildings with recreation facilities. This year the American
Psychiatric Association issued a profusely illustrated volume
entitled Psychiatric Architecture, in which much considera-
tion is given to recreation and a major section is devoted
to activity areas. A committee of the National Social Wel-
fare Assembly is now preparing a publication on the plan-
ning of centers for the aging, in which recreation facilities
will have a primary role. I mention these projects, not
only to imply that foundation funds could profitably be'
expended on a study of community recreation buildings, but
to support the contention that many types of agencies,
other than public recreation departments, will be planning
buildings in which future recreation programs will be car-
ried on. (This discussion of buildings, especially those for
which recreation administrators have primary responsibility,
will be continued in the September, 1959, issue of RECREA-
TION.—E(l.) #-

 

HAVE YOU TRIED . . .

This New Idea in Diving Boards?

“The first new idea in diving since
the springboard,” the Cheudelle Diving
Board, has been granted a patent by
the US. Patent Office. Conceived by
Charles E. Planck, public information
officer of the Civil Aeronautics Admin-
istration in Anchorage, Alaska, the
board takes its name from chandelle,
the French term for a climbing, ISO-de-
gree turn by an airplane. The inventor
spells it with three E’s, “with apologies
to the French.”

The board is like a third of a hoOp
twisted and banked upward and out-
ward over the water to a height of ten
or fifteen feet. It starts at the edge of
a pool or the edge of a diving platform
over a lake, and always curves over the
water. The diver runs as far up the
curved slope as his strength, traction,
' and centrifugal force will allow and
then dives or falls into the water.

“What dives, maneuvers, tricks° or

236

contests may be developed on the Chen-
dclle is anybody’s guess,” Mr. Planck
says in discussing use of the board.
“The Optimum curve is yet to be deter-
mined by actual test of a prototype, hut
I can picture vigorous youngsters per-
forming as many ingenious and novel
entries into the water from this appara-
tus as they nowperforin from the spring-
board. It is possible that a new style of
precision diving competition will come
from this design.”

Optimum curvature and climb of the
board are such that it will be attractive
for use by all ages of swimmers. The
young and the old may not be able, or
desire, to go very far up before diving
off into the water. Those of more vigor,
Planck believes, will try to get all the
way to the end of the board, which
should be so designed as to be always
a bit more than the best can conquer.

“Engineers are stumped in figuring

 

what this curvature and climb should
be,” the inventor said. “The strength
and speed of a diver are not in the for-
mula books, and without these elements,
centrifugal force, and traction cannot
be computed. lt will take some cutting
and trying to arrive at the Optimum
curve. Thereafter, the board can be fac-
tory made and installed without special
skill. Railings will prevent the user from
falling anywhere but into the water, and
the bracing structure need not interfere
with use of pool or (living tower. The
board can be made of metal, plywood,
or fiberglass, with suitable nonskid
covering.”

if it were then defeated, couneilmen
could be held liable for all costs in-

This was not completely true, but at
any rate, the city council did not choose
to finance the special vote in any way.
It fell to Donald Maxey of the VFW,
and the VFW, to recruit volunteer poll
workers, to obtain free use of polling
places, and to raise funds with which to
print the ballots. As it turned out, rec-
reation superintendent Jim Shepherd
remained home from the Philadelphia
NRA Recreation Congress that year, to
guard against any possible failures.

He and others recruited additional
poll workers late the night before the
election, to fill sudden vacancies.

In the overall campaign, Jim called
on political and youth-serving organi-
zations to help out. He organized a
personal committee, representing teen-
agers, PTA playground committees,
Greater Morgantown baseball organi-
zations, Boy Scouts, Junior Deputies,
the local youth center, politicians, and
the VFW Auxiliary.

A comic-strip cartoon, prepared by
talented baseball leader Richard Brown,
was printed by the hundred. The day

before the election, PTA committees
helped deliver these comic strips to all
elementary-school boys and girls. The
student council at St. Francis High
School made speeches at the school
general assembly; and members of pub-
lic-speaking classes at the Morgantown
junior-high school also gave talks be-
fore each class in the school, urging
students to get their parents out to

radio station WA] R lent its voice to the‘

and lay members, headed by a council-
man; an untold number of volunteers
made speeches; others turned artist and

lished.

All of this sounds as though the teen-
age campaign for a swimming pool was
a pushover but, seen in the light of the

earlier defeat three years ago and in the
failure of other special elections for
civic improvements, their victory is all
the more impressive.

Another campaign had to be waged
again the next spring, when it became
apparent that the special-levy money
would not be available until the end of
the ~three years. A bond issue was
presented to the voters in June, the
bonds to be paid for by the levies. City
couneilmen and the Reverend W. Roy

' Hashinger, president of the consolida-

ted recreation commission, urged pass-
age of the bond issue so the pool could
be constructed a ‘little earlier. The
honds were passed by a greater percent-
age than the swimming pool levies.
The new Morgantown swimming
pool, known as the War Memorial Pool,
thus came into being, and was opened
to the public on Memorial Day, 1958.
This beautiful, modern pool did not
just happen—it is the result of the com-
bined efforts of the city council, the
citizens, the schools, and the mass com-
munications media-——all goaded into ac-
tion by an enthusiastic group of young
people. determined to get what they
needed—a swimming pool. #

EMERGING TRENDS IN RECREATION

Facts from field reports . . .

EVELOPMENTS in the recreation
D field during 1958 are revealed in
the annual report of the National
Recreation Association Field Depart-
ment, as based on individual reports of
the Association’s district representa-
tives; and it is a fascinating document.
Eighty-two new year-round recrea-
tion departments, for instance, were
established in 1958, the largest number
-—-——twenty-eight—being in the Great
Lakes District. The Middle Atlantic and
Southern Districts reported fifteen each.
General progress in the extension and
quality of program activities and serv-
ices is evident. However, in some cities,
and in a few states, the level of program
and leadership as a whole, is percep-
tively low. Major emphasis on physical
activities and on development of new
areas and facilities too often resulted

238

in lack of attention to the building of a
more varied and better balanced recrea-
tion program.

Notable improvement in scope of pro-
gram content was made in Indiana. This
trend is significant because, in the past,
athletics dominated the state’s local pro-
grams. Progress in 1958 included pro-
vision of additional activities for vari-
ous age groups. Even athletics and
games competition were extended to
include women’s and girls’ leagues and
older men’s teams, under modified play-
ing rules. The employment, for the first
time, of more than twenty assistant
superintendents and top supervisors,
additions by local departments of
twenty Specialists in arts and crafts,
music, drama, dance, and outdoor edu-
cation, all mean better programs.

Other areas also show growth of pro-

gram and leadership. Services to senior
citizens continue to expand, new centers
and programs for this age group being
provided in an increasing number of
communities across the country. Mil-
waukce, Wisconsin, is now providing a
valuable counseling program on pre-
retirement planning.

Family recreation is growing in popu-
larity, with services to family campers
increasingly being offered by municipal
recreation departments. Statewide pro-
grams to serve family groups are prob-
ably more general in New Hampshire
than elsewhere. Michigan communities
are giving much more attention to out-
door education and family camping.
Green Bay, Wisconsin, conducts good
family programs in the local parks, us- 1
ing picnic areas, the zoo, beach, and
marina. Other Wisconsin cities are also
extending family recreation programs.

The number of recreation depart-
ments providing services for the ill and

RECREATION

handicapped increases, with many more
administrators waking up to the needs
of these special groups. Camping for
the mentally retarded and other handi-
capped is growing.

 

Among cultural programs reported,
the Waterloo, Iowa, recreation depart-
ment conducts diversified activities of
this type, in the NRA Midwest District,
Ind boasts a district art council. In the
Middle Atlantic District more cultural
activities seem to he flourishing in New
Jersey than in the other states.

DIFFERENT forms of drama activities

are springing up in communities
that never had them before, and enlarg-
ing in others. They are increasing in

iana and Ohio, with children’s thea-
rs, summer theaters, community thea-

ter groups, and a growing number of

There has been a great upsurge in the
' of water areas in the Southern and
reat Lakes Districts. Activities at
ches, city water reservoirs, and lakes
ave multiplied. Boating is popular in
lnmst every Florida city with a shore-
ine. The Pram, a small sailboat, is
n in all such towns. Boating and
ter skiing are increasing in Georgia
ities. Marinas are multiplying in the
outhern and Great Lakes areas.

Swimming has increased in all parts
f the country, especially where the
limate is conducive to outdoor swim-
ing. This acceleration has followed
extensive construction of outdoor
ools, heaches, and other facilities. It

as been, perhaps, greatest in the South.

AMONG other interesting miscellane-

0115 program activities reported
during the year are Christmas work-
shops, gun safety programs, Recreation
Month recognition dinners and other
activities, charm schools, baton twirl-
ing, talent shows, Christmas Villages,
sugarin’-off parties, outstanding doll
shows in Corpus Christi, Galveston, and

Texas City, Texas, and fencing instruc-
tion.

There was a general increase in oper- ‘

ating budgets, countrywide, in 1958, as
has prevailed during the last six years.
The overall average range of the in-
crease was approximately the same as
reported for l957—ten to twenty per
cent. A somewhat higher percentage of
the total cities reporting enjoyed in-
creases, an outstanding example being
the budget of Bristol, New Hamphire—-—
a small town of fifteen hundred peeple.
Its total recreation budget was increased

from $8,000 to $15,000. The town’s ad-
visory council accomplished this by
means of a dynamic program of pub-
lic education prior to a town meeting.

Leading the list of new recreation
facilities are parks, playgrounds, rec-
reation buildings, and swimming pools,
reported in that order. High on the list
also are fieldhouses and shelter build-
ings, tennis courts, multiple-use areas,
and lighted courts and playing fields.

In some sections of the country, the
economic recession discouraged the
holding of elections for recreation bond
issues and tax levies or was a factor in
the defeat of some such issues and lev-
ies. However, bond issues were ap-
proved by sixty communities in eight-
een states. Special tax levies for recrea-

tion were voted by twenty-two commun-
ities in tcn states. Bond issues were pre-
dominantly for swimming pools; next
in order were park and recreation areas
and reereation buildings.

The NRA (listriet representatives-3' re-
ports indicate much the same rate of
gradual improvement as in 1957, in the
calihre of full-time employed recreation
leadership—as applied to executive and
supervisory personnel rather than to
lower staff levels. More than usual
gains were made in Florida, Ohio, Con-
neeticut, and New Hampshire. States
which now have some form of certifica-
tion systcm include Arizona, California,
Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, a n d
Texas.

Training of local recreation leaders
throughout the country was more exten-
sive than in any other year. Preseason
and weekly meetings of playground
workers is accepted practice among
more year-round recreation depart-
ments. Increasingly, these provide some
opportunity for in-service training of
full-time employees. More numerous
and productive of good results were the
variety of training programs promoted
and conducted by many of the state rec-
reation societies and associations, state
recreation departments or consultants,
colleges and universities. These have
been institutes, workshops, and special
sessions, many for training of activities
skills. State and district conferences
and the National Recreation Congress
are regularly providing more Special
training sessions in which both paid and
volunteer leaders participate. Every-
where interest in various types of lead-
ership training is more evident.

HOW TO PRESENT
A WATER SHOW

Doris Layson Bullock and Joan Sanders

EADERS OF community recreation swimming programs
Lare often faced with the problem of putting on an en-
tertaining water show, using individuals whose aquatic
skills vary from beginning to advanced. .All too often, the
result is a disconnected series of acts, failing to sustain the
interest of either spectators or participants.

Many such problems can be solved by selecting a theme
and then developing each number around it. The frequently
used circus and travelogue themes allow for participation,
regardless of age, sex, or skill. A theme also suggests pos-
sible musical accompaniment, costuming, propertics, and
publicity. lf participants, individually, and through group

leaders, share in its planning and development, there will

overture of a musical, was vivid and colorful. Sixteen swim-
mers, wearing bright red-and-white suits and red caps, us-
ing flutter boards decorated with big red-and-white plastic
pompoms to form patterns, moved throughout the entire area
of the seventy-five-hy-forty-foot pool. Swimming strokes
and their variations were featured in this act. To provide
visual contrast, but still continuing the “happy” mood, the
next number, Methegiin", used an RCA record entitled “Old
Timers’ N ite at the POps,” and involved only four swimmers.
Two wore pink-and-red striped leotards, with black opera
hose, and two wore black leotards and hose. All wore black
cotton caps. Those in the black leotards were made up with
huge black mustaches. A fifth girl, dressed as an old-

sibility, initiative, and other qualities contributing to each
individual’s overall education and development.

The Show Itself

Potpourri, a water show planned and presented by the
Terrapin Club of the University of Illinois, was a theme
show, developed from an apparently unrelated series of
ideas. The basic problem was to plan a program that would
give club members the chance to demonstrate, in an cnter:
taining way, the different skills learned in class. This idea,
plus such factors as color, variety, harmony, were used as
reference points throughout the planning stage.

As the show was to be given in an indoor pool, with no
temperature or humidity controls for the spectator area,
one hour was set for the performance. Each club member
was assigned to swim in no more than two numbers. As-
signments were made after evaluating capabilities and in-
terests of each swimmer. Each number was so designed
that the specific skills demonstrated in it would be different
from those performed in the others. Locations of the per~
formers’ entrances and exits onto the deck stage area and
into the water were varied as much as possible.

Commencer, the opening number, corresponding to the

fashioned clown, introduced the number with a satirized
soft-shoe routine on the deck, in a space away from the
entry area of the other four, and closed it in the same man-
ner. The swimmers carried out the theme by mimicking,
in clown fashion, the strokes and stunts of the preceding
and following numbers.

The next number, Experiments in Water Sounds, de-
veloped from the directors’ desire to try a relatively unusual
technique. Fourteen swimmers, located in a darkened pool,
in an area not visible to most of the audience, and led
hy two dancer-conductors, used kicks, swishes, slaps, and
flicks to create sound patterns of different rhythms and
intensities. The audience was specifically directed by a
program note to listen “with the eyes closed” to this num-
ber. Only a short swim, the width of the pool from place
of entry to area of performance, was involved, thus only
elementary swimming skill was required. A number such as
this could be done in shallow water with nonswimmers.

Sketches in C oior and Line used asymmetrical formations
of seven swimmers. Wearing dark-blue suits and artist-type
berets, decorated with multicolored polka dots, the swim-
mers executed stunts and strokes requiring intermediate
skill. For most of the number, only the center three-quarters
of the pool was used, but the V-pattern swimming forma-
tion, ending the number, utilized the entire length of the
pool. Variants of curved and straight lines were used.

tumcd in black and white, was scheduled at this point in
the program, to emphasize the contrast between this, the
preceding, and following numbers in types of music. swim-
mers, colors, and skills shown. lt was entitled flue-tan,
meaning “coqucttc.”

ln Kaleidescope, twelve swimmers executed spokcd-whccl,
elongated-star, and raft-floating formations to the gay music
of the Carousel lf’aftz. The swimmers wore solid-colored
suits of coral, aqua, or white, and worked in groups of
four. The formations were planned so colors, as well as the
bodies of the swimmers, formed interesting patterns. This
spectacular diSplay number was the show’s high point.

Fancy and clown diving, and diving in ultraviolet light,
introduced the second half of the program. Divers wore re-
fleeting suits and caps; and the edges, take-off point, and
end of the board were marked with reflecting tape. The
blacklight diving led directly into the next number, Zerfek,
whose title was taken from the music's. Wearing reflecting
suits (a supply of which the club keeps in its costume lock-
er), and caps with antennae, and with their elbows, wrists,
and ankles bound with reflecting tape, the swimmers ex-

 

ecuted a composition including stunts, strokes, and floats.
Such suits can be used in surface dives, dolphins, and some
other stunts, but the effect is dulled, so most of the work
was kept at or just under the water surface.

For V i'tesse, four swimmers dressed in yellow suits and
caps and donned swim fins to do a fast-moving act. They
usually performed as a group of four, but occasionally di-
vided into two groups of two each. With the exception of
the use of the tub, corkscrew, shark, and oyster, no stunts
were used, since swim fins more often hinder than help in
stunt acts. Emphasis in this was on rapid, flowing move-
ment, and coverage of the entire pool. By the end of it, the
group had completed a huge figure-eight pattern.

Advanced stunt skills, a small group of five, and a change
in pace and type of music dictated the planning of the
Trajectories composition. The entire group started with

the music and worked together for about three phrases.
Then three swimmers waited at one side of the pool while
two did a brief duet. Joining together again, the entire
group completed the composition, sometimes working as a
group of five, sometimes working in opposition, in groups
of three and two. The pool pattern was designed in an
attempt to capture the modern, abstract feeling of the music.

The soloist in Phoenix wore a blue-and-grecn-sequined
suit and cap, for a vivid color splash, and Spotlights of the.
same hues enhanced the brilliance of these colors. The ex-
ecution of advanced stunt skills and the strong, flowing
movement provided additional contrasts.

Melange, the finale, was, like the introduction, a large,
lively, colorful routine, involving relatively simple swim-
ming skills. The sixteen performers moved rapidly from
one pattern to another. The routine was finished as the en-
tire group gathered in a long line at one side of the pool,
head to wall, hands holding the gutter, and feet working
in a large thundering flutter kick. The spray screen thus
created served as a frame for the swimmers from other
numbers in the show, who came out onto the deck displaying

a “Good Night” sign and waving to the audience. The show
ended with the dimming of flood and spotlights.

A water show such as Potpourri can be adapted to fit
the needs and objectives of a community recreation swim-
ming program. Beginning swimmers could do a number
comparable to Experiments in Water Sounds. Men, using
the ideas in V itesse, could devel0p a powerful, impressive
routine. A floating number, such as Kaleidoscope, is ideal
as a final project for a class of older women. For those with
a flair for comedy, .‘lfetheglin could serve as a model. A
carefully planned finale can make use of all the participants.

Throughout the planning of a theme water show, try to
use all available talent, but strive for color, variety, and
harmony. The resulting production, limited only by the
creative ability of the group, should be an entertaining and
satisfying experience for both audience and swimmers. #

CONSIDER THE

A recreation program designed
to discourage fireworks and
promote family recreation.

Ralph Borrelli

FOURTH OF JULY

OR GENERATIONS, Americans have considered the Fourth
of July, the anniversary of the adoption of the Declara-
tion of Independence, as the most joyful of all secular

holidays. Paradoxically, this celebration has been causing
more and more grief as the ringing bells, marching bands,
and oratory of yesterday have given way to a parade of ac-
cidents, leaving injury and death in their wake.

Less than one hundred years after celebration of the
Fourth began, patriotic demonstrations were supplanted by
dangerous fireworks, which, each year, brought injury to
thousands. Early in this century, many states began to legis-
late against the manufacture and sale of fireworks, and,
gradually, “safe and sane” Fourth of July fireworks demon-
strations became the rule rather than exception.

Now, an even greater danger has arisen—families have
taken to their automobiles. Crowded highways, reckless
driving, and continued use of illicit fireworks exact a tragic
toll on what should be a happy day. Thus, the celebration
of Independence Day has brought misery to a shocking num-
ber of Americans.

In 1955, the Los Angcles city fire department proposed
to the city recreation and park department that it cosponsor
Fourth of July celebrations, designed not only to dis-
courage individuals from shooting illegal fireworks on front
lawns and in public streets, but also to plan programs that
would revive old-fashioned, family-style community celebra-
tions.

The first year, trial programs were held at four recreation
centers. Activities included races, games, picnicking, and
approved fireworks displays at night.

50 successful were the initial programs, that the next
year the number of celebrations was increased to ten, and
interest skyrocketed to the extent that, in 1957, the city
council made a special appropriation of six thousand dollars
to be used for fireworks displays at twenty centers, with the
understanding that at least one celebration be staged in each
of the fifteen councilmanic districts.

Once again, the programs were so popular that the city
council increased the special appropriation to seventy-five
hundred dollars for thirty recreation areas in 1958. Record-
breaking attendance of nearly three hundred thousand peo-
ple enjoyed the all-day observances.

In four years, the cosponsoring departments learned a
great deal, helpful to future programs. Local service clubs,
chambers of commerce, businessmen’s groups, the police
department, the city bureau of music. and other organiza-

tions, are cooperating to make Fourth of July in Los Angeles
a community venture. In planning, recreation directors
schedule joint meetings of leaders from various organiza-
tions in their communities. Committees are formed to
supply leadership for certain features of the programs, in-
cluding fund raising; coffee and soft drinks; entertainment
or platform stunts; picnic races; speakers, and other neces-
sary activities.

In raising funds, local chambers of commerce, business-
men’s associations, and service clubs are willing contribu-
tors to the fireworks display fund. Each center raises a
minimum amount among service clubs and citizen groups,
to supplement the funds appropriated by the city council.
The fire department has found, from past experience, that
a forty-five-minute fireworks diSplay makes an ideal cele-
bration.

Directors also like to choose events to include the entire
family. In some communities, these programs start in the
morning, in others, at noon; and in still others, it is ad-
visable to start in late afternoon. Starting time depends
on the facilities and interest of the community. In most
instances, if the weather is warm, it is best to start pro-

grams after the picnic dinner in the early evening.
A Typical Program

0 Morning: Picnic games and races, ball games, father-
and-son and mother-and-daughter activities, family picnic
lunches.

o Afternoon: Picnic games and races, father—and-son ball
games, volleyball for mothers and daughters.

0 Evening: Family picnic dinners, platform entertainment,
concerts, speeches, fireworks display.

A flag-raising ceremony is usually conducted at the start
of each program, and a member of the city council is invited
to give a short Independence Day talk.

Where possible, directors plan concerts. In some com-
munities, lodges and other organizations are willing to
take part. Local high-school bands sometimes are available,
but arrangements for them must be made before the summer
school vacation begins. The evening fireworks displays are
most important. Under most conditions, they are set up
in the outfield of a ball diamond, so that they can be viewed
from the bleachers, where spectators are protected by fences.
In a few instances, displays are placed on park lakes. Suit-
able fireworks, complying with state, county, and city regu-
lations, are furnished at special rates by private vendors.
For safety purposes, they are delivered and set up by recre-
ation and park department maintenance crews. The follow-

department arranges for some of its personnel to apply for
such licensing. Personnel from the maintenance division
of the recreation and park department c00pcrate with the
firemen, who have charge of touching off the displays. These
men are experts, trained at in-service courses, where they
leam proper set-up and CXplOSiOtt techniques. Fire depart-
mcnt and maintenance personnel also investigate each play-
ground and suggest proper safety measures to be used in
connection with the program. To avert congested traffic and
assure proper policing, the patrol bureau of the police dc-
partment alerts each police division iniarcas where celebra-
tions are held and each playground director contacts his

local police precinct, notifying them of time and so on.

Thus, Los Angeles has truly made the observance of [n-
dependence Day a community venture. Various city depart-
tncnts and community service organizations, working to-
gether, have made Fourth of July a day when families en-
joy getting togcthcr in their own communities, to perpetuate

had stayed level, with sand or gravel
filling the space between the planks;
and none had to be reset or levclcd.
Seven of the new-type ramps have
now been installed in the state’s parks.

Clubs contemplating building their
mm launching ramps, or a proposal to
their local government to have one
built for their community, may find
“just what they're looking for” in a
design created by the State of Wash-
ington’s Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion. The commission wanted a launch-
ing ramp that would be low in construc-
tion cost; low in maintenance costs; and
able to withstand wave actions, currents,
and tides without damage.

The solution devised by the commis-
sion’s engineers is a ramp made of
)refabricated, reinforced concrete
“planks.” The planks are cast in forms
at a convenient location and then hauled
to the launching site on a flat-bed
truck equipped with an overhead mono-
rail and chain hoist. At the site, they

‘are fastened together with galvanized
. l straps. This type of construction
allows the installation of any desired
length since any number of planks may
be joined together.
Clubs considering the construction
.of this type of ramp could find trucks
of the design used to transport the
‘fhnks by contacting companies that
Ihpccializc in hauling large, heavy ob-
jects such as septic tanks or cut stone.

  
   

can 1959

Forms for the pouring of the concrete
planks are of simple construction. Wood
is used for the walls and corrugated
metal for the bottom. (The corrugated
metal provides a nonskid surface on
the planks, to give good traction to car
tires.) Each plank is four inches thick,
fourteen inches wide, and ten feet long.

The commission reports an examina-
tion of four ramps of this type, installed
last year, showed that there had been
no washouts or under-cutting; planks

Two tnore are planned in the near fu-
ture, and the commission reports more
will be constructed as “time and fi-
nances permit.”

The commission also reports that the
ramps are being “enthusiastically” re-
ceived by the boating public. The Brit-
ish Columbia Department of Recreation
and Conservation has installed one in

Design Contest Winners

The judges paced back and forth
contemplatively, trying to decide which
of the seventy-seven entries in the first
annual Recreation Design Contest, co-
sponsored by the National Recreation
Association and The Art School of Pratt
Institute, Brooklyn, New York should
receive prizes. Choice was not easy
on this hot, sticky May 20; it was diffi-
cult to pick the winners from the many
fine posters, paintings, and one mobile.

After some close voting, in which a
tie had to be broken, the first prize of
one hundred dollars went to John Frai-
oli of New Rochelle, New York; second

Mad Tea Party in Central Park

At a ceremony presided over by
commissioner of parks Robert Moses,
Central Park in New York City became
adorned by another statue, based on the
Mad Tea Party from Alice in Wonder-
land. It was given to the city’s children
by the George and Margarita Delacorte
Foundation, in memory of the late
Margarita Delacorte. George Delacorte,
Jr., whose grandchildren unveiled the
statue, said to the youngsters milling
around among the several hundred
spectators on the beautiful sunny May
day, “Climb on it, play around it. It’s
all yours!”

Handel and the Volnnteer

The National Recreation Association
has given a citation to Mrs. Rose M.
Singer for “her outstanding contribu-
tion to music in the field of recreation”
because of her work with the Depart-
ment of Commerce and Public Events,
in behalf of New York City’s Handel
Festival. Mr. Prendergast presented
the award to her at Association head-
quarters, pointing out that she had been
nominated for the citation by both the

New York City Symphony and the Po-
lice Athletic League. This is one more
example of increasing public interest
and participation in the cultural arts.

Mrs. Singer recruited and supervised
a team of volunteers which took care
of publicizing the Handel Festival via
various organizations, schools, and so
on. (See article on page 214.)

Golden Anniversary Salutes

0 Back in 1909, the California cities
of Oakland and Berkeley inaugurated
their first municipal recreation depart-
ments. These started with a couple of
playgrounds and developed, over the
years, into two very active and large-
scale recreation Operations. Both cities
are celebrating their fiftieth anniversary
with appropriate celebrations, taking
place at various intervals throughout
the year. Happy birthday!

0 Congratulations to Hamilton, 0n-
tario, Canada, are in order! They have
an enviable record of fifty years of play-
grounds to their credit, started back in
1908, at the instigation of the Local
Council of Women. The Hamilton lice-
reation Commission has put out a book-
let to commemorate this anniversary
and mentions some of the people who
have been helpful in one way or another.

Recreation Recruitment

Recreation recruitment kits have been
made up for all high-school counsclors
in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Recrea-
tion Association executive board felt
that the time had come for professional
recreation workers and guidance coun-
o lors to work together, diseuss mutual
problems, and thus arrive at a better
understanding of recreation as a pro-
fession. ln towns not having a recrea-
tion director, kits will be mailed direct-
ly to the guidance counselors. Addition-
al material can be obtained from the

Secretary, 461 North 35th Street, Mil-

Help for Delinquents

Philadelphia is attempting this spring
and summer to help rehabilitate, by
healthful outdoor work, fifty boys be-
tween sixteen and eighteen who have
had skirmishes with the police and
the courts. Conccived by the city’s
Youth Conservation Commission and
patterned after the Civilian Conserva-
tion Corps back in the 1930’s, the pro-
gram will put them to work, keeping
Fairmount Park clean for fifty cents an
hour. They will work part time during
the school year and full time in the sum-
mer. Substantial hot lunches will be
supplied, in addition to pay.

Welfare commissioner Randolph E.
Wise promised this would not take
work from regular employees.

In “Tenting Tonight,” on page 220 of this issue, the au-
thor discusses some useful camping equipment, here de-
scribed in more detail. Write for further information and
prices to the individual company.

0 A convenient stove and lantern unit, operating on bottled
LP gas tanks, as used in trailers, is now available. One of
the cheapest and most easily handled sources of fuel
and illumination now on the market, this unit also comes
equipped with a heating attachment. A foldaway stove, made
by the same company, weighs six pounds and packs snugly
into an 11” by 51/53” by 5%” metal case, the lid of which
makes an excellent windbreak when the case is open. The
wide and stable mctal grill holds a large frying pan com-
fortably. Write the Turncr Brass Works, 821 Park Avenue,

Sycamore, Illinois.

0 The Umbroiler is a novel
portable barbecue cooker utili-
zing the sun’s rays to broil
your food. Shaped like a para.
bola, it concentrates the sun’s
rays onto a ten-inch square
grill at the focal point. It
weighs four pounds and folds
into a thirty-inch-long by four-
inch-wide carrying case. The
manufacturers states that the
Umbroiler will cook steaks in
fiftecn to twenty minutes and
barbecue hot dogs and ham-
burgers in tcn minutes on a sunny day. For complete infor-
mation, write The Umbroiler Company, 510 Farmers Union
Building. Denver 2, Colorado.

 

° An all-plastic hot
cup resembling a chi-
na teacup, with a han-
dle, is now available
for picnics and family
camping. They are
reusable but can be
thrown away, if de-
sired, because of their
low price. Water can be boiled in them, and all hot drinks
served without the handle’s getting too hot to touch. Com-
ing in packages of fifteen, these cups are ideal for weekend
trips when dishwashing should be kept at a minimum. The
company makes other items, such as packed picnic sets with
throw-away service (all plastic) for four. Write to Federal
Tool Corporation, 3600 West Pratt Boulevard, Chicago 45,

Illinois, for a local source of these useful eating utensils.

 

0 Most materials used to prevent slippery diving boards
are pretty hard on the feet—either very abrasive or supply-

24-8

ing splinters. The makers of Scotch-Tape, the Minnesota

Mining and Manufacturing Company, have developed a re-
silient, nonslip covering, Scotch-Tred, to help overcome

some of these problems. The product is applied easily ( it
has a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing), requires no
maintenance and can be used on solid boards as well as the
slotted professional type. Write the company at 900 Bush
Street, St. Paul 6, Minnesota.

0 Preventive maintenance is a continual headache for al‘
recreation departments, and particularly that of surfaces
exposed to various kinds of corrosion, water, abrasion, and
weathering, and so on. Poly Form, the leading supplicr of
urethane (plastic) coatings, has developed a highly resist
ant, nonirritating, nontoxic, flexible, protective film, whicl
has been rigorously tested, both in the laboratory and alsc
in large chemical and industrial plants, under severe ex‘
posure conditions. The coating can be formulated, to you]
ordcr, to produce either a rigid or a flexible film. It can be
applied to metal, wood, rubber, plastic, concrete, leather
paper, textiles, fabric, glass, ceramics, cork, hardboard, and
practically any other engineering material. From this list
its many rccreation applications are immediately apparent
some of which are boat hulls, pools, showers, floors, out
door furniture, athletic equipment, flooring, sporting goods
and many others. Urethane coatings are said to last four tc
six times longer than conventional coatings; cover up tc
nine hundrcd square feet per gallon; and are unusually re
sistant to hcat, rust, marine corrosion, sun, chemicals, oil
moisture, acids, gases, and abrasion. Poly Form can be
brushed, sprayed, rolled on, or dipped into and is avail
able clear or in colors. Write for complete technical inform
ation and applications, to Poly Form Manufacturing Com

Perspectives on Conservation: Es-
says on America's Natural Resources.
Henry Jorrett, Editor. The Johns Hop-

kins Press, Baltimore 18, Maryland.
Pp. 260. $5.00.

These essays were first presented as
papers at the 1958 Forum of Resources
for the Future, when some of the coun-
try’s foremost experts tackled the re-
source problems of the next fifty years.
The chief contributors were John Ken-
neth Galhraith ( see RECREATION, April,
1959, page 158} , Ernest S. Griffith, Lu-
ther Gulick, Edward S, ‘Mason, Thomas
B. Nolan, and Gilbert F. White. A num-

ber of them touch on the subject of rec-
reation resources, but, generally, they
make for rather dull reading. Too much
is said about what happencd at the Gov-
ernors’ Conference in 1908, but not
enough about the great strides taken
since the mid-Thirties. By looking too
far behind and too far ahead, thc reality
of thc present and the immediate future
ahead are left too vague.

Luther Gulick, however, is good—as
usual. He directs his ammunition at a
real target of specific interest to rec-
reation people. of general interest to
all Americans. He pr0pounds the thesis,
that “urbanization” in and of itself,
as a pattern of life, increases the de-
pendence of our culture on the natural
resources, calling for a reviscd scale of
conscrvation practices.” This increascd
pressure on the land makes possible con-
servation in its fullest sense. A vigorous
program of land conservation and use
must be attained.

The awareness of man to the whole
world of nature and his conviction of
the “moral necessity of sustaining hu-
man life more and more from renewable
resources,” rather than nonrenewable
resources, is imminent.

Action by government must be taken.
This does not mean “initiative on one
level with water, another with land, or
another with open space.” Each of these
functions should, and can, be divided
into “its national, its regional and its
local aspects.” The job cannot be left
solely up to the “technicians, planners,
independent authorities, or bureau-
crats.” The experts could probably

move faster; professionals will be need-
ed at the pr0per time; but little will be
done, and made to stick, unless it fol-
lows national, state, and local demo-
cratic channels.

Planning in a vacuum by those with
no concern for action is a poor base of
Operation. It is equally inadequate to
permit action agcncies to Operate with-
out professional planning assistance.
“Planning as a functionalized activity
need not be at one level, as planning too
can be split into its overall aspects, its
regional aspects, and its local aspects—-
provided we learn to interrelate the
broader and the narrower processes so
as to keep the broad plans realistic and
the local plans consistent.” Sigurd F.
Olson, president of the National Parks
Association, makes an eloquent plea not
only for national parks and forests, but
for “places close at hand, breathing
spaces in cities and towns . . . green
belts, oases among the piles of steel and
stone.” He holds that in divorcing him-
self from the earth, man is “losing con-
tact with clemental and spiritual things,
his sense of oneness with his environ-
ment . . . for which he has been condi-
tioned for a million years.”—Wi1liam
M. Hay, Southern District Representa-
tive, National Recreation Association.

Kites: How to Make and Fly Them,
Morion Downer. lothrOp, Lee and
Shepord, 419 Fourth Avenue, New
York. Pp. 64. $3.00.

The clear diagrams and directions in
this book, illustrated with photographs
and drawings by the author, tell exactly
how to make various types of kites at
minimum expense, how to launch and
fly them, alone or in competition. Kite
flying involves some mishaps and some
losses, but is still lots of fun. An open
field is ideal for the purpose, as is a
wide beach, but city children have to re-
sort to reserved places in parks and
playgrounds supplied by a thoughtful
recreation department, which may also
sponsor kite clubs and competition. Kite
making and flying, an excellent father-
and-son activity, neatly combine arts
and crafts with sports out-of-doors.
