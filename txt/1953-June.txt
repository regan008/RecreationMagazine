RECREATIO

7756/ pm of Emeatfm

What is this

thing called rec-
reation? Have
you ever tried to
define it? It
that
recreation is
whatever you
and I do just for
he pure satisfaction found in the do-
ng———not the work we do for a wage

:r salary in store, oHice or shOp, not

strikes me

 

he chores we perform to keep our-
elves, our homes and our communi-
ies ship-shape, not the schooling by
which we seek the knowledge and skill
recdcd to earn a living.

Sometimes we say that we are go-
ng to do this or that “just for thc fun
.f it.” Is that a valid definition of
ecreation? Almost, but not quite,
mless you include as “fun,” not only
hc bubbly kind, with laughter, but
iso the deeper kind with the warm
.nd lasting glow of inner satisfaction.
llniost any activity may be recreation-
:l. lt all depends on the motive. We
nay play a game, make a garden,
earn a song, or indulge in a life-long
tudy of astronomy. Any of these,
1nd a thousand other things, may be
ecreational activities if pursued for
In alone,———and not for profit, or
lealth, or morality, or any othcr ob-
cctive—no matter how worthy.

How big is recreation? A grcat
.nd growing segment of living! Many
'ears ago the American Federation of
.abor, campaigning against the twelvc
Iour day, adopted the slogan “Eight
{ours Work, Eight Hours Sleep, Eight
fours Recreation.” That was long be-
orc the “five day week” or summer
'and winter?) vacations for all, or
tensions at sixty-five years of age———or
hc thousand and one labor saving

the average person now to dcvote to
“free” activity? I did some figuring
and I couldn’t make recreation time
add up to less 'than 25 per cent—even
after making liberal allowance for
pcrsonal and community “chores” as
well as work, education, sleep, and
so on. Perhaps it is coincidence that
business statisticians report 25 per
cent of the national cash income as
spent for recreation.

How important is recreation? Is
this newly found margin of free time
a kind of unnecded surplus? Is it an
incidental by-product of our increas-
ing efficiency in work and education,
government and the other more seri-
ous and “important” phases” of hu-
man endeavor. Or is recreation a
worthy and superior goal for which
the aches and pains of schooling and
work are endured? Of course, for
many there is joy and great satisfac-
tion in work successfully done. But is
it not also true that, for the vast ma-
jority, work is primarily a means of
getting the money and the time to do
something else —— recreation? Very
many must find in recreation the 0p-
portunity for vital living, for develop-
ing and using personal skills, and for
“being somebody” and “going places”
——for creating something satisfying.

But we need not over-glamorize rec-
reation. Let’s settle for recognition of
recreation as one of the important
phases of well-rounded wholesome liv-
ing in 1953. Let’s not claim that rcc-
reation will make everybody healthy
and moral——even though we often
have seen these “by-product” effects.

Is recreation important to-the com-
munity? In recent centuries we have
organized to build ourselves some
roads and sewers, and running water,
and public schools, and a few other
public services which seem important.
We have figured that by all chipping
in with taxes for some of these ser-
vices we could get them cheaper and
more efiiciently. Well, if we are to
have sports fields and playgrounds,

" :Eitli t()Iri a 1

tennis courts and swimming pools,
and indoor spaces for drama, music,
crafts, and so on, we certainly will
have to chip in with our taxcs and
build these major recreation facilities
as a community project. Only a few
people can afford to join a fully
equipped private recreation club. 50,
we do need ,a good battery of well-
managed public recreation facilities.

How much public management, how
much professional public recreation
leadership do we need? Do we want
to set up a vast public monopoly to
regiment the total recreation time of
our p0pulation into publicly managed
activities and events? Certainly not!
Churches, schools, Scouts, “Y’s,” and
numerous other organizations must be
encouraged to improve and strengthen
the contributions they make to the to-
tal recreation life of our community;
home and family play need to be fos-
tered; legitimate commercial amuse-
ments have a place in the total picture.

It is indeed not surprising that, in
the U.S.A., most wide awake commu-
nities have seen fit to set up some kind
of public recreation board or commis- -
sion. The recreation properties owned
by the community are maintained and
made available for maximum use by
all citizens, young and old. A trained
and experienced professional staff pro-
motes and organizes public recreation
programs with a wide variety of ac-
tivities suited to all agcs and interests.
Recreation now has a voice and an
arm devoted entirely, year in and year
out, to this one large and important
phase of wholesome living in a mod-
ern community. Amid the pressure
for housing, for streets, for parking
spaces, for schools, court houses, for
sewers and other community services,
recreation now speaks up. It must
have its two acres per hundred of pop-
ulation as a fundamental working
foundation for the facilities and the
leaders who are eager to bring to full
fruition the service of community rec-
reation.

A Helping Hand
Sirs: .

I notice from “Letters” in your
March number that Miss Ann Beers, of
the American Baptist Mission, Cau-
hati, Assam, India, needs plans for a
playground, and I am sending you,
with this letter, a set of seven blue-
prints of our model young children’s
playground which . . . I have built
with some help in our district.

I was for several years chairman of
recreation for the British Columbia
Parent-Teachers Association Federa-
tion, and nearly one hundred sets of
these plans have been distributed
throughout the province. Last year a
set was sent to the ladies of the PTA
in Dawson City, in the Yukon, who
wanted to provide playground equip-
ment on the school grounds.

We have used some of the equip-
ment for nine years and it looks as
though it would last for many years
to come. It can he constructed by a
handy man, and has been approved by
experts. »

If you think well of it I wish you
would send this set of blueprints to
Miss Ann Beers, with my best wishes.
It appealed to me very much that there
was only one swing in a city of 80,000,
because I know from experience just
what children get out of such play-
ground equipment.

Also, I have typed out the address
by Dr. Henrietta Anderson, “Recrea-
tion and the Richer Life” which ap-
peared in your January ’53 numher,
and sent it to a couple of Canadian
publications asking them if possible to
'republish it, and to give your maga-
zine the usual credit for it. It is grat-
ifying to have our own Dr. Anderson
who is now honorable secretary for
our Recreation Council receive recog-
mtlon in your magazine. .

My playground, of which I am the
honorary superintendent, has adopted
some ideas from RECREATION and I

am always on the lookout to get fur-
ther ideas from it.

lLOli Council of Greater Victoria,

Baseball School
Sirs:

Your article regarding Phil Riz-
zuto’s baseball school, which was re-
printcd in the Reader’s Digest, has
started us thinking.

_ Possihly we could start and sponsor

a school of this sort here in Glendale.
We now sponsor a little league base-
ball team and feel that movements of

this kind are a great benefit to the
community.

Would you be so kind as to send us

134

 

more information on how this is op-
erated, and any suggestions as to how
we might sponsor this locally? Glen-
dale has several major league baseball
stars who undoubtedly would not he
adverse to making some additional
money for working on a project of
this sort, or—possibly some of them
would be willing, if a program were
set up, to come and help with it.

New Glove for Chris
Sirs:

Your article “A New Glove for
Chris,” in the April 1953 issue of REC-
REATION, and its reprint in the Read-
er’s Digest do great credit to you and
a real service to the cause of sports in
recreation and physical education. We
can refer to the article frequently, and
it makes good reading for undergrad-

uates to help them objectify their pur-
poses.

LEONA HOLBROOK, Women’s Physi-
cal Education, Brigham Young Uni-
versity, Provo, Utah.

Sirs:
I was very pleased to read your ar-

ticle, “A Fielder’s Glove for Chris” by
Keith Jennison, in this April’s Read-
er’s Digest. Such an article makes a
parent “feel” the necessity for clear,
competitive play and teamwork among
all ages and sexes. Recreation in gen-
eral needs more articles like this be-
fore the general reading citizens.

Recruitment of Students

Sirs:

I should like to briefly record my
general reaction to Dr. Tait’s letter tc
thc editors as presented in the May.
1953 issue of RECREATION.

The admittance to the recreation
curriculum of all students who apply
would amount to a confession that we
have learned little regarding methods
of selecting persons for professional
training in recreation. It is true that

RECREATION

today vocational guidance people and
educational psychologists recognize
that an individual may well be suc-
:cssful in an area of occupational en-
tleavor that may encompass a number
of somewhat related positions, and that
the selection of a particular OCCUpation
to the exclusion of all others is not
necessarily the road to vocational suc-
cess. Validity of this fact is attested
by those successful recreation leaders
who transfer to other occupations in
whieh personality and leadership quali-
ties are basic and perform their new
functions with equal success. The re-
verse situation has also been identified
as existing, but in a lesser degree.

If this were Dr. Tait’s thesis he
would find more evidence to advance
it than he can possibly muster to sup-
port his open door policy. In my opin-
ion thc professional training period in
reereation must begin with the best
possible prospective professional ma-
terial. The few years spent in college
cannot develop in an individual the
foundations of personality and leader-
ship skills which should have been de-
veloping in childhood and adolescence.
What the professional training period
can do is to take good raw material
and convert it to a finished product
through the development of broader
skills, enriched personality, expanded
leadership qualities, professional in-
sights, recreation methodology, recre-
alion philosOphy, and understanding
of people.

One cannot quarrel with Dr. Tait’s
observance as to the limitations at-
tached to present selection devices, but
one must disagree as to the impression
of futility which he eXpounds. One
must also reject his inherent proposal
of “trial and error”which he advocates
as superior to use of instruments of
selection.

We at the University of Minnesota
feel that much has been learned about
selection since we first instituted our
curriculum in 1938. Experience gained
in the process of producing over two
hundred degree recipients has given
us mueh evidence to justify our pres-
ent use of selection devices while con-
tinuing to search for and deve10p new
ones and perfecting those in current
usc.

I cannot see that the democratic
principle of “equal opportunity for
all” is abridged in the slightest by a
selection process. Surely Dr. Tait
would not tolerate the principle of
“equal inopportunity” for all which
would inevitably result from unlimited
numbers of admissions where there is
a limited number of faculty.

DR. GERALD B. FITZGERALD, Director

of Recreation Training, University
of Minnesota.

) UNIQUE AMONG SPRING CONFER-
ENCES sponsored by the National Rec-
reation Association, and first of its
kind, was the Southern District Con-
ference on “Recreation in Correctional
Institutions,” held in Roanoke, Vir-
ginia, May 10-11, 1953. Attended by
keenly interested supervisors and su-
perintendents of southern prisons, in-
dustrial farms, state divisions of cor-
rection, this meeting—which came
about through local request—is an en-
couraging straw-in-the-wind. '

) TWO OF TIIE TIIREE PHASES of the
study on Little League, undertaken by
Springfield College, have been com-
pleted. The first phase is a summary
of existing material on the subject; the
second is a survey of Little League
contact men, or representatives, in
forty-four states—to determine their
reaction to Little Leagues. The third
phase is a testing of youngsters who

have taken part in the Little League
tournament.

) THE NUMBER OF NEW RECREATION
DEPARTMENTS established in 1952, ac-
cording to annual rcports from depart-
ment heads and National Recreation
Association field representatives, indi-
cates a growing expansion of the muni-
cipal recreation field. There are seven-
ty-seven new departments, fourteen in
the Middle Atlantic District, two in
New England, thirteen in the Southern,
sixteen in the Great Lakes, twenty in
the Midwest, three in the Southwest,
eight in the Pacific Southwest, one in
the Pacific Northwest. Practically all
were in communities of less than 50,-
000 population. The total number now
served through the association’s field
department is 2,221—981 of these have
full-time, year-round departments, 1,240
are part-time.

The acquisition and deveIOpment of
recreation areas and facilities advanccd
strongly during the past year, with
new and additional playgrounds head-

136

ing the list. Despite federal restric-
tions on critical materials, many com-
munities added indoor recreation build-
ings and centers of various types.

) THE ENTHUSIASM AND INCREASED
NUMBERS of delegates at all district
recreation conferences this spring was
best illustrated in California, by an at-
tendance of 1187 recreation workers.
This conference was jointly sponsored
by the California Recreation Commis-
sion, California Recreation Society and
the National Recreation Association.
The meeting was addressed by Charles
E. Reed, director of the association’s
field department, on “Evidences of the
Need for More Lay Interest and Par-
ticipation in the Planning and DeveIOp-
ment of Community Recreation.”

Delegates at the Midwest Conference
formed committees to do continuing
work throughout the year. The first
lay District Recreation Committee, was
formed in that district and held its
first meeting at the conference. One
of the results of this is the establish-
ment of the new NRA district office, on
the 26th floor of the city hall, Kansas
City, Missouri.

In Kentucky, at the Southern Dis-
trict Conference, the governor of that
state made Joseph Prendergast a Ken-
tucky colonel, despite a waiting list of
5,000, to honor the association for the
work it has done for recreation in
communities in Kentucky.

} ACCORDING TO LATEST AVAILABLE
F ICURES, the Middle Atlantic District
leads all other districts in Affiliate and
Associate Memberships in the National
Recreation Association, with 385 As-
sociate and 198 Affiliate. The Great
Lakes District runs a close second, with

310 Associate and 223 Affiliate Mem-
berships.

ate the work of the past three years and
to plan for the future.

NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ON 26W 2W

THE FORMAL ESTABLISHMENT of a National Advisory

Committee on Recreation Research and the acceptance
of its chairmanship by Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick was re-
cently announced by the executive director of the National
Recreation Association, Joseph Prendergast. In making
the announcement Mr. Prendergast said:

“Recreation has become a major undertaking, involving
the expenditure of vast public and private sums, affecting
the lives of millions of people, and being closely related to
many aspects of modern life. It can go forward only if it
has a solid foundation of scientific facts on which to base
its assumptions and rest its claims for public support. An
advisory committee composed of carefully selected leaders
in the recreation field and in related disciplines will pro-
ridc an effective medium for determining the types of
basic data that should be made available and for develop-
ing effective means of securing them. The association is
extremely fortunate in having Dr. Culick as chairman of
its advisory research committee. It is interesting to note
that Dr. Culick’s uncle, who bore the same name, was the
first president of the National Recreation Association on
its establishment in 1906.”

Mr. Prendergast explained that the National Advisory
Committee on Recreation Research will provide a liaison
between the many agencies, individuals and institutions
throughout the country conducting research relating to
recreation such as colleges and universities, state and na-
tional professional societies and associations, private or-
ganizalions and foundations, and governmental units and
departments. By focusing attention upon fundamental
needs, encouraging the undertaking of studies, guiding
and participating in research projects and helping operat-
ing recreation agencies to benefit from the results of such
research, thc committee can make a valuable contribution
to American life.

The formal establishment by the association of a nation-
al advisory committee on recreation research has been
under serious consideration for several months. Not only
has the board of directors of the association and the asso-
ciation’s staff given considerable thought to the question
of enlarging the association’s research program, but also
the necessity for doing so and for developing a more com-
prehensive plan for research in the field of recreation has
been repeatedly set forth at recent national congresses and
district conferences and urged again and again by the
outstanding recreation leaders of the country.

JUNE 1953

Over a year ago a group of recreation and park execu-
tives and educators adopted thc following statement:

“This group, including municipal recreation executives
and educators, assembled in the office of the National Rec-
reation Association in New York on January 29, 1952, be-
lieves the need for additional recreation research is im-
perative, and recommends that the research department of
the National Recreation Association be strengthened and
expanded to conduct continuous research in critical areas
related to recreation. This group, as a body and individ-
ually, goes on record and pledges continuous support. It
further recommends that the National Recreation Associa-
tion appoint a national advisory research committee.”

Since that meeting the question‘ of membership on the
committee has been discussed with the district representa-
tives of the association and others for the purpose of se-
lecting a representative and well-balanced committee and
choosing the most outstanding research person in the coun-
try as its chairman. Appointments to the committee are
being made from the public park and recreation field on
all three levels of government, from private voluntary
agencies concerned with recreation, from among college
and university educators, from public and private research
organizations, and from the fields of public administration,
to social sciences and other related fields. Mr. George
D. Butler, the association’s director of research, author of
Introduction to Community Recreation and many other
works on various phases of recreation, will serve as the
committee’s secretary. Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick, president
of the Institute of Public Administration of New York,
was the first and unanimous choice for chairman, of all
those consulted.

Dr. Gulick has specialized in government research and
administration all of his life. He has served as counsel to
or on the research staff of legislative commissions and
tax departments'of various states and of New York City.
Among many other important projecfs, he also served as
consultant on post-defense planning to the National Re-
sources Planning Board, 1941-43; on the United States
Census Advisory Committee, 1941-45; as director of the
Office of Organizational Planning of the War Production
Board, 1942-44; as consultant on organization to the
Chairman and General Manager of Smaller War Plants
Corporation, 1944-45.

Dr. Culick-was the Eaton Professor of Municipal Sci-
ence and Administration at Columbia University from

137

1931 through 1942, the Day Lecturer at Union College in
1928-29; lecturer at the University of Buffalo in 1929,
University of Chicago, 1933, University of Pennsylvania,
1936 and the Dodge Lecturer at Yale University in 1933. He
is a member of the American Political Science Association,
American Society for Public Administration, Governmen-
tal Research Association, Tax Association, National Mu-
nicipal League, American Statistical Association, Interna-
tional City Managers’ Association, Municipal Finance Of-
ficers’ Association, and is a fellow of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science. He is the author,
co-author or editor of many outstanding works in the
fields of government, finance and administration.

Mr. James S. Stevens, superintendent of recreation ir
Greenwich, Connecticut, has accepted the v1ce-cha1rman
ship of the committee. Mr. Stevens, who is widely knowr
for his long and effective service in the field of recreation
is also serving as chairman of the Committee on Statistics
for Public Recreation, appointed jointly by the America1
Recreation Society, Community Chests and Councils 0:
America and the National Recreation Association.

A preliminary meeting of a limited number of prospec
tive committee members was held at the Seattle Congress
last autumn, and a full meeting of the new committee anc
sessions on research are being planned for the coming
Philadelphia Congress. Membership will be announced.

RECREATIo!

Tercentenary

The National Recreation Associa-
tion takes pleasure in commemorating,
in this issue of RECREATION, the Ter-
centenary of New York City, 1653-
1953, and in commending the city
park department and board of educa-
tion upon the advancement of“ recrea-
tion through these years.

We share with quiet pride this great
growth in Cotham’s recreation ser-
vices. For nearly fifty of these three
hundred years we have been a part of
this moving forward. For here, as
elsewhere in the nation, the National
Recreation Association message of
“recreation for all, under trained lead-
ership, the year round” has been ac-
ceptcd as public policy.

Here Howard Braucher, in the early
days of the association, gave leader-
ship to the New York City Recreation
Committee. Here the incomparable
Dr. John H. Finley, one of the associ-
ation’s all-time greats, preached the
importance of the city’s providing for
leisure.

Here decade after decade through
special committees, public hearings,
surveys. conferences with public of-
ficials, personnel placements, leader-
ship training projects, program plan-
ning, setting of standards, the full re-
sources of the association have been
made available freely to public and
private agencies and leaders working
with succeeding administrations.

We are proud of the magnificent
park and recreation development that
has come to our nation’s greatest city
and rejoice in the privilege of being a
part of it.

Vandalism—An American Ogre*

Vandalism and its dressed-up twin
-—-—souvenir collecting—know no re-
gional bounds. No state in the Union
is exempt from the pair. Nor can loss
and inconvenience always be stated in
dollars and cents. The Statue of Lib-
erty, now more significant than ever
to a harassed world, suffers the indig-
nity of countless scrawls of names and
initials . . . Washington’s monument
“enjoys” the same distinction.

The abuse of the liberty of a free
country has gone to shocking lengths.
. . . Laws and penalties alone are in-
effective in dealing with the problem.
Education is a valuable tool. So is the
pressure of public opinion. But so
long as the American public disre-
gards vandalism or views it with to-
day’s careless tolerance, just so long
will it continue to cause death, injury,
inconvenience and a heavy bill for
damaged public property.——The Sur-

Editorially Speaking

vey, February 1950.

In their Recreation Round Up for
May, 1952, the Cincinnati Public Rec-
reation Commission writes: “Since
the arrival of spring weather the van-
dalism being done to public facilities
has increased alarmingly. In the last
month, drinking fountains and bench-
es have been demolished, windows
broken, play equipment damaged,
doors and locks ruined,.-..and drain in-
let tops wrecked.

“What kind of boys and girls are
they that will pick up a bench from a
playground and hurl it down a flight
of steps to see it smash? What kind of
adults will these youngsters grow up
to be?

“Whose fault is it that these young
people have so little regard for public
property? Does the failure lie with
the playleader? With the school?
With the church? With the parents?

And more important still, what can be
done to correct the situation?”

The Recreation News of Arlington
County, Virginia, puts it up to the
public as follows:

“Once the public recreation depart-
ment has been established, it becomes
a business organization with all con-
tributing taxpayers as stockholders.
The director of this business is duty-
bound to bring these stockholders the
greatest possible return for their in-
vestment through maximum utilization
of personnel, equipment, buildings,
program and services. The investors.
on the other hand, cannot expect full
returns for their shares unless they
and their families take an active part
in the recreation program.

“The parks, ball fields, and tennis
courts are part of our plan for this
recreation business, and, like most
equipment, they’re expensive. Your
shares of stock pay for them; when
they’re damaged, more shares must go
to repair them. We urge you to re-
member that recreation property is a
part of your business assets.

“Much is written and said about iu-
venile delinquency. Too much. Be-
cause the real problem of so-called dc-

 

linquent youth lies not with the child,
but with his elders.

“Recreation needs the cooperative
efforts of everyone to meet the chal-
lenge of modern life. If we meet it in
our own outlook and set a desirable
pattern for our children, we are mak-
ing a wise investment in the future.”

An up-to-date bibliography of
books, pamphlets, and periodical ar-"
ticles on different aspects of juvenile
delinquency—causes, treatment, pre-
vention, and so on—is available from
the U. S. Children’s Bureau. Requests
for a free copy of “Juvenile Delin-
quency: A Selected Bibliography”

venile Delinquency Project, U. S. Chil-
dren’s Bureau, Washington 25, D. C.

Must \Ve Always Keep Score?

According to an editorial originally
appearing in The Reporter Dispatch,
White Plains, New York, and subse-
que'ntly quoted in the National Edu-
cation fournal, “There’s hardly an ac-
tivity in school in which a child par-
ticipates that he isn’t working toward
some prize or reward, trying to beat
the others, prove himself better than
the rest. It’s true that when he finally
leaves school and enters the business
or professional world he’ll find him-
self working in a competitive atmos-
phere—but, he’ll be far better able to
to compete successfully if, somewhere
along the way, he has developed the
habit of doing some things just for the
sheer fun of it, regardless of the score.

“An authority in child psychology,
speaking to several PTA groups in the
city this year, discussed pressures and
tensions operating in modern society
on adults and on children, too. It
seems ironic that our school system,
instead of working to counteract those
pressures and tensions, in many in-
stances actually helps to create them.

“Have we become a nation so unin-
spired, so lacking in interest and en-
thusiasm that we must always work or
play for a prize? Can’t we ever just
relax and play the game without even
bothering to keep score?”

THE first three hundred years of
New' York City have seen the ex-
pansion of its parks from a few greens
and open spaces to the largest park
recreation system in the world. This
growth has been possible only because
the foresight, long-range planning and
watchfulness of the few have provided
and safeguarded the parks and play-
grounds for the many. This growth
was not steady. Periods of eXpansion
were followed by years when previ-
ously acquired areas were deve10ped
or rehabilitated, or by periods of re-
cession when neglect, restrictions and
even encroachments on park lands
prevented constructive progress. In
order to see how far New York has
traveled along the road of park ad-
vancement, one must look backward.
The city in colonial and post-revo-
lutionary years had but three parks—

Battery, City Hall and Bowling Green.
Life, except for the favored few, was
hard and serious. Long hours of work
left little time for amusements or rec-
reation.

Although youngsters in-

dulged in simple childhood games,

adult recreation was found more often
in a change of occupation than in con-
tests or entertainment, e.g. hunting
was both recreation and a source of
livelihood. Parades, concerts by mili-
tary bands, and firework displays in
the three parks were events of unusual
note and bowling on the green the
only “sport” as such. Vast undevel-
oped lands and uncontaminated waters

surrounding the city offered unlimited"

opportunities for outdoor recreation
and obviated the need for parks and
playgrounds.

As the city eXpanded, no particular
thought or planning was devoted to

PARK SYSTEM

the acquisition of land for parks, with
a result that later the only areas avail-
able for conversion to such purposes,
within the city, were the old parade
grounds, market places, and burial
grounds. As late as the 1860’s only
slightly more than one thousand acres
had been set aside as park areas.

Our city fathers did not conceive
that the future greatness of the city
in matters of commerce might also
depend upon maintaining the spacious
and agreeable qualities which go with
ample recreation facilities. The corn-
1nission which in 1811 prepared the
Plan of Manhattan had mapped a
number of the city’s squares but ne-
glccted to provide parks, not fore-
seeing the intensive development
which was to cover the city with
buildings and cut off community ac-
ccss to the waterfront.

RECREATION

Between 1830 and 1850 the popu-
ation of the city had more than dou-
)led. Construction of houses to hold
he most tenants in the smallest pos-
ible space, without providing breath-
ng spaces, created noxious slums.
:emeteries and the few existing parks
llld squares, the only grassy places
pen to the public, were crowded on
Sundays and holidays. On Saturdays,
JOYS “were allowed to play ball and
rther games” in Battery Park.

Public clamor for a new and larger
hark became so insistent that by 1850
)oth mayoral candidates pledged
hemselves to do something about this
iroblem. A 760-acre tract of land
was acquired in 1853 for Central
Iark, the first New York park to be
lid out upon well-defined lines ac-
rording to a carefully conceived plan.

Large as it was (double the area of
be then existing parks) Central Park
lid not meet the needs of the growing
:ity. Although many city officials felt
‘one park was quite enough” the lat-
er half of the nineteenth century
)rought about an extension of the
:ity’s park domain through the ac-
{uisition not only of Prospect Park,
Dcean and Eastern Parkways, and
)ther smaller areas in Brooklyn, but
also of land for n0rtherly parks such
is Van Cortlandt, Pelham Bay, Bronx,
Irotona, Claremont and St. Mary’s
Parks, and the Bronx-Pelham, Mosh-
)lu, and Crotona Parkway lands, to-
aling an area five times that of Cen-
.ral Park. These northerly areas were
naccessible owing to lack of transpor-

tation facilities, but it was the pur-
pose of the city administration to
maintain them in their natural state
and preserve them for the use of pres-
ent and coming generations. Sound
wisdom was also used in laying out
Pelham Bay Park so that it would in-
clude an extensive shorefront. This
was then outside the city limits but
today it is the largest recreation area,
over 2,100 acres, in the densely pop-
ulated borough of the Bronx.

No great attention was devoted to
the crowded tenement house district
in the lower portion of the city, al-
though Corlears Hook and Mulberry
Bend parks were built to replace some
of the squalid tenements.

The changing times and the chang-
ing face of the city_afiected the recre-
ational pursuits of its citizens, which
in turn influenced planning for public
recreation. Parks were no longer
merely places for walking and relaxa-
tion. In the 1870’s activities such as
boating, baseball, cricket, lacrosse
croquet, archery, skating, curling and
lawn tennis were being played, and
concerts were scheduled regularly. In
Central Park, ball-grounds had been
set aside for boys and girls, a movable
skate house, a curling house, and the
Kinderberg, a rustic shelter for small
children, had been built. A “few ar-
rangements for amusing and taking
care of children” had been placed
within easy reach and at the Dairy
simple refreshments were sold at mod-
erate cost.

By 1900 parks and playgrounds

 

comprised 3.6 per cent of the total
area of the city. In 1902 Seward Park
was completed—the first playground
to be provided with recreational
equipment. It contained a children’s
playground, a gymnasium ground, a
nine-lap track, lawns and walks. The
playground was equipped with swings,
giant strides, teeter ladders, sand
courts and facilities for games. The
gymnasium ground had many pieces
of apparatus for climbing, vaulting
and other forms of gymnastic exercise.
Boxing equipment and basketball
goals were also provided. An arcaded
pavilion had bathing facilities, locker
rooms and comfort stations on the
lower floor and a large recreation
room on the main floor. Temporary
sash enclosures were erected in cold
weather to permit year-round use of
this room. Although this park was
used as a model for parks in other
sections of the city, in a few decades
its design was out-of-date.

Although- slum clearance was some-
what advanced during this period and
some neighborhood rehabilitation was
brought about by arterial and park-
way development, recreational facili-
ties were totally inadequate and in
many instances were actually deteri-
orating. It was one of the tragedies of
New York life that its boundary
waters were in large measure de-
stroyed for recreational purposes. “
Haphazard maritime and commercial
development made picnicking, fishing,
and boating unattractive. An anti-
quated sewage system made bathing

dangerous. Facilities at adjacent
ocean beaches were monOpolized and
misused by private concessionaires
who took whatever the traffic would
bear from the sweltering thousands
seeking relief from New York’s un-
bearable mid-summer heat.

Few playgrounds had
shrubbery to beautify the site. Though
many parks preserved existing beau-

trees or

tiful features, they were not acquired
as integral parts of a clearly defined,
comprehensive scheme. Completely
overlooked was the fact that neighbor-
hood parks retain and sometimes ex-
pand their usefulness even after the
character of the neighborhood changes
as, for example, in Battery Park. Lack
of correlation and continuity of plan-
ning and development there resulted
in mistakes which could not be reme—
died without long lapse of time and
great expense.

Mistakes of the past served in some
degree as warning to those who 0p-
posed acquisition of land-while it was
still reasonable in cost. Considerable
additions of land and facilities were ac-
quired but, although park lands by
1925 comprised 5.3 per cent of the
total city area, park planning was
based on an obsolete local basis which
completely neglected
many neighborhoods. A sensible and

In 1933, the five separate borough
park departments were consolidated
under one commissioner who was per-
mitted to act as head of the state park
system and to hold other unsalaried
offices to facilitate coordination of city
and state park, parkway, arterial, and
related developments. New York

During his nineteen years in office, the
park system has achieved the greatest
growth in the history of public recre-
ation.

The number of playgrounds has in-
creased from 119 to 584:. Park lands
nearly doubled from 14,000 acres in

partments or from the state; on land
acquired by slum clearance, gift, pur-

there are 16.5 miles of beaches Op-

new beaches to be developed will add
some five miles to the system. A 3200,-
000,000 program for the completion of
a modern sewage disposal system is
well under way and by 1959 pollution
of all boundary waters will be a thing
of the past.

In 1934 there eight golf

courses, three of which had only nine

during inclement weather, the recrea-
tion program at many outdoor areas
has been curtailed by lack of indoor
facilities. Three indoor recreation cen-
ters are in Operation today. The larg-
est and first to be designed for the
purpose is the $1,200,000 St. Mary’s
Park Center which has an indoor
swimming pool, gymnasium, game
rooms, arts and crafts, manual train-
ing and domestic science rooms.2

The Wolhnan Memorial in Central
Park provides a completely equipped
playground and an artificial ice skating
rink for an extended winter season of
ice skating, and it is used for roller
skating, shufflehoard and dancing in
late spring, summer and early fall.
The City Building in Flushing Mea-
dow Park has been restored to its for-
mer use as an indoor ice and roller
rink, after serving as a meeting place
for the United Nations General As-
sembly.

Through the years considerable ad-
ditions of land and facilities have been
donated by citizens who found plea-
sure in providing for the health, con-
venience and well being of their fel-
lows.3

Many civic organizations, individu-
als, the press and other groups, have
established and maintained, through

sponsorship, annual series of concerts,

age

While most park facilities must be
free, others are a legitimate source of
city revenue. New York faced the
problem of operating costs by making
the pools, beaches, golf courses, tennis
courts and related facilities self-sup-
porting by small rcasonable charges.
Eighteen years of non-political busi-
ness management replaced the old sys-
tem of awarding concessions without
reference to sanitary, business, and
technical standards. Concessionaires
now operate under constant inspec-
tion. Rentals are on a flat fee basis
for small concessions and on a month-

ly percentage of gross business for
larger concessions.

New York’s arterial system, consist-
ing of parkways for passenger traffic
and expressways for mixed traffic, has
provided many advantages along with
uninterrupted travel. Outlying large
recreation areas and beaches are more
accessible. The landscaped parkways
and expressways provide playgrounds,
walks, benches, and comfort stations
to serve adjacent communities. The
taxable values of abutting properties
have been increased; previously unde-
veloped and inaccessible areas have
been opened up, bringing a substantial
return to the city; and zoning amend-
ments have extended the benefits of
light and air created by parkways and
serve to protect the large public in-

vestment in arterial improvement.

cause, if in their early years they learn
that parks and playgrounds are places
for enjoyable, constructive play and
exercise, they will safeguard park
property instead of destroying it
through thoughtless acts of vandalism.

The 1953 allowance for major im-
provements is $11,571,475. The an-
nual budget for maintenance and op-
eration was $6,000,000 in 1934 and
though it has been increased to $20,-
530,500 for 1953, it is totally inade-

quate considering the doubled acre-

age, the five-fold increase in facilities,
the enormously increased public us-
age and the decreased value of the
dollar. Over 145 million visits to New
York City’s parks and playgrounds
were made by people seeking active
recreation during 1952. Additional
millions of visits were made for more
passive recreational pursuits, such as
walking, reading, nature study, rest
and relaxation, and by 'automobilists
who made use of the park drives and
parkways.

Home Town America
at Play

Burt L. Anderson

Surely “Home Town America at Play” is one of the
fascinating chapters in the story of America and the de-
sire of its people to grow. One incident in this story could
well be that of the Glendale, California, Recreation Festi-
val Week. It offers perhaps a new challenge to recreation
workers in all the home towns in America.

Five years ago Glendale staged two special programs at
the close of the summer recreation season, mainly because
of the desire to show the parents what had been going on
in the program. Since the children’s dancing, baton twirl-
ing and swimming lessons were outstanding these two
post-season shows met with immediate and excellent re-
sults.

During this short five-year period, that which was so un-
assumingly begun five years ago has grown to a city wide
festival the like of which was hardly dreamed. This year
it claimed the attention of thousands, intrigued the press
and radio, captured the fancy of numerous clubs and, most
of all, it pleasantly shocked us into the realization that
here was “America at play” even in Glendale, California.
A jump from two to fifty-nine events has indeed been a
drama unfolding before our very eyes.

Today it is truly a community project. In the produc-
tion of this year’s spectacle nineteen organizations assisted
the Division of Parks and Recreation with man power, or-
ganization, leadership and' financing. The Church Coun-
cil, service clubs, lodges, civic and social groups, press and
radio and numerous individuals had a part in this im-
mense program. Even commercial agencies, themselves in-
volved with recreation, assisted.

With an earnest request for good photographs, RECREATION magazine submits the following simple rules for the taking
if effective pictures for publication and promotion purposes, for display, annual reports and for your scrap books.

DO

1. Give advance thought and plan-
ling to the taking of pictures. Choose
rour picture situation carefully.

2. Plan for only one—at most two
—dominant ideas in each picture.

3. Remember that a good picture
ells a story. Show something happen-
ng.

4. Look for human interest.

5. Select a suitable background.

6. Give thought to composition.
Iientally divide your picture into
‘thirds.” Place dominant feature on
31' near one imaginary line. Balance
t with small object (lesser interest)
)1] or near the other imaginary line, in
rdjoining “third.”

7. Take a close-up of not more than
hree or four persons in action when
)hotographing a group activity. Let
.he action of a few tell the story for
he group. If attendance figures are
mportant. include them in picture

HE PHILADELPHIA CONGRESS has been planned for you.

Whoever you are, whatever your part in the recrea-
tion movement, you will find that this year’s big meeting
will offer much of value.

For all, there will be the week of association with co-
workers in the recreation field; and for all there will be
general sessions with inspiring _messages to sustain us dur-
ing the year ahead. Again there will be such congress fea-
tures as the tour of the local community and special field
trips, the commercial and educational exhibits to keep us
up to date, a living c‘raft demonstration (provided this
year by the city of Baltimore), the NRA Consultation
Center with its display of recreation publications, the NRA
Tea with the opportunity it brings early in the week to
meet fellow delegates socially and informally.

Brief study of the list of topics for section meetings,
which will be found on the following page, shows how
many meetings have been scheduled for recreation execu-
tives, park executives,- department supervisors, playground
and indoor center workers, board members and volunteer
lay workers generally, church, hospital, industrial, rural,
public agency and private 'agency, newcomers and old-
timers, administrators, program directors, construction
and maintenance supervisors, professors—and wives.

And not only has the congress program been planned
for all of these groups of people, but it has also been large-
ly planned by representatives of these groups. Recent
issues of RECREATION have carried the names of members
of the congress committees which have been helping with
the planning. Literally hundreds of prospective delegates
have made suggestions for your Philadelphia Congress
program.

Laymen and the Congress

The congress offers each year an exceptionally fine
Opportunity for cooperative thinking and planning by lay
and professional recreation leaders. Basically the progress
of the movement, as carried out under professional leader-
ship, is determined by thousands of public-opinion-form-
ing lay leaders serving on local recreation and park
boards. Other thousands of men and women have volun-
teered to give service to the recreation movement in other
ways. In the National Recreation Association, itself, an
outstanding group of men and women serve on the board
of directors and some four hundred of the nation’s lead-
ing citizens serve as sponsors of the association. Interests
of laymen have definitely been considered in planning this

Exeeutives" Advisory Committee

Under the chairmanship of Jesse Reynolds of Rich-
mond, Virginia, this year a committee of recreation execu-
tives is at work on plans for the annual session on “Ad-
ministrative Problems of Recreation and Park Execu-

tion, is eagerly anticipated by many recreation executives.
Ground rules for it provide that all who wish may attend,
but that only executives may participate in the discussion.

FARM
HOSPI’I‘ALI’I‘Y
PROGMM

THIS IS a story of mashed potatoes, dandelion greens, and
soldiers enjoying the farm, of friendly people who used
what they had to do what they could when the need to serve
was presented to them. It is the story of the good, frugal,
friendly Pennsylvania Dutch folk of Lebanon County,
Pennsylvania, and their farm hospitality program to serve
troops from the Indiantown Gap Military Reservation.

It starts in September 1952, when Richard C. Mitchell,
community services advisor for the Headquarters Second
Army walked into the oflice of David J. DelMarcelle, ex-
ecutive secretary of the Lebanon County Chamber of
Commerce. .

The Indiantown Gap Military Reservation is located in
Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, some fourteen miles from
the city of Lebanon, twenty miles east of Harrisburg, the
state capitol. The “Gap,” as it is termed by some, and
IGMR, which is its designation in army talk, is almost ex-
clusively an infantry basic training center. This is one of
the places where raw, untrained civilian inductees are
transformed in sixteen weeks into soldiers. It is also a
place where all the loneliness, frustration and uncertainty
which accompanies disruption from families, friends and
familiar surroundings has an opportunity to come into
sharp, and sometimes shattering, focus for the first time in
the young lives of the recruits.

Mitchell had conferred with officials at Indiantown Gap,
had talked with the men on the drill field during breaks
in the training routine, and appraised the recreation re-
sources of the communities in the surrounding area—York,
Lancaster, Harrisburg, Hershey, Lebanon, Reading, Potts-
ville. Philadelphia was not too far away, and could be

148

added to the list of weekend leave areas; but a recreation
sense warned that towns and cities were not sufficient leave
areas, despite the variety of resources which they offered.
Like the army wherever it is found today, a substantial
portion of the personnel at IGMR was made up of men
from the small town and the farm. The small cities, the
large cities, the metropolitan areas which were within rea-
sonable distance of the Gap were unknowns to these men,
strange areas which only multiplied the recruit’s sense of

loneliness and confusion when he sought to spend his spare
time there.

These were men from New York State, New England and
the South, the rocky hills of Vermont and the cotton lands
of the Carolinas. Their familiar world was that of plowing
and barn dances and the village square. They were farm
boys, unsettled and uncertain—as are all new inductees,
homesick—as all young persons away from home can be,
and baffled by their new environment. It was the army
awareness of these circumstances and needs which led the

community services advisor to visit the Lebanon County
Chamber of Commerce.

Mr. DelMarcelle, who had spent a part of his military
service at IGMR, subscribed to the idea that farm visits
would be valuable to trainees who had farm backgrounds,
and was convinced that here was an opportunity for the
people of Lebanon County to give a service to the army.
The trim, prosperous Pennsylvania Dutch farms of the area
were perfect settings for such a project, in DelMarcelle's
opinion, and he suggested that the plan be presented to the
Agriculture Committee of the Chamber.

On October 22, Mitchell, accompanied by John W. Faust.
National Recreation Association district representativ
and two officers from the Gap, met with the Agricultur
Committee. The plan was presented as one which shoul
seek to personalize the services to the men rather th
serve large groups in a mass program which would becon
necessarily impersonal. Since it was correctly anticipat
that more men would want to participate in the program
than could possibly be accommodated, the decision w
made that only inductees who had practiced farming prio
to their entry into the army and who intended to make
farming their career when their military service was com
pleted should be served by this program. Screening of in
ductees and their orientation was a necessary step and the

ICMR personnel accepted this responsibility.

The plan was unanimously ad0pted by the committee,
and a sub-committee was named at once to put it into
effect. Mrs. Andrew K. Mish of Myerstown, Pennsylvania,
was named as chairman of this group, and with her fellow
committee members immediately moved to make the plan
a reality.

From a recreation point of view perhaps the most inter‘
csting process in the development of this program came nol
with the advent of the specific program itself but in the
“warming up” process which intervened. An opportunity
to become acquainted with the problems and practices of
the Gap would be useful to the community leaders whc

were to have prominent roles in develOping the liOSpitality

rogram. Also, citizens felt that an opportunity to join
with a group of the inductees in a community social setting
rould be a genuine “ice-breaker.”

The first half of this process was undertaken by IGMR
rhen twenty-six representatives of the county chamber of
ommerce were transPorted to the camp, to view the basic
raining program in action, learn about the Troop Infor-
lation and Education program offered on the post (with
articular attention directed to those portions of the edu-
ation program which dealt with agricultural topics), and
0 sample the variety of services which the army provides
.n-post to serve the leisure time needs of its personnel.

.‘as completed when the North Jackson Grange feted forty-
we servicemen at a traditional Pennsylvania Dutch
Thanksgiving Day dinner. The square (lance which fol-
owcd completed the socializing process, and was high-
ighted when a serviceman from Auburn, Maine, proved to
to both a Grange member and a top-notch square dance
aller.

The product of this “warming-up” process was a better
mderstanding by both parties concerning what each group
vas like, what could be done, and how to go about it. Any
cnse of strangeness or stiff formality was being dispelled
1y these neighborly events. Only when this point of group

undcrstanding had been reached was it time to think of
putting the program on a person-to-person basis in the
farm homes.

Commencing with the weekend following the Thanksgiv-
ing Day dinner, and continuing every weekend since,
groups of men from ICMR havc been guests in Lebanon
County homes. The good wives of the countryside are bak-
ing extra pics and cakes, the servicemen are milking cows
and driving tractors, the children are doing their hero-
worshipping at first hand, and the farmers and the induc-
tees are comparing the relative merits of Allis-Chalmers
versus John Deere farm implements. The men go to the

[JUNE 1953

Grange dance on Saturday night with the host family (ser-
vicemen admitted free), and usually attend church with
the family on Sunday morning. If they prefer to go to a
church different from that which the host family attends,

the host family takes them there and picks them up after
the service.

“I went out early this morning to gather a dish of dande-
lion greens,” said one farmwife who was preparing to wel-
come a soldier lad into her home. “I just know he won’t
have had anything like that at the camp.” Another farm-
wife found that her guest wanted to help in the kitchen, so
she let him mash potatoes. Several farmers had to bc con-
vinced they would not be guilty of exploitation of the
soldiers if they let them do some of the chores. In fact, the
principal problems encountered by Mrs. Mish and her com-
mittee was that of convincing the families they shouldn’t
treat the men too much like “‘company.”

“My boy is going into the service soon,” said one farmer,
“and I wanted to see what the men in the army arc like.
The ones who came to visit us made me feel hetter about
the whole thing, and gave my youngster a chance to learn
something about the army in preparation for his own in-
duction.”

The prosperous farms of Lebanon County are well and
widely known, and the constant striving toward informality
in the farm visits is combining to make those visits richly
productive in a recreational-educational sense. The men
are seeing, at first hand, farm methods which have proved
successful; they are comparing notes with the farmers,
learning about dairy herds and marketing practices; and
all the time they are enjoying themselves. They are being
drawn into the year-round educational activities of the
chamber of commerce—in programs ranging from .poultry-
cutting demonstrations to formal presentations of agricul-
tural studies. Everywhere the soldiers go they are welcomed,
they are included as members of the group, and in ithis
companionship and acceptance they find both meaning and
pleasure.

So rapidly did community interest in the farm hospitality
program spread that, when announcement was made at the
Gap that trainees could not be given passes to go home
over the Christmas holidays because of the urgency of the
training program, DelMarcelle, Mrs. Mish, and hundreds of
people of the area rallied to see what they could provide
which would in part substitute for the Christmas holiday
at home. The radio and TV stations responded promptly,
newspapers were equally generous in their coverage, and
invitations to Christmas dinner poured into the chamber
of commerce headquarters. Invitations were received from
all the surrounding counties, and from as far away as
Philadelphia; and two telephone lines were jammed with
a flow of invitations during this period.

Four hundred men from the Gap——every man who
wanted an opportunity to Spend Chrislmas off the post—
were provided for through this program. So tremendous
was the throng that gathered in Lebanon to meet the cara-

van of loaded buses from IGMR that the Reading Railroad
loaned its bus station for use as the meeting point.

149

There are only a few Negro families in the Lebanon
County area, but they were determined to play their full
part in this Christmas program. As a consequence, some
of these families had six to eight soldier guests at their
table when dinner was served.

In addition to the home hospitality at Christmas time,
the Lebanon Kiwanis Club, Jewish Welfare Board, YMCA
and USO combined to provide an afternoon recreation pro-
gram in the YMCA and an evening dance in the Weimer
Hotel. Although many servicemen attended the dance,
DelMarcelle received a number of telephone calls from
well-fed soldier-guests who wanted to know if attendance
at the dance was compulsory. Assured that the only com-
pulsory action was that they enjoy themselves, many elected
to bask in the comfort of the homes they were visiting,
content to let a prodigious dinner be gracefully digested.

Behind this well conceived.and carefully directed plan,
it is this precise attention to detail on the part of the com-
munity group which is basic to its successful operation.
The men arrive from the Gap early Saturday afternoon in
transportation provided by the army. They are met by
DelMarcelle, Mrs. Mish, and the host families for that
week. The sheer friendliness of the hosts and the objective
sense of the committee operate at this moment to dispel
any lingering uncertainty on the part of the soldiers. Del-
Marcelle usually starts things with an informal briefing in
which he tells about the program and how it will operate
for this particular group. There are no complicated rules
or stilted procedures. He does point out, however, that
there are certain local customs, such as church attendance,
to which the men are asked to adapt themselves.

An equally careful job has been done to prepare the
farm families for their role. Even such apparently minor
details as providing the visitor with a bite to eat when he
arrives at the farm, if he’s hungry, are now included in
the program. This became a practice when it was dis-
covered that many of the men, who are in training until
noon on Saturday, were missing chow in their hurry to

shower, change to clean clothes and catch the transporta

-tion to town. Any recreation worker knows the value of

food as a socializer and so will appreciate how this bit of
thoughtfulness serves to accelerate the getting-acquainted
process.

So cooperative is the spirit of the'community that, if on:
family wants to be hosts to men from the Gap but canno
provide them with adequate sleeping accommodations, an
other family will take responsibility for this portion of thl
service, taking them into their home for the night and re
turning them to the host home for breakfast on Sunday
morning.

Another facet of the skillful administration of this pro
gram is the effort to “match” the agricultural experienc:
and interest of the men with the farm family they are tt
visit. When the Gap advises the county committee as t(
how many men will be visiting on the next weekend, thc
information includes the states from which the men com:
and the type of farming with which they are most familiar
The soldier from Wisconsin who is interested in dairj
farming, or the serviceman who is interested in poultrj
raising, or the New Jersey lad whose background is asso
ciated with general farming, find themselves guests 01
farms which fit in these interest categories.

As is to be expected, once the serviceman is brought intt
contact with one of the families through this program, his
future visits to the community can be self-directed. Th:
men are revisiting their host families independently, an:
the farm folk are receiving letters from the parents, wives
and friends of the men so entertained, expressing agaii
appreciation for this hOSpitality.

This, then, is the story of Lebanon County and its faru
hospitality program—of its wonderful pe0ple, of splendid
organization and leadership. It’s a simple story of using
what is at hand to serve those who will be benefitted by th(
opportunity to share in it. It’s the kind of program whic
can be tailored to local situations everywhere to becom
new and exciting stories of service to our armed forces.

course, at night all hatches were closed
to provide a flat surface for the six
sleeping bags under the canvas tent,
which was securely lashed to rings
along each side.

Searching in our sail loft, we found
some old rigging and selected a mast,
boom, and a triangular sail which was
cut down to fit and appropriately dec-
orated. An old oar, mounted in a re-
movable socket at the stern, provided
us with a rudder which was all that
was needed to permit our craft to
navigate the far reaches of our four-
teen-mile lake. We always took along
six canoe paddles should it be neces-
sary to head into the wind, or to in-
crease the cruising speed. The boom
served a double purpose, for at night
after the sail was furled it was raised
to proper level to provide a ridge pole
for the tent. An extra, pole, cut the
correct length, was carried on board
to support the aft end.

A hungry crew must eat, and a
couple of days “at sea” requires hot
food. Yes, just aft of the mast we
constructed a 24 by 24 inch square, 4
inches deep, and lined with asbestos.
This was filled level with sand and
served as a fireplace. Long books
from the boom supported kettles over
the fire at desired heights. Folding
reflector ovens of our own design pro-
vided bread and pies. Fire hazard was
negligible with water all around us,
and dish washing was a cinch.

Should the canoes be needed in
camp, it is a simple matter to lift the
lightweight deck after untying the
four stay-ropes attached to the mast.

The craft is re-assemhled by reversing
the process and, with four ahle men,
this takes but a short time.

The Po-Tiki was enjoyed by camp-
ers of all ages from seven to seven-
teen, as well as by the staff. It proved
to be the safest craft of our whole lleet,
as it just can’t capsize. There was
always a new crew selected and wait-
ing to get out as soon as one crew re-
turned, reported.
Wherever she traveled she never failed
to puzzle fishermen and other passing
boats.

The most interesting cruise resulted
from installing on board a two-way

cleaned up and

ship-to-shore short-wave radio giving
us direct communication between our
camp radio room and the Po-Tiki

introduced to the international crew

The “Hora,” near the foot of Mt. Gilhoa in Israel.

A FOLK DANCER was heard to remark recently that he
learned the “Hora” from a YMCA leader, “Im Hoop-
alnu” from a Chinese instructor, and the “Hora Aggadati”
from a Swedish-American boy whose activities in the field
were, until recently, confined to western-style square dance
calling. And Mary Ann Herman, of Folk Dance House,
had the interesting experience of teaching some of the
Israel dances to a group of nuns in Pittsburgh. The nuns,
in turn, were planning to teach them to students at the
parochial school there. It’s a long way from the days when
dancing was considered wicked and immoral by most
church folk. Today, there are many champions of the
dance in various branches of religion. "

In fact, some of the most delightful dances to join the
dances-of—nlany-lands movement which has been sweeping
the country for more than a decade have been coming to us
from the young state of Israel. Ranking in popularity with
the favorite dances of Sweden, Russia, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland and the Balkans, wherever these international
dances are enjoyed, are the sprightly “Mayim,” the vig-
orous “Hora Aggadati,” the delicate “El Ginot Egoz,” the
defiant “Im Hoopalnu,” the captivating “Harmonica,” the
oriental “Mechol Ovadya” and the “Hora,” Israel’s na-
tional dance. And to the vocabulary of such folk dance
terms as the “buzz step,” the “polka step” and the “schot-
tische step” have recently been added the “debka step” and
the “Yemenite step.”

The earlier Palestinian dances were mostly importations

from European countries. While some of them retained

their original flavor, others began to show the oriental in
fluence of the Arabs and Yemenites. In addition, the co}
lective way of living and the lack of movies and othei
kinds of entertainment in the rural sections of Israel, a:
well as the natural need for self-expression, lead to [l]!
creation of many new dances. Some of these dances devel
oped spontaneously out of a group, while others were cre
ated by, or with, the aid of teachers and choreographers
The newer dances, too, show a strong oriental flavor. Chor
eographers have also been studying the Bible and othe.
sources for clues as to how the ancient dances of th:
Hebrews were performed. The folk dance festivals, held a
Dalia in the hills of Ephraim every second year, which at
tract thousands of people from all over the country, gav:
impetus to the folk dance movement in Israel. These fes
tivals provide an opportunity for the exchange of danc:
material among the various groups and serve as a stimu
lus for new creations in the folk manner. Very often thes:
dances undergo a number of changes before they an
brought to the United States.

One of the dances which has gone through a curiow
transformation since it came from its original home is th:
Hora. To Jewish people all over the world there is a kint
of magic in the word “Hora” and even non-Jews canno
resist the contagious joy of this simple dance. It came t1
Palestine from Rumania as a vigorous, peasant dance bad
in the early twenties. It was introduced by some of th:
early chalutzim (pioneers who came to rebuild the lam
destined to become their people’s home). These chalutzin
would stop in the middle of their labors to dance the Hora
hands on each others shoulders, singing their own accom
paniment. They danced in the hibbutzim (cooperative set
tlements) at night after work, and in the streets or along
the road. They would start out slowly, moving to the lef
(or to the right) with a step, cross, step-hop, step-hop, bu
gradually the dancing increased in tempo until it ended ii
an almost frenzied mood of rapturous joy. It was this ec
static dancing that moved the well known writer an:
scholar, Dr. Wolfgang von Weisl, to say, “Not to have see:
the Hora danced in Palestine is hardly to know what danc
ing means.” In it they danced their hOpe and determina
tion for a new homeland, they danced for freedom foreve
from persecution, they danced with joy as they saw th
buildings springing up around them and the fruits of thei

labors bursting forth from the desert and the former
swaniplands. They opened the circle wider to let in new
immigrants. Many of the newcomers were gifted com-
posers and created new music for the Hora (as well as
other dances) and many were trained dancers and chor-
eographers. The dancing became lighter under the influ-
ence of the oriental landscape—the surrounding hills and
vallcys, the fragrant orange groves, the silent waters of the
Dead Sea, and the soft melody of the shepherd’s flute. And
finally, their joy knew no bounds when the little parcel of
land about the size of New Jersey became the State of
Israel. “Am Yisrael Hai” they sang again and again as
they danced, “Israel Lives Forever.”

Today the Hora is danced at almost any kind of Jewish
festival or celebration, as well as folk dance gatherings.
In America, it is not uncommon to see young boys and
girls gather in small groups in an auditorium or some
other place, after an important event of some kind, and
dance the Hora with the same ecstasy and rapture as the
early chalutzim. They dance on the stage, in the aisles,
outsiclc the building, any place where there’s a little empty
space.

Almost as well known as the Hora is the “Cherkessia.”
This is a line dance which was brought to Palestine by
the Mohammedans_of Circassia in Southeastern Russia
who had fled persecution by the Czar. It was originally a
men’s dance, but women joined the line in Palestine. A
leader at the beginning of the line usually gives the cue
for the next step, sometimes following a set pattern, but
often improvising. A chorus step is repeated after each
figure. There is also a “Double Cherkessia,” which is usu-
ally done in couples, but sometimes in sets of three or
four. This is a little trickier to do because of its off-beat
rhythm, but the music is so gay and the dance has such a
wonderful lilt to it that it’s worth trying.

A dramatic moment in the history of Israel—the British
blockade—was responsible for the emergence of “Im
Hoopalnu” (Though Defeated). Although the music,
which has a determined ring to it, may be partly respon-
aihle for its popularity, the dance itself, with its strong
rhythm and promise of victory, is irresistible. However, it

Is not recommended for beginners. “Im Hoopalnu” is a -

.irirclc dance and like others of this type does not require
Jartners.

[van 1953
I

Among the dances which represent a combination of
European and oriental movements, and which are well
known in this country, are the “Circle from Sarid,” “Liv-
shu Na Os” (Put on Strength), and the “Hora Aggadati,”
named after its creator, Baruch Aggadati, a Russian bal-

let dancer. All of these contain the debka step of the Ar-
abic shepherd dance.

Dancing played an important part in thc life of the an-
cient Hebrews. Whenever an important event took place
or an occasion arose for celebration, the peOple expressed
their joy and happiness in dance. The numerous refer-
ences to dancing in the Bible indicate that it was accepted
as part of the beauty and loveliness of life. It is not sur-

prising, therefore, that present day dances should draw
their inspiration from the Bible.

The joy of the early settlers in bringing water out of
the desert is expressed in the lovely dance, “Mayim, Ma-
yim!” (Water, Water). As the circle moves to the left
in a wave-like movement, the dancers sing, in Hebrew, tl1c
words of Isaiah: “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
out of the wells of salvation.” And with light, springy
steps, they move in towards the well and express their joy
for the water that will make the wilderness blossom with
a thousand flowers, that will bring food to thousands of
hungry mouths.

A number of new dances based on Biblical themes, with
music by modern Israeli composers, have recently been
introduced to America and are fast becoming popular.
Among them are “Kol Dodi” (a line dance), “El Ginal:
Egoz,” “Iti Milvanon” and “Dodi Li,” all of which were
inspired by the Song of Songs. The latter three are couple
dances. Both the music and the dances show the Yemenitc
influence. It is the Yemenites of Southern Arabia, with
their exquisite grace and primitive sense of rhythm, the
main. preservers of the Jewish cultural tradition, who hold
the key to what may develop into the real dance of Israel.
Gertrude Kaufmann, whose pioneering work in connection
with folk dancing in Israel can be compared to the efforts
of Elizabeth Burchenal in this country, and who conceived
the idea of the Dalia festivals, was surprised enough at the
popularity of “El Ginot” to remark: “We would not have
believed, some years ago, that our vigorous, rough pionccr
youth who somewhat resembled the Wild Westerners in
America, would be willing and able to learn and take over
the elaborate, refined, stylist hand-gestures of the Yemc-
nites.” The Yemenite influence can also be found in
“Mechol Ovadya,” a line dance whichxs’tarts out with a
slow, almost monotonous chorus step to the slightly synco-
pated rhythm of an Arabic drum heat. This step is inter-
rupted several times by a series of quick movements con-
sisting of variations on the debka step. The dance can be
described as being characteristic of the endless desert and
the sudden appearance of desert storms. “Mechol” is He-
brew for “dance of” and “Ovadya” was the name of thc
drummer who inspired its creation.

The Israel Dance Festival held at Hunter College in New
York City last year, and again this year, with the partici-
pation of various Jewish youth groups, has attracted con-

153

siderable interest. While the festival is held in the form
of a contest, thereby giving the activity the wrong kind of
stimulus, it does give the participants an Opportunity to
present a great deal of material for the information of folk
dance enthusiasts, as well as an opportunity to do some-
thing creative in the folk style. Although it is impossible
to keep up with all of the dances presented, these new crea-
tions should not be discouraged, since they keep the move-
ment alive and growing. To some of the experienced
dancers who have been enjoying the better known ones for
some time there is a constant challenge, with little danger
of getting bored. And in the end it is their popularity and
the people’s acceptance and modification of them that
makes them folk dances. It should be remembered, too,
that many of the dances known as folk dances today were
created by dancing masters hundreds of years ago, while
others were ballroom dances enjoyed by the elite. It
should also be pointed out that the art dance and the folk
dance are not as far apart in Israel as in some other coun-
tries (where the art form follows a more highly deve10ped
classical style) since both forms are closely related to the
everyday life of the peOple.

Were it not for the tremendous interest in folk dancing
in the United States today, we might never have been in-
troduced to some of these charming Israel dances. The
overwhelming response to the movement in this country
proved that there was a need for such an activity; pe0ple
were, unconsciously, rebelling against the cheap kind of
entertainment being fed them via the movies, radio and

part, by the people living in the rural sections of the coun-
try where the American folk dances (in the form oi

for nearly two hundred years. And thanks to the excellenl

it has been possible to produce some very fine records

has not remained static in this country either. We have
our folk dance festivals and camps, and square dance jam

Mrs. Jack Niellus

7F YOU were a visitor at our Wel-
Com-Inn youth canteen, in Fre-
mont, Nebraska, you would be sur-
prised at the close of the evening to
see how the clean-up committee col-
[ects mops and brooms and goes to
work sweeping, dusting, moving fur-
niture, polishing, picking up pop bot-
tles and getting the place in order for
another evening of fun.

Cleaning the canteen used to be our
biggest problem until we hit upon the
idea of going down the membership
list and posting four names on the
bulletin board every meeting night for
Clean-up committee duties. Under this
procedure, I call the young people by
telephone to be 511113 they know when
it’s their turn to clean. If they can’t
report that night, they are to have
Isomeone take their place. If they or
their substitutes fail to appear at can-
teen closing time, the latter are for-
hidden to come to the canteen for a
month.

At first, the young people didn’t
like this and felt they were being
forced to work. After two or three
weeks they realized that actually they
were only keeping their own canteen
Clean, and they were gaining first-hand
knowledge of how their evening’s fun
created a lot of dust that- someone
else had to remove. In this way, ev-
eryone was doing his share and not
placing the cleaning burden upon the
same people all of the time.

in addition, every time a young
person cleans, scrubs or waxes the
floor, or decorates the canteen, he or
she receives one merit point. Eighteen
points entitle the youngster to write

or print his name in white paint on
a large red autograph wall.

The young people are very proud of
this wall, and each tries to outdo the
others by making the name look dif-
ferent. After a canteen member has
his name on the wall, he can earn five
stars and thus be pictured in a special
photograph frame. Each star repre-
sents eighteen more points. This sys-
tem has worked-beautifully.

We have oflicers for our canteen,
elected once a year by the members.
They meet with the director once a
month to plan parties and discuss
ways to improve the canteen. Rules
and penalties are made by them. We
have a sergeant-at-arms, and he has
three helpers. If any young people de-
stroy property or become rowdy, the
sergeants see that they cease such ac-
tion or leave the canteen.

Our local newspaper has helped
canteen publicity with stories and pic-
tures regarding our activities. We
also have a splendid city recreation
board with which to work.

Each time the canteen is open, the-

parents of members act as chaperones.
One couple carries responsibility for
the evening. The father’s job is to
stand by the door and check to see
that each person entering has a mem-
bership card, obtainable for one dol-
lar a year. If the youngster has no
card, he may pay fifteen cents for a

single admission. The man sponsor

also checks the boys’ restroom occa-
sionally. Smoking is allowed only in
the restroom. The mother works be-
hind a counter, checking out ping-
pong equipment and selling candy and
ice cream bars.

A youngster must be in his or her
teens before becoming eligible to join
the canteen. Some young people visit
it every time it is open, and others
come only once in a while. It is open
on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

Our attendance averages about sev-
enty-five per evening, but after a high
school athletic event, we have from
three hundred to four hundred present.
This number includes guests from vis-
iting schools.

Once a month we hold Junior High
Night, allowing seventh and eighth
graders of the city to dance, visit and
play ping-pong and shufiieboard.
There are usually about 200 in at-
tendance. They, too, clean up when
the evening is over. The junior high
principal asks for volunteers at school
for the clean-up work, and about ten
offer their services; but during the
evening perhaps eight or ten more will
volunteer. We always find something
for them to do, and they leave with a
feeling that they have helped to make
the canteen as neat and orderly as
they found it.

I still say teen-agers will work if
approached in the right manner—and

if they think it’s fun.

THE PINWHEEL. Most communities have high school,

college or other groups that do preeision swimming drills.

A WATER SHOW is like any other form of dramatics, ex-

cept that it’s staged in and on the water instead of “on
the boards” by thespians. In drama, one has marionettes,
impromptu dramatization of stories, vaudeville skits, one
act plays, long plays, processions, festivals and pageants,
and so on. Similar activities, with water predominant in
the scene are: aquatic demonstrations, marine parades,
aqua-follies, aquacades, aquatic carnivals, water plays and
water pageants. A swimming pool or protected body of
natural water with seating facilities provides the location.
The excellence of the production is limited only by the
initiative and work of the director. The assembled water
show, characterized by variety, is used more often than
any other, so a standard program is presented here.

ASSEMBLED SHOW

Let’s consider a typical, simple, easily assembled show
for a municipal pool. The talent is already in existence
in most communities. A good M.C. keeps the show roll-
ing with the aid of some swim officials and a few play-
ground directors. The aquatic director in charge will

probably wind up with something like this, variation be-
ing subject to the locality:

 

NATHAN MALLISON, the superintendent of recreation in
Jacksonville, Florida, directs an exciting water program.

156

Nathan L. Mallison

1. “Star Spangled Banner”-——Recorded music over the
RA. system, while a lone spot or sealed beam light illumi-
nates the flag on a bulkhead if staged at night.

2. Snappy demonstration of strokes by groups taking
instruction in Red Cross, “Y,” or pool learn-to-swim
classes. Tadpoles—across pool, dog-paddle. Minnows—
across pool, opposite direction, using elementary crawl.
Sharks—length of pool, breast stroke. Porpoises—length
of pool, opposite direction, using back stroke.

3. Novelty Canoe Race—Three canoes from Scouts,
nearby camp or canoe club. The hand-paddling race, four

.to a canoe, would be good for this event. Have a rope

finish ten feet from the end of pool and attendants to stop
canoes from hitting sides of pool.

4. Simple Water Ballet or Figure Swimming—Most
communities have a high school, college, or other girls
group that does a precision swimming drill in the same
type suits and caps. Text books on the subject of such
drills will assist the neophyte director who must train his
own “aquamaids.”

5. Novelty Swim Race—Swimming on the back with a
lighted candle or carrying an open umbrella.

6. Fancy Diving Exhibition—Four to eight capable
divers from high school, college or a nearby naval station
should show all categories of dives, not exceeding a total

of twenty-four. Try to avoid repeats. Announce only the
name of the diver and his dive.

7. Canoe Tilting—Small decks, two feet long, are fas-
tened to gunwales of canoes over the front seat. The tilter

plumbers friend. The paddler sits on the bottom of the
canoe, in front of the, rear seat. The M.C. serves as ref-
eree. The object is for a tilter to push his opponent into
the water. Two out of three falls constitute a match.

8. Novelty Swim Race—The duck race, in which each
contestant swims with a pie tin in each hand, is good.

9. Water Ballet—By an older or more experienced
group than the one in number 4. Girls may carry water-
proof flashlights on each wrist or wear fluorescent caps, in
which case lighting effects are necessary. In daytime, pad-
dle boards, with devices on them, add dramatic effect.

10. Comedy Diving and Swimming—Use existant “aq-
uamaniacs,” if available; otherwise run as a contest to de-
termine the zaniest diver. Costumes add to the laughs.

RECREATION

The danger is that water comedians, unless their act is
carefully rehearsed, may stay out too long. A burlesque
of the water ballet is also effective. The comedy diving
makes a good finale. End with a cheerful “Goodnight”
and a snappy “Anchors Aweigh” or “Semper Fidelis” on

the P.A. recorder. The M.C. should dress in yachting cos-

tunie, and his aides in white sport shirt, ducks, and shoes.”

A line-up crew insures the readiness of each act. Pool
decorations such as colored lights and pennants add to the

Showmanship.
WATER CA RNI VAL

By “gilding the lily,” the assembled show may become a.

carnival. Cut the demonstration swims and novelty swim
races. Add a local pageant, choosing a queen and princes-
ses. Last year’s queen presides until the new one is chosen.
Get politicians, radio announcers and beauty parlor op-
erators to be judges.

Neptune, Aphrodite (who rose from the sea), Amphi-
trite (wife of Posidon), Davey Jones and Jack Tar (typi-
cal sailor) are legendary characters associated with the
sea who may be set up as a court to rule over the water
carnival. They should be enthroned opposite the “Queen
of the Carnival,” if one is chosen.

\VATER SKIING

If a water show is conducted on a lake or lagoon with
no surf, water skiing and aquaplaning may be included.
Tourists visiting Cypress Gardens at Lake Eloise, Florida,
are treated to a fine show by the Dick Pope Troupe. With
the exception of a few stunts, like the “helicopter spin” and
double jumps, the average group of youngsters can learn
to water ski in formation, on one foot, over jumps, criss-
cross, two high, on chairs and on miniature skis about
half as big as a barrel stave.

MARINE PARADE

In a large pool or lake, decorated canoes may stage a
parade. Such a procession has many variations, ranging
from the simplicity of couples dressed in national costumes
as paddlers in a canoe with a few crepe paper festoons for
decorations, to elaborate but light superstructures on the
craft. The most elaborate prize winner I ever saw was a
big duck built over a canoe with three ducklings, sup-
ported by inner tubes, towed behind. Other “floats” that
can be built on canoes are: Venetian gondolas, replicas of
the Clermont (side wheel pr0pulsion, hand operated),
Mississippi stern wheelers, Viking barques, old woman and
the shoe, and the old mill, to mention a few. A catamaran,
made of two eighteen-foot canoes and paddled by eight
paddlers makes an effective barge for a queen.

There are many types of marine parades. In California.
there is an annual gathering of a small sailboat class which
is called “the flight of the snowbirds.” Miami, Florida, has
a marine parade of charter fishing boats, run parallel to
one of its causeways. Tampa, Florida, stages a mock in-
vasion by Jose Gasparilla, a pirate of other days. Hun-
dreds of cruisers escort the pirate ship which is a square
rigger. Palm Beach, Florida, used to stage a Venetian
Nights Parade. All cruisers were decked with signal flags

JUNE 1953

and colored lights. Some carried choral groups. Barges,
towed by tugs, carried tableaus like the wedding of Nep-
‘tune and Amphitrite, Jason and the Argonauts, Ulysses the
Wanderer, and many others, lighted with fusees.

AQUACADES

Aquacades, such as those staged by Billy Rose at numer-
ous expositions and in the motion picture, “A Million
Dollar Mermaid,” are really colossal and expensive ex-
travaganzas which can be used as models for reproduc-
tion, on a much smaller scale, in a municipal or club pool.
The water ballet is a major feature of such a production.

 

WATER SKIING. The average group of good swimmers can
learn to ski in formation. Aquamaids at Cypress Gardens.

PLAYS

“How Swimming Grew Up,” written by the late, be-
loved Commodore Longfellow of the National Red Cross
staff, is a splendid example of an educational pageant
which Elderdice and Mallison rewrote as an actual water
drama with spoken parts.

Johnny Kemp’s “Waruna of Bali,” used by the Ameri-
can University Group is also fairly well known.

Dorothy Claussen is currently working .on an idea for a
water pageant in which the signs of the zodiac will be fea-
tured. This will include a narrated horoscope with back-
ground music, while swimmers do synchronized numbers
and water pantomimes.

One of the oldest plays associated with maritime history
is the traditional ceremony for those crossing the equator
for the first time. Since many people will never get a
chance to be the unwilling victims in this bit of aquatic
horseplay, it could be used as an initiation for those
“crossing the line” for the first time in the pool. “Cross-
ing the line” in this case would be the line between the
wading and swimming depths. King ‘Neptune, Davey

157

Jones and other legendary characters can be worked into

this drama.
STAGING HINTS

Water pageants and plays are staged much like an ice
show. Three sides of the pool are open to the audience.
A drop curtain, hanging into the water, parallel to the
deep end and about five feet from the edge, permits entries
from behind stage and unseen exits. _ '

0 Underwater lighting permits many unique effects. Spot-
lights are not always successful because a,shallow angle
of projection refracts light in the spectators’ eyes rather
than revealing the activities of the aquatic ballerinas.

0 Grease paint make-up works as well for water shows as
on the stage. Powder is not used in the make-up. Burnt
cork, soluble in water, is unsatisfactory.

0 Oil cloth, on which designs are painted can be used for
costumes that do not cling when a performer comes out of
the water.

0 _Actual ballet numbers may be staged on a concourse of
the pool or on a platform or runway built above the water.
The participants may paddle to the platform in a canoe or

.be taken to it during a blackout.

CAMPUS
RECREATION TRAINING

FOR THE past four summers the University of Colorado

at Boulder-has sponsored, during the second session, a
Recreation Workshop which offers a fine opportunity to
combine study and recreation through an enjoyable ex-
perience. It is designed to train recreation leaders—those
preparing to go into this professional field and those de-
siring refresher courses of instruction—and attracts at-
tendance from many states.

Features of the workshop are the field work activities
providing experience opportunities for the students and
many happy hours of recreation for all members of the
student body who wish to participate. The weekends are
crammed with opportunities for camping, hiking, moun-
tain climbing, fishing, touring and visitations to resort and
historic places. The courses in camping concentrate on
these weekend trips, include sunset sings, fun fests.

Heading the workshop is Harold D. Meyer, director of
the University of North Carolina’s Recreation Leadership
Training. Mildred Scanlon, field specialist in social rec-

The Benefits of
Beach Development

ROBLEMS RELATING to the develop-
P nlent and preservation of beaches
wch discussed at the 1952 meeting of
thc American Shore and Beach Preser-
vation Association and the proceed-
ings’ of the meeting contain valuable
information for all who are concerned
with beach protection and operation.

The desirability of arriving at the
cstimated value of beach front im-
provements has long been reCOgnized,
but very little basis for developing
such estimates has been available. For
this reason a paper presented .by Mr.
John J. Curry of the Connecticut State
Water describing
beach program of this state, has special

Commission, the
significance. It points out that forty
million people, or one out of every
four in the United States, live within
three hundred miles of the Connecticut
shore, and that the state parks alone
have almost 1,500,000 visitors a year.
One state park alone entertains about
thrce times as many visitors a year as
Yellowstone National Park. The direct
seasonal income of shore resorts is es-
timated at $20,000,000, and attendance
records indicate that on days of heavy
attendance only seven square feet of
sandy beach per visitor are available at
some of the public beaches.

Two individual beachI projects are
selected to illustrate the value of shore-
front improvement. One is a state park
wherc the shore-front is one and onc-
half miles long and where the attend-
ance in 1951 was nearly 250,000. Ten
thousand visitors were entertained in
one day, a relatively small attendance
compared with other state parks and
public beaches. In spite of the fact

" Published in Share and Beach, October,
1952.

that the only recreational asset of the
park is its shore-front location, there
is no sandy beach between high and
low water and little sand above high
water. The improvement plan involves
production of a beach varying from
one hundred to one hundred fifty feet
in width, construction of walls to sta-
bilize a creek and a rip-rap groin for
retention of the beach. The estimated
cost of the entire project would be
$342,000. Annual cost, including re-
plenishing of the sand, would be
$19,460. According to Mr. Curry, “The
only benefits in this case were the in-
creased recreational value. The project
will provide suitable beach for 200,000
of the present yearly visitors who are
not adequately accommodated, and an
expected new attendance of 300,000.
“The average expenditure by indi-
viduals to reach this beach is one dol-
lar. It is assumed that half of such ex-
penditure is for use of the beach since
the only other facility available is at-
mosphere. At fifty cents per visitor
the annual recreational benefit of the
beach is $250,000. The annual benefit
is 12.8 times the annual cost. There
are, of course, other benefits such as
prevention of progressive loss of what
little beach is now available, saving of
rehabilitation costs which might result
from a heaVy storm, and prevention of
injury to bathers. But the benefit ratio
is already so high that there is little
practical point in adding to it.”
The'other example cited is that of a
small town beach, 1,200 feet in length,
only a part of which is usable. It is
overcrowded by 36,000 annual visitors.
At the peak use of 1,300 there are only
fifteen square feet of beach per person
The plan for improving the beach by

widening it would cost $31,000, with
annual charges totaling $2,385. Pres-
ent maintenance cost is $730 a year.

Mr. Curry points out that “the im-
provement would increase the patron-

age by at least fifty per cent. The value
of the facility per visitor was estab-
lished to be at least twenty cents, giv-
ing a total benefit of $4,330 or 1.8
times the annual cost. In addition, but
not computed, were the benefits from
improved facilities for the present
users and protection of the adjacent
highway.” It has been recommended
that one-third of the cost of the project
be met by the federal government, the
remainder by the town. “Such a proj-
ect represents a sizeable public benefit
for a reasonably sized local expendi-
ture. In simple town meeting econom-
ics, the town would spend $20,000, or
less if some state interest and appro-
priation could be obtained, and would
thereby save $730 a year on mainte-
nance. At present bonding rates this,
by itself, might be a practical expendi-
ture, but in addition a valuable beach
for 54,000 swimmers a year, road safe-
ty, concession returns, and so on, would
accrue.”

The importance of preventing pollu-
tion of waters adjoining beaches was
stressed by Mr. Seth C. Hess of the
Interstate Sanitation Commission of
New York, New Jersey and Connecti-
He stated, “Eliminate the useless,
yes. Reduce inefficient operation, yes.
Prohibit unnecessary public expendi-
ture, yes, but not the expenditures
which are in the best interest of the
public. The greatest economy of all is
to spend to gain. It behooves us little
to avoid expenditures if in so doing we
create a menace to public health or de-
prive pe0ple of recreation in times of
great stress. Clean beaches are a great
asset to a people harried by the pres-
sures of the world today. Therefore I

cut.

plead for a vocal public, a people who
are willing to tell their municipal ad-
ministrators that they need, that they
want, pollution control works, and that
they are willing to pay the nominal
costs for the great benefits that may be
derived from these expenditures to
provide water protection for beach
preservation.”

means that three seasons intervene be- '

fore the next break in the monotony
of daily life. This is a long time in
anyone’s calendar.

One good way to shorten the in-be-
tween-times is to take lots of souvenir
photographs during the halcyon days
of fun and frolic. How better to re-
member places seen, people met and
things done than with sharp black-
and-white photographs or color trans-
parencies or movies? Snapshots make
the best souvenirs of any trip or va-
cation and enable one to relive the
pleasures of years past. And it is cer-
tainly a lot of fun to have pictures to
show the folks at home.

What’s the trick of taking good pic-
tures on vacation?

As a matter of fact, there isn’t any
reason whatsoever why anyone, in
these days of good inexpensive cam-
eras and Elm, shouldn’t return from
vacation with a batch of fme snap-
shots or good movies or color slides.
Follow a few easy rules and it is prac-
tically guaranteed that you will be re-
warded with the best souvenir snap-
shots you’ve taken:

Before you leave for Lake Mitiwan-
ga’s Cozy-Comfort Cabins, or Wood-
wild-in-the-Trees at Wild Waves, have

your camera checked at your local

160

camera store. This is particularly nec-

essary if you are one of those persons
who makes the mistake of leaving it in
the dark fastness of the hall closet for
months on end. If you have the chance,
take a few test shots before you leave.

Unless you are a very experienced
amateur, buy a pocket-size exposure
guide in your local store. It costs
only a quarter and covers practically
every exposure problem. And speak-
ing of exposure, ever take the time to
read the instructions which come with
every roll of Elm? You’d be surprised
how many pe0ple ignore such helpful
information from the fllm manufac-
turer. If your only experience with
picture-taking has been aiming a box
brownie and clicking the shutter, the
prospect of learning about shutter
speeds, f stop Openings, iilm speeds,
and so on, shouldn’t overwhelm you.
This little guide will do the thinking
for you.

Unless your camera will take pic-
tures at 1/100 or 1/200 of a second,
avoid taking action passing directly
across the view of the camera. How-
ever, even with the simplest flxed-fo-
cus cameras you can catch walkers,
runners, bicyclists or boats directly
approaching or retreating at moderate
speeds.

Learn to use a fllter on your camera
with black-and-white film for outdoor
shots. The light yellow (K2) is the
most popular and brings out cloud ef-
fects and dramatically darkens the

sky.

 

En route to ‘your vacation location.

whether you use a plane, train, ship
or family auto, take plenty of pictures.
Make the transportation part of your
vacation snapshot record.

Three professional “Do’s” for the
amateur photographers on vacation to_
remember are: “Steady does it”—
brace the camera flrmly against your
body (or brow or cheekbone. if it is
the eye-level type), hold your breath
for the instant it takes to click the
shutter. Never hand-hold your camera
when shooting at less than 1/25 of a
second. At lower shutter speeds use a

number after taking a picture to avoid
double exposure and “Keep your dis-
tance”—six feet is as close as you can
get with most inexpensive cameras.
Don’t feel duty-bound when you
take snapshots to have the sun behind
you. That’s the old fashioned, and
less interesting, way to take snapshots.
Such “flat” lighting as it is called is
good for color photography. but it is
deadening in black-and-white work.
Snap your pictures with the sunlight
to the side of the subject to bring out
detail and create light and shadow ef-
fects which make for artistic values.
Remember that high noon is an un-
flattering time for snapshots of people.
Direct overhead light puts hard shad-
ows and black eyes on even the pret-
tiest faces, unless you’re at the beach
or a lake where sand and water reflect
the light upward. In the middle of the

If you are really serious about get-

to plan your picture-taking ahead of

less some member of your group is in

scenic snapshot, such as one of the
Grand Canyon, is only mildly inter-
esting to your friends back home but
becomes very interesting if Sister Sue
and Brother Bill are shown standing

cares about a snapshot of the Statue of

silly to make people stand helplessly
and foolishly, grinning self-conscious-
ly into your camera. How much more
interesting to show them feeding thc
bears in the national parks, buying
hotdogs at the beach refreshment
stand, unloading the luggage from the
rear of the car or any of the thousand
and one things a vacation entails.

If you want to get your vacation
snapshots out of the realm of the or-
dinary and commonplace, pay a little

attention to composition. Knowing

'composition makes for most of the

difference between the amateur pho-
tographer and the professional.

It means arranging the elements in
your photograph to give the viewer a
pleasing effect. In most instances try
to take the snapshot at a vantage point
which, because of framing, lines or
curves, gives the shot the effect of
forming a design.

An elemental aspect of good design

is the framing of your photograph
with a tree, an archway, or side of a
building. One side of the picture
could be “framed” in this fashion, or
the top and the side.

Another way to insure good compo-

sition is to show lines or curves in the
foreground leading toward the main

son and daughter, or perhaps your son
with the family dog,'tramping down
the road toward the farmhouse—you’ll
have a picture which you’ll want
framed for the living room back
home!

One thing more. Don’t be afraid to
take plenty of pictures. The cost of
the film, deveIOping and printing is in-
finitesimal compared to the fun you’ll
get in the years ahead, reliving the
vacation pleasures of your past holi-
days.

Designs for

Recreation Building

0 A progressive city (40,000 population)* in the cen-
tral part of the state is in need of a recreation building.

The City Planning Commission includes in its schedule
for civic improvements a comprehensive re-deveIOpment
program, new housing, additional sh0pping, and com-
mercial facilities (including offstreet parking), recreation
and other important elements, one of which is the recrea-
tion center. The purpose of this center is to deve|0p a
good healthy community spirit by providing a meeting
place for the men, women, and children. . . . It will be
a place where the people can get acquainted and where
they can pursue hobbies and cultural desires.

Thus read the 1952 announcement of the John W. Ma-

loney Competition for third year design students in the
department of architectural engineering at Washington
State College.

The problem of the competition was to design a recrea-
tion center on a city block, 250 by 400 feet, with major
streets forming the long boundary and secondary streets at
each end, in a redevelopment project partially subsidized
by community and state. Existing buildings were in poor
condition and all structures were to be removed. The
problem was a regular class exercise and took the students
about four and one-half weeks to complete. Plans winning
first place are reproduced on opposite page.

John W. Maloney, a Seattle and Yakima architect who
has been the designer of a number of the Washington State
College buildings, has been sponsoring such competitions

“ Students were told that the recreation building was to be suit-
able for a city about the size of Yakima, Washington. According to
the latest census, Yakima has a population of about 40,000.

 

MRS. RUTH E. PIKE is recreation specialist in the Wash-
ington State Parks and Recreation Commission, Seattle.

A Recreation Contest
conducted in School of Architecture

among students in the department of architectural engi
neering at the college for a number of years. Several sucl
competitions are held each year, each one in a differem
class. Mr. Maloney does not select the problems, but con
tributes the money for the awards. The faculty decides
on the problems after receiving suggestions from students

According to Stanley A. Smith, chairman of the depart
ment of architectural engineering, and Thorkel A. Haa
land, instructor in the third year design class which tack
led the problem, the recreation center was selected it
order to acquaint people with the needs for recreatior
buildings as well as to emphasize to the student architec1
his responsibility in filling that need to the best of his
ability.

Specifications—The requirements for the building, fron
which each student worked, were as follows:

First Floor

Public entrance and stair hall.

OBices for director and secretary with small storage area am
record room.

Lounge divided into areas for reading, quiet games, and con
versation (approximately 800 square feet).

Gymnasium, small kitchen and observation area adjacent.

Swimming pool accommodating six lanes, adequate circulatior
around pool.

Lockers, showers.and dressing rooms for boys and girls, to serve
swimming pool and gymnasium jointly (approximately 350 square
feet).

Control and supervision ofiice for athletic instructor, centrally
located to gymnasium and pool (approximately 100 square feet)
with supply room for equipment adjacent.

Four game rooms for ping pong, checkers, and so on.

Two four-wall handball courts.

Crafts and hobby shop with lockers for supplies and tools (ap
proximately 400 square feet) with adjacent storeroom.

Sun decks for men and women.

Necessary toilet rooms, closets, and so on.

The specifications also stated that if the designer wished

Janitors’ quarters.
Storage space.

Out-of-doors

Out—door gymnasium for men.

Out-door gymnasium for women.
Out-door playground for children.
Children’s wading pool and sand courts.
Athletic field.

Fixed dimensions for activity areas were kept at a mini-
mum in the specifications to permit freedom in planning
and study of the importance of the different elements, but
students were told to keep in mind that out-door play-
ground space was important; therefore, building area on
the spot should be kept at a minimum.

The department of architectural engineering also re»
quested consultation services from the chairman of the
department of physical education for men, in the School
of Physical Education and Athletics, to get his point of
view regarding features that would serve the need best. A
graduate student in the department also assisted in the

consultation.

Students Formulated Own Plan—Each student was
encouraged to formulate his own plan, based on consulta-
tion and on the results of his own research into what would
be the most satisfactory solution. Within reason, each one
was free to select his own materials, keeping in mind that
lower cost durable materials were probably the most prac-
tical for a public building of this kind; for example,

ceramics tile, asbestos type materials, and so on would be
good. Construction was to be in keeping with open plan-
ning, using open glass areas, steel trusses, laminated tim-
ber arches, and the like.

The specifications required the following of each student
in presenting his solution:

Problem presented on a 30 by 40 inch illustrating board
in any medium desired.

Perspective view.

Two elevations not shown in perspective at 1/8”=—_
1’—0”.

Floor plans at 1/16” = 1’—0”.

Section at 1/16” = 1’——0”.

Plot plan at 1” = 50’.

,Basis of Judging Plans—The twenty-one plans submit-

ted were judged on (I) the best solution to the problem;
(2) relationship of areas for the most functional use; ( 3)
aesthetic qualities of elevations and buildings as a whole;
and (4) presentation, both pictorial delineation and drafts-
manship. After the awards were made, the entries were
studied and criticized by the class and the faculty.

Winners—First place winner of the competition was
Cyrus Clark, Kilmarnock, Virginia, who received an award
of $75. Grant F. Groesbeck, Provo, Utah, and Harlow E.
Walla, Vancouver, Washington, tied for second place, and
split the awards for second and third place to receive $42.50
each. W. Robert Sinclair, Opportunity, Washington, re-
ceived $25 and fourth place, and Kiyue Richard Kishi,
Stevenston, British Columbia, was in fifth place and re-
ceived $15. Earl Muir, Pullman, Washington and Verne
Chone, Boise, Idaho, received honorable mention.

The Lament of a Playground Director

It’s really astounding

The pep unabounding

That fills the whole playground galore.
The kiddies are bouncing

The teeters are trouncing

And yet they come back for some

more.

Now here are the swingers

The all-around slingers

That never givc up and say die.
When rainy or foggy

They swing till they’re groggy
And stagger out saying goodbye.

The slides have their faddists
I may call ’em saddists
Because of their “devil-may-care”!

The acrobats worstest,
That slide down head firstest,
Are really my greatest dispair!

 

Now just think of skating

A sport with high rating

All action and never a lull.
These skaters try flying,

Ground contact defying,

They’re Jets—bombers being too dull.
The sand-box seems quiet . . .
You’re wrong . . . It’s a riot,
The babies are having their fling.
They eat sand and shovels;
They blow gritty bubbles;

And sand in the eye is the thing!

Equipment is joyful

It’s girlful and boyful

A playground of fun every day.

They go through their paces

With bright happy faces,

When they use everything the wrong
way . . . l!

Yet, each summer sees an annual

BEHAVIOR

happy souls, who, when face to face
with grandeur, reSpond only to the
urge to mutilate or destroy.”

When many parents, teachers and
other leaders conduct themselves no
better than do their erstwhile charges,
small wonder that a display of poor
outdoor manners has become almost
characteristic of American youth. Each
summer throughout our great out-of-
doors is left a trail of trampled flowers,
littered lawns and campsites, broken
and painted rock formations, trash-
dammed springs and pools, initial-
scarred trees and signs, mutilated camp
facilities—all attesting to a lack of re-
sponsible democracy.

Vandalism, be it some slight act of
thoughtlessness, or an act of wanton
destruction is a reflection on our ste-
wardship as citizens. Much damage is
averted through the surveillance of park
police, rangers, and wardens; more ef-
fective, and in the long run more eco-
nomical,is the control achieved through
self-regulation. Effective education of
the potential offender rather than pun-
ishment of the vandal makes for the
best long range control. Such educa-
tion must have its roots in the home as
well as in the school and other com-
munity groups.

It may flatter a parent when Junior
emulates him, and this pride is justi-
fied when children have learned by ex-
ample to “police up” after the picnic
without being asked to do so. But if

the children do as Daddy does and
throw trash from the car window, an-
other little “litter bug” is in the mak-
ing. The parent who pauses to pick up
papers strewn about the park sites is
teaching a far different lesson from
that taught by the family leaving a
roadside table littered with watermelon
rinds. The personal habits of the na-
tion are such that it has been suggested
that cleansing tissue could well be our
national flower, because it is found
blooming along practically every high-
way—even underground in such tour-
ist-frequented spots as Mammoth Cave
and Carlsbad Caverns.

Careless habits like those of throw-
ing paper to the wind are not as seri-
ous as are the vandalistic acts of de-
facing petroglyphs, souvenir swiping
——-be it of roadsigns or petrified wood
——-and the painting of Indian writings
or the leaving of lipstick marks upon
historic shrines. Often it seems that the
more firmly fixed and. the more inac-
cessible the object, the greater the
challenge to the vacation vandal.

Some effort to furnish harmless out-
lets to those who have strong desires
to destroy has been made in the estab-
lishment of “rumpus ranges” in the
Michigan parks; other areas have pro-
vided “whittlng blocks” on which the
penknife vandal can give vent to his
urge to carve and initial. Perhaps a
Scout award for improved outdoor be-
havior might be better; it would serve

165

to mitigate the growing dislike on part
of park pe0ple for the visits of organi-
zations and other groups of energetic
but thoughtless adolescents. Their ten.
dencies to break into small rival teams
intent upon mischief makes their con-
trol partieularly difficult in park areas.
When their leaders can make them un-
derstand the “why” for not picking
flowers and why the trapping and ston~
ing of squirrels is taboo, the boys are
more likely to c00perate—and even
help restrain others of their group
from doing damage.

Some improvement has been noted
in the outdoor manners of Americans
in the last few years—though the
hordes of hunters each autumn still too
often practice a wanton disregard for
either private or public pr0perty. Yet

ive “Don’t Be A Litterbug” drive, are
helping to focus public attention on the
problem of curbing the careless van-
dal—just as the “Smoky Bear” posters
and stickers have helped in reminding
a thoughtless public of its individual

responsibility in preventing forest fires.

'Thanks to a persistent well directed

program, most Americans have be-
come more conscious of their duty in
helping prevent fires, just as nations
such as Switzerland have developed
public manners to the extent that very
few parks and public areas there will
be found littered. Yet, progress in
stimulating better outdoor manners on
the part of many Americans may seem
painfully slow to the park attendant so
close to the problem on his Monday
morning-after cleanup of roadsides
and campsites strewn with shiny beer
cans and Sunday comic pages.

In a little Texas store on the Mexi-
can border one may yet see an occa-
sional sign reading “Favor-No-Escupir
En-el-piso.” It is to serve as instruction
to the wetbacks (native Mexicans wad-
ing the Rio Grande) that they are not
to Spit on the floor. In most sections of
our country such signs would be con-
sidered highly unnecessary; yet in the
19th century, spitting was one of the
most prevalent and objectional habits

noted by visitors from abroad. Today,
it “just isn’t done,” as social pressure
does not tolerate such conduct. Per-
haps in the coming years we will have
progressed to the point where we will
look back 011 present day disregard
for public pr0perty in our parks in the
same light as we now look on the un
sanitary expectorating of our for
fathers.

The day when our outdoor manner
match the behavior we expect of pe
ple indoors will be hastened if on
nature-loving Americans will encour
age, by example, all to help “Keel

OUTBOARDS—by the millions

Nathan L. Mallison

My first recollection of an outboard
motor was on the Erie Canal when I
was ,a boy of eleven. I saw a church
deacon trying to get one started and
then listened to his Opinion of it when
it failed to percolate. Considerable
progress has been registered since the
days when man exhausted himself get-
ting one of those cantankerous con~
traptions running. My little put-put
may stay in the garage several months
without use; yet when I hangit on the
stern of my craft, it rarely takes over
two pulls on the starter cord to set it
purring in beautiful rhythm.

Out in the South Pacific, it was not

uncommon to see two-hundred-foot

sectional barges pushed by the Paul"

Bunyan of all outboards, with a prop
as big as a tug boat. A friend of mine
has a half horsepower job that doesn’t
weigh any more than a pair of ash
oars. Standard models enjoying a
large sale run from 1%: to 25 horse-
power. Larger ones are available.
The outboard makes a good auxil-

166

iary power unit on a sleek sailing
yacht. Small sailing craft, going to
and from races find it advantageous
to hook up a string of class boats with
an outboard on the leader.

Several years ago on Lake Poinsett
I noticed a houseboat moving along
at a fair clip. It had three outboards
on the fantail which carried a dr0p
rack at just the right height to im-
merse up to five outboards.

Recently, a father, wanting to give
his children a little adventure a la
Mark Twain, built a raft of oil drums
with conical ends welded on them. On
this raft he pitched a tent and at the
stern placed a reliable outboard with
controls forward. After a number of
days he docked at New Orleans with a
thousand miles of “Old Man River”
behind him and many years ahead as
the greatest dad in the world to his
own children who shared the great
adventure.

The more than three million out-
boards manufactured since the second

world war have been responsible for
democracy afloat. Back yards have:
become anchorages light,-I
speedy hull on a trailer, ready to be
towed to interesting waterways within
a two hundred mile radius any week-
end. Many a water lover with neither
the social standing or the cash to sport
a yacht club burgee, can fly the pen-
nant of the OBC (Outboard Boating
Club of America) and join with hun-
dreds of others using the waterways
for recreation.

Water trails are nature’s highways
in the unspoiled out-of-doors. Most
of the pe0ple found on them enjoy
themselves, are courteous to others
afloat and considerate of the fisher-
man on the shore. There are no stop
lights, no traffic to be held up if you
want to glide along at six miles an
hour, no horns blo'wing if you stop to

fish or take a picture.
For the more adventurous and dar.

ing there are outboard racing, aqua-
planing, water skiing and tow gliding.

Model of Sunset Community Center with 10 square blocks (43

acres) integrated into one site.

There are provisions for off-

street parking and tree planting for windbreaks. Sloping site is
arranged in three level areas. Many facilities will be jointly used,
affording economical full-time use of all land. Building areas are:
1, Senior High School; 2, Junior High School; 3, Swimming Pool;
4, Public Health; 5, Recreation Building and 6, Elementary School.

San Francisco, California

The Sunset Community Center, a
joint undertaking of. the board of ed-
ucation, the recreation department and
the health department, has been char-

“the

American dream of a community cen-

acterized as the realization of

ter serving the needs of all age'levels.”
This project is being deve10ped on a
forty-three-acre site according to a
cooperative plan that has been evolved
by municipal and school authorities
under the sponsorship of the depart-
ment of city planning, with the strong
support of the city’s art commission
and the guidance of a group of coor-
dinating architects.

The buildings planned for the ten-
liloclc center include a junior high
school, an elementary school, a senior
high school, a recreation building with
assembly hall, game rooms and show-
ers, and a health clinic. Outdoor fa-
cilities include a playground, paved

areas for games, fields for sports and
a stadium. The facilities in the recrea-
tion building will be used by the ele-
mentary school; the playfields will be
available for students, teen-agers, and
community groups; and adult pro-
grams as well as school activities will
be carried on in the auditoriums,

gymnasiums and cafeterias.

Several advantages were evident in
the proposal for a unified community
center, encompassing a number of ex-
isting city blocks. They are indicated
as follows by Paul Opperman, direc-
tor of planning.*

1. Closing of the traversing streets would
add suhstantially to the land area of the
site, without extra cost.

2. Street closures would increase pedes-
trian safety for those going from one build-
ing to -anothcr within the unified site.

3. Through-traHic would avoid the streets
closed off, so that their value as quiet resi-
dential streets would he enhanced.

4. Combined use could be made of some

facilities if grouped together, thus eliminat-
ing unnecessary duplication. Athletic facili-
ties, swimming pool, playfields, all of the
school, and landscaped open spaces would
serve the recreation center as well. School
auditoriums and cafeterias could be used in
conjunction with events held in the recrea-
tion center.

5. The grouping of facilitics would make
the area a focal point for all community
recreation, social, cultural, and civic ac-
tivities.

6. A public improvement of distinctive
character and greater beauty could be

achieved at less cost than if undertaken
singly.

Nearly one-quarter of the forty-
three-acre site will be controlled by
the recreation and park department,
less than one-half an acre by the health
department, and the balance by the
school district. Grading, parking and
other improvement costs are shared
among the three departments in pro-
portion to the allocated area. In the
deveIOpment of the basic site plan
careful consideration was given to the
relationships of buildings and recrea-
tion areas with reference to the needs
of the. respective groups. The stadium,
for example, has been located for
proximity to the future high school
gymnasiums and the swimming pool
between the junior and senior high
school so both student groups may be

served. The recreation building,

167

which is at a focal point in the total
scheme, is connected to the public
swimming pool by a terrace.

According to Dr. N. L. Engelhardt,

Sr., educational consultant, “Few com-
munities in America have as significant
and comprehensive a community cen-
ter as this. The vision came first, the
organization for action was set into
motion, the cooperation of many pro-
fessional people is making the vision
a reality.”

Glencoe, Glenview, and
Wilmette, Illinois

These three suburban communities
in the Chicago region afford illustra-
tions of effective c00peration between
school and park authorities.

In 1935 the park board and the
school board in Glencoe agreed that
the park district should have complete
charge of the pr0perty surrounding
schools and that the boards should
jointly plan for the deve10pment and
maintenance of facilities for parks,
education and recreation. It was fur-
ther decided that the new school build-
ings then being planned would be so
designed as to provide for community
activities at such times as not needed
for education. Under this plan, the
school board provides all indoor rec-
reation facilities and the park board
provides all outdoor facilities at the

the deve10pment of a comprehensive
long-term plan based on educational
and recreational requirements were
recognized as an efficient, economical
and intelligent way of doing business.
Glencoe reports that this cooperation
and coordination have provided the
community with better facilities at a
lower cost and with more efficient Op-

plated.

than was

An interesting legal working agree-
ment, designed to benefit both the park
and the school districts and to reduce
maintenance costs, has been reached
between the Glenview Park District
and the Community Consolidated
School, District #34. The agreement,
which is binding for a period of twen-
ty-five years, provides that the school
board shall turn over its school ground
property (located on three new school

168

sites) to the Glenview Park District to
equip, construct, maintain, landscape
and operate for joint school and park
district recreational purposes. Ac-
cording to the lease the cost for de-
velopment of these new school sites
will be paid by the park district. In
addition the joint- use of the
grounds, the buildings will be offered
to the park district, when not serving

to

school purposes, free of charge for
community recreational purposes.

At the close of the twenty-five year
period the school board agrees to re-
new the lease for a second twenty-five
year period should the park district
desire to exercise this option. In other
words the school board has commit-
ted its“ grounds for recreational pur-
poses for the next fifty years. How-
ever, the park district is only held for
its share of the lease for thc next
twenty-five years. i

The “ideal—and highly practical”
plan of providing park areas contigu-
ous to school grounds is admirably il-
lustrated at several Wilmette schools,
according to a General Plan Study
prepared by the local planning board.
It states: “Experience has shown that
cooperation and joint responsibility of
the school board and the park board
for developing and maintaining recre-
ational property results in better fa-
cilities for both recreational and
school needs, and at a much lower
cpst than required to; finance sepa-
rated parks and playgrounds.”

Detroit, Michigan

Detroit’s Cannon Memorial Recrea-
tion Center is the result of joint plan-
ning and financing by the department
of parks and recreation and the board
of education. It has been designed for
maximum use as a recreation center
for the entire community. The idea
for this building came about because
an elementary school needed a gym-
nasium and the parks and recreation
department needed a gymnasium and
auditorium and certain additidnal fa-
cilities in the same neighborhood. In
considering how the two departments
could share expense, save the taxpay-
ers money and secure a more adequate
center it was discovered: (1) The Fin-
ney School required only a small gym-

nasium and an auditorium, but i
could get along without other extras
(2) The board of education had on]:
about $200,000 to spend. (3) Th.
parks people needed a large gymna
sium. (4) The board, which receive.
part of its funds from the state, wa:
bound by a state law prohibiting tlu
use of school money for constructior
on land not owned by the school sys
tem. (5) The parks department owner
all the land adjacent to the school an(
was reluctant to sell because no otheJ
property suitable for a communitj
center was available. (6) The pro]!
lem of properly apportioning maint

"'nance and repair costs in such a joint
project was regarded as knotty, if no:
insoluble.

After many conferences it was dis
covered that the state law could be
circumvented. The parks departmenl
could build the recreation center, give
the school system a fifty-year lease on
portions of the building, and collect a
$195,000 rental from the school board.
The rental could be paid in a lump
sum and applied to the cost of con-
struction. Practically, the rental would
give the school system part ownership
of a gymnasium, an auditorium and a
lunch room.

With the legal problem out of the
way, the two departments. were able
to resolve theiriother differences. lt
was agreed that the gymnasium should
be built to parks department specifica-
tions. During school hours the Fin-
ney School would use the center’s
gymnasium, and lunch
room. The parks department would
pay approximately $600,000 covering
its share of the cost of the three joint-

ly-used facilities and the complete cost

auditorium

of play rooms, exercise rooms, lockers
and shower rooms, offices and crafts
equipment.

The new building offers the best in
recreational facilities to school chil-
dren of the northeast section and a
program of leisure-time activities for
the parents and grandparents of these
children. As a result of the experience
with this project the two departments
have agreed that whenever the board
of education plans to bliild a new
school the parks department should be
consulted. Several projects like Can-

and school authorities, and voluntary
agencies in the District of Columbia.

The members of this committee in-
clude: the superintendent and assist-
'l'nt superintendent of the recreation
department; the landscape architect
for the National Capital Planning
Commission; the assistant superinten-
dent and chief of planning for the
National Capital Parks Office; the as-
sociate superintendent in charge of

These individuals are officially des-
ignated by their respective organiza-
tions, so the committee has real stand-

ing.
Functions of this committee include

viewed by the committee with partic-
ular emphasis on the inclusion of
community recreation facilities within
the school structure.

Agreements on use, design, and lo-
cation of areas and facilities are the
basis of recommendations to the re-
spective bodies concerned. The devel-
opment of the District Recreation
System Plan is a continuing item in
the thinking and planning of the com-
mittee.

Oakland, California

Amendment of the State School
Code was essential in carrying out a
c00perative project in Oakland involv-
ing the construction of a municipal
swimming pool on property owned by
the local board of education. At a mu-
nicipal bond election in May, 1945, a
bond issue for $600,000 to construct
five swimming pools, one adjacent to
each of the five high schools of Oak-
land, was approved by the voters. The
Mayor’s Swimming Pool Committee,
appointed by the mayor with the ap-

proval of the city council to push for-
ward the project, included representa-
tives of the school and recreation de-
partments and interested local agen-
cies.

Onc site presented a problem be-
cause it was owned by the board of
education, but the municipal bonds
could be spent only for improvements
to property either owned by the city
or held by it under a long-term lease.
This problem was solved, however, by
the passage of permissive legislation
making it possible for school districts
to lease unused and unneeded prop-
erty on long-term basis to municipal-
ities, counties or other school districts
for general public welfare uses. Un-
der this legislation, a forty-year lease,
which was the term of the swimming
pool bonds, was negotiated between

the Oakland School District and the

Oakland High School District and the

City of Oakland, represented by its
board of playground directors. The
lease provided that the city would
erect on the property a pool and re-
lated buildings and operate them for
public use, and that the board of ed-
ucation would have the right to use
the pools during the regular school
day.

A working agreement has been ne-
gotiated between the board of play-
ground directors and the board of ed-
ucation covering the jurisdiction, pol-
icies, operation and maintenance of
the pool. The school department is to
have the use of the pool from 9:00
AM. to 3:00 P.M. during regular
school terms on school days and to
furnish at its own expense swimming
instructors, attendants and suits and
towels, if required in connection with
this use. The recreation department
will bear all costs for personnel and
Operation of the pool when used for
public recreation and has the final
authority on questions of pool policy
and schedules. Regular maintenance
costs are carried by the recreation de-
partment, but are prorated with the
school department at the end of each
semester.

Los Angeles, California

Los Angeles also affords an exam-
ple of cooperation in the financing of
a swimming pool, only in this instance

169

the facility is being built on city prOp-
erty. The city has acquired 125 acres,
half of it under water, adjoining a
site on which the board of education
built its Harbor Junior College. The
department of recreation and parks
had planned to build an outdoor swim-
ming pool in this general area, but
through a joint agreement with the
board of arrangements
have been made to build a year-round
enclosed pool. The department is to
build the pool, and the board of ed-
ucation is to pay the additional cost
resulting from the construction of an
enclosed pool. The city will be re-
sponsible for the maintenance of the
swimming pool at all times, but the
board of education will occupy it dur-
ing the school term and the depart-
ment of recreation and parks will use
it throughout the summer months.

Muskegon, Michigan

COOperation in Muskegon is facili-
tated through the joint employment of

a landscape architect by the board of '

education and the department of parks
and recreation. The landscape archi-
tect does the planning for new areas
and for improvements on present
prOperties of both the department of
parks and recreation and the board of
education. It is reportedly a bigger
job than one man can handle, and
joint employment of a draftsman to
assist him is anticipated. According
to Chase H. Hammond, director of
the department of parks and recrea-
tion, consideration is heing given to
the possible feasibility of the depart-
ment taking over the entire mainte-
nance of school grounds, regardless of
whether or not they are used for rec-
reation purposes, on the assumption
that every public prOperty which has
any area at all should be considered
as a park and beautified and made
useful accordingly.

The drawing board and files of the
landscape architect are located in the
office of the department of parks and
recreation and he participates regu-
larly in staff meetings of the depart-
ment. He also meets frequently with
the business manager of the public
schools and discusses mutual proh-
lems with him and with the park and

recreation director. He is under civil

170

service, is paid from the department
payroll and has pension rights as a
city employee. At the end of each
year the department of parks and rec-
reation bills the board of education
for half of his salary plus extras such
as the use of a car and Office material.

In view of the fact that. the board of
education is in the process of present-
ing a seven-million-dollar school im-
provement plan to the public in thc
spring of 1953; the director of parks
and recreation is working closely with
both the superintendent of schools and
the business manager in making sure
that the indoor and outdoor relation-
ships are studied thoroughly. The di-
rector states: “The business manager
has asked us for a written outline of
the things we think important in plan-
ning these new school buildings and
I believe every attempt will be made
to see that they are fulfilled. He has
even suggested that they take out of
the general contract the landscape and
building of the outdoor playfield fa-

cilities and give us that responsibil-
ity.”

Dallas, Texas

The cooperative use of properties in—

.volving both the park and school sys-

tems has been common procedure in
Dallas for many years. The arrange-
ment is a rather informal one based
on mutual understanding. However,
as early as 1930 the park board and
the board of education passed a reso-
lution authorizing the erection, oper-
ation and maintenance by the park
board on school prOperties of wading
pools, tennis courts and other facili-
ties for joint use by the schools and
by children attending the public parks.

In many instances the park board
and the school board have acquired
adjoining sites and in recent years all
adjoin each other
without separation by public streets
or roadways. The lands are owned
separately. The park board, in the
deve10pment of its prOperties, provides

such prOperties

equipment and apparatus for general
community use, but coordinates it
with the school’s playground program.

In Conclusion

The preceding examples of coopera-
tive action on the part of school and

city authorities in the acquisition, de«
velOpment and operation of indoor
and outdoor facilities designed f0]
both school and community use illus
trate that where there is a will a way
can be found to achieve the desired re
sults. They reveal a variety of pro
cedural patterns, forms of agreemen
and division of responsibility ant
costs. They make it clear that school

ognize the value of progressive steps
in instruction and testing in water-
front activities, but not as often do we
find them making the same plans for
safeguarding youngsters in equally
hazardous activities involving tools or
fires. For some reason there are those
who feel that it is most unwise for a
youngster to venture into deep water
until hc has proved that he can take
care of himself, yet have no qualms
about letting novices head off on over-
night hikes without proper progressive
instruction and testing in the many
skills that will assure a happy and
safe expcrience.

Program areas usually known as

a sound plan of instruction, for prac-
tice and testing in skills, with due em-
phasis on safety and good progression.

Many camps follow such a plan; in
many there are definite requirements
to be met before certain out-of-camp
trips may be undertaken. Such'pro-
gressive steps serve as a check list for
increasing skill and knowledge and
stimulate campers to expand their
camping fun. At the same time they
highlight the safety factors that are
necessary to good use of skills; for
example, safety in using tools, safety
in building fires, safety in handling
food. When camps reach the point of
requiring definite knowledge, skill,
and experience before a youngster un-
dertakes
camp-craft will reach the same peak

as have waterfront activities.

General Considerations

The following is an outline of im-
portant points to be considered in con-
nection with any campcraft program
where progression and safety are de-
sired.

1. Activities: demonstrations of ac-
cepted methods of using tools and
equipmcnt; Opportunity for individ-
uals to practice under supervision of a
qualified counselor; discussion of
safety factors and reasons for them;
group formulation of regulations for
care and use of equipment and for
progressive steps in testing ability of
campers and in undertaking new ex-
periences; emphasis on habits and at-
titudes that may carry over into beha-
vior and activity after the camp sea-

son.

2. Leadership: supervision that is
adequate for the particular age group
involved, not only technically quali-
fied in the areas of activity but also
aware of the safety factors and the po-
tentials in adventure and fun.

3. Size of group: small enough to
allow good participation by each
camper; smaller for younger children
to permit adequate supervision; in
general, limited so as not to tax the
facilities at hand. (A basic ratio of
one counselor for each five to ten
campers is suggested. However, this
ratio will vary with different activi-
ties.)

eryday facilities and equipment. Thus,
learning to “live” with canvas and
how to handle guy r0pes, cabin shut-
ters, or canvas curtains may be in-
cluded in orientation. “Campkeeping”
chores may present problems in learn-
ing to use equipment, but systematic
instruction will help prevent unhappy
occurrences.

From another point of view, there
should be early instruction regarding
camp experience with accidents or ill-
ness. Learning to reCOgnize poison
ivy and being informed about spiders,
snakes, and skunks may make for se-
curity in the newness of camp and
serve to prevent accidents or illness.
What to do in case of a cut and other
first-aid matters may well be covered

in early discussion.

Outdoor Cooking

Progression should be applied to
cooking activities so that campers will
gradually become proficient in han-
dling themselves around the outdoor
kitchen and fire. Planning for outdoor
food should include discussion of bal-
anced meals and avoidance of food
that may spoil easily; packing to en-
sure efficient carrying and safe arrival
at the cookout spot, and proper stor-
age at the hike site. A good cookout
will depend, finally, on safe and ade-
quate fireplaces and supervision of in-
dividual cooking to be sure that the
campers get good meals. Cleaning up
should be done by the campers and the
staff and should include such good
practices as burning or burial of uref-
use and sterilization of milk cans.

Siamese Centipede Six people, “cen-
tipedes,” form a team and get astride a
ten-foot pole, three facing forward and
three backward. At the signal, each
centipede races to a goal and, without
turning around, returns to the starting
line. The first team to return without
mishaps is the winner.

I Know This is similar to “I like
coffee, but 1 don’t like tea,” where the
trick is to avoid words with a “t” in
them. In this game, no word with the
letter “i” in it is correct. The leader
agrees to let the group join the 1 Know

Fire Building

Given a good fireplace, there is still
need to control fire, to keep kettles
from spilling over, to brace big frying
pans, to‘make adequate cranes, and
so forth. Fireplaces should be set up
so as to make it easy for a group to
gather around for individual cooking.
Woodpiles should be stacked for
handy use but in such a way as to
prevent tripping over loose branches.
And, of course, there should be places
for necessary tools such as a chop-
ping-block for axes. Progression in
the use of these tools is desirable; for
example, progression from small axes
to heavier axes. Often in camp there
is a fire area where a large space has
been cleared for practice; sometimes
demonstration fires are shown here. It
is important to emphasize at this time
the danger in campfires that send
showers of sparks into pine trees.

Cross-Country Going

Traveling in the unknown, by trails,
on treasure hunts, with maps or com-
pass, is a fascinating activity that calls
for preparedness in terms of skill, en-
durance, and mental outlook. In a
sense, this activity is a culmination of
previous instruction, for it may entail
every important camping skill, partic-
ularly in the event of a camper be-
coming separated from his group. The
latter possibility, of course, is extreme-
ly remote if instruction has been pro-
gressive and thorough, with due con-
sideration for safety. But interesting-
ly enough, the camper who has re-
ceived such instruction is well pre-
pared in the event that he does find

himself alone with nature.

RECREATIO,

 

NOBODY WORKS all of the time. Everybody plays some

of the time. Everybody, in all ages, has played some
of the time. A lot of that play, grouped with all sorts of
leisure time pursuits, is now called “recreation.” By no
means all, but nonetheless a considerable part, of recrea-
tion is carried on as a community enterprise. The respon-
sibility for the conduct of community recreation is usually
divided between government agencies and voluntary group
agenc1es.

How much money should be spent separately and col-
lectively by these agencies is a speculative question con-
cerning which responsible professional organizations are
reluctant to advise. In the expectation that specific sug-
gestions by individuals may provoke others to announce
other opinions and so gradually assemble accepted guides,
some spccifics are ventured in this article.

Acceptance and Growth of
Community Responsibility

There was a time in human history when very little in
the way of recreation was done in common as a community
enterprise, but there probably has never been a time, so
long as people associated with each other, when some pro-
visions for group recreation have not been available to
rather large gatherings by the grace of powerful and
wealthy individuals. Often, the public was permitted to
participate.

Puhlic responsibility for certain phases of recreation
was assumed when government by the people became es-
tablished in the latter part of the eighteenth century. In
general, it was then that the first publicly-owned parks
werc establishcd. The basis for thein was recreation in
several of its presently recognized aspects: a locale for

certain games, a contrast of nature as against the crowded

city, beauty of environment, sites for music, drama and
other cultural entertainment, opportunity for eating out-
of-doors. Justification for them was often based on the
demonstrated fact that their establishment enhanced prop-
erty values so much that the cost was no public burden—a
theory that is still sound. .

The number and character of such recreation facilities
and the varied character of recreation as now promoted by
governmental and voluntary agencies have expanded to
include a great many of the human activities which are re-
sorted to in an ever-expanding amount of leisure time.
The expanding process is still going on and is distinctly
measurable, even over the short period of a decade.

In the republics of today, such expansion is not possible
except by the will of the people. It can therefore be as-
enmed that the amount and kind of recreation that a com-
munity should provide is not a static measurement of do]-
lars per capita or percentage of productive wealth, but is
an ever-changing amount in a progressive and dynamic
society. However, from the experience of many communi-
ties and the expressed desires of many organized segments
of many urban centers, some very general guides applic-
able to the present day may be obtained. It should be em-
phasized that these guides are not standards that are to be
accepted by, or applied to, all localities, large and small,
in all quarters of the continent, because each community
retains the prerogative of rejecting even what may be good
for it or embracing that which others think is bad for it.
For some, these guides may be goals to be hoped for and
worked for. Others may push beyond. In my opinion,
they are reasonable objectives.

173

Some Special Suggested Norms

In various nationally distributed booklets, certain guides
for amount, character, and distribution of recreation fa-
cilities and services for cities are given. Topography and
other physical aspects, as well as the sociological compo-
sition of cities, may cause considerable deviation in the
application of these guides. A few cities of over a million
or thereabouts may justify such unusual features as plane-
taria, stadia, and large museums of one sort or another
which are not required in smaller cities. Only profession-
ally-conducted surveys will reveal all the justifiable devia-
tions. But the broad averages therein expressed define, in

general terms, a community of good recreation Opportuni-
ties.

RECREATIOI

THE MATURING of
GOLDEN-AGE CAMPS

Jerome Kaplan

IT WAS only a short while ago that camp life was almost

an exclusive venture for the young. Today, there is a
growing acceptance of its values for people of all ages.
Group life on ‘an organized basis in the out-of-doors, 0p-
erating within the tenets of a functional democracy, has
a unique and important contribution to offer to the art
of social living.

The necessary ingredients of group life are missing
most of the year for those who are both lonely and alone.
Loneliness—-aloneness are devastating to inner security
and arc an even more poignant experience in later years.
With the number of people who are over sixty-five in-
creasing significantly each year, the importance of group
life in the out-of—doors as a means of providing satisfy-
ing relationships among older adults cannot be overesti-
mated. The senior adult should have the opportunity to
socialize and take his place, secure within his own age
group. Further, he should have the opportunity to par-
ticipate in all types of activities with people of all ages.

Among the objectives of educational, recreational and
social programs are those providing opportunities for:
:ompanionship and fun; sense of belonging—to the group
and to the community at large, thereby receiving recogni-
tion and regaining or retaining status; the deve10ping of
new interests and skills and the retaining or renewing of
old ones; arousing interest in order to stimulate the de-
sire to learn, for the ability to learn exists at any age;
furthering the ability to adjust in a changing environ-
ment. All are related to a healthy philosophy of living,
and are the very same goals we set for pe0ple of all ages,
but to the older adult they assume greater importance as
[hc opportunities for social communication diminish.

Types of Golden Age Camping

The past several years have seen a rapid expansion in
golden-age camp facilities. Resident camps have begun to
re-cxamine their policies" The potential offered by day
camps has been explored by several communities, such as
Oakland, California, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Minne-

apolis, Minnesota.

Camping periods, too, have been experimented with and
held at various times. Camp Sidney Cohen in Wisconsin,
has held weekend camping during the winter, spring and
fall seasons. Camps operating out of Cleveland and New
York have been holding special sessions after the regular
summer camp season terminates. Council Camp in llli-
nois, serving the older Jewish residents of Chicago, has
for:the past four years sponsored an annual “pre-season”
camping period for two weeks. Other camp's like the Fresh
Air Camp in Minneapolis, and the camp sponsored by the
E. D. Farmer Foundation in Dallas, Texas, have held
special camping periods for senior adults in the “heat”, of
the summer camping season. There have been periods for
older people only, as well as for mixed age groups. Fam-
ily camps have also catered to the old as well as the young.
Even so, golden-age groups are a new phenomenon on thc I
American camping scene.

Although older adult camping is beginning to take many
forms, there is a common denominator——success. The
twenty-four-hour group living situation of the resident
camp and the eight-hour day camp afford a special oppor-
tunity to build positive,social relationships and creative-
ness.

Again, the camp environment offers the beauty of na-
ture which has escaped the urban dweller for too many
years. And yet, in many instances, camp program content
is still geared to the same type of activities as are offered
the urban program.

I

Program Content

0n the surface it appears that it is the older person him-
self who prefers the social and craft program of the city,
in a camp setting. Perhaps the major reason why camps
to date have concentrated on this type of activity is be-
cause of the relative newness of camping for older adults.
Latent, but still too potent, is the fear of the frailty of the
aged. After a season of camping which includes pleasant
surprises in regard to the physical capacity and mental
agility of the campers, the initial concept built around
“frailty” is modified. The new precept assumes that the
wishes and interests of all older pe0ple vary depending
upon the general age range, their backgrounds of experi-

175

ence and education as well as upon their physical and men-
tal ability. Even the aged who are considered especially
handicapped have not only learned how to live with their
debilities but have received medical examinations prior to
being accepted as campers. As in camps for youngsters,
medical attention should be available at all times. While
this aspect has been respected by golden-age camps, orien-
tation to camp life has.not kept pace with the elaborate
preparations associated with camping for the young. In-
terpretation to the community and family has rarely in-
cluded the possibility of death “from natural causes”
which has a high probability in an age group in which
most deaths do occur.

Emphasis on nature is unique to a camp experience.
Each succeeding senior-age camp year has shown a de-
cided trend toward utilizing the out-of-doors in more of
the activities. The outdoor nature program has been mod-
ified to a great extent, for this group, but has not been
eliminated. Increasingly, activities such as fishing,“ boat-

ing, wading and swimming, nature strolls, have become a
part of it.

\Velf are Campers Only?

To date, the lower economic groups make up the great-
est proportion of present day senior-age campers. This is
probably so since the vast majority of the facilities which
offer such camping opportunities usually cater to the more
economically, and in some instances, the more emotionally
deprived. The Salvation Army and Volunteers of America
camps are examples. Their leadership in opening camp-
ing to people of all ages, regardless of their ability to pay,
is recognized. A further illustration is the Cleveland camp
which is a cooperative venture between the city and the
Welfare Federation.

Because of these types of organizational structures
through which most communities now operate camping for
older people, such camping in the very immediate future
most likely will continue primarily for those with excep-
tionally limited resources. Too, ,these people are more
easily located. And yet, existing experiences—from Maine
to California, Washington to Florida—demonstrate that
there are many older adults with adequate finances who
eagerly look forward to taking part in camping activities.
Family camping at Norway Point Camp in Minnesota has
included older adults who were willing and able to pay
their own way. Part of the reason is that golden-age clubs
have formed the nucleus and major recruiting source for
camps. These cluhs are very often community groups with
the members having varied ranges of economic resources.
Again, a further answer may be that some of these older
people have been educated to the values of camp life
through the experiences related to them by their children
or grandchildren. Council Camp of Minnesota operated a
golden-age camp for several years which included the
wealthy, the welfare, and those “in between.” Camp
Hawthorne, operating out of St. Louis, has been providing
camping for all ages of men—together. This would indi-
cate that what is necessary is a broad scale educational
program to invite middle aged adults to take part in the

176

camp environment, and to make camp settings as attrac-
tive as resorts for those who are fairly well off financially.
Certainly, the more financially independent are all too
often overlooked in community recreation planning. It is
true that they may have the money or status to belong to
private clubs or other organizations, but it cannot be as-
sumed that this will wholly meet their needs. Neither
should the recipient of old age assistance be segregated
from the community at large. All pe0ple, in the same cul-
tural milieu, regardless of economic status, have the same
social needs, varying in degree according to individual
circumstance. If older adult camper response is considered
valid criteria, then the camp is in an advantageous posi-
tion in which to serve the financially independent as well
as the dependent.

Camp Recruitment

Up to now the most effective single method of camper
recruitment has been to invite golden-age clubs to attend
as a body. There have been conflicting Opinions on the
advisability of participation by residents of homes for the
aged and other types of congregate living arrangements.
Where residents of such homes are excluded, it has beer

place of residence. Other sources illustrative of the wide
recruitment potential available, which have been utilizec
in varying degrees by existing golden-age camps, are hos
pitals, boarding homes, nursing or rest homes, public anc
private social welfare agencies, churches and synagogues
physicians and public health nurses.

A_concomitant of recruitment is the type of policy en
visaged by each reSpective camp. Most camp publicity has
been geared toward sessions for senior adults only. Cer
tainly this type of camp session has proved its worth. It is
here, with their peers, that many older adults attain anc
retain a feeling of usefulness. Yet, there is no reason t<
limit camping periods to older adults only. The stimulu:
of youthful exuberance points toward increased group liv
ing in the out-of-doors by groups of all ages. From n1]
observation at several camps, I am impressed with the pos
sihilities of mixing age groups as a stimulator for th:
groups involved, although special activities for the sepa
rate age categories would still predominate.

Golden-age camping is in its maturing stage. The de
velopments in resident camping are signs of the presen
pointing toward hoth expansion of camp availability ant
refinement of the techniques to meet the goals of senio
adult camping. Too, the development of the older adul
day camp has opened a vast resource to this group. Again
as industrial and union recreation for veteran and retire:
workers expands, the camp will gain even further promi
nence and importance. Indeed, the camp is of major im
portance to those older people, and the time is not to:
long distant when there will be camps catering exclusivelj
to older adults.

DRILL FORMATIONS

 

 

B ICYCLE FORMATIONS, military drills,
maneuvers or drill teams—which-
ever you chose to call them—have
evoked enthusiasm and delight wher-
ever they have been-put on by groups
of riders.

This type of bicycle riding involves
the epitome in teamwork because each
rider must be trained to skillfully man-
ipulate his bicycle. It takes consider-
able practice to get a group of varying
riders to work in unison.

Riding in formation precludes touch-
ing the preceding rider’s bike. It takes
concentration and practice to master
such formations, but the participant
will find it fun and rewarding. Leader-
ship is an important factor in putting
these drill formations across.

As it unravels it becomes a color-
ful, exciting and eye filling bicyclc
spectacle for the spectator. It is pos-
sible to perform these drills in your
local school yard to the great cnter-
taimnent of fellow students and fac-
ulty.

1f accompanied by the school band
playing fast tempo martial music, the
movement of the riders in the drill
formations will be enlivened consider-
ably. This has been accomplished with
great reward at bicycle field days put
on for the benefit of the entire com-
munity.

bicycle field days, the maneuvers have
been supplemented by historical bike
displays (using old-time wheels) ; dec-
orated bicycles with costumed riders;
acrobatic bike comedy acts, perhaps
climaxed with the presentation of a
comedy jet bike as the Bike of To-
morrow! A band can provide old-time
melodies for the historical sequences
and music for the maneuvers.

A performance similar to that de-
scribed above was given at a success-
ful bike rodco at the Hollywood Bowl
in California where Harry ,1. Hook, 3
member of the League of American
Wheehnen, put a group of riders
through drill formations.

Mr. Hook, who trained his team of
riders in the interest of cycling as a
whole, planned several maneuvers, in-
volving the Figure “V,” the Pinwheel
and the Figure “8.” The drills were
performed on a stage of 128 feet front-
age by 115 feet drop, providing ample
space for the performance.

The diagrams that accompany this
section are practically self-explana-
tory. We have described them fully in
the text.

Figure “8”

As many riders as possible should
get into this formation. The leader,
shown in the chart by the arrow with
the tail, starts and rides from the top
in an “S” direction. When he and the
following riders reach the bottom they
cross the center of the “S,” care of
course being taken by the riders go-

ing up so that they cross between tm
riders.

It takes a little careful calculatio:
to prevent a collision, but if the ride
crossing the line follows closely afte
the one bicycle that’s already past, 11:
has ample time to cross before t1]:
other one coming down will get int:
the “S” formation. Just follow the ar
row on the diagram which indicate:
the formation. The more riders ther:
are in this formation, the better it wil
look to the audience, and it’s some

thing that will always “bring dowr
the house.”

RECREATIO)

Figure “V”

This is a very effective formation.
In the diagram follow the one set of
arrows which lead to making one side
of the “V.” To make the other side
thc riders follow the plain curved lines.

To start, two groups of riders enter
from each side of the stage or field.
Note the arrow with the tail; this is
the first rider on one side entering
‘he circular maze.

As soon as this rider has crossed
the line, the leader of the other col-
umn also crosses into the t0p circle.
After the first rider crosses ‘into the
second circle, the leader of the second
column then crosses the line into the
second circle.

When the leader of the first column
entch into the third circle, leader of

 

FIGURE “V” FORMATION

the second column also crosses the
line into the third circle, and so on,
all down the line; here the leader~ of
the first column turns to the right and
continues up (in the diagram), then
slowly turns to left and comes down
larrows on dotted line) to a point
determined by the size of the “V.”

The leader of the second column, ,

following the lines without arrows, does
the samc on the right hand side of the
diagram, following down and meeting
the-leader of the first column at the
bottom of the “V,” which of course
should be facing the audience.

Thc other riders in the columns fol-
low their respective leaders and as
soon as they get in position all dis-

mount and stand at attention along-
side their bikes.

.Jan 1953

A patriotic touch may be added by
having two or four riders near the top
position, carrying flags, ride slowly
straight down and takc a position at
the bottom of the “V.” This is shown
in the diagram by a small oblong. As
the band plays the “Star Spangled
Banner” they salute the fiags carried
on the bicycles by the color bearers.
the
course, there should be some marking
on the ground for the riders to follow.

Beforc formation starts, of

The Pinwheel

This maneuver is formed by two
groups of riders forming circles, one
inside the other and going in opposite
directions. Riders for the inner circle
enter first and start their circular mo-
tion; then from the other side of the
stage the riders for the outer circle
start forming their circle, as indicated
by the arrows on the diagram. . . . Of
course more riders are needed for the
outer circle than for the inner one.
Riders should keep fairly close to-
gether, but not close enough to cause
their wheels to touch.

In breaking up, the leader in the
outer circle lcads off first to the left,
while the inner circle continues in mo-
tion until the last rider in the outer
circle goes by, when the leader of the
inner circle rides to right off stage,
followed by all riders in the inner
circle. Three or more circles may be

used depending upon the number of
riders available.

Mystery Race

Here’s a new bikc race that’s lots of
fun because the ridcrs don’t know ex-

actly what’s eXpected of them until
they are ready to ride the last lap. It
is usually held on a circular track or
in a playground.

Here’s the idea: place slips of paper
numbered 3 to 10 in a hat. The race
gets underway and, meanwhile, the
referee takes a slip from hat to see
how many laps the race will be.

The referee, however, does not in-
dicate to the riders how many laps
will be run until the participants are
about to start the last lap. It’s this
element of mystery that creatcs the
fun, because the riders do not know
whether to ride fast for the short race,
or to conserve energy for the longer
race.

Slow or Snail Race

This is one of the most sensational-
ly funny races ever held on bicycles.
It is a simple race in which everyone
has an equal chance. Every type of
bicycle can be used—and it is for boys
or girls, tall or short, fat or slim.

The object of the race is to see
which rider can travel slowest. The
last rider to cross the finish line is
the winner—if he has not violated any
of the rules.

A course 50 to 100 feet long is laid
out, with several lanes 3 to 6 feet wide.
Lanes may be made by stretching
strings or chalk. A rider is disquali-
fied if he deviates from his lane,
touches foot to the ground or turns
around.

At a signal, each rider gets under-
way at the starting point, riding as
slowly as possible. It’s 'quite a trick to
ride slowly without violating one of
the rules above. But the race will
prove exciting to riders and spectators
alike. Be sure you have a referee to
decide who has violated the rules.

Mixed Distance Race

Each rider in turn, as a member of
a team, rides a different number of
laps. It is most interesting when you
mix the laps up, with shorter distances
coming at either end or as sprint laps.

As the contestant reaches the next
member of 'his team, he passes a baton
to him or touches his hand. This could
be done in a specially designated touch
area to a moving rider.

Youth Assembly

“The World We Want” will be discussed at the United
States Assembly of Youth to be held September 3-8 at the
University of Michigan. The Young Adult Council of the
National Social Welfare Assembly, which is the sponsor of
the youth assembly and the instrument of cooperation of
sixteen national organizations serving the eighteen-to-thirty
age group in the United States, hopes the discussions will
inspire more young adults to contribute toward the “world
we want” by assuming their responsibilities in the commu-
nity, the nation, and the world.

Young men and women from all parts of the United
States, and some guests from abroad, will share in the dis-
cussions and in the folk dancing, singing, sports and other
cultural-recreational activities. Further information about

the assembly may be obtained by writing to Ernest M.

Howell, Young Adult Council, 134 East 56th Street, New
York 22.

RECREATIOE

First Meeting

Planned and executed by a committee appointed by the
nternational Northwest Parks Association, the first meet-
1g of the Northwest Parks and Recreation Training Insti-
ite was hcld in Vancouver, April twenty-third. Attend-
ncc represented twelve city, county and state agencics
rom Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. The meet-
ng was so successful that a resolution was adopted recom-
1ending that the institute be continued on an annual basis.

In-Service Training

“Understanding the Adolescent” was the theme of an
n-service training series of four institutes, one each week
rom April 22 to May 13, presented by the Milwaukee De-
:artlnent of Municipal Recreation to all of the fulltime
ccreation instructors and social cehter directors. The
media used in presenting the material were talks by au-
horities on adolescent deve10pment, discussions, and films.

Frederic A. Delano

In the passing of Mr. Delano, uncle of the late President
{oosevelt, and a government ofiicial under four presidents,
he recreation movement lost a loyal supporter. A pioneer
n the field of city planning, Mr. Delano played an influ-
ntial part in the early development of plans for Chicago
nd the New York region. Among the many significant
ervices he rendered was his chairmanship of the National
{csources Planning Board from its creation, in 1934, to

943.

In the early 1920’s Mr. Delano worked for the establish-
ient by Congress of the National Capital Park and Plan-
ing Commission and he served as its chairman from 1924
o 1942. Under his leadership the commission acquired
housands of acres of park and playground areas in the
)istrict of Columbia and initiated studies which resulted in
stablishment of the District Recreation Department.

For many years Mr. Delano contributed to the financial
upport of the National Recreation Association. He also
erved as sponsor for the Association in his home city of
iewburgh, New York, which was given two splendid rec-
eation pr0perties by members of the Delano family. Few
ndividuals have rendered a more varied and useful ser-
rice in the interest of a better America.

The simple family picnic or outing
lay require no more organization
ran the merc delegation of responsi-
ilities to family members. However,
1e secret of the success of larger pic-
ics and outings depends on how care-
Jlly they are planned and organized,
nd how skillfully they are directed.

Ordinarily, work must be divided
mong committees, each having defi-
ite duties assigned to it. These com-
rrittees should be carefully chosen to
eprcsent groups and different parts of
he community and should be of both
exes and of various ages. They. are
mportant if the picnic is to be a com-
nunity enterprise.

whue General Committee—A carefully
hosen general committee should first
he appointed, the number and type of
rcoplc comprising such a group de-
tending upon the outing being held.
ts responsibilities should be general
planning and supervision, the general
Ichecking up” needed on details.

"he Grounds Committee—Duties in-
:lude locating and securing the use of
he picnic site, its care during the day,
Ind seeing that the grounds are left
n a clean and good condition; deci-
=ion upon the location for the picnic,
aking into consideration: shelter and
511adc, fireplaces, tables, seating pro-
risions, charges for the use of the
area, drinking water, toilet facilities,
.vaste baskets, sanitary conditions.

Bathing facilities are often desir-
able, but not absolutely necessary. If
swimming facilities are available and
lifeguards are not provided, some ar-

rangement must be made to have them
in attendance.

races, and other such activities.
Transportation Committee——-This is
responsible for getting people, equip-
ment and supplies to and from the
picnic ground. Time and place of de-
parture to and from the grounds
should be carefully arranged and pub-
licized.

Committee on Promotion and Publi-
city—Duties of this committee should
begin several weeks before the day of
the outing; but do not launch publi-
city so far in advance that people will
forget the date.

Word of mouth, newspaper articles,
circular letters, post cards, bulletins,
stickers, posters, radio, telephone calls,
announcements at meetings and gath-
ering places, and interviews are all
important channels. A striking name
for the picnic always has its appeal.

In rural and small communities it

is a common practice to send out to
adjoining towns and cities, a day or
two before the picnic, a good-will car-
avan of automobiles, the community
band, and other boosters.
Program Committee—The success of
a picnic or outing is no longer deter-
mined solely by the quantity and qual-
ity of “good eats.” “Fun for all ages”
is essential to the successful outing.
Let everyone have an opportunity to
take part in some manner. Some
people prefer mental games or skilled
activities, some like community sing-
ing and musical activities, and others
prefer the dramatic side of the pro-
gram. If your activities are built
around the “seven urges”—social,
rhythmic, dramatic, linguistic, musi-
cal, constructive, physical—you are
sure to have something to please ev-
erybody.

Upon the program committee falls
the responsibility of seeing that the
program starts on time, is kept moving.

gram.

It is the duty of the committee to
arrange for the presence of starters,
record keepers, announcers, and oth-
ers who may be needed to carry out
the activities program. Badges or rib-
bons for the officials and assistants
will facilitate the handling of a crowd.
The program should be of such a na-
ture that it can meet sudden changes
and emergencies. Arrangements should
be made for an indoor activities pro-

gram in case of rain or unfavorable
weather conditions.

Fellowship or Hospitality Committee
——This committee has the important
job of making everyone feel at home,
greeting pe0ple as they arrive at the
picnic ground. This 'is the group
which makes arrangements for infor-
mation and checking booths where
picnickers can find information, or
leave baskets, parcels, musical instru-
ments, clothing, and other things for
safe-keeping.

Finance Committee—The method of
financing picnics and outings varies.
In some instances, expenses are paid
out of the general fund of the organ-
ization Sponsoring the affair. When

186

it is held under the auspices of several
organizations, each group shares in
the expenses. A number of other meth-
ods include donations from individu-
als, contributions from towns or com-
munities participating, proceeds from
baseball games, entertainments, and
concessions. In every case finances

should be centralized.

Committee on Refreshments—Respon-
sibilities will vary according to the
size, the place, and the nature of the
picnic group. This committee will de-
cide upon the kind of refreshments,
and when and how they are to be

 

served. Publicity should be given to
the arrangements decided upon. This
committee makes sure that all neces-
sary utensils and equipment, such as
tubs, ladles, plates, cups, soda straws,
ice cream spoons, and other needed
supplies are on hand and ready for
use. Many of these supplies may be
obtained in wholesale quantities
through local manufacturers and deal-
ers.

There are, of course, picnics to
which it is preferable for picnickers to
prepare and bring their own food. In
such instances arrangements are often
made for ice cream, coffee, or other
beverages to be sold or given away at
the scene of the outing; and some-
times food is sold on the picnic
grounds.

“Let’s Have a Picnic”

Those of us who study recreation
trends in order to include our needs
in annual budgets, noted a great in-
crease of interest in the old fashioned
family picnic this last summer. It
seemed to start about Mother’s Day,
when mother and her brood spread
their picnic gear in a park and had
fun. It was easier than littering up
the house for mother to clean up. Or
easier than asking her to cook and

prepare for her own celebration. At

any rate our parks were packed an:
jammed with family picnic group
and it didn’t let up all summer. AI
tendance figures doubled, and all fa

cilities became crowded.

Along with this increase in picni
attendance have come certain needs i;
maintenance and supervision. To mee
these, we in the Los Angeles Count

{ecreation -- Recruitment

EECRUITMENT or PERSONNEL in the
recreation profession concerns
.elf with all the factors which influ-
cc the decision of individuals to
ek work in this field. The sub-com-
fttce distinguishes between the area
recruitment and the area of selec-
H1 only when “selection” is con-
rued to include, (I) the process of
6 scientific determination of qualifi-
tion and adaptability for admittance
professional curricula, and (2) the
‘ocess of the employment of indi-
duals for work responsibility.
An analysis of the factors involved
the recruitment process points up
we pertinent questions, as follows:

1Why is recruiting for recreation
wound a problem? Comparatively
cent changes in our concept of rec-
ation and its place in the social
ene has created a need for a new
ad of lcadership. We not only need
define our leadership requirements
it to discover factors in effective re-
uitment. The “inspired leadership”
at we are recruiting finds ready ac-
uss to many other kinds of positions
hich are more lucrative. ‘
There arc inherent disadvantages in
any recreation positions which must

eckends and holidays, and unusually
3avy demands at some seasons, makc

aries, account for a large turnover of
professional personnel.

Lack of public understanding of the
role of recreation in community life
oftentimes creates a work environment
which counteracts permanent satisfac-
tion with the profession.

2. For what are we recruiting? What
are the kinds of jobs that we need to
hll? As we recruit for (a) positions
that must be filled immediately and
(b) for the profession generally, from
a long range point of view, some rec-
onciliations may be eXpected in the
interim period, especially as they ap-
ply to professional preparation.

There is need for better understand-
ing of jobs available in this field.
Clearly defined jobs and written de-
scriptions are essential for all posi-
tions. These must include clear state-
ments of type of work, major duties,
requirements of work and necessary
preparation, not only for executives
and all full-time personnel, but also
for part-time and seasonal employees,
and for volunteers. Recruitment of
those already employed, for better po-

sitions, needs Special consideration.

3. For what kind of people are we
looking? Standards and qualifications
for all types of recreation personnel
are an essential. Study and analysis
must be made of skills, competencies
and abilities that the prospective rec-
reation worker must possess. We must
know what we want, and be able to
recognize a prospect when we find
one.

4-. What is now being done in recruit-
ment of personnel for the recreation
profession? This committee wishes to
assemble as complete a report as pos-

 

Verna Rensvold

sible of the present recruitment situa-
tion. The National Recreation Associ-
ation for years has had the recruit-
ment of professional personnel as one
of its important functions. Its bro-
chure, Recreation—A New Profession
in a Changing World, has had wide
distribution and use in career confer-
ences and vocational guidance clinics.
There are extensive programs of re-
cruitment in private agencies, colleges
and universities, and local public de-
partments. Leadership training insti-
tutes, guidance, junior leader pro-
grams, apprenticeships and internships
constitute some of the recruitment de-
vices currently in use. The committee
solicits information from all sources
as to effective methods and devices
that can be included in this report.

5. What are the sources of potential
recreation personnel? Colleges con-
tinue to train both generalists and
specialists for career positions in rec-
reation. All sourccs will he surveyed,
including high schools, vocational
schools, colleges and universities, al-
lied fields, drOp-in applicants and
other professions.

6. Whose job is it to recruit recrea-
tion personnel? This is a partnership
enterprise of all membérs of the rec-
reation profession, recreation educa-
tors, practitioners and laymen. It is
also a job of high school and college
guidance programs and of personnel
departments of governmental and pri-
vate agencies. The committee will un-
dertake to explore and recommend

methods of coordination and follow-
up.

7. What do we need to help us in the
recruitment job? Plans are underway
for a variety of aids which will in-
clude recruiting leaflets for use by
high school counsellors, sample job
descriptions and standards, exhibits,
displays, slides, sample speeches for
use with various groups, suitable pro-
motion material for personnel depart-
ments, sanlple publicity and commu-
nications media including T-V and
radio, and articles for various kinds
of magazines including those read by
parents and youth. Promotion of
scholarships, apprenticeships and in-
ternships, assistance with career con-
ferences, textbook material, visitations
to recreation departments by high
school and college students, and
speeches at conferences of many kinds
of associations are suggested. The
possibility of producing a film for re-
cruiting will be explored.

The sub-committee on recruitment
dedicates itself to an attempt to get
answers to these questions and others
that subsequently may arise. In so do-
ing, we solicit and urge all members
of the profession to participate in this
project by sending suggestions and ex-
periences that will make the work of

the committee more meaningful and
effective.

Canada: Leaders Unlimited

They have come from the north,
east, and west—these recreation en-
thusiasts! These are people who feel
that recreation will help Canadians
build a better country, that it will add
to the social and physical development
of its citizens! The National Council
on Physical Fitness saw this need a
few years ago. The idea grew and be-
came a reality last fall, when the Uni-
versity of British Columbia opened its
gates to twenty-nine Canadians for a
one-year diploma-course in public rec-
reation (“On the Campus,” Novem-
ber, 1952). Scholarships were con-
tributed by the National Council.

Director Barry Lowes of Toronto
and seventeen instructors have han-
dled the numerous courses: commu-
nity recreation organization and ad-
ministration, agricultural group work,
professional writing, public relations,
psychology and the usual crafts,

games. Practical experience has also
played an active role, the students con-

Unfortunately, there have been few
[tempts by the commercial stations to
sc TV as an aid to instruction. Pro-
rams that recreation leaders could use
ave been telecast mostly on local net-
'orks. In the metropolitan New York
tea, for instance, the “Knot-Hole

)odger home games, on WOR-TV,
hannel 9. Members of the team com-

how, “Draw with Me,” permits- the
riewers in the recreation center to use

0 follow up his suggestions with the
group. The “Ding Dong Schoo,” a
WNBT daily morning program for the
)re-school child, offers arts and crafts
1nd games, and its fine program mate-

:erial has received the plaudits of many
Bducators.

Television can aid the recreation
program. Its use offers many oppor-
lunities. The staff specialist in gym-
nastics and the major sports, as well
as in arts and crafts, can appear be-

fore the camera to give instruction.
The program can be followed by activ-
ity and participation on the part of
viewers at the center.

City and state educational systems
are now applying for the use of the
recently authorized educational chan-
nels, and television will play an in-
creasingly important role in education.
Recreation leaders can lead in the pro-
gramming activities of these newer sta-
tions and develop materials that will
supplement the recreation program.
They should, whenever possible, use
the programs now being offered to gain

Adventures in Artificial
Respiration

Peter V. Karpovich, M.D. Associ-
tion Press, New York 7. Pp. 294.
7.50.

The author of this book, who is
rofessor of physiology at Springfield
ollcge, has taken partoin the investi-
ution of all possibilities for a method
f artificial respiration which would
c superior to the prone-pressure
lethod of long-standing. Dr. Karpo-
ich maintains, however, that there is
0 single method which will fit all
Incrgency conditions. He feels that
=chniques should be adapted to indi-
idual conditions. His book, pre-
arcd with financial assistance from
1c army, is planned to provide infor-
iation which can be used in teaching
rtilicial respiration, and in research,
nd it presents the scientific basis for
electing “the best method.” It in-
ludes tables for identification and
lassification of 117 known methods,
nd carries an interesting history of
he art of resuscitation. Its many il-

Jstrations add interest and clarifica-

Primer of Drawing for Adults

Howard Simon. Sterling Publish-
ng Company, New York 10. Pp. 137.
€5.00.

This is one of the best books we
lave seen on this subject. The well-
.nown author-artist reveals a new
asier-to-learn drawing technique
vhich he has been teaching to ama-
eur beginners for several years at
'lcw York University. By using this
echnique, many old copybook rules
on he ignored and the time required
or learning shortened. Simon calls
his method that of drawing by “lin-
-ar edge” and “articulate movement.”
‘le avoids completely the so-called
tommercial arts and leads his reader
lirectly toward individual expression.

The book is illustrated with the au-
hor’s own work and diagrammatic ex-
planations, and with many additional

The Lost and the Found

Robert Collis. Woman’s Press, 425
Fourth Avenue, New York 16. Pp.
181. $3.50.

Absorbing reading for parents, so-
cial workers and leaders of children’s
groups! Much can be learned from
this tender and deeply moving true
story of two children who survive in-
credible hardships . . . and of the
man who helped them back to a nor-
mal world. Dr. Margaret Mead, in
her introduction, says truly, “This is
not a book about horror but a book
about strength and trust. It is not a
book about trauma but a book about
blessing. It is no cool, objective case
history, but a warm, vivid, narrative.”

The two youngsters, Eva and Laszlé,
survived the horrors of a concentra-
tion camp, the death of their parents,
and long illness, and are now leading
a happy, normal life in Ireland. It is
interesting to note how recreation,
and camping, played an important
part in their rehabilitation.

A condensed version of this story
has appeared in the Woman’s Home
Companion.

Best Sports Stories, 1953 Edition

Edited by Irving T. Marsh and Ed-
ward Ehre. E. P. Dutton and Com-
pany, Incorporated, New York 10.

Pp. 344. $3.50.

This, the ninth annual collection of
the best sports writing, presents a pan-
orama of the 1952 sports year. Writ-
ten by top-flight reporters, the best
newspaper and magazine articles deal
with exciting events that show a cross-
section of the year’s outstanding ath-
letics. The stories range from a de-
tailed account of the third game in
the 1952 World Series to the hilari-
ous tale of the man from Yale who
never played football but was sent in

to catch a forward pass to make the
final score Yale—41, Harvard—14,
and to the story of how Jack Westland
won the National Amateur Golf title.
(President Eisenhower would like this
one.) The best news story award
goes to Jesse Abramson of the New
York Herald Tribune for his account
of the Sugar Ray Robinson-Joey Max-
im fight. Twenty-three of the year’s
best sports pictures are included.

Elementary Lessons in Gardening

Paul R. Young. The National Car-
den Institute, Columbus, Ohio. 1953.
Pp. 106. $1.00.

During the depression, and during
the war years, gardening flourished
as an activity promoted and sponsored
by recreation departments and boards
of education. It’s a wonderful activ-
ity. Let’s bring it back!

This book will give you the know-
how. It has full information on the
organization of such! projects, garden
fundamentals worked out as projects,
plus a number of short-term projects
including Christmas table decorations,
window boxes, and care of house
plants. Illustrated by “how-to-do”
photographs and line drawings.

Nature leaders, too, will find use-
ful information and projects.—Vir-
ginia Musselman, Program Service,

Woodsmoke—The Book of
Outdoor Lore

Ellsworth Jaeger. The Macmillan
Company, New York 11. Pp. 228. $2.95.

Mr. Jaeger, curator of education at
the Buffalo Museum of Science, is well-
known in the nature and camping field.
His previous books, including Nature
Crafts, Tracks and Trailcraft, Council
Fires, and Wildwood Wisdom, are on
most camping shelves. This one will
be no exception.

As with all of his books, this is full
of clear, interesting sketches of camp-
craft projects and skills. The text con-
tains fascinating information about
trees, animals, Indians, and outdoor
living. Any camp group would pore
over it, and become enthusiastic about
trying out his suggestions.

This quarter of the year has many days which should inspire recreation leaders to plan pro-
grams that are different-and interesting. Numerous birthdays—of famous patriots and favorite
authors and poets—and important dates in American history should provide ample material
around which many hours of interesting activity for story hour, dramatic, and hobby groups
could be planned. independence Day and Joseph Lee Day are occasions for good community-
wide programs for all ages. National Dog Week suggests pet shows and exhibits—and for the
more musically inclined, an all-Gershwin concert. A calendar can be a program planner’s

aide-de-camp. is it yours?

COLD, BATTLE-WEARY, the Marines
were re-deploying toward Hungnam. A rifle com-
pany was guarding a mountain pass vital to the
withdrawal of two regiments. The company beeame
surrounded. If help didn’t come, 6,000 men were
lost.

Into this situation, Lieutenant Colonel Davis
boldly led his Marine battalion. Over eight miles
of heavily defended icy trail they attacked, and
across three ridges deep in snow.

They fought three days and nights.

But finally Colonel Davis reached and freed the
company. He opened the pass and held it till the
two regiments got by. Then, tighting through the
last of the enemy and carrying his wounded with
him, he led his own gallant battalion into safety.

“Korea and World War II have taught me,” says
Colonel Davis, “that courage is common to all arm-
ies; it’s the better equipped side that has the edge.
You’re giving our men that edge every time you in-
vest in a Defense Bond. For Bonds, which are per-
sonal savings for you, are also muscle for America’s
economy. Heiping produce better equipment to pro-
tect the hrave men who are protecting us all.”

Peace is for the strong! For peace and prosperity
save with U. S. Defense Bonds!

Now E Bonds pay 3%! Now, improved Series E Bonds
start paying interest after 6 months. And average 3%
intercst, eompounded semiannually when held to ma-
turity! Also, all maturing E Bonds automatically go on
earning—at the new rate—for 10 more years. Today,
start investing in U.S. Series E Defense Bonds through
the Payroll Savings Plan at work.
