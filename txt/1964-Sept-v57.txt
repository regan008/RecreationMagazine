On the Cover

What’s new under the Florida sun?
The impending 46th National Rec-
reation Congress in Miami Beach,
October 4-9, the first Congress to
be held in Florida. Congress head-
quarters Will be the famed Deau-
ville-Carillon Hotels on the ocean-
front. As our cover proves, you
can’t help but have fun in the sun
in Miami Beach, that incredible
resort stretched between the Atlan-
tic Ocean and Indian Creek. Is this
any way to run 3 Congress? You

bet it is! ( See also Pages 337-339.)

Next Month

As we celebrate United Nations
Week, October 18-24, we will take a
look at park developments at home
and abroad. A look at Northern
Europe parks proves that “A Park
Is for People,” as Dr. Elliott Ave-
don discovered during a recent trip
abroad. We will also salute world-
iamous Stanley Park in Vancouver
as it celebrates its seventy-fifth an-
niversary. We will examine New
Jersey’s crash program for park-
land acquisition resulting from its
$60,000,000 Green Acres bond
issue approved in 1961.

William F rederickson, Jr., gen-
eral manager of the Los Angeles
City Department of Recreation and
Parks, will present his department’s
“Blueprint for Organization: A
New Look at Operation Tech-
niques,” which resulted from an
industrial engineering study of the
department’s operation. The study
covered two broad areas: the ap-
plication of modern industrial en-
gineering and costing techniques to
construction, maintenance, and re-
lated operations of the parks
branch; and a detailed examination
into the entire administrative setup.

Another international article,
“Making Headlines” by 1 ac A.
Cropley, will tell how the energetic
citizens of the atomic energy center
of Deep River, Ontario, developed
their own community newspaper.

LETTERS

Letter from LBJ

Mrs. Ruth O’Neil, chairman of the

Board of Supervisors for Maricopa
County, Arizona, was recently elected
to the Board of Trustees of the National
Recreation Association and received the
following letter of congratulations from
President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Dear Mrs. O’Neil:

May I take this opportunity to extend
my warmest personal congratulations to
you on recently being elected a member
of the Board of Trustees of the National
Recreation Association. I have been
aware of the various honors which have
been bestowed upon you in recent years,
including your appointment as chair-
man of the National Association of
Counties Special Committee on Recrea-
tion, as member of the Citizens’ Com-
mittee for the Outdoor Recreation Re-
sources Review Commission Report, as
the first president of the newly estab-
lished National Association of County
Parks and Recreation Oflicials, and now
your latest accomplishment.

Our country and your state are in-
deed fortunate to have a person of your
vision and leadership in public office.

LYNDON B. JOHNSON, The White

House, Washington.

President Lyndon B. Johnson
White House

Washington, D. C.

Dear President Johnson:

The leisure-time dollar is the largest
dollar volume of any particular indus-
try Or activity in the United States to-
day and will continue to increase. Ap-
palachia has a natural asset of woods,
mountains, and Americana that the
American people and many from other
countries are searching for and eagerly
desiring to spend their dollars to see,
hike through, drive to, ski on, swim in,
and just simply relax in an atmosphere
of solitude and the beauty of nature.

To mention only one of the hundreds
of recreation activities and resorts that
could easily fit into these areas, let me
suggest the sport and facilitv of skiing.
Investors all over the United States are
using bulldozers to push up “mole hills”
to which the eager skier will drive hun-
dreds of miles “just to have fun and
spend his money.” Appalachia has a
type of terrain that is bringing some

328

of the highest prices in real estate to-
day.

Americans are in need of added rec-
reation land, especially the type that
is natural to Appalachia. Send your
recreation planners there with the com-
mercial interests in this field, and you
will find poverty turning into prosperity
in a very short time.

Hoping this may be helpful to you
and to Appalachia.

ELCIN D. LEE, Director of Recreation,
La Porte, Indiana.

RECREATION Magazine has estab-
lished a new bulletin service to editors
of recreation periodicals. The bulletin
is called Pick-Ups and contains items
of current and historical interest as well
as pertinent quotations.

Your new bulletin Pick-Ups shows
promise of being a distinct and unique
NRA service for editors of recreation
periodicals. David Swavely, the editor
of our monthly newsletter for Army
Headquarters, assures me that your new
news sheet will be most helpful to him.
May we suggest that the purpose of
Pick-Ups may easily be broadened to
serve editors of all periodicals in our
field and need not be restricted to state
publications?

Tribute to Helen W. Center

Sirs:

Helen W. Center, aquatics supervisor
for the San Francisco Recreation and
Park Department, was killed recently
in a tragic automobile accident. . . .
Mrs. Center had developed one of the
most outstanding and unique aquatic
programs in the United States. In the
past eight years under her guidance, the
city of San Francisco has constructed
six indoor swimming pools, which rep-
resent an investment of approximately
fifteen million dollars. Besides being
the guiding factor in developing the
above pools, Helen Center was respon-
sible for administering two beach areas,
a lakefront, and three other pools, in-
cluding Fleishhacker Pool which is one
of the largest in the world.

Not only did Mrs. Center develop a
number of worthwhile facilities, but
also she made available to the citizen-
ry a multi-phase aquatics program. In-
cluded in the program were handi-
capped, adults, preschool, and life-
saving classes. Through her initial ef-
forts, San Franciso became famous for
its internationally known synchronized
swimming team, the Merionettes. Hav-
ing gained seven consecutive national
AAU championship titles to their credit,
the Merionettes are probably the only
national championship team in the
United States that represents a recrea-
tion department.

Upon learning of Helen Center’s
death, world - renowned swimming
coach Charles Sava was quoted as say-
ing, “The San Franciso Recreation and
Park Department has suffered a great
loss. Mrs. Helen W. Center was a tire-
less worker for more public pools, and,
because of her efforts, San Franciso’s
school children and adults can enjoy
swimming in well-run pools. She left

us a great legacy.” And indeed she
has!

A' REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

 

Retirement Preparation
THE 1964 lecture and discussion

course on preparation for retire-
ment sponsored by District 65 of the
Retail, Wholesale 8: Department Store
Union, included participants who re-
ceived full wages from their employers
while they learned what retirement has
in store for them. A total of a hundred
union members of all ages enrolled
voluntarily for the series of eight week-
ly sessions at the union’s headquarters
in New York City. Of these, thirty
were employes of department stores,
whose employers agreed to pay them
their normal wages for the two hours
they spent each Wednesday afternoon
learning how to plan for retirement.
The balance of the enrollees were from
non-department store sections of the
union. They attended evening sessions
of the course. Husbands and wives of
members enrolled in the course were
invited to join their spouses at the ses-
sions. Topics covered by the course
included economics, physical and men-
tal health, social and recreation aspects
of retirement. Emphasis was on plan-
ning for retirement to a new and fruit-
ful life, not retirement from work or
active living. The course stressed that
planning before actual retirement
makes chances for a successful retired
life much greater.

The Unseen Killer

CARBON MONOXIDE is more of a threat
to outdoorsmen than is generally
realized. It is a colorless, odorless, al-
most undetectable gas produced any-
where that heating or cooking is being
done with wood, gasoline, or any other
oil products, such as alcohol, fat, or
coal; in fact, with anything that con-
tains carbon. Fatal results can occur
from inhaling even small amounts of
the unsuspected poison day after day.

Colonel Townsend Whelen and Brad-
ford Angier, co-authors of On Your
Own in the Wilderness (Stackpole
Books), point out that tents—normal-
ly viewed as having plenty of ventila-
tion—are potentially dangerous where
carbon monoxide poisoning is con-

to help improve the profession:

1. Evaluate your summer personnel,
urge the outstanding young men and
women to consider majoring in recrea-
tion with the objective of seeking ca-
reers in this rewarding field.

2. Employ students in training.
They’ll give your program zest and
freshness; you’ll give them valuable
know-how and experience.

3. Help your staff to grow through
additional training, writing, conducting
research and assuming added responsi-

bility. A topflight staff refiects credit

on you.

4. Provide your board or hiring au-
thority with copies of the leaflet, Recre-
ation Superintendent Wanted, and the
manual, Personnel Standards in Com-
munity Recreation Leadership.

A Light in the Darkness
THE OLDEST standing light tower in
the United States, located at Sandy
Hook, New Jersey, was dedicated as a
National Historic Landmark in June.
The light, originally called the “New
York Lighthouse,” has served the ship-
ping world with relatively few interrup-
tions since its construction. During the
American Revolution, the Colonials
put it out of operation in March 1776,
so that the British would not benefit
from it. Following the winning of in-
dependence, the light was ceded to the
United States on March 25, 1790. The
original tower of the Sandy Hook Light
still stands. It is octagonal, with mas-
sive masonry walls seven feet thick at
the base. The tower rises eighty-five
feet above the ground and eighty-eight
feet above the water.

9 An Age

of

i Fulfillment

“There is no end to unfinished business . . .

Ralph Lazarus

E ARE ON THE VERGE of a revo-
Wlution in the production of time

by automation. We need to
make only a few fairly conservative as-
sumptions to reach the conclusion that
our economy is going to provide us
with substantial blocks of spare time
in the next fifteen to twenty years. Be
tween 1900 and 1940 technological ad-
vances allowed us to“ reduce the work
week by a third, or from sixty down to
forty hours, while more than tripling
real per capita income. Though we
have slowed the pace of turning pro-
ductivity gains into greater leisure
since 1940, it seems to me we shall soon
have to quicken it again because of the
pressure from scientific research and
development.

If we were able to cut working time
by a third during the first forty years
of this century, it should now take us
fewer decades to repeat the perform-
ance. A third of a working life is more
than fifteen years. It therefore seems
that a reasonable hypothesis on which
to proceed is that by, let us say, 1985,
we should have accumulated at least
a decade of disposable time per person.

Let us skip over the intervening years
now and take a look at life in 1985. I
suggest this, not to belittle the enor-
mous human and social problems that

will confront us, but because I want to
focus your attention on the goal ahead:
the society of fulfillment that I believe
is within the grasp of our children.

 

MR. LAZARUS is president of Federated
Department Stores. This material is
taken from an address before the F am-
ily Service Association of America.

SEPTEMBER, 1964

The first thing to think about is our
attitudes toward nonwork, for by 1985
automation may have forced our na-

tion to turn leisure frOm a luxury into
a virtue. We are automatically repelled
by such an idea. It runs directly count-
er to the work ethic, which was rooted

 

 

   
 
  
 
 

l”:'llnIllllllllllllI""lII;;llllnl'-

muqu

"'wull

in our culture as far back as the third
chapter of Genesis.
Work has been integrated into man’s

 

moral code since the beginning. This
country was built on the Puritan belief
that honest toil was the foundation of
character, the cement of society and the
uphill road to progress. We treat free
time today as a conditional joy. We per-
mit ourselves to relax only as a reward
for hard work or as the recreation need-
ed to put us back into shape for the job.

Because of these attitudes, the pros-
pect of having additional time off in
blocks large enough to add up to a
disposable decade is greeted with a re-
action that is far closer to fright than

EDITORIAL

 

to eagerness. To our guilt about idle-
ness is added a fear akin to that of un-
employment. Unemployment no longer
brings starvation, but is does threaten
that a life built around work could be
robbed of meaning. It is an awesome
prospect that the new leisure might
force us to search for the meaning of
life within ourselves. For this is un-
derdeveloped territory, one whose re-
sources society has hardly encouraged
us to explore.

Those of you who think historically
may feel that I have been painting a
rather distorted picture. To be liber-
ated from the prison of work has been
a consuming desire of man ever since
he learned to write doer his dreams.
Leisure was a passion to the Greeks.
It was neither work nor play but the
opportunity to enjoy the fruits of the
mind, to enlarge vision and under-
standing, to cultivate individualism and
perfect the art of government.

If the skeptics feel inclined to point
out that Greek leisure was built on the
labor of slaves, it can be rejoined that
we now have the opportunity of build-
ing it on the labor of machines. Even
this was foreseen by the Athenians. Lis-
ten carefully to Aristotle as he dreamed
aloud: “If every tool when summoned,
or even of its own accord, could do the
work that befits it . . . if the weaver’s
shuttle were to weave itself, then there
would be no need either of workers by
masters or slaves by lords.”

SKEPTICS will want to melt our wings
if we try to soar anywhere with the
idea that the mass of our people could

335

use any large amount of free time con-
structively. They say our mass culture
is ridiculed by the civilized world. They
point out our flight from leisure into
moonlighting. And they poke fun at
us with such statistical facts as that
there are five times as many Americans
taking ballroom dancing lessons as
there are students in our colleges and
universities. David Riesman summed
up this skepticism eloquently when he
said, “We are a generation, prepared
for Paradise Lost, who do not know
what to do with Paradise Found.”

But this is only one side of the pic-
ture. The Stanford Research Institute
reports that fifty million Americans are
actively participating in amateur art
activities. Of these, thirty-two million
are musicians and fifteen million are
painters, sculptors and sketchers. There
are now more piano players than fisher-
men, as many painters as hunters, twice
as many people who attend concerts as
those who attend major league baseball
games, and more theatergoers than
boaters, skiers, golfers, and skin-divers
combined.

This is a hopeful beginning, but such
enjoyments as mass piano playing are
quite inadequate to consume automa-
tion’s coming production of time. We
have to be thinking of a decade of dis-
posable time by 1985 or a decade and
a half with thirty years. This is a third
of a working lifetime.

WE DO IVOT KNOW, of course, how
this free time will be divided
among our occupations. The presump-
tion is that common labor will be hit
first and that free time will move up-
ward and sideways through the skills
on an unpredictable and erratic basis.

The cynics say that those who have the
lowest capacity for using free time con-
structively will get the most and that
people like the members of this audience
will actually have to work longer hours,
since the demand for highly educated
talents will far exceed the supply. But
those who are bemused by the decision-
making potential of the computer feel
that some areas of middle management
may face this problem, too.

We may continue to use the old de-
vices of shorter workdays and work-
weeks, holidays, vacations, later school
years, and earlier retirement. But none
of these, for one reason or another,
seems adequate to the task of bailing us
out of the ocean of free time with which
we will be inundated.

Let us concentrate on breaking
through the cast-iron bonds of millen-
nia, of habits, philosophy, and history
that are holding back our imagination.
For the task ahead if literally unpre-
cedented; we shall have to invent the
future.

WE MIGHT TRY to chase the meaning-
lessness out of modern life and
search for a new purpose for man. Even
after we dethrone work, we shall have a
few things left, such as love, beauty,
truth, the endless frontiers of science
and the Sermon on the Mount.

I suspect, though, that most of us find
a new purpose in life most easily
through what we do. And once we shift
our sights as a people, we will find
plenty to do. All around us there are
mountains of unfinished business to
tackle.

How much time and energy would it
take to beautify our central cities and
produce an atmosphere for living that

would bring back the vast middle class?
And what about our slums?

How much time and energy would it
take to transmit the knowledge and tech-
nical skills that would enable the un-
der-developed countries to abolish pov-
erty, disease, and ignorance so that they
can secure for themselves their own
versions of the better life? How much
will it take to bring the neglected hordes
of our own peOple up to the scale of
health, wealth and education that we
call the American way of life?

How many man-years of patient skill
will we need to reverse the tide of school
dropouts for those who are capable of
absorbing further education? What
would happen if we decided to stock-
pile parks, forests, and other recreation
facilities ahead of the time we will ac-
tually need them and ahead of the time
when they will be gone forever?

HERE IS NO END to unfinished bus-
Our education can be ex-
panded in quality, quantity, and vari-
ety way beyond the hopes of our most
visionary pedagogues. That we should
do this is, in fact, the sternest com-
mandment of the coming era of auto-
mation. The speed of change and the
growing complexity of both knowledge
and the world will force us to extend
formal education throughout life in or-
der to keep up with the demands of new
and old occupations, starting with sci-
ence, technology, medicine, and foreign
affairs. And, far more difficult than
that will be the reorientation of educa-
tion in the earlier years from its pri-
mary emphasis on preparation for life
to preparation for living. This is a
revolution that will take a few decades

to work our way through. #

Spectacular indoor assembly hall has sixteen thousand permanent seats

and contains three acres of space with not a single interior column to

obstruct the view of any spectator

was completed last year by the University of Illinois
and has been put to immediate use for large athletic
and cultural events in Champaign-Urbana. It is the king-
size mushroom-shaped $8,350,000 “Illini” assembly hall.
The giant building has attracted worldwide attention for the
record size of its roof unsupported on the inside, for its
more than sixteen thousand-person seating capacity, and
for other “firsts” in design engineering and construction.
Architects for the cavernous edifice were Harrison and
Abramovitz of New York, designers of the United Nations
buildings. General contractors were Felmly-Dickerson Com-
pany of Urbana. Men from almost all the building trades
shared in erecting various parts of the new-type structure.
The new Assembly Hall was financed by bonds guaranteed
by individual student fees. No tax funds were used for the
building’s construction. It has been estimated that the huge
building of unique shape may easily draw a whopping
$2,000,000 a year into the Champaign-Urbana economy——
through outside conventions, and as a family tourist attrac-
tion by itself, just to visit and to marvel at.

S- NEW AND UNIQUE multi-purpose construction marvel

The structure was built in two parts. Its lower half is
a massive “seat” bowl sunk thirty-five feet into the ground
at its center, over which was poured an unusual-shaped re-
inforced concrete “cover” four hundred feet in diameter—
the world’s largest edge-supported dome.

Reprinted with permission from Construction Craftsman,

October 1963.

There are no pillars or trusses inside. The roof itself,
averaging three and a half inches in thickness, obtains tre-
mendous strength from its folded-plate, pleated design—just
as corrugation strengthens cardboard.

Inside the edifice, there are nearly sixteen thousand per-
manent seats, as well as 142 easily reached wheelchair po-
sitions. This capacity can be augmented to 17,500 through
addition of folding chairs on the central performing floor,
or it may be reduced to using forty-two hundred seats in
the theater quadrant alone.

Individual, numbered, fiberglass self-rising seats have
been installed throughout. Those in the theater quadrant
have upholstery and arm rests. Special attention was given
to seating comfort and ample Spacing.' The seats are at-
tached to the bowl’s concrete risers for easy cleaning under-
neath after a program is over.

Locating the central performing floor about thirty feet
below ground level permits the entrances to bring the public
into the assembly hall at points about halfway up the lower
bowl. So it is an easy walk to and from all seats. The highest
seating row is only twenty-two rows above the entrance,
rather than the forty-eight it would have been by standard
design.

Circling the assembly hall under the outer rim of the can-
tilevered seat bowl is a quarter-mile-round upper concourse.
On the inner side it is concrete; on the outer, a glass wall
dramatically angled to contribute to the total “cut-back”
design feature of the building’s profile. Six wide ramps

bring visitors from the outside and lower concourse up onto

this upper concourse.

THE SLOPED, glazed, aluminum-encased windows around

the concourse were specifically designed and installed to
allow for any slight movement of the building in ten differ-
ent directions, varying from a quarter inch to two inches.
Were it not for this arrangement, variations in temperature
on different sides of the building would cause expansions
and contractions that could shatter the quarter-mile of slop-
ing glass that surrounds the concourse.

The heat of the sun on the dome, for example, will force
the dome downward in the direction of the glass. The secret
of the window design that permits their movement under
such pressure is a new kind of extruded welded compression
gasket designed by the building’s architect, Max Abramo-
vitz, a University of Illinois graduate.

For entering the assembly area from the glass-enclosed
concourse, twenty-four “bridges” lead the way to the in-
side. Between them, twenty-four light shafts bring natural
lighting to the lower concourse. It is on the lower concourse
that are located the meeting rooms, ticket facilities, offices,
mechanical rooms, first-aid station, dark room, wire-photo-
center, and press room.

At the performing-floor level under the concourse is the
service level, where have been built the storage spaces, the-
atrical backstage facilities, lockerrooms, dressing rooms,
communications center, television interview room, and
maintenance headquarters. To date, the assembly hall has
already been used as an auditorium, sports arena, theater,
convention hall, and exhibit hall.

As AN AUDITORIUM, the building can utilize any or all
of its full circle of sixteen thousand seats, plus the ad-
ditional fifteen hundred portable chairs set up on the cen-
tral floor. The folding-chair arrangement, used when only
a moderate-sized speaker’s platform is needed, will be used
for student rallies, university commencement exercises, con-
vention session with outstanding speakers, and statewide and
national political campaign addresses and rallies.

To switch the assembly hall to another setup, such as a
theater, a tractor takes out the portable chairs in trailer-
loads of 120 each, and returns with the elements of the de-
mountable stage. This stage can be 48-by-96 feet, or in a
wide variety of 8-by-8-feet modules. It can be used as a sim-
ple platform, or——with addition of theater draperies—it can
be a well-equipped professional stage.

Eighty-five feet above the central floor is the unique thea-

ter grid. When the building is used as a theater, the grid
supports a full array of theatrical draperies—huge masking
draperies at the front and sides for the full height, a travel-
er or opening curtain at the front, sets of borders and legs on
stage, and a backdrop.

These are brought out in trailers and raised high into po-
sition by power winches on the grid. In addition to drap-
eries, the grid handles rigid theatrical scenery and settings.

Movement of the grid and draperies has been set up to
be handled from a single electronic console at the side of
the stage. The technician sets a dial for the direction and'
distance he wants a given set to move. Then, on cue, he flips
a switch that starts the set moving. The system is accurate
to an inch. The full stage has been built to accommodate
road companies of Broadway musicals or dramas, large
opera companies, ballets, symphony orchestras—any type of
event that appears on a stage anywhere in the world.

For programs of serious music, the assembly hall has

‘ready an acoustical shell that provides a sound-reflecting

surface for sides, back, and ceiling of the stage—as well as
a similar surface that juts from the proscenium arch out over
the first rows of seats, like a giant modern canopy.

Eli/hen the draperies, sets, and stage are taken out, the
assembly hall can be set up for basketball or other athletic
events. Some 225 panels of a sectional wooden floor are
put into place for basketball. Stanchions for the backstops
are placed in floor inserts at the north and south ends of
the floor. A large four-sided electric scoreboard is winched
up into position directly under the high grid. If the floor is
being used for traveling arena shows, the basketball equip-
ment is left in the storage room and the show uses the clear
floor area, and adds to it such special facilities as it brought
along itself—such as an ice rink, swimming or diving tanks,
aerial rigging, or rubber floor mats.

Although the assembly hall is located in a population area
of less than a hundred thousand population, its fixed seating
capacity—plus the special areas for paraplegics—give it a
total basic seating capacity exceeding that of nearly all other
multi-purpose buildings in the large cities of the nation—
more fixed seats than at Madison Square Garden in New
York, the Los Angeles Sports Arena, or the Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Auditorium.

As far as the assembly hall’s record four-hundred-foot-
diameter unsupported dome is concerned, among the close
contenders is the Pittsburgh Public Auditorium, which has
an overall exterior diameter of 415 feet, but whose famous
dome alone is only about 340 feet across. #

0 Illinois' flying-saucer assembly hall was _the only edu-
cational structure to receive a merit award this year in the
annual architectural competition sponsored by the Ameri-
can lnstitute of Architects. The sixteen winning designs
were selected from 439 entries. Other winners included the

Carmel Manor retirement community in Carmel Yalley,
California, and the Central Plaza urban redevelopment in

Canton, Ohio.—Ed.

THE AIR FORCE ASSESSES ITS
RECREATION CENTERS

Arthur Todd

G IMMICKS are
not enough.
“Make sure your
basic program is
good before getting
into new gimmicks
and sidelights. Our
programs should
aim for the normal persons, not the
very small percentage of men who cause
trouble. The Air Force is not a rehabil-
itation center. I am all out for quality
programs.” This was a US. Air Force
base commander in Germany speaking
during an interview held in connection
with a study made in 1963 by the Na-
tional Recreation Association of Air
Force recreation centers in Europe. At
this base, as at all others visited, chap-
lains, personnel officers, recreation cen-
ter staff members, base recreation di-
rectors, noncommissioned officers, air-
men, wives, and many others freely ex-

pressed their opinions and ideas about
the center and its programs.

In 1957, the Air Force in Europe
(USAFE) decided that its service clubs
should broaden and expand their pro-
grams. Activities of a hobby and spe-
cial-interest nature for the entire mili-
tary population and their dependents
were to be stressed rather than free
food, coffee, and entertainment for sin-
gle enlisted men. The name was
changed to “recreation center.” The
recreation needs of enlisted men were
to come first but opportunities for ev-
eryone were to be provided as fully as
possible. Seven years later, the Na-
tional Recreation Association was
asked to make an appraisal of the cen-
ter programs to see how far they had
progressed in this direction.

MR. T om), director of the ’Vational Rec-
reation Association Field Service, went
to Europe in 1963 at the request of the

Air Force to conduct the survey report-
ed in. this article.

 

 

312

Since the success of a recreation pro-
gram should be judged according to
how well it satisfied the interests and
desires of the people it is intended to
serve, the members of base cormnuni-
ties were asked to express their opin-
ions about their centers. Nearly four
thousand airmen, officers, and depend-
ents answered such questions as why
do you use your recreation center, why
don’t you use it, what activities should
it offer that it does not now offer, and
what single item would make it more
appealing? The second phase of the
study consisted of visits by the NRA
consultant to thirteen bases in Germany,
France, and England to study the cen-
ter programs and operations. The find-
ings and recommendations were sub-

mitted to Headquarters USAFE on De-
cember 15, 1963.

L IKE other recreation centers any-

where, many Air Force centers lack
enough usable space for a number of
different groups to meet at the same
time. The duplicate-bridge club at the
back of the hall cannot concentrate
while the little-theater group is re-
hearsing on the stage, and the pinochle
players do not like to give up the card
room one night a week for the stamp
club because they want to play every
night!

Partial solutions to the space prob-
lem have been made at some bases by
installing folding partitions, building
additions, and using rooms in school
buildings, youth centers, gyms, and ed-
ucation centers.

The study revealed that considerable
progress had been made in changing
the center from a facility where single
enlisted men are given snacks and en-
tertainment to a community recreation
center offering a broad program for
all segments of the base population.
One center which introduced a program

of self-supporting recreation classes and
interest groups nearly doubled its at-
tendance in a six—month period. It
served more airmen than before and
a great many officers and families as
well.

At several bases, recreation center
councils demonstrated the impetus they
can give to the program. Councils, com-
posed of squadron representatives and
leaders of clubs and groups using the
center, advise the center director. They
provide an insight into the needs and
interests of the personnel. They con-
tribute creative ideas and enrich the
program, help plan and assist with spe-
cial events, secure equipment, and en-
list volunteers. They are invaluable in
publicizing the program since one of
the best methods is word of mouth.
Center council workshops have been
planned to further this program. The
workshops will bring together directors
and council members within an area
for training and exchange of ideas.
They will be developed and conducted
by the recreation staff of Headquarters

USAFE.
A PERENNIAL problem at a military
installation is the turnover of per-
sonnel and the consequent disruption of
continuity in programs. Clubs and in-
terest groups tend to have a high mor-
tality rate due to the rotation of key
leaders. It is here that recreation center
staffs play a vital role in maintaining
the continuity of these groups, help-
ing recruit new members, providing ad-
ministrative help and program plan-
ning.

An excellent tool for locating volun-
teers, discovering talent, recruiting club
members and for learning what inter-
ests exist on the base is an “interest
register.” The register is a card form
on which each newcomer to the base in-
dicates his special interest and skills.

RECREATION

Results of an NRA study on Air Force bases in Europe

It is turned over to the recreation staff
for their use.

Evaluation of recreation programs is
largely a subjective matter since sci-
entific devices do not exist to judge their
quality or the extent to which they give
personal satisfaction, contribute to per-
sonality growth, mental health, total fit-
ness, or to work performance. In order
to make the analysis as objective as pos-
sible an effort was made to establish a
criterion for appraising and comparing
programs. Recreation-center programs
were rated according to the extent they
provide (1) self-directed activities;
(2) entertainment; (3) passive activi-
ties; (4) miscellaneous services; (5)
interest groups and classes; and (6)
extension programs and services. These
program categories were defined as
follows:

Self-directed program provides the
facilities and equipment for self-direct-
ed activities, such as pool, table tennis,
shutHeboard, and card playing. People
participate without need for leadership
except when tournaments or special
events are planned.

Entertainment includes floor shows,
parties, special events, movies, bingo,
and other spectator activities which
people come to watch and enjoy. Oc-
casionally participation is involved as
at parties but the main factors are
watching and listening.

Passive recreation Opportunities pro-
vided by lounge facilities for reading,
writing letters, watching TV, snacks
and talking with friends or relaxing.
Miscellaneous services include in-
formation desks, telephone, tour serv-
ices, equipment for showing slides,
musical instruments, and others.
Interest groups and classes include
community t h e a t e r, square-dance
groups, stamp and coin clubs or any of
the infinite variety of special interests
and hobbies that exist.

SEPTEMBER, 1964

Extension services consist of ac-
tivities planned or aided by the cen-
ter staif which may be held outside the
center in the youth activities center,
gym, school, or elsewhere. It may be
assistance given by the center staif to
squadrons, wives9 clubs or other groups
in planning or conducting their own
programs.

While there was considerable varia-
tion in the ratings, some centers scor-
ing higher in the active participation
and some in the more passive types,
a comparison of the total number of
points for all bases in each of the cate-
gories shows the degree of emphasis be-
ing given to different program areas. It
was found that the most emphasis was
given to self-directed activities. Then,
in order, came passive recreation, mis-
cellaneous services, entertainment, in-
terest groups, and extension services
and activities.

It was interesting to see what cor-
relation there was between what the cen-
ters offer, what the people say they do
at the center, and what they feel the
center should offer. The largest num-
ber of people said they go to the cen-
ter for passive recreation; next for self-
directed activities, then entertainment,
interest groups, and services. However,
the poll showed that what people want
most are interest groups, then services,
passive recreation, and entertainment.
A surprisingly small percentage asked
for self-directed activities.

Apparently, the centers are doing a
good job of meeting the need for self-
directed and passive activities and a
substantial percentage of the people
want more interest groups. Intensive

plans are in progress to increase these
opportunities.

THE GREATER breadth and depth of

Air Force recreation programs in
recent years reflects the rise in the ed-

ucational level of its personnel. Accord-
ing to the records of the Education Di-
vision, Headquarters USAFE, the per-
centage of airmen in the US Air Force,
Europe, who have not completed high
school has dropped from 32.5 percent in
1956 to 11.2 percent in 1963. In ad-
dition to the general rise in the educa-
tional level, the demand for pe0ple cap-
able of mastering technical skills and
higher standards of selectivity is at-
tracting a better caliber of personnel.
These people have tastes, interests, and
needs that can be met only through a
stimulating, high quality recreation pro-
gram. The Air Force believes that it
should be “responsible to the nation for
returning to civilian life men, women,
and children who have continued to
grow and improve as citizens.”
Those in charge of Air Force recrea-
tion in USAFE are looking frankly at
the problems which must be overcome
if they are to meet their responsibilities.
The recreation-center appraisal is only
one of many steps being taken to enrich
and strengthen the program. Having
made great progress in improving rec-
reation management on all levels, atten-
tion turned to personnel, their selection
and training, and to program. Work-
shOps, program materials, and in-serv-
ice training aids are being used to raise
the level of base recreation services.
Equally important is a program of ed-
ucation and interpretation on the im-
portance of recreation and the need for

adequate support. One of the encourag-
ing revelations of the recreation cen-
ter study was the keen awareness and
understanding shown by wing and base
commanders of the value of recreation.
There is heartening evidence that rec-
reation is taking its proper place
among essential base services. #

NEW NRA PROJECTS

Vital services to meet needs of ever-expanding field

HE ANNUAL MEETING of the National Recreation Asso-

T ciation Board in May authorized the executive
director to proceed with plans for the following new

and vital Association services:
0 Establishment of an office in Washington, D.C. to give
special attention to federal and state recreation matters.
The NRA Washington representative will analyze, interpret
and report on pending federal and state recreation legisla-
tion, actively involve the Association and its Service Asso-
ciates and Affiliates in the development of federal recreation-
related activities, assist state and local agencies in dealing
with federal recreation agencies, and serve federal recre-
ation agencies in every way possible.
0 Provision of a William M. Hay-Harold W. Lathrop Na-
tional Fellowship in connection with the establishment of
the Washington office. The holder of this fellowship would
serve as executive of the Washington office and as assistant
executive director of the Association in charge of federal
and state relationships. It is also hoped that the holder of
this fellowship will work closely with the National Con-
ference on State Parks and all other organizations having
a special interest in recreation on the state and federal
levels.

This fellowship is being established to honor William Hay
and Harold W. Lathrop, both of whom served as members
of NRA’s staff with special responsibility for federal and
state recreation matters in the states assigned to them, the
former from 1947 to 1960 and the latter from 1946 to 1957.
Both of them had also served as a state director of parks—
Mr. Hay in Tennessee (1937-1947) and Mr. Lathrop in
Minnesota (1935-1946) and in Colorado (1957-1961).
Both had also been very active in the National ConferenCe
on State Parks and were life members of its board of direc-
tors. Mr. Hay died in 1960 and Mr. LathrOp in 1961.

0 Establishment of a National Institute of Recreation
Research.

0 Establishment of a Lebert H. Weir National Fellowship
in honor of Lebert H. Weir who served on the Association’s
staff from 1910 to 1949 and who was the outstanding
authority in the country on parks and recreation during
that period. The holder of this national fellowship will
serve as f a) advisor to the Board of Trustees of the NRA
on park planning and administrative matters, (b) associ-
ate editor of RECREATION magazine for parks, (0) a visiting
professor and curriculum advisor to colleges and universi-
ties with major courses in recreation, (d) consultant on
park matters to recreation executives and agencies by direct
consultant services in the field and indirectly from head-
quarters through correspondence, and (e) author and
lecturer on park plans and administration. It is hoped that
he will also work closely with the American Institute of
Park Executives and the National Conference on State Parks

344

and all other organizations havinga special interest in parks.

The person selected for this fellowship will be the most
outstanding person in the field of park administration and
planning. He might be either a retired park executive or
educator or a person still active in a park agency or educa-
tion institution who would be on leave of absence during
his service as the Lebert H. Weir National Fellow.

0 Addition of a professional staff member to the NRA Field
Department to specialize in county and rural park and rec-
reation matters and to work closely with the National Asso-
ciation of Counties and the National Association of County

Park and Recreation Officials.

0 Establishment of a National Center for the Advancement
of Recreation to be directed by a national citizens committee.
The program of the center would be directed toward (a)
educating citizens and citizen groups as to the needs, the
opportunities, and the potentials of recreation, and (b) in-
creasing involvement and participation of leading citizens
and citizen groups in support of local, state and federal
recreation agencies. It would include (a) proposed Friends
of Recreation Program, (b) proposed Board and Commis-
sion Services, and (0) proposed National Citizens Commit-
tee for the Advancement of Recreation.

0 Establishment of a National Center for Recreation Lead-
ership Education to strengthen leadership in public and
private recreation agencies. The program for this center
would include (a) a survey and study of the recreation
profession, (b) a national recruiting program, (0) a na-
tional scholarship program, and (d) a national post-entry
training service.

0 Addition of a professional staff member to the Associ-
ation’s Consulting Service on Recreation for the 111 and
Handicapped to work closely with the National Association
of Recreational Therapists, with the Hospital Section of the
American Recreation Society, and with all other organiza-
tions having an interest in this special field.

0 Construction of a new NRA headquarters building in
New York City which would serve as a national showcase
for recreation.

0 Establishment of a National Academy and Hall of Fame
in the new building to honor past, present, and future pro-
fessional and lay leaders in the field of recreation and parks
and in such other fields as education and social work so

far as they are related to recreation.

The Board also authorized the Executive Committee to
consider the possibility of inviting the presidents or chair-
men of the boards of other selected related professional
and other special-interest organizations in the recreation
and park field to serve on NRA’s Board of Trustees in ex
officio capacities but with full voting and other rights and

duties of NRA Trustees. #

Pattern for successful coordination
of school-community recreation services in Pasadena, California - J

Edward E. Bignell

HERE ARE many

ways to skin a
cat, and just as
many different and
successful ways to
administer com-
munity recreation
throughout Amer-
ica.- No two communities are exactly
alike. All have traditions, social and
economic differences, geographical dif-
ferences, et cetera, which make them
unique. The key to success is having
the administrative pattern which best
fits the local community and most ef-
fectively serves its citizens.

In Pasadena, California, the admin-
istrative pattern which through forty-
one years has produced effective serv-
ices is the “coordinated plan.” Under
this plan, the board of education ad-
ministers the total community recrea-
tion program for all age groups, with
financial assistance from the Pasadena
City Board of Directors and Los An-
geles County Board of Supervisors.

The school district and city limits are
not coterminous. The Pasadena Unified
School District is larger than the city
--—-taking in unincorporated areas—-
with a total population to be served of
approximately two hundred thousand,
while the population of Pasadena’s city
limits is 122,000.

The Board of City Directors con-
tracts with the board of education, re-
questing the school board to adminis-
ter recreation within the city limits.

 

————~_'

 

MR. BIGINELI. is director of school and
municipal recreation in Pasadena,
California.

346

The city makes four quarterly payments
for its share of the costs (approximate-
ly half). Furthermore, the contract
sets up a recreation commission consist-
ing of two (of the seven) city directors
appointed to the commission, two (of
the five) board of education members
appointed to the commission; then
these four board members recommend
five community members for a total
commission membership of nine. Both
the school and city boards must ap-

 

prove appointment of all community
members, who serve three-year terms.

The commission is advisory to the
two local boards. The director of rec-
reation, who serves under the superin-
tendent of schools in an administrative
certificated basis, is executive secretary
to the commission. He also serves un-
der the city manager as a city depart-
ment head to carry out the municipal
part of the coordinated program.

The County Board of Supervisors en-
ters into a contract with the board of
education to assume part of the costs

for recreation programs in the unin-
corporated areas within the Unified
School District and, like the city of
Pasadena, requests the school board to
administer this program. With the
three governments contributing finan-
cially to the program, the school dis-
trict operates community recreation.
All school, city, and county facilities
are made free of charge to the one co-
ordinated recreation department. The
department can easily schedule use of
any of these school facilities, including
swimming pools, gyms, athletic leIdS,
classrooms, et cetera. Moreover, the
staff has easy access to the civic audi-
torium and all city neighborhood, dis-
trict, and regional parks in order to
carry out the community-wide program.

Thus, all of the facilities are pooled,
and there is no other public recreation
department competing for them.

Since the recreation commission must
rely on school and city public recrea-
tion facilities, the staff and commis-
sioners are given the responsibility to
help plan these recreation facilities; For
example, all of the high schools and the
junior college have double swimming
pools (separate diving tanks). Fur-
thermore, one- to two-foot L’s have been
added to the shallow end of the larger
pools, resulting in truly community
pools where tots can be taught to swim
as well as older age groups, in addition
to the school-year physical-education
classes. All secondary school swimming
pools are taken over in the summer
months by the recreation department
for community operation during day
and evening hours.

by Charles E. DoeII $5.50

der this organization plan which has
proven effective and efficient. The per-
capita cost of the coordinated plan is
low. e

By having school administration, it
is easy for recreation to be articulated
with the curriculum and have close
carryover in such subject fields as phys-
ical education, art, music, science, so-
cial studies, et cetera. One other close
tie is in carrying out one of the seven
cardinal principles of education: to
provide for the constructive use of
leisure (education for leisure). There
are many other advantages to the co-
ordinated plan; however, it is recog-
nized that no government has exclusive
authority over the field of public rec-
reation. Many factors at the local lev-
el must in the final analysis be the key
points in ascertaining whether the city
should administer recreation, the school
board should do it, or if there should
be a coordinated plan—as exists in
Pasadena—or some other combination.
The organization pattern must reflect
the taxpayers’ interests. After more

than forty years of success, Pasadena
likes its coordinated plan. #

RESEARCH BRIEFS

 

Updated Master Plan

THE ORIGINAL master plan for the recreation park system

in Palo Alto, California, was prepared in 1954, and in-
corporated into the 1955 General Plan for the city. In 1958,
the city council requested the recreation department to re-
view and update the master plan and made the same request
in the fall of 1962. Palo Alto has now issued an attractive
report consisting of fifty-eight pages plus a number of tables
and charts. Entitled Recreation-Park Study 1963, the report
reviews and re-evaluates the present status of the Palo Alto
Park and Recreation system’s general aims and objectives,
the progress achieved since 1958, and the socio-economic
changes that have taken place.

The changes from 1950 to 1962 are most significant.
Population has doubled, from 25,475 to nearly 55,000. The
geographical area tripled, from 4,467 to 14,290 acres. The
city’s assessed value has grown from $52,905,035 to $195,-
153,430. Employment has increased from 9,897 to more
than 21,000. It is estimated that annual payroll has umped
from $30,000,000 to over $150,000,000. Retail sales have
increased from $55,508,380 to almost $150,000,000, an ap-
preciable portion of which has been spent for sporting goods
and apparel, equipment, and services for recreation and
leisure. School population (kindergarten through twelfth
grade) has risen from 5,419 to almost 14,900 during the
same twelve-year period, resulting in a growth in school
areas and facilities: from eight to nineteen elementary
schools, from one to three junior high schools, and from one
to two high schools, all within city limits.

The general aim of Palo Alto’s park and recreation pro-
grams is to “‘maintain and enhance the physical attractive-
ness of the community and to provide leisure pursuits which
are creative, meaningful, and satisfying; to help individuals
find pleasure in constructive activity—physical, social, cul-
tural, and artistic.

A limited number of the Palo Alto report are available for
$2.60 each from Alec Smith, Superintendent of Recreation,

Recreation Department, Community Center, 1305 Middle-
field, Palo Alto, California.

Beach Operations

A STUDY of “The Operation of Public Beaches in the Los

Angeles Region,” conducted by the Recreation and
Youth Services Planning Council of Los Angeles, found that
there is substantial evidence and support for county govern-
ment to be the primary supplier of regional recreation areas.

The study also found that:

with respect to standards of service, beach operating regu-
lations, use of equipment, operating costs and financing of
beaches, or development of shoreline resources.
0 A reasonable or equitable formula for the present allo-
cations from the County of Los Angeles to the cities for oper-
ating public beaches is not presently being used.
0 There is a great variance in the beach “operating unit”
costs among the five major beach operating agencies.
0 The Los Angeles city taxpayer pays approximately two
and a half times as much for beach services as the non-beach
city taxpayer.

The study chairman was William J. McCann with Sterl-
ing S. Winans as project consultant and Dr. Edwin J. Staley

as coordinator.

Valuable Natural Resources

HE Tennessee Valley Authority has made public a report

in popular form projecting the importance of fish and
wildlife in the economic future of the Tennessee Valley and
describing some of the scientific investigations and conser-
vation measures necessary to fulfill the potential benefits.
In pointing out the many millions of dollars in economic
return which can result from sport fishing, commercial fish-
ing, musseling, and wildlife management, the report empha-
sizes the need to continue the close working relationships

between state and federal agencies dealing with these mat-
ters.

“Important as fish and wildlife resources are today, there
is good reason to believe that their contribution to economic
growth can be even greater in years to come,” said Charles
J. Chance, chief of TVA’s Fish and Wildlife Branch. “Our
population is increasing. Leisure time is increasing. In-
comes are increasing. Thus, more people will have more
time and money with which to pursue the pleasures of hunt-
ing and fishing.

“Meeting these needs and goals will require continuous
scientific investigation of the biological and economic fac-
tors contributing to the use of fish and wildlife resources. It
will require continued cooperation of the type that has been
so successful in the past. These efforts, in turn, can only be
carried on with the support and understanding of the people
of the area. -

“TVA fish and wildlife biologists, after more than three
decades of study and experimentation, have set some dimen-
sions on the economic value of fish and wildlife. But they
have gone further. They have projected these values into
the future, indicating the potential that can be realized in
coming decades and the steps necessary to achieve that po-
tential. TVA believes that these findings and projections will
help promote public understanding of the role of fish and
wildlife in the region’s future.”

the booklet, Fish and Wildlife: Valuable Natural Resources,

lation of floodlights in the Irish

Hills of Michigan, enabling sports
lovers to play golf there in summer or
ski there in winter, is the best thing
to happen in southeastern Michigan
since Henry Ford gave up repairing
watches and began making cars. N inety-
four vapor floodlights illuminate a ser-
ies of slopes encircling a small lake in
the heart of the Irish Hills, a geological
freak of nature made up of a cluster of
sandy mounds and fresh water lakes
thirty miles west of Detroit and fifty
miles north of Toledo, in an area of the
Midwest, most of which, as far as the
eye can see, lies as flat as an ironing
board.

It’s not only the monotony of the
plains that causes Midwesterners to
flock to the new Irish Hills Sports Park,
world’s first combination floodlighted
golf and ski resort. It also boasts one
of the most efficient sports floodlighting
systems anywhere, simply because it is

THE Irish Hills are aglow! Instal-

in use almost continuously.

The Hills are visited every summer
by thousands of tourists, who stay in
camps surrounding each of fifty-two
lakes in the area. Skiers by the hun-
dreds ski there every day or night that
the temperature is at 28 degrees F or
lower; when it isn’t, resort operator
Cene Sell makes snow for them.

Floodlighting is helping pay back an
investment of nearly $500,000. Irish
Hills Sports Park had been a nine-hole
public golf course for fourteen years.
Then, a year ago, Mr. Sell decided to
take advantage of the natural ski ter-
rain. He saw that no earth would have
to be moved, no slopes built. All he
would have to do to guarantee good
skiing would be to outfit his resort with
a $51,000 snow-making compressor and
piping system, even though the Hills lie
in a natural snow belt and receive twen-
ty to thirty percent more snow than falls
in Detroit. Finally, of the eighty-three
winter sports centers in Michigan-—
more than in any other state in the na-
tion—only Irish Hills would be situat-
ed in the well-populated south.

THE BEAUTY of the Hills in both sum-
mer and winter, the dual sports fa-
cilities, plus the relaxing atmosphere
of the chalet, complement one another.
Floodlighting enhances this relation-
ship. To a golfer on the ninth green, the
chalet under Hoodlights looks even more
inviting than during the day. And to
skiers, out on one of the dozen slopes
at Irish Hills, the chalet under lights
is a warm haven. Anyone watching
golfers or skiers from the chalet din-
ing room or sundeck, finds the flood-
lighted scene endlessly changing.

 

Floodlighting was engineered for the
golf course, then adapted for skiing.
The slopes at Irish Hills form a large L
around the lake; those on the west leg
slope northeast while those on the north
leg slope south. Biggest problems in
lighting the course were: keeping the
lights directed over the backs of the
players and assuring foot-candle levels
of ten for the greens and five for the
fairways. Because only the greens are
flat, getting adequate lighting levels
over the entire lengths of the uneven
fairways was a formidable job.

Of the ninety-four luminaires, eight
are the quartz-iodine type and were
added after the original floodlights were
installed; they were used to illuminate
several valleys that still remained in
shadows after the fairways and greens
were lighted. The hole with the most
lights is the fifth, which angles around
the foot of the lake for 337 yards; the
third hole, only 118 yards long, has six
floodlights; the remaining holes either
have seven, eight, nine, or ten units, de-
pending upon their length, width and
terrain characteristics.

Most of the floodlights are Crouse-
Hinds 700-watt mercury vapor (Type
M V M ) and are cross-mounted on wood-
en poles set forty feet above grade.
Graduated vertical stops adjustable
through 120 degrees permit complete

Anyone watching golfers or skiers
from the chalet finds the
floodlighted scene an ever-changing
and fascinating spectacle.

l A private sports facility, ablaze with new ideas,

swing over of each unit for servicing, or
repositioning.

Because the floodlights are mercury
vapor, they emit a bluish-tinged light
that gives fairway grass a hue of rich
forest green. Even adjacent brown
spots, worn dusty at the tees, are clear-
ly discernible, and the greens, of course,

’ are bright and shadowless. Although
’ yellow golf balls can be seen better un-

der mercury vapor floodlights, ordin-
ary white ones work just as well.

l I ‘HE FIRST HOLE is typical; it has ten
luminaires covering 270 yards.

L Four lights are on —a pole adjacent to
i the chalet; two of these illuminate the

first hole tee, the other pair illuminate
half of the first hole fairway.

Another pole, also equipped with
four Hoodlights, illuminates the remain-

der of the fairway and the green, using

 

two units for each area. Although set
in the fairway, this pole is off to the far
right, out of the playing area. A third
pole, located on the far left of the fair-

“ way parallel to the green, has two units
‘ directed onto the first hole green.

A slight roll in the middle of the fair-

: way dictated the position of the second

pole. And throughout the course, it
was the mid-point fairway pole that al-
ways was erected last, so that once the

tees and greens were lighted, illuminat-
ing the approaches to the fairway could
be tailored to fit exactly particular ter-
rains.

Fairway floodlights are narrow beam,
those for the tees and greens are wide
beam. Ballasts—necessary for the op-
eration of mercury vapor lamps—are
the indoor type, protected by weather-
proof enclosures and pole-mounted at
heights readily accessible to a repair-
man on the ground.

To minimize glare, the Hoodlighting
system takes ingenious advantage of
the course’s hilly slopes. When a play-
er starts out on the course’s first leg,
playing the first and second holes, he
is on high ground, with the Hoodlights
behind him also on high ground. As
he progresses, he moves to low ground
and plays back in the direction from
which he originally started, again with
the floodlights behind him. He does this
in perfect comfort because the flood-
lights now facing him are on high
ground—high enough, in fact, that he
does not even notice them. The same
situation is true for the other course
leg. Thus, at no time does a player tee
off into glaring light.

’ I ‘HE SPORTS PARK has a dozen slopes
equipped either with T-bars or
tows. More than two hundred acres are

available, most of it for cross-country
skiing. The heavily traflicked advanced
slopes offer runs of over one thousand
feet and trails up to two thousand feet.
Toboggan runs can be used, and the
lake is ideal for skating. Underground
pipes run to all slopes, feeding water
to greens and tees in summer, and in
winter twin pipes — one for air, the
other for water—~make “snow” when-
ever the weather fails to do so.

To capitalize on the floodlighting for
skiing, Mr. Sell hires a power company
lineman in late fall to redirect the lum-
inaires from their summer settings and
change them over for winter. The job
takes a day. Each floodlight not already
facing across or down a slope is aimed
in one of those directions. At the same
time, the floodlight system is cleaned
and, if necessary, relamped.

Because of the illumination levels re-
quired for golf—ten f.c. for the greens
and tees and five f.c. for the fairways—
the snow-covered slopes glow with a
light equivalent to as much as twenty
times that used to illuminate many city
streets. #

as a member in her capacity as chair-
man of the National Association of
County Park and Recreation Officials
for a threeoyear term ending in 1967
or until her successor as chairman there-
of is elected and takes office, whichever
is earlier.

Ralph and Grace Nelson, a husband-
and-wife team with a combined total
of more than seventy-two years of out-
standing service with the Chicago Park
District, were honored at a retirement
party in June. Ralph was assistant di-
rector of employe activities at the time

of his retirement on May 14, while
Grace is a physical-activities supervisor
and is retiring soon.

Ralph began his park service with
the South Park District in 1929 as an
instructor. He served in various south-
side parks in this capacity and as a
park supervisor until he attained his
present title in 1948. Perhaps his out-
standing contribution was during
World War II when he conducted pro-
gram activities at the Servicemen’s
Center which became known through-
out the world for its outstanding treat-
ment of service personnel.

Grace Nelson is probably best known
for her devotion and dedication to the
sport of tennis while in the recreation
field. She began her career in the South
Parks in 1930 as a physical instructor,
later becoming a playground super-
visor in 1947. After attaining her pres-
ent title, her interest in tennis brought
the entire program in the park district
under her control where it was expand-

ed and intensified.

Dr. Earle F. Zeig-

ler is the new head
of the department
of physical educa-
tion for men in the

at the
University of Illin-
ois in Urbana. He succeeds Professor
C. 0. Jackson, department head since
1958, who asked to be relieved of ad-
ministrative duties to devote full time
to teaching and research. Dr. Zeigler
has been a member of the Illinois facul-

IN MEMORIAM

 

o HOWARD ZAHNISER, one of the coun-
try’s leading conservationists, died re-
cently in Hyattsville, Maryland, at the
age of fifty-eight. Mr. Zahniser was an
early advocate of the national policy of
wilderness preservation and played a
prominent role in drafting in 1955-56
of the Wilderness Bill (HR. 930, 5.4)
still before Congress. Since 1945, Mr.
Zahniser had been executive director
of the Wilderness Society and had writ-
ten extensively on wilderness, parks,
and other conservation subjects.

0 DOROTHIE FISHER, a founder of the
New York City Parks Department’s
Marionette Theater, died recently after
a long illness at the age of fifty. She
joined the parks department in 1937 as
a recreation leader. The Marionette
Theater was established in 1940 and
now has a staii of fifteen, hundreds of
marionettes, and some five thousand
pounds of equipment. '

o FREDERICK C. SUTRO, president emer-
itus of the New Jersey Parks and Rec-
reation Association and an architect
of the state’s Green Acres program,
died in June at the age of eighty-six.
Mr. Sutro’s interest in parks and rec-
reation dated from 1912 when Wood-
row Wilson, then governor of New Jer-
sey, named him a commissioner of the
Palisades Interstate Park Commission.
He was a pioneer in shaping the state’s
360,000,000 Green Acres bond issue
for the purchase of open land for park
development passed in 1961.

SMOOTH SKATING

Roland (Pat) Lachance

XPERIENCE with ice-skating areas
E proves that spraying too early
will only set back the first skat-
ing date. Frost must penetrate four to
six inches before the ground will hold
water. If, before the heavy frost comes,
the ground has lost moisture from lack
of rain or evaporation, it will be help-
ful to spray the whole area to allow the
ground to freeze more solidly. When
the ground has frozen to the above
thickness, then proceed with caution.
Apply two or three light sprays, just
enough to fill the voids and small de-
pressions. It will take two or three nights
to get an ice sheet started sufficiently so
as to be able to flood the area with an
inch or two of water when the tempera-
ture drops below the twenty-degree
mark. Too much water will pull the
frost out of the ground and disappear.
Caution in applying water will let you
have ice earlier than if you try to hasten
the size or smoothness of the ice.
Lime spread over the ice sheet with
a cyclone-type spreader after the ground
has been knit into a solid bloc will give
a lighter surface and prevent the sun
rays from melting it. After the lime is
spread evenly, a few light sprays will
seal it and then water may be poured on
in greater volume.
Natural Ice. Some years we are for-
tunate in having a series of cold days
and nights to allow the ice to thicken
before a snowfall. This is wonderful be-
cause the ice surface will be good, hard,
black ice and if the first snowfall isn’t
too heavy it can be removed. When the
ice formed on a pond is only a few
inches thick and snow covers it, the
weight of the snow will sink the 'ice
enough to wet the snow and form slush.
To hasten freezing at the edges, the
snow must be removed around the
whole perimeter intended to be used.
In our case, this means completely

around the pond, as far out as can be
reached, so as to expose the ground two
or three feet back from the water’s edge.
If this is not done, the snow will act as
a sponge or blotter, and it will take real
cold weather to harden the edges
enough to permit men or equipment
upon the ice.

Soil Texture. An important consider-
ation in planning a neighborhood ice
skating area is soil texture. Coarse sand
is the best type. It is easier to grade
and shape, the frost will penetrate deep-
er, and the area under the ice is more
stable than heavy loam, clay, or silt.
Shape of an Area. An ice-skating
area can be many shapes, but a circular
type will give more skating area than a
square or rectangular one. If ice hock-
ey is to be discouraged, so small chil-
dren can skate, a circular type will work
out better. If hockey is to be played,
the rink should be in proportion to
eighty-five by two hundred feet.

Soil Surfaces. If possible, the out-
door hockey rink should be higher than
the surrounding ground. Twelve inches
of sand, with four to six inches of wash.
ed, three-quarter-inch gravel on top,
finished off with a light coating of sand,
will make a good base for the rink. Why
the gravel on top of the sand? The
stone retains the cold and frost so if a
sudden thaw comes along you will not
lose the ice surface. 4'}:

THE SNOWSHOE
LEAGUE

Alice Roth, Director of Youth Activities,
Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

THE DAFFODILS
were smiling in
sunny California
but there was still
plenty of white
stuff on the ground
in Alaska. None-
theless, at Fort
Wainwright, Alaska, the army’s most
modern northern post, Youth Activities
members were hit by a touch of Spring
fever during April. The ice rinks were
wet, the ski slope was icy, the tempera-
ture soared abdve zero, and the children
got baseballitis!

Snow and softball! This is hard to
believe, hard to run, and harder still to
field a line drive wearing a pair of bear-
trap snowshoes. This year, Fort Wain-
wright and Eielson Air Force Base girls
competed in the annual snowshoe soft-
ball game. Youth Activities at Fort
Wainwright sponsored the afternoon
program which was played in twenty-
four-degrec weather during continuous
snow Hurries! Although the score was
6-6, it is doubtful that anyone remem-
bers, as it was more fun watching the
girls slide or run the bases with snow-
shoes instead of spikes. Sometimes,
they literally crawled on hands and
knees with snowshoes wagging behind
them.

This annual affair triggers the sum-
mer baseball season which has over
three hundred swinging and pitching
participants. This phase of the Wain-
wright Youth Activities program is
unique. Junior baseball preseason prac-

 

358

tice begins the end of April while the
opening day of the season is May 30,
when all teams on post participate. Fort
Wainwright boasts three girls’ softball
teams, six major and six minor Little
League teams, two Babe Ruth teams,
and one Connie Mack team.

The Army and Air Force affiliate with
the civilian community of Fairbanks in
Babe Ruth and Connie Mack League
play and Girls’ Softball League play.
Wainwright has two Little League dia-
monds, a girls’ softball field, one Babe
Ruth and one Connie Mack diamond.
There are several practice diamonds lo-
cated around the post so that these of-
ficial diamonds are not used for prac-
tice.

This year, each of the Junior Baseball
teams was sponsored by a troop unit on
post from which the manager and coach
is assigned. The reSponsibilities of these
sponsors are set forth in a Yukon Com-
mand Circular which states that spon«
sors:

«- Organize parental and unit support
to include furnishing of managers and
coaches for Sponsored team.

0 Provide tranSportation for unit per-
sonnel to and from games.

0 Coordinate with chief umpire and
official scorekeeper for personnel to
work the games.

0 Assist in preparation of ballfields
prior to opening of season and provide
personnel for preparation of ballfield
prior to sponsored team’s home games
and police upon conclusion of games.

- Render all assistance other than tech-

nical advice. If an insufficient number .

of parents of members of a team are
assigned to the sponsoring unit, contact
of commanders to which parents are

assigned may be in order to accomplish
sponsor mission.

Post engineers are asked only to as-
sist in field preparation, provide electri-
cal connections of scoreboards and re-
freshment booths. Parents provide such
assistance as the sponsor may deem
necessary, such as cutting the grass, tak-
ing of infields, preparation of fields
prior to games, and policing of fields
after games. The Youth Activities Coun-
cil (a self-supporting organization), as-
sisted by the Little League Women’s
Auxiliary, provides funds for equip-
ment for these teams.

Although the children in the “Land
of the Midnight Sun” may start pre-
season practice later than our friends in
sunny California, the 49th’s Little
Leaguers are just as avid players and
boast, “We’re the only state where a

Little League game can be played at
midnight—without lights.”

recreation is supposed to be for every-
one. ln Newark, California, the recre-
ation department has been concerned

Kenneth N. Stange

RECREATION

3 who call or come to the office asking,
: “How do I go about getting on a has-

1 ketball team?”
‘ them to the gym where teams are prac-

Naturally, we refer

ticing. However, unless the individual

. is an outstanding player it is next to

impossible to get on a team. This year
we can place these individuals on a
team because of our new 810 Break
Basketball program.

Who is eligible? Anyone, over twenty
years of age, regardless of height,
weight, or ability. For participation in
the league, one merely has to go to the
gym and sign up.

How are the teams selected? The gym
attendant selects team captains on the
basis of basketball knowledge and lead-
ership qualities. This group, together
with the gym attendant, then becomes
an evaluating committee. All partici-
pants are evaluated on a plus, zero, and
minus basis. With this information,

' each team is balanced with an equal

number of players according to their
rating.

How is the program financed? Adult
programs generally are expected to be
at least partially self supporting. The
question was how to accomplish this in

' lieu of the normal league fee. The fact

that the players were put together as a

_ team made it impractical to request that

sponsors be obtained. We borrowed a

 leaf from the bowling leagues. The fee

was set at fifty cents per game with each
team captain, as in bowling, responsible
for collecting this fee and submitting it
to the gym attendant. With nine play-
ers per team, this amounts to $4.50 per
team per game, or with a schedule of
nine games a sponsorship fee of $40.50
is accomplished in a relatively easy and
acceptable manner.

How does the game differ from reg-
ular basketball? In essence, the game
is the same as regulation basketball,
with two major exceptions. First, the
fast break is eliminated, and, second,
aggressive activity beneath the boards
is controlled. In order to understand the
first point, an explanation of the second
factor will shed some light upon the
subject. Once the offensive team brings
the ball across half court, regular bas-
ketball rules are enforced until a shot is
attempted. If the offensive team can
control the boards, it can continue
.shooting until a defensive man gets the

SEPTEMBER, 1964

ball. Once this happens, the ball cannot
be taken away. The former offensive
team now becomes the defense and
must go down court and set up its de-
fense. The offensive team can thus leis-
urely bring the ball up court. It cannot
cross the half court line until the referee
sees that the defense is set and then
blows his whistle to signal the offense
to move across. This time element has
been carefully measured. It is still less
than ten seconds, yet there is not the
overexertion on the part of the players
to get down court and stop the fast
break, since none is allowed. The fast
break is also eliminated on jump balls.

The only other major difference is
the fact that everyone must play one
half of the game. Players of lesser abil-
ity are therefore not forced to sit on the
bench while the others perform.

Does the game really work? Approx-
imately three-fourths of the players in
the league had previously given up ac-
tive participation in basketball for one
reason or another. In our league, play-
ers up to forty years of age are partici-
pating with no evidence of over-exer-
tion. As of the night of the first league
game, sufficient inquiries regarding Slo
Break Basketball had been made that
we could have had another league had
we planned for it.

DUAL-PURPOSE
RANGE

Robert Lowe, Superintendent of Parks
and Recreation, Berlin, New Hamp-
shire.

HAT DO YOU DO with an old
armory? In 1959, the city of
Berlin, New Hampshire, had the first
call on purchasing for a small sum a
National Guard armory, built on city
property. With a new armory about
ready to be occupied, the city purchas-
ed the old building and turned it over
to the Parks and Playgrounds Commis-
sion. Thus, Berlin, a paper-manufac-
turing center with a predominantly
French population, became the first
New Hampshire city to acquire an old
armory for recreation. Since then sev-
eral towns have acquired one and others
are in the process.
Situated in the armory basement was

a pistol range, which was being used by
a men’s pistol club, 4H club, and for a
once-a-year gun-safety program. Mem-
bers of a neighborhood horseshoe
league felt that the range could perhaps
serve a dual purpose as a gun and horse-
shoe range. The parks and recreation
director appointed a committee to meet
with interested players and from the
first meeting came forth many ideas on
a well-constructed horseshoe range that
has the whole town talking. Roland Nic-
oletti, parks and playground mainte-
nance foreman, supervised the entire
project.

The range was fifty feet in length and
twelve feet in width and had an eleven-
and-a-half-foot ceiling which was a little
bit low, but ways and means were made
to take care of that problem. The
cement floor was broken and a frame
was set in. The pits were made even
with the original Hoor, so no ceiling
space was lost. Pins were placed forty
feet apart and at each end a heavy gal-
vanized-wire open frame was set in
cement to prevent shoes from hitting
anyone. This open frame provided the
players waiting their turns and others
a chance to see the game and each play.
In front of each horseshoe pit, a heavy
rubber matting was cemented to the
concrete Hoor for protection to players
and to prevent cracks to the floor.

The league is made up of two divi-
sions, one for day workers and one for
shift workers. League records and
standings are kept by the department.
All games appeared in local paper and
on radio sports program. This inter-
esting activity provides many happy
hours of leisure time recreation in this
northern New Hampshire city.

Every experienced recreation leader knows that parties
can be fun, fiesta, or fiasco. The difference is planning
— applying time-tested basic procedures. The following
party plan was compiled by the Bureau of Recreation, Divi-
sion of Parks and Recreation, Department of Welfare, Day-
ton, Ohio, and was sent to us by John Mahan, Dayton’s as-
sistant recreation general supervisor.

on getting that next party organized. If you really

want to make it something to remember, get a com-
mittee together to plan it. You’ll have more fun at the plan-
ning meeting than at the actual party later. We like to or-
ganize a party committee into four subcommittees, with a
chairman of each, working in close cooperation with each
other, or, better yet, with a general chairman for the whole

party.

BUILD UP. This subcommittee “builds up” anticipation
and curiosity so that it’s very difficult for folks to stay away
from your party. This can be done in many ways, through
word of mouth, impromptu skits at meetings in the county
held previous to the actual party, through unusual posters
and bulletins, and an attractive invitation with an unusual
angle which does not have very close relationship to the
“circular letters” we so often don’t read.

ATMOSPHERE. This subcommittee does two important

things: sets the stage for the party through costuming and
decorations, and gives the first arrivals something specific
to do which puts them at ease and gets people into the “party
spirit.” It is important that anyone who arrives at a party
be made to feel comfortable and welcome, and this can often
be accomplished by having the guests actually make and put

up the decorations and add a note of costuming that {its the
party theme.

1' RE YOU PLANNING A PARTY? Here are some suggestions

PROGRAM. This subcommittee takes up right along with
the “atmosphere committee” very often. Its job is to see that
the most people have the best time possible, and everyone
goes home a little better person for having participated in

your party. In outlining your program, here are some help-
ful hints.

0 Remember the size of group, age, and space you have to
work in when selecting activities.

0 Remember that “lopsided recreation” makes “lopsided”
personalities. So balance your program so it will have ap-

peal to a wider group than just those people who have
enough nerve to ask to do what they want.

0 Balance the leadership so that no one person is too out-

360

standingmhelp push out one or two new leaders at each
party.

0 Plan simple things early in the evening, moving gradually
to more challenging things after your group loses a little
starch.

0 Make use of smooth tricks and devices to move easily
from one formation to the next so that almost no time is tak-
en arranging people.

0 Taper off the party so the group has “mellowed” after the
climax of the party, with a few quieter events just before
the signature.

REFRESHMENTS. Instead of the usual “line-up-over-
here” attitude toward the refreshments, let’s have the sub-
committee plan something simple that will {it into the party
theme, and a method of serving that will be a “surprise.”
Don’t forget the possibilities in chair arrangements. If part
of the committee can fix little “conversation” circles of
chairs during the serving of refreshments or right before,
people will be in congenial groups to talk and not in the too
frequent lines of chairs outlining a dance or gym floor.

CLEAN UP! We’ve done away with thinking there needs

to be a special committee for this unlovely 0b; if each com-
mittee will take care of its own clean-up problems, the place
should be shipshape when all is over.

LEADERSHIP HINTS.

0 It’s easier to see what to do than hear what to do; you
learn twice as fast when you can do both. Demonstrate more
—talk less!

0 It’s easier to understand if you can be seen when exPlain-
ing; stand where everyone sees your “pretty side.”

0 It’s easier to create friendliness and spirit if you are in
the group and not apart from it whenever possible. Be a
part of and not apart from the party.

0 People will catch what you’ve got, be it boredom, nervous-
ness, or enthusiasm and friendliness. Smile—it’s contagious!
0 Control your group whenever possible without using a
microphone or a whistle as a crutch. Here are some ideas:

° Raising right hand and closing the mouth when the leader
does. (Best with younger people in camps, et cetera.)

° Use of musical phrase on piano, bells, or some appro-
priate sound fitting with the party theme.

' Use of a committee to quiet people in the different parts
of the room.

° Speaking in a slow, controlled voice and frequently chang-
ing the range of voice and the tempo.

° Having people seated, especially at the beginning of a

to PARADISE

Betty Parks

HE SETTING was exotic—a flower-

strewn pool, pseudo moonlight,
vine-covered walls, tiki gods. The “na-
tives,” attired in Bermuda shorts and
muumuus, gyrated endlessly to the beat
of drums. Bare feet followed the intri-
cate patterns of ancient tribal dances—
dances such as the “twist” with its

many variations of form.
The occasion was a recent club dance,

“Return to Paradise,” at a YMCA
branch in Seattle, Washington. The one
hundred dancers were ninth- through
twelfth-grade students at Sealth High
School. The unusual, and very profes-
sional, background for the party was
another creation of the Y’s Hi-Y Club.
Club members astound parents and Y
officials with their imaginative abilities.

Five years ago when Jack Latta, a
volunteer with an admirable degree of
stamina, offered his services as advisor
for the group, the Boys Junior Leader
organization was a sparsely attended
Hi-Y Club. He began with a mere hand-
ful of ninth-grade boys and two or three
bored sophomores and juniors. Today,
the club has a regular average weekly
attendance of forty boys. They assist in
the YMCA day-camp program, teach
swimming classes, and help with grade-
school athletics. They also take a very
active part in the Y youth and govern-
ment program.

At an age where they are very so-
cially minded, these high-school young-
sters decided to make their dances, held

three or four times a year, outstanding.

They have certainly achieved their goal.
Operating on a low budget, endowed
with vivid imaginations and a vast tal-

the YMCA in Seattle, Washington.

SEPTEMBER, 1964

 

Boys plan exotic parties that are the talk of the town

ent for making something from nothing,
the boys have turned the Y’s game room
into a Hawaiian beach, a spook house,
a waterfront—complete with a tramp
steamer docked at one end of the room
—a lost city, a South Sea island, and,
last but not least, a Roman orgy.

FrOm the viewpoint of chaperones,
the spook house was an endurance test.
Eerie shrieks, rattling chains, and the
constant pounding and groaning of
ghosts in torment made the night an
ear-splitting, nerve-wracking affair. The
weary chaperones agreed, however, that
the haunted-house atmosphere was very
well done—perhaps even too well done.
The chaperones also complained a bit
when the lost-city dance took place. En-
tering the remarkable ruins through a
small tunnel on their hands and knees
was hard on middle-aged joints and
muscles.

THE Roman orgy proved an outstand-
ing example of decorating, the ef-
fect being a cross between an early cat-
acomb and Pompei after its highly
regrettable demise. Shattered columns
lined the walls; a fountain splashed in
one corner in a bank of trees and flow-
ers; dry ice was tossed into the lighted,
glass punchbowl, creating a pink frothy
ambrosia; and platters of grapes were
served for refreshments.

The “Romans” were there in full
dress—black togas with gold braid,
pink fluorescent capes, purple capes,
gold capes, and plently of white togas
and gowns. Every househould found its
sheet supply unaccountably depleted
that week. Boys and girls alike sewed,
stitched, dyed, and called Upon mothers
for assistance.

In accordance with long-standing Y
policy, no one was fed to the lions, no
Christians were tortured, dancing girls
were not in evidence, the wine was miss-
ing, and slaves went unwhipped. It
might be assumed that such restrictions
would make for a pretty dull orgy.
Nonetheless, in their own modest fash-
ion, the teenagers had fun . . . proving
it does not take expensive entertainment.
to insure a good party.

AT THE all-club waterfront party,
Creg Norsen, a Sealth High School
junior, contributed notably to the at-
mosphere. He designed a tramp steam-
er, drew it on paper eighteen feet long
and eight feet high, and moored it
against a dock made of old hawsers,
tree stumps, and packing boxes. A huge
fishnet stretched from floor to ceiling
and wall to wall, serving as a barrier to
inquisitive dancers. The whole was
lighted with floods from beneath.

Creg, frequently assisted by class-
mate Dick DeFaccio, leads the group in
the art division of the decorating proj-
ects. All club members contributed to
the thinking one way or another, some
excelling in art, others in ideas; some
act as pickup and delivery men, others
have a Hair for management. All coop-
erate in turning the ideas into reality.
Paul Lantz can be depended upon to
take care of the music and supply
rhythms suitable to the approved back-
ground. When the actual decorations
are set in place, the entire club pitches
in. All work must necessarily be done
to the accompaniment of a recdrd play-
er turned up to an awesome volume.

The fountain used in the Roman orgy
was made over a period of five days on

363

a neighbor’s patio. Using vast quanti-
ties of old newspapers and gallons of
paste, the boys created tiered basins
from papier-maché. When it had dried,
they painted the tiers with some leftover
blue enamel found in one boy’s garage.
A child’s wading pool was used as the
bottom base. A small pump was bor-
rowed to circulate the water.

BY INVESTIGATING attics and base-
ments, including those of the

YMCA building, the boys have refur-
bished castoffs for their needs. An old
piece of bamboo screen turns into a

native but, and a worn wrestling mat is
flooring for a room in a haunted house.

The boys know instinctively who in
this suburban community will lend floor
cushions, bamboo for backdrops, fish-
nets, driftwood, floodlights, beach um-
brellas, and logs. They know whose

gardens can be depended upon for flow-
ers in season, whose shrubbery and
trees need pruning at Opportune mo-
ments.

An adult of a slightly different cal-
iber than adviSOr Jack Latta might have
quailed at the problems presented by
suggestions the boys dream up, but,
blessed with considerable imagination
and design ability himself, the young
Boeing Company employe has been
able, so far, to separate the possible
from the impossible. The decorating
idea was primarily the brainchild of the
original small group of boys Jack met
with five years ago. However, once the
teenage public had reviewed the origi-
nal props at the first Hawaiian beach
party, the club began to grow and the
ideas went into orbit. At the present
time, the party projects have become
something of a community tradition.

As the older boys graduate from the
club, well-trained freshmen and sopho-
mores eagerly step forward to fill their
places.

Parents, particularly those who have
chaperoned the dances, approve whole-
heartedly of the boys’ efforts. They ap-
prove, too, of the fact that the young-
sters can enjoy a fantastic evening’s en-
tertainmentbfor the very reasonable sum
of twenty-five or thirty cents. This
money pays for the refreshments.

The Y staff feels that as long as the
premises are not damaged, behavior is
good, and the decorations are carefully
removed, the boys are most welcome to
continue their projects. After all, the
parties have given the Y a certain dis-
tinction. It is not very often that the
wholesome atmosphere of any local

YMCA is enhanced by a Roman
orgyl #

 

Junior Sports Jamboree

Continued from Page 359

 

Community Services in cooperation
with the Illinois Junior Chamber of
Commerce. Local J aycee chapters con-
duct local meets, provide awards, and
also provide transportation to the sec-
tional meet for their local winners. Sec-
tional meets as well as the state meet
are also hosted by J aycee chapters with
assistance from local school, park, and
recreation personnel. Also, local staff
members of the Illinois Youth Commis-
sion assist on local meets, as well as at
sectionals and state meets.

The purpose of the junior sports jam-
boree is to provide an action program
that serves both youth fitness and delin-
quency prevention purposes. This pro-
gram encourages participation from
both boys and girls, including the “so-
called spectator athlete” and those not
active in school or public recreation
programs. In addition to providing the
obvious advantage of individual compe-
tition, the jamboree requires nothing
from the youth except the desire to com-
pete.

Growth of the program stateside as
outlined below is ample proof of its
value to communities in Illinois and

their youth:
364

1956
State Meet in Chicago: No participa-
tion from outside towns.

1 957
State Meet in Chicago: Four suburban
communities conducted local meets and
sent winners to the state meet.

1 958
State Meet in Chicago: Twelve commu-
nities conducted local meets and sent
winners to the state meet.

1959
State Meet in Springfield: Twenty-six
communities conducted local meets, sent
winners to one of four sectional meets
with sectional winners going to the state
meet. Ten thousand local participants.

1960
State Meet in Springfield: Sixty-five
communities conducted local meets,
sent winners to one of six sectionals
with sectional winners going to the state

meet. Thirty thousand local partici-
pants.

1961
State Meet in Champaign-Urbana:
Ninety-five communities conducted 10-
cal meets, sent winners to one of six
sectionals with winners going to the
state meet. Ferty-nine thousand local
participants.

1962
State Meet in Sterling: One hundred
and ten communities conducted local

meets, sent winners to eight sectionals
with winners going to state meet. Forty-
nine thousand local participants.
1963

State Meet in Bloomington-Normal:
One hundred and fifty-one communities
conducted local meets, sent winners to
twelve sectionals with winners going to
state meet. F ifty-five thousand local
participants.

Each local meet is furnished free of
charge the following program materials
by the Illinois Youth Commission: en-
try blanks, coaching aids, manuals, win-
ners lists, jamboree brochures, rule
books, event sheets, certificate of par-
ticipation, and sample news releases.
These materials are prepared to make it
easy for the untrained or trained adult
to conduct a jamboree.

In each community where a Junior
Chamber of Commerce chapter exists,
the chapter is given the opportunity to
sponsor a local jamboree. In cormnu-
nities where no chapter exists, or the
existing chapter chooses not to sponsor
a meet, another organization can spon-
sor a local amboree. Event winners of
locals advance to sectionals, and sec-
tional winners to the state finals. Con-
testants compete in the following age
divisions: Midgets, 10-11 years; Jun-
iors, 12-13 years; and Intermediates,
14-15 years. Remember, this program
is for both boys and girls.

DO-IT- Y0 URSELF PARK

Sarah E. U. Whitney

T HE East Concord [New Hamp-

shire] Women’s Club voted last

year to have the development of
the area adjacent to Merrill Playground
in the center of East Concord as its
entry in the Community Improvement
Contest. This contest is sponsored by
the General Federation of Women’s
Clubs and the Sears Roebuck F ounda-
tion. Awards are given every two years
to the best projects which show “whole-
hearted community cooperation, vision,
and action.”

This twelve-acre area.was purchased
by the city of Concord several years
ago with the idea that at some future
date the city would construct a park
there. After consulting with various
city officials, the Women’s Club was
given permission to use this area for
its project and Concord’s first “Do-It-
Yourself Park” came into being. An
ABC (Act to Beautify your Commun-
ity) Rally was held to inform the citi-
zens of East Concord of the plans, and
men, women and children were asked
to volunteer their time and services on
four consecutive Saturdays, starting the
end of September.

Preceding the actual start of work
on the project, the city engineer, the
city recreation director, the Soil Con-
servation Service, and Leslie S. Clark
joined the five committee women in
making specific plans for various sec-
tions. .

The area involved is rectangular and
is divided lengthwise by a brook which
is surrounded by a swamp almost en-
tirely overgrown with alders. The east-
ern side is a steep, wooded hillside

Forests.

which becomes an open field sloping

gradually to the brook. The western
side, adjacent to the playground, is
lower and more level. The southern
end is swampy and is heavily over-
grown with underbrush. The northern
end is an open field.

Plans are now being formulated for
the construction of a pond at the north-
ern end. This pond was called for in
the original plans'for the area prepared
by the city and the city will see to its
construction. Around the pond will be
an outdoor recreation area with fire-
places, benches and picnic tables. Trees,
shrubs and flowers will be planted. The
southern end is devoted to nature trails
for the observation of wildlife. It is
being left, as much as possible, in its
natural state.

ON FOUR consecutive Saturdays a
total of 119 volunteers, some work-
ing as individuals and some as members
of interested organizations, went into
the area equipped with axes, saws,
shovels, and brush cutters and cleared
two nature trails. After the men had
completed this work, women and chil-
dren piled brush off the trails to provide
wildlife shelters and game runways.
The Upper Trail which follows the
upper contour of the land on the wood-
ed hillside and open field is through
tall pines and hardwoods. Wildflowers
that grow in thin dry soil are found
here as well as birds of the upland and
open slopes. On this trail, where it dips
into a gully, an underground spring
was developed into a woodland pool
by means of an earthen dam. After
the pool was completed, women and
children planted violets, ferns and three
hundred narcissus bulbs around it.
The Brookside Trail on the western

side of the brook parallels the Upper
Trail. Here are ferns, viburnums, genti-
ans, and other typical marsh vegetation.
Red-wing blackbirds and other marsh-
loving birds live here, and many dead
trees have been left standing to attract
the woodpeckers. From this trail two
side trails branch off and the alders
were cut back to provide vistas of the
brook. Broken glass, tin cans, and other
debris were removed from the brook.

Two rustic bridges have been con-
structed of telephone poles and rail-
road ties. Since this wood has already
been impregnated with creosote, it will
not need further attention for years.

At one end of the field, a slope was
cleared for coasting and skiing and,
adjacent to this slope, five hundred
white spruce seedlings, supplied by the
State Forestry Department, were plant-
ed under the supervision of County
Forester Wilbur E. Thompson. Select-
ive cuttings of these trees will be made
in later years and will provide Christ-
mas trees for local schools, hospitals,
and clubs.

During the winter, various indivi-
duals volunteered to build rustic
benches, birdhouses, and trail signs
which will be placed along the trails
next spring. A group of children plan
to make a study of the trees, shrubs
and wildflowers, compile a list for refer-
ence, and label these items in the field
for easy identification. A third trail
will be cut and cleared which will run
along the swampy land on the same side
of the brook as the Upper Trail.

The natural beauty of our country-
side is an important resource, and the
citizens of all communities. should
maintain and improve their so-called
“green strips” wherever posible. These
areas can bring enjoyment to us now
and to future generations. #-

o ANSWERING THE NEED for a specific printing surface for
linoleum and wood blocks, Speedball Printmasters Block
Printing Paper can also be used for silk-screen printing. Soft
in texture, made to specific requirements for block printing,
it will add depth and feeling to handcraft prints. Conveni-
ently packaged in popular printcrafters sizes: 9”-by-12”,
12”-by-18”, and 18”-by-24”, it is inexpensive enough to fit
into even the smallest arts-and-crafts budget. Samples of the
paper can be obtained by writing to J. Johnson and Com-
pany, 51 Manhasset Ave., Manhasset, New York. Informa-
tion on block printing and a complete line of supplies is
available from Hunt Manufacturing Company, Camden,
New Jersey, the Speedball manufacturers (address inquiries
to the Educational Department) .

0 Easy does it. Moving heavy-duty gym equipment can
now be a one-man job. The Parallel Bar Transport Truck,
made of heavy steel construction, is engineered to allow one
person to attach and roll parallel bars and horses. Large
casters make the moving of heavy, awkward equipment easy.
The truck can be adjusted for transporting all makes of
parallels and horses and for older apparatus where casters
are not available. For further information, write to Gym-
nastic Supply Company, 247 West Sixth Street, San Pedro,
California.

0 SEATING PLAN. A new planning kit to aid in designing
lecture-room seating and portable seating for auditoriums
comes complete with a template making it possible to scale
layouts to a quarter inch and to determine the number of
seats for a given area. The kit shows two units with photo-
graphs of one riser and one floor mount. They are typical
lecture-room bases which can be fabricated to accommo-
date special conditions such as s10ping floors or very low
rises. Also shown is the way in which folding partitions can
be used to generate two separate lecture rooms or opened
to become part of a general auditorium. A list of areas in
a building, keyed to chair photos, is shown to aid in select-
ing proper seating to meet the need of the Specific area. The
free kit is available from the Clarin Manufacturing Com-

pany, 4640 West Harrison Street. Chicago 60644.

0 SPLASH HIT. A fast-action, floating water game called
Scatter Ball is played with twelve plastic balls which are
in a net supported by a metal frame on four plastic floats.
The net is cocked, and a quick jerk on the “trigger” releases
heavy rubber strips which throw the net upward, causing

the dozen red and white plastic-foam balls to be scattered
in unexpected directions.

Teams of almost any number then attempt to retrieve
their set of six balls faster than the opposition. The game
may also be played by individuals who compete against the
clock. Scatter Ball is equally exciting in shallow or deep

 

water, and may be used in pools, lakes, or rivers. On a cool
day or when the young non-swimmers want their turn, the
game may also be played on the lawn.

The metal parts of the new game are plated or made of
aluminum to resist rust. The plastic floats are made of buoy-
ant, flexible Ethafoam polyethylene foam. The balls are
made by expanding polystyrene Pelaspan beads.

For further information, write to the F ormex Corpora-
tion, Elkhart, Indiana.

0 KNOCKDOWN POOLS. The Futura on-the-ground redwood
swimming pool, marketed for many years as a prefabricated
home pool, has been re-engineered and redesigned to meet
the special requirements of camps and playgrounds. The
safety-engineered, self~fenced pools with a heavy-duty vinyl
liner, come with either a three-and-a-half—foot constant water
level or a seven-and-a-half—foot plunge area. Outside dimen-
sions are 24’-by-4~8’, which includes a patio deck. Forty feet
of benching, which is part of the pool package, can be in-
stalled to meet the individual needs of the camp or play-
ground. N 0 mechanized excavation necessary. Pool can be
erected in two to three days. At season’s end, it can be
knocked down, moved, and reassembled. For further in-
formation, write to the International Swimming Pool Cor-
poration, 39 Powerhouse Road, Roslyn Heights, New York.

FILMS

While many recreation departments make
excellent use of the wealth of free or low-cost
films and filmstrips available, too many de-
partments fail to take advantage of this excel-
lent resource. They certainly could use the many
excellent films in many areas—to train person-
nel, volunteers, to teach participants crafts,
sports, conservation, et cetera. Films can round
out many club programs, be a special event all
on their own, fill out and add color to "thin"
spots.

The recent American Film Festival in New York
City, sponsOred by the Educotional Film Library
Association, provided excellent opportunity to
see many films that recreation departments
should consider. While the festival had a spe-
cific category for "sports, recreation, physical
education," actually "recreation" cut across
many of the other categories, such as "con-
“nature and wildlife," "Music,
Among the note-

 

servation,"
drama, dance," et cetera.

CREATIVE LEADERSHIP
IN RECREATION

By Howard G. Danford, COLORADO STATE COLLEGE

The following comments reflect the enthusiastic response this
newly published text has received.

"One Of the beSt books that I have ever seen on leadership."
Dr. Tillman Hall, University of S oath ern California

"The form and content Of this book is logical and exceptional. It starts with the role of
leisure in our society and then moves into Understanding Human Behavior both of which
are essential to the development of goals and objectives . . . Dr. Danford has done a crea-
tive and Stimulating effort in this book with numerous illustrations and functional situ-
ations that aid the reader in understanding the main concepts of the book. I heartily en-
dorse this book for college and university classes in Leadership in Recreation.”

Dr. Harry D. Edgren, Purdue University

"Excellent in content. Superior to any work produced thus far. Should be a must for
all professional people."

Dr. C. M. Flory, Tarleton State College

"We are particularly pleased to see the chapter on 'Human Behavior'. It adds the missing
dimension. In fact the entire presentation begins to provide an approach in texr material
for graduate education in this field. Perhaps this is due to the inclusion Of material that
views Recreation Leadership as a profession related to the current sociO-economic life of

the United States.”
Elliott M. Avedon, Teachers College, C olmnbia University

"This is the most up-tO-date material that has been written in the field. A most outsrand-
mg text by one of the top men in the profession."

Dr. Neal C. Tremble, University of Denver

"The chapter ‘Undetstanding Human Behavior provides the reader with the unique op-
portunity to find in one volume how the tools of the profession and methods of applica-
tion are determined by the uniqueness of the man he is serving. Dr. Danford has helped
immeasureably the profession and college instructors by putting into words the educa-
tional significance of recreation, and clearly defining the importance of leisure."

Dr. [ale B. Beaver, Central Missouri State College
"This is an exceptional book in that it does place emphasis on the educational signilicance

of recreation . . . Principles Of leadership and of program planning are well handled
throughout the book in addition to descriptions of successful techniques."

Professor Mildred B. Woblford, Washington State University

"This is a splendid book. I enjoyed reading it very much. It is a disrinct challenge to our
profession."

ice Project on Recreation for Arthritics.
The pilot group of fifteen cases are pres-
ently participating in a variety of on-
going recreation programs in Philadel-
phia. The programs are assigned on
the basis of medical limitations set by
the examining rheumatologists at the
referral clinics, the‘interests of the ar-
thritics, and the evaluation of the proj-
ect recreation staff.

Before referral of cases could begin,
the project staff had to develop with
the Philadelphia Recreation Depart-
ment a directory of recreation services
and facilities offered by the recreation
department, neighborhood centers,
YMCA’s, and adult education pro-
grams.

The pilot group of arthritic cases are
all adults, ranging in age from twenty
to seventy years of age. They 'suffer
from involvements of rheumatoid ar-
thritis in hands, hips, ankles, feet, lower
extremities, wrists, or shoulders. Two
of the patients are involved in swim-
ming programs at the YMCA and
YWCA. Others are participating in
crafts and cultural programs in city
recreation c e n t e r s neighborhood
houses, and golden-age clubs. These
cases will be evaluated medically every
three months and recreationally after
one month, six months, twelve months,
and eighteen months. The recreation
evaluations include program participa-
tion, social improvement, and emotional
improvement.

Transportation problems in a recrea-
tion referral program of this type can
present a major obstacle. The project
staff has deveIOped a volunteer driver
corps and a taxi voucher system at dis-
count prices for the arthritic partici-
pants.

Menly and James Laboratories. Ltd.
of Philadelphia, recently contributed
five hundred dollars to the project for
the deveIOpment of a visual-aid pro-
gram. This project is developing com-
munity awareness and interest in the
referral program and a practical meth-
od of guiding handicapped persons into
normal recreation programs in the com-
munity. Out of this project will also

come activity materials for specific ar-
thritic conditions as well as data con-
cerning the value of medically oriented
recreation for the physical, social and

emotional makeup of persons suffering
from arthritis and rheumatism.

+ Special service facilities for handi-
capped travelers will soon be available
at Garden State Parkway restaurants
and restrooms, according to the New
Jersey Parkway Authority as reported
in the New York World-Telegram and
Sun. Wheelchair access ramps have
been provided where needed, and hand-
rails to toilets installed at each parkway
restaurant-gasoline service area to ac-
commodate the elderly and disabled
travelers. Wheelchair patrons will be
accommodated at dining-room tables in
any restaurant upon request to the man-
ager at any time, even when the dining

room is closed and only counters are
open.

+ A series of resolutions concerned
with the role of labor in the develop-
ment and improvement of rehabilitative
services in the nation, in the states, and
in the local community, was adapted re-
cently by the AFL—CIO Executive Coun-
cil at a meeting in Florida. It is satis-
fying to note that one of the resolu-
tions states: “Identify the comprehen-
sive needs of individuals undergoing or
who have completed rehabilitation serv-
ices for social and recreational services
as well as for physical and vocational
help, and assist in mobilizing communi-
ty resources to meet such needs.”

+ Service awards were given recently
by Volunteer Service Photographers,
Inc. (111 West 57th Street, New York
10019) to 105 volunteers. These awards,
in the form of blue enamel pins, are
given annually to all Volunteer Service
Photographers who have been active in
one of the organization’s thirty—one re-
habilitation photography programs
throughout the New York-New Jersey
area during the previous year. During
a year, VSP volunteers contribute as
many as seventy-four hundred hours of
free photographic instruction in hospi-
tals, rehabilitation and community cen-
ters for the hospitalized and handi-
capped as well as for teenagers and sen-
ior citizens. In addition, the organiza-
tion equips and maintains photo labs in
the institutions it serves.

Recreation for the Physically Handi-
capped, Janet Pomeroy. Macmillan
Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York
1001]. Pp. 380, illustrated. $7.95.

FULL OF excellent material and illus-
trations, most attractively present-
ed, this much-needed book is concerned
with development and recreation pro-
grams for the physically handicapped
in a community setting. Primarily
based on the program conducted in the
Recreation Center for the Handicapped,
founded and directed by the author in
San Francisco, it shows how a com-
munity can begin a recreation program
for this group and offers suggestions for
dealing with the problems involved. A
book of this sort has been greatly need-
ed to increase the rather meager, but
growing, resource materials in this
important field.

The first half deals with philosophy,
objectives, and values of recreation for
the physically handicapped and is fol-
lowed with chapters on establishing a
program, organization, personnel, fa-
cilities and equipment needed, financ-
ing, and public relations. The policies
and procedures recorded, though lim-
ited to experience in one center, have
all been successful in practical appli-
cation in that center.

The activity section of the book con-
tains approximately two hundred pages
of program information adaptable for
various physical disabilities. The faces
in the photographs show an aliveness
and a joy which tell their own story.
Emphasis is placed upon the desirabil-
ity of integrating the activities of the
handicapped with those of the non-
handicapped wherever possible.

This book should be of great help to
community recreation leaders who ac-
cept the responsibility of bringing rec-
reation to this very needy group and
are looking for some guidance in this

field.-——Morton Thompson, Ed.D., Na-

THIS PAPERBACK combines game in-
structions with construction plans
and drawings of the physical layout for
many games. It will be helpful to many

SEPTEMBER, 1964

leaders to have such material under one
cover. It will be especially helpful in
teaching those games that require spe-
cial instruction and are often not in-
cluded in game books, such as billiards,
sacket, tetherball, paddle tennis, cro-
quet, and many other informal recre-
ation sports. Game and court layouts
are drawn clearly and explanations are
simple.

Part II includes board games, puz-
zles, and tricks, and what the authors
call “active skill games,” but which are
what are usually thought of as impro-
vised equipment games. These include
various beanbag tossing games; games
using tin cans; various tossing games,
such as flipping cards into a basket;
blowing games, ball-bouncing games,
dropping small articles into a bottle,
et cetera, games often used in informal
carnivals, or for rainy day and indoor
contests.

The board games and puzzles include
(with permission) many of the inter-
esting games developed by the Coop-
erative Recreation Service in the 30’s,

such as Adi, Ruma, and other favorites

in Handy I and Handy 11. Some have
appeared in NRA’S Make Your Own
Puzzles and Make Your Own Games.

The third section of the book in-
cludes instructions for special activities
such as jacks, marbles, Tita Toria
(Lummey Sticks), rope jumping, and
others. This section will be particularly
helpful since NRA’s 88 Successful Play
Activities is out of print.

The book’s size — 81/2” - by - 11” —
makes it a bit difficult to handle. It is
too tall for the average bookshelf and
too thick for average files. The best

Teacher’s Handbook of Indoor and
Outdoor Games, Harry D. Edgren and
Joseph J. Gruber. Prentice-Hall, En-
glewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Pp. 224,
illustrated. $5.95.

TWO EDUCATORS have come up with
an excellent idea—a spiralbound,
attractive gamebook observing recrea-
tion objectives, but geared specially to
play periods, whether indoor or out-
door, of school children. Their philos-
ophy is simple and specific: “This per-
iod should be thought of as a laboratory
where the pupils unveil their game skill,
their degree of social integration, their
value systems, and their emotional ad-
justments to themselves and others. In-
deed, to the teacher, this should be more
than a ‘supervised play period’ or ‘re-
cess time.’ This period must be con-
sidered as an educational experience for
both the teacher and student.”

The games are classified sensibly, not
by age but by types, and range from
inactive, classroom games to active
games for large outdoor areas, sports
lead-up games, holiday games, and
party games. No reference is made to
the illustrator, but the white figures sil-
houetted on a black background show
ing some of the game formations are
not only amusing but striking.

The introduction of the book is good,
but too short, and the same can be said
about the chapter on game leadership.
Another chapter, or expansion of these,
could have been used to explain more
fully the value of play, how large a part
it can have in motivation of classroom
interest, how it can accentuate and add
to the learning process, and what it can
mean to teacher-pupil relationships. The
teachers of Tippecanoe County who
contributed to this book probably know
all this. Other instructors, in other
schools, however, may not be convinced
——-indeed, may be very bored with the
idea of game activities and regard them
merely as extra chores in a heavy teach-
ing schedule. Professors Edgren and
Gruber might have exerted more in-
fluence where it may be needed if they
had gone one step forward.

This is a very good selection, and its
title should not limit its sales to teach-
ers. It belongs in any recreation library
-—-—indeed, it would be excellent for play-
ground leaders.

Better Plays for Today's Churches,
selected by John W. Bachman and E.
Martin Browne. Association Press, 291
Broadway, New York 10007. Pp. 474.
$8.95.

In this collection there are no “Bibli-
cal pageants with their bathrobe ba-
thos,” and no medieval mystery plays,
so readily available. Here are plays in
a modern idiom, written to explore the
roots of faith, but in terms of today’s
world. These twelve plays are grouped
loosely under the headings of “Modern
Society,” “The Passion Events,” “Christ-
mas Plays,” and “Old Testament
Themes.” Casts range in number from
“two men and a voice” to twenty-four
characters, and running time varies
from a breathless ten minutes for A
Very Cold Night to an hour and a half
for Verdict of One and Eyes Upon the
Cross. Three of the plays were written
specifically for production in a particu-
lar church. The C urate’s Play, commis-
sioned for the 150th anniversary of St.
George’s Episcopal Church in New York
City, is a delightful example.

Emmanuel, a charming Christmas
play, has been performed on stage and
on television; A Very Cold Night won
a first prize in a playwriting competi-
tion sponsored by the Union Theologi-
cal Seminary. It takes only ten minutes
running time, but it is unforgettable.
The Case Against Eve is a modern fan-
tasy, with a degree of humor usually
missing in church productions. The
Circle Beyond Fear is a moving and in-
tricate interweaving of human emo-
tions, first written for choral speaking,
but not limited to that form. Christ in
the Concrete City is undoubtedly the
best known, having been produced in
many seminaries, on TV, and the many
local groups. It is essentially a modern
Passion Play.

This collection, then, is far above and
beyond the usual moralistic and often
banal plays often selected by church
groups. The plays have the quality that
permits them to meet the increasing in-
terest of the church in religious drama.
They demand work, effort, and skill on
the part of the cast; but what a reward
they are!

While this collection provides read-
ing, not acting versions, in each case
the sources of acting versions are given.
Royalties are remarkably small for such
excellent drama.

It should be pointed out that these
plays need not be limited solely to
church production — nor have they
been. It should also be pointed out that
this book is good reading for the many
who enjoy drama as literature. This is

Adults, Lora lee Parrott. Zondervan

illustrated. $3.95.

WRITTEN by the wife of the pastor
of the First Church of the Naz-

arene in Portland, Oregon, who has also

written a good cookbook, Meals From
the Manse Cookbook, this book contains

a wide variety of ideas for parties, ban-
quets, showers and other occasions. Its
parties and other social events all in-
clude suggestions for a devotional at
the end.

Most of the plans would need addi-
tional material if they were to be used
for a full-length social program, but a
program committee could get off to a
good start. The book contains sections
on themes for parties and for showers,

and a section of recipes for party re-
freshments.

Styles for Dolls, lucy Cunningham
and Beth Herbst. Calico Print Shop,

Kansas. Pp. 48, illustrated. Spiral-
bound, $3.50.

DOLL COLLECTORS, costume design-
ers, collectors of period fashions,
students of yesterday, producers of his-
torical pageants, attention! This
charming book is quaintly reminiscent
of those days when paper dolls were cut
from fashion books, ladies wore wasp
waists, bustles, and trains, and when
the wardrobes of dolls consisted of fine
workmanship, tiny tucks, exquisite
frills. The book is made up of actual

styles, entirely designed for dolls in
what has been called “The Golden Age

of Dolls,” from 1879 through 1892.
These appeared in the old Delineator’s
“Styles for Dolls,” and the original
pages of that magazine are reproduced
here. There is, for instance, the “girl-
dolls’ walking costume,” the “gentle-
man dolls’ dress suit,” “the lady dolls’
reception toilette,” “a girl-dolls’ house
costume,” and so on.

These pages were acquired through
years of exciting “treasure hunting”
and slow collecting—often a page at a
time. The original style plates are in-
cluded. The text which accompanies
them is also the original—old-fashioned
now, gently amusing, and very detailed.
It makes for delightful reading. This
book is not for children but for grown-
ups, youngsters and collectors of all
ages. '

Here is an exceptional intermediate
target rifle by Anschutz, famed builders
of the smallbore rifles used in inter-
national matches by more competitors
and by more of the winners—than all
other makes combined.

The Model 64 has many special fea-
tures that add up to X-ring accuracy:
a satin smooth single-shot action;
trigger adjustable for pull, creep and
backlash; a precision rifled and hand-
lapped medium-heavy barrel. Target
stock has raised cheek-piece, deeply
fluted comb, checkered contour pistol
grip. Beavertail fore-end has long rail
with instantly adjustable sliding
swivel; adjustable rubber butt plate.

The Model 64 target rifle costs only
$75.00. (Sights extra) Left-hand stock
slightly more. Price subject to change.

A Great NEW Sport
with Many New Benefits

ONLY PENNIES

COSOM INDOOR-OUTDOOR HOCKEY

effectively combines physical education
with fun! It is a contest with the action,
excitement and competition young
people love. It provides roughly “twice
the action of basketball,” with the varied
running that builds strong bodies. Those
who do not qualify for “varsity” sports
play Cosom Hockey with skill and enfoy-
ment. Yet it tests the stamina of the
“varsity” athlete.

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   

Cosom Hockey gives the phy. ed. in-
structor or the recreational instructor
the means to arouse the enthusiastic
participation that makes his efforts so
much more resultful.

GIRLS ALSO ENJOY COSOM HOCKEY

Anna Barker, Phy. Ed. instructor for girls at N. W. Junior
High of Battle Creek, Michigan, says Cosom Hockey is “one
of the most stimulating and vigorous activities. Students have
shown much enthusiasm.” No protective equipment needed!
Plastic sticks and pucks (or balls for play on grass or hard
surfaces outdoors) are amazingly durable. Less than $35
equips 2 teams.
