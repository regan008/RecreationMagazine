Victims of mental retardation...

can almost always be helped

The mentally retarded should be...
cared for in institutions

helped to live usefully

 

If you fail this quiz,
it might be one of the best thing
that ever happened to you.

If you failed to check the last bracket under each
statement above, you flunked. That’s good? Sure, be-
cause you’ve already begun to realize that: (1) men-
tal retardation is a tremendous national problem,
(2) its victims can be helped; and (3) they can live
and work in their own communities.

If you have come this far, it might be one of the
best things that ever happened to the retarded, too.
Because you may be the kind of person willing to do
your part in their behalf.

Here are six things you can do now to help
prevent mental retardation and bring new
hope to those Whose minds are retarded:

I. If you expect a baby, stay under a doctor’s or a
hospital’s care. Urge all expectant mothers to do so.

2. Visit local schools and urge them to provide special
teachers and special classes to identify and help men-
tally retarded children early in their lives.

3. Urge your community to set up workshops to train
retardates Who are capable of employment.

4. Select jobs in your company that the mentally re-
tarded can fill, and hire them.

5. Accept the mentally retarded as American citizens.
Give them a chance to live useful, dignified lives in
your community.

54 RECREA

n ’ITERS

'. I'd-Activity Programs

any hospitals for the ill and/or
icapped and schools for the men-
' retarded, both private and public,
ate the recreation responsibilities
ersons whose primary job is the
of those individuals. The pro-
us are often called “ward-activity
rains” or some other term that de-
s recreation for the participants.
1 programs are, in many cases, mis-
ing because they often afford little
ny recreation for the participants.
often, recreation is conceived of
activity only, and, consequently,
n chillren are seen engaging in ac-
y it is called “recreation.”

o the professional recreator, activity
e, though a prerequisite, is not ne-
arily recreation. It is how this ac-
y is engaged in and the motive for
ging in this activity that makes it
eation. \Vas the activity sought
/or accepted or was it superim-
d on the individuals? Were they
ced into partaking? If so, it can
a ly be expected for activity engaged
nder such conditions to allow indi-
als the opportunity for self-expres-
, creativity, adventure, and all the
r human values that are inherent
true recreation.”

elow are some of the many reasons
' a ward-activity type program
uld not be the primary source of
eation for an individual or group
ndividuals: The primary work of
d personnel, and rightfully so, deals
1 tending to the basic needs of those
, eir care; that is, seeing that each in-
'dual is properly clothed, fed, et
ra. This leaves recreation as a sec-
ary role; in the case of many, a
or role. This should not be. Rec-
ion is of sufficient importance to
ify it being left to those who con-
r it their primary responsibility.

 

Ward personnel tend to carry over
ward discipline and methods into the
recreation program. This tendency dis-
courages wholesome acting-out and
regiments participation. The fact that
a person is good on the wards is not in
itself evidence that he will be a good
recreation leader. In fact, just the op-
posite is quite possible. A different form
of leadership and control from that us-
ually found on the wards is needed to
encourage participation in recreation
activities.

The unfavorable psychological atti-
tudes that many of the participants have
towards the buildings that they must
call their homes make the use of these
buildings for recreation purposes far
from acceptable and could in many
cases stymie wholesome participation.

There is definitely a place for ward-

activity or similar type programs. It
is not meant to be suggested from the

above that such programs should not
exist. These programs should be used,
but only as a compliment or a stimuli or
an adjunct to a comprehensive recrea-
tion program administered by persons
with recreation as their primary respon-
sibility and never as a substitute for
such.

Philosophical Foundations
Sirs: _ _

l was pleased to see a review of my
book Philosophical Foundations for
Physical, Health, and Recreation Edu-
cation in [your] January issue, but I
am forced to the conclusion that Dr.
Kraus has criticized my work for not
doing something which was never plan-
ned in the first place. As I explained
in several places in the book, “Physical,
Health, and Recreation Education” is
one conception of the role of the physi-
cal educator in our schools. The physi-
cal educator is responsible for physical
recreation within this framework.

I did not promise the reader that I

one in recreation could do this. The
diiiiculty lies in the fact that recreation
must produce its own scholars with the
background in philosophy and philoso-
phy of education to undertake this task.

Dr. Kraus takes me to task also for
“the book’s lack of a thorough and
systematic attempt to develop a philoso-
phy of leisure and recreation.” Partic-
ular philosophies of leisure and recre-
ation have been written very ably by
Nash, Brightbill, Danford, and others.
But these philosophies belong to these
men; there is no such “animal” as one
philosophy of leisure and recreation
which could have been offered in a
book of this type. Its purpose was to
offer some of the implications for phys-
ical, health, and recreation education
from the leading philosophical tenden-
cies in the Western World.

To answer Dr. Kraus, “recreation
education” is “education for recrea-
tion.” Itocertainly is not professional
preparation for recreational leadership.
The former relates to general educa-
tion; the latter is, of course, profes-
sional in nature.

I thank you and Dr. Kraus again for
this review. I hope I have cleared up
some of the misunderstandings.

of Trustees chaired by James H. Evans, on January 22, 1965, the
thirty board members attending unanimously passed the following
resolution for merger of the National Recreation Association, Ameri-
can Recreation Society, American Institute of Park Executives and
the National Conference of State Parks:

THAT the Pr0posal for Merger dated December 5, 1964,
be approved and that the Special Committee of the Board
(consisting of James H. Evans, Susan M. Lee, Luther Culick,
and Robert W. Crawford) be authorized and directed to
work out with the Board representatives of the other or-
ganizations the details of the merger to be submitted for the
consideration of the Board at its next meeting on May 26,

1965.

CLARENCE BREWER
1891-1964-

Clarence Brewer, who retired in
961 after fifty years of dedicated
vice in the recreation field, most
'i them on the staff of the Nation-
] Recreation Association, died on
hristnias day of a heart attack. Mr.
rewer had been caring for his wife
he has not been well during these
t years. From the days of the

.' ’ar Camp Community Service dur-

ng World War I, through field serv-
e during World \Var II, he had
iven his loyal support, fine knowl-
r. and skill to the work of the
_ ociation, serving largely in the
aid department.
At the time of his retirement, he
rad been a member of the National
ommittee for Amateur Baseball, a
. t-president of the Amateur Base-
. ll Federation, and for thirty years
member of the International Joint
ules Committee on Softball. He
(l served, too, as a consultant on
dustrial recreation for the NRA
uring those years and was widely
own and loved in manufacturing
ircles. His community surveys and

   
    
  
  

UARY, 1965

studies for the Association had
taken him far afield, and he had

likewise become a familiar figure to
many recreators and community
groups from coast to coast.

After his retirement, he continued
to serve on the International Joint
Rules Committee on Softball, the
National Committee for Baseball,
and on the board of directors of the

Recreation Association of Michigan.
He also continued to make commu-
nity recreation studies for the NRA
and to work with Dr. Frank L. Ok-
tavec, head of the recreation curric-
ulum at Wayne State College, De-
troit, on board member workshops.
He was living in Detroit at the time
of his death.

Friends from far and near have
been wiring and writing the NRA
to express their sorrow and they
have been generous in their praise
of his ability and dedication, and of
the part he played in developing the
recreation field. He will be greatly
missed.

tion director in Maricopa County, Ari-
zona, who is credited with developing
the nation’s largest locally operated
regional parks system. Mr. Smithee
plans to report to NRA’s Washington
headquarters on February 10 to begin
his newly created job. He will serve
as special consultant on parks and rec-
reation to counties throughout the fifty
states. As director of the Marieopa
County department, Mr. Smithee de-
veloped the county regional parks sys-
tem from a tiny operation into a 93,-
OOO-acre regional and sub-regional
program comprising eleven parks. He
also developed and was instrumental in
the transfer to various cities in the
county of seventeen urban parks con-
taining a total of 750 acres, and with
improvements valued at $1,300,000.
His successor in Maricopa County is
Eddie Brown, superintendent of parks
for the county since 1962.

) URBAN moments. The National As-
sociation of Counties recently issued a
“white paper” calling for a three-
pronged attack on urban problems
which would include a \Vhite House

Office on Urban Affairs, headed by a

special assistant to the President. a
cabinet-level Department of Housing,
and a Council of Urban Affairs. The
proposals were announced by NACO
President Edwin G. Michaelian. the
elected executive of Westchester Coun-
ty, New York, and are a reaffirmation
of NACO policy.

The NACO position paper, noted
that “Every American, regardless of
where he lives, is deeply involved in
urbanization and urban affairs. It also
becomes evident that urbanization is

so far-reaching in every aspect that it

57

directly affects every aspect of gov-
ernment and inter-governmental activ-
ity, federal, state, and local.” NACO
reiterated that the urban problem is
not a mythical conflict between urban
and rural areas, but is in fact a phe-
nomenon based on population move-
ment with two sets of problems: one
in the areas of out-migration and one
in the area of in-migration.

} THE STAMP 0F GULICK. Representa-
tives of several national agencies are
spearheading a drive to have a United
States postage stamp issued in com-
memoration of Dr. Luther Halsey Gu-
lick. It is hoped that the stamp can
be issued December 5, 1965—the hun-
dredth anniversary of his birth. Dr.
Gulick was one of the founders and the
first President of the National Recrea-
tion Association (formerly called the
Playground Association of America).
He also helped to organize the Boy
Scouts of America, the Camp Fire
Girls and the Folk Dance Society of
America, as well as to modernize the
YMCA’s program. You can take part
in this effort to honor Dr. Gulick.
Write to your senators and congress-
men. Ask for their support of this
commemorative postage stamp for is-
suance on December 5, 1965. You can

also write directly to Postmaster John
A. Gronouski, Washington, DC. 20025.

THE NATIONAL RECREATION ASSOCIATION AND RESEARCH

0 HELP THE NRA to better service
the recreation movement and the
professionals and agencies involved, a
constituency survey has been sent NRA
Affiliates and Associates. In the case of
merger, this will provide excellent in-
formation on which to base the services
aspect of the new organization. The
survey has two parts:

Part 1 Characteristics of the constitu-
ency which include things such as the
setting in which they work, the service
area, nature of position; personal data,
such as age, education, and other
things.

Part 2 An evaluation of services both
of present and of recommended serv-
Ices.

Since its organization in 1906, the
NRA has considered studies and re-
search one of its most important func-
tions. To date, this research has cen-
tered in field studies, inventories, and
special inquiries. Field studies have
been primarily of two types: compre-
hensive and nation-wide studies involv-
ing field observations and Visitation,
and studies restricted to a single local-
ity or a few cities. Publications result-
ing from early studies of the first type
are Park Manual, Music in American

the organization and administration of
cultural recreation programs, based on
data gathered from administrators of
such programs in all parts of the coun-
try. In the second type, NRA’s many
individual city and country surveys are
well known.

Need for information on specific
problems or procedures has led NRA
to make special inquiries, many by
questionnaire and committee study,
into such subjects as the use of school
buildings by recreation departments,
systems for taking playground attend-
ance, personnel standards, surfacing
methods and materials, play space and
apparatus standards, encroachment,
recreation services to clients of rep-
resentative types of sheltered work-
shops, ways of meeting some social-
psychological needs of home-bound

of leisure, recreation, on the acceptance
level with work, education, health, wel-
fare, and religion. Let us recognize
recreation’s potentials for good and
banish our traditional feelings of guilt
towards recreation participation. Let
us become overtly aware that, in recre-
ation use of leisure, we can realize the
opportunities for which man has sought
throughout the centuries. We must
create a philosophy of recreation use
of leisure worthy of these potentials.
Then, because of the freedom and di-
rection which this philosophy of leisure
gives to us, we can realize its full op-
portunities for creative, satisfying, rec-
reative living.

If we accept the obvious—that in
this era of leisure we need a philosophy
in regard to its use—it becomes neces-
sary to agree on the steps to take in
getting a leisure philosophy which rec-
ognizes the needs of our people and
which suggests directions in which to
proceed in satisfying these needs. This
reveals a process that is more specific
and more generally understood than
that which is involved in the formation
of a philosophy.

This process is called planning, plan-
ning as it is understood by the recre-
ator and the professional planner. Out
of good planning comes data as to the
needs and wishes of people, of re-
sources which are available or which
can be brought to bear, or created, for
the satisfaction of needs. A good plan
must be based upon intelligently re-
lated facts.

Planning establishes attainable goals.
focuses a people’s intent and directs
their combined, intelligent efforts into
logical, experience-based coordinated
effort to progress towards the realiza-
tion of selected goals. It makes pur-
posive action possible to a community.
a state, and a nation, action which is
much more intelligently directed than
the trial-and-error method of the para-
mecium, or of community-by-connnu-
nity trial-and-error. lt pyramids ex-
perience and works from a solid base
of facts and of proven method.

Planning brings together experience

EDITORtAL

and knowledge as to masses of (-aUsa-
tivc factors and related effects. of in-
telligently selected goals to firmed and
overtly expressed community purpom,
and the resulting direction which is
given to joined human effort to move
towards goals. These are facts which
the lay citizen will comprehend.

These facts have become, through
planning skills, a reasoned science
which, per se, can become the base
and the beginning of a philosophy of
leisure for our day. It can be a phi-
losophy based upon the facts of the
leisure needs of a people, and will make
it a uniquely fitting one for this coun-
try, and for its recreative use of leisure.

Thus, in the creation of important
phases of our philosophy for the use
of leisure, we find a practical, immedi-
ate, realistic approach to the taking of
our first step. It is for the recreator,
the professional planner and the lay,
local, state and national community
leadership to join in recreation plan-
ning and to do it as a reasoned science.
This, by acretion, can become our
country’s own philosophy of leisure.
and of its recreative use.

The combined thinking. experience
and effort of the recreator, the planner
and the lay community will, also. help
to gain more general understanding
and acceptance, by the individual. that
recreation is important to him, that it
can be made available and that he can
participate in its benefits without apol-
ogy to his “work only” ancestors, or
their backward-looking descendants. It
will help him to recognize the fact that
the age of leisure is one of opportunity
only if this disposable time. energy and
money is used up with desirable and
satisfying cultural. creative, physical.
mental. social and emotional experi-
ences . . . which. combined. are planned
recreation.

Thus. planning can form the base
for a philosophy of leisure which will
be fitted to our day. to our people and
which helps to relate causative factors
in a way that are contributive to finer
economic and societal effects. which are
our future. #

parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.
A mistaken belief about modern in-
struments is that they never change.
One radical departure is a completely
new fingering system for the saxo-
phone, the first major change in over
a hundred years. It took Leblanc of
Paris thirty-five years to accomplish
this. Another radical departure in
modern wind instruments is a trumpet
which has an up-tilted bell to direct the
sound over the heads of other players.
Speaking of drums, it is this instru-
ment that has been used in supersti-
tious rites for centuries throughout the
world. Chaco Indians use it to speed
the ripening of beans. In southwestern
Asia, drums are beaten for the funerals
of men only. Among certain primitive
peoples, a drum’s usefulness is over if
a woman sees it being constructed and
the Wallinda of East Africa believe
that a man courts death if he so much
as looks at a drum! Haitian voodoo
drums are built according to an elabo-

like christening garments, named, and
given a soul! As an offering to this
spirit, they are rubbed with alcohol
and flour before every ceremony.

THERE ARE BIG scnmusas, too, in
the history of many a pOpular in-
strument. Few Scotsmen know that
their beloved bagpipes came originally
from the Orient, and were played by
Roman soldiers when they conquered
ancient Britain! And did you know
that the organ is technically classified
as a wind instrument? Or that it
originated as far back as 300 BC?

If you don’t object to going to ex-
tremes, and want to become a pro-
ficient musician, take your chosen in-
strument to a crossroads at midnight.
There, according to folklore, the devil
—an expert musician—will teach you
his virtuoso techniques, at the minor
price of your soul. So strong was this
folk belief that violin genius Nicola
Paganini was actually accused of a
pact with Lucifer!

That is not the only superstition cur-
rent in musical circles around the
world. Flutes are widely regarded as
having regenerative powers. The Toda
tribe of India, which does not make or
play flutes, buries its dead with flutes
bought from other tribes, so that the
deceased will have a chance to be re-
born. The lowly hamo, obtainable in

TOO MUCH
SNOW

N Boothia, a frozen Canadian
0 Arctic peninsula some twelve
hundred miles from the North

Pole, one'might expect the most popu-
lar forms of recreation to be ice fishing
and dogsled racing. However, the Es-
kimo children enj 0y*a varied sports and
fitness program, thanks to a Royal Ca-
nadian Mountie and a Catholic priest.
Boothia was named for Sir Felix
Booth, president of Booth’s Cins of
London, who in 1829 financed the ex-
pedition that discovered the peninsula.
Recently, Booth’s decided to construct
a recreation hall at Spence Bay, the
peninsula’s only settlement, to com-

memorate the 135th anniversary of its
naming.

 

There’s plenty of. snow in Boothia—
too much for skiing. The lake is frozen
over, but is also too snowy for ice
skating, and other outdoor competitive
sports are ruled out by the Arctic
weather most of the year. Until re-
cently, Boothian children had confined
their athletics to recess hour in the
primitive playgrounds behind the one-
room schoolhouse, but their excellent
coordination and natural dexterity was
noticed by Dick Vitt, the Royal Ca-
nadian Mounted Police officer assigned
to Boothia. He set up a “gym” in a
corner of the schoolroom and invited
the children to learn tumbling and
stunts.

“Helping-hand projects

Venezuelan youngsters

“They caught on so fast,” said Dick,
“that in just a few weeks they were
organizing meets among themselves
and to impress their parents with their
new-found prowess.” The children en-
joy performing as much as their audi-
ence enjoys watching. With Dick em-
ceeing, and occasionally shouting a
word of instruction to his “acrobats,”
the children go through an hour of
tumbling, handstands, individual cal-
isthenics, and complex group pyramids
twice a week.

Dick’s only disappointment, and the
children’s as well, is that they cannot
participate in competition with other
Arctic settlements, because of transpor-
tation difiiculties. The children and
their instructor were elated at the news
of the construction of a recreation hall.
Dick hopes to set aside a large area for
permanent mats, parallel bars, basket-
ball hoops, and other athletic equip-
ment.

Though tumbling classes have be-
come the backbone of the physical-
education program, disciplined outdoor
activity is also encouraged. In that
part of the Arctic one of the children’s
favorite exercises is ski walking. Under
the direction of Father Louis Lerner,
a Catholic priest, the class walks a mile
trail once a week. In this manner. he
explains, they build up not only their
leg muscles but endurance and disci-
pline as well. Even the girls, who shy
away from gymnastics, are not to be
outdone by their brothers in ski walk-
ing.

Dick was quite enthusiastic about the
value of physical education to these
Eskimo children. “Any time one of
these kids wants to trade his parka
for a sweat shirt, we’ll be happy to
accommodate him,” he said. “They are
such natural athletes, that any one of
them, with the proper training. could
become an Olympic I star. Athletic

WINTER SPORTS:

JAM CANS AND T-BARS

 

JAM CAN
CURLING

 

Charles A. Barbour, Director of Rec-
reation, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

AM CAN CURLING is a major sport in

Metropolitan Winnipeg. Just ask
any of the ten thousand boys and girls
who curl the game as part of the school
and recreation program. All-day tour-
naments called bonspiels often draw as
many as a thousand boys and girls.
Here, the youngsters are divided into
age groups, mixed groups, et cetera.
Trophies are donated for the winners
in the classifications. It is quite often
that the girls are victorious over the
boys. Although jam canners have lim-
ited the lengths of their rinks to sixty
feet (see diagram), the rules followed
are basically the same as those set out
by the Dominion of Canada Curling
Association.

The “roaring game” of curling, al-
ways popular in Canada and now ex-
periencing a surge of popularity in the
United States, need not be confined to
spacious curling arenas. This has been
proven by school and recreation per-

sonnel who build their rinks out of
doors on the school and recreation
grounds. A bit of time, labor, and en-
thusiasm will provide the facilities for
curling. What you can’t duplicate, you
can improvise.

The same goes for equipment. Curl-
ing “rocks” can be made from four-
pound jam cans filled with cement to
about an inch from the top. If concrete

with ice but this has a tendency to
bulge the bottom of the can and the
rocks do not run smoothly. The large
end of a baseball bat is used to round
out the bottom of the can.

Wooden rocks are used in many
places. These are pieces of stove wood
six to ten inches in diameter and three
to five inches in height. These should
be wrapped with stove wire to prevent
splitting. A bent spike or bolt inserted
in the top is used as a handle (see dia-
gram). The bottom rim of the can
should be slightly rounded with a
plane.

With thirty-six years service at this

Just prior to World War II, the
Duluth Ski Club with the help of gov-
ernment organizations established the
famous Fond du Lac ski site situated
amidst the picturesque rolling hills far
to the west of the city. It was here in
1941 that famous Norwegian-born
American Torger Tokle set a new bill
record for Duluth at 203 feet. Many
dramatic ski jumping meets have fol-
lowed that first historic event as each
year the Duluth Ski Club. city recrea-
tion department, and park department
combine efforts to stage their annual
shows.

Located near the Fond du Lac area
in the outlying community called Gary
is found a newly Constructed junior
ski jumping site. Built and operated bv
the people in Cary. this jump has de-
veloped many young boys who have

and Midwest tournaments. Newest of
all ski centers is the Lakevicw Ski and

skirts of the city. Also built by do-
nated labor and materials. this recrea-

PROBABLY no single element has con-
tributed so much to the advance
and enjoyment of skiing as the advent
of the ski tow. Duluth first operated
a tow in 1949 on its Fond du Lac
hills and on a slope formerly known
as Rock Hill (presently used for skiing
by the Duluth Branch of the Univero
sity of Minnesota). Since then. many
thousands of local winter enthusiasts

in a program such as the French
one there is always the danger that
policies will be dictated and that youth
will be “conquered.” This is happily
not the case in France. The Sports
programs have been

formulated with the voluntary cooper-

for vacations

ation of the civilian sporting organiza-
tions in each particular sport. There
is a High Committee of Youth and
Sports with representatives of the civ-
ilian organizations serving with gov-
ernment officials. The committee con-
ceives and proposes policy but does
not execute. It coordinates youth and
sport affairs between the different
ministries and maintains close liaison
with the various civilian organizations
in order to put forward their views.

For the vacation sports the secretar-
iat in general makes provision for the
training of leaders, gives funds for the
instruction and training of young peo-
ple, and supplies sports equipment and
facilities. The main focus is on the
rugged outdoor sports which produce
strong bodies and sound minds. There
is a National School of Skiing and
Mountain Climbing at Chamonix. The
school trains ski instructors and moun-
tain guides and issues certificates. The
secretariat, in cooperation with the
French Federation of Skiing, has or-
ganized classes for ski instruction in
the mountain regions of France (the
Jura, the Alps, the Massif Central. and
the Pyrenees). grants

For sailing, a number of “centers
of initiation" have been established.
Here, groups of young people are
formed, leaders are provided, boats
and facilities furnished, and training
takes place. Given this impetus, hun-
dreds and thousands of youth have
taken to sailing. After their initial
training they go on to form clubs, to
join existing clubs. and to enjoy the
sport for years afterwards.

Canoeing has experienced a similar
rise in popularity. This is a thrilling
sport. particularly when negotiating
stretches of rapids. Only a few years
ago canoeing was on the decline. Club
memberships were dwindling and the
manufacture of boats was curtailed.
Now. the trend has changed. Several
centers of initiation were created at
different locations throughout France.
These facilitated the training of canoe-
ists and also aided in the formation of
clubs. Now. hundreds of new canoe
enthusiasts are enjoying this sport in

out paintings worthy of admiration. Housewives and

’ ident Eisenhower, one of the world’s best-known “Sun-
painters,” once wrote that he considered his work to be
of a “rank amateur.” The first painting he ever made
‘ portrait of Mrs. Eisenhower—was so lacking in perspec-
that a two-inch hairbow appeared twelve inches long.
Winston Churchill, another famous amateur, became so
‘ ossed in his canvas that he fell off a camel while trying

Tilt-IRE COMES THE MOMENT at last when you sit before
your white, unblemished canvas. To place the first mark
upon it takes a certain kind of courage. Don’t hesitate. Be
bold. Plunge right in, and outline your chosen composition
with charcoal or pencil; don’t worry too much about detail,
or about your skill at drawing.

Pick simple subjects when you first begin to paint. Still
lifes, landscapes, and other outdoor themes are generally
easier for beginners than portraits which take some art
training and practice to do well.

Don’t “crowd” your canvas. A simple landscape with a
large object such as a house or a tree in the foreground or
middle ground, together with a stream or rail fence to lead
the eye across the picture to the center of interest. can be
more successful than a painting packed with details and a
multitude of colors.

Spray your charcoal sketch with Tuflilm to prevent it
from muddying your oil colors. The sequence of painting the
various areas is important. Start with the sky, then the
basic color for the large masses. When these are completed.
start on the shadow areas. After the shadow areas, do the
middle-tones and then the light areas. lt might be necessary
to work back and forth in some areas to maintain the ratio
of light to dark and to darken or lighten previously painted
shadows. You can reduce this problem materially by not
concentrating on small sections, but painting all over the
canvas.

Churchill remarked that “painting is like fighting a battle,
with the painter functioning as commander-in-chief." But
Churchill’s paintings in time became so good that art critics
have paid him considerable homage. Both General Eisen-
hower and Churchill have received great enjoyment and
satisfaction from painting. You. too, will find untold pleas-
ures in this exciting hobby.

HE LIST or INJUSTICES is endless. Too often we per-
petuate these injustices and contribute to dependency
out being aware of what we’re doing. In recreation,
tend to focus concern on “now,” the immediate situa-
, offering spontaneous, momentary satisfaction through
ve participation in a wide variety of activities. This is
t should be. To assure disabled persons of opportuni-
for this kind of experience, it is important to plan and
nize our services in relation to a specific goal, the
lopment of each disabled person’s potential for social
- )endence. Nevertheless, programs of recreation service
ld focus on long-range objectives, while using specific
vities to help each participant achieve immediate satis-
ion. To do this, the community’s recreation agencies
t be involved in coordinating a continuum of recreation
ices for disabled persons.
ecreation agencies must take their share of responsi-
y for providing service to all the residents of any given
munity—including the disabled. This extension of
he recreation service to include the disabled should be
gned to augment and sometimes replace special recre-
n services offered by private groups concerned with the
ls of persons with various disabilities. No single com-
tity agency, public or private, can provide all the types
ecreation service needed by disabled persons. In work-
with disabled persons, a variety of resources are re-
ed to provide a continuum of services to meet the
ging needs of the individual, not only as he makes
ress toward increased social and interpersonal devel-
vent; but in accord with irreversible physical, mental,
. socio-economic limitations that affect his social and
rpersonal development.

1

m: FOLLOWING suggested continuum of services is a
model that any community might adapt to the organ-
ional pattern of its public and voluntary recreation
cies. This focuses on helping each disabled individual
' ch his highest possible level of social independence.

aUAaY, 1965

With this long-term goal in mind, the continuum includes
five levels of recreation programing. Depending on the
individual participant, each of these programs can be re-
garded either as a step to the next level, or as the optimum
level of performance in social and recreative activity that
can be expected in view of the person’s actual limitations,
whether these limitations are physical, mental, socio-eco-
nomie or a combination of these factors.

Elements of recreation service provided at each level
include: education and information services, activity pro-
gram and leadership services, modification and adaptation
of equipment and facilities, counseling services; and con-
sultation and coordination services.

Program for the "Isolated" Person. Persons needing this
level of programing are usually ill or disabled children and
adults who have had little or no opportunity to be with
others outside their homes. Recreation personnel, trained
volunteers or surrogates work together to help the indi-
vidual—in his own home—explore and experiment with
activities that can promote development of psycho-physical
skills and a concept of mastery over inanimate objects.
Equipment is made available to persons in their homes in
much the same way as libraries loan books. When a par-
ticipant expresses interest in learning some particular ac-
tivity, personnel with special leadership skills in a specific
activity, go to the home to teach it to the participant and
his family. Activities are encouraged which provide im-
mediate satisfaction for the individual; as well as activities
that may promote healthful interaction and participation
among all those who are part of his home situation. When
feasible, activities involving minimal social interaction with
peers are arranged in and outside the home, such as cor-
respondence and telephone conversations with peers in
other special programs, followed by brief visits to these
programs for a special event. As the participant acquires
new recreation skills—interpersonal as well as physical—-
these latter activities may serve to prepare him for partici-
pation with peers in the next level of programing.

Program for the "Secluded" Person. III or disabled chil-
dren and adults who have had some opportunities to acquire
recreation knowledge, skill. and experience may be served
at an ordinary community center or comparable facility.
Recreation personnel on the center stalT are professionally
prepared to establish special groups for disabled persons
with respect to chronological age; physical, emotional. and
intellectual limitations; and levels of recreative skills. I’ro-
graming is intended to develop further skills, expand social
interaction experiences. and offer appropriate activities with
respect to age, such as pro-vocational opportunities for the
older teenager or young adult, community service activity
for the older participant. When an individual shows readi-
ness—when he has developed a number of interpersonal
as well as physical recreative skills and abilities—he is
gradually introduced to aggregate activity with some non.
disabled persons who attmtd ‘other 'recreation programs

71

within the center. This latter experience may serve to pre-
pare the person for participation with peers in the next
level of programing.

Program for the “Limited” Person. For disabled children
and adults who have had successful recreation experiences
with a few nondisabled peers, and have been able to use
at least one additional neighborhood recreation resource,
recreation-counseling may enable them to join ongoing in-
terest groups and clubs available to nondisabled persons
within the center and in other neighborhood facilities and
gradually increase their range of social interaction experi-
ences, developing greater social independence and skill in
using additional neighborhood recreation resources. In
some instances, participants in this program may need to
remain with “secluded” groups for some activities; but for
other activities may be capable of joining other groups
served by the center. Successful progression toward inde-
pendent participation of this kind depends on the limita-
tions imposed by disability and the quality of leadership
service. The experience available in this program may
serve to prepare a person for participation with peers in
the next level of programing.

Program for the “Included” Person. In programs serving
disabled children and adults who are able to use some of
the recreation resources in their home neighborhood, rec-
reation personnel arrange with a variety of public, private,
commercial, and church recreation programs in that neigh-
borhood to provide Opportunities for expanded social in-
teraction with nondisabled peers and increased opportuni-
ties for pre-vocational experience or for participation in the
community’s service programs. Consultation with person-
nel who work in the neighborhood programs is offered to
enable them to provide effective leadership with disabled
persons. These services may prepare a disabled person for
successful participation in the next program.

Program for the “Independent” Person. For disabled chil-
dren and adults who interact successfully with many non-
disabled persons from their own neighborhood, recreation
personnel can provide information and referral services to
facilitate broader use of community recreation resources
through the area, such as beaches, pools, zoos, museums,
concerts, camps, and the like. In programs of service for
the “independent” person, emphasis is placed on providing
public information and education to encourage nondisabled
persons to make the community’s recreation resources more
aVailable to persons with disabilities. Recreation counseling
is also offered to the disabled person’s family and friends,
to indicate to them how they can participate in a wide
variety of activities with him. The recreation specialist
working in this type of program makes every effort to
activate community recreation resources for providing
transportation, equipment, and otherwise expanding rec-
reative opportunities for disabled people. He enlists com-
munity-wide effort to remove architectural barriers and
stimulates development of special directories listing recre-
ation resources available to the disabled.

THE FOREGOING FIVE LEVELS of service suggest a method
of helping a disabled person progress toward indepen-
dence. But, realistically it must be recognized that be-

It is extremely important to establish groups with

lUPPETS IN WONDERLAND

traction of a marionette theater expands a park department’s summer festival

‘ MacGillivray
l

NE CORNER of the Garden of Wonders, Montreal’s
children’s zoo, a land of make-believe in which
I smaller animals are exhibited in storybook settings,
» upied by a popular puppet theatre. Le Theatre de
ionettes is a roccoco-style house to which is affixed an
ize marquee, the one containing the stage and the other
its canvas roof and its striped sides serving as the
torium with seating for 210.
any other circumstances this huge marquee with a
1 house at the end might seem a little strange, but in
arden of Wonders it fits right in with a fairytale vil-
that is entered by a drawbridge through castle gates,
an lnca Temple of the Sun, an Indian palace, Treasure
(1, an African village, and such like. There are about
exhibits in all, and the theater, though the largest, fits
ortably into the overall pattern.
1e auditorium measures fifty-six by twenty-four feet
has a sloping floor with a ten percent incline towards
tage. It is equipped with benches of two-inch plank
are fixed to the floor about three feet apart. Each
h is sixteen feet wide, permitting a four-foot aisle

along each side. The first three rows are only six inches
from the floor and are fine for very little children. The
next three rows are ten inches from the floor, the next three
fourteen inches and the rest are eighteen inches high.

twenty-four feet wide, twenty-five feet high, and sixteen
feet deep, giving ample room for settings and manipula-
tors. It includes a grid from which settings can be flown
with a system of weights and pulleys. There are twelve
drops for this purpose.

The manipulators’ platform is eight feet abcve the stage

The stage house itself is

level and runs around the four sides. permitting six manip-
ulators to operate freely at any one. time. There are ten
footlights and ten upper lights with dimmers with facilities
for special lighting effects.

The theater is a wooden structure and was construrtted at
a cost of 315,000. lt was designed by Roland l’roulx. a
parks department artist who designed litany of the elements
in the Garden of Wonders. and built by carlx‘nters and
technicians from the parks maintenance division. The
cost included underground conduits. materials. stage equip-
ment. and lighting.

During the first season. 1901. the show presented in this
theater was an adventure of llerge's intrepid reporter, Tin-

tin. titled “Prisoners of the Sun." which was presented in

T3

French and English by the internationally known Micheline
Legendre and her Marionettes de Montreal. The settings
were designed by another parks department artist, Raymond
Labelle, who followed the Herge drawings faithfully. The
sets were constructed in park department shops.

The performances that season were only moderately at-
tended and it was decided that the theater should be estab-
lished where the children were, to bring the theater to the
children. The one place where crowds of children could
be expected all summer long was the Garden of Wonders
which attracts upwards of four hundred thousand visitors
each summer. The move was successful from the start,
with near capacity houses for most of the three or four
performances a day. There are three shows each afternoon
on weekdays, four on Saturdays and Sundays. The first
season, the marionettes were underwritten by a sponsor
(Planters Peanuts) and the same sponsor was on hand the
next season to share any deficit that might occur.

Le Theatre de Marionettes, although directed mainly to-
wards children, forms part of a pattern of cultural enter-
prise that is offered to Montrealers and visitors each year
in the city’s Summer Festivals program. In 1964, this pro-
gram included a wide range of activities initiated by Mayor
Jean Drapeau and his Summer Festivals Committee. Co-
ordinator of festivals is Jean Dupire, information officer
in the parks department, which has been entrusted by the
civic administration with the handling of such special events.

The first International Salon of Cartoons, one of the fes-
tival events, was organized with the cooperation of the city’s
consular corps and presented in the Montreal Museum of
Fine Arts. The show included work of leading cartoonists
and caricaturists from twenty-eight countries.

Another festival highlight was the first International
Symposium of Sculpture for North America with ten lead-
ing sculptors from nine countries around the world execut-
ing their art in public at the art center in Mount Royal Park.
Other items on the program included an outdoor exhibition
of sculptures at the Botanical Garden. There was the an-
nual Square des Arts, an outdoor art show in Dominion
Square in the heart of the midtown area, and there was an-
other art show, Montreal ’64, in the Mount Royal Art Center.

For the first time pop concerts were held at the Maurice
Richard Arena where the patrons were able to enjoy wines
and cheeses with their music. The festivals also included
drills and pageantry of La Compagnie Franche de la Marine,
a company of cadets in the uniforms and bearing the arms
of the French Marines of the 18th century who performed,
did guard duty, and acted as guides at the historic barracks
and fort on St. Helen’s Island which now serve as military
museums. Band concerts, outdoor folk dancing, national
festivals of various ethnic groups in the Montreal commu-
nity and an International Film Festival were also on the
summer program. Montreal can truly be called a summer

wonderland! #

ation, namely bowling, is now being
recognized as an ally to public and pri-
vate agencies, playing an integral part
in the recreation setup.

Bowling, which once projected a
disreputable image, has undergone a
reformation and is now a “respectable”
activity, thanks largely to automated
equipment and proper promotion. In
Missouri, this transformation
spearheaded by the executive secretary
of the Missouri Bowling Proprietors’
Association, Lyle M. Dilley, and by
the proprietors comprising this organ-
ization. Mr. Dilley, a former recrea-
tion and social worker, has, in his eight

was

years of working with the proprietors,
developed a program of youth bowling
that has reached out and touched every
corner of Missouri and which two years
ago led to the creation of a national
program under the sponsorship of the
Bowling Proprietors’ Association of
America.

The Missouri Junior Bowling Con-
gress, of which Mr. Dilley is director,
now serves fifty-six thousand boys and
girls, from eight to eighteen, through-
out Missouri. Of these, twenty thou-
sand bowl in regularly scheduled sanc-
tioned league play with another thirty-
six thousand participating in a variety
of school bowling programs. A well-
developed, far-reaching program of
teaching bowling fundamentals is a re-
quired part of training for the coaches
and instructors responsible for working
with the youngsters. This same train-
ing course is given to all school and
recreation personnel who organize pro-
grams for the boys and girls in their
school or agency.

ADMINISTRATION

 

MEETING RECREATION ARE
STANDARDS: The Count

Leslie Lynch

OUNTIES are becoming more and more active in the
C administration of recreation and park services;

therefore it is of interest and value to know how
much recreation space is owned by counties. Nearly half
of the counties in the United States (excluding Alaska) lost
population between 1950 and 1960; about one-fourth lost
ten percent or more. Of the 1573 counties which gained
population, 60.6 percent increased in population by ten
percent or more; and 36.2 percent increased by twenty
percent or more. Sixteen counties included nearly one-
fifth of the total 1960 population.

No standard for recreation space has been nationally
accepted for counties. It has been recommended by experi-
enced authorities that there should be ten or fifteen acres
per thousand population of extraurban parks and reserva-
tions, in addition to the ten acres per thousand population
within the urban areas. This would mean that metrOpolitan
populations should have a total of twenty or twenty-live
acres of recreation space per thousand population; ten acres
per thousand within the urban area and ten or fifteen acres
per thousand outside the urban area. In view of the fact
that some counties already have ten acres per thousand pop-
ulation of extraurban parks which are used to capacity,
it is reasonable to say there should be at least fifteen acres
per thousand population of extraurban park area to meet
the needs of the future which will be far greater than the
needs of today.

The time may come when all recreation areas and serv-
ices will be administered on a county-wide basis. Until
that time comes, the municipal governments should be re-
sponsible for providing ten acres of recreation space within
their limits and the counties or metropolitan authorities
should be responsible for providing what is needed outside
the municipalities. However administered, there should be
a total of twenty-five acres per thousand of the metropoli-
tan or county population if the recreation needs of the fu-
ture are to be adequately met.

The accompanying table of recreation area statistics for
fifty-one counties is compiled from the acreage information

A RISING TIDE of defeats of special
construction bond issues school
budgets, and referendums reflects a
stirring public concern over budget
matters and tax dollars. Unfortunately,
this concern is sometimes characterized
by rash or impulsive moves, by rebel-

lions or so called “meat-ax” budget
cuts instead of objective appraisals of expenditures and

productivity. Be that as it may——rash or deliberate, emo-
tional or profound—the public concern and raised eyebrow
are there, and ever rising.

Social welfare, schools, defense, foreign aid, even pri-
vately supported service agencies——all have, during the
past eighteen years, based plans and operations upon the
magic password “growth.” Public recreation and park
budgets have been no exception. Growth explained all,
justified all. Nebulous planning, careless financing, esca-
lator salary scales, revolving-door personnel practices——
these were some of the many administrative sins swept
under the rug in a breathless lunge forward to keep up
with growth. Growth here was not limited to mere popu-
lation statistics but was couched in terms of “upgrading,”
“growth of standards,” “program enrichment,” “advance-
ment in depth,” “quality progress,” and similar catch
phrases. These semantics no longer awe the American tax-
payer. Over his shoulder, he nervously eyes a national
debt of some $300,000,000,000, which stands in the
colossal shadow of a gross public and private debt of
$1,000,000,000,000—not millions, billions, but a trillion!

This means the time has come when public officials and
administrators must put that tool of tools, the creative
imagination, to heavy overtime use. Is this reason for
pessimism? Certainly not. The administrator worth his
salt thrives on challenge. Recreation and park profession-
als, though they hold no monopoly on inventiveness, have
demonstrated their ingenuity and pioneer spirit in the past.
They should, and I am certain will, rise to this opportunity

Self-help. Develop and cultivate an atmosphere of
help and self-sufficiency on the part of the public in re
tion and park matters. An outstanding example of
technique is the history of public recreation and par
Baltimore County, Maryland. Commencing in the late
ties under the leadership of one dynamic, plan-mi
individual, this program has grown into a smoothly i
tioning department of recreation and parks for a coun
five hundred thousand. lts philosophy, its program,
its techniques are as fresh and as vital as the dat
department began fifteen years ago. Because depart
growth here was based on careful stimulation of ci
groups rather than staff-bloating, the volunteer cont
tions of ideas, money, leadership, and enthusiasm to
county-wide programs have been enormous. The key 
ture is the local community recreation council, some
hundred of which operate in neighborhoods and na
home groupings throughout the county, planning, gui
and participating in their own localized programs an
tivities. The proprietary attitude toward recreation a
ties on the part of these volunteer groups is somethin
marvel at. Meanwhile, the professional staff of the de
ment has been kept to the bare minimum required for e

tive leadership, guidance and facility improvement.

Use volunteers on a massive scale. Here’s an

the staggering increase in numbers of healthy retired
available, we may experience a positive demand that
eager, willing, and frequently skilled people be ab-
as busy and happy volunteers. I can visualize the
omc decade or two hence, when whole parks or play-
pl installations will be manicured, painted, decorated,
wired for day to day by battalions of willing volun-

tumv. 1965

In the hallowed American way to sell a product and make

a living. it behooves the alert recreation and park execu-
tive to reach these people, to get to know them and to
cooperate with them. If, due to faulty communications, or
total lack. of same, a poor mutual image exists, correct it.
To stumble blindly into competition with these business
pe0ple through ignorance is unforgiveahle. If you can
reach them, share ideas, establish standards of appearance
and conduct and, finally, join in sponsoring certain events
together, you have done these entrepreneurs and your city
or town a service. There is a very good chance that pro-
gram expansion of this kind can be accomplished without
greatly expanding your budget. Cosponsored Saturday
bowling programs, dance classes, concerts. roller-rink
event, and hundreds of other wholesome programs have
resulted from this type of partnership. In our own city
we are exploring the establishment of a local commercial
recreation council which would meet bimonthly to further
this kind of communication and cooperation. (See also
Page 76.)

Research on maintenance. This presents a real oppor-
tunity to park executives searching for ways to do the job
in a more efficient and less costly way. Read the trade
journals, visit conferences, interview salesmen. There is no
substitute for this kind of professional alertness. One
device we are currently exploring is that of “farming out"
routine maintenance work on small playgrounds and green
spots scattered throughout the city. When we have de-
termined some form of unit cost for routine work on
these, we will compare the expense of our full-time per-
sonnel doing it, with prices quoted by local landscaping
firms on an annual basis. We are curious to see if the
more specialized machinery and skills of the landscape-r
may undercut the costs of our wide-ranging crews who
travel citywide and include bench repairs. cleaning. cut-
ting, fertilizing, and a series of other odd iobs during any
one workday. This, of course, is but one isolated illustra-
tion of the kind of research and inventiveness necessary if
we are to keep ahead of our problems.

Drop obsolete services. Government appears most re-
luctant in this area. Nevertheless. herein lies one of the sur-
est ways of accomplishing new, vital tasks and services

small, schools and private agencies. are carrying little pets.
ideas, or projects we personally favor or which we feel look
“nice” to the public. Unless they are clearly prmluctivc,
they should be dropped. Hold yoUr entire operation up to
the cold light of appraisal at least once a year. Don't trust
yourself. insist that other competent staff people do the
same. A basic characteristic and virtue of public recrea-
tion and park work is its freshness. flexibility. and sensitiv-
ity to the need for change. Regular “spring cleaning" of
programs and services is consistent with such flexibility.
Let's demonstrate to the public the hold ingenuity which
has moved the profession of recreation and parks to the
frontline position it holds today. #

STATE

AND

LOCAL
DEVELOPMENTS

ELVIRA DELANY

 

ARIZONA. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors

has unanimously approved master plans for the White Tank
Mountain Regional park and a metropolitan canal parks
system. Groundwork for both plans was laid by citizen
groups who analyzed need and made recommendations to
the professional planners. Five other volunteer committees
involving 190 citizens are working to complete plans for the
Usery, McDowell, Estrella, Paradise Valley, and Thunder-
bird county parks.

The White Tank plan is for a regional park that will
blend unspoiled nature, wilderness preserve, wildlife refuge
and open space. Development will be restricted to enable
maximum enjoyment of natural environment. The 28,554-
acre park, largest locally operated park in the nation, is
located about fifteen miles west of Peoria. It forms the west-
ern horizon of the Salt River Valley. Proposed facilities
include a park headquarters area at the mouth of Dripping
Springs Canyon, and interpretive center, main concession
building, and nature school. The plan also provides for
picnic and camp grounds, thirty-six miles of riding trails,
eighteen miles of hiking trails, a stable area and rodeo arena,
facilities for scout camps and youth work campgrounds.

The canal parks plan envisions a system of aquatic parks
to serve some twenty-eight areas along canals from Higley
on the east to 83rd Avenue west of Glendale. More than a
hundred miles of Salt River Project canals would form a
basis for the system. Development and financing would be
the responsibility of the municipality in which each is lo-
cated. Each park is designed to serve an immediate neigh-
borhood unit while at the same time attracting automobiles,
bicycles, hikers, and horseback riders on a community-wide
scale. The plan recommends an average spacing of between
two and a half and five miles apart. Focal point of each
canal park would be a lagoon receiving water from the
canal and large enough for fishing, canoeing, and model
boat racing. Facilities also are suggested for picnicking,
bicycling, crosscountry running, horseback riding, and

hiking.

as they relate to the economic growth of Arkansas, the State

mendations for the development of recreation and
facilities. It said certain conditions must be met
recreation and tourism can become as important to th
economically as manufacturing has become in recent
The report said these conditions include:

0 Creation of a division in the State Publicity and
Commission with tourism as its major responsibility

0 Adoption of the federal parks classification syste
allocation of money to deveIOp new parks; re-exami

mission in Berkeley. One was how best to meet the re
park needs of neighboring counties and their merging
areas. The other was how to improve the public’s o
manners. County park and recreation officials from tb
out the state were on hand to present their thinking r
ing the growing need for regional parks and to explo
feasibility of setting regional park standards.

All agreed that merging urban areas are creating ou
recreation problems that transcend county boundaries
regional parks are needed to serve regional population
regional park standards would have to vary from
to region; and that the management of a regional

Most agreed that while serving large numbers of p

regional parks should be operated within this philos

sion Chairman Mrs. Dewey J. Forry said it seemed app
that if any regional park standards are to be evolved
will have to be very general, and that the counties will

The public’s outdoor manners turned up as a pri
topic during the commission’s regular meeting follo
the regional park hearing. It popped up in the commiss
review of its September 17 public hearing in Reddin
garding liability relief for private landowners who op
their land to public recreation. The commission noted
private landowners who testified at the hearings were
worried about liability than they were about fires and }
erty damage caused by thoughtless recreationists.
commission also noted that many landowners declared
they could not provide public recreation in competition

City manager and the commissioners have been in agreement

for some time that additional launching facilities are needed
on the river. Talks with officials of other cities that have
launching ramps and also with the US. Army Corps of
Engineers finally convinced them to get work under way on
a first-class, permanent ramp for Columbus. An existing
city ramp at the site of the old city docks, just south of Dil-

lingham Street, probably will be leased to a private industrial
firm.

IDAHO. Boaters’ fuel tax money is being used to help build
new launching and docking facilities at Palisades lleservoir
in the southeast corner of the state. in cooperation with
Bonneville County and the Caribou National Forest, the
Motor Vehicles Division of the Idaho Law Enforcement
Department has tapped the state marine fuel tax fund
(known as the \Vaterways Improvement Fund) to build a
$9,000 concrete boat launching ramp at the Palisades lies
ervoir Campground. Other new improvements include a
20’-by-20’ boat loading dock (it’s made up of eight floating
ramps fastened together) at Calamity Point, plus several

floating docks for water skiers at various points around the
reservoir.

KANSAS. Milford Lake, the new U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers impoundment in northeastern Kansas, is still filling.
When completed it will boast fifteen thousand surface acres
of water and a shoreline of 180 miles. There is tremendous
potential here for recreation boating, and Mid-America
Associates, a new private development firm, has been quick
in recognizing it. The firm’s plans for building $10,000,000
Thunderbird llesort on the western shores of Milford Lake
four miles north of Junction City include a marina and boat

three acres of sand beach, and a golf course, will be in the

a wind protected area with quiet water for boating and
water skiing. The resort is expected to he completed by 1966.

towns to consolidate public recreational facilities. “This

Our acceptance and reception as im-
portant advisors will depend upon our
professional knowledge in the recrea-
tion field and our ability to instill con-
fidence and communicate with enthu-
siasm. In addition, our success will
depend upon our social skills and a
quality which many describe, for want
of a better term, as “polish.”

With the rapid rate of increase of
knowledge in the recreation field, as
well as in allied fields with which rec-
reation leaders must deal, it is becom-
ing increasingly evident that education
can never be completed. Education is
a continuing and never-ending process.
Therefore, professional people are
urged to pursue all educational oppor-
tunities available, not only at the Na-
tional Recreation Association’s annual
National Institutes in Recreation Ad-
ministration, but at all training ses-
sions and workshops that may be avail-
able to them.

Plans are now under way for the
Tenth National Institute in Recreation
Administration, to be held in Minne-
apolis, October 2-3, 1965. The subject
selected for the next Institute is “Cre-
ative Problem Solving.” Some of the
national authorities in this field will
present this important subject to rec-
reation and park administrators. Pro-
gram details will be available soon.

It is not enough for recreation ex-
ecutives to read the daily newspapers
and have a few years of experience.
It is not enough to glance at a few
periodicals or read a book, now and
then; nor it it enough to confine the

study just to the field of recreation.

'UARY, 1965

Speaking of Greek tragedies, Euripi-
des would fix the whole thing in no time
by rolling out a deus-ex-machina to
solve the unsolvable; but this is the
twentieth century, and the machine has
become more popularly known as a
custom-sales department. To see how it
works, let’s look in on a typical amateur
group, a church choir, as it prepares for
a recording session after making ar-
rangements with the custom-sales de-
partment of a major record company.

The choir has about twenty-five mem-
bers, and, since they are well known by
their congregation, it would not be un-
reasonable for them to hope to sell
about a hundred copies of a record of
themselves to the parishioners, provid-
ing the cost is not too high, say about
five dollars per record. Of course, it
shouldn’t be hard to sell many more
than this, but, for the purposes of our
illustration, let’s stick with this mini-
mum figure.

NOW, the first step in making a re-
cording is to book a studio. The
usual LP record has about forty-five
minutes of music on it. From past ex-
perience, recording engineers recom-
mend about six minutes of studio time
for each minute of program as heard
on the finished record. This means four
and a half hours in the studio—figure
five hours for an extra safety margin.
After the session is over. the tape will
have to be edited to remove the un-
desired “takes” and to arrange the num-
bers in the sequence desired on the
record. Then. a master lacquer is cut
and sent to the pressing plant. the com-
plete order is pressed, packed in record
jackets, and sent to the client. This en-
tire operation is basically the same. as
that used for the company’s regular
classical or popular recordings.

When the session was over. the edit-
ing done, and the finished pressing de-
livered, the total bill for a hundred two-
sided Li’s came to a bit less than $500.
Dividing this by a hundred copies we
have just about five dollars per record!
Of course, costs computed hourly for
recording sessions and editing, and by
quantity for the pressings, will fluctu-
ate from one group to another, depend-
ing on the particular requirements of
each group.

We have been talking about an order
of a hundred records so far, to vividly
illustrate the possibilities for even the
smallest of musical organizations.

Compared with amateur orchestras.
School choruses and bands, the usual
church choir is substantially smaller.
rarely exceeding twenty-five members.
With a little planning, even such a lim-
ited number as this can successfully
make a recording. It also should not be
difficult to exceed the minimum order
of a hundred mentioned above. Since
costs per record come down as quan-
tity ordered goes up, this could be a
great money-making opportunity for the
group. For example. an order of 250
records, sold at five dollars each would
realize a profit of almost 3700. Five-
hundred records sold at the same price
would return a 81.700 profit to the.
choir!

A family and friends for orders—be

prepared for that unreasonable person
who wants to be. sure he's going to get
his money’s worth. He'll want to know
just how good these records are going
to be. After all. he just spent about the.
same amount for the latest Messiah
Highlights album. Are you going to be
just as good, he‘ll want to know? Now
before you go slinking away defeated.

parties agreed that incorporating bowl-
ing into the playground operation un-
der the city’s “learn-to” method of ap-
proach, so successful in swimming,
tennis, and skating, was feasible. In-
itially, a training course was developed
for the recreation division’s adminis-
trative staff and a representative from
each of the 105 playgrounds.
Playground staff members ap-
proached this training course with ap-
prehension, but, once the program was
broken down into simple one, two,
three steps and the theory of this
method explained they responded en-
thusiastically. Since the recreation di-
vision operates under a five-region

ers that the record they are buying from
you will be a faithful reproduction of
your group’s capabilities, recorded on
and by the finest of equipment.

One final word to help you keep costs
down to the minimum. Since we said
that recording sessions and editing fees
are computed on an hourly basis, it is
to your advantage to keep these times
to a minimum, without undue rushing,
of course. Before coming to the studios,
plan what you expect to accomplish. The
engineers will be happy to wait while
you decide what to sing next and where
the music is, but it’s your own money
you’re wasting, and if you have all this

young people to vacation independent-

Giveaway Fish
G IVING AWAY a fish is not as easy as
it may appear. In Florida, where
fishermen are likely to have extra fish,
it has become a highly devel0ped sci-
ence. Almost anybody can give away
a fish in the daytime, especially a
cleaned fish. At night, skill is required.
If the recipient is already in bed and
doesn’t care too much for fish anyway,
it takes a real artist to give him a dead
fish, especial'y if it is uncleaned and
having an odor a little like a dead fish.
The enthusiastic approach is easiest.
Call the victim on the telephone and tell
him you have a surprise for him. If
he has been asleep he may fall for this

and have the door unlocked by the time
you get to his home.

A real old-time giver with plenty of
confidence will take the bull by the
horns and say: “Come over to my place
right now. llurry!" Then, he hangs up
and the fish-getter will be 011 hand
(probably wearing his pajama tops)
and have the fish before he really knows
what happened.

In delivering a fish at a late hour (all
fishermen arrive home late}, it is best
to ring the doorbell or hang the knock-
er briskly and be ready to thrust one
muddy foot through the door. Hold
the fish behind you and thrust it into
the victim’s hands while making a di-
versionary remark such as: “Have you
been listening to your radio?” The
fishogetter will assume that an atomic
attack is imminent and will grasp eon-
vulsively at anything offered hin1———-in
this case a dead fish.

In Florida, most folks can catch fish
for themselves and therefore look with
scorn on everyone else’s cateh. If the
victim is a fisherman himself, the giv-
er can stand on the stoop with the fish
behind him and say: “\Vhat is the
world’s record for channel bass?” The
victim will pause and try to remember
and will absentmindedly grasp the prof-
fered seafood.

Only a coward would ring a doorbell,
deposit a fish on the step and run. Ar-
dent fishermen who persistantly present
fish to their neighbors will note that

cipients often show rema.kable growth

beauty. This is a bad thing for fish
conservation.

0 AFTER THE FIRE. Insistent urging by Connecticut’s Deputy
State Fire Marshal Major Carroll E. Shaw and other local
fire authorities has resulted in the development of a new fire
safety latching device for hospital and institution doors. As
a direct result of the tragic 1961 Hartford Hospital fire,
Stewart A. Sprague, chief engineer of Hartford Hospital,
joined engineers in designing the new latch. Until recently
hospital patient-room doors had been designed primarily
for ease in opening and closing by nurses, whose arms are
usually loaded with supplies. They were not equipped with
positive latches. During the hospital holocaust, these doors
had to be heavily barricaded in order to keep them shut
against the tremendous pressure created when fire swept
down the corridor.

The new latch incorporates convenient push-pull opening
features with positive latching action to meet modern fire
safety requirements. Instead of turning a knob, the door
opens from the corridor by simply pressing against a large
curved plate, which releases the latch. A curved lever, simi-
lar to the blade handle used on hospital faucet controls, re-
leases the latch from inside the room. If a person’s hands
are full, just hook a wrist, arm or elbow over the lever,
unlatch the door and gently pull it open. The latches are
constructed of durable cast bronze and come in either satin
chrome or satin bronze finish. (These safety latches should
be considered for use in other public buildings where large
crowds congregate.) Write to the Russwin Division of Em-
hart Corporation, New Britain, Connecticut, for further

' Safe Use of Chemicals

‘ nioinc
I OST OF US are involved either di-
rectly or indirectly in some
- of pest control on the grounds
aintain, and it is necessary for
f us, at one time or another, to
and re-evaluate our present tech-
es and attempt to make our spray
weed control programs as safe and
tive as possible. Since damage to
mature tree, shrub, or turf area is
ially serious, due to replacement
, plant toxicity by chemicals is of
r importance to any discussion of
application of chemicals. There-
we must give particular consider-
to the following cautions:
ever apply a new material until
have tested it under your local
itions on a small scale. This prac-
may save some severe, widespread
age.
ever mix your materials without
oughly knowing their respective
atabilities. It is convenient when
an take care of several problems
one application, but it is far more
tical to make two or more applica-
. than to answer questions concern-
the cause of damage to or death
luable trees or shrubs.
ever use any of these materials
the temperature is above 90°F.
hen the humidity is below thirty
ent. Oil sprays are especially dan-
us to use at these levels, but wet-
powders and emulsions can be
as hazardous at times.
ash off tropicals and tender, young
ts that might be under or around
: or shrubs you are spraying. Al-
b you may realize no damage, in
cases it is proven that these plants
stand the toxic effects of chemicals

lesser degree than do woody
ts.

ANTOINE is a consultant with the
arold Mitchell Company in San
icl, California. This material was

i at the 1964 California and Pacific

h-west Recreation and Park Con-
Ce.

.UARY, 1965

0 Each crew of spray personnel should
be equipped with adequate scales, and
measuring equipment. To send some-
one out to spray with only calculated
guesses as a means of measuring quan-
tities of chemicals is like pointing a
revolver at your head and pulling the
trigger.

o Applicators should be equipped with
rubber gloves, respirators, and rubber
boots. Constantly observe your per-
sonnel while performing their work
and attempt to find any unsafe situa-
tions. The older, more experienced
men are the worst offenders in regard
to personal safety practices. They often
become oblivious to the unsafe manner
in which they perform their job.

0 Alert your applicators to hazards
from spray drift. Toxic weed control
materials and sterilants are the most
damaging, but, needless to .say, any
spray material is dangerous to use in
periods of high winds.

0 Establish a program of washing out
spray tanks, hoses, and pumps after
using any herbacide and before spray-
ing ornamentals. If you have not con-
sidered buying separate equipment for
weed work exclusively, check into the
possibility or feasibility of it. It is
false economy to use the same equip-
ment for both ornamental spraying and
weed work.

0 Always stake outside the root zone
of trees and shrubbery when using
fumigants and sterilants. Where areas
are sloped, make use of dams or fur-
rows to keep the materials from wash-

ing or eroding into the plant root
areas.

Note On The Cuff

0 Maryland reports a sixty-three per-
cent decrease in highway litter removal
costs since the start of the Keep Mary-
land Beautiful program. Liltering in
state parks has dropped an estimated
twenty to thirty percent.

worked endless hours on the develop-
ment of up-to-date programs that will
keep producing a caliber of skier with
championship spirit and a deep sense
of American ideals.

Following the close of World War
II, ski programs throughout the world
thrived anew with eagerness and com-
petitive spirit. Duluth was quick to un-
fold a program for senior jumpers and
followed shortly after with competi-
tions in cross country and slalom. With
this action, the junior programs again
caught lire, and prospective champions
began to make their appearance. In
1948 the first Junior National Ski
Jumping championships were held at
Chester Bowl in Duluth, and proudly
we decorated a Duluth boy as one of
the winners in this historic event. Since
that time Duluth has sent teams to all
parts of the United States for national
competition and no less than six na-
tional champions have returned to Du-
luth.

Training sessions for unior and sen-
ior competitors are held weekly at area
ski sites. Older experienced skiers,
with a broad knowledge of technique,
work with small groups of trainees.

In recent years the Central United
States Ski Association set up special
training camps for youngsters in sla-
lom, cross-country, and jumping. Since
infancy, these camps have been held in
various places, but recently have been
centrally located where good snow falls

Create With Yarn, Ethel Jane Beitler.
International Textbook Company,

Scranton 15, Pennsylvania. Pp. 196.
$7.50.

STITCI-IERY is a field of art that is fast
becoming very popular again after
a long quietus and is now used in art
classes because of the encouragement
one gets from the variations that can
be done with color and yarn plus mate-
rials. This book is divided ' into two
parts, hooking and stitchery, giving the
basic steps of each process. Stitches
well-known to most of the older genera-
tion are used very creatively. These are
crafts which recreation leaders should
explore. Today’s young people do not
know the simple stitches—let alone how
to use a needle or thread or thimble. In
hooking, though it is an old craft, the
approach is very different. It is a beau-

tifully photographed and easy-to-read
book.

The author writes: “Stitchery is a
quiet and calm sort of activity that gives
a person time to sit and ponder on the
day’s joys and sorrows or time to think
through the problems of the day, and.
while pondering, the craftsman may be
developing a web of stitches which
blend together the gay and the dull
strands of life and give them meaning.”

It seems to me that we could use a
craft like this in these turbulent times
and that our programs in recreation
could well afford to include quiet crea-
tive work with yarns. Let’s try it!—
Mary B. Cummings, arts and crafts
specialist.

IN BRIEF

THE CITY AND THE ARTS, August Heck-
scher. Institute of Local Government,
University of Pittsburgh. Pp. 16. Pa-
per, 3150. Mr. Heckscher’s main con-
cern in this publication is for the t0p-

level artist and organization and what
can be done to enrich community life
by bringing them together with local
government in a close working relation-
ship. His attitude toward arts councils
and other forms of cooperative arrange-
ments between public and private bod-
ies is favorable. Several important ex-
amples are cited in The City and the
Arts. The role of educational, recrea-
tional, and other community services
affecting the arts is practically ignored.
He puts the solution of the problem in
the hands of the select few. City hall
which deals with the public at large
and the public welfare will probably
want a solution based on the interde-
pendence of all forces affecting the cul-
tural life of the city at all levels includ-
ing recreation and education.

en, two parties for twelve-year-olds, one
for the thirteens, three for the fourteens,
and one for the fifteens. Keys to behav-

gested schedule all combine to make thls
a most useful book for parents, leaders,
