SPACE and PEOPLE (Part I)

What are we going to do about our
cities? When that eminent critic Nikita
Khrushchev, who has the critic’s first
qualification of being unafraid to blurt
out the obvious, looked out on our teem-
ing streets and said: “Cars, ears, ears!
Isn’t there any place for people?” he
put his finger unerringly on the great
blind spot of our civic planning, what
little of that there is, and on our na-
tional obsession. Everything is planned
for the automobile, not for the people.

When I was in Keene, New Hamp-
shire, for a lecture I was commenting
on the beauty of the 1 Tew England town.
and the lady I was talking to remarked
wistfully that it was much more beauti-
ful before they cut down all the trees
on Main Street to provide additional
room for parking. “Of course,” she

added hastily. “I’m not against progress

but. . . ."
* * * ‘I'

Progress? Where on earth did we get
the idea that a traffic iam is progress?
In Goodbye. Am, Richard Bissell sav-
agely bewails the tearing down of the
oldest and most beautiful buildings in
town—--and God knows there are few
enough beautiful ones in the Midwest
-——to make parking lots. Again that
word progress raises its vicious little
head.

In Springfield, Massachusetts. these
lovely makers of progress iust tore
down a good part of the loveliest park
in town to make way for a highway.
Progress.

I was in Indianapolis a year ago
when they were trying an experiment,
banning ears from a few streets in the
very center of town. lThe evperirnent
was tried in many cities.) The streets
were planted with grass. Actually. they
rolled out strips of sod but it was real
grass and felt like it nnder your feet.
There were little trees in tnbs but they
gave you the idea and feel of a street
with bigger trees. with shade and deep
foliage.

Well. of course. it is not progress
but, Lord, it"s great. For one thing the
sense of hurry, or urgency, disappears.
You find yourself strolling not hnrrv-
ing. You stroll down the middle of the
street in the sunshine. not in the shade

of the buildings. (Under progress, the
cars get all the sunshine.) Just for a
moment, I felt with absolute certainty
that I was looking into the future city.
(Indianapolis decided the mall was bad
for business and abandoned it.)

'I 'I * *

I’m willing to bet $1,000,000 that a
hundred years after I’m dead (my sue-
eessors will be only to happy to pay off
if I’m wrong) the central streets of all
big American cities will have grass
rather than ears because the traffic sit-
uation is rapidly becoming intolerable.
Of course, the amount of discomfort
and delay that an American, especially
a New Yorker, can put up with without
complaining or even noticing is as-
tounding. Still, there are limits—at
least, I think there are.

Where, you ask, is the snapping point
of mankind‘s patience? Well—just as
a guess—I think that the day a New
Yorker starts out from Washington
Square by taxicab on a Monday and
doesn’t get to Grand Central until the
following Thursday. “I've missed my
train,” he'll say. “Something is clearly
wrong." But it may take a hundred
yea rs before he looks up from his paper.

In the few cases where citizens have
looked up from their newspapers. the
terrible ravages of the automobile have
been halted. In Longrneadow. Massa-
ehusetts, for example. the geniuses who
design state highways were going to
run a superhighway through the heart
of town, obliterating the two lovely vil-
lage greens. The citizenry met and de-
feated the advance of the antomobile by
a vote of one hundred to zero.

I I I *

Above all, it is going to require some
reexamination of our values. Do we
really need parking lots more than we
need parks for our children to play?
Cutting down a hundred-vear-old elm
to provide a spot to park the Mercury,
isn't this idiocy? Of course, it is. Ae-
tnally. one of the more hideons sights
in a modern world ( which has manv of
them) is a parking lot and I think, if
we have to have the terrible things I and
I suppose we do), they should be re-
quired to plant a little grove of trees to
mask them from view-ma sort of peni-
tential offering to replace all the trees
sacrificed to the automobile.

Surrehuttal
Sirs:

I was most interested in Jay Shivers’
article “Saying What We Mean” in the
October issue of RECREATION. If this
marks the “open season” on terminol-
ogy, I would like to get in my two cents
worth and offer a “surrebuttal”:

Literature of many professions is
filled with controversy concerning ter-
minology and definition of terms. Such
difficulties always plague growing pro-
fess10ns and recreatlon 1s no exception.

Charles Brightbill (February, 1959)

and Jay Shivers express diametricallv
opposite views of what we should call
our professional recreation worker.
Each I am sure, is sincere in his inter-
pretation and use of etymological pro-
cesses. Being more favorable to the
Brightbill-Ruud use of the recreator to
describe the professional, I wish to add
my interpretation and documentation
to the discussion.

Philologists look to the Oxford Dic-
tionary as an authority on English etv-
mologv and orthography. One could
read through these volumes and find
support for either stand. However, in
my opinion, the evidence leans toward
recreator, rather than recreationist.

Recreation is defined as a noun of ac-
tion derived from the Latin verb recrc-
are and the English verb recreatc.
Recreate is derived from recreat. the
past participle stem of recreare which
means to restore or refresh. Thus, it
scems logical that we should use recre-
atology rather than Brightbill’s recre-
ology.

The sufExes -or, -er and -ist appear
to be used interchangeably with littlc
differentiation. However, there are
some clues which may help to choose
the most appropriate one. The legal
use of -or, denoting the person acting
as opposcd to the person acted upon.
has imparted a technical or professional
character to the -or ending. This is par-
ticularly true of words with a European
etymology. In most cases where -er is
the ending, today the Middle English
suffix was -oar and the modern equiva-
lent should be -or.

The distinction is further demon-
strated under the definition of -er: “The

Readers are invited to share their
views on these pages. Comments
of general interest are always wel-
come. —— The Editors.

agent-nouns belonging to verbs from
Latin past-participle stems, and those
formed with -ate, usually end in -or, be-
ing partly adoptions from Latin and
partly assimilated to Latin analogies.
But, when the sense is purely agential,
Without any added notion such as that
of office, trade or profession, function,
etcetera, -er is often used.”

There can be no doubt that recreator
falls within this rule. It is derived from
a Latin past-participle stem, the noun
form comes from a verb ending with
-ate, and its definition as used by
Brightbill-Ruud correctly qualifies it
under the exception as quoted in the
last sentence.

The use of the sufo -ist is frowned
upon unless it is added to “some sci-
ence, art, or branch of knowledge origi-
nally expressed by a word of Greek
formation.” Thus, since recreation is of
Latin derivation and not Greek, we
would be vulgarizing further the Eng-
lish language to adopt this word.

EDWARD H. THACKER, Recreation

Analyst, District of Columbia Recre-

ation Department, Washington, D. C.

I' 'I' 'I' *

Sirs:

I want to compliment Dr. Shivers for
“Saying What We Mean”. . . . I too
have been opposed to the term Recrea-
tor, believing that it only added another
Word which only adds to the confusion
of the public, for we still have a long
way to go in explaining recreation as a
function in our society.

I agree . . . that if we want to define
the recreation professional we can more
logically call him a recreationist. I
have, however, even avoided this. I re-
fer to the recreation professional as
either a director of recreation or recre-
ation-educator, believing that they are
more descriptive of what is done by the
individual.

H. D. EDGREN, Professor of Recrea-

tion Leadership, Purdue University,

Lafayette, Indiana.

* 'I' 'I' *

Sirs:
Dr. Shiver’s position on terminology
is well taken. I would like to go a step

453

further as I do particularly care for
either recreator or recreationist as a
label for leaders in the field of recrea-
tion. It seems to me that the question
here is “are we really working in the
field of recreational service?”

The children who take part in our
supervised activities are “growing up”
and not participating in activities for
re-creation. The retired oldsters fall
into the same category. Their time
spent in our activities is not a respite
from the rigors of a work or existence
experience. Their activity is an end in
and of itself. This is becoming more
and more true of everyone as our work
responsibility becomes less arduous.
We must find terminology which is
more suitable to the kind of work we
do. . . . We must have a label for our-
selves for the National Registration
Plan.

HENRY T. SWAN, Superintendent of

Recreation, Phoenix, Arizona.

We Keep 0111' Balance

Sirs:

I would like to send along my compli-
ments on the new format of RECREA-
TION Magazine. 1 have enjoyed the
articles a great deal and feel that they
show a very nice balance. As profes-
sionals working primarily with volun-
teer leaders we look forward to material
in this vein. Keep up the good work.

Interagency Relations
Sirs:

J ac Cropley’s article in the November
RECREATION brought to mind our local
group of professional agency personnel,
known as the Boys’ Workers Executive
Council, and part of the answer, at least,
in aiding relations between the various
organizations within our community.

(Mount Vernon, a suburb of New York
City, has a population of 76,000.)

Our boys’ workers group consists of
one or more representatives from the

following agencies: Board of Educa-
tion, Boys’ Club, Boy Scouts, Children’s
Court, Police Athletic League, Police
Department Youth Bureau, Salvation
Army, Society for Prevention of Cru-
elty to Children, YMCA, and, of course,
our own recreation commission. This
group, formed more than twenty-five
years ago, meets once each month for an
informal luncheon followed by a regu-
lar business and professional meeting.

The advantages of such a group to
the recreation director are numerous.
These frequent meetings foster and
strengthen professional relationships.
Getting to know the various agency di-
rectors and becoming familiar with the
many different programs affords the
recreation director the opportunity of
sharing these facilities in his public rec-
reation program and using specifically
trained personnel from these agencies
in his own program. To be sure. this
mutual relationship is carried to these
other agencies who will be frcc to call
upon the recreation director for hclp
in many ways, as Mr. Cropley mentions,
thus lending a “partnership” atmos-
phere with the entire community as the
benefactor.

Specifically, the group has no con-
stitution, other than a few basic organ-
izational rules. The group is little
known throughout the community, the
membership desiring to work behind
the scenes and without any fanfare or
publicity. Some of the meetings take
on a secretite attnosphcrc at times when
specific individuals or problcms are dis-
cussed. Guest speakers, films, and in-
terest are a part of the informal pro-
gram.

Our boys’ workers group . . . is . . .
one of the many reasons that makes our
local recreation program thc good one
that it is.

What do you do with children to
whom a coke bottle is weapon, who dip
handkerchiefs into an automobile gas
tank to get high on the fumes? Ofice
in the Alley is a report on a project
with gang youngsters in the border city
of El Paso, Texas, told by the “bicycle
padre,” Father Harold J. Rahm, SJ
(once a gang youngster himself) and
J. Robert Weber, MSW. Here is what
happened when a church decided its
youth center was not attracting the
“wrong” kind of kids and sent out “ag-
gressive social workers” to reach gang
youngsters. Help came from many
sources including equipment and funds
from the city recreation department and
its “conscientious, social-minded” di-
rector Robert Shipp, now Southwest
district representative of the National
Recreation Association. (An article on
Father Rahm and his program, en-
titled “A Miracle in El Paso,” appeared

272.) This 71-page report, illustrated
with photographs, is available for $.25

WINTER’S GIFTS - at Christmas

Mildred Furry Petit

HEN THIS MAGAZINE arrives, the Christmas work-
W shop of many a recreation center will be the scene
of intense activity. The room will be filled with
people fashioning evergreen branches, shiny ornaments,
candles, cones, and gay ribbon bows into cheerful decora-
tions for their homes. The fragrance of greens will be
mixed with the smell of gilt spray, and humble objects will
take on a look of glamor. But sometime during that busy
season there is almost certain to come a magic moment.

Unknown to those so intent upon their tasks indoors,
snow has softly fallen outside. Puffs of it are caught in the
hedges and bushes. Each evergreen is a pyramid of crystal-
line whiteness, and familiar objects have assumed soft con-
tours and strange shapes.

As the workers laden with Christmas decorations step
outside, they stop, first in consternation and then in wonder.
They look out over the wide expanse of white, sparkling
with innumerable jewels, and forget for a moment the prob-
lems of getting home through snow-filled streets and roads.
Clothed with a feeling akin to reverence they gaze at the
gift of beauty spread hefore them—a gilt unlike many of the
gifts of men—given bountifully and quietly by Him whose
love has given us Christmas.

It has been but a brief moment of magic, but those who
experience it feel suddenly warm and gay and go home
refreshed.

Similar unexpected gifts may he dropped into our laps
throughout this Christmastide. As we step outdoors to pick
up the evening paper we may see the trees silhouetted
against the dying flame of the winter sun and thc rosy tingc
on the snow turn to purple shadows. Silcnce seems to rule

the world, intensified rather than disturbed by the sound
of a motor or the distant barking of a dog.

While trarnping in the woods we see a log blanketed
with shiny green moss in what appeared to he a wholly
white world. A bit further on, some green Christmas fern
clings to the ground. Small tracks in the snow remind us

Adapted from “Winter’s Gifts for You at Christmas” in
Kingwood Center Notes, Mansfield, Ohio.

that we are never really alone and that creatures other than
ourselves are finding what they seek from the earth.

Some m0rning the fernlike foliage of a tropical forest
will be etched on the windowPanes and the weeds will be
topped with feathery, frosty plumes.

Many of the gifts will be gay and friendly—the sound
of bells or a Christmas carol, the flash of a cardinal outside
the window, even the scolding of a nutliatcli who disap-
proved of our tardiness in getting sunflower seeds on the
feeder.

These are some of the special gifts which arc'the promise
of the Christmas season. In accepting them we learn hu-
mility and new happiness.

May the joys of each succeeding season be yours through-
out the coming year. .,"',‘:

open land for recreation purposes.
Communities are already moving to ap-
ply for funds under the authorization.
Suffolk County is undertaking a $17,-
000,000 program acquisition of eight
thousand acres for public recreation
and wildlife habitat. The Long Island
State Park Commission approved plans
for a fifty-two-acre park on a peninsula
in Massapequa, Nassau County.

Ohio—Columbus voters approved $5,-
280,000 for parks and recreation facili-
ties by a 63.8 percent vote. Plans call
for construction of four recreation cen-
ters, three large playfields, fourteen
school-park sites, and other recreation
improvements.

Voters in Columbus and surrounding
Franklin County also gave 60.4 percent
approval to a three-tenths n1ill levy to
finance expansion of parks of the Co-
lumbus Metropolitan Park District. The
levy will provide approximately $4,600,-
000 in the decade.

According to Kenneth D. Campbell,
director of research and information for
the Development Committee of Greater
Columbus, this is “the largest park and
recreation package ever passed in Co-
lumbus but, according to studies by the
parks and recreation committee of the
Development Committee, will merely
make possible the restoration of the
area’s 1954 park acreage-population
ratio of 5.4 acres per thousand persons.
The parks and recreation committee
originally recommended the companion
measures and succeeded in persuading
the Metropolitan Committee of 100, a
volunteer organization which promotes
bond issues in the community, to spon-
sor the issue before the voters.”

Michigan—Garden City passed a
$550,000 bond issue for an outdoor
swimming pool, artificial ice rink, ten-
nis courts, and land acquisition.

In Grosse Pointe, voters approved
$165,000 for improving Neff Park with

“THINGS”

This issue of RECREATION is devoted to the “things” that make the rec-

reation job possible—the equipment, facilities, areas—but in our concern

with them let us not lose sight of the trained leadership necessary to make

the most of them and of the fact that “people are our business.”

Areas,

facilities, and equipment would be quite pointless without them.

 

an inland swimming pool and one hun-
dred boat wells. Issues in Dearborn,

Grosse Pointe Woods, and Madison
Heights failed to pass.

Louisiana—Taxpayers in Monroe ap-
proved, by a better than two-to-one vote,
$1,675,000 for recreation and a main-
tenance tax of one mill.

California—A whopping $1,750,000,-
000, one of the largest bond issues ever
authorized in the state, will finance a
vast water supply system, including
dams and aqueducts to carry surplus
water from the north to as far south as
San Diego. Called the Feather River
Project, it will surpass the cost of the
Tennessee Valley Authority.

F INCREASED POLLUTION of rivers, lakes,
and beaches, at a time when the demand
for water recreation opportunities are

ference on Water Pollution. The con-
ference, called by Surgeon-General Le-
roy E. Burney of the U. S. Public Health

F A FIVE-YEAR FEDERAL PROGRAM to aid
states and municipalities with their
juvenile delinquency programs will be
proposed in January by U. S. Senator

Jacob K. Javits of New York  In
announcing his bill the senator says, “It
will create a federal advisory council,
and authorize state advisory councils,
whose members would be public officials
dealing with youth problems, profes-
sional experts, and community leaders
experienced in the many fields which
concern delinquency.

“As a member of the subcommittee
on juvenile delinquency of the Senate
Committee on Labor and Public Wel-
fare, I consider action on such legisla-
tion imperative if we are to substan-

tially reduce juvenile delinquency in
America.”

F THE FIFTH ANNUAL MIDWEST Recrea-
tion School, cosponsored by the Uni-
versity of Kansas and the National
Recreation Association, has been an-
nounced for February 20-24, 1961 at
the Student University Building on Law-
rence Campus. Program subjects at
previous schools have both been stimu-
lating and diversified and the faculty
excellent. This year’s faculty will con-
sist of : W. C. Sutherland, director of
NBA Recreation Personnel Services;
Fay Brown, past-president of the Kansas
Parliamentarians; Professor William
Conboy, head of KU’s department of
speech and drama; John Ciele, KU in-
structor of sociology; Dr. Warren
Peterson, director of research on social
problems and education for Community

Studies Incorporated, Kansas City,
Missouri.

From the last school comes the fol-
lowing bit of phiIOSOphy, dedicated to
the recreation volunteer by G. L.
Palmer, director of recreation in Ex-
celsior Springs, Missouri: “You are
working in the finest work there is. Your
pay is the very best (service to others
is happiness). There is no problem of
raises, your take-home pay doubles each
day; there is no withholding tax, you
get it all; and your social security is
paid with the respect of your fellowman.
Your only requirement is good conduct.
A bit of you will rub off on those you
serve. Be sure this is always goodness.
God smiles on you, your community

admires you, the kids revere you, and
we thank you.”

'county medical society

F The fact that curbs on football for
smaller boys are being urged by the
Westchester County, New York, medi-
cal profession was played up in a recent
issue of The New Y ark Times. An edi-
torial in the November bulletin of the
declared that
“the medical problem . . . is enhanced
enormously when undeveloped muscles
and unfused epiphyses (the unattached
ends of a long bone, at which growth
originates) are subject to twisting
stresses and untutored impact.”

The editorial anticipated that coaches
'or sponsors of some “midget” football
programs might argue that the lack of
strength and weight in the ten-to-twelve-
year-olds lessened the incidence of in-
jury. The doctors reply, however, that
“one permanent deformity as a result of
such activity is an unwarranted risk.”

the maintenance of high standards in

thirty-three to thirty-five percent of the
total magazines and small book sales in
chain groceries. According to a recent
survey, there are now 142,000 retail
magazine outlets of all descriptions in
the United States and Canada. This is
12,300 more than shown in a 1959
survey.

A total of 4,100 new supermarkets
has been added since the 1959 survey
was made, bringing the total number of
supermarket magazine outlets to 19,600.
These include independent supermar-
kets as well as chain stores.

F FIT FOR TRAVEL? As the time when
we will send a man into space grows
nearer, we think once again of the ter-
rifically important part that fitness—
mental, emotional, spiritual, and ph si-
cal—will play in the success of such a
venture. The astronaut’s family must
attain a high degree of fitness as well
because they are, and will bc, immedi-
ately concerned with implementing his
part in the project and with his eventual
survival.

One of the pioneers in space in sur-
vival, Dr. George Mangun, has come up
with another intcresting observation, in
a recent issue of Sports Illustrated. He
remarks that one of the major problems
of space travel will bc to provide the
traveler with sufiicient opportunity for
exercise. (There it is, fitness again.)
He quotcs a psychiatrist as saying,

“Games that require a reasonab'
amount of exercise and include the O]
portunity to hit something can help I
relieve both tension and anxiety.” HOV
ever, the good doctor added, lest twitch
patients-—and the nations of the wo-rl
—take to cui’ring each other with to
much enthusiasm, it is important th:
the games be played “just [or fan.”

F THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON Tn
AGING completed plans at its tenth a1
niversary meeting to operate as a ne

Aging, as it will be known, will be a
afiiliate of the assembly.

F WRITING for the National Associatio
for Mental Health, Edith Stern poin
out that mental health covers more the
staying clear of a mental institutio:
“It is,” she says, “taking things as th!
are, not as you hOped, fooled yourSel
or thought they would be. It is reco;
nizing obstacles to happiness, then fin:
ing other ways to enjoy life. It is d
liberater and intelligently thinkir
through how to get the most out of li-
ing and then acting upon the decisior
you reach. It is managing your feeling
and actions in the way that keeps ya
the most comfortable with yourself an
with others.”

If we think of mental health in the:
terms, there must be millions of oldste:
today who, though confused . . . hm
thus far managed to stay clear of
mental institution. To enablc them I
rcmain outside institutional care is
real challenge to all of us that cannu
lightly be put aside—Today’s Health.

RECREATIO

The

New
Frontier

has already given some thought

to the place of recreation in “The
New Frontier.” Two of his special con-
cerns are discussed here.

President-elect John F. Kennedy

A Matter of Urgency

“Recreation resources are a problem that can’t wait,” he
has stated. He has insisted that we need a whole new con-
cept of resource development, and comments, “Resource
conservation is our new frontier.”

In an article prepared for Field and Stream during his
United States senatorship, he wrote: “Recreation areas for
public use on the shores of our seacoasts, lakes, and gulfs
are disappearing at a rapid rate. The National Park Service
has repeatedly called upon the government for help with
that recreation resource for the benefit of the public. . .
Every year of delay in acquiring suitable areas will impose
ever greater costs on the public purse.

“The time for action to save our shoreline recreation
areas is already overdue. I have sponsored legislation to
acquire seashore areas and will make this program a prime
objective of my administration.

“The federal government, along with state and local gov-
ernments and private interests, has a responsibility to meet
the mounting recreation needs of the people of America,
including its millions of hunters and fishermen. . . . “The
Park Service’s Mission 66 program is behind schedule and
should be speeded. The Forest Service’s program for the
national forests has not been adequately implemented. We
need to be pursuing land-acquisition policies in connection
with new reservoirs which will make the most of their poten-
tial recreation values. . . .

“The Outdoor Recreational Resources Review Commis-
sion is now at work and will report in 1961. It is every-
one’s hope that it will outline wise federal policies and pro-
grams in all outdoor recreation fields. . . .

“We still can have an abudance of recreation opportuni-
ties in America. Resources are still available. But they will

DECEMBER 1960

 

soon be lost if we do not quickly go about conserving them
and seeing that renewable resources such as fish and game
are not only protected but increased to meet skyrocketing

needs.” The President-elect also supports the Senate bill

lo enlist a vast army of American youth into a Youth Con-
servation Corps to serve in the developing and protection
of our national resources.

Renaissance in the Arts

In answer to a questionnaire submitted by The Saturday
Review editors, Mr. Kennedy said that “The government
cannot order that culture exist, but the government can and
should provide the climate of freedom, deeper and wider
education, and intellectual curiosity in which culture Hour-
ishes.” He pointed out that the platform of the Democratic
party proposes a federal advisory agency “to assist in the

evaluation, development and expansion of cultural resources
of the United States.”

In relation to the National Cultural Center, he says, “The
National Cultural Center should be erected as speedily as
possible. The private contributions have been welcome and
helpful, and I hope will continue.” He further clarifies his
position as follows, “The encouragement of art, in the
broadest sense, is indeed a function of government. It has
always been so, in a tradition that extends from the most
glorious days of Greece. . . .

“Our philosophy is quite simple. When an organism
stops growincr, it starts dying. This is true for nations as
wcll as men, and for spirit and mind as well as material
things. I am determined . . . that there be an American
renaissance in which imagination, daring, and the creative

arts point the way.” #-

A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FUN

St. Louis boasts one of the largest

artificial refrigerated outdoor rinks in the nation.
The Steinberg Memorial Skating Rink was inspired
by the Wohlman Skating Rink in Central Park, New York.

Mrs. Edward Brungard

ICE SKATING is now the most popular
outdoor winter sport in St. Louis,

thanks to the beautiful Steinberg
Memorial Skating Rink. Before it was
built, the city had been averaging only
four to seven outdoor skating days each
season because of unpredictable winter
weather. Located in picturesque 1,380-
acre Forest Park, the huge rink can accommodate fifteen
hundred ice skaters at one time. When the turnstiles were
opened oflicially in November, 1957, 2,658 skaters took ad-
vantage of the opening season. The idea of donating such
a facility to the city of St. Louis was conceived by the wife
of the late Mark C. Steinberg when she saw the famed
Wohlman Skating Rink in Central Park on a trip to New
York several years ago. She realized that a rink of this sort
would be an ideal memorial to her husband, who died in
1951, as it combined his two great interests—sports and
youth—in one activity, and proceeded to make this rink pos-
sible. Under the terms of her husba nd’s will, the Steinberg
Charitable Trust was established, from which two-thirds of
the cost of the $935,000 skating rink was defrayed. The
city contributed the other one-third, which was obtained
from operating revenue and bond funds.

The rink is usually open for ice skating from November
first to April first, although the exact dates depend on
weather conditions. According to cngineers, the ice surface
will remain in a satisfactory condition until temperatures
reach sixty degrees, but elements such as the amount of
sunlight and humidity are also determining factors. During
the last three seasons, 650,000 skaters have used the rink.

This year it began its third ice skating season on “painted
ice,” which deflects the sun’s penetrating rays. The ice was
painted with a Zamboni ice conditioner which applied an
onion-skin layer of water-soluble, oil-free, white paint to
the first quarter inch layer of ice. Then, numerous layers of
ice were added to the painted surface. The day after the
paint was applied, and with one and a quarter inches of

ice thickness, the temperatures reached seventy-two degrees;
the ice remained in excellent condition.

One of the largest artificially refrigerated outdoor rinks
in the nation, the ice surface measures 120'-by-230'—
27,000 square feet of skating fun. Brine is pumped through
twenty-three miles of one-and-a-quarter inch pipe, im-
bedded in a monolithic concrete slab. To freeze the rink, a
four-hundred-ton centrifugal three-stage compressor made
by York Refrigeration Company is used, with Freon 12 as
the primary refrigerant.

To condition the ice after a skating session, ice shavings
are picked up by the Zamboni ice machine and shoveled
from its snow hopper into the River des Peres storm sewer
which is adjacent to the rink. (A door cut into the side of
the machine expedites removal of snow.) The numhcr of
ice shaving loads varies from one to five, depending on the
skating crowd and the hardness of the ice.

The rink, operated under the direction of the city de-
partment of parks and recreation, admits children under
twelve years free. and charges fifty cents admission for
teenagers and adults. The building provides free checking
facilities for fifteen hundred pairs of shoes. concessions
where skates may be rented, food and drinks purchased.

Activities

One of the highlights of the skating season is the family
night session conducted on Wednesday evenings from 6:30
to 8:00 P.M. This allows parents to skate with their children
during the week and have them home at an early hour.
The attendance at this session alone proves that a definite
recreation need was fulfilled in St. Louis with the building
of the rink. Three regular skating sessions are held daily,
and there are also speed and figure-skating sessions which
are extremely popular.

A special instruction program is now conducted for
children from the Missouri School for the Blind, in co-
operation with the Missouri Skating Association which
provides one instructor for each child.

During the summer months—June to the first week in
September—the monolithic concrete slab is coated with a
transparent plastic-like material, Denso Roller-Ware, con-
verting it for rollcr skatin". Thus. the rink provides year-
round recreation for St. Louis citizens. A Iota] of eighty-
eight thousand roller skaters attended sessions during the
first two summer sessions. #

RECREATION

Snowshoeing,
the

Quiet
Adventure

Roderick MacRae
WITH MY FEET propped up on the fireplace I was spin-

ning not-so-tall tales of the woods. My companions

were all skiers and their distinguishing mark was
a bandaged foot. My feet were still free and nimble for I do
not ski, I am a snowshoer. Most of the skiers thought I must
be crazy not to enjoy the swift, tingling schuss down the
mountainside. Let me tell you what I told the skiers about
the rewards of a slow trek through the winter woods.

I picked a back trail that meandered through them at a
gentle incline. There were no skiers to trip over. There
were, of course, deadfalls, but instead of tripping over them
I stopped. I stopped to enjoy a world not many pe0ple take
time to see—the intricate world of nature in the crackling
beauty of thirty below zero and ten feet of snow. There were
many things alive in this cold world. The first I met was a
small fieldmouse. He was not the “sleekit, cowrin’ beastie”
of Burns’ famous ode but a very brave and determined little
mouse. He stood on a mountain of ice and snow that deli-
cately enveloped the door to his den and chewed me out in
no uncertain terms for daring to disturb him. He finally de-
cided that I, the intruder, was acceptable and proceeded
about his business.

Down the trail I came upon a vastly different scene. Here
nature had not been so gentle; for in the center of the trail
were signs of death. A deer had come out of the woods from
the north; a wolf had been prowling up from the south.
The two had met in a surprised fury in the brittle morning
haze. There was, now, only a little blood upon the tracks.

Here and there were little mantles of snow and ice hang-
ing defiantly over the banks. Occasionally, a Lilliputian
avalanche would dislodge a cliff of snow and topple it into
the water. By some miracle the snow does not melt in the
chilly water but continues downstream soon to fuse with an-
other iceflow to create a brave little iceberg.

At thirty below a snowfall in the woods is different from
the rakish snowstorm of the city. At that temperature the
snowflake becomes a feather. It does not really “fall” but
lives in a state of suspended animation, drifting, not aim-
lessly for its fall is purposeful, until it decides to rest upon
a branch. Soon it is joined by other flakes, but the flakes
do not melt and fuse as they do on city streets. They may.
at any time, decide to pick themselves up again and drift

with the chilly frost. Those that stay form an ermine coat
upon the softer balsam boughs.

ARE THESE sights into a world beyond the reach of most
of us? Is it a paradise too far removed to be visited on
our few weekend journeys beyond the city’s walls? Is thirty
degrees below zero so abrasive a cold that man must cringe
by a fireplace? Not at all. Almost all these sights can be
reached in less than a day’s journey from your home. For
example, we might take a Sunday afternoon drive into the
country. We come to a farm with several acres of undis-
turbed woodland and a frozen creek bed. Now, if this were
hunting season, chances are that we would stop and ask the
farmer if we could use his land. Let’s do the same today.
This mystic winter world will not unfold magically before
your eyes; you must look for it; you must stop and listen.
Soon you will see the mice, the birds, and the other winter
animals going about their business. You may hear the gen-
tle crunch-crunch of a squirrel having lunch. You will have
to watch carefully lest you crush with your giant shoeprint
the tiny four-pawed track so delicately imprinted on the
crusty surface of the snow.

The other skill needed is the ability to walk. Surprisingly,
man is not always so adept at this basic skill. Walking does
not mean dragging the feet; it does not mean sticking the
hands in the pockets and sauntering. It does mean taking
high, proud steps, lifting the feet; it means throwing out
your chest and breathing clean air; it means keeping alert.

There is no great skill needed for snowshoeing as a week-
end pastime for the family. There is, of course, a great deal
of skill needed for long treks on shoes; but for our explora-
tion journeys we need only the basic skill of walking.

But whatever manner you choose to take a journey into
the winter woods should prove satisfying. It will be a world
that was once known to our grandparents who took time to
look about them. It has strangely been lost to us not only in
the hustle and bustle of the city but also in the rush of fast

sports. #

define the qualifications of those who
would be directing the recreation activi-
ties at the completed facilities.

The committees made studies and
recommendations for a specific pro-
gram of recreation facilities in the fol-
lowing categories: playground club-
houses, sports fields and play courts,
family picnic areas, beach development,
oldsters’ centers, small children’s play
areas, swimming pools, shelters and
pergolas, and sanitary conveniences.
Each chairman was asked to form his
own committee with representatives
from several divisions and subdivisions
of the recreation department, such as
plant nursery, maintenance, personnel,
caretakers, recreation directors, and
planners.

These committees outlined their par-
ticular problem, analyzed nearby rec-
reation facilities, consulted written ma-
terials, talked to inf0rmed persons, and
gave considerable thought to the devel-
opment of original and functional de-
signs. Each committee then wrote spe-
cific recommendations for program
activities as well as a description of the
facility in detail. For example, the com-
mittee on playground clubhouse build-
ings included in its recommendations:
number and size of rooms, requirc-
ments for ceiling, wall, and floor; loca-

tion of heating equipment; desirability

of play porches. Often, drawings of
floor plans and details were provided.

These reports were presented to the
superintendent of park development,
who supervised and directed the plan-
ning. His staff prepared an analysis of
each report and developed a composite
facility so the landscape architect, ar-
chitect, site planner, or engineer devel-
oping plans for an entire facility would
have a complete set of directions.

The staff’s work did not end here,
however. A workable formula was de-
veloped with the first architectural pro j-
ects assigned. When preliminary plans
are presented by the architect they are
reviewed by the recreation staff, the
planners, and those responsible for ev-
eryday maintenance and repair. The
plans then return to the planning staff
for further consultation with the archi-
tect. This procedure is repeated with
each third of the work completed. Offi-
cial approvals by the board of commis-
sioners are secured at each stage of
planning after the preliminaries have
been prepared. Whenever a community
group requests, plans are shown to the
interested parties. Similarly, when dif-
ferences of opinion exist, the plans are
shown so that modifications can be
made. In some communities all new
plans are displayed at meetings set up
locally for that purpose. 0

In the beginning, one of the most
difficult, but most important, tasks was
establishing priorities for the develop-
ment program. It was decided that all
necessary land be acquired immediately
so that spiraling land costs would not
devaluate the bond dollars and the
areas would not be developed for other
uses. In many cases, the tempo of land
acquisition determined the development
program, and some projects were de-
layed by slow negotiations or condem-
nation proceedings.

Some other criteria for establishing
development priorities were: commu-

nity need and interests, interest of
elected officials, availability of bond
funds, ease of scheduling work, rela-
tionships to other improvements such
as streets, utilities, freeways, and so
forth. By breaking down each project
into dcfinite units, it was possible to
proceed with the forty-lnillion-dollar de-
velopment program in orderly fashion.

This procedure allowed the persons
who would be operating the facilities
and, thus, have a great stake in the final
result, also to have a voice in preparing
the plans. Experience has provcn that
this method of preparation, interpreta-
tion, and review has been efficient for
planning the expenditure of public funds
for recreation and park facilities. #

PROPER SELECTION of paving or sur-
facing materials for specific uses
on playgrounds is possibly the most im-
portant single factor in determining
construction and maintenance costs,
safety and play characteristics, and the
esthetic qualities of the finished facility.
Each available material has its own
characteristics, and the question is not which is right or
wrong, but which will fulfill the intended purpose.

What would make the most satisfactory tennis-eourt sur-
faeewgrass, concrete, elay, bituminous or asphaltie emul-
sion? Obviously there are as many possible answers as there
are categories or variations within the eategories, and the
proper selection is a matter of personal judgment based on
budgetary requirements and the type of activity desired.
These same questions could be asked in the choice of surfac-
ing materials for other playground areas. Cinder screenings
have been used in place of turf on intensively used athletic
fields; many sections of the country use bituminous surfac-
ing under children’s play equipment.

Over a period of years, the Philadelphia Department of
Recreation has thoroughly investigated every known prod-

uet or material which might be suitable for playground sur-
facing. This investigation has covered hard surfacing of all
types, as well as sand, sawdust, woodchips, tanbark, various
grasses, rubberized bituminous paving, interlocking rubber
matting, roll bituminous material with cane-fiber aggregate.
and many others. The following materials are the ones
found most practical for specific playground areas:

Concrete l’aviangMost successful for basketball, volleyball.
badminton, deck tennis, and shufllcboard courts, as well as
for drainage channels and walkways. One of the most per-
manent and versatile of the hard surfaces, concrete can be
placed with extreme accuracy. Drainage channels with in-
tegral curbing and areas where excessive abrasion ean oceur
demand this material. Paving with less than a one percent
ingredient will drain effectively and rapidly with no stand-
ing water. The surface treatment can be varied from smooth
to extremely rough which has obvious functional advantages
for outdoor dancing areas, sliuflleboard courts, or ramps.
Precast paving blocks can be used advantageously in re-
stricted areas or to achieve a textural quality for esthetie
effects. The major disadvantage is its unyielding and nor-
mally abrasive surface, which makes injuries or eontusions
from falls more severe than with other materials. Necessary
expansion joints can cause interference with some activities:
proper installation and curing are mandatory for satisfac-

Raeuearim

tory results; minor repairs are difficult to make.

Fine Aggregate Bituminous Paving—For general play areas
and court game areas where extremely concentrated use is
not expected. Another versatile material, it has been used
more frequently than any other for playground surfacing.
Relatively inexpensive, it is easily and quickly installed,
easily repaved, plastic in nature, somewhat resilient, and
homogenous in appearance. It can be laid directly on well-
drained subsoil or on various thicknesses and sizes of base
stone which can be either penetrated or waterbound. The
aggregate mixture can be varied from very fine to extremely
coarse. The asphaltic binder can be varied and is made
plastic by heat or chemical cutbacks. For general play-
ground use, where only light vehicular traflic is encountered,
Philadelphia utilizes a section consisting of a six-inch water-
bound base-stone course, and a two-course bituminous sur-

face. The top three-quarter inch is a hot-mix fine aggregate
material.

Limitations are equally important to consider. Abrasion
such as that encountered beneath basketball backboards is
severe, and deterioration of the paving can be rapid. Sub-
soil stability is extremely important and base stone is neces-
sary for permanency. Installation and rolling must be care-
fully supervised to produce an even and substantial paving.
Softening in hot weather can be troublesome. Dimensional
accuracy is more difficult to control than in some other pav-

ing materials, and roller marks, bird baths, and other im-
perfections are the rule rather than the exception in areas
without a gradient of at least two percent. In confined,
oddly shaped areas or areas with obstructions, it may be
more expensive than other, more permanent materials. In
recent years experiments have led to inclusion of rubber
chips and other resilient materials into the surface course.
Experience has shown these materials are quickly worn away
in areas where they are most needed. Installation is also
somewhat expensive compared to alternate methods.

Coarse Aggregate Bituminous Paving—Best for parking
areas. Its relatively low cost, easy installation, and perma-
nence make is admirably suited for use in open expanses;
and its installation relieves many problems that attend un-
paved areas, such as weeds, ruts, dust, and debris. Care
should be taken to completely treat the subsurface with a
weed killer before installing the material.

Emulsified Asphalt Paving—Exclusively for tennis court
paving. This can be laid with more accuracy than concrete,
and minor imperfections can be corrected with ease. Lack of
expansion joints and its variety of surface colors and treat-
ments make it desirable from an esthetic and functional
standpoint and degrees of resiliency can be obtained by us-
ing various aggregates. Control and supervision must be
exercised when used on playing courts, however, since abra-

The Griper

 

Let us not forget that, in recreation,
people are our job. . . .

The People We Meet

Sclwyn Orcutt

F WE, THE recreation administrators
I and leaders of today, assume the
challenge that is ours, it is time that
we take inventory of the people as well
as the areas that we are to serve. It
may be a consolation when you are dis-
couraged with local folks, and think
that your community is not behind your
program as much as it should be, to
find that the same types of problem per-
sonalitics exist in any city. It is up to
you, and me, to find cvcr hetter ways of
pleasing, serving, and working with dif-
ficult people. We must apply ourselves
to learning their weaknesses and their
strengths.
Among the various types that l have
found on my doorstcp are:
The Criper—Nothing is right in his es-
timation. He cannot understand why we
have a recreation department because
he is getting nothing from it personally,
and he cannot understand where the
taxpayer’s money is going. The first
tendency that we have when meeting
such a person is to retreat; but, if we
are prepared with the right answcrs, we
can certainly give him something to
think about. We must have the patience
to learn more about him; we should
make it a point to go into his back-
ground, his interests, activities, and so
on. to see whether recreation is reach-

ing his family or himself in any way.
The Inferior Soul—The man with the
inferiority complex is oftcn found in
the poorer and more underprivileged
families, in mill sections, slum areas,
but throughout the community as well.
We can help him gain confidence by in-
cluding him in our planning groups and
in activities with other types of persons
in our community, to help him build up
a respect for his own abilities.

The Talker—This type talks a lot but
does nothing. Sometimes we find him
heading the various organizations but
actually not doing anything construc-
tive. If we would personally spend
some time with him to give him the
foundation and insight he needs for
constructive leadership, he could be ex-
tremely useful to the department.

The Newly Rich—This guy is so busy
thinking of making money that he can-
not bother to think of donating any-
thing to the community. One approach
to this type might be to show him how
he may gain addcd recognition by offer-
ing financial support to our projects.
The Organ izer—Sooncr or later. we are
apt to run into the individual who is
always trying to organize every kind of
activity, usually with very little experi-
ence in doing so. lf we work to curb
his tendency to gel himself into too
many things and center his attention on
those most suited to his skills and ex-
perience, we can promote many good

 

he Organizer

activities through him.

The Sophisticate—This man too often
“looks down his nose” at public recre-
ation as being too juvenile for his taste.
He is often, but not always, rich and
therefore inclined to confine his activi-
ties to the country club, his estate, or
commercial recreation. The best ap-
proach to him and his ilk is through
the cultural or more intellectual activi-
ties which might bc conducted by the
recreation department. He can certainly
be an asset to the program if he can be
reached and made aware of his commu-
nity responsibilitics.

The Character—He is found in any lo-
cality. He maybe the person who seems
to be down on his luck but is cheery
just the same; the folksy, “homespun”
type, or just “different.” When we ana-
lyze all of these types. possibly this one
enjoys life best with the least. ll be-
hooves all of our workers to try to help
all those down on their luck as much as
possible and to derive strength from the
spirit of checrfulness they exhibit.

The Volunteer—Here is the backbone
of a successful recreation program. He
is the one who givcs of his talents
freely; and we must keep him inspired.
show him, in every way, that we appre-
ciate his eontrilmtions of help and skill.

COORDINATION 0? these and many
other types of people is our job.
We must take into consideration the
character weaknesses of cach and weigh
them against his character strengths.
If we are to forge ahead. we will have
to understand this, and to take advan-
tage of the skills and strengths of our
volunteers. People are the fundamental
factors involved in our profession.

RECREATION

From the White House Conference on Children and Youth

as delivered at the 42nd National Recreation Congress in Washington, D. C.

Ten Challenges to Program

Virginia Musselman

MORE THAN twenty-four hundred
years ago, Socrates stood before
an Athenian crowd and said, “Citizens
of Athens, why is it that you turn and
scrape every stone to gather wealth, and
neglect your children to whom, one day,
you must relinquish it all?” This cry
is not a new cry. It has echoed, and
will continue to echo, down the mountains and over the
plains of every nation. It is the heartbeat of the world. If
concern for children should stop, there would be no need
of an atomic bomb to destroy us. We shall have destroyed
ourselves.

The 1960 White House Conference on Children and

Youth gave me the unique opportunity of going over all

 

the evaluation reports of the states, territories, possessions,
and national organizations. My ob was to summarize and
evaluate what was reported on free time, leisure, and rec-
reation, including libraries and mass media. Those reports
came in every size and shape. Some were in hand-tooled
leather; some in simple mimeographed sheets; but in them
was the whole panorama of our country.

They were so honest—those reports. There was no at-
tempt to gloss over the failures; they took simple credit
for the tremendous advances that had been made; they
listed frankly what had not been accomplished and what
needed to be done. Anyone who feels the least bit cynical
about the state of the nation, its national objectives, its
hopes, its dreams, its state of health, should have the chance
to read those reports. They represent the conscience of a
nation.

We all have far too few opportunities to study the forces
that affect the future of our children and youth as a whole.
It is so easy to become so involved in one agency, one pro-
gram, one community that we see only the individual pieces
of the vast mosaic instead of the finished picture. We all
know, intellectually, that the health of the child, his educa-
tion, his family, his religious training, the group he plays
with, the books he reads, the movies and television he sees,
the neighborhood and community in which he lives all go
into that child. We do not always act on this knowledge,
however, and this becomes a real challenge to program.

sociation Program Service.

DECEMBER 1960

Many Challenges in One

Many of the state and national agencies mentioned the
unevenness of services—some lucky places, some lucky
groups getting wonderful opportunities, others getting little
or nothing. This holds true right down to local neighbor-
hoods and right up to state-provided programs. It holds
true in the types of leadership, and the facilities and equip-
ment provided. Challenge 1, therefore, is the Challenge of
Distribution.

Another weakness, mentioned over and over in many of
the reports, is the failure to provide adequate programs for
girls, for young married couples, for ethnic groups, particu-
larly the Negro and the Spanish-speaking groups. Many of
the Western states also included the American Indians, both
on and off reservations, over half of whom are under nine-
teen years of age. These young pe0ple are caught between
two cultures, unable to accept completely the culture of their
grandparents and not welcomed into the culture of the white
man. The second challenge, then, might be called the Chal-
lenge of the Minorities, whether it be the minority of sex,
race, language or interests.

A third weakness, and one running prominently through
most of the reports, was the failure to provide programs for
the family as a unit. Recreation programs were accused
of separating families, rather than bringing them together.
Very few oifered anything very definite in family recrea-
tion. If the family is invited as a unit, it is usually divided
and age groups go their own way; or else the program is
merely entertainment, where parents watch and children
perform. Challenge III, then, is the Challenge of the Fan:-
ily. Family education for recreation is a fundamental need.

Many of the states and many agencies pointed out what
we all know—the need for recreation programs for the hand-
icapped. North Carolina, among other states, specifically
mentioned children and youth in hospitals, correctional in-
stitutions, children’s homes, and those mentally or physi-'
cally handicapped; and they are legion. Challenge IV, then,
is the Challenge of the Unfortunates, the hidden groups,
with us, but all too often not of us.

Many states reported an over-emphasis 011 a few sports,
particularly baseball, football, and basketball, to the neglect
of really good, long-term instruction in the individual
sports. They complained that schools, recreation depart-
ments, and youth-serving agencies duplicate each other; that
thousands of youngsters, who for any reason are not inter-

467

ested in those sports, find very few opportunities in which
they might have a real interest. Bowling, archery, soccer,
track and field, tennis, sailing, canoeing, horseback riding,
skating, skiing, fencing are all in our programs to some
degree but are not made as p0pular or given as much glam-
or and acclaim. Challenge V, then, is Sports—not the few
for the few, but the many for the many.

Closely allied with the above is the lack of physical ac-
tivities that offer a personal challenge.

Where can boys and girls in their teens or early twenties
or any age for that matter find anything to do these days
that’s adventurous, daring, and a little bit dangerous? Ev-
eryone has an instinctive need, at some period in his life,
to find out what sort of person he is under stress, to fight
natural forces.

Many are convinced that this unsatisfied need is behind
the increasing popularity of skin-diving, water-skiing, quar-
ter midget racing, drag strips, motorcycling, motor boating,
etcetera. None of our nice, legitimate games, played with
specific rules in specific limits, fills this primitive need.
Camping doesn’t always fill it; in fact for the failure of
camping to hold the teenager is that camping has become
too soft, too safe, too easy. How many youngsters get the
chance and are taught how to meet a personal, physical cri-
sis? Challenge VI—and a big one—is the Challenge of
Adventure.

MOST STATES mentioned the big jump in attendance at
state parks and forests, and their efforts to provide
more tent and trailer areas, shelters, lodges, trails, nature
museums and so on. This burst of enthusiasm for traveling
emphasizes the need for much earlier, much more intensive
programs on what we used to call nature but what is now
being called physical science.

Interest in, and a liking for, the great outdoors must be
started early when children’s curiosity about the world
around them is at its strongest. It is then that the beginnings
of adventure can start, as the youngster learns how to be
comfortable in and to enjoy the forests, waters, mountains,
plains, and deserts. Anemic, make-believe programs in day
camping, all too often merely transposed playground pro-
grams, cushioned, soft, with no follow-through do very little
to stimulate the thrill of the out-of-doors.

Demonstrations, exhibits, weekend workshops have
sprung up, but learning how to light a primus stove, set
up a tent and inflate a sleeping bag is not knowing how to
enjoy camping. Why are we so afraid of family education
for recreation, not just in the camping area, but in all forms
of free-time activities that family groups can learn together?
Why do we shy away from science programs, where what is
learned in formal education can be applied to informal rec-
reation interests?

Call it what you will, Challenge VII is the Challenge of
the Wild, and if we want to preserve our wilderness areas,
we had better meet that challenge. (See also Page 476.)

One of the most often-stated criticism of the statcs and
national agencies is the lack of, or inadequacy of, creative,
cultural activities. Literally millions of children and youth

468

have never seen a live play, listened to a live concert, seen
a great painting or piece of sculpture, read or heard or
written poetry, seen an opera, played any form of musical
instrument. Too few have had any creative outlet in paint-
ing, dancing, drama, or music. Too many receive their only
art experience through the programs they watch passively
on television.

Perhaps this is tied up with another feeling expressed in
the reports—that recreation agencies, both public and pri-
vate, seem to lack fully stated and fully understood objec-
tives. Programs in the cultural activities tend to be hit—or-
miss; long-term, well-organized plans with specific objec-
tives are a rarity. The State of Utah noted, “We offer chil-
dren a tremendous flurry of very dead stuff.” Challenge

VIII is therefore the Challenge of Community Culture.

THE TIME has come———make no mistake about it-—when
we must take a cold, objective look at our communi-
ties and ourselves. We must cut off the dead branches of any
programs that have been allowed to get out of hand and
graft new programs that will fulfill our long-range objec-
tives. No agency, public or private, can afford to work alone
in this age of ever-increasing resistence to tax hikes and
voluntary giving.

Quantity must give way to quality. Constant, sober eval-
uation, and analysis is imperative. It does not nccessarily
follow that if five playgrounds are a good thing, ten will
be evcn better. It does not necessarily follow that a town
without a year-round program should spend thousands of
dollars on a summer program. It is quite possible that in
some places playgrounds as they are conducted have lost
thcir usefulness and their programs should be drastically
cliangcd. Wc should accept no established concept unless it
stands up under critical analysis.

Throughout every evaluation report sent in to the White
House Conference ran the repcatcd recommendation for
more and better coordination between all community agen-
cies serving children and youth. Lack of joint planning,
duplications of facilities, leadership and programs, lack of
policies for joint use of facilities wcre all cited as weak-
ncsses throughout the nation. Some of these weaknesses
came from the inadequacy of our present use of mass media
to awaken public interest in, and better understanding of.
leisure; failure to inform the public more effectively as to
existing opportunities, and failure to enlist their support.
The real basis of these weaknesses is fundamentally the fail-
are to have worked out specific, long-range objectives for
our activity program, and the resulting failure to involve
both youth and adults in setting up and carrying out these
objcctivcs. Cliallcngc IX might be called the Challenge of
Joining Hands—the challenge of working for the good of
the community, not just the good of a (lcparttnent or agency.
wlictlier public or private.

E COME now to the last challenge—and tlic scvercst in-
dictment of rccrcation programs. As it appeared in

Dear Santa,
I want a doll for my sister
Donna.
Ernest

IIE BRIEF LETTER above is one of
T literally thousands mailed in the

six Santa Claus mailboxes dis-
tributed throughout the city of Pensa-
cola, Florida, at Christmastime. Just
one such heartwarming request makes
the city’s Santa Claus mailbox program
worthwhile. The fruits of this simple,
inexpensive idea have been immeasur-
able. The city rccreation board has
continued sponsoring the mailbox pro-
gram since 1950 with cooperation of
the Pensacola News Journal.

Construction was simple. Total cost
was less than $100, of which the major
portion was for the painting. Copied
after regular mailboxes, the wooden re-
ceptacles, 24”-by-24~”-by-24~”, have slop-
ing fronts and two-inch pipe bases.
They were built by members of the
city’s parks division, who also set them
out each year. Two of the six boxes
have metal bases and are portable. They
can be placed on paved sites and can
also travel from school to school, with
the arrival times announced in advance.
Put up the first week in December, the
mailboxes remain up until one or two
weeks before Christmas.

The program is dependent upon pub-
licity and the News-Journal, always
ready to cooperate with the recreation
board in publicizing its activities, has
matched the department’s enthusiasm
for this project. Each night during the
season the padlocks on the various mail-
boxes are unlocked and the hoard of
mail returned to the recreation office.

The letters are funny, selfish, gener-

ous or heartwarming, but are always
written in earnest. Quite a few of them
are stamped, and some even contain
money, usually a few pennies a child
wants to put as a down payment, to as-
sure Santa’s appearance. Such money
is turned over to the youth centers.
The enthusiasm and anxiety with
which children anticipate Christmas is
seen in the letters, as is their thought-

 

fulness and generosity toward others.
What can be more sincere than a simple
letter from two brothers, who say,
“Please bring us a bicycle each. That’s
all we’re asking for because we don’t
want to be selfish. Bring my baby sister

We’ll

a musical rocker and a doll.
leave our door open in case you can’t
get the bikes down the chimney. \Ve
will be good boys.”

Sometimes‘the k.ids remind Santa of
what he didn’t bring last year, and one
little girl told him, “Thank you for the
toys that you sent me last Christmas. 1
am seven years old and would like to
have a doll that is called ‘dollikins,’ a
pair of bedroom shoes, a brownie suit,
or some doll clothes. Please don’t for-
get to take some toys and clothes to the
poor children. We will leave something
for you to eat.”

Parents, too, use the Santa mail-
boxes, and a variety of “mail” turns up

 

—from personal letters which wander
in by accident, to utility bills, which
look as though they had been dropped
off in the hope that Santa would pick up
the tab. Very rarely have any “crank”
letters shown up and never has there
been even one bit of vandalism.

The recreation department has had a
number of offers from commercial or-
ganizations to sponsor the program, but
these have all been discouraged. Even
the newspaper’s generous offer to give
a bicycle to the outstanding letter was
refused. To keep the letter program in-
formal and spontaneous, it must remain
entirely in the hands of the children.

The recreation board receives many
compliments on the colorful red-white-
and-green boxes each year, and, with
the city’s expansion, it is likely that
more boxes will be made. When thc
program ends, all letters are burned,
and, although it is necessary, everyone
concerned feels a trifle sad. One match
puts the final touch to thousands of
words that have been slowly, deliber-
ately, and hopefully printed on every
kind of paper, from five-dollar station-
ery to brown paper bags by youngsters
who still believe there is a Santa

Claus. #

l- ‘i 'I' *

Other Santa Claus Letters

It is interesting to see how the rec-
reation departments in different com-
munities handle “Dear Santa” letters.
In Bayonne, New Jersey, for example,
letters from special North Pole mail-
boxes are forwarded to the department
of parks office. Appropriate ansWers are
sent to the children and a prize is given
for the best letters from each grade.

In Mount Vernon, New York, on the
other hand, the letters are forwarded to
teenagers, who acknowledge their re-
ceipt by Santa. In many cases, where
the letters are especially sad, they are
forwarded to the proper city agencies.

RECREATION

The Plus Factor

Curtis H. Krishef

HE RETARDED NEED skilled recrea-
T tion help, skilled assistance in

learning how to relax, how to
enjoy being with others, and how to
have just plain fun. A training pro-
gram in work habits is important; so
is formal education up to the optimum
of his individual ability; but another
plus factor—recreation know-how—is
necessary to help the retardate make a
successful social adjustment in the com-
munity. The presence or absence of this
plus factor of recreation often makes
the difference between a happy, socializ-
ing person and a shy, withdrawn, un-
happy person.

Many a retardate discharged from in-
stitutions fails to make an adequate
community adjustment, not because he
is unable to work on a job, not because
he does not have the ability to get along
in the community, but simply because,
when through with a day’s work, he has
no knowledge of how or where to spend
his time. The retarded person has diffi-
culty in mixing with other people in a
social situation; many have never had
the opportunity to learn how to enjoy
their unoccupied hours.

Bob, whom I had occasion to work
with in Minneapolis, was discharged to
a public residential center after many
years of institutionalization. He was
able to find work and, although the ad-
justment from institution to community
living was not easy, he seemed to be
making a go of it. Then, one day he
came in to say he wanted to go back
to the institution. He didn’t mind the
work; he liked living at home; but he
did not know how to go about making
new friends and knew no place to go
when he was finished with work. At the
institution he had friends, peoplc to

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

Leisure-time activities help the retarded
to cross the bridge

whom he could talk. This was not true
now. He had thought it over, decided
to quit everything—and go back.
Bob’s verbalization of his feeling of
loneliness led to the formation of the
“Fun Club” at one of the Minneapolis
settlement houses. Bob was one of the
earliest members of the “Fun Club,”
organized to help young adults like
himself. I met him frequently at the
club and at my office during the months
after he had said he had had enough of
city living and wanted to go back to the
institution. I saw remarkable changes
in him, most of which I am confident
could be attributed to his new-found en-
j oyment of his leisure time. “The Fun
Club is the best thing,” he said onc day,
and as we talked I saw that the loncli-
ness he had felt had almost disappeared.
He had found new friends, he enjoyed
the get-togethers, he was enjoying his

life.

THE RETARDED person necds to hc ed-
ucated in recreation. Even thosc
so severely handicapped as to require
institutional care can benefit from thc
experiencc a good recreation program
can providc. The retardate, like anyone
clse, needs to learn how to let go, fccl
comfortable, and be relaxed in a social
situation. To thc staff of the institution
and collaborating agencies in the com-
munity, this goal should be as impor-

The recreation lcader can do much
to relieve some of the tensions engen-
dered by the competitive society in
which both we and those who are re-

moting individual competition, the wise

approach nlorc appropriate in many in-
stances, becausc it tends to relieve the
individual of singleness of conipctition

to the community

and brings the retardate into a group.
Like the rest of us, the retardate enjoys
sharing himself with the group to which
he feels he belongs.

The recreation leader can do much to
help retarded children and adults over-
come the frustrations they encounter in
the everyday world. The retarded need
a great deal of acceptance, approval,
encouragement, patience, and attention.
They need these things because they
cannot succeed as accomplished busi-
ness men, skilled craftsmen, bank presi-
dents, or store owners. 'T hey cannot
bccome professional people or social-
ites climbing the success ladder. Their
futures are limited.

Mo‘St of us are encouraged by our
little successes. We like to feel that our
competitors or co-workers look up to us.
The more wc progress. the more recog-
nition and attention we receive. This
can’t happen to those whose potential
for success is limited. Yet this need
to enjoy success is not lacking in the
retarded, and it is a need that recreation
people can fulfill. A pat on thc back
for Jimmy while he is having fun, or an
encouraging smile, can do more for him
in the span of ten seconds than many
other types of therapy. In the final
analysis. it is the spirit of good will and
active participation that makes a rec-
rcation program or any othcr thcrapeu-
tic endeavor a reality.

THE SWORD facing recreation person-

LOW MAINTENANCE
LANDSCAPE DESIGN

H ow to hold down costs and still achieve satisfying results

Milton Baron

ASIC LANDSCAPE DESIGN must always consider the prob-
B lems of maintenance, and be kept as simple as pos-
sible. “Over design” results in poorly kept areas,

poor public appreciation, and vandalism. Since mainte-
nance-free areas are nonexistent, design must be in practical
relationship with manpower and equipment. Usually there
is a direct relationship between original cost and subsequent
maintenance cost; the lower the first cost, the higher later
costs and vice versa. The use of the best materials, methods,

and construction will save money later. The following are
important considerations:

Architectural Materials—Utilize materials which maintain
themselves or withstand neglect. Avoid large glass areas,
enamel or porcelain materials in structures.

Buildings—Use brick or stone rather than paint.
Roads—Use blackt0p or concrete rather than stabilized
gravel or sandy clay.

Paths—Must be adequate for purpose and traffic. Use black-
top, concrete, or heavy stone chips; avoid loose gravel, tan-

bark.

Steps—Use concrete, stone, or brick; avoid wood or timber.

Posts—Use stone, concrete or metal (wood only above
grade).

scape architect at Michigan State University. This material
was presented at the 13th Annual Great Lakes Park Training

Institute.

Utilities:

Location—Keep easements on property lines. All utility
lines should enter building at one point, allowing a mechan-
ical room or core to be in one place. Utility lines should be
placed under roads ( in housing) and be easy to find and re-
pair. This makes for less interference with trees and ir-
replaceable landscape features. Valve boxes and other con-
trols must be in accessible places, are best in or at edge of
roads, walks, or drives.

Storm lines—Use 10-inch lines 1 minimum size for self clean-
ing) .

Catch basins—Use 48-inch diameter basin (for mechanical
cleaning).

Drain inlets—Use large sizes (self-cleaning).

Lawn drains—Place ring of sod around edge to stabilize soil
and prevent silting.

Surface runoff—Get rid of surface water, if pOssible. with-
out any structures (less original cost, less maintenance).
Irrigation—Provide hose bibs on building. Provide a mini-
mum system, a main line at least; an automatic system is
better.

Roof drainage—Either locate downspout on a separate
storm water system or use splash panel and sod.
Rubbish—Supply ample small outside wastepaper baskets,
tank-type rubbish containers at service docks. incinerators
and garbage disposal units in buildings.

Basic Design:

EADMINISTRATION

 

should be widest type possible. Space trees at least six feet
from fences or buildings to allow machines to get by and
keep width of walks six feet. Make sure deadend streets
have turning space and keep back-arounds to a minimum.
In feeding lawns use salt-spreader type equipment and make
feedholes for trees with air compressor.

Lawns—Use trees, small trees and large shrubs, acer gin-
nala, and cornus mas—mo small or medium shrubs. Elimi-
nate biennials, roses, iris, chrysanthemums, lilies, and so on.
If flowers are required, try narcissus, scilla, certain species
of tulips, crocus (spring and fall); avoid hyacinths. Use
only slow growing, hardy perennials, none which are ramp-
ant or must be divided often. Choose plant materials in ac-
cordance with function they must serve. Survey existing
plant materials and save only healthy specimens, protect dur-
ing construction period; keep new grades as close as feasible
to existing grades around trees to be saved.

In general, use slow growers near buildings and walks and
fast growers in lawn and mass plantings. Remove large
shrubs requiring annual pruning to keep shape. Use un-
clipped materials, only natural forms; no hedges, clipped
specimens, espaliers. Keep vines to a minimum, especially
on buildings. Remove low overhanging trees and shrubs
whenever possible; avoid competition between people and
plants on roads, walks and paths. Use groundcovers tolerant
of locations rather than lawns requiring high maintenance.
Use stonechips and terracing materials in locations under
trees instead of ground covers.

Plant for permanence; avoid filler plants. Locate trees
away from walks to prevent root heaving. Locate trees and
shrubs so as to prevent future conflicts. Locate plants away
from overhead utility lines, underground utility lines, wells,
septic tanks,_and drain fields. Avoid surface-feeding trees
(soft maples, elms, willows, poplars); these clog drains,
raise walks, rob lawns and beds of water and food.

Color accents—Use tubbed or large potted plants on terrace
and elsewhere rather than large amounts of annuals.

Bed levels—Keep same as lawn to eliminate shaping lawn
edge.

Bed treatment—To eliminate cultivation and constant weed-
ing use groundcovers such as evergreens, vinca, hedera,
pachysandra, pachystima, euonymus. taxus, and juniperns,
or ajuga, viola, hosta, and so on.

Bed edging—Use redwood strips on edge, steel lawn curbing
with adjoining paved or gravel areas.

Plant Materials—Utilize materials which maintain them-
selves; are free from insects and disease; are hardy without
protection or semi-hardy—requiring little protection. Use
plants which promise freedom from drought, freedom from
dieback (do not use wiegela, deutzia, philadelphus, budd-
lia), and freedom from pruning and suckering (plants with
own root rather than grafted where possible), and freedom
from cultivation (shrubs which are full to base). Plants
should be wind resistant and deep rooted, especially in mid-
dlc and old age; not brittle in ice storms; have good stem

472

and crotch structure; be vigorous and meet competition
well; have compatibility with new environment (exposure,
soil, drainage). Plant only at the correct horticultural sea-
son. Plant fresh nursery stock which has been root pruned
and from your own maintenance nursery if possible.

Planting Design:
Spacing—Use large groups requiring no soil cultivation
between large number of same species, large and small trees

rather than shrubs. Allow space for maximum growth; keep
plants away from walks and buildings.

Adjoining architecture—In special areas—under wide over-
hangs, balconies, and so on—use paving, stone chips, and
so on, rather than plantings; edge with redwood or like.
Plant outside drip line where natural moisture is available,
using spreaders or vines which will move into the dry zones.
Next to garden walls, sign posts, and so on, pave with brick,
concrete, or llagstone flush with turf for mowing rather than
hand clipping. Provide hard surfaces for areas likely to get
worn; use asphalt or stone and fences or walls in place of
hedges. Provide adequate rubbish or litter baskets and butt
jars in the right spots.

Planting Details:

Mulch—Use straw, rotted manure, leaf mold, or compost.
Antidesecant Sprays—Use wiltproof and plantcote sprays.
Staking—Do same time as planting of shade trees.
Guying—Do same time as planting; prepare deadmen. guys,
and so on in advance.

Pruning (a subject in itself)—llard rather than light de-
pending on specie; remove interior wood, etcetera, not

tcrniinals, to keep shape of specie.

Wrapping—Use kralt tree paper on everything except
shrubs, from ‘34” up.

Label—Permanent type should be attached at planting time
by foreman making final inspection.

Pruning—Use complete rejuvenation on older shrubs rather
than thinning by portable power saw or cutter bar.

Lawns—Feed with long-lasting fertilizer and test soil to
eliminate extra feedings. Use light foods by siphon method
and sprinkle system. Use slow-acting foods, otherwise extra
mowings in spring are necessary. No raking is necessary if
rotary cutters are used.

Leaf problem—Use mist sprayer to blow leaves into rows
or zones and pick up with vacuum raker; stockpile for leaf-
mold compost. There should be no hand raking, especially
of beds (leaves between shrubs turn to compost). Allow
cultivated circle around new plants for two years, afterwards
mow up to the plant.

Spraying—Use general all-purpose sprays, eliminate dor-
mant sprays where possible. Use dusts in early morning for
local control.

Chemical weed control—Follow extension suggestion in
each state.

Tree-feeding—Use air compressor during off months.

Winter protection—Use rabbit repellant spray. wilt-proof
spray for new evergreens; poison wheat in tubes for mouse
control; shade broadleaf evergreens. #

“What we need,” mused landscape architect William Rutherford, “is an island
right in the middle of that lake. Let’s build one.” Architect Rutherford was standing
in the midst of the 125 acres of wild woodland, lakes, and streams that make up
Sterling Forest Gardens near Tuxedo, New York. It was early this past summer,
shortly after the gardens had been officially opened to visitors for the first time. The
gardens are part of a corporate research “campus” (industrial park) in the foothills

of the Ramapo Mountains.
No one argued with the suggestion to “build” an island. Members of the Sterling

Forest operating staff had long since been imbued with the philosophy of “can-do.”
After all, the team had already transformed these many acres from the marshland and
peatbog into solid ground and a system of lakes that now served as the practical en-
vironment for literally millions of flowers of every description. After this gigantic
earth-moving and earth-shaping project, what was it to build a l’il ol’ island?

So they did. Not a big island, to be sure, and not an island from the ground up.
for this one floats on plastic logs and can even be moved out of the water, but an island
just the same. And it serves its purpose—not only as an accent of beauty but as a
sanctuary to which the ducks, swans, and flamingos that grace the lakes and shorelines

can retreat from man and smooth their ruffled feathers. #

The Junior Chamber of Commerce con-
tributed twenty-five hundred dollars
from its youth fund towards the con-
struction of play apparatus and mate-
rials. Artists of the area held an art
auction, individual artists contributing
one or more pieces of work. This raised
approximately fifteen hundred dollars
and was used for equipment. Private
individuals made contributions varying
from five to fifty dollars. In all, seventy-
five hundred dollars were collected for
development of the park.

Extensive research in public and pri-
vate libraries provided the basis for
Conejos’ pieces of sculpture, architec-
ture, relief work, pottery ornamenta-
tion, hieroglyphics, and symbolic de-
sign, as on the drinking fountain. An
enormous amount of research material
is studied and evaluated for utilization:

THE RA CE

fo r OPEN SPA CE

York City Metropolitan area (a region which em-

braces twenty-two counties in three states) must
spend $1,900,000,0-00 to acquire public recreation lands to
relieve the present “woeful deficiency” of such facilities.
According to The Race for Open Space,” final report of a
two-year study by the Park, Recreation, and Open Space
Project, the region’s 550 municipalities are so far short of
minimum recreation acreage standards that only four per-
cent of the area’s sixteen million residents can enjoy these
minimum facilities.

The study warns that both time and space are running
out. The situation grows more acute day by day since “be-
tween 1955 and 1985 the change predicted in the New York
region is as follows: population from 15,000,000 to 24,000,-
000; per capita real personal income from $2,470 to $4,350;
the work week from forty hours to thirty-two hours; and
passenger automobiles from 3,900,000 to 8,600,000. . . .
Every indicator of recreation demand . . . points to an in-
exorable rush to the outdoors.”

Three previous reports issued by the project include The
Law of Open Space by Shirley Adelson Siegel, The Dynam-
ics of Park Demand by Marion Clawson, and Nature in the
Metropolis by William A. Niering (see RECREATION, Octo-
ber 1960). All emphasize that the race for open space is
clearly one of the greatest and most urgent problems to face
the region in its long history.”

Among the proposals of the final report are recommenda-
tions to government agencies on various levels. The report
recommends to the federal government that:

“Federal policies and programs in fields which affect out-
door recreation should assist in the establishment of new
parks and should discourage encroachment on existing
parks. Particular agencies which need to stress the impor-
tance of parks and open space are the Bureau of Public
Roads, and the Housing and Home Finance Agency with its

constituent bodies, including the Federal Housing Admin-
istration and the Urban Renewal Administration. . . .

“The federal government should use its existing programs

to assist the states in acquiring park land accessible to
densely populated cities, just as it now assists the cities
themselves to establish parks in connection with urban re-
newal.

“Additional national parks should be located in closer
relation to urban population center. There are two great
opportunities to implement such a policy which would be of
great benefit to the people of the New York region, as well
as to the nation as a whole: the proposed Delaware Valley
Reservoir and Recreation Area and the proposed Cape Cod
National Seashore. Both areas are widely used by people
of the region.”

0 N THE state level the project study declares that, “Bold

leadership in the three states is essential if progress is
to be made in setting aside adequate open space for this
fast-growing region.

“New Jersey and Connecticut should follow New York’s
lead in permitting its municipalities to: (a) require dedica-
tions of land or payments in lieu of land from subdividers,
(b) allow clustering of buildings within existing zoning un-
der suitable conditions, (c) purchase less than a fee in land
in the form of development rights (conservation easements) .

“New Jersey’s provision for a longer maturity for park
acquisition bonds (forty years) should be adopted by the
other two states. All three states should consider better
means of assisting municipalities to soften the shock of a
suddcn loss of tax revenue which may occur when a county
or state park is established within their boundaries. This
might be done by payments in lieu of taxes which decline
to zero over a period of perhaps five years.

“Privately owned nonprofit open space which has con-
servation, educational, or csthetic value and whose perma-
nence is assured by deed restriction, or conservation ease-
ment to a government body, should be made tax-exempt in
New Jersey as it is now in New York and Connecticut.

“State highway programs should have parks prominently
in mind. They should consider helping to create new parks
and attractive rights-of-way by excess condcnmation and.
above all, they should avoid any encroachment on existing
parks?’

in recreation centers, clubs, and churches.

In a community center, interest must
be aroused and maintained in a hetero-
geneous group made up of teenagers,
young adults, adults, and older adults—
all having access to the facilities during
the limited number of hours allowed
for a women’s and girls’ program.
Since participation is voluntary and un-
controlled, the goals and objectives of
the program, although basically di-
rected towards physical fitness and
growth, must encompass needs that are
peculiar to a group-work agency, such
as adjustment to the group, recreation
outlets in a comfortable atmosphere.
social growth, and group acceptance.
In addition, there is the real problem of
developing and maintaining rapport
among a diversified, shifting, or apa-
thetic clientele.

Morning sessions tend to attract par-
ticipants of similar background—mar-

ried women whose children are at
school all day, married women without
children, and women whose economic
status permits domestic help. Within
this grouping, however, there may be
an age span of more than thirty years.
and classes and activities have to be
geared to stimulate enthusiasm, partici-
pation, and achievement for a wide
age range.

Evening sessions are attended pri-
marily by older career
women, and younger married women
whose husbands serve as babysitters
during their “night off.” There may
be a sprinkling of older women but,
by and large, the majority of older
women prefer morning sessions when

teenagers,

these are offered. However, in the
evening classes, too, problems are posed
by the age range. For the teenager a
few year‘s difference in age presents

177

a difficult hurdle, and, on the other
hand, the degree of tolerance and for-
bearance does not always directly in-
crease with increasing age.

For the purpose of providing the
most beneficial and enjoyable exercise
program, and one in which the great-
est number of participants can be in-
volved, many aspects of physical edu-
cation must be stressed—formal calis-
thenics, sports activities requiring a
minimum of initial skill and coordina-
tion, and activities for the highly
skilled, athletically inclined individual
—with no disproportionate emphasis
on any one of these areas. The ap-
proach to each should be carefully
thought through so that, where possible,
differences in age, inclination, aptitude,
and personality present no insuperable
obstacles. '

The term, “formal calisthenics” is
used here only in the sense of a regu-
larly scheduled program. In actuality,
informality in the center setting is the
keynote and the key to the success of
such a class. Warmth, concern, and
understanding must emanate from the
leader to the group—the ability to make
both obesity and fragility comfortable
under the same roof and the art of mak-
ing an individual ngre problem a
sympathetic group responsibility are
important tools in assuring regular at-
tendance. The common denominator of
physical well-being can make a co-
hesive, closely knit unit out of a nor-
mally highly dissimilar aggregation of
individuals.

IN DEVELOPING and promoting an on-
going ealisthenics class, too often
the primary emphasis has been, falla-
ciously, on “slenderizing.” In a frantic
attempt to compete with commercial
institutions and the high-powered ad-
vertising agencies, ealisthenics has be-
come synonymous with weight reduc-
tion in the material issuing from the
publicity departments of many group-
work and recreation centers. The un-
derweight or average-weight woman is
rarely considered or wooed in the litera-
ture prepared to highlight the pro-
gram—it having been decided by some
invisible authority that the appeal to
Vanity is far more effective than the
appeal to good sense—and a large ad-

age has no meaning in their concept of
eternal spring.

A more honest, albeit more dichult,
accent, which may not always obtain
immediate popular response but which
may have long range positive effects,
combines a major stress on the acqui-
sition or retention of suppleness, agility,
relaxation, coordination, with a minor-
key nod in the direction of weight re-
duction. A constant refrain on the
necessity for attaining and maintaining
physical thess in a motorized, labor-
saving-device civilization, although de-
void of glamor in its implication of a
narrow, rocky road to grace, is aimed
at a far wider audience than the merely
obcse. When the tired housewife, the
weary secretary, the stooping salesgirl
recovers from her initial shock at the
thought that all her expenditures of
energy and labor in her circumscribed
milieu must be supplemented regularly
by a supervised exercise routine in
order to sustain her physical and
mental well-being, and when she allows
herself to be drawn into the circle of
the initiate, she usually becomes an
enthusiastic advocate of the theory of
planned recreation in the community
center setting; for once committed a

convert rarely apostatizes.

Incorporating into the exercises
movements that have visual appeal, bor-
rowed perhaps from a ballet or modern
dance; developing a running verbal
commentary rather than the musical
accompaniment; iinaginatively entitling
each exercise (the “dip,” the “rock ’n
roll,” “the cakewalk,” the “chorus girl
routine”) ; interjecting health and diet
advice throughout the period are tech-
niques designed to retain the interest
of the participant. Daily exercise at
home, alone, may be a chore and a
bore, but in a group setting, under
supervision, a feeling of excitement and
shared fun can be successfully gen-
erated. The degree of intensity of this
feeling is directly related to the leader,
who must have a conviction of the
value of the program, coupled with
genuine enthusiasm and the ability to
infuse the group with a similar attitude.

In the flexible setting of the com-
munity center, morning participants
can be encouraged to bring their pre-
school children into the class. This has
been successfully implemented by hav-
ing a play area set aside in a corner of
the gymnasium for a small quiet-game
program for children during the class
period. Should the community center
have a nursery school program, a
natural mother-child coordinated pro-
gram can be developed. When parents
register their children for
school, their attention should also be
directed to the concomitant adult ac-
tivity. Conversely, mothers who com-
plain of being tied to the house by small
children when they are approached to
join the women’s exercise class can be
encouraged to enroll their children in
the nursery school.

In the area of specialized program
many ideas grow out of the basic need
to combine physical fitness values with
skill accomplishments, working with the
natural groupings that fall within the
center’s purview. A mother-child swim
instruction class can be developed, with
the primary emphasis on water-safety
rules to be absorbed and followed by
parents; the secondary purpose being
the acquisition of techniques for help-

A morning exercise-badminton group
can hold its summer sessions at least
once a month at one of the city parks
or at the home of a member. A golf
instruction group can be formed into
a once-a-month (or often)
tournament, leasing a park or club set-
ting, and planning an entire day’s pro-
gram based on this activity, to include
a picnic lunch, prizes, or trophies, and
the provision of additional instruction,
if desired, by staff in a completely in-
formal atmosphere. Similarly, a youth
tennis-instruction group can be con-
tinued on a coed basis by providing a
social dance hour following the formal

Memphis merchants.

Bright Ideas

 Spray small trees, branches, and
ornaments with aerosol-type paint
spray bombs. Small objects can be
hung up with string and sprayed while
slowly spinning. Use the new fiorescent
spray paints or spray on a solid base
coat and then mist in contrasting spat-
ters.

 Shatterproof fragile glass orna-
ments with clear shellac by pouring a
small amount of shellac inside each and
swirling until inside is coated. Replace
metal hangers. Shellac will keep orna-
ments from shattering if dropped and
hold them together if cracked.

various modifications to fit into the
physical facilities available—swimming
pool, massage-steam rooms, double
gymnasium, bowling alleys, etcetera,
but the important point to keep in mind
is that competition with school cur-
ricula or private health clubs is self-
defeating and stultifying. A leader’s
rigidity in the translation of profes-
sional training into practice can but
lead into the deadend of decreasing
membership and participation—in an
era when more than ever the crying
need is for more imaginative and more
inclusive concern with the development
of a dynamic program for the physical
wellbeing of the largest

ABOUT TWICE A

year almost
every recreation
director feels the
need for inaugu-
rating some new or
different recrea-
tion program for
his community. The Moline, Illinois,
Recreation Department, serving a pop-
ulation of about forty-three thousand,
felt just such a need last October.

After a discussion with local sport-
ing goods dealers about the tremendous
increase and interest in camping, this
department decided to learn exactly the
extent of this interest in the town. Thc
local paper agreed to carry an editorial
about the increase in camping, its re-
lated fields, and its many advantages,
as Well as an “intercst” ballot form, to
be fillcd out and returned to the rec-
reation oflice.

Eight families replied, indicating in-
terest in becoming members of a camp-
ing club. The recreation department
wrote these families, set up a first meet-
ing of what was to become the family
camping club, and provided enough
program materials and refreshments
for about fifteen or twenty people. The
local library supplied camping films
and local sporting goods stores supplied
additional information and pamphlets.

Thirty-five attended that first meet-
ing. They discussed the feasibility of a
camping club program and decided to
hold a monthly meeting, and to make
up and conduct the entire program
themselves. During the first eight

months the number of families in-
creased from the original eight to 141,
representing some 560 individuals.

The recreation department has de-
vised registration forms which require
the family’s name and address, phone
number, type of camping, number of
years at it, as well as each child’s name
and age. The form also contains Space
for a suggested list of other possible
club members. Because of the ever-in-
creasing large mcmbership, a rotating
refreshment committce of club wives
takes earc of buying and serving.
Money is collected at each meeting and
put into a kitty for thc next timc.

Members keep up to date, between
meetings, via a campers’ newsletter con-
taining information from thc campers,
details on weekend campsites around
the Moline area, equipment informa-
tion and prices, campsite regulations, a
classified listing of items wanted and
for sale, listing of books on camping,
litcraturc sources, camping recipes and
games, and so forth. This is passed out
free to all members attending elul)
meetings.

One of the club’s first actions was
electing a board of directors to plan
futurc mcetings and programs. These
people meet between the club’s regular
monthly meetings and plan such activi-
ties as panel discussions, slide presenta-
tions, movies, open discussions, gadget
shows, equipment displays, spceches,
and so on. Club meetings last two hours
and the recrcation department supplies
a game room, games, and equipment,
and a supervisor for the children, to
make it a true family activity.

Bccause of the club’s continuing
growth, a contest was hcld to detcrmine

 

the design and club colors for a club
patch. The patches are now on view,
across the nation’s campgrounds, on
numerous pieces of equipmcnt and
wearing apparel. Auto stickers are next.

Two major activities climaxed the
winter program: an outdoor display of
camping equipment supplied by local
dealcrs and distributors and a weekend
club camping trip to a state park one
hundred miles away. The outdoor show,
held on a Sunday afternoon in one of
Moline’s parks, attracted between 750
and 1,000 people.

Before the weekend camping trip to
Lake Ceode in Iowa, several volunteer
advance partics went to the campsite to
take pictures and draw area maps. Let-
ters were also sent to the park ranger to
make oflicial arrangements. At the last
few meetings before the trip nincty-
three families signed up for the trip.
Unfortunately, the weather was bad and
only forty-four families actually went.
Those attending, howcver, participated
in nature hikes, fishing, sightseeing,
and so on. Campers built a council fire
on Saturday night, roasted marshmal-
lows, sang songs, told storics, and in-
dulged in other typical eampfirc activi-
ties.

The camping club has been cxtreme-
ly succcssful and continues to expand.
It already nceds largcr quartcrs. Thc
recrcation department receives weekly
requests about 111cmbership in the new
club. Thc local sporting goods dealers
are also enthusiastic, as witness their
offers to club 111cmbcrs of special week-
end sales and discounts. The club mem-
bers and the recreation dcpartment are
looking forward to a vcry successful

Reviving an Old Musical Art

lengthen, small groups scattered

all over the country gather with
friendly neighbors and play a most
unusual holiday serenade. Solemnly
garbed, each of the “musicians” carries
a small bell in each hand, and some-
times an extra one in a pocket. Soon
the air, crisp with the breath of Christ-
mas, is filled with the tinkle of carols
and folk tunes produced by the little
choir of melodious chimes.

This scene takes place in about a
hundred towns or villages, most of them
in New England where the custom in
America originated. Rung by devoted
fans, hand bells stimulate the Yuletide
spirit among friends, cheer shut-ins and

dren’s party in Brookline, a Boston sub-
urb, twenty years ago. He ordered a set,
got his family to practice, and has stim-
ulated the formation of at least ten new
groups.

One of his fellow ringers has intro-

duced hand bells at the Brearley School
in New York City. There are groups at

 

Bennington College in Vermont; in
Pittsfield, Massachusetts; at Prince-
ton and Michigan State Universities; in
churches in large cities on both sea-
boards. In addition to the New Eng-
land Guild of Handbell Ringers, there
is also a national guild. Together, they
are expanding a centuries-old English
tradition. Actually, however, bell ring-
ing on various forms is one of the oldest

musical arts, recorded in the pagan rit-
ual of ancient Egypt.

Beautiful as it may sound to the ear,
most ringing we hear from tower bells
is but a glorified sound effect, which
consists of endless permutations (called
“changes”) of the notes of the scale,
scientifically organized into definite
patterns.

A “peal” of over five thousand
changes is possible on a set of only
seven bells, requiring three hours of
steady ringing by a paragon of strength,
coordination and memory.

Originally, hand bells were used
merely to practice change ringing with-
out disturbing people living near the
belfries. Their musical potentialities
were discovered only a hundred years
ago. It developed that the small treble
bells can produce trills; that the large
tenor bell, when swung, sounds like a
church bell; that, by varying the force
of striking, eXpression and dynamic ef-
fects not usually identified with bell

ringing can be obtained.

 

Since 1945 bell ringers have been
Hooded with inquiries by people who
want to take up this new group activity.
For, in addition to being a unique form
of music-making—in an age when re-
corded music is ever-present—bell ring-
ing leads to a wider appreciation of

music itself. The hand bell offers al-
most limitless opportunities for eXperi-
menting with variations of musical
themes, and it has become a popular in-
strument on the “concert stages” of
smaller communities. Repertories are
no longer confined to carols and folk
songs, but include many airs from con-
cert classics. Activities are no longer
confined to Christmas Eve.

And yet, Christmas Eve is the bell

ringers’ big night. For inevitably the
sound of bells evokes visions of wintry
landscapes and crackling fireplaces, of
the smell of pine and the hope of peace,
which make up the magic of Christ-

mas. #

Social Recreation

and the Church

Harold Harton

aovmmc THE PLACE and the lead-
P ership for wholesome play or
suitable social recreation for a
church group has many possibilities.
The program can be chosen or adjusted
to match the social codes and the facili-
ties of any denomination or church. lf
dancing _is forbidden, “moving in time
to music” may not be. If musical in-
struments or records are inappropriate,
we can sing or clap our way to a happy
frame of mind. If there is not enough
Space for active games, we can use some
that are especially planned for small
places. We can be creative in music,
drama and crafts.

But what about the leadership? In
most churches it is notably difficult to
enlist enough Sunday-school teachers,
choir members and executive personnel
for all the organizations. Those who vol-
unteer their services are usually kcpt
very busy. Few of them will have had
any leadership eXperience in social rec-
reation.

One answer may be to bring in help
from outside. But for the activity to
be really meaningful, the leadership
should come from within. Furthermore,
it is also difficult to find enough leaders
in the community outside the church.
Many churches are faced with the prob-
lem of training their own lcaders in
suitable rccreation program mcthods
and techniques. What do tlicy do about
it?

If several congregations are able to

482

get together, a course in such training
may be arranged. It could be planned
on the basis of suitable activities, how
they may be adaptcd to the various or-
ganizations within the churches, and
why they should be encouraged. ft is
of the utmost importance that the in-
structors in such a course be an enlight-
ened and understanding person, as well
as a skillcd lcader. Above all, he should
radiate enthusiasm and the philosophy
that “people are more important than
” Unless this is so, the ca-
reers of potential leaders may be alarm-

ingl y short.

activilies.

OW WHAT are the problems of a

social recreation leader in the
church? Our answer may be gleaned
from the numerous requcsts for help
one hears from church organizations.
Can you suggest a program for our
couples, club? How can we eXpand the
activitics of our teen-age club? Have
you any suggestions for our Sunday-
school picnic program? What can we
do to make our auxiliary meetings more
interesting?

Are thcre not common denominators
for all the leadcrs of these different
groups? Certainly their desire to hpr
pe0ple cnjoy themselvcs. and to assist
the church in its endeavours. is uni-
form.

To the inexperienced leader of an
adult group it may seem that little help
is to be gaincd from attending a coursc

in teen-age recreation. If we could just
overcome this unfortunate misconcep-
tion, many organizations would benefit.
For some reason or other, the idea is
prevalent that recreation leaders should
have “prescriptions” for programing.
They look for agencies that will provide
prearranged programs. the games, so-
cializers and dances all carefully ex-
plained. The fact is that very few for-
mula programs are available. On the
other hand there is almost unlimited
sUpply of resource material available in
books and magazines, on records, and
through the various idea services.

We are led to the conclusion that the
greatest need is for leadership tech-
niques and rcsourccfulness in program-
ing. A versatile lcadcr can instill a
grcat deal of enthusiasm into any group
by making onc program fit the pe0ple—
and not fitting the people to a packaged
program.

Ideas do not grow on trees or come
in neat little packages. They grow 'in
the minds of resourceful pe0ple. Every
church group has people who need only
a training ground for developing their
ideas lo the place where they become
a tangiblc cxprcssion in the life of the

church. #

synchronized swimmers performed to
“Around the World”; the weather re-
port was “Stormy Weather,” with dry
ice in the pool making the clouds; and
the editorial page was done to “The

boats, boating, fishing, golf, horseback
riding, archery, family camping, and
pony rides were open at half price. In
beautiful autumn weather, charter boat
trips, food drawings, drawings for boat
rental and permits; golf passes for the

Accountability for Tools and Equipment
WE ALL FACE the problem of careless handling of tools

resulting in loss, theft, and breakage. The dollar

value of losses in equipment and tools through loss.
theft, or breakage is less important than the attitudes of
carelessness developed in the worker which affect his pro-
duction output and the pride he feels in doing his job. A
system for the control of damage and loss of tools will also
encourage proper attitudes and principles involved in the
careful and correct handling of tools by the employee. The
values encouraged by a system of control include: fixing
of responsibility, conservation of property, appreciation of
property value, and more efficient work accomplishment.
Steps necessary in setting up a system of control include:

Methods of Control

MARKING SYSTEMS

1. Schotchlite decals—various sizes and designs.

2. Branding iron for burning initials or designs into wood
parts.

3. Penctrating die for marking metal parts.

4. Electric pencil for inscribing metal parts.

5. Vibrating hammer for marking metal parts.

6. Metal stanIps.

7. Metal tags—to be attached with adhesive backing or
with drive screws.

8. Colored paints. Use conspicuous colors for rapid iden-
tification and a color code to identify assignment of tool to
individual parks in a park system.

9. Embossed equipment (done by the manufacturer when
items are purchased in quantity).

10. ludelible pencil for marking porous equipment.

LOCATION OF MARKINCS

1. Should be placed in prominent place where they may
easily be seen.

2. Should be placed where it will not be erased by natural
wear inflicted by daily use.

3. Should be placed in a consistent place to facilitate rapid
identification.

MR. TODD is assistant executive director of the National.
Recreation Association.

STORAGE FACILITIES

1. One man should be responsible for signing tools in and
out. This should not be his sole responsibility but merely
part of his job.

2. Tool boxes containing tools for particular jobs. Applies
to a system where specific tools are assigned to individuals
for long periods of time.

3. Individual lockers. Also applies to systems _where tools
are assigned to individuals f0r long periods of time.

4. Wall storage. Paint outline of tool on wall where it
hangs.

5. Mobile tool storage: (a) mobile repair units, (b) tools
assigned to particular vehicles.

CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT SYSTEMS

1. Written receipt required for tools assigned.

2. Tag system—identifies employee. Tag is hung in the
place occupied by the tool.

3. Blackboard system. Name of the employee and tools
assigned written on large board.

FIXING RESPONSIBILITY
1. Tools may be assigned daily or for a period of time.

Signature form should be used which identifies tools as-
signed and fixes responsibility in the employee using the
tool. '
2. The foreman or crib man who signs for special tools
(electric drills, sanders, etcetera) should be held respon-

sible.

DISCIPLINE

1. Loss of time—layoff.

2. Cost reimbursement.

3. Reflection on service rating (merit system).

4. There is need for careful study of legal aSpects and re-
sponsibilities involved with such things as civil service and
union implications. Policy for disciplinary actions should
be set by policy-making authorities.

INVENTORY

1. Scheduled physical checks should be made by admin-
istrative personnel.

3. Spotchecks or unscheduled physical checks should be
made by supervisors or administrative personnel.

Conclusion

The most important aspect of accountability for public
tools and equipment rests in the attitudes developed in the
employee as a result of the methods of control exercised.
There is no one best system or method of control in this
process of accountability. The suggestions brought out here
should therefore be applied by each individual department
in accordance with its particular organization, size, and

needs. if:

cities are littered with ugliness and choked with automobiles. Our parks, schools,
museums, municipal buildings, and transportation systems are unattractive and poorly

maintained. Our urban areas sprawl, constantly swallowing up agricultural land and

ignoring the need to preserve the countryside.

If the good life of the futUre is not to degenerate into a vast trafiic jam and a
strangled complex of cities, there is urgent need for immediate urban, regional, state-

wide, and nationwide master planning [see also Page 476]. Such planning . . .

must

preserve and reestablish recreational areas and landscape. It must reorganize urban
areas into compact pedestrian islands, surrounded by open space, within which public
and private transportation can speedily move—VICTOR GRUEN, architect and city

planner.

Ten Challenges
Continued from Page 468

 

to be emerging. Technical and scientific values, rather than
humanitarian values are emphasized. Agencies have been
concerned with methods rather than with social goals and
social values.” Ohio summed it up: “We may build the
deadliest missile, or send man farther into space than any
other nation, or even conquer disease, but unless we help
our children and youth to understand and follow the basic

values of life, we shall have failed in our greatest and most
sacred obligation.”

Challenge X then, is our greatest challenge— the Chal-
lenge of Lasting Values. Virtue, morality, ethics, courage,
courtesy, citizenship are old-fashioned words. Our children
and youth are surrounded by cheap cynicism that tends to
negate the good and the beautiful. They see a daily flouting
of law; they see the wicked flourishing, bribery and corrup-
tion in high places; they find immorality accepted in the
books they read, the movies and television they see. They

see crime pay off and honesty laughed at.

Behind the skills we can teach, beyond the programs we
can provide, must come a deliberate, strong emphasis on the
basic values of life. Let no one say that this is not the
business of recreation or that it should not be its major
objective. If we place more emphasis on strength, fleetness
of foot, quickness of eye and of wit than we place ou respect
for human dignity, appreciation of goodness and beauty,
and responsibility for the rights and privileges of all, then
we are slated for oblivion, and we do not deserve the title
of youth-serving or character-building agency.

Since we started out with a quotation from Socrates, it is
fitting to close it with a quotation from a poem by Eugene
Fuller called “Athenian Youth Speak of Socrates”:

Many before him had no doubt been wise,
And many brave, and many loved truth;
But he, we think, deserves the earliest prize
For making all these beautiful to youth.

I pray that every child and youth in America can say the
same for each of us. #

 

Race for Open Space
Continued from Page 476

 

THE REPORT calls on the counties to establish park sys-
tems to encompass a wide range of needs: recreation,
water supply, flood control, storm water drainage, and na—
tural area and wildlife preservation. The study states:
“The establishment in the past of three great county park
systems in Essex and Union Counties in New Jersey and
Westchester County in New York give inspiration for meet-
ing the greatly expanded role which county parks will be
called upon to assume in the years ahead. Advancing from
the present 28,000 acres to 263,000 acres in county parks
will require acts of great leadership by county government.
Two counties have already begun to meet the challenge.
Morris and Somerset Counties in New Jersey have new park
agencies; they have county park plans which meet the stand-
ards set forth by this project; and they have acquisition and
deve10pment programs underway. More limited progress
is being made in Bergen, Westchester, and Suffolk Counties.

“In the absence of county government in Connecticut, the
role of providing close-in, all-day recreation areas for Fair-
field County will have to be undertaken in part by the cities
and towns and in part by the state. A means of integrating
efforts to provide all-day recreation facilities might be
through intermunicipal regional planning agencies which
are already being organized in the state.

ON THE municipal level, the report asks the region’s 550

municipalities to “acquire adequate park acreage, to
practice conservation, to permit flexibility of design in resi-
dential areas in order to achieve better open space in the
form of residential commons, to protect the parks they al-
ready have, to concentrate on park acquisition while there
is still time and lcave park develOpmcat for later. to control
water pollution and beach erosion. to plant new trees and
preserve existing trces.”

The report also covers the region, site by site, making
specific recommendations. These include ten new regional
parks, five in New Jersey (Delaware Valley, Island Beach
State Park, Lake \Vawayanda, Round Valley and Spruce
Run, and Sandy Hook), four in New York (Fire Island,
Lloyd Neck, Moriches Inlet to Montauk. and Shawangunk
Mountains) and a tri—state park in Connecticut. Vew York,
and Massachusetts. #

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

+ The program planning committee
for the 42nd National Recreation Con-
gress tried something new this year. It
scheduled meetings of general interest,
such as “Understanding the Needs of
Older People,” “Workshop on Prob-
lems of Supervisors,” “Recreation Re-
search—The What, Why and How,”
etcetera, on Monday and Thursday.
Tuesday and Wednesday were used for
special meetings so that those people
working with the ill and handicapped
could meet together. We are interested
in knowing how you liked this plan and
would appreciate hearing from you.

‘i‘ The Hospital Section of the New
York State Recreation Society is in the
process of amassing statistical data and
graphic materials for a large-scale ex-
hibition on recreation services for the
ill and handicapped in New York State.
This exhibit will be shown at the soci-
ety’s annual conference in Syracuse in
April 1961 and will be available for
other showings in the state thereafter.
It is hoped that such materials will be of
use in recruitment and career confer-
ences. Here is something that other
state societies miglit plan to do!

+ Dr. Morton Thompson, director of
the Consulting Service’s homebound
project, reports that it is now working
with thirty-four patients. In this initial
stage of the project we are delighted
that twenty homebound persons are
now leaving their homes with the assist-
ance of volunteers and five of them are
now attending regular programs at a
community center.

tion Association Consulting Service on

'i‘ Among those present at the recent
National Rehabilitation Conference in
Oklahoma City, October 10-12, was
Doris Berryman, who attended on be-
half of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation Consulting Service on Recrea-
tion for the III and Handicapped. She
reports that in the session on “The Re-
lation of Age to Rehabilitation Serv-
ices,” two of the speakers discussed the
importance of recreation in total re-
habilitation. We are pleased that this
group is beginning to take an active in-
terest in the vital role that recreation

plays.

 

'i‘ For those working with the mentally
retarded, the National Association for
Retarded Children has announced the
inauguration of a series of chain dis-
cussion letters on activity-center pro-
grams for teenage and young adult re-
tardates. The Consulting Service have
been asked to contribute to these letters.
If you have some successful program
ideas which you want to share with
others, we would appreciate receiving

them so they may be included. (See
also Page 470.)

‘i‘ The Connecticut State Department
of Health has added a consultant in
recreation to its staff, effective as of
January 1. This consultant will be re-
sponsible for chronic-disease hospitals,
nursing homes, homes for the aged, and
other such institutions. The State of
Pennsylvania also created a similar
position in its Department of \Velfare
last spring. Here we see the beginning
of a trend which will create many new
positions in the next few years.

EVALUATING A RECRUITMENT FILM

Recreation leaders have for years felt
the need for a dynamic presentation of
the career opportunities in recreation.
In 1958 the Athletic Institute attempted
to fulfill that need when it produced a
twenty-seven minute color film, Careers
in Recreation. Although the film was
highly endorsed by recreation profes-
sional workers, the reactions of stu-
dents, for whom the film was intended,
were not known. In a recent study for
his master's thesis, Watson B. Hovis of
the University of Illinois has attempted
to discover the effects of the film on stu-
dents and relate these findings to future
recruitment.

Limited experimental and survey
methods were employed. Eight hundred
and sixty-six students from four Illinois
high schools were selected. An experi-
mental situation was devised in which
one group, the “variables,” viewed the
film, while the other, the “controls,”
continued classes as usual. Question-
naires were answered before and after
the film showing. The information was
then tabulated, with differences and
variations noted. Comparisons of dif-
ferent groups of students were made in
order to determine any relationships
that might exist, followed by conclu-
sions and generalizations based on the
findings. Among them were:

° Nearly all of the students (97%) in
the experiment received a better under-
standing of the field of recreation from
the film.

° Very few students had ever been con-
taeted—eithcr personally or in a group
—conccrning the choice of a career in
recreation.

' Students having relatives or close
personal friends in recreation work
were significantly more inclined to con-
sider such a career.

° Rural students were significantly
more interested in a career in recrea-
tion, both before and after seeing the
film, than were the city students.
° Students presumed to be leaders
were significantly less interested in a
career in recreation after seeing the film
than were the nonleader students.
° Prior to the film showing, male stu-
dents were more interested in a career
in recreation than were the female stu-
dents. Following thc film the trend was
reversed.
° Students from cities which do not
have city-sponsored recreation were
more interested in a recreation career
than those students from cities in which
recreation is city sponsored.
' Students who were planning to go to
college were generally less interested in
a career in recreation than were the
students not planning to go to college.
° An overall favorable reaction to the
film was most evident.
' Very few students had difficulty un-
derstanding the film.
' Although most of the students be-
lieved the film accomplished its mis-
sion of interesting students in a career
in recreation, these findings were not
born out in practice, as, in almost all
cases, the number of students who
would consider a career in recreation
decreased or stayed about the same af-
tor the film showing.
' Many of the students lack a knowl-
edge of the scope, nature, and signifi-
cance of rccrealion.
' Recreation recruitment contacts in
the schools are totally inadequate.
Among the observations and conclu-
sions based on the study are:
' The fact that before we can cchct
a film to interest more students in a
recreation career, the profession will

Recnemos

have to educate students and the public
in general to the scope, nature, and sig-
nificance of recreation.

' Careers in Recreation cannot do this
job of education by itself. The film is
but one tool among many and should
not be relied upon to carry the whole
load.

' The film apparently does not interest
a suflicient number of the type of per-
son recreation needs—the leader and
the college-preparatory student.

' The present quality and extent of rec-
reation recruitment is entirely inade-

quate. #

0 A heavy-duty, self-propelled four-and-one-half-horse-
power rotary snow thrower, with 54”-by-17” capacity, can
get to the bottom of some of your winter maintenance prob-
lems. The Sno-Thro clears a two-foot-wide path, 65 to 125
feet long, in one minute. This is equivalent to hand shov-
eling three hundred average-size, snow-heaped shovelsful—
approximately fifteen hundred pounds of snow. The slow-
turning, self-cleaning blades uniformly feed the Sno-Thro.
High-speed blades then throw the snow up to twenty-five feet
away in any direction. The 180-degree, swiveling direc-
tional discharge is controlled by a hand crank within easy
reach of the operator. The heavy-duty, recoil-starting Lau-
son engine is winterized, has two forward speeds and re-
verse, dependable belt, gear, and chain drive—-—all fully
guarded—and pneumatic tires selected for the most positive
traction under all types of snow-removal conditions. Circle

o A new fiberglass basketball backboard has the strength
and resilience of metal boards, with the added benefits of
being lightweight and weather resistant; it will not rust or
corrode, is almost indestructible. Special reinforcement
ribs on the reverse side give extreme strength and rigidity.
It can be easily installed outdoors or indoors. Circle #102.

0 A new plastic one-coat protective finish may be used for
either outdoor or indoor maintenance of park, playgrounds,
sports, and outdoor equipment. The coating comes in eight
colors or clear and gives a smooth, tile-like finish with a
brilliant gloss. It can be applied like ordinary paint with a
roller, brush, or spray, and one coat will normally cover
any previously painted surface that has been properly pre-
pared. The substance will not harden in the can after it
has been opened and it is virtually marproof, will not chip
or peel, is not brittle or absorbent, and resists weather, ag-
ing, wear, fading, abrasion, moisture, and grease. It is
washable and impervious to most acids and chemicals.
Recommended for metal, masonry, concrete, wood, glass,
and plastic surfaces, it is excellent for use on corridors,
locker rooms, toilets, equipment, and machinery. Circle

##103.

0 A new “Roving Rostrum” public address system has
many recreation uses—for leaders of sports and camp pro-
grams, as well as dance, drama, and discussion grmlps, and
for all manner of public meetings. It is completely self-
contained, and portable unit, includes a lectern, is fully

490

  

  

transistorized and battery-operated. Enclosed in a modern.
lightweight, luggage-type carrying case, the system includes
a microphone with gooseneck stand, ten-watt amplifier, ten-
inch heavy-duty speaker, output for external speaker (when
addressing crowds of over six hundred), output for tape
recorder, and phone-microphone inputs. It runs on two

lantern batteries which have an average life of three months,
and the unit is 16"-by-18"-by-813". Circle #104.

T. o A new plastic pool en-
closure, wider than us-
ual, is called the “46” for
it 46-foot width. It comes
- r in standard length of 80
feet, but can be ordered

A in any size desired. Alu-

1ninum ribs form a rigid arch over the pool, supporting the
plastic-film cover. The enclosure stands firmly without in-
terior columns or braces, is strong enough to resist winds
up to eighty miles per hour and heavy loads of snow. It lets
in sunshine, keeps wind out, extending the season for out-
door pools. \Vilh lights and heat added, it makes swimming
pleasant any time of the day or year. In summer, plastic
screens can be substituted at the sides and ends, providing
breezeways while keeping out airborne litter. Plastic film

on top forms an umbrella against summer rains. The en-

closure is easily disassembled and stored. For more infor-
mation circle #105.

0 Recent storms and hurricanes did endless damage to
lighting poles throughout the country, most of which were
erected before locking-type receptacles were developed.
With a new bracket, any photoelectric lighting control can
be used on any existing pole. Made of cast aluminum, it is
weather resistant and virtually indestructible. It measures
two and a quarter inches in diameter to provide precision
fit with controls having NEMA standard-base dimensions.
The one-piece seamless casting embodies a half-inch pipe
thread stem, for simple installation on the conduit or relay
boxes normally used on existing poles and crossarms. For
more information, circle #106.

0 Refuse burner with prefabricated construction, triple
draft, disposes of many types of waste material. Optional
extras include alnminized steel coating, inner lining of 2-1-
gaugc corrugated steel. Maximum fire safety is prime de-
sign consideration. For folder with specifications and pho-
tographs, circle #107.

0 Fabrique, a nonwovcn vinyl-impregnated fabric wall cov-
ering, created by Birge, is not only attractive, but durable
and easy to maintain, making it ideal for recreation build-
ings, classrooms, or wherever young people congregate.
The material has been found to be virtually stainproof: lip-
stick, crayon, ink, grease all wipe off without a trace with a
little soap and water. It is elastic, permits contraction and
expansion of building walls, eliminating the necessity for
precise laying of concrete blocks. Thus, both labor and
maintenance costs are substantially reduced. Circle #108.

Provides Albuquerque swim patrons
with finest checking facilities...

When Albuquerque built its new Los Altos Park
pool, the City Commission and Recreation Board
were determined it would not be obsoleted in a
few years by new materials and methods. Among
progressive ideas incorporated in the facility
were Sentinel self-serve checking lockers instead
of old-fashioned basket checking.

Robert L. Burgan, Director of the city’s Parks
and Recreation Department, in making a direct
comparison with their other swimming pool
operations, points out these Sentinel advantages;
faster flow through bathhouse because patrons
do their own checking, no custody liability, no
special checking of valuables, no checkroom pay-
roll costs, less space required, and very important

The Mason Protected Fund Raising Plat

You and your organization can raise

PROFIT WITHOUT

RISK 0R INVESTMENT
THE

Mason, the greatest name in candies, makers of Mason Mints, Dots,

Black Crows, Peaks, etc. has designed this Protected, No-Investment,
No Risk Plan for easiest, most eflicient fund-raising ever!
Here is how it works. We ship you candy on consignment,

freight prepaid, and give you fifteen days in which to sell it
(additional days may be granted upon application) — at less

    than the Regular Retail Price — (you pay nothing until after you

have sold the candy) and you make a net profit of 66%% on cost.
Even more important, you may return any unsold candy and pay only
for that which you have sold, provided you pay the return

shipping charges on the unsold candy and first contact our local
representative (or our Home Office) for return routing instructions.

Specifically. There are 30 packages in a carton. (See illustration.)
Each package sells for $1.00. (This is less than the regular
retail price.) You pay us $18.00 for each carton after you have

)8  err collected your own money. Your profit is 1912.00 per carton. Minimum

order is 15 cartons and we pay the shipping charges on all orders.

Note: Order a conservative but adequate amount, since you must allow
a minimum of four months before you can receive another shipment.
A good yardstick as to quantity you should order is our

experience that the average active volunteer can sell
END Investment one carton of 30 packages .

 

Variety—Your Choice. Three different kinds of candy are
available: For Fall, Winter and Spring, these wonderful Mason items: '5

Mason Mints — Magnifiquel
Smoothest, creamiest mint covered with rich, dark chocolate.

Mason. Almond Cocoamtt — Magnifique! (for Summer also)
NO  A taste-treat beyond compare with cocoanut and crunchy almonds.

Mason Assorted Jellies — Magnifiquel ( for Summer also)
The most delicate of Jellies — Fruity, luscious and soft.

Completely Protected Terms. As you see from the above, the

terms are so designed to make fund-raising completely Protected for you.

The Protected plan, with \Iason’s Personalized Package Look at the consignment agreement on the order blank. This is your

your group’s name, picture and/ or insignia printed on guarantee that (a) you need not give us any money until after you

each package free. See illustrations of packages and have sold the candy, and (b) you may return any unsold candy and pay
sample personalizations. only for that which you have sold. You may, of course, elect to

keep the unsold candy, in which case you will pay for the whole

shipment. This “No Risk” Option eliminates loss and actually

guarantees a profit for your organization. Why not let Mason solve

your fund-raising problems the Protected way? To call for your local

be thoroughly prepared for function-
ing beyond the narrow limits of institu-
tional living. Therefore, it is extremely
important to plan comprehensive recre-
ation programs for retardates which
establish and maintain a balance with
the realistic rehabilitation aims for that

particular person.

The field of recreation can be opened
to every retarded child and adult. The
retardate’s need for enjoying leisurc
hours is just as strong as it is for any
of us. Although we cannot expect the
retarded to develop high degrees of so-
cial-recreation skill, the other benefits
recreation can ofier are perhaps more
important to them than to others.

The retarded child’s capacity for self-
expression through recreation activity
—-—whether in an institutional setting or
in the community—is limited. With the
added limitation imposed by the shel-
tered environment of the institution, the
recreation leader has to use ingenuity
and careful planning to defeat the dc-
energizing influence and inertia fos-
tered by this sheltered environment.
Without such ingenuity and planninrr,
the retarded child in a residential facil-
ity has small chance of having the rec-
reation activities and leisure-time ex-
pcriences necessary for a person to
become accomplished in the “art of

” This is true not only for the

child, but
equally so for the retarded child at

living.
institutionalized retarded
home. He, too, needs special learning
experiences in the art of living. Hence,
emphasis is now being placed on such
learning, not only for the school-age
retarded child, but in preschool pro-
grams and facilities.

A quote from Virginia Musselman’s
paper at the 1957 New Jersey \Velfare
Conference might well serve as our
credo as we approach the problem of
serving the retarded. “Above all, we
need to have more confidence in each
other, to learn more about each others
work, and to work out ways of sharing
our knowledge and experience, our re-
sources and our leadership. Let’s think
more about the child as a person, and
less about him as a problem or a
case.”

Sanford White Day was celebrated
in Sylacauga, Alabama this summer.
honoring Sanford White, the seventy-
two-year-old engineer of Noble Park's
Jollie Trollie. Mr. \Vhite retired from
Avondale Mills in 1953 after thirty
years of service and has been at the
J ollie Trollie helm sincc 1957, thus ful-
filling a lifelong ambition to run a train
—even a miniature one. Beloved by the
Sylacauga youngsters, modest and un-
assuming, Mr. White was abashed by
this honor. His first rcaction was. “Aw,
shucks, I don’t deserve it.”

Paving the Way
Continued from Page 465

 

sion can be severe and rapid. Maintenance and resurfacing
must be done regularly, and curbing should be provided on
all edges of the material to prevent deterioration. The ori-
ginal material and installation costs are comparable to those
of concrete.

T anbark—Fine for play equipment areas. It is extremely
resilient, easy to maintain, and resistant to deterioration
from the elements. Water dissipates through it rapidly; if
provision is made for this water to pass through the con-
taining curbing, no sogginess will occur. The material will
smoulder, but will not ignite. It must be turned over occa-
sionally with a spading fork to prevent excessive compac-
tion, and is soon displaced under swings or at other points
of concentrated traffic. After a number of years, tanbark
pulverizes and must be replaced, but it does not splinter or
stick to clothing and is not easily thrown about by children.
No safer, more satisfactory surfacing is available for use
under play equipment. It is attractive and cost of the mate-
rial is justified, since use of this protective surfacing has
drastically reduced the number of severe accidents in
heavily used facilities.

Sand—For limited use on play equipment areas. It is par-
ticularly good for preschool-children’s areas since it encour-
ages the necessary and much neglected creative play func-
tion of a recreation area. However, its disadvantages are
numerous. Children throw it around causing physical haz-
ards and maintenance problems, and it can severely abrade
surrounding hard surface paving. Sanitary treatment is
necessary because of the intimate nature of play with this
material, and, since concussions from a fall are more severe
than in tanbark areas, the height of equipment placed in it
should be limited.

Brick, Flagstone and Granite Block Paving—Best for special
areas, such as tree pits, entrance courts, or sitting areas,

Our conception of space for recreation—both the
large natural areas where people may find escape

from crowds and areas intensively developed for all kinds

of activities—must change now that we are in the Space
Age. Now, no place is too remote or too close to home
to be set aside as a park or recreation area. No matter
how farsighted we may think we are, it seems almost cer-
tain that even the best programs for the establishment of
recreation areas and the provision of recreation facilities
[now being] undertaken will seem in adequate by 1970.
——F red A. Seaton, Secretary of the Interior.

 

although the richness and expense of these materials pre-
cludes their general use. Many beautiful patterns and tex-
tural variations are possible. Proper base preparations must
be made and these materials can be laid in a dry sand-and-
cement or mortar bed.
Clay and Stone Screenings—Practical for horseshoe pits and
bocce courts, their relative cohesiveness and stability makes
them suited for baseball infields, horseshoe pits, marble pits,
tennis, or other similar court games areas as well. However,
care must be taken in their use, installation, drainage, and
maintenance.
Grass—Standard surface for athletic fields and park areas.
Its beauty, resiliency and self-healing qualities place it in a
special class. However, careful selection of species, surface,
and subsurface drainage requirements is necessary. This
can be the most expensive material of all over a period of
years because of the constant maintenance and repairs.
Other soft surface materials mentioned earlier have not
proved useful because of inflammability, splintering, water
retention, excessive cost, susceptibility to vandalism, im-
permanence, or instability. Of course, these conclusions
may not hold for less intensively used facilities in other
sections of the country and further investigation might be

desirable. #

46 Days of Christmas,

Do you know why the wren became
the king of all the birds? What is a
koiach, a turté? Do you know about
in Befana, juitomen, the magic mule,
Saint Lucia, Black Peter? If you don’t,
you have missed part of the history and
tradition of Christmas. This beautiful
book is a cycle of Old World songs,
legends, and customs, lovingly collected
by a folklorist and beautifully illus-
trated by Anne Marie Jauss, who was
horn in Germany, lived fourteen years
in Portugal, and now resides in New

York City.

Origami Storybook, Florence Sa-

kade, illustrated by Kazuhiko Sono.

Charles E. Tuttle Company, Rutland,
Vermont. Pp. 32. $4.50.

Origami, the art of Japanese paper
folding, has become a very popular
craft (in some cases, art) in America,
and a number of interesting books have

appeared on that subject, several of
which have been reviewed in RECREA-
TlON (see September 1959). This is the
very first time, however, that this fas-
einating hobby has been correlated with
storytelling—yet it is an obvious com-
hination.

Here are thirteen stories, favorites of
Japanese children, some, like the “Ugly
Duckling,” very well-known to Ameri-
can youngsters. For each, the book
gives detailed sketches of paper folding
to illustrate the story. On the opposite
page of each story is a three-dimen-
sional illustration, showing the finished
paperfolded project. This book really
has to be seen to be believed! The full-
page illustrations are works of art as
well as sample projects! This book
would make a beautiful Christmas pres-
cut for any recreation leader or friend
interested in papcrcraft, stories, or chil-
dren’s books.

The Effective Board, Cyril O. Houle.
Association Press, 291 Broadway, New
York 7. Pp. 167. $3.50.

Dr. Houle has condensed ten years of
study and observation inm a verv ana-

4.96

lytical and practical guide for board
members and executives. Each chapter
is filled with workable suggestions for
the improvement of the philosophy, or-
ganization, and operation of the board.
Among other unique observations, Dr.
Houle points out that the board is cor-
porate and the executive an individual;
that the board as a body is continuous
while the executive is temporary. The
chapter on board-executive relation-
ships has some exceedingly provocative
logic.

In the appendix the reader has an
opportunity to evaluate his own board
situation. A handy cross-reference is
provided to review those sections of the
book which cover the categories where
the score is low. As the author so aptly
puts it, “Boards have a value for all
society since they provide one of the
most significant means for preserving
the democratic spirit.”—-Aian L. Neil.
Superintendent, Recreation and Parks
Department, Montciair, New Jersey.

ACTIVITIES FOR
THE RETARDED

Teaching the Mentally Retarded
Child, Natalie Perry. Columbia Uni-
versity Press, 2960 Broadway, New

The Mentally Retarded Child and
His Parent, Stella Stillson Slaughter.
Harper & Brothers, 49 East 33rd Street,
New YOrk 16. Pp. 174. $3.75.

Here are two excellent new books for
the recreation worker directing activi-
ties for retarded children. Teaching the
Mentally Retarded Chiid can be a valu-
able source book for the recreation
leader or administrator working with
the severely retarded. especially for
those setting up a new program. in ad-
dition to discussing general principles
relating to the teaching of the retarded.
the author points out the importance of
helping the retarded child learn to ex-
press himself through creative play ac-
tivities and describes several that may
be utilized. The chapters on “Music.”
“Crafts,” and “Group Projects" are full
of suggested activities which have been
arranged according to dilliculty.

The reader will find Miss Perry's dis-
cussions of working with parents. vol-

untary and health agencies, and volun-
teers very helpful. included are sample
charts for evaluating pupils which can
be adapted for the use of the recreation
leader and the names of manufacturers
and distributors of toys and games that
have been successfully used.

Mrs. Slaughter’s book, on the other
hand, was written especially for the
parents of retarded children. but any-
one working with the retarded can gain
from reading it. The chapters on “The
Young Mental Relardate” and “The
Mentally Retarded Child and His Lci-
sure” will be of particular interest to
recreation leaders. in these chapters
Mrs. Slaughter gives specific methods
and approaches to use in teaching the
retarded child many different kinds of
games and skills and discusses the im-
portance of early experiences in group
play. She reviews signs and symptoms.
causes, and treatment. discusses the
value and shortcomings of psychologi-
cal tests, and gives specific aids in
teaching the rudiments of reading, writ-
ing, spelling, and arithmetic. This is a
warmly written and thoroughly read-
able book—Doris Berrynian, Nationai

ice on Recreation F or the Hi and Hami-
icapped.

World Costumes, Angela Bradshaw.

Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Avenue,
New York. Pp. 19], illustrated. $8.50.

This beautiful book. originally pub.
lished in England in 1952. is now in its
third—and American—edition. licgin-
ning with Abyssinia and ending with
Yugoslavia, the costumes of each coun-
try are shown in excellent pencil draw-
ings or full color. Special attention is
given to hcaddresses. drapery, designs
used for fabric decorations. and cloth-
ing accessories important to many cos-
tumes.

A special section deals with ancient
costumes: Egyptian. Hebrew. Greek.
Roman, Celtic. and others. The final
section deals with English costumes be-
ginning with the Norman of 1350 and
ending with the costume of a lady in
1900. Those of us here in the United
States will have to use this section for
costumes from 1607 on. since American
costumes are limited to three pages
showing the clothing of lndiuus: Sioux.
Hopi, and Northwest tribes.

TRAMPOLINING . . .

AS A SPORT trampolining is recognized as an event in gymnastic competition by both
the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur Athletic Union. Currently,
local trampoline meets are being held through Y.M.C.A.'s, schools, gymnastic organiza-
tions, and commercial trompoline centers. Trampolining is not only a fine sport in its

own right but the endurance and coordination which it develops are great assets in all
sports.

AS RECREATlON the appeal of the trampoline is well known and persons of all ages
and both sexes are enthusiastic over its use. It offers a challenge to everyone and gives
a feeling of accomplishment from the very first seat drop. The sport requires no requi-
site strength or skill and therefore a trampoline provides hours—and years—of exciting
and fascinating play for everyone.

AS AN EXERCISE trampolines ore unexcelled for the development of balance, muscle
control, endurance, and coordination. Optometrists sometimes recommend the use of
a trampoline for the correction of certain optical prob-
lems. Doctors often recommend the use of a trampo-

- line for spastic ond retarded children to instill physical
' ' and mental confidence, to sharpen reflexes, and de-
A velop coordination. Physical education directors often

/ recommend it for the correction of weight and posture

Anglo-American Folksong Scholar-
ship, D. K. Wilgus. Rutgers University
Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Pp. 466. $7.50.

D. K. Wilgus reviews the major
Anglo-American contributions in the
folksong field. This volume includes a
basic discography and, at the same
time, presents an extensive account of
the argument over the nature and au-
thenticity of folk material which has de-
veloped among the principal scholars.
Is “Home on the Range” a folk song,
and was it composed? This argument
concerns the expert and amateur en-
thusiasts. The layman casually inter-
ested in folk music will benefit from an
understanding of this problem. His
judgment and appreciation will be
sharpened by a reading of this study.

Music—Let’s Have More Of It. Pub-
lications Services, National Board,
YWCA, 600 Lexington Avenue, New
York 22. Pp. 48. Paper, $1.00.

Here is a guide to the development
of musical activities in the groupwork
program. The material is based on the
YWCA’s long experience in this field.
Leadership, selecting materials, music
in worship, and committee organization
are a few of the subjects presented.
This booklet will be a valuable guide to
all concerned with the enrichment and
diversification of groupwork activities.

Songs of the Civil War, Irwin Silber,
Editor. Columbia University Press,
2960 Broadway, New York 27. Pp.
385. $7.50.

This handsome volume is more than
a learned folksong collection Of interest
only to the specialist. Irwin Silber,
compiler and editor, and Jerry Silver-
man, arranger for the piano and guitar
arrangements, have made this volume
useful to the amateur of any age or de-
gree of musical ability. “Goober Peas,”
“Battle Cry Of Freedom,” “When J Ohn-
ny Comes Marching Home,” “Dixie,”
well-known spirituals, and many other
splendid tunes are among the 125 songs
expertly presented in this volume. A
detailed account of each number is also
included; the volumes also lists sources,
references, and provides a complete in-
dex.

The rather surprising efiect of the
collection is its overall spiritual quality
rather than the realistic impressions of
the Civil War one might eXpect. Any-
one just wanting to sing and use this
collection as a program resource should
be delighted with this collection.

MORE MERRY-GO-READING

Although these books are written for
young readers, the recreation leader
can glean many a program idea from
them. (For others, see RECREATION,
November 1960, Page 447.)

THE TALL GRASS Zoo, Winifred and
and Cecil Lubell. Rand-McNally, P.0.
Box 7600, Chicago 80. Unpaged. $2.75.
Your backyard holds animals as fasci-
nating as those in a faraway jungle, and
the wonderful thing is that there are no
cages here. You can watch and touch
the whole menagerie. The Lubells make
an adventurous exploration of the tall
grass zoo, where the smallest occur-
rences become giant findings. Children
will soon realize that the quiet nearness
of everyday insects and plants is indeed
a challenge to learn about.

I LIKE ANIMALS, Written and illus-
trated by Dahlov Ipcar. Alfred A.
Knopf, 501 Madison Avenue, New
York 22. Unpaged. $2.95. Children
do; and this little boy goes through a
whole zoo of animals of all kinds, caged
and uncaged and backyard bug variety.
This is an interesting and enjoyable
way for children to discover their first
view of the animal kingdom. Young-
sters who are already acquainted with
the vast menagerie of creatures on this
green earth will love seeing them color-
fully illustrated and named. They can
read and reread this book and carry
their own portable Noah’s Ark with
them wherever they go.

Noses ARE FOR ROSES, Phoebe, illus-
trated by William A. McCaffery. Mc-
Graw-Hill, 330 West 42nd Street, New
York. Pp. 32. $2.25. In this lovely,
well-illustrated book, Phoebe tells her
younger readers what noses, arms, legs,
heads, hair, and eyes are for. Written
in the special wordings of children, her
sweet and precise descriptions will re-
mind older readers of that child’s sight
they had almost forgotten and lost.

RIKKA AND RINDJI, Dominique Dar-
bois. Follett Publishing, 1010 West
Washington Boulevard, Chicago 7. Pp.
47. $2.00. This warm book about a
young Balinese brother and sister gives
a fine description of their family life
and religious tradition. The two chil-
dren could not be more enjoyable. Mr.
Darbois’s photographs are striking.

THE OTTER TWINS, Barbara Briggs.
David McKay Company, 119 West 40th
Street, New York 18. Pp. 56. $3.00.

The models for the otter twins were two
playful and friendly otters in the San
Francisco’s F leishhacker Zoo. Children
will learn a great deal about nature
while following this battle Of wits of
coyote vs. otters and beaver.
