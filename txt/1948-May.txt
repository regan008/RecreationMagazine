On the eve of going to press we have received
the sudden and sadly distressing news that a
dearly loved fellow worker has left us. We
take this brief opportunity to notify all those who
came to know and love her during her thirty'six
years of service to recreation and her many
years as managing editor of 'Recreation. On
the following pages of this insert, a co-worker
speaks for us all.

In the next issue of the magazine we shall
attempt to give 'Doice to the sincere tribute to
Mbbie Gondit “which we carry in our hearts.

They Say D D b

jHEY SAY that Abbie Condit died last Sunday. They say

that she had lobar pneumonia, and that her heart gave
up and stopped beating.

We who knew Abbie know it isn’t so. Her heart would
never give up. Not Abbie’sl

There are those of us who will always hear her laugh
reverberate through this office—her hearty, robust laugh
that reached every corner. We shall still turn and look
toward her desk, and laugh with her, not knowing why, but
caught up in her infectious gaiety.

There are those of us who will look for her at luncheons,
to pass our ice cream over to her. We shall look around at
the Congress, and still say “Where’s Abbie?” We shall still
see Abbie coming to breakfast with a small bunch of wild
flowers she’d picked before any of us were awake. See her
shelling peas out under a tree; hunting for wild strawberries
—and eating shortcake with that rich enjoyment she gave

to everything.

On keeping 01502

There is tremendous need for space for recreation. There is tre-

mendous need for baseballs, bats and all kinds of recreation things.

But the space, the centers, the things should
create an inner spirit of preventing children
from going dead, of keeping youth really keen,
of making it impossible for young married folks
to feel they have gone stale, of helping old peo-
ple in their wisdom to chuckle and be willing to
a be as happy as little children.

All living cannot be taken out of the home, the

church, the club, the factory, the store and trans-
ferred and concentrated in places with bright
electric lights marked “Recreation Centers.”

There’s got to be a degree of living pretty
nearly everywhere or there’s not going to be _
much of living anywhere. Because golf and ten-
nis and all kinds of games played by “dead”
people are not really games.

The great job of recreation spaces, recreation centers, recreation

things, recreation leaders is to keep people alive everywhere.

The great job of the recreation movement is to find the people who

have the gift of helping to keep all of time and existence alive.

We get more and more of mechanism. Men
become more and more perfect mechanisms in
using the automobiles, the airplanes, the sub-
marines they have created. It becomes increas-
ingly important that, with the multiplication of
societies and agencies and boards, with the grow-
ing complexities of all our machinery, we help
man himself at the center to keep out of the
revolving machinery long enough each day to
live and to realize that keeping himself living

and others living is more important than all the

What will it profit the universe if we develop the
most complete and the most perfect machinery
and build ourselves into machines at the center—
very perfect machines but still machines—and pi-
oneer man becomes relatively smaller and smaller
and relatively more and more insignificant?

If man himself becomes a machine we have a

men helping each other cooperatively to remain alive in the universe.

Everybody Dances

 

“Folk dancing is the spirit of democracy set to music ’.’

IRVING SPERGEL

OLK DANCING BRINGS together Americans of
Fthe most diverse origins. Here, people of dif-
ferent races, nationalities, and religions dance to
the folk rhythms of all lands. They dance a Danish
Polka, an Italian Danza, or a plain old American
Square. All have fun as they shout and clap and
sing; and everybody dances.

At the folk dance there is no problem of race
discrimination or group hatred. There is friendly
accord as everyone participates on equal terms in
the swiftness and exuberance of the dance. But it
is even more than this. In each dance it is as if
every person on the floor is made to feel the very
character and spirit of the nationality or people
from which the dance has sprung. If the dancer
is doing a Hooshig Mooshig, he feels as if he is an
Armenian; if the music is for a Hopak, he is a
Ukrainian; if he is dancing the Danish Little Man
in a Fix, he, of course, has to be a Danish little
man in a fix. To dance the dances of other na—
tions is to know and accept these other peoples as
equal fellow humans.

At a folk dance there is no need to teach and
repeat over and over again the dry classroom les-
son that all persons are equal. Here it becomes a
joyous experience which participants can never
forget. Whoever comes to a folk dance must carry
away some part of this exulting spirit of friendship.

I remember the story of a girl who was taken
by a cousin to her first folk dance. Since early
childhood she had been taught to regard Negroes
as inferior beings. When she walked on to the
dance 'fioor, she was shocked and annoyed at the
sight of several Negroes among the dancers. Only

MAY 1948

the certainty that an abrupt departure would em-
barrass her in the eyes of her host prevented her
from leaving. She sought out white partners and
got through a Swedish Hambo and a Ukrainian
Hopak without mishap.

The third dance was an American Square and,
with the shifting of partners, she found herself
with a Negro. However, the spell of the music
and the proximity of the gay company had been

n working their effect. She was no longer disturbed

by the color of her partner’s skin. She saw him
simply as another gay smiling figure. She spoke
with him and discovered he was a graduate stu-
dent from_a local university.

A Jewish boy of my acquaintance had a similar
experience. He had been raised in an orthodox
home, and his friends and interests were restricted
to those of his own religious and cultural back—
ground. Through the years a wall of distrust for
people of other nationalities had been built around
him. On this particular evening he had walked in
among the dancers before he found out that the
dance was not sponsored by a Jewish organization.

But it was too late. As he turned to leave, a
pretty dark-haired girl in need of a partner in-
sisted that he join her. Ill-at—ease, he was forced
to the center of the floor. He stumbled along as
he tried both to keep time with the music and
extricate himself from an unfortunate situation.
However, the infectious rhythms were not to be
denied. He began to relax and enjoy himself.
His spirits were not at all dampened by the dis-
covery that he was dancing with a Rose Ferrucci.

The transformations which took place in the

51

young girl and the jewish boy are not unusual.
They have happened time and again. False ideas
and warped emotions, products of years of narrow
community infiue'nce, are changed in the swift
passing of a three-hour session. Anti-Semiti’sm,
Anti-Catholicism, and Jim Crowism disappear. A
sense of the similarity of all peoples is born from
the fun and informality of folk dancing.

Although improving group relations has been
an important contribution of folk dancing, it has
served communities, groups and individuals in
other ways. During the war years, when USO
officials found that popular dancing attracted too
few servicemen, folk dancing sessions were ar-
ranged—~—and the turnouts were tremendous. Since
the war it has served as a therapeutic activity in re-
habilitating physically and psychologically wounded
servicemen. It is a vigorous form of exercise.
Three hours of continuous folk dancing are suffi-
cient to give any beginner assorted aches and pains
the following morning.

Folk dancing is as old as the folkways from
which it springs. From the beginning of time, man
has devised religious and esthetic bodily move—
ments set to the rhythm and the beat of the drum.
No land has lacked its native dances. In America
we have had Indian, cowboy, and square dances.
The square dance springs from a conglomeration
of European folk dances. Its origin can be traced
to the influence of the European peoples who came
to America in the early colonial days. In the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, immigrants
came over in great'waves and brought with them
a myriad of dances from the old country. But, at
first, each group restricted its folk dancing to a
particular national or sectional variety. It is only
recently that successful efforts have been made to
introduce the dances of other lands to all groups.

It was not until the folk dancing sessions at the
New York W orld’s Fair in 1939 that the popular—
ity of folk dancing of other countries was definitely
acknowledged. Primarily responsible for this
achievement was Michael Herman, who, during
the war, led, the folk dancing affairs at Camp
Upton. In 1940 he and his wife established the
New York Community Folk Dance Center in
Manhattan. Since then it has grown into the
largest and most influential organization of its kind
in the country, having a membership list of ten
thousand pe0ple.

Folk dancing groups are found in at least
twenty-four states throughout the country. In the
big cities and in rural areas, on college campuses
and in high schools, in spacious halls and small
spare rooms the movement has grown.

52

There is a State Folk Dance Federation of Cali-
fornia, with sixty member groups. All told'there
are more than sixty thousand -men and women
from every conceivable station in life enrolled as
members of folk dance societies in the country.
Truck drivers, professors, housewives, chorus
girls, business men, students, farmhands, and office
clerks come to enjoy the experience of getting
along with each other.

Folk dancing is known in many countries as a
means of cementing friendly relations. While in
the Army, I made the acquaintance of an old
Frenchman who lived in a village, high in the
French Alps. He spoke with pride of the folk
dancing custom which prevailed among the vil-
lagers. Each Sunday, from eleven in the morning
until'eleven at night, everyone who was not con-
fined to a wheel chair, an invalid’s bed, or a baby’s
crib danced in the main square. He claimed that
folk dancing kept the village peace. He said that
during the week the peasants quarrelled with one
another over rights to grazing land; they were on
bad terms with the local officials who too strictly
enforced government regulations on raising and
marketing livestock. My friend waggishly sug-
gested that the high altitudes aroused their tem—
pers. He added:

“You see, on Sundays we dance so hard and
long we sweat off and lose our ill tempers. By the
end of the day we have learned to enjoy our neigh-
bor’s company. We have stored up enough peace
and goodwill to last for the entire week.”

Folk dancing is one of the best ways of bring-
ing peoples of different backgrounds together. '
Books and preachments, long lectures and ingen-
ious methods of indoctrination are but feeble sec—
ondary efforts. It improves intergroup relations
because ordinary men and women are brought into
actual face to face participation on full and equal
terms in a common activity.

Folk dancing is the spirit of democracy set to
music and bodily movement. It is a microcosm of
a democratic society—which can exist only as its

people live in harmony and understanding with
each other.

 

“In America, because we are so close to the
frontier period, we are just awakening to our rich
heritage of achievements and blending cultures——
our history. We are beginning to link together
the separate prides and outlooks into a nation of
one people with the heritage of all.”

From Preservation of H istory.

RECREATION

During a recent European tour, the author
was impressed with the widespread enjoyment
of hiking in countries visited. Here she points
out ways of getting real pleasure from this
simple activity which is available to everyone.

HOW TO HIKE

Betty Carlson

0 YOU DON’T like to hike ?—Well, maybe you Start out in a relaxed manner, have no specific goal

don’t know how. Hiking is not merely walk_ in mind, no set time to return; take your time, look
around, just let the beauty of the day carry you on.

ing; not merely a physical activity in which you
stride along the road thinking—“My this is good
for me. Isn’t this wonderful exercise?” It IS
wonderful exercise, but if you limit your thoughts
to just that, you will think of your hike as some-
thing arduous, something you have to do, and you
will soon become bored or fatigued.

To get the true zest out of hiking, I often read
a little Thoreau before striking out. It is surpris-
ing how a chapter or two from Walden will put
you in a meditative frame of mind, and will help
to erase some of your daily tensions or worries.
The first line of preparation for a hike that is to
be more than mere walking is to get your mind in
a receptive and contented mood. Experiment with
the above prescription for a bit of reading.

For warm weather hiking wear a loose, baggy
jacket with wide, deep pockets to pack along your
lunch, a sketching pad and pencil, a newspaper,
and a ’kerchief. You will bulge slightly on the
'sides, but small matter—where you are going;
and it is so much better than carrying your im—
pedimenta in your hands.

Prepare yourself a tasty lunch of several sand—
wiches with your favorite cheese and cold meat,
and also include some cookies and an apple. Even
though you are not an artist or writer, include
the sketching pad and pencil. You will be sur-
prised at the number of things you will want to
record. Include the newspaper to sit on; not to
read. If you are planning to READ the newspaper
on some grassy hill—top overlooking a sweet val-

 

MAY 1948 I 53

ley, you may put down this article; this is not for
you. The ’kerchief may be used to carry home
berries, or for most any purpose. Wear comfor-
table shoes, sturdy socks, well-made slacks (dun-
garees are ideal), a skivvy shirt next to your skin,
cool underclothing, and a sport shirt with an open
collar. Frankly, it matters little what you wear,
but do be comfortable. You are ready to take off.

Start down the road in a relaxed manner; have
no set time to return, no specific goal in mind—
just let the beauty of the day carry you on. Steer
- for a non—congested area as soon as you can; it
is difficult to get into a relaxed mood when you
are hemmed in by people, buildings, and traffic.
If you live in a large city, take the bus or street-
car to the end of the line, and then begin your hike.
Don’t exhaust yourself lighting city traffic. Once
away from the city proper you soon should happen
upon a duiet road.

Take your time, look around, stop and watch
a couple of birds grubbing for supper, maybe
sketch an unusual tree, find a straight stretch in
the road and hike briskly; and all the time feel
yourself a part of this quiet scene. Don’t be afraid
of your own thoughts, let your mind roam freely,
look to the sky, listen for different sounds, respond
to the rhythm of your step.

Don’t walk until you are exhausted. Rest fre-
quently; and when your sense of timing tells you
it is high noon, start scouting for the ideal spot
in which to pause and enjoy those sandwiches. In
looking around, there are several things to keep in
mind: first and above all, you want a lovely view;
so start looking up. Then consider the wind and
the position of the sun. Try to pick a grassy knoll,
sheltered from the wind, high on a hill, with the
sun shining directly down on you; and don’t for-
.get the view.

You will have much fun hunting this spot, and
often times just the place you want will be quite
inaccessible; but, I wager, if you are a real hiker,
you will make it.

Once you enter your private outdoor dining
room, be particular about details. Clear off a spot,
place some twigs on the ground against a fairly
good-sized rock, spread your newspaper, take off
your jacket, get out your luncheon, and settle back
to enjoy a banquet. You will feel like a king—
at least you are king of that knoll or mountain.
You will marvel at the delicious fiavor of your
sandwiches, the cookies will be so much honey,
and the apple, sheer ambrosia.

After you have satisfied your appetite, adjust
your position slightly, and settle back and com-
pletely relax. For the supreme feeling of all, close

54

your eyes and try to imagine your co-workers in
the city, pushing their way through the cafeteria
line, gulping down a meager bowl of soup, fight-
ing their way through crowds, and rushing back to
the office. You better go home and read a little
more from Thoreau; you are harboring mean
thoughts!

This is all well and good for warm weather,
you are thinking, but What do you do the other
six months of the year? Do not let the coming of
winter frighten you away from hiking. Of course,
you will have to make some radical changes in
the procedure suggested above, but the first idea
still goes. Prepare yourself in the same way as
for the fair weather hike. Again try a bit of
thoughtful reading to put you in_ the right mood,
perhaps one of Emerson’s essays. Dress yourself
in your warmest clothing—sweater under your
jacket, a scarf, warm gloves, ski pants, and sturdy
boots. If it is definitely cold, start out hiking
briskly. You will soon warm up if you have
dressed carefully. One of the main things in a
winter hike is to keep it short, unless you are
conditioned to being outdoors in cold weather.
You are moving so briskly you probably will get
just as much exercise as on a long leisurely hike
on a warm summer day.

You may not do much leisurely thinking on the
Winter hike because of this need for briskness; but
the ideal time for that comes after the hike. You
can’t help but feel satisfaction when you come
back into your room. It’s cozy and warm inside,
and you particularly appreciate it after your taste
of the out-of-—doors. Your feeling of stuffiness will
be gone. Stimulated by the reading you did be-
fore, and by the fresh air and exercise that you
have just had, you will be happily surprised at
the alertness of your mind. This combination of
reading, hiking, and thinking can do a creditable
job toward filling in those dangerous off hours
when you do not know what to do with your time.

Once you develop the hiking habit, you will find
no such thing as an uninteresting, unplanned day.
stretching ahead of you. You will always have
something different and interesting to look forward
to when you know your day is going to include a
hike. Hiking can be and is fun, be it a long tour,
or a short walk, in a blizzard, or on a sunny beach,
with a crowd, or by yourself. It is so easy for too
many of us to neglect so obvious an activity as this.

Emerson wrote in one of his essays that we have
keys to all doors; therefore, let’s get outside and
explore. Who knows, we might find one on our
next hike that has been closed to us in all our
previous years.

A Short Tale of Sprout

Ralph Griffin

Eleven years old

I WAS ON MY way to school on a morning in
May when I rescued Sprout from a bunch of
boys who had just stoned to death his mother and
two of the baby birds in the nest, and destroyed
his nest, too. The Father Brown Thrasher was
frantic in his helplessness, but I was able to save
one of the babies who had hopped over in the
bushes and hid. Soon as I picked him up I knew
I .was going to name him Sprout; it fitted the
little fellow so perfectly. He was all pin-feathers
with a little half inch long sprout of a tail.

From his first home on the school yard, he came
to his new home with me that afternoon to the
Hillsborough River State Park. My two sisters
and I caught grasshoppers morning and night for
him for three days. As we had to leave enough
grasshoppers for my mother to feed him while we
were at school, it meant that we really had to find
those grasshoppers, because he certainly had a
constant appetite.

The third evening we noticed that he seemed
to be losing his strength and growing weaker,
though we were feeding him all we were able to
get for him. It worried us because we were all so
fond 6f him, but it seems that we were not the
only ones that were worried over Sprout. A
Mother Brown Thrasher in our yard“ that had
been building her own nest, heard his cry too. I
still cannot understand how she was able to tell
by his cry that he was a Brown Thrasher but she
did because at that time our whole yard sounded
like a Baby Nursery, with the cries of all the dif-
ferent kinds of young birds all crying at once for
their mothers. His cries were soon too much for
her and she let her own nest building go for the
time being and spent the whole afternoon on the
outside sill of our screened porch, calling and
coaxing to him. When I came in from school he
was out of. the canary cage I had put him in, and
down on the floor as near to her as the screen

The next "morning he was almost too weak to
have any interest in eating; but early as it was,
the Mother Brown Thrasher was outside of the
porch again, calling to him and trying so hard to
get into him. It was then that I decided to give
her a chance to see if she could do anything for
him, though we had never heard of a bird adopt-
ing another bird’s young as her own. There was
a chance she might be able to do more for him
than we could; she was so anxious to try anyway.
I put him in his box, with the nest I had made,
up in a large myrtle bush right by the porch and
hurried back inside. I had hardly returned to the
house and got to a window to watch before the
Mother Thrasher flew up to the box to look at
him and then off she dashed. She was back in a
minute with four bugs and a worm in her bill. It’s
a sight I’ll never forget—a fat worm hanging half

out of her bill, the grasshopper legs sticking out
both sides of her bill. She had all she could pos-
sibly carry. Up she jumped to his box and down
his throat it all went. She said something to him
and away she went again; and back again-with all
she could carry. This serving consisted of berries

with a large bug. She fed him so much he soon
fell asleep, and there she sat up above him, calling
to him with her bill full. Every time she’d call him
she’d drop a berry and have to jump down for it
again. She was rewarded though for all her work
because when he awoke he was so full of pep she
soon had coaxed him down out of the tree. I put
him back up in the box three times but when I
had to go help my mother she got him down, took
him over in the myrtle hedge, and hid him there.

I could hardly bear losing him but finally de-
cided to let her have her chance at raising him
since she wanted him so badly. She could do so
much more for him than I could. We were able to
see him over in the hedge without going too near
to him; and his adopted mother certainly worked

55

to feed him. It seemed as if she never ceased hunt-
ing food for him; she would even be out in the

rain dashing around hunting food.

Three days after she took him off, the heavy
rains started. We were all worried because we
were sure he would never be able to live through
those downpours without a nest. Finally, I went
out in the rain to look for them, and I found them
easily enough; she had him up in an oak tree,
covering him with her feathers. I never worried

over him anymore.

When he was half feathered out and could get
around good, he decided he wanted to go off with
her every time when she’d go off to get food, and
would run halfway out in the yard; and then she
would have to whip him back with her wings until
she could get him up into his tree again. Much
as she loved and spoiled him at times, he received

his discipline too.

When he was big enough to fly and could feed
himself, she left him and went back to her own
neglected nest which she had been building. The
first week she left him he was a very sad and

lonely bird, and just couldn’t believe what had ’

happened to him. After a few days he came to
accept it and we have been feeding him around
our door ever since.

It took two of us to give him his second chance
at life. The credit all goes to a very kind hearted
Mother bird, though I think we will always think
of him as our own special little Sprout.

The Year’s at the Spring!

"Can you see brighter signal fires blazing from
the hills? This is the season for hearts to become
warm again. The seeds of hiking, fishing, and
camping are pushing through the crust of artifi-
ciality. Camp leaders are planning to bring child-
hood a better harvest.

“If a camp means more than the counting of
noses, it must mean a society which works, ex-
plores, and experiments. Anyone who has visited
a real camp knows that there is no loafing. Every-
one is heart and soul interested in work. Camp
provides the simple life. . . . It is a community
which sends its citizens back home with better
habits, better moral codes,‘ better social thought
and action, and better attitudes and aspirations.”
—Dr. William Gould Vinal, University of Massa-
chusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts.

ARENTS WANT THEIR children to play fair, to

do unto others as they would be done by,
and many parents think they’ve brought them up
this way until a wave of religious or racial preju-
dice hits the neighborhood.

There are two ways to deal with prejudice.
One is to ignore it. One is to face it.

To face prejudice is the only way to combat it,
in the opinion of many educators and group lead-
ers. They say that it is natural to have prejudices,
that the first step in getting rid of them is to know
that we have them. Then, they say, we can stop
passing them on.

Intercultural programs for children, as Helen
Trager reminds us, have been geared to adult ideas
of what children are like and what they need. For
years, she says, the attitude toward prejudice has
been either “Let’s do nothing, because we don’t
know what to do” or “Let’s do something about
it without knowing what it is.”

Mrs. Trager heads the department of age-level
studies of the Bureau- of Intercultural Education
and is now directing a research study known as
“The Philadelphia Early Childhood Project.”
Kindergarten and first and second grades in five
public schools are the laboratory for this study,
conducted jointly by the Philadelphia public
schools and the bureau, in cooperation with the
Research Center for Group Dynamics, Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology.

Mrs. Trager says that the schools are an “ex-
cellent laboratory for the study of prejudice.” The
children are Negro, white and Oriental; Catholic,
Jewish and Protestant; Italian, central European,
English and Scotch—Irish in family origin.

The idea is to find out—from children, not from
books—how children feel about themselves in their
own group, and toward other groups; what they
do and say when they fight and call names, and
after that to find out why.

Here is a cross-section of remarks jotted down

RECREATION

9 Playgrounds*

by teachers, printed by the bureau in a leaflet de-
scribing the first years. They appear under the
heading, “Why Wait Till the Children Grow Up P”

RALPH: Joey called me a frog face. He’s a
lousy Polack!

CLARA: There’s a Mary on my street. She goes
to Catholic school. My mother says it’s a shame
she’s a Catholic.

ALICE: But a colored girl can’t be first in line!

FRANK (in a temper tantrum, kicking the teach-
er who has been insisting that he tidy a cup-
board he purposely upset) : You better stop meSs-
in’ wi’ me. You white cracker!

BARBARA: Paul called me a dirty Jew.

PAUL: I didn’t say it for spite. I was only
playing.

LOUISE: Do you visit Anna when she is sick?

JANE: No-o——. She’s only the maid.

BETTY: We’re moving to the country soon. I’ll
go to the new school then. I won’t have to play
with colored kids.

Now children have been shrilling taunts for at
least a thousand years and how much of this sad
little documentary is imitative and meaningless,
how much of it is mixed up with feelings of family
status, with the children’s own uncertainties and
fears, how much of it is tied up with a stage of
growth, no one yet knows.

Until the project finds out how children get this
way, its sponsors are not ready to say what can
be done about it. The next step, says Mrs. Trager,
is to work with teachers to “create classroom
methods and materials intended to build demo-
cratic attitudes,” and then to try these out to see
which ones work.

In. common with all thoughtful persons, the
sponsors of the Philadelphia project wish to see
children “able to live and play, untroubled by bar-
riers of social class, religion; nationality, race.”
The first-hand approach and the assistance of
teachers in this study make it unique, Mrs. Trager

school then. I won’t have to play with colored kids.”

tells us. This is the first of a series of intensive
research studies planned by the bureau in cooper-

ation with public schools.
* >|< >1:

Judging by the name-calling just quoted, there
may be something in parental claims that children
find on the playground prejudices neither felt nor
expressed at home.

Again there are such echoes of home attitudes
as Clara’s taunt, reinforced by, “My mother says

. .” and Jane’s “No-o—-. She’s only the maid.”
These are reminders of that much-quoted comment
by Sister Mary de Lourdes that “our prejudices
begin to tell on children from the seventh month
on; the tone of voice rather than the word itself
carries meaning to them.”

In other words, as in every aspect of living, it
isn’t what we say, it is what we feel that is con-
veyed to children. This reporter doubts that the
problem of prejudice ,is one to be solved with our
heads. In combating prejudice, we are dealing not
with thought but with emotions. It is our own
guess that the success of intercultural, programs
lies less in the methods than in the conviction of
brotherhood, deeply felt, by the people who lead
them. Thinking is needed. Action is needed.

But when the last treatise is written to prove
that the ‘color of our skin is an accident of climate
and that all races have a common origin, we shall
still have to accept the ancient teaching that all
men are brothers. We shall be no nearer to good—
will among men until we love our neighbors as
ourselves. In facing prejudice, the place to start is
in ourselves. '

Civic Center
in the North

Evelyn E. Kaplan

N A SMALL town of six thousand, on the coast
I of Alaska, a new civic center was opened last
September. This happened in the city of Ketchi-
kan, built among the hills and along the sea, where
the rainfall exceeds I 50 inches a year. In this sec-
tion of the North country there are less than two
months of the year when rain and cloudiness do
not prevail. Ketchikan’s main industries are fish—

ing and lumbering, with most of the business car-
“ ried on during the spring and summer. '

' Much of the town is hilly and there is very lit-
tle level space in which children can play, unless
they take to the streets. Teen-agers have had no
place of their own, and juvenile delinquency posed
a problem until the opening of the civic center.
Since then, according to the Chief of Police, not a
single case has been reported.

Getting the new center started Was not an easy
task for, here, as in all Alaskan towns, there is a
great lack of money for purchases or projects.
However, after long consideration, the city de—
cided to purchase the building, and the people of
Ketchikan, realizing the importance of such a pro j-
ect—especially in these parts—pledged their full
support.

The center was officially Opened to the public
with an “Open House,” and since then an active
program has grown steadily. Staff consists solely
of a director, and the center is closed only on
Monday—her day off. There is no paid janitor,
but members of the boys’ club help with janitorial

services. Members of the girls’ club relieve in the,

canteen, which is operated by the teen-age group.

A program for four to twelve-year-olds consists
of table and group games, spelling bees, sack races,
roller skating, ball games, a junior choral group,
story reading hour, crayon coloring, and basket

58

craft. Junior movies are shown once weekly, with
pictures chosen especially for’that age group. A
monthly birthday club for the children honors
them with a huge cake with their names inscribed.
All children in the community take part in this
celebration and in other activities for that age
group. The junior program is put on in the after-
noons ; teen-agers take over in the evenings.

The teen program includes planned and super-
vised activities, such as: teen-age dances every
Friday night; a teen—age choral group, dance in-
struction class, photography club, an active Civic
Center Girls’ Club and Civic Center Boys’ Club;
classes in boxing, archery, fishing; ping pong, bad-
minton, roller skating, table games, reading hours,
basketball; a class in shellcraft, leather and copper
work {dances for visiting basketball teams.

Activities for adults take the form of ping pong,
roller skating, community singing, crafts classes
and a monthly dance.

The center has become the meeting place for
Boy and Girl Scouts, and headquarters for civic
affairs, but rentals that might in any way interfere
with basic activities for community boys and girls
are not encouraged. All persons, regardless of
race, color or creed, are invited to attend activities
at the center, and a definite time is set aside for
the various age groups. The community has a
marked native population but thus far no diffi-
culties have arisen, and the children work and play
happily together. An attempt is made to give the
children an opportunity to be of some service to
the community, and to encourage them to sponsor
projects and assume community responsibilities.

Plans for expansion of program to further meet
the needs of juniors, teen—agers and adults of the
community will be outlined at a later date.

 

Members of girls” club enjoy serving in the popular
canteen which is operated by the teen-age group . . .

To “0 Honor...

LAN EARLY THIS year to do honor to Joseph Lee—the father of recreation in
America, of whom Franklin D. Roosevelt was moved to say:

“Because of his life work
Children are happier;
Youth is better served;
Men and women
Live more richly.

“His genius lay not alone
in his philosophy but in
forging the machinery to
make recreation a vital

 

part of American life.”

Use the last Friday in July, which has been set aside as a memorial day to
“The Godfather of Play,” to make sure that all—young and old—get acquainted with
Joseph Lee as a warm, human, fun-loving person. Refresh their memories regarding
his contribution to them and to our age. Make it possible.for everyone tb gather for
joyous celebration. Mayors sometimes issue oHicial proclamations for the day. Some
cities, such as San Francisco, set aside a full week in which to do him honor, the
recreation department officially sponsoring a series of dedicated events and inviting
all recreational agencies of the city to participate . . .

Before planning your program, whether it be for a day or a week, read or re-read
Play in Education, by Joseph Lee; it’s delightful; it’s a “must”! Also write to the
National Recreation Association for the following free bulletins: Script Regarding
the Life‘of Joseph Lee, M. B. 1107; Children Need a Place to Play (pageant), M. B.
1235; The Pursuit of Joy (pageant), M. B. 1553; and A Few of Joseph Lee’s Favorite
Games, M. B. 1236. Watch for issue number six of the 1948 Playground Summer
Notebook which contains detailed suggestions for program; if you haven’t subscribed
for the Notebook, do so now.

Read up on how other cities have celebrated Joseph Lee Day. The magazine
RECREATION will give you lots of ideas. Consult the following issues in your local
school, college or public library: December 1937—issue devoted entirely to Joseph
Lee; November 1939—Spirit of Joseph Lee Day; May 1940—Doing It the Joseph
Lee Way, A Tribute to Joseph Lee; June l94l—Joseph Lee Day, 1941; July 1943—-
Joseph Lee Day in San Francisco, Joseph Lee’s Favorite Games; October 1943——
Joseph Lee Day 1943; June 1944—Joseph Lee Day, July 28, 1944; April 1945—
Joseph Lee Day, 1944; May 1946—To Honor Joseph Lee, This Day Is Ours; May
194-7—F or Joseph Lee. The Reader’s Digest, January 1940, carries a line article

entitled “Godfather of Play.”

As a part of planning:
1. Talk to the mayor and try to arrange an official proclamation in your town.

59

2. Invite all local groups to cooperate in making this a city~wide celebration.

3. Talk to the editor of your local paper. Tell him your plans andarrange for
news coverage. Try to get an editorial on Joseph Lee. (Have information at hand to

give to the editor.)

4. Talk to your local radio station people and try to get their cooperation in
arranging a special program. (See article on working with your local station—A
Two-Way Street, by Robert Hutchings-n-in March RECREATION.)

5. Plan “Open House” on all playgrounds, and get the youngsters’Ihelp'in planning
a program. Tell them stories of Joseph Lee, the man whom they are to honor.

6. Plan special Joseph Lee Day material for your bulletin boards; turn your
crafters loose on making some effective posters to place about the town.

Make it a bang-up affair with everyone participating—the kind that Joseph Lee,

himself, would enjoy hugely. He once said:

‘ I
‘ W e do not cease playing because we are old; we grow old because we cease

playing.”

 

Recreation Salaries . .‘

$

HE RECREATION PROFESSION is a very young
Tone compared with other fields Open tO the
man or woman choosing a career today. Law,
medicine, education—in each Of these professions
the neophyte can readily determine, in a general
way, what opportunities are presented and what
he can reasonably expect tO be earning after five
or ten years. We who earn our living in recrea-
tion, however, are in the possibly unfortunate, but
nevertheless interesting, position Of having tO carve
our own niche in the framework Of society.

Enormous strides in establishing standards for
recreation personnel have been made since the
turn of the century, but conditions are still in a
state Of flux. More and more cities are coming to
realize the importance Of securing trained leaders
for a complete year-round recreation program
and, in line with this trend, one Of the questions
most frequently asked 6f the National Recreation
Association is “\‘Vhat should we pay our recrea-
tion personnel ?”

T 0 answer this question intelligently, it is nec—

A Study Conducted by

essary to know what salaries are currently being
paid throughout the country. The National Recre—
ation Association has recently made a limited sur-
vey to Obtain information on this point and, feel-
ing that the results are Of general interest to rec-
reation‘workers, we 'are passing them on to the
readers Of RECREATION.

Questionnaires were sent tO 207 cities known tO
have active recreation programs, and replies were
received from 112 recreation departments in 109
cities and 2 counties. All were public recreation
departments with one exception-ma private agency

 

RECREATION

furnishing recreation service to the general public.
The cities reporting range in population from
6,887 to 3,396,808 (1940 census). Thirty-six
states and more than 6000 workers are represented
in the survey.

In tabulating salaries, the highest, lowest and
median salaries reported for each position were
recorded. The median was used, rather than the
average, to obviate the possibility of undue weight-
ing by an extremely high or extremely low salary.
(“Median” is defined as a point so chosen in a
series that one-half the individuals in the series
lie on one side of it and one-half on the other.
Thus, 13 would be the median between I and 25.)
Where an even number of salaries was recorded,
the higher, rather than the lower, was taken as
the median (i.e.: if four departments reported sal—
aries of $3000, $2600, $2400 and $2200 respec-
tively for a given position, the median was re—
corded as $2600). Where the maximum and mini-
mum salary for a given position was reported,
but not the amount paid the present incumbent, an
amount halfway between the two extremes was
arbitrarily assigned to that worker. No requests
for additional information were made and prac—
tically no editing of reports was done. Thus the
interpretation of titles has been left entirely to the
discretion of the person filling out the report form.

Where cost-of-living bonuses were reported
separately, they were included as part of the
worker’s salary. Such bonuses were reported by
sixteen departments. In some cases, they repre-
sented a percentage of salary (59% for one month
was the highest figure reported) and in some cases
a flat sum granted to one or more of the depart-
ment staff ($708 to the executive and assistant
executive in one year was the largest amount
reported).

In such responsible positions as executive, as-
sistant executive and general supervisor, very few
departments reported more than one worker.
However, more than 889 playground and commu-
nity center directors and 337 recreation leaders
and assistants were reported employed on a full-
time year-round basis by the various departments.
Where the number employed by a department was
not stated, one worker was assumed for the posi-
tion, although there were probably several more.

In analyzing this survey, it should be borne in
mind that it is intended to provide only a general
indication of salaries currently being paid to recre—
ation workers and is by no means definitive. Par-
ticularly in the brackets where fewer than fifteen
departments are reporting, the median might well
be substantially altered by the inclusion of addi-

MAY 1948

 

tional departments. The highest and lowest figures
for any given position are, of course, subject to
change by the addition of only one report. How-
ever, it is believed that the cities reporting are
sufficiently representative to give a reasonably ac-
curate picture wherever fifteen or more depart-
ments have reported.

PART II
PART-TIME AND SEASONAL WORKERS

The cities reporting in Part II of the survey are
not identical with those in Part I because several
departments listed only full-time workers; also, a
few reports that were received too late for consid-
eration in Part I have been included in Part II.
The population range and geographical distribu-
tion of the cities covered remain substantially the
same. The tabulations represent reports from 101

recreation departments in 99 cities and 2 counties,‘

employing more than 4,370 part-time and seasonal
workers.

Some editing has been done in this section of
the report because it was apparent that several
departments had misclassilied their workers, ac-
cording to the generally accepted standards. For
example, one department reported a very large
number of city-wide supervisors of playgrounds
and no playground directors. In such cases as this,
the reclassification of the workers seemed entirely
justified, in the interest of accuracy.

The tabulations made include playground direc-
tors, community center directors, recreation lead-
ers and assistants, specialists and swimming in-
structors. Music, drama, dancing, arts and crafts,
nature and athletic leaders, as well as leaders of
girls’ and women’s and boys’ and men’s work,
have been' classified as specialists. Lifeguards have
not been included unless it was stated or clearly
implied that their duties included swimming in-
struction. The small number of community center
directors recorded is attributed, in part, to the fact

MAY 1948‘

that in many departments the playground director
also supervises the community center. Where one
individual has been reported as having this dual
responsibility, he has been classified as a play-
ground director. ’

Since no provision was made on the report
form for recording the number of hours devoted
to recreation duties, the figures recorded under
“hourly” and “class or evening” give the most. ac-
curate picture of salaries currently being paid part-
time recreation workers. Where very low salaries
are reported for a week, month or other period,
it is probable that these workers devoted only a
limited number of hours to recreation duties. How-
ever, where the salaries reported are fairly high,
it is reasonable to assume that the workers were
on a full-time basis during the period covered by
the report.

In recreation, as in education, attracting the
highest type of man and woman to the profession
is becoming a serious problem in these days of

high industrial wages. The Association has pre-
sented this report in the hope that it may help to
lay the groundwork for a satisfactory set of sal-
ary standards for recreation personnel. Your
comments and suggestions on the material and the
form of presentation will be most welcome. Our
thanks to the executives and staff members who
took time from their busy days to fill out the report
form. Without their cooperation, such studies as
this could not be made.

HE CITY OF Racine was certainly “ball-minded”

last summer, as evidenced by the fact that
there were 240 teams in various municipal leagues
sponsored by the recreation department. The types
of ball played included slowpitch and fastpitch
softball, and baseball. Both men and women played
in the leagues which ranged from Cadet Girls to
the “Old Timers.” But what interests us here is
the league of the Cadet Girls, and the organization
of girls of junior high school age for playing
regulation softball.

Problems beset the recreation department from
the start. Because of a ruling of the Wisconsin
Interscholastic Athletic Association, girls in Wis-
consin schools are not permitted to compete in
athletic activities as representatives of their
schools. Yet, we felt that the school was the unit
with which to start in order to contact the girls
who might be interested in playing ball during
summer vacation. By gaining permission from the
school board to talk to them in after-school meet—
ings, it was possible for us to outline our program.

The Cadet League was to be governed as any
adult league, under the jurisdiction of the recrea-
tion department. Each team was to have a mana-

ger, preferably an adult, and a roster of a recom-
mended number of fifteen players. The girls had
players’ contracts to sign which entered their
names on the team roster—where they remained
until they were officially released by the manager.
After the first mass organization meeting in each
school, every team met separately to choose a
name, pick a captain, determine when and where
to practice, and work out any problems which
arose. The recreation department was on hand at
all times to assist the girls.

Besides the guidance given the girls in organiz-
ing properly, the department offered certain serv-
ices. In the way of physical equipment each team
was given two balls and two bats with which to
initiate practice sessions, and' throughout the sea-
son they were kept supplied on an exchange basis.
Catchers’ body protectors and masks were also
issued. Members furnished their own gloves, nec—
essary gear since they played with an eleven-
inch ball. They used this size ball because the
Belles team in Racine, a member of the All-
America Girls League, used the same size, and
their club provided our players with a felt emblem
to be worn on the girls’ playing uniforms, which,

RECREATION

in most cases, were a pair of blue jeans and a cot-
ton blouse. The recreation department further
furnished the girls with practice areas, coaching
assistance, and umpires.

When the groundwork was completed, we found
that the response was beyond expectation: from
each of the four junior high schools in town were
three teams of fifteen to twenty members who
had chosen such names as Powder Puffs, Teeners,
QT’s, and Starlets. A schedule was drawn up for
the Cadets to follow over a period of eleven weeks.
Naturally interest was at a high peak at the very
beginning; yet it only' took a couple of weeks of
rainy weather and postponed games to dampen
these youngsters’ spirits. As a result, we lost two
teams after they had forfeited two games each,
for this was one of the rifles of the league. With
ten teams with which to work, it was necessary to
restimulate and maintain interest.

Several techniques were used to do this: one
was to send a postcard to each girl every time her
team had a game to play. The local newspaper
also helped greatly by giving considerable space

to the activities of the league ; publicity in the form
of pictures and stories were excellent ways of
keeping the girls in the league. Another method
that really paid off was the contacting of the
Belles players—whom these junior high school
girls looked upon as heroines—to come out to spe-
cial practice sessions where they coached our girls
and gave them considerable help in improving
their game. All of these things proved very re—
warding for the league completed a fine season
of ball playing. Not only did the girls learn to play
the game according to the rules, but many other
values were realized. Friendships were formed
between the girls of the various schools, and all
in all, they had a great deal of fun during the
summer.

Perhaps other recreation departments have con-
templated organizing younger girls into softball
leagues but have not been quite sure whether it
would pay recreational dividends. We, in Racine,
feel that the experiment with the Cadet Girls’
League was a huge success and we are looking
forward to a bigger and better season this Year?

 

Let’s Go Out into the Garden and

' GROW WORMS

IN SPITE OF the many modern and artificial lures

for unsuspecting fish, the age old use of the
angleworm still satisfies the needs of many fisher—
men. In fact, so great are the demands for this
time-tried bait, that people everywhere ask “W here
can we get earthworms for jishing?” Some have
taken advantage of this situation and make a living
culturing worms for sale to the angler. These
commercial sources are not widely available and
cannot begin to meet the need; many people,
therefore, must resort to the spade and shovel in
order to go fishing. Some individuals, however,
are not so adept at finding the proper place to dig
—-or are in too much of a hurry to bother.

The earthworm is one of the easiest of all ani-
mals to raise. A few buckets or wooden boxes in
a shaded place in the backyard and a few minutes
of time each week will provide enough worms for
several fishermen. Earthwormsi multiply and grow
rapidly. Their only requirement is a damp, loamy
soil with plenty of humus for food. Why not
“grow your own”?

In Praise of Gardening

An Important Crop

Evelyn Craw Mathews

AST SPRING, WHEN we were buying seed for
L our garden, our son David, who has had his
own little plot for a couple of' years, surprised us
by saying, “One thing I really want to plant is
pumpkins.”

We had never thought of pumpkin vines as a
possible“ thing for a child to grow, but it was a
logical choice. He likes pumpkin pie as well as
any small boy and Jack-o-Lanterns have a great
fascination for him.

David planned that the next autumn he would
cut a smile in the face of a pumpkin he had grown
himself.

Gardening is fun for an adult who chooses it as
a hobby, but it is difficult to match the sheer en-
joyment of a six—year—old'as he picks out his seeds,
prepares the ground with a little assistance, plants,
waters and weeds his small plot. His carrots and
beets grew_ in rows which were slightly crooked,
but his pumpkin vines were, without doubt, his
prize crop. He watched the flowers open to the
sun and when the tiny green balls formed, he
brought two of his playmates to the garden just
to admire them. We rent a piece of fertile ground
from the municipality beside the city greenhouse
and David was very thrilled when the gardener,
who was employed there, complimented him on
his pumpkin vines—and, after all, as our son
pointed out, his job is to make things grow and
he should know!

By the time October arrived, the pumpkins
might have been -a little larger in size, (although
David never admitted this), but there were a lot
of them, and no one could deny that they were
without a mark or blemish. They were just the
right rich golden-orange color.

What a delicious taste those pumpkins had for
every member of the family when they appeared

MAY 1948

on the dining-room table either as a vegetable or
in a pie. We were agreed that never had pump-

kins tasted as good as those our boy had grown. .

The climax of the pumpkin growing came on
the last Saturday in October when David picked
out his five best pumpkins with great care and
brought them home in triumph. These best speci-
mens were to be used for Hallowe’en—one was for
David’s chum, Bobby; one for each of his two
sisters, Nancy and Rosemary; one for himself;
and the biggest one of all was set aside to be
taken to his second grade teacher. He did not
know of any other boy in his class who had grown

f‘ a pumpkin to decorate the school room on the

Hallowe’en party afternoon.

David has reserved the right to be our “official”
pumpkin grower again this year. If he gets half
as much “kick” out of his .garden next season as
he did last, it will be well worthwhile.

Cultivating any kind of a vegetable successfully
is a bit of an achievement for a grown-up, and it
gives a youngster a sense of real accomplishment.
Our vegetables cut down the family’s food expen-
diture, and in these days of rising costs that is
important.

As parents we covet for our youngsters the
happiness found in worthwhile activities. We want
our boy and girls to build strong bodies, to prac-
tice staying at a job demanding initiative and exer-
cise until it is completed. We know of no better
health investment for a family than the hobby of
gardening. It is also true that as we watched
David and his pumpkin vines, we realized that in
the sunshine and fresh air of our garden plot, the
most important crop which we are growing is not
pumpkins—nor any other type of vegetable—but
healthy, happy children!

DramatiesnThe Fun way i

1

Ruth Garber Ehlers

ANY DIFFERENT TASKS can be accomplished
M easily if done in the spirit of fun, and it is
altogether possible to have a wonderful time while
working toward certain objectives.

Perhaps you have a new group that hOpes to
become “The Little Theater Players” of your
community. If you have accepted the responsibil—
ity of helping them progress toward a well-work-
ing group, it will be ,necessary for you to employ
certain techniques and devices to help each mem-
ber feel, from the first meeting, that the group has
every chance of success.

Among the several ways a leader of such a
group may approach his different problems is
through usage of social recreation games that are
based on dramatic play. They not only help the
leader to know his group faster and help the mem-
bers to become acquainted, but their use is defi—
nitely an enjoyable way to develop the power of
expression.

The following games are suggested for the lead-
er who is looking for ways to encourage individual
and group participation:

1. Charades

Divide the large group into smaller groups.

Ask each .group to choose a word, work out a
way to pantomime it so that the others can guess
the word. Before the pantomime is given, a mem-
ber of the small group should tell whether it is a
proper or common noun, a verb, an adverb or an
adjective, and the number of syllables in the word.

The following are examples of good choices:

He-ro (All the men in the group stand in a
row.)

In-gra-ti-ate (A woman in a grey dress pretends
to eat.)

Won-der-ful (Group of people crowd into one
door frame.)

Mis-under-stand (A girl sits on the floor be—
neath a small table.) ‘ ‘ '

Post-age stamp (One‘stands still like a post.

70

Others walk past him and -say, “How old are
you?” and stamp foot.)

2. Real-life Dramatizations ‘

Have each group choose and develop a situa—
tion that most people have experienced.

Examples:

I. A girl and her family wait for her first date
to arrive. He finally comes and she introduces
him to the family.

2. One member demonstrates how to make
something, such as a boat, a hat, a toy.

3. Group chooses a story, casts the characters
and pantomimes the action.

3. Made-up Conversations

Ask the group members to divide into two’s.
Each couple decides upon two famous people and
proceeds to imitate them, converse with each other.
After they have finished the entire performance,
the others guess their identity.

4. Individual Pantomimes
Ask each one to imitate some person who is
known to all present. Encourage each to costume

in the fun way are valuable aids to learning.

their performance if possible.

5. Dramatic Problems

Give individuals or small groups dramatic prob-
lems to develop. Problems such as:

I. Pretend you are in a cafeteria. You choose
a substantial tray of food. When you reach the
cashier, discover you have no money. What would
you do?

2. Pretend you have just arrived on the corner
to meet your “date.” He doesn’t come. It gets

colder and colder. The wind is strong and cold. -

Finally in exasperation you decide to go home.
Just then he arrives. What would you do?

6. Creative Writing and Acting

Put the same properties indifferent boxes for
each group of three or four members. The prob-
lem is for each group to open a box, note the con-
tents, write a short sketch which includes the use
of all the properties, then give the sketch for.the
entire group. This can be a field day for your
imaginative members.

N UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY to learn about the
mysteries of the theatre at first hand is being
offered to New York high school students during
April and May. Broadway producers, directors,
actors and critics are cooperating in putting on a
series of lectures and demonstrations on theatre
techniques and problems for the express purpose
of acquainting high school students with the art
of the drama. The course"was announced recently
by an associate superintendent of the Board of
Education in New York City.

man’s hat.

b. A r0pe, a letter, a newspaper and a locket.

c. A check book, a handkerchief stained with

pation in dramatic games.

personality will explain and discuss some particu-
lar point of interest on the program which has
been devised to touch upon such important theatre
problems as costuming, acting, writing the play,
direction and theatre choreography. Some of the
stage people taking part are: Brock Pemberton,
producer of “Harvey” and “Janie”; Peggy Wood,

, star of “Old Acquaintance” and other plays; Lu-

cinda Ballard, costume designer for “Show Boat,”
“Annie Get Your Gun” and “Happy Birthday”;
Vernon Rice, drama critic of The N ew Y ark Post;
John O’Shaughnessy, director of “Command Deci-

- sion”; dancers of Theatre Dance, Incorporated.

This stage workshop has been arranged by the
coordinator of the School Art League and the re-
gional theatre director of the American National
Theatre and Academy. Admission is free to all
young members of the School Art League; but,
because the series is expected to arouse much in-
terest, it has been thought advisable to limit admis-
sions to eighteen students from each school.

In speaking of this venture, Helen Hayes, vice
president of the academy, says, “We are delighted
to work with -the School Art League and the New
York City Board of Education. We feel that a
knowledge of the standards and aesthetics of the
theatre should be a part of every student’s educa-
tion, and that it is our responsibility to help him
gain that knowledge.”

A State Park Day Camp Program

A blow-by—blow account of how South Carolina
has expanded its recreation program in parks.

P. R. Plumer

TATE PARKS ARE now coming of age in South
Carolina after thirteen years of acquisition,
development and operation. The state park sys-
tem is composed of eighteen state parks totalling
37,260 acres. There are six waysides totalling
159 acres, of which one is an historical area and
four others are in the process of acquisition, lease
and improvement. Three more parks are pro-
posed, and several recreation areas are under con-
sideration.

As the acquisition and development progressed,
one by one the parks became ready until the
summer of 1941 found fourteen in operation. The
year closing June 30, 1947 saw a record atten-
dance of 1,241,000.

Because this was such a new enterprise, those
of us responsible for the establishment of policies
of operation, and for setting up detailed aims and
objectives, have made it a practice to proceed with
caution. The first few years were devoted to such
problems as organization and administrative p01-
icies including purchasing methods, maintenance
standards, equipment, and many other details that
are most uninteresting, but so necessary, to lay the
foundation for an efficient and smoothly working
organization.

We have felt, from the very beginning, that our
state park system should go further than simply
furnishing beautiful areas with well-kept facilities
to be used by the public as it saw fit. We have
felt that the state parks should render a service
to the people in the form of interesting and in-
structive programs designed for both young and
old—programs which would induce pe0ple to use
the parks, which would show them how to do so
in the most beneficial way—programs to provide
recreational and educational opportunities for
everyone.

Proceeding along this line of attack, when it
was felt that the mechanical problems of park

74

operation had been reasonably well worked out,
we began expanding our park personnel to include

.people with recreation training and experience,

feeling our way by concentrating on one or two
parks to see what could be done. Every experi—.
ment was carefully studied and, after profiting by
the mistakes, we planned to expand the program
to most of the parks the next year.

The results of the program were immediately
recognized by a tremendous increase in park use.
In addition to the increase in the number of visi-
tors, there was an even greater increase in the
number of people who participated in the program
or. made use of park facilities. The number of
casual visitors who drove 'in and out of the parks
was rapidly decreasing. .

The only disappointing observation regarding
the first two years of this expanded recreation
program was the very small percentage of children
participating. We felt that there was a great need
for a program designed especially for school chil-
dren, a program which would combine opportu-
nities for educational improvement with whole-
some recreation through proper exercise and
plenty of fun. Such a program would not conflict
with, but supplement, the children’s regular edu-
cational program carried on during the other
months of the year. The morning hours in the
parks were not particularly busy and there would
be no confiict with other park activities. Park
lifeguards were already on duty and could care
for the safety of the children in the water and ,also
give instruction in swimming, water safety and
water sports. By increasing the park recreation
staff with leaders of varied training, a worthwhile

a program could be undertaken. The additional per-

sonnel, supplies and equipment would necessitate
a large expenditure for a relatively small income
but, because the enterprise was so worthwhile, it
was decided to try out a program in one park.

RECREATION

Such a program was initiated at Cheraw State
Park during the summer of 1940. Staff was en-
gaged, necessary materials and equipment pur-
chased, and a well-rounded program carefully
planned and put into effect. It soon became appar—
ent, however, that there were not enough children
participating to justify expenses. A careful analy—
sis brought out the fact that most of the children
had no way to reach the park. The only ones able
to come were those whose families had the time
and transportation facilities to bring them, and
even they did not come regularly. The Park Rec-
reation Director, an enterprising young man, then
went to one of the Service Clubs and asked them
to sponsor a free bus to the park five days a week.
After explaining what the park had to offer he had
no difficulty in persuading the club to sponsor a
bus, and from then on throngs of children began
toappear every morning. Later, two more buses
were added.

If this could be worked so successfully at
Cheraw, why wouldn’t it work in other state
parks? There was no doubt that the children
would participate if they had some means of trans-
portation at moderate or no cost. The State De-
partment of Education was advised of the prelim-
inary plans and their response was enthusiastic.
They felt that the children could obtain a very
important part of their education through our
plans—a part which the school systems, at that
time, were unable to give. They could not furnish
the necessary transportation, however, because

- . school buses were controlled by individual school

boards in each county, and many of them were con-
tracted from private individuals for nine school
months and were not available during the summer.
It was realized that the program in the parks
would be expensive—and no funds were available
for such expansion—but we decided to take a
chance. So with hopes and prayers that the in-
creased expense would be, at least in part, made
up by increased interest in the state parks and
resultant increased revenue, we began laying plans.
There remained only the problem of transporta-
tion. We set out to confer with all organizations
in the vicinity of every park _to find someone inter-
ested in sponsoring the transportation program.
It was explained to each group that the State
Park Service could not accept the responsibility
of transportation arrangements even though suffi—
cient funds might be provided for such purpose,
but we agreed to be responsible for each child from
the time he was unloaded from the bus until he
was put back on at the end of the program. We
suggested that some group “sponsor” the program

Transportation arrangements vary in different local-
ities. Above, children getting into school bus.

and assume the responsibility while accepting
funds from any interested persons or organiza-
tions. We suggested further that they adopt one
of three methods: (I) having the children pay all
expenses (which probably would average fifty
cents per week, depending on the distance to be
travelled); (2) having the children pay part of
the expense, the balance being supplied by sub-
scribed funds; (3) furnishing transportation free.

A bathhouse fee of twenty-five cents per child
was set, with each child having the option of buy-
ing a season ticket for one dollar. This fee was to
cover the use of the bathhouse, with no other
charges.

The bulk of the work of getting the program
underway was done very late in the spring, be-
cause of the fact that the Legislature did not pass
the appropriation bill until late ‘May. This was
probably the greatest drawback. of the entire pro—
gram, and there is no doubt that many more chil-
dren could have participated had it been possible
to begin laying plans early in the year.

By July first, day camp programs were in oper-
ation in twelve state parks, and the children were
being brought out by buses, the arrangements for
which were different in almost all cases. Not
knowing the best method of handling this, different
types of arrangements were tried.

In one instance, a mill supplied a bus for chil-
dren of neighboring villages. The children had
to pay fifty cents per week (twenty-five cents for
the bus and twenty-five cents for the bathhouse).
Other children were brought to the same park
from another town by a bus sponsored by the
Junior Chamber of Commerce for the same price.
Other children were brought out in automobiles
by their families.

,At some other park, the County Board of Edu—
cation supplied the buses, drivers, and all expenses
of operating, without charge to the children.

75

(Thus they had only to pay the bathhouse fee.)
At another, a Service Club sponsored the buses,
underwrote the expenses, and made a minimum
charge to the children. i

At only one park did the State Park Division
accept any responsibility for handling transporta—
tion arrangements. In this case the County School
Board donated six buses but refused to pay any
expenses or accept any responsibility. These buses
were accepted and funds obtained from the city to
be used for purchasing insurance and as a sinking
fund for expenses over and above those paid by
the children. In some instances, charitable organi—
zations not only furnished transportation but paid
the bathhouse fees as well.

During the summer 3,081 different children
spent 39,655 day camp days in twelve of the parks
or an average of slightly over thirteen days each.
They came from thirty—one different communities,
an average distance of eleven and one—half miles
from the park. The greatest distance traveled was
twenty-five miles.

Day camp programs were conducted for an

average of eight weeks during the summer—the,

shortest period being for three weeks—while two
parks conducted the program for a full twelve
weeks. The average size of the daily groups was
seventy-nine, with the largest average at one park
being 178 and the lowest twenty—two.

Thirty-eight different organizations and clubs
contributed $2,039.84 for transportation, and five
organizations contributed $217 to help pay bath-
house fees. The children themselves paid $772.10
in transportation fees and $1137.35 for use of the
bathhouses. Total cost of transportation and bath—
houses was $4,163.24 or slightly over ten cents
per child per day, with the child furnishing almost
half.

The total cost of putting on the program by the
state is estimated as $6,714.70. This figure was
obtained by prorating all expenditures in the
parks by items. The total bathhouse receipts of
$1354.35 can be credited to this amount, making
the net cost $5,360.35 or about thirteen and one—
half cents per child per day.

While this cost may seem rather large, it is far
below the cost to the state of putting a child
through one day in the public schools, and surely
there can be very few ways in which the money
could be better spent.

The activities comprising the day camp pro—
gram were divided into six main groups, for each
of which a trained and experienced recreation
leader was provided—except in the case of some
of the smaller parks where leaders, with training

76

in one or more of the activities handled, combined
portions of the program.

(1) Nature Study—one of the most important
of all the activities. A park naturalist was pro—
vided in all cases and there were 10,376 day
campers who participated. Activities included
hikes, lectures, nature craft, plant identification,
leaf printing, bird and animal study, insect and
reptile study, geology, nature games, study. of
beach and pond life.

(2) Cultural Activities—included drama, folk
dancing, singing pantomime, social dancing and
storytelling. In most cases, a leader’s full time
was given to this part of the day camp program.
A total of 12,881 day campers participated.

(3) Arts and Crafts—17,309 day camp days of
participation, and one of the most successful of
the programs. They included such activities as
basketry, bead work, weaving, block printing,
carving, modeling, knitting, leather work, painting,
drawing, photography, wood crafts, and many
others. About 10,000 useful and ornamental ob—
jects were made by the children and taken home.

(4) Social—20,783 day campers participated.
This included mostly quiet games, parties, picnics,
and entertainment. This part of the program was
usually conducted by members of the staff who
were principally engaged in other work.

(5) Aquatics—one of the most popular of all
the activities, with 30,191 day campers participa-
ting. Besides free swimming, this included instruc—
tion in swimming, life saving, diving, boating, and
water games. ,

(6) Land Sports—the most heavily engaged in
of the activities, having 37,425 participants. In—
cluded were archery, clock golf, tennis, and games
and sports of all kinds. _

Day campers were carefully checked off and on
buses. The buddy system was used throughout the
day, both in and out of the water, and proved very
successful. There were no cases of lost children
or any accidents other than minor ones.

The results of the first summer of operation
of the day camp program were very gratifying
and prove conclusively that it can be done. Many
improvements can be made. These things will be
carefully studied in an effort to work out all the
problems encountered. It is sincerely h0ped that
sufficient funds may be made available to carry on
the program next summer. After such a success-
ful start, and with the problems fresh in our minds,
it would be regrettable if it were allowed to drop.

A few conclusions from the study of the first
summer are given below for the benefit of those
who may be contemplating a. similar program.

RECREATION

 

Margaret Y. Wall,

Program Director.

(1) The State Park Department should not
accept responsibility for transportation. Also, for
the first few years at least, park officials will have
to do the promotion work but, if the program
offered is good and the people in the vicinity are
given enough time, they will———in most cases——
readily take the responsibility and there will be
plenty of children participating.

(2) The state should insist that all buses have
complete insurance covering injury to the children
enroute, and should recommend liability insurance
in all cases. Though only one small accident oc—
curred last summer, we only can consider our-
selves lucky because all buses were not properly
covered.

(3) Where funds are donated to help defray
transportation expenses (with children contrib—
uting part), it should be done in this manner: a
weekly transportation fee per child, sufficient to
defray expenses, should be set, and that fee
charged to all children whose families are willing
to pay. Transportation, or aid in transportation
for deserving children, designated by a welfare
agency or similar organization, should be fur—
nished free.

(4) Each child should have an identification
card, signed by parent or guardian, giving permis-
sion to attend. This card should be collected as
the child leaves the bus, and should be returned
as he re-enters the bus on leaving the play field.

(5) It is essential to have a well-trained staff
in charge of the day camp program which should
be kept interesting throughout. Care should be
taken to avoid any semblance to “classroom teach—
ing” and to offer activities in addition to sports
and swimming. Children should be allowed a rea-
sonable amount of choice of activities in which they
wish to participate.

(6) The success or failure of the whole ven-
ture rests almost entirely on the program. Trans-

portation will follow without much promotion if
there is reasonable proof that the children are
being given something that‘ is worthwhile; but if
the park program is neglected, all the promotion
in the world will be to no avail.

A day camp program can be closely allied with
the educational program of the state, and it is not
fantastic to visualize more cooperation from the
State Department of Education through provision
of transportation facilities. The school buses could
carry the children to the school for nine months
and to the nearest state park for three.

\Ve have only scratched the surface with this
program. It has tremendous possibilities. The
number of children who could be accommodated
could be expanded ten-fold, and over a period of
years we could reach every school child in the
state. With this program, combined with the adult
recreational and educational program which is
being carried on simultaneously, we feel that we
are approaching our goal of making the state park
system an institution rendering valuable service
to the people of its state.

The day camp program was suspended after
the 1941 season on account of the war. It was
revived during the summer of 1947 with some im-
portant changes.

A fee of two dollars per week was charged for
services rendered at the park. This fee was in
addition to expenses incurred for tranSportation,
thus putting the entire cost of the program on a
pay as you go basis. As was expected, enroll—
ments were lower, but a total of 2,558 camper days
was recorded in twelve different parks. A total
of slightly over $10,000 was expended on the pro-
gram by the State Park Division and $5,467.35

was collected in campers’ fees.

The program during 1947 was designed to put
more and more financial and leadership responsi—
bility back home in the local community. That the

77

 

demonstration was successful is indicated by the
fact that plans are being made by the local people
to conduct day camps, assuming all responsibility
for transportation and leadership in at least two
of the parks this year. '

The local sponsorship develops a healthy trend
because it will be a community project designed
to meet local needs for which the community will
pay the bill. It is a democratic venture because
only those communities recognizing the need and
showing willingness to cooperate will be involved.
There will be less imposed leadership from the
state. The Division of State Parks will reduce its

contribution to furnishing, free of charge, the use
of the area and facilities.

Because it has been demonstrated to be a feasi-
ble project from an economic and recreation stand-
point, more local communities should organize
and sponsor day camp programs. Life in the out-
of-doors has a dramatic appeal to all of our chil—
dren. They learn to swim, develop simple skills
with their hands and think in terms of cooperation
and democracy; and while becoming stronger in
mind, body and spirit, they become members of a
great army of youth who are resourceful, alert and
ready to serve their fellow men in the cause of
promoting a better world.

 

getter from @611 [as time

To THE NATIONAL RECREATION'ASSOCIATION:

I am afraid that with this letter I am the bearer
of bad news. I regret to inform you that Mr.
Baruch Ben-Yishai was killed on January 18th.
He was in “Maaleh Hachamishah,” a hill settle-
ment about twenty minutes drive from Jerusalem,
on the week-end January 16th to 18th in connec-
tion with defence duties he had undertaken. On
his return to work on Sunday morning he, to-
gether with a number of other people who were
in the truck in which he travelled, were shot at;
two people were killed outright. Mr. Ben-Yishai
was operated upon at once but he never regained

consciousness and died the same night. Because
of the danger on the roads, it was not possible to
bury him within twenty-four hours in accordance
with Jewish custom but he was buried on the Mt.
of Olives, together with other victims of that
week, on the following Thursday at dawn. Be-
cause of the conditions, neither his relatives nor
his friends were allowed to attend the funeral and
pay him their last respects.

His loss was a great shock to us. Baruch was
so full of life that it is difficult to think of him as
gone.

America into a secure country for them to

World at Play

Music Everywhere — May 2-9 marks the
twenty-fifth anniversary of Music Week. This
year’s theme is “Foster American Music”—the
same slogan that keynoted Music Week when it
was first recognized. The 1948 celebration seeks
to widen acquaintance with, and cultivate the love
of music among an ever increasing number of peo-
ple here in the United States and among the other
peoples of the world, in the belief that music offers
a bond of common interest and a medium of com-
munication which brings them a little closer to-
gether; and by_its very nature and the response
it evokes, generates friendliness. Executive direc-
tion and financial responsibility for the observance
of Music Week have been carried by the National
Recreation Association for the past five years.

year, as in the past few years, Old Glory will share
her honors with the fiags of other nations—those

In keeping with this spirit, every community
should call on its young and old to join in cere-l
monies and celebrations to commemorate this day.
The story of our country’s fiag should be a tradi-

fiags of all nations might be told through story,
pageant or other dramatic presentations. All pro—
grams should include the “Pledge of -Allegiance”

our country as well as to the red, white and blue.

12 5 tables flanking a small dance space in the
manner of a real night club. Decorations are blue
and white, and eight different sets of floodlights
are used to change color effects. Two huge multi-
pointed stars of mirror glass swirl in the ceiling,
sending their twinkling light over the floor. Sand-
wiches and soft drinks are served.

The basement has been outfitted for games and
sports, juke box music, and so on, and is open
daily from three-thirty to six and from seven to ten
p.m. Teen-agers between the ages of fourteen and
eighteen, who pay yearly dues of twenty-five cents,
are entitled to use the center. On Friday and Sat-

Is This the Solution?—It is interesting to
note that during the years 1943-1947, the period
which saw the development of more playgrounds
for Akron, Ohio, citizens, alsomarked a decrease
in the number of juvenile delinquency cases in that
city. In those four years, twenty-five playgrounds
grew to fifty-one; winter indoor recreation centers
from ten to twenty; summer playground atten-
dance increased from 300,474 to 400,836; total
yearly attendance from 570,000 to 1,398,781 ; and
the Juvenile Division of Summit County Common
Pleas Court, of which Akron is the county seat,
reported a reduction of more than 600 cases in
juvenile delinquency. In this same time, 114 peo-
ple enrolled for the recreation course at Akron
University and 208 leaders enrolled in four one-
week recreation leadership training courses taught
by National Recreation Association specialists.

Teen Center Trouble?

Symptoms (as observed in an actual- case):

Too much was given free at the beginning
without making the members earn, contribute or
do some work toward the equipment of the club.

Committees were changed every month, and
only one or two members on the committee would
work, with the result that no one,would serve on
committees toward the end. '

Cliques developed, and when one clique was
elected to office or committee, the other clique
members would not work with them.

Jealousy developed, and “some criticism was ex-
pressed by other agencies in the community who
wanted to do something for the youth.

Parents complained that attendance at the center
interfered with home chores and school work.

The main reason was “the center developed into
a monotony. Any activity which attempts to pour
through the same funnel the same members night
after night, meeting the same people, eating the
same sandwiches, drinking the same soft drinks,
playing the same games on the pool tables or other
table games, dancing with the same group, is
bound to become a monotony and prove a failure.”
Diagnosis—Anemia of program

Vitamin deficiency of youth responsibility, char-
acterized by a rash of petty jealousy.

Fluctuating temperatures of parents, caused by
poor scheduling of activities.

General debility on the part of the homes,
schools, social agencies and youth groups.

Prognosis—“Poor, unless drastic remedies are
taken.

Prescription—Complete physical examination of
program, schedule, facilities and leadership. On
basis of findings, apply following remedies as
needed:
I. Employ a leader for the teen center, either on
a full or part-time basis.
2. Set definite hours and notify parents so that
they will know when to expect youngsters
' home.
3. Failure in a school grade—uno teen center for
that teen—ager on school day nights.

MAY 1948

4. Bring all the criticisms and problems out into
the open. Hold a general meeting of the teen-
agers, representatives from the various agen-
cies and parents. Let the fur fly!

5. Appoint a committee at that meeting—of teen-
agers and townspeople—to analyze the situa-
tion and propose a plan for remedying it. That
plan might mean a complete reorganization.
In any case, it should be definite and drastic.

6. Don’t expect busy teen-agers to go very far
alone. They need enthusiastic guidance—but
it should be guidance. The real responsibility
should be theirs.

7. Cut down hours of teen center if youngsters
have too many extra-curricular activities.

8. Conduct an interest survey to find out what
the teen—agers would like in the way of pro-
gram. Organize smaller interest groups on the
basis of such findings.

9. Get volunteers to lead special activities such
as painting, drawing, jewelry-making, archery,
dancing, radio club, and so forth.

10. Plan special outdoor activities—bicycle hikes,
sunrise breakfasts, wiener roasts, beach par—
ties, hayrides, moonlight picnics, box suppers.

I I. Use all facilities available——-parks, playgrounds,
church recreation rooms, social agencies, as
well as teen center.

12. Start a little theater group, with the teen-agers
in charge of costuming, sets, make-up and di—
'recting, as well as acting. Use stunts and skits
first, then simple one-act plays. Produce them
finally for something—- veterans’ hOSpital,

church, PTA group, Red Cross.

I 3. Start a barbershop quartette among the boys;
a teen chorus; a teen band or orchestra. Use
them on community programs, picnics, dances.

I4. Start a junior garden club, classes in flower-
arrangement, a contest or flower show..

15. Plan a city-wide art exhibit—~on the sidewalk
of Main Street.

16. Don’t expect miracles. Self-government is not
easy to learn, nor to practice. Civic responsi-
bility is slow to germinate. Look at us adults!

At Headquarters . . .
George A. Nesbitt

 

MILING, CURLY-HAIRED George A. Nesbitt, of
S the National Recreation Association, has had
a varied career. For instance, few people who
know of his long and enthusiastic service in the
Association are aware of the fact that his college
degree from Ohio State University in 1912 was a
Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering. Al-
though no one would exactly refer to recreation as
a siren, George certainly listened to the siren’s
song when he was lured from his chosen path and
into recreation work these many years ago!

It might be said that it all started back in 1911
during his undergraduate days, when he wrote a
paper for a bible class banquet upon “The Value
of Church Playgrounds.” Just why he chose that
subject at that particular time he will never know;
but one thing led to another, as it always does. . . .

After leaving college he worked in the field of
chemistry for a time, but found, to his surprise, that
it was not the type of thing that he really wanted
as a life career. He tried other ventures, such as
advertising and selling; and meanwhile, interest-
ing letters began to come to him from Howard
Braucher of the Playground and Recreation Asso-
ciation of America. Such correspondence, over a
period of several years, eventually led George Nes-
bitt to the doors of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation where he signed a four-year contract. In
taking this drastic step he felt that he was signing
his life away, and perhaps he was—for he has been

MAY 1948

with the Association ever since.

When war started, April 6, 1917, the Play-
ground and Recreation Association mushroomed
almost immediately to take over the responsibilities
of War Camp Community Service, and George
was thrown headlong into its activities as it ex-
panded. His big job during the War Camp period
was as manager of the Assignment Bureau.

The bureau was promptly created to deal with
emergency problems and needs ; and so urgent was
this work that only a few weeks after Uncle Sam
claimed him for service to his country, he found
himself assigned back to his old job, but in Army
uniform.

At the end of the war, and following the merg—
ing of Community Service with the regular field
service department of the Association, Mr.
Braucher wrote him: “During the last twelve years
there have been few tasks for the Association
which have been carried through with more nearly
one hundred percent efficiency than your work in
the Assignment Bureau.” A valuable service had '
been performed; George Nesbitt had found his
niche. He was content.

He next joined the finance department, manag-
ing finance appeals from. Association headquarters.
Here he found satisfaction in doing a real promo-
tion job, keeping the Association’s relationship
with sponsors a happy one, keeping the finance
machinery running smoothly. This continued until
1933 when he began to receive field assignments
of a promotional nature. He spent about seven
months in the Southwest stimulating interest in
and support of the Association’s work. In the
East, various of his projects included that of check—
ing upon communities where Emergency Relief
Administration workers might be needed, and
bringing Association service to communities-that
had tried, without success, to have year-round
recreation programs.

During the second World War and resultant
shifting of professional personnel, the Association
called upon him to serve as district representative
in Michigan and Ohio. This assignment, though
temporary, turned out to be of nearly five years
duration; and not until late 1946 could he break
in another man and return to other duties requir-
ing someone with his special skills. ,

George Nesbitt’s service with the Association
also has included responsibility for a number of
studies, some of which were made primarily as
work tools for staff members. Among these were
a general study of county recreation and its possi-
bilities, a specific county recreation study in Anne
Arundel County, Maryland, a supplemental study

on' charges and fees in public recreation, and vari-
ous community recreation studies.

At headquarters, Mr. Nesbitt’s background of
varied experience frequently causes him to be
called upon to pinch-hit for other staff members
when they are away for an extended period. He
also represents the Association at important con-
ferences. Many recreation people have come to
know him through his registration activities at the
Congresses, as well as through his work in twenty—
eight states and in Canada.

It pleases him greatly to be stationed at Associa-
tion headquarters. Thus he is ableto live at home,
in upper Montclair, New Jersey, and to share
simple pleasures with his small, closely knit fam—
ily. He loves to putter around the house repairing
furniture and household equipment, working in the
garden, and improving things in general. Mrs.
Nesbitt" joins him in these projects. She, by

the way, is an accomplished musician, a graduate
of Oberlin Conservatory, and has taught piano for
many years. Son Bill and daughter Nancy are
gifted children. Bill, now a junior at Yale—who
was with the army on Okinawa—came forth with
an inspired bit of poetry during the early days of
the war. The poem, which was adapted for use in
Memorial Day exercises at the local high school,
appeared in the August 1942 issue of RECREATION.
Nancy, on the other hand, is now a senior in high
school, and has played the flute and piano in dif—
ferent orchestras at school affairs. She has spent
three summers as an assistant on the local play—
grounds, will be a playground director this sum—
mer, and will go on to Wellesley in the fall. Last
year she was girl tennis champion of 'the town.

One suspects that with this busy, satisfying life,
George Nesbitt has little call to turn his thoughts
back yearnineg to chemistry.

Texas, in 'an endeavor to set up a program where—

Several steps already have been taken towards

made listing the address of vacant lots and, by
checking with the proper authorities, the owners
of the lots were located. Permission for use of the
land was granted by all of the contacted owners,
with the understanding that they incur no ex-

for all of the equipment used—including the lum—
ber needed for the building of facilities; one vol—
leyball and net; one basketball and goal; two
horseshoe sets; one gallon of green paint and two
pounds of nails. A family living nearby will main—
tain the playground equipment (balls, horseshoes
and the like) and will issue it to the children after
school hours and on Saturdays and Sundays.

A sign four feet by six feet will be erected at the

front of each lot with the following information:

CITY RECREATION DEPARTMENT
“NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER”
Donated by
(Sponsor’s name)

Equipment may ‘be secured from
( M aintainer’s name)

and each center will be set up in identical fashion
so that sponsors will not complain of partiality and
children will not have to seek play lots outside of
their own neighborhood. Each, lot will have a vol—
leyball court, one basketball rack and goal, two
horseshoe courts, and a sand box where the
younger children can frolic without being endan—
gered by active older boys and girls. A sliding

. board, see—saw and swings may be added later by

the City Recreation Department.

AMERICAN Approved Equipment is constructed

exclusively of top quality'Steels, Certified Malle-

ables and finest, carefully seasoned Hardwoods,
all of which continue to be in critically short sup-
ply. Thus, although there are many short-cuts to
quicker deliveries, American Approved Equipment
just naturally can’t be built and shipped as
promptly today as in normal times, if we are to
maintain American’s rigid pre-war quality stand-
ards. You’ll benefit in the long run, however; for
superior American Approved Equipment will be
serving you well many years after inferior, sub-
stitute-built apparatus has had to be discarded.

A “Knot-Hole Gang”

Question—I have been placed as chairman of
the committee on boys’ and girls’ work for the
local Kiwanis Club, and our main project for
the coming year is the organization and the
carrying on of a Knot-Hole Club. Last year
we tried to carry on this project but did not
have much success, and we feel that this was
occasioned by the fact that we required regu-
lar- attendance at Sunday School as passes to
attending the ball games in the Knot-Hole
Club. We received some criticism and have
decided to eliminate this requirement this
summer.

May we have the benefit of your experience
along this line so that we may be better able
to carry on this project more efficiently?
Answer—The term “Knot-Hole Gang” is gen-
erally used to indicate a very loose organization of
boys under sixteen years of age who, in return for
certain promises of behavior, are provided with
tickets for baseball and football games or other
sports. These tickets are generally made avail-
able through the cooperation of public or social
agencies such as the public recreation department,
the YMCA, the Rotary Club, a local newspaper,
local baseball clubs, settlement houses, boys’ clubs,
and other organizations interested in boys’ wel-
fare. Usually the “Knot-Hole Gang” is widely
publicized through the newspaper, and member-
ship cards are distributed through such agencies
as mentioned above. These membership cards give
the name of the boy and the name of the agency
from which he received the card. On the back of
the membership card are listed agreements which
run as follows:

MAY 1948

 

Questions About—

I. I will not at any time skip school to attend a
game.

2. I will attend no game against the wishes of my
parents, principal or teacher.

3. I will uphold the principles of clean speech,
clean sports, and clean habits, and will stand
with the rest of the Gang against cigarettes and
profane language on the field.

4. I understand that the breaking of this agree-
ment will cost me my membership in the Knot-
Hole Gang.

The youngster carries this membership card
with a specific ticket to a game with him and when
he presents it at the gate he is seated in a special
section reserved for the Knot-Hole Gang. This
section is usually in charge of some representative
from one of the agencies. As a matter of fact,
frequently a member of one of the agencies ac-
companies each group of the boys attending the
game. Sometimes membership is limited to boys
twelve years of age or under, sometimes to sixteen
years and under.

In Newark, New Jersey, this program was
sponsored by the Newark International League
Baseball Club, the Boys’ Work Council, the civic
and service clubs, and the Recreation Department
of the Board of Education. In Cincinnati, the
Knot-Hole Gang is sponsored by the Cincinnati
Baseball Club with the cooperation of a great many
social public and private agencies interested in
boys’ welfare. In New Haven, Connecticut, mem-
bership is open to boys who are affiliated with
member agencies or institutions. When a boy has
become a member, he must make an application for
membership to the Knot-Hole Club through that
agency.

In other words, organization follows a very
simple pattern, and attempts to tie the youngster
up with some social agency.

Robert J. Dunham . . .

ROBERT J. DUNHAM died in Phoenix, Arizona,
on February 2, 1948, at the age of seventy-
one. A native of Chicago, where he became na-
tionally known as an eminently successful business
executive, he was best known in park and recrea-
tion circles through his association with the Chi-
cago Park District.

In 1934, when the people of Chicago voted to
consolidate the twenty-two independent park dis-
tricts of the city into a single park district, Mr.
Dunham was appointed president of the newly
formed Park Board. He held this post with
marked distinction and without remuneration for
twelve years. His administration of the Chicago
Park District was notably efficient. Most of the
separate districts he inherited were greatly in debt
' and a few were bankrupt. Gradually, under Mr.
i Dunham’s leadership, the entire park system was
: placed on such a sound business and economic

basis that it now serves as a model for other
, groups in the area.

His contribution to Chicago’s park service was
more than a contribution of business efficiency.
He had a deep sympathetic understanding of the
place of organized recreation in park work.

A reporter interviewing Mr. Dunham wanted to

. give special emphasis to the community value of .

the park system, bringing out eSpecially the fact
that its expenditures help create employment in
the city. Mr. Dunham convinced the reporter that
such monetary values were far less important than
the vital values of park work. He said: “I think
making Chicago a safer, healthier and friendlier
I place to live in is a much more important contri-
bution to Chicago’s business world than the money
we dispense either in payroll or in purchase of
I commodities. I think that what we contribute to
the morale of the people, to their courage, to their
confidence, to their pride in their community or
their city, is of much more benefit to trade and
r, manufacture. We are making Chicago a better
‘ place in which to live and raise a family. We are
making it a pleasanter place to visit, on vacation
as well as on business. We are adding to public
contentment and neighborliness. We are uniting
our people with new cross lines of acquaintance
‘ and friendship. We are broadening the general
cultural outlook, developing new interests on
which people can get together in friendly rela-
tionships. We are developing civic pride, and pro-
moting civic unity.” I

not be wholly dependent upon the film;
in which need for song will not depend
wholly upon the radio or gramophone,
and in which men and women will have
a going personal life that is central to
all their associated activities.”

--Lewis Mumford
