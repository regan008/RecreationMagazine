The Close Relationship

of Parks and Recreation . . . (211...... E. no.

No PARK was ever built that did not contain an element
of recreation in its concept.

No public recreation program was ever completely diver-
sified unless it utilized public parks.

Parks and recreation go together as completely as love
and marriage—“You can’t have one without the other.” In
point of fact, in public affairs parks and recreation are con-
sidered as a combined public service, for the public is not
well served by facilities alone or by program alone. It is
the combination of both, in a single unified service, that
constitutes the commodity which interests the public.

When two separate municipal departments, the park de-
partment and the recreation department, apparently func-
tion well together—because the component parts have been
well coordinated and the personalities involved are com-
patible—it is often said that one provides the facilities, the
other conducts the pr0gram. This is not quite the case be-
cause, depending on the situation, either the park depart-
ment or the recreation department may be providing and
conducting the various services. These may be golf courses,
tennis courts at unsupervised locations, boat docks and boat
livery service, picnic areas (both organized and unorgan-
ized), nature trails, summer musical entertainment, and
others. Actually, in the successful Operation of parks and
recreation as separate departments, the whole field of park
and recreation service must be under continual examina-
tion, and allocation of functions must be made to each of the
departments on a more or less logical, but nonetheless arbi-
trary, basis. In no other way can the combined service be
made complete or can duplication of effort be avoided.

Park departments and recreation departments, along with
their respective ideological camps, are much like married
couples—they can quarrel with each other but let the in-
tervener or common enemy beware! Assuming basic com-
patibility between them, husband and wife can turn on an
enemy with greater combined force and effort than a mere
two times one. 50 must it be with park and recreation forces.
With municipal redevelOpment programs and freeway dis-
ruptions now in the oiling, they must combine talents to avoid
serious setbacks to municipal park-recreation services. Just
a few of the, present common dangers can be cited.

RedevelOpment authorities are prone to plan all facilities
for the area, proposed to be redeve10ped, as though that
area were a complete planning unit for all services. It could
be a logical neighborhood for park and recreation service,
or only a part of a single neighborhood. Who can properly

MR. DOELL, well-known in park and recreation circles, is
superintendent of parks in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

provide the true picture of the appr0priate total park-recr
ation service? The park man? The recreation man? On]
the combination of the two, or the department in which bot
are combined, can logically reflect thc nature and extent 3
the combined park and recreation service required in thi
instance, as a part of the over-all plan of service to th
entire city. If the matter is important enough to carry th
argument to Washington, only an agency in which the phi
los0phy of both parks and recreation has been developed an n
refined by repeated experiences is strong enough and con
vincing enough to carry the day. No divided authority fo
parks and recreation will “cut the mustard” here.

If the strength of a united front for parks and recreatio
is needed in redevelOpment projects, the need is even greate
to combat the aggressive and often ruthless attack by high
way planners. Only recently has the value of integrate
neighborhoods as a unit of municipal life been appreciated
Much still has to be done to place tangible values on ope
spaces and recreation areas. Parks are more than attractiv
vacant areas. They are the tools of a recreation service, th
extent of which is seldom known to material planners an nl
the psychological effect of which, on a metropolitan society
appears to be too intangible for them to take seriously int
consideration. Much educational work must be done and
again, hope lies only in the combination of a parks and rec
reation philos0phy.

Towns and cities suburban to a central city in metropoli
tan areas have grown at an amazing rate in the last decade
The consequent demand for park and recreation leader
has frequently been filled by employing one individual whu.
is trained, usually, in only one phase of park and recrea
tion work or, even more often, as a recreation leader. Wit
facilities meager and funds limited, the job of providing bot
park and recreation programs has suddenly been thrust upo
young men and women almost fresh out of school. They hav
been called upon to plan services for a town belonging to
larger metr0politan area, where the government organiza
tion is daily becoming more complicated. Actually thes
young people are being placed in a very tough spot. Error
of judgment in philosophy are almost unavoidable.

These few examples illustrate the closeness of the associa
tion between two services that have frequently been con
sidered as two separate functions of government. The fac
that the maintenance of parks and the operation of recrea
tion programs are specialties within the single framewor
of a single service is accepted by the general public. Pro
fessionals, too, must accept this doctrine if a public park
recreation service is to discharge adequately its responsibil
ities and fulfill rthe destined niche its worth prescribes. I

Public Relations
Sirs:

Richard Baker’s article “Public Re-
lations in Recreation” in the October
RECREATION was most enlightening.
This article might go a long way to-
wards waking up many a recreation di-
rector who has fallen asleep at the
wheel. I feel, along with Mr. Baker, that
it takes a great deal of love and self-
sacrifice to promote good recreation in
your city or community. Too many are
content to sit back and complain about
all the inadequacies of our profession
and do nothing to better them.

Hats off to Richard Baker and his
very illuminating story!

perintendent, Recreation Division.

Inspiring Address
Sirs:

We were pleased to read the editorial
by Dr. Paul F. Douglass in the Novem-
ber issue of RECREATION. The editorial
is only a small portion of the inspiring
address he gave at our annual L. H.
Weir Recreation Banquet.

When Dr. Douglass gave his address
at our 2,300-acre Bradford Woods Out-
door Recreation Area we were fortunate
in having as our guests Indiana Uni-
versity President Herman B. Wells,
chairman of the National Council on
Education and a UN delegate; Judge
John Hastings, chairman of the Uni-
versilv’s board of trustees; other oili-
cials of the University. professors, alum-
ni, and students. Everyone was thrilled
by the dynamic address of Dr. Douglass.
Recently President Wells quoted Dr.
Douglass in an all-University program.

The L. H. Weir Banquet is conducted
by the Indiana University Graduate
Recreation Society with the assistance
of the Undergraduate Recreation So-
ciety.

Letter to Dr. McCarthy
Sir:

I want to congratulate you on your
splendid editorial in the September is-
sue of RECREATION. Your philosophy
of human fitness included the mental,
emotional, spiritual, as well as physical,
which comes at an important time when
some of our colleagues tend to see the
individual only as muscle.

I am certain professionals in the rec-
reation field heartily support your phi-
los0phy of total or human fitness and
would hope that emphasis be given to
this totality of the human personality
rather than just the physical. I ex-
pressed this concept in the July issue of
the YMCA Journal of Physical Educa-
tion in an article entitled “Physical Fit-
ness or Total Fitness.”

Best wishes to you in your efforts.
HARRY D. EDGREN, Professor of Rec-
reation Leadership, Purdue U ni-
versity, Lafayette, Indiana.

November Issue Scores
Sirs:

The November 1957 issue of your
magazine has forced me to speak out. 1
must confess that during this past year
the content of the publication had failed
to arouse any interest— and then the
November magazine hit with full im-
pacL

The articles, “Know Your Adoles-
cents” and “Recreation in the Age of

Enjoyment,” highlighted a wealth of
fine information, progressive thought,
and stimulating philosophy. My files are
loaded with reference material and I
seldom retain any RECREATION maga-
zines, but November forced me to mount
many pages on our bulletin boards at
schooL

The recreation department here at
Los Angeles State College is eagerly
awaiting your next issue.

Letter from Paris
Sirs:

Milwaukee’s newest addition, the
Memorial Center,* seems to be a suc-
cess, if the November 4 Time magazine
article, “Museum with a View,” is a
true indication. Milwaukee residents
are to be congratulated, and the leaders
of this project are to be commended for
a job well done. The community will be
rewarded for its pains. Churches. edu-
cation, industries, recreation, and even
the “Braves,” will reap the fruits of
this venture.

Endeavors such as this are big busi-
ness. Cities need more of it, particu-
larly in the areas of art, music, and mu-
seums. Well-planned projects induce
prOper execution and mean money well
spent

Editorially Speaking

For the Year Ahead
At the end of the old year and the

beginning of the new, one becomes in-
trospective, sorting out some of the
past year’s happier or more inSpiring
moments and turning to' anticipation
of what lies ahead. Let us take advan-
tage of this inevitable moment of eval-
uation . . . What did the year hold
that was memorable for you? For the
job you have undertaken?

Life is made up of tomorrows—and
past experiences can be the basis of
successes in the days to come. What
the year ahead may hold can to some
extent be molded by building on past
failures as well as on achievements and
present needs.

Examine the articles in this issue of
RECREATION in the light of the old year
and the new leaves to be turned in
1958. Consider the ideas in their titles,
for instance, such as: “Your Office-—
Its Importance to Your Job”; “Plan
That New Art and Craft Room”; “A
Citizens’ Theater—By and For the
People”; “The Superintendent’s Code
of Principles”; and others.

Tonzorrow’s world will demand citi-

It must be found in personal and ma-

may know other peoples, and they may
know us.—— Pearl S. Buck.

Brotherhood

“An international, intcrcultural pro-
gram in American camps or other
youth programs is a healthy one in the
broadest scnse,” writes Dr. Ralph J.
Bunche. Under-Secretary of the United
Nations, “educationally and spiritually
as well as physically. Expericnce of
this kind makes a vital contrihution to
firm foundations for democracy, broth-
lerhood. and peace in the world.”

No Stopping

As we cruise along into 1958, in
what has become an age of speed, the
following warning comments from a
recent issue of Notes“ are very apt:

“Spinning along the New York State
Thruway, one occasionally notices this

 

, N o s T o P P I N G
Slgn— EXCEPT FOR REPAIRS and

may become bemused, as the Words
hum their way into the mind and lodge
in the memory. The analogy between
the huzzing Thruway and the hectic
highway of our own lives deepens and
grows all too vivid until those words

seem—

 

EXCEPT FOR REPAIRS

almost ghoulishly—to be the haunting
characterization of our twentieth een-
tury. We seem to be part of a great
migration, headed somewhere, under
way, under a goad, hurried and har-
ried, ‘committed,’ and responsible—
No stopping except for repairs.”

To think of a vacation as a repair
job may not be particularly appealing,
hut it has both practical and amusing
features; and it may waken us to cer-
tain discoveries. Perhaps we would
gain if we stopped this everlasting
scuttling about and took a longer, freer
stride. Perhaps “repairs” should be a
daily rather than an annual process——
the old “stitch in time” or “ounce of
prevention” that was once in favor.
Perhaps maintenance is a word that
should be revived, although, as has
been said, “There’s no publicity in

New York Public Library.

maintenanee.” And perhaps Socrates
was right, and “the unexamined life is
not worth living.”

Can Sports Promote Peace?

The Sports Committee of President
Eisenhower’s PeOple-to-People Pro-
gram is making a search for an answer
to this question. How, for instance,
ean a discus thrower make a pitch for
peace?

The committee reports that, aecord-
ing to the figures in Communist record
books, the Iron Curtain countries are
outplaying us in the field of interna-
tional sports exchanges fifteen to one.
However, the other side of the coin
sees the light of day in a recent article
in the Archers’ Magazine,** “Ameri-
cans in Prague Win Medals, Hands
and Hearts,” which tells the story of
our American archery team eompeting
in the 18th World Championship in
Czechoslovakia. It states, “We won the
tournament and we won hundreds of
new friends. We worked harder at
making friends than we did at shooting
and are not sorry.”

President Eisenhower, in keynoting
a White House conferenee of leading
who had assembled to
tackle this problem of creating a better
understanding between Americans and
people abroad, presented the matter in
these words:

Amerieans

“If we are going to take advantage
of the assumption that all people want
peace, then the problem is for people
to get together and to leap governments
——if necessary to evade governments—
to work out not one but thousands of
methods by which people can gradually

learn a little bit more of each other.”

A People-to-People Sports Com-
mittee was considered a natural, along
with various other methods. Eddie
Eagan, a Well-known sports figure since
the days when he won the Olympic
heavyweight boxing championship,
was appointcd chairman. He says:
“Let us elevate sports to the status of
ambassador. Lct’s take a fresh look at
man’s urge. to play and recognize it for
what it is—a living force of tremen-
dous potential in the development of
friendship and understanding among
peoples.” l

Your Office . . .

Its Importance to Your job

A New Leaf for the New Year

RECENT VISITS to the offices of sev-

eral social agencies, businesses,
and professions have provoked this
article.

It seems that professions dealing
with those services that make life
brighter for people are very likely to
he housed in offices that give little or
no indication of the warmth; the in-
terest, the objectives or the results of
those services, or of the personalities of
the people working in them.

On the other hand, the offices of
lawyers almost always give the feeling
of stability and security. The chairs
are large and comfortable, the tables
sturdy, the colors dark hut rich. Doc-
tors’ offices give an atmosphere of re-
assurance. There are piles of current
magazines, chairs are soft, reading
lamps and ashtrays handy. Often one
corner of the room has child-size furni-
ture and toys for the younger visitors.
The offices of the business firms are
again a contrast. with the furniture
modern, colors brighter and gayer.

Whether modern or conservative,
these offices have two qualities in com-
mon: the visitor is welcomed; his com-
fort is important. These offices are,
in other words, objective.

In contrast, the offices of some social
agencies are subjective. They show a
preoccupation with their own inner
workings. They do not project. A visi-
tor feels almost an intruder. No special
provision has been made for his com-
fort. Often the furniture is old and
not very comfortable. Walls are dark,
lighting poor. Nothing indicates that
the services of the agency are impor-
tant. Do the offices of recreation de-

gram Service.

partments fall into this category?

If so, what are the reasons for this?
An ohvious one may be the budget, al-
though “maintenance” usually gets a
pretty fair slice of available funds.
Swimming pools must be filtered and
cleaned, tennis courts freshly lined,
park lawns mowed, playground equip-
ment repaired, and so on. Such main-
tenance is primarily to please the puh-
lic. Why isn’t an attractive, pleasing

office just as important? Why can't
a maintenance crew refinish furniture

and old filing cabinets, paint walls, lay
an inexpensive, easy-to-clean floor,
build a display cabinet, and a good-
looking bulletin board? Even in a one-
man department, nobody should have
to step over half-inflated volley balls,
or look at a yellowed photograph of
years back, or brush dust off a chair
before using it. '

Another reason for drab recreation
offices may be the fact that they are
frequently located in the municipal
building or another city building,
among other civic departments. There
are two considerations here. The first
one is what every woman knows———that
making a room attractive takes more
thought than money. The second con-
sideration is easy—does the office have
to be in this place? If there’s a new
heautiful center‘just huilt or in process
of being built, why couldn’t the office
be moved into it? This has been done
in Seattle, Washington; Lincoln, Ne-
braska; Indianapolis, Indiana; Greens-
boro, North Carolina; and in other
cities, too.

If this is possible, then plan that
office space! When your recreation
board meets, will the setting emphasize
its importance? When a mother comes
in to ask about planning a hirthday

Virginia Musselman

party, a teacher to ask about simple
craft projects, a committee to talk
ahout getting a new playground—
where can you or your staff give the
best service and make the best impres-
sion? When craft leaders or dance in-
structors want to experiment with new
media or new' music, where can they
do it without disrupting the clerical
staff? Where can you concentrate on
your annual report or the talk you’re
giving before the Rotary Club? Plan
the recreation office for service.

Possibly another reason for unattrac-
tive offices is the old idea that beauty
means frivolity. Those days are gone
forever! Observe what’s happened to
the kitchen and bathroom of yester-
day! Look at the winged fenders and
the ice cream colors of the modern
cars. Look at telephones, fountain
pens, typewriters———once all a uniform
black, now in every color of the rain-
how.

The chief reason for the inertia in
making recreation offices attractive is
a simple one——habit. We got used to
tans and browns, old filing cabinets,
desks with rough edges, chairs that
have seen better days, windows that
need washing. We don’t look at them
with a fresh. comparative eye, as a new
board member will, or a reporter, or
any other “outsider.”

Yet we deal with the most exciting
of all commodities—people. \Ve pro-
vide the most attractive products———lei-
sure-time activities. Manufacturers of
everything from cigarettes to motor-
boats fill their ads and their TV com-
mercials with recreation activities——
square dancing, baseball. fishing, ski-
ing, swimming—yet how many recrea-
tion offices have pictures or photo-
graphs that show their own activity

programs? Department stores and
manufacturers set up seasonal displays
of china, jewelry, table mats—but how
many recreation department offices do
the same with the products of their
arts and crafts classes? (A hobby show
once a year is not a substitute.)
Sporting goods stores know the dec-
orative value of sports equipment, but
how many departments use baseball
hats, gloves and masks, or other inter-
esting equipment in season to sym-
bolize their sports program? Theater
marquees show photographs of drama-
tic scenes to publicize their plays—hut
do recreation departments?

What Can Be Done?

First of all, change your point of
view. Look at the office as though you
had never seen it before. Ask your
taff—and your wife—to do the same.
Discuss it. Do a little brainstorming
to get ideas. Think of the office as the
hcart of the department, the one place
where anyone can get a bird’s-eye view
of your city-wide program.

Don’t be afraid of color. Think how
important a place color has in our
thoughts and in our language. We are
“tickled pink” when we’re pleased; we
“see red” when we’re angry; we “feel
blue” when we’re depressed. These ex-
)ressions are based on the effects that

colors have on us, both physiologically
and psychologically.

With all the new, inexpensive and

10 excuse for drah, colorless walls.
ooms that are bright with sun can bc
)ainted a cool, soft, restful color.
ooms that are dark can be made to
.ome alive with a sunny, warm color.
If you’re cursed with old, shabby
wooden desks, filing cabinets, chairs
nd tables, you have two choices. You
an sandpaper them down to the natu-
ral wood, then give them a filler coat,

lac and paint them to match the walls

Filing cabinets, whether wood or
metal, are indiSpensahle—but unattrac-
tive. Metal ones, usually tan, green or
grey, stick out like sore thumbs where-
ever they are. They can be recessed,
however, by building shelves on each
side—for displays of arts and crafts,
puppets, sports equipment and/or for
your recreation library. ’

Pictures? There are many possibili-
ties. For large wall areas what could
be hetter than photomurals?* If you
like photos of people better than of
places, blow up some good action shots,
a picture of a playground full of young-
sters, a child working hard at a craft
project, and so on. Scenic views make
beautiful murals, too—a park, a beach,
a golf course, the winter scenes.

If the wall'area is large and the
pictures fairly small they’ll be lost un-
less you group them. Contrasts are in-
teresting: the very first playground
and the very latest, the first recreation

building and the latest, with descrip- ‘

tion and date under each.

If you’re not afraid of color, there’s
nothing gayer than children’s paint-
ings. Use fairly large white mats for
them, and frame them with simple, na-
tural wood. You’ll be surprised at
what conversation pieces they will be-
come. There are also the incxpensive
prints of famous artists that have a
recreation flavor—Degas and his ballet
children, Brueghel and his street festi-
val scenes, children’s portraits by
Manet or Van Gogh—any museum or
store that sells prints will offer you a
wide choice. With all the painters in
the art classes in your town, however,
why should you have to go far afield?
Borrow them! It’s good promotion, and
you’ll have frequent changes.

Your office should have a magazine
rack, too, on which you keep the latest
issues of REcREA'rION (naturallyl),
Parents’ magazine, Junior Arts, and
any others that you find helpful.

A large, fresh map of the park and
recreation areas in your community,
pr0perly marked with colored pins, is
not only decorative, hut will give you
a chance to “educate” your visitors.
But to keep it up to date! A stale map
is like yesterday’s neWSpaper.

Little touches can be very egective.
A bowl of flowers, a healthy growing
plant will give some life to the office.
Don’t underestimate simple desk acces-
sories, like blotters, for example. Look
at the one on your desk right now. Is
it fresh and clean, or is it nondescript
in color, with the edges of the desk pad
stuffed with notes?

Take down the wall calendars, and
use a desk one instead. Take down that
postcard from Florida that somebody
sent you years ago, that cartoon that
was funny at the time but is now curl~
ing with age. Don’t put anything on the
walls unless it adds to the general at-
tractiveness of the office.

A bulletin board will provide a place
for schedules, special notices, cartoons.
Use cork or pegboard and water-soluble
paint to make it any color you wish,
and change the colors once in a while.
Decorate occasionally with a seasonal
or topical theme.

N o matter what color scheme you use,
or what decorations, the office should
be neat and clean. Typewriters should
be covered when not in use. Coats and
hats should be hung up or put in lock-
ers. Desks should be cleared at night.

If you are proud of your department
and its work, your office should reflect
that pride. Any visitors, as well as
your staff and yourself, should sense in
your office the true values of a rich and
varied program for all ages, and should
feel, as a result, a confidence that thc
department gives effective service. I

Research in Action

E. H. Thacker-

Is your recreation department actively engaged in re-

search? Mr. Thacker presents some of the know-how.

BEFORE BEING accused of impersonating a researcher, per-
haps I had better explain what the District of Columbia
Recreation Department considers its definition of research.
Mr. Webster says research is “critical and exhaustive in-
vestigation or eXperimentation, having for its aim the dis-
covery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the re-
vision of accepted conclusions in the light of these newly
discovered facts or the practical application of these facts
and conclusions.” As an operating agency we take a slightly
modified View of it. We emphasize the practical approach,
using our brand of research as a means of solution to a
current problem. We are not convinced that a research
worker would consider our methods as “critical and ex-
haustive.” Instead, we might substitute “objective, impar-
tial, and analytical.”

We seek immediate and applicable answers to operating
problems. We try to look objectively at present methods,
procedures, and operations. We expect the researcher to
make an impartial study and draw conclusions from the
facts obtained. We insist on an analytical approach where
all factors are compared and evaluated before recommen-
dations are made. Within this broader and more general
definition of research the District of Columbia Recreation
Department conducts a variety of studies. The department
employs a recreation analyst who devotes most of his time
to these studies.

Types of Problems

Our studies embrace many topics ranging from whether
a particular playground should have a tennis practice board
to the fees paid softball umpires to a comprehensive review
of the public recreation system. They are concerned with
problems of policy, administration, organization, and pro-
gram. Studies under way or completed include:

1. Night-lighted ball fields—need for, use of, cost of,

power costs paid by? And other such questions.

2. Sunday use of school buildings and grounds—hours,
activities permitted, control.

3. Community use of school buildings—by profit and
nonprofit groups, fees for use.

4. Maintenance practices—their adequacy, economy, ef-
ficiency.

5. Position assignments—desirable personnel strength
per unit, safety and control factors, program needs, de-
ficiencies.

6. Neighborhood studies—need for playground, facilities
needed, activity preferences, participation by age and sex,
and so on.

7. Evaluation of existing areas—-—cost analysis, attend- '
ance, cost per participant.

Methods and Procedures

The District of Columbia Recreation Department con-
ducts much of its work through committees. There are sev-
eral standing committees, and ad hoc committees are formed
as needed. Some of the broader studies are conducted by
the latter. These are staff committees, board committees, or
a combination of both. Occasionally there are interagency
committees with representatives from the public schools,
the parks office, or the planning commission, joining in a
study of mutual problems. In every instance the recreation
analyst is responsible for conducting or guiding the re-
search part of the committee’s work; other studies are his
sole responsibility. He determines the scope of the study,
outlines methods and procedures, assembles the data, draws
conclusions, and makes recommendations.

One or a combination of several methods is used.
Neighborhood surveys are used if the problem concerns a
particular playground or neighborhood. Some studies re-,
quire a gathering of statistics. We use questionnaires oc-
casionally, sent to comparable cities across the country. We.
choose cities, that to our knowledge, have similar problems
or may have already solved such a problem. The question-
naires may be quite detailed, as in our maintenance study,

RECREATION

r they may be a “quickie” type. These,_comprise two, three,
- r four questions requiring “yes” of “no” answers on a
‘ ouble postcard. We send these to selected cities to fill us
I on a particular policy or practice. We have had a good

_ ' rcentage of returns from this type.
| Occasionally our research needs only a summation of
' istoric data. This may be acquired from the files and
ecords of our own department and the minutes of board
etings, or through a search of books, periodicals, and
her published sources. The compilation of historic data
ives us the opportunity of observing trends, re-evaluating
i ‘ r operations, and, changing or reaflirming our policies.
j Our neighborhood surveys are sometimes intricate
iough to require door-to-door canvass “of each home.
". _ ashington’s population is always in a state of flux. We
I ed to know whom we are serving, whether we have a dif-
i rcnt age group than formerly, whether our neighborhood

|
| -. changing over to boarding houses, apartments, or com-

rcial establishments. Sometimes we sample attitudes of

sidents to a change of program or new facilities. In one
its. nstance we made such canvass prior to erecting a tennis

. actice board, to determine possible objection to noise or
1nd .4 rly morning use.

: As much as we like neighborhood studies and the house-
ef- o-house method of obtaining facts, we realize they entail a

|rtain amount of risk. Interviewers must be very carefully

ained or they may cause more harm than good. What

ight have been effective public relations can, through mis-
on, Ianagement, cause irreparable harm to the recreation de-
,6, rtment.
,._, We do not always need to make a house-to-house canvass,
by owever. Frequently we can get the information we need
'0} rom other sources. Our own recreation leaders have an
,3, xcellent store of information about the neighborhood in
0k; hich they work. Civic groups and PTA’s help, as do
,3 I llurches and private youth-serving agencies. Census reports
ion lso help, although in a city like Washington we must re-
re. ember that conditions change rapidly and 1950 census
hi, tatistics are likely to be outdated. However, our local gov-
Id}, rnment, by pooling data from various sources, estimates
3,, nnual population changes with reasonable accuracy.

The compilation of all data is pointless unless it is care-
55¢ ully studied and evaluated. The committee, or individual,
,5, iaking the study analyzcs it to determine whether it is
re. alid, reliable, and pertinent. In drawing conclusions we
Dc. ust compare it to some sort of standard. In some in-
we tances we can find an accepted national standard applica-
,, )le to our study. This might be as elementary as the desir-
ion. ble standard of one acre of playground for each eight hun-

ldv, '. rcd population, or we might compare our expenditures with

my ANUARY 1958

the desirable six dollars per capita for parks and recreation.

When we cannot find a generally accepted standard, we
must establish our own. We might contrast our practices
with those of other comparable cities, as determined by our
questionnaires and surveys. If the data we have can be ana-
lyzed statistically, we do so and use the mean as a meas-
ure of standard. We have also used standard deviations and
coefficients of correlation in our statistical analyses. From
a statistical treatment we have determined the average cost
per participant for each of our playgrounds. Also, we know
the maintenance cost per acre and per participant; the aver-
age leadership load in programing; the number of leader
and custodial hours spent at each unit; the cost of supplies
and utilities, and so on. Further statistical analysis permits
us to spot immediately units where one or more of these
costs are excessive or extremely low. Then by subjective
analysis we can draw conclusions and prepare recommenda-
tions for further action.

In drawing conclusions and preparing recommendations,
we. must always remember that we are dealing with people.

‘.

Thus cost alone is not a consideration in curtailing services.
We must contrast cost against local recreation needs. After
all, a basic purpose of public recreation is to provide services
and facilities with which the public cannot normally supply
itself. Therefore, we must sometimes continue programs or
services, seemingly excessive in cost and personnel time ex-
pended. These are the subjective factors, completely con-
tr_adicting statistical and other factual information, which
influence our conclusions and recommendations. The value
of objective information obtained from a study lies in find-
ing easier or more eliicient ways of administering a program.

Advantages of Research

Certainly there are other approaches to research at the
operating level. Other cities and other individuals may
organize their program differently. Other methods and pro-
cedures can produce as good, if not better, results. We
have outlined how one city has combined research with its
program operations. It has paid off for us. Our correspond-
ence with other cities has kept us informed of their current
trends and solution of mutual problems.

Some of our studies have enabled us to gather pertinent
facts from many sources and assemble them in logical and
permanent form. These reports justify our existence and
our purposes. The frequent use of statistics has illustrated
the value of an orderly and consistent collection of numeri-
cal facts about our operations from year to year.

We have found that neighborhood studies can be most
helpful as a public relations tool. A door-to-door canvass
is an excellent means of spreading program information,

13

and it can be a means of exposing even more people to com-
munity recreation. Drawing citizen groups into studies has
another advantage. It helps them feel that they are part of
the recreation department, that their thoughts and attitudes
are important, and that they have a voice in affairs of gov-
ernment. This is important in an otherwise voteless city.

From the standpoint of the executive, conclusions reached
by research enable him to present recommendations with a
marked degree of confidence. It removes hesitancy and
doubt, and places him in a strong position in dealing with
his board. A feeling of authority and security is reflected in
his presentation.

Limitations

We face limitations and disadvantages, too, in conducting
our studies. It is impossible to obtain complete informa-
tion through correSpondence. A questionnaire brief enough
to elicit a reply limits the breadth and depth of the infor-
mation obtained. If questionnaires are too long and de-
tailed they are never returned. We occasionally find that
replies to our questionnaires are superficial, hastily an-
swered, inaccurate and perhaps contradictory. When this
happens, it indicates that we have failed. We probably have
not described the problem in terms easily understood hy
the recipient or have not identified a mutual problem. We
know, however, that we are dealing with the human ele-
ment here, and there are hectic days in every recreation
executive’s life when nothing would provoke an understand-
ing response. We have those kinds of days ourselves.

There is a danger, too, in relying too heavily on statistics
to document our conclusions and recommendations. What-
ever statistics are used should be valid and reliahle enough
to eliminate the personal bias of the researcher. The statisti-
cal concepts must he well founded and applicable to the
problem under study; and cold, hard figures do not con-
sider the human factor.

Lessons Learned

To help us in the future, we try to rememher the follow- _

ing points.
In questionnaires:

1. Keep them short.
2. Study and phrase each item carefully to make sure it

is clear, understandable, and able to elicit the information

desired.
3. Phrase questions to require a short answer or check-

mark only.
4. Phrase questions so that the answers can easilyvbe

compiled statistically. I
5. Ask only for information that you believe is readily

available.

When using statistics:

1. Insist on accuracy.

2. Do not confuse the problem with inappr0priate statis-
tics. Use statistics only when necessary to present basic facts.

3. Do not draw conclusions on statistics alone. Consider
the human element, special circumstances, and so on.

In neighborhood studies:

1. Train your canvassers carefully.

2. Do not permit them to express their personal thoughts
or imply the department’s position in a conclusive manner.

3. Require each interviewer to show identification to each .
resident indicating his connection with the recreation de- I
partlnent.

4. Use door-to-door canvasses only when absolutely
necessary.

5. When such canvasses are necessary, use each visit as
a means of extending and stimulating interest in the pro-

gram. Let it be a constructive experience for both the em-
ployee and resident.

How to Make Research Count

When undertaking research in your city be sure to:

1. Assign a qualified person to the job.

2. Place him high enough in the organization structure
so that he will be thoroughly conversant with department
policy, operating problems, and program.

3. Let it he a full-time ob, if possible—at least give him
plenty of time.

4. Sell every member of your staff and your board on the
importance of research.

5. Conduct research only on vital problems. An operat-
ing agency cannot afford to engage in basic research un-
less it answers a pressing problem.

6. cooperate with colleges and universities and students
doing research. Bend over backwards, if need he. to aid
them; it may aid you, too, later on.

7. Always use results of research to change or confirm '

policies, programs, and operations. Give research credit for
whatever decisions are made.

In a nutshell, an operating agency cannot afford to neglect
research any more than a university can. It is the backbone
of all modern professions. It must be the backbone of ours.
It is the combined responsibility of recreation administra-
tors, program leaders, educators, and everyone else inter—
ested in the recreation movement. Research is the key to
the enlarged programs and services that must be developed
to take care of tomorrow’s increased leisure. Through re-
search let us make ready today for the years and years
ahead. I I

to all participants. It was hardly con-
ceivable that some six hundred boys

playing junior baseball during the sum-
mer months would be able to obtain reg-
ular health certificates from private
physicians, so the following steps were
taken to provide these through the de-
partment of recreation—at a very small
cost to the sponsoring agency:

 

1. A local, civic-minded physician
volunteered to establish a committee of
other doctors who would volunteer their
services on one Saturday to examine
the boys.

2. Junior Baseball Association of-
ficials were notified where and when the
examination would be held.

3. Teams in the three leagues had
definite examination-time schedules to
eliminate unnecessary waiting and in-
convenience.

4'. Routing sheets and combination
registration-report cards were drawn up
for each boy.* These included such in-
formation as age, league, home address,
phone number, and space for a report.
Here the examining doctors could in-
dicate each boy’s condition in the fol-
categories:
heart, lungs, hernia, skin.

5. Each doctor conducted only one
phase of the examination; thereby, a

was established.

few uncooperative volunteer managers
remove their teams from the area before
they were examined, some four hun-
dred boys were examined, and the find-
ings were highly enlightening. In fact,
some possible tragedies probably were
averted. Two serious heart cases and
other doubtful heart conditions were
discovered, of which the parents were
unaware, as well as a great number of
sight deficiencies—from minor to very
serious in nature—numerous cases of
hernia, and some chronic skin disor«-
ders.

Although Montebello started “Opera-
tion Well Boy” for an organized extra-
departmental baseball league, it is, of
course, equally or even more valid for
other sports activities, such as touch
football, basketball, and so on. Greater
stress was placed upon examining the
pre-teen group because physical exam-
inations do not become stringent in
most school districts until boys reach
the junior high school or secondary
grades. In the cases of teen-age boys
who had received a complete school ex-
amination, a confirming note from the
school physician, or school nurse was
accepted in lieu of the examination by
the local recreation department.

Can This Project Be Improved?

Since this was a pioneer project, it is
natural that some errors were made.
One, for example, was that volunteer
team managers were depended upon to
deliver the results of each boy’s examin-
ation to his parents. Some managers
failed to do this. It is quite conceiv-
able that, as more agencies adOpt this
or a similar plan, improvements will be
made.

The recreation department in Monte-
bello found a great deal of assistance
was offered by local and metropolitan
Los Angeles newspapers, radio and tele-
vision, and even the international news
services, such as INS and AP. Editors
and reporters know that citizens are
always interested in the welfare of their
children. Thus, the public was made
aware of another service being pro-
vided for them by their local public rec-
reation department. As a valuable by-
product, excellent public relations were
established. Similar cooperation could
be forthcoming in most localities. I

twenty years. For the past six years he
has carried important field and admin-

been a local executive for the Boy
Scouts in Massachusetts, assistant su-
perintendent of recreation in Lincoln,
Nebraska, and superintendent of recre-
ation in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Lake-
land, Florida.

Mr. Lathr0p, who has been with the
Association since 1946, is well-known
for his assistance to state agencies and
officials concerned with recreation in
the eighteen western states he has serv-
ed during recent years, and for his many
years of service in the field of parks and
recreation in Minnesota before that.
He is a life director of 'the National Con-
ference of State Parks. On January 1,
he is taking up new duties as director
of the Colorado State Park and Recrea-
tion Board. Good luck, Harold!

WIDE, ACTIVE participation in the af-

fairs of the community theater is
encouraged for all citizens in Palo Alto,
California. As this theater operates as
a division of the Palo Alto Recreation
Department, the most important of its
specific aims is to provide participants
with opportunities for interesting and
creative recreation activities. Its pri-
mary, broad aim, of course, is to pro-
vide entertainment for the local public
in terms of highest quality, taste, and
excellence. Results are social participa-
tion, creative effort, and a feeling of
friendliness.

Realization of those aims is help-
ed by the fact that it is the only com-
munity theater in the United States
completely tax supported, operating on
an annual budget of over $25,000.
The seven major productions presented
each season sometimes turn back as
much as $16,000 a year to the city
treasury and play to thousands of resi-
dents of Palo Alto and the San Fran-
cisco Bay area.

The Pan Alto Community Theatre
did not become successful overnight.
In 1931 a group of actors met at the
community house, a \Vorld war 1
frame building by the railroad tracks.
The conditions under which they work-
cd were far from ideal. Sets were
built of wrapping paper that rattled
when trains went by; production ex-
penses were necessarily kept at a mini-
mum.

construction of the present building,

of the building, which originally cost
$44,000. Citizcns, in receiving this
gift, automatically accepted the respon-
sibility of supporting it in subsequent
years.

As the adult theater division of the
recreation department, the community
theater is governed by the pc0ple of
Palo Alto through the city council, the
city manager, and the superintendent
of recreation. The theater has its own
organized body of lay members whose
objective is the production of drama
of the highest possible quality. This
group of nine members, known as the
Executive Board of the Palo Alto Com-
munity Players, gives its time and con-
sideration, in an advisory capacity, to
the theater’s professional staff. The

board selects the plays, outlines the
season, and decides policies that will
result in an efficient working out of
the theater’s activities.

Committee System

To stimulate participation and help
solve the innumerable problems arising
on each production, a committee sys-
tem has been adopted. Committee
chairmen are appointed by the execu-
tive board.

“Recreation Rick”
Aids a
Levy Campaign

 

With the help of a saucy, tousle-haired cartoon character
named “Recreation Rick,” the recreation commission in
Painesville, Ohio, staged a successful campaign to renew
a recreation mill levy November 1956. A timetable of the
important events before Painesville’s election, and the role
played by “Recreation Rick,” may be helpful to others in
waging future campaigns.

March 19. Recreation commission chose two co-chairmen
for the citizens’ recreation levy committee.

May 21. Resolution for levy renewal (one half mill for five-
year period) adopted by city council.

August 3. Co-chairmen met with Robert B. Oldfather, com-
mission chairman, and Charles S. Brand, recreation di-
rector, to outline plans. .
September 10. Letters sent to twenty-five steering commit-
tee prospects, calling meeting.

September 17. First meeting of steering committee with
twenty-one attending. Committee chosen for finance, pub-
licity, and paid advertising, speakers’ bureau, and corre-
spondence.

October 1. Steering committee meeting—committee reports.
Adman Neal Brown gave birth to “Recreation Rick” as the
slogan and symbol of the campaign. Subsequent meetings
were of individual committees.

20

October 12-15. Letters were distributed in school assemo
blies, asking students to get their parents to “vote for fun”
and the recreation levy on November 6.

October 15—November 5. Speakers talked before various
groups. Letters to editor and editorials appeared in news-
paper urging levy renewal.

October 25. Panel discussion on local radio about levy.
October 29. Junior patrols distributed brochures to every
home in the city.

October 29—November 5. Colored posters of “Recreation
Rick” appeared in downtown store windows. Drop-in ads of
“Recreation Rick” were placed in local newspaper (all
spaces were donated by advertisers).

November 3. Bandwagon with high school band members
toured city on donated truck with huge sign: “Renew the
Recreation Levy.”

November 5. Picture of bandwagon on front page of local
newspaper. Eighth-graders distributed doorknob hangers
to every home in the city.

November 6. Levy passed.

November 26. Received statement bills and cancelled checks
from finance committee ($306 raised from donors).
November 27. Thank-you letters sent to all who helped.
November 30. Levy fund report sent to board of elections. 
Difficulties Encountered: The board of elections did not i
want to put the word “recreation” on the ballot (live city
issues were up for a vote). City Manager Paul D. Cook was
instrumental in convincing the board that “recreation”
should appear on the ballot. When information was re-
quested regarding the number assigned the levy on the
ballot, “Number 16” was mistakenly given by the election
board. Luckily it was discovered that the levy was actually
“Number 9” and at the last minute changes were made on
the brochures and doorknob hangers. Confusion on these
two items could have defeated the recreation levy (two of
the five issues failed), but “Recreation Rick” triumphed. I

Plan that

New Art

and
Cm t Room

Arne W. Randall

Suggestions for its lay-
out and equipment.

IF ONE WERE forced to be specific about the details es-
sential to a satisfactory art and craft program for recre-
alion purposes, and to specify the building and facilities
necessary to keep it in Operation, the recommendations
would vary with the people and area. Yet, there are a few
pertinent points upon which we can agree.

An art—recreation room should provide an environment
that will stimulate true creative experience. In planning it,
advantage should be taken of every good new development
in materials and furnishings. Its design should provide
ample floor space, a flexible arrangement of furniture, and
adequate storage cahinets to meet either the craft or
graphic interests, or both. One large room may be sub-
divided by a collapsible partition so that a variety of ac-
tivities may be carried on simultaneously; and a surround-
ing outdoor area can be conveniently used in good weather.

The fact must be accepted that an art-craft program is
,just as strong as its leader. The inevitable changes of
leadership must call for flexibility of equipment and facili-
ties, the realistic keynote of an art-craft room. A good

program depends upon:
1. Utilizing the strong interests of the leaders. If one

is predominantly a painter, painting will be the basic ac-
tivity; if one is mechanically inclined, stress will, perhaps,
be on the use of power equipment. A community should
avail itself of the services of specialists, be they weavers,
ceramists, or other types of artists. Storing materials dur-
ing leadership changes should be anticipated.

2. Regional interests that may be climatic as well as re-
gional. In the Southwest, for instance, leather work is an
important activity because of the cowboy influence. In the
North where winter sports are popular, craft work is often
related to skiing, skating, or to indoor sports.

Technological College, Lubbock, Texas.

water or “damp area,” should be accessible from all parts oi
the room. Compartments below the sink are for storage, witll
a zinc-lined bin for clay and plaster. Dispensers for soap,
towels and containers for waste diSposal should be provided.

3. Availability of certain materials. In the Pacific North,
west, woodcarving may be p0pular because of the large
quantities of wood products; palm fronds may be in de-i;
mand for craft uses in tr0pical climates. ’

4. Facilities. A community planning a new huilding
should consult architects and manufacturers of professional
equipment because the cost, quantity, quality, and type of
materials to be used will vary with groups. If an older:
building is being remodeled, many available makeshift
materials can be used in the interim. Community leader-
ship and endowment dictate the programs and their extent.

It is recommended that the size of the art rooms be de-
termined by the approximate number of people who might
use the space. Accepted dimensions are: large plants——
30’ x 60’, inside dimensions; medium plants—24’ x 50’,
inside dimensions; srnall plants-#243 x 371/2’, inside di-r
mensions. Rooms should be at least eleven feet high.

The very best facilities available for heating, lighting-
ventilating, and sanitation should be used. Art activity
rooms and laboratories should maintain an approximate
temperature of 65° to 68° F., with a recommended rela-
tive humidity of 45 per cent.

Lighting experts and engineers should be consulted to
provide a uniform distribution of artificial and natural
shadow-free and glare-free illumination for work on either.
dark days or evenings. Numerous outlets will provide for
adjustable modern spotlighting and strategic additional
lighting when necessary. Overhead power outlets provide
for safety and flexibility.

Kilns and other appliances need pr0perly located out-

outlets for both llO-volt and 220-volt service, installed
flush with the floor or from the ceiling on a center line
of the room, permit use of equipment in a central area and
eliminate dangerous cord extensions. Permanently in-
stalled electric power equipment, especially kilns, should

ij Cas outlets and fireproof counter surfacing for metal-

used in an enclosed area for larger soldering and an-
!aling work. A master valve that can be locked should
ntrol these, but a separate connection and valve lock

ould be provided if a gas-fired kiln is used.
If at all possible there should be an acid-resistant all-
rpose double sink, at least fifteen inches deep, with drain
rds at both ends. It is helpful if this can extend into

l anls, programs should allow for un-

Sound-insulating wall treatment will reduce noises; wall
nd cciling acoustical surfacing is a good investment.

Sectional and movable furniture adds flexibility for vari-
us arrangements, thereby allowing people to work individ-
ally or in groups. The following list of furniture is suf-

cient for equipping one average art room:

35 individual worktables for art or crafts
35 highback individual chairs

6 stools with round wooden tops, 4- legs, approximately 18%” in
height

number of ways. Used materials, though, are not a sub-
stitute for good new materials.

Storage Space

There is never enough storage space; every inch should
be utilized. There should be shelves, at least seven feet
high, on three sides of the room for storing expendable art
materials; and compartments for standard-size art stock
should be built below the counter. Suilicient storage space
for art-craft work in progress should be provided.
Placement of materials:

1. Paints, acids, cleaners should be stored in a closed
metal cabinet. Paints should be kept closed; solvents and
thinners should be stored in safety cans; acids and other
toxic materials should be so labeled.

2. Oil rags and wastes should be disposed of immediately.
Use only waste cans with hinged covers.

3. Fire equipment should be near the door and easy to
reach.

4. Heavy materials should be stored low.

5. Everything should be stored within reaching height.

6. Floor storage and cluttered floors should be avoided.

7. Storage trays should be used for convenience.

8. Expendable materials should be stored in convenient

and appropriate places, and protected from deterioration.

 

Familiar tools, like old friends, can
slart a newcomer on an unfamiliar
activity with some self-confidence.

Safety

To realize the objectives of the art program, adequate
working tools are necessary. To avert accidents the proper
use of the sharp tools must be demonstrated.

The supervisor should: Keep tools sharp and in good con-
dition; install proper guards and safety devices; see that all
equipment is painted with the safety colors recommended
by the American Standards Association; post instructions for
proper use of tools in clearly visible spots; check under-
writer’s warranty on power equipment.

T he user should: Study instructions on use of tools as
posted on bulletin board; use tools correctly. Most acci-
dents occur with use of improper tools or with incorrect
use of the right tool. He should cut away from himself in
using cutting tools; always work on benches of the proper
height; work only with safety guards in proper position; be
careful not to crowd around another person using power
equipment, acids, hot plates, or other dangerous equipment. I

George D. Butler

RECREATION is a basic human need. Because this is true,
the provision of parks and other recreation areas has
been recognized in law, in practice, and in public opinion as
an essential function of government. The concept of space
standards implies a considerable degree of agreement as to
the recreation needs and interests of pe0ple and the space and
facilities required to serve them. The dictionary definition
of a standard most applicable to this topic is “that which is
set up and established by authority, custom, or general con-
sent as a model or example; i.e., criterion.” Therefore, until
proposals have been well established, tested by experience,
and accepted, they do not merit the name of standards.

The dictionary concept of a standard is hardly applicable
to parks and recreation areas because people’s interests, de-
sires, and demands for recreation change, with the result
that space and facility requirements need to be modified
accordingly. This limitation should be kcpt in mind in dis-
cussing so-called park and recreation area standards. They
must be temporary, flexible, and subject to change.

Planning Today for the Parks of Tomorrow

This is probably best illustrated by the evolution of play-
ground space standards. Perhaps the first suggestion for
a children’s playground standard was contained in a plan
for the District of Columbia and announced when the Na-
tional Recreation Association was organized in 1906. It
called for thirty square feet of play space per child, or one
acre to care for 1,400 children. Over the years the function

of the playground has been gradually expanded, requiring

a revision of its essential facilities and space requirements.
Today we no longer talk about the children’s playground,
but the neighborhood playground to serve all ages; its space
is now measured in acres, not in square feet per child, and

sociation. A new edition. of his familiar book, Recreation
Areas—~Their Design and Equipment ( Ronald Press), will

it is increasingly considered as one unit in a combined-
neighborhood park-school-playground.

Few will disagree with the statement that the reason for
providing park and recreation space is to meet the needs
of people. Therefore I submit that any standard for such
space must definitely be related to population. Yet space
pr0posals are repeatedly made that ignore this basic factor.

Standards cannot be established until the following fac-
tors have been determined or at least closely estimated:

1. The basic recreation needs of pe0ple.

2. Activities serving the needs of all age groups.

3. The degree to which people will respond to recreation
opportunities, if offered.

4. The optimum effective service radius of areas and fa-
cilities.-

5. Space required to accommodate the number of people
participating in various activities.

The variables involved further emphasize the need for
frequent revision of standards, and the difficulty in securing
universal acceptance of them. Perhaps no aspect of park
and recreation service has given rise to as much misunder-
standing, misinformation, and confusion as have space
standards and their application. People who write about
standards or attempt to apply them often fail to distinguish I
between different types of areas, their functions, and space
requirements and their relation to population units. Because
of a failure to interpret or apply them correctly, commu-
nities are often misguided in their efforts to dcvelop an
adequate system of parks and recreation areas. Let me cite
one or two examples.

Judging Adequacy of Space

The standard calling for an acre of recreation space for 1
each one hundred of a city’s p0pulation has been widely
adopted becausc it is easy to remember, easy to apply, and
has proved generally satisfactory. Until someone comes
along with a bctter one, it scems to have validity for general
application. However, it is merely one index of adcquacy.

not a complete one. A city with only half the acreage called
for by the standard, but with that well distributed among
areas of different types, sizes and deve10pment, is probably
better off than a city with the standard amount in a single
property or in areas unsuitable for park use.

Standards representing only minimum requirements tend
to become accepted as the desirable norm and _it is therefore
difiicult to acquire more. When a dual set of standards—
minimum and desirable—-is adOpted, this is likely to hap-
pen. Standards should state the amount of space considered
adequate and desirable. A city meeting them is quite cer-
tain to have satisfactory areas. Even so, in time the stand-
ards tend to become inadequate to meet changing condi-
tions and needs, unless revised.

A common misunderstanding is the failure to differen-
tiate between the amount of space set by a standard and the
amount feasibly attainable in a given city. The standard
of one acre per one hundred, for example, has been criti-
cized as being unrealistic for the large city. However, if
based on people’s needs, it is equally valid for the metrOp-
olis. In fact, there is need for more public recreation space
in the denselypOpulated city than in the average commu-
nity. Admittedly, some large cities cannot h0pe to attain
or even approach the over-all standard, but this means that
the city is unable to meet it, not that the standard is at fault.
For, as John Howard, past president of the American Insti-
tute of Planners, has said: “The fact that land costs twice
as much per square foot in one city (or neighborhood) as
in another is not a valid excuse for chiseling a ‘standard.’ ”

Where a standard cannot be met, the fact should be faced
and admitted rather than camouflaged by substituting an
inadequate so-called standard. Yet one hears repeatedly
that a lower “standard” should be applied to the large city.

Considering Types of Areas

Space standards have long been established and widely
adOpted for the neighborhood playground and the playfield
—the types required to scrve all residential sections and
providing a variety of active human uses. Yet these stand-

rds have been completely ignored in park and recreation
|Erea plans prepared for several cities. For example, in a
lrecent report on an eastern city, the planning consultant
did not mention the term “neighborhood playground” but
recommended “children’s playgrounds” with a minimum
ltotal size of .23 acres each. He proposed a minimum of
ne acre as a standard for a “junior playfield,” although
[ii was admitted that the standard set up by most cities is
two acres. The elementary school was indicated as the best
location for the playfield. The standards proposed in the
'report bore no relationship whatsoever to the widely ac-
epted concepts of the playground and the playfield, and
the people were given no indication that adOption of the
proposals would still leave the city with woefully inadequate
reas. Such misuse of the term is simply indefensible.
. Types of pr0perties with such characteristic features as
aried topography, Open lawn, woodland, and stream valley
do not lend themselves to a specific space formula. 0f the
many areas for which standards have been pr0posed, I
would like to refer briefly to two types—those serving a resi-

JANUARY 1958

(lential neighborhood and others applicable to extraurban
properties.

The neighborhood playground and the neighborhood
park, as you know, comprise the first group. The play-
ground is a place where the people of the neighborhood,
especially school-age children, can engage in a wide variety
of play activities in an attractive setting. The neighbor-
hood park, on the other hand, is essentially a place for rest
and relaxation, and the landscape features are of primary
importance. For many years, partly because of a belief that
the two functions were not compatible in a single area, sepa-

rate standards were used for the neighborhood park and
the neighborhood playground.

Standards in Use

On the basis of a careful analysis of the space required
to serve basic. neighborhood recreation needs, the National
Recreation Association in 1943 prepared and widely circu-
lated space standards for the neighborhood playground,
which were believed applicable to every residential neigh-
borhood. They called for a playground within a quarter- to
a half-mile of every home, depending upon neighborhood
conditions, varying in size from three and one-quarter acres
for a neighborhood of two thousand to six acres for five
thousand people. You will note that more space per popula-
tion unit was recommended for the smaller neighborhood.
A city’s total playground needs, however, were believed
to be one acre for each eight hundred of its present or
estimated future p0pulation. Location of the playground
at or adjoining the elementary school site was generally
recommended. These standards were widely adopted and
have exerted a marked influence upon playground planning
throughout the nation. They have long merited a complete
reappraisal, even though many cities still fall far short.

The neighborhood park, because of its nature, does not
lend itself to such precise space standards. Consequently
proposed standards vary considerably from one city to
another. Doubtless the most valid prOposal was made by
a committee of the American Public Health Association,
which recognized the relationship between the need for
neighborhood park space and population density. It there-
fore recommended two acres of neighborhood park per
one thousand persons in a neighborhood with a multiple-
family deve10pment as contrasted with seven—tenths of an
acre per one thousand persons in one with one- or two-family
dwellings. The question may well be raised whether there
is need for a neighborhood park in the increasing number
of deve10pments with from one to four families per acre.

Proposals

Significant pr0posals for neighborhood space standards
have been made in recent years, several of which involve
the park-scliool-playground idea. For example, the facili-
ties conference sponsored in 1956 by The Athletic Institute
recommended that the “neighborhood park-recreation cen-
ter,” combining the features of the neighborhood park and
playground, should comprise fifteen acres or more. The
same acreage was prOposed for the “neighborhood park-
school,” serving the same functions, but including an ele-

25

 

mentary school. The service radius recommended for both
was one-quarter to one-half mile, or the same as the NRA
proposal.

The California Committee on Planning for Recreation
Park Areas and Facilities, following a comprehensive study,
also recommended in 1956 that a recreation center be pro-
vided for each neighborhood, in the form of a “recreation
park,” or a park in combination with an elementary school.
Space and service area standards were proposed for neigh-
borhoods of different types, densities, and sizes. From six-
teen- to twenty-acre sites were recommended to serve neigh-
borhoods of two thousand to forty-five hundred people, the
effective service radius varying from one-eighth to three-
eighths of a mile.

These recent proposals represent significant modifica-
tions in earlier concepts of the neighborhood park and play-
ground. They recognize, for example, the feasibility of com-
bining park, playground, and school functions on a single
site; the necessity of cooperative planning by school and
municipal authorities in the acquisition and development
of areas to serve the recreation use of both; the need for
acquiring properties larger than those called for by previous
standards; and—in the California report—the desirability
of reducing the effective service radius of the neighborhood
areas. They have a relationship to the space standards pro-
posed for the elementary school by the National Council
on Schoolhouse Construction; namely, “a minimum site of
five acres plus an additional acre for each one hundred pu-
pils of ultimate enrollment.” These proposals merit careful
consideration, but additional experience in their local ap-
plication is required before they merit nation-wide adop-
tion. These newer concepts call for greatly eXpanded space
—in many cities more than double the amount now required.

Let us turn our attention for a moment from the neighbor-
hood to the open country. The desire of large numbers of
people to get away from the city for day outings or weekends
has created a rising demand for large outlying parks and
reservations, and a resulting need for space standards to
serve as a guide in the development of acquisition plans.
Several agencies have long proposed that one acre in out-
lying parks and recreation areas be set aside for each one
hundred of population of a city and its surrounding metro-
politan area, in addition to the municipal parks within the
city limits. These outlying areas, usually provided by
county, regional, state, or federal authorities, should he
within an hour’s ride from any part of the region. They make
possible such activities as camping, fishing, boating, pic-
nicking, hiking, and nature study.

Several recent proposals reflect the growing demand for
additional extraurban parks. One of these, made at the 1956
meeting of the American Institute of Planners, called for
ten acres per thousand in metropolitan parks, playgrounds,
and beaches plus twenty acres per thousand in small game-
hunting and fishing areas within seventy miles of urban
centers, or a total of thirty acres per thousand people. A

second proposal by a regional planning commission would
provide ten acres in county and regional parks and ten addi-
tional acres in state-owned areas per thousand people in

26

a metropolitan region, or twenty extraurban acres per thou
sand. Tentative standards recently developed,by a federa

agency call for a still greater acreage.

Looking Ahead

What about the future? Here are four factors, bound t
influence park and recreation space standards in the year.

ahead:

1. Rapidly changing urban conditions—the shorter wor
week, more leisure, higher incomes, automation, the disap-
pearance of open spaces, increased highway traffic-40 men-
tion a few—make necessary the acquisition of more munici
pal park and recreation acreage for the benefit of the peo—
ple; hence higher space standards for neighborhood, com-
munity, and citywide areas. More opportunities for recrea-
tion must be provided within easy reach, especially in the
older sections of our cities.

2. Increasing competition for available urban space.
rising costs of land acquisition and development, and the
growing duplication of space and facility requirements for
parks and for school sites make inevitable greater emphasi
upon cooperative action in the acquisition, development.
operation, and use of neighborhood and community recrea-
tion areas. Such cooperative action justifies higher area
standards and assures more diversified develOpment; lack
of it will make virtually impossible the acquisition of ade-
quate areas.

3. Fringe areas around our metropolitan cities must re-
ceive greater consideration. Most present-day park and rec-
reation standards relate to municipalities only, and rela-
tively little consideration has been given to the requirements
of outlying, unincorporated communities. Yet the greatest
population growth is taking place in them. The need for
creating greenbelts around our major urban centers is be-

 

coming increasingly apparent. A study designed to dcvelop'
such standards for the rapidly expanding percentage of the
country’s population living in fringe areas is urgently
needed.

4-. Improved major highways, longer weekends, and
mounting public interest in outing activities are bound to
result in a greater demand for more large parks at a dis-
tance from the city, whether provided by the city, county,
regional, state, or federal authorities. The development of
more adequate standards for regional park and 1‘ccrcation
areas is essential to sound planning and c00perative action.
which will provide the areas and facilities needed for day
outings and weekend use.

Many of our park systems today are the result of far-
sighted planning and action on the part of our forefathers.
Today, when the need for parks and recreation facilities is
far greater, we should have the wisdom and courage to fol-
low their example, and thus assure, for our children, a rich
heritage for their leisure time. Careful planning and de-
cisive action on the part of all interested individuals and

groups are necessary to help develop more satisfactory stand-

ards of park and recreation space, and to apply them in your
localities where they will contribute to better living in the

America of tomorow. I

The Complete Book
of Children’s Play

Ruth E. Hartley and Robert M. Gold-
son. Thomas Y. Crowell, 432 Fourth
venue, New York 16. Pp. 462. $5.00.

Here is one of the most important
. oks published recently in the recrea-
ion field. If I were an instructor in a
llege or university, and had classes
n any phase of recreation, this book
'ould be required reading for my stu-
nts. If I were a superintendent of
ecreation, this book would be the basis
or pre-service and in-service training.
f l were a chairman in the national or
ocal PTA, 1 would plan programs
round this book. If I were a Scout
ader, a leader in any group work
ency, or a parent, I would read and
-read this book.

Books on activities can be found by
1e dozen. Books on the choice of activ-
ies, the meaning of play, its values in

e development of the child, are hard
0 come by and much needed.

The first half of the book, dealing
_'ith thc child under eight and his activ-
ties, is by Dr. Hartley, psychologist
nd consultant on children’s problems.
‘he second half, dealing with children
rom eight through adolescence, is by
_)r. Goldenson, psychology professor
nd guidance specialist. His chapter on
Play in the Pre-tcens” is excellent and
-1 vers a period of childhood often neg-
cted in favor of the pre-school or
olescent age.

The value of this book is increased
150 by a very comprehensive appen-
lix, with lists of equipment and sup-
)lies, records, song books, hooks, hob-
)y information sources, magazine list-
igs, and organization listings. As a
esource guide, this appendix is accu-
ate and comprehensive. — V irgfnia

Covering the Leisure-time Field

or private recreation agency.

We can think of no more engrossing
or interesting art or craft project than
working out together, as a group, a mu-
ral for decoration, to relive a trip or
tour, or to share interesting experi-
ences. Such a project would offer an
opportunity to experiment with many
art media and various techniques, rang-
ing from simple paper cutouts to the
use of wire, aluminuln, plastics, oils,
mosaics, and so on. It is one that can
be adOptcd for any age group—a whole
new area of creative activity.

The book is illustrated by many
sketches and photographs of youngsters
engrossed in working on a common pro-
ject. Its content is written simply, com-
prehensively, and in an engaging style.
Mr. Randall is the author of the article,
“Plan That Art and Craft Room,” which

appears on page 22 of this issue.

Gardening—A New World
For Cllildren’l‘

Sally Wright. Macmillan Company,
60 Fifth Avenue, New York ll. Pp.
183. $2.75.

This book may be intended for adults
with youngsters whom they wish to in-
terest in gardening, but this adult found
it as entertaining as a novel. Any one
with even a slightly green thumb will
be intrigued by Mrs. Wright’s vast num-
ber of interesting garden projects. Im-
agine planning a sense-of-time garden,
or a nose garden, an odd-behavior gar-
den or a believe-it-or-not garden! And
these ideas are backed up by lists of
plants or seeds, with sources from which
they may be bought.

In addition to gardens, the book sug-
gests excellent side lines to real garden-
ing—like the nostalgic Flower dolls.
cornhusk dolls, flower necklaces, holi-
day ideas, use of vegetables and plants
in serving a meal, indoor gardens, and
dozens of other idcas that would appeal
to any type of youngster.

It is far more than a book on garden-
ing. 1t spills over into natural, simple,
and irresistible techniques for develop-
ing an interest in, and an appreciation
for, nature.

The author’s preniise, incidently, is

“ Available from the NRA Recreation Book
Center, 8 West Eighth Street, New York 11.

 

“emphatically not a garden-for-every-
child. Rather, it is not the same garden
[or oil children. It offers thc idea of
gardens compatible with their other in-
terests—gardens that extend horizons
and indulge whims and fancies.”

If you conduct any activities involv-
ing nature, and if you have childrcn or
friends with children and garden Spacc,
this is a book that will be treasured.

Professional Preparation
of Recreation Personnel

American Association for Health,
Physical Education, and Recreation,
1201 Sixteenth Street, N.W., Washing-
ton 6. Pp 48. Paper $1.00.

This is the report of the November
1956 Washington Conference sponsored
by the American Association for
Health, Physical Education, and Recre-
ation, the Association for Higher Edu-
cation, and the National Commission
for Teacher Education and Professional
Standards. The National Recreation
Association was one of eight cooper.
ating organizations. Eighty-two delc-
gates from thirty-eight statcs attended.

Its purpose was to formulate some
recommendations for hetter programs
of professional preparation for those
entering the field of recreation. Con-
sideration was given to courses, other
than specialized courses in recreation,
that should be included in the under-
graduate and graduate major courses;
and to the specialized recrcation courses
and expcrience that should he included
in the undergraduate and graduate rec-
reation curriculums. Also included were
the specialized recreation major cur-
riculum for such fields as industry,
camping, hospitals, and institutions;
recommendations for pcrsonnel, faculty,
and facilities; the undergraduate and
graduate curriculums, and preparation
for specialized leadership. The report

The Cluhwoman’s
Entertainment Book

Lawrence M. Brings. T. S. Denison,
321 Fifth 'Avenue South, Minneapolis
15, Minnesota. Pp. 482. $4.50.

This is the sort of book often re-
quested by women’s clubs, PTA’s, ladies’
guilds, and the like. Such groups fre-
quently wish to put on short skits, pan-
tomimes, playlets, and one-act plays,

solely for group entertainment, which-

require no particular skill in acting and
the simplest of sets and costumes. They
are not looking for art, but -for comic
situations at which they can laugh with
each other.

Within the above limitations, this
book will be very helpful. Nothing in
it is designed to uplift, instruct, or
point a moral. It is all very simple
humor (with the exception of one
Easter play that must have heen in-
cluded by mistake) but the selections
are in good taste. Eight of the one-act
plays in Section Five (plays, comedies,
and farces) are available in single
c0pies for convenience of individuals
in memorizing their parts. Cast for
these skits, playlets, and plays range
from two to fourteen persons—all
women.

PARKS AND CONSERVATION

Among a recent flurry of books on
this subject are:

Exploring Our National Parks and
Monuments (Revised Fifth Edition),
Devereux Butcher. Houghton Mifflin,
2 Park Street, Boston, Pp. 288. $5.00.

This is a revised and enlarged edition
of one of those park books that are
filled with beautiful photographs in
color and in black and white. It can be
a marvelous help in planning a vacation

changes, tell how they came about, what
they may mean for the future, and dis-
cuss some of the alternatives for deal-
ing with them. They-conclude that if
the full potential of the federal lands
is to be achieved, it is time for a major
and critical re-examination of federal
land management. Against a back-
ground of detailed and authoritative in-
formation, they suggest practical ways
in which federal land management can
be revised to realize the maximum
potential.

Conservation: An American Story of
Conflict and Accomplishment, David
Cushman Coyle. Rutgers University
Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Pp. 284. $5.00.

Theodore Roosevelt’s Governors9
Conference in May of 1908 marked the
beginning of the conservation move-
ment in the United States, almost simul-
taneously with the founding of the Na-
tional Recreation Association—also
under the Roosevelt sponsorship. In
the conservation field, Gifford Pinchot
worked with Roosevelt. This book is a
history of the deve10pment of the re-
sources program toward integrated pub-
lic management all the way to the pres-
ent. Illustrated.

Interpreting Our Heritage, Freeman
Tilden. University of North Carolina
Press, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Pp.

110. $3.50.
The word “interpretation” as used

in this book refers to education activi-

ties in relation to our parks, museums,
and historic places. The book sets forth
the basic principles upon which good
interpretation may be built and de-
scribes the best practices for visitor
services.

One chapter deals with “The Mystery
of Beauty,” another with “The Priceless
Ingredient.” Well-written, with a fore-

word by Conrad L. Wirth of the Na-

tional Park Service.

The Federal Lands: Their Use and M an-
agement, Marion Clawson and Burnell
Held. John H0pkins Press, Baltimore
18. Pp. 501. $8.50.

Approximately one-fifth of the total
land area of the United States is feder-
ally owned. Within the past decade the
use of federal lands has become big
business; the shift was so great and so
sudden that many of the methods of
managing the lands are now seriously
out of date. In this book the authors
examine the most important of these

liam G. Vinal. American Humane Edu-
cation Society, 180 Longwood Avenue,

Boston 15. Pp. 322. $3.50 (two or
more c0pies $3.00).

Our old friend of recreation, camping
and the out-of-doors, Cap’n Bill, has
come out with what amounts to a text-
book for leaders to use in teaching
nature activities and conservation to
groups of the young. If anyone knows
the secret of such leadership, it is Cap’n
Bill! His book is intended for the un-
initiated as well as for students in col-
leges of education, and it is bristling
with practical information, know-how
and suggestions. In fact, it is a well-

planned course sure to fire young lea
ers with enthusiasm and offer new ide
to the more experienced. Recommende .

The Boys’ Entertainment Book

Bob Smith. T. S. Denison & Com
pany, 321 Fifth Avenue 5., Minneap
olis 15. Pp. 367. $3.95.

This is not the usual rehash of 01
material. In fact, we were very agre
ably surprised at the freshness of th
stunts, skits, games, shorties (quicki

stunts), and dramatized songs.

Som

are what we adults might call a bi
“corny”—but those who have worke
with camping and club groups kno
that children’s humor is usually no

very subtle.

The hook is full of what,

on th

whole, are good ideas for campfire
rainy days, stunt nights, and so on, i
a rarity, and leaders will find this on

a gold mine. We might quarrel over .
few of its ideas, but what collection i

perfect?

The ghost stories (that old questio

as to whether they should be used i
not the point here) are original, som
carrying a touch of humor or a surpris

ending. A few have enough “scary’

quality to raise a few agreeable goos

pimples. Also, two really excellent In
dian tales have suggestions for thei

dramatization, if desired.

The author has included material tha
can be used by girls’ camps or othe
groups, but, on the whole, it has a defi

nite young male appeal.

, ' very handsome in her new
  blue gown as she stepped onto
the roughhewn platform. Above her,
flags snapped against the summer sky.
Before her, the lady delegates of the
Equal Rights Party stood up and
cheered.

Belva Anne Lockwood accepted their
cheers, and their nomination, to be-
come in 1884 the woman who ran for
the Presidency of the United States.

A gallant choice she was, too. Defy-
ing massive prejudice, she had fought
for and won a college education, a law
degree—the fll‘St ever given an Ameri-
can woman, and, finally, the right to
plead cases before the Supreme Court.
(Where, among other triumphs, she
won a $5,000,000 settlement for the
Cherokee Indians.)

 

HE didn’t expect to be President;

that wasn’t her point. She would

run to make America conscious of
women’s right to political equality. And
run she did. Ridiculed in the press,
hooted on the street, even dcnounced
by fellow-suffragist Susan Anthony. she
nevertheless received 4,159 pOpular
ballots from six states.

More important, of course, she dram-
atized, as no one else had, women’s
battle for the right to vote.

Before Belva Lockwood died, her
fight was won and America had gained
the strength of millions of new "first
class citizens.” her women. That
strength todaylmightily reinforces the
living guarantee behind one of the
world’s soundest investments—United
States Savings Bonds. It is one more
reason why you know that in America’s
Savings Bonds your savings are safe
and your return is sure. For real secu-
rity, buy Savings Bonds, through Pay-
roll Savings or at your bank.

Now Savings Bonds are better than
ever! Every Series E Bond purchased
since February 1, 1957, pays 3-%% in-
terest when held to maturity. It earns
higher interest in the early years than
ever before, and matures in only 8 years

and 11 months. Hold your old E Bonds,
too. They earn more as they get older.
