RECREATION

Stephen F. Bayne, Jr.

The SPIRITUAL Aspects of Play

Taken from Bishop Bayne’s address at the 34th National Recreation Congress,
these words bear thinking upon as we stand on the threshold of a New Year.

THERE have been plenty of times in the history of our

country and of the world when it would have seemed
very odd to have a clergyman talking about play. As a
matter of fact, one of my first ancestors in this country was
thrown into thethe “clink” in Massachusetts, because he in-
sisted on playing—first by having a Christmas tree, which
cost him three days in the clink, and then by insisting on
preserving the old custom of Maypole dancing on the green,
for which he got a week in the clink. That mood often has
been characteristic of official religion, which has tended to
look upon play as something not quite respectable.

In other words, the church has not always been regarded
as willing to think about play. The tendency has been to
get people to feel that play must somehow be made socially
useful, or otherwise respectable, or else it must remain out-
side the sphere of interests of the respectable and prudent
man. We like to moralize things too much, and that has
left us a heritage in American life of a little bit of a bad
conscience.

We are never quite sure that we ought to enjoy ourselves.
People who play, too often are given to finding excuses for
it. You never see a man on a golf course without his telling
you that he worked awfully hard and is very tired. That is
part of the legacy which is not a good legacy. I don’t see
any reason why a person should apologize for playing. I
think he should play as much as he can possibly find time
to play.

There is a Christian doctrine of play; and it is tied up
with the Christian doctrine of work. They are the opposite
sides of the same coin. When you look back on the develop-
ing years of the Christian community, nearly twenty cen-
turies ago, and then trace the development of Christian
thought through those periods until its flowering among
the great theologians, you find a pretty steady, central line
ofthoughL

I will try to put it into very simple terms. First, man
is whole and single. Second, his spiritual wholeness is the
ultimate end of all that he does and all that he is. Third,
his work and his play alike dcrive their meaning from the
fundamental quest to be a mature and full and single per-
son. Therefore his work and his play belong together and
cannot be separated. Play is not an anesthetic for work; it
is a partner of work. One of the favorite illustrations which
in ancient days was used by Christian teachers about the
nature of play was this story about St. John:

St. Jolm, the evangelist, who when someone asked him

THE RIGHT REVEREND STEPHEN BAYNE, JR., has been Bz'shOp
of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia for the past five years.

JANUARY 1953

about whether or not it was right to play, put a bow in the
man’s hands and said, “Flex the bow.” He did. “Flex it
again as far as your can.” He did. St. John said, “Flex it
again.” The man did. This went on. St. John kept saying,
“Keep on, keep on flexing the bow.” Finally the man
said, “This is ridiculous; the bow will break!” St. John
said, “That is exactly what I mean about play—without
its relaxation, man will break.”

Except where life is balanced and whole, the bow will
break. Work, in deepest Christian thought, is not an end
in itself. And that was the sin of the nineteenth century,
as it has been the sin of many other times, that seemed to
say to boys and girls growing up in the world, “Your job
is to work as hard as you can, as long as you can, because
work will somehow win God’s favor.” That is not Christian
doctrine. We work because we need to meet our needs;
we work so that we may have something to give to others;
we work so that we may learn how to praise God with our
work. Work simply serves the needs of this whole and
single person who is the person that God created and is the
person that God loves and redeems. Play, likewise, is part
of the story of life. It is not an end in itself but exists to
serve the wholeness and the singleness of life. When you
learn those things, then you look at the world in which we
live, people with whom we live, and you begin to ask your-
self some extraordinary and searching questions, both
about the function of work and of play in our society.

I am going to say three very simple things to you. First,
the majority of our comrades in this world suffer more
from boredom in their work than any have ever suffered
before. That is mainly, I think, because of the immense
change in our habits of work. We have been set free to
an extraordinary degree from drudgery. When we look
back to the limits, confines, and harshness and cruelty of
life for our forebears, we do well to give thanks for the
marvelous way in which techniques have set us free of
those harsh simplicities. The price we have paid for it often
is that the jobs most of us are called upon to do most of
the time are trivial jobs and boring jobs. It is harder and
harder for many men, not all men. Not always for men
in jobs like yours and mine, which are personal jobs and
bring a great deal of satisfaction with them. But if a man’s
work is boring to him, then his play will be interpreted
simply as time of excitement or a kind of diversion to bury
boredom or to extinguish it with another boredom. True
play, like true work, should never tire because it should
never seem trivial. If the job is right and the man is right
—the work is right, and the play is right. But when we
deal with bored people, their play is as bored as is their

445

work. That is where you and l hoth take hold of life.

Second, the work that our people do tcnds to de-person.
alize. It tends to make man seem less than human in many
aspects of his life, in his own eyes. When you use maehines
more. and more, it is almost inescapable that before too
long, the question is going to arise in your minds as to
just who is the more important in the scale of values, the
measure of ultimatc value and worth, you or the machine?

50, Me, in the last place, I say our work and our play
alike suffer because we have lost the kind of wholeness
from life. Howevcr, and I think it may be the most impor-
tant part of a man’s work-walso the most important part
of his play, also the most important part of his whole
life—-is the knowledge that it has value with God. That
it ean be offered to God.

Think back of the people you know who have been good
workers in their gcneration. What made them good was
thc deep and oftcn unspoken assuranee that what they did
and the life thcy lived meant somcthing in God’s eyes, and
had an importance that came because it eould be oficred to
him. How many people do we know that have that feeling
about thcir jobs or their play or their very selves? Be-
cause we have lost the assurance of being able to pattern all
our life, our work, our play, and oursclves together in one
bundle and oficr the whole thing to God, our lives have
tcnded to fall apart and our jobs fall off here somewhere,
whcre they are only an ugly necessity which exists mainly
for its own sake. We have seen this happening to pe0ple.

Those are thc peOple to whom you and I minister; I in onc

way, you in another way. PeOple whose jobs, lives, and
destinies, whose play. is trivial. boring, unimportant, un-
related to God; pe0ple, whose selves, whose personalities,
bear the marks of that uncertain fragmcntary people. There
are too many of them in this world. And as I close l would
ask you only to think this of what you do.

Iicmemher that triviality of the boredom; and in what
you do. plan to minister some deeper meaning than man‘s
work oftcn givcs it. If his life is torn apart by a job that
is meaningless, it may be that his play will restore a lost
depth and quality to his life. If his work seems to be
trivial and unimportant, it may be within his play that he
will discovcr something which to him will he important
enough to hold his whole attention and his whole will. The
less that he puts himself into his job, it may bc, that thc
more hc will put hinisclf into his play and so become a
person through his hobhics and through his play. Those
are thc opportunities that lie in your hands to do; to inin-
ister wholeness to people who are fractions of a whole.

I can imagine that your job is much like my own, a job
in whieh it is easy to lose perspective, a job in which it is
very easy to forget or to not see the fundamental importance
of what we do. I would hope that, in those dark and un-
eertain moments, you might find a minute to stop and
think what it is that you are doing. You are really not
ministering recreation; you are not holding down an
important municipal or state or association job; you are
hclping people to be whole and single people who may
find through their play a significance under God.

RECREATION

 

) IN A HISTORY MAKING DECISION, ac-
cording to Planning and Civic Com-
ment, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
recently declared that: “The right of
the citizens of the state to enjoy our
navigable streams for recreational pur-
poses, including the enjoyment Of
scenic beauty, is a legal right that is
entitled to all the protection which is
given financial rights.” This decision
was handed down by the court in de-
claring unconstitutional the state’s so
called “county board” law, enacted in
1947, which gave county officials final
authority to pass upon local dam con-
struction. This decision involved a pro-
posal to erect a dam on the Namekagon
River, famous for its fishing. The
court held that the dam, if erected,
could interfere with public rights of
hunting, fishing, and scenic beauty,
that these are state-wide rights and that
local authorities could not have final
say as to their disposition.

Bond Issues and Referendums

) Recreation took another step forward
in Jacksonville and Duval County,
Florida, during the recent general elec-
tion. Millage setting up a county rec-
reation program was the sole survivor
of the twelve items up for considera-
tion. The referendum was made pos-
sible by a special act of the state
legislature of 1951. One of the sections
provided for cooperation with any mu-
nicipality of the county in acquiring,
Operating and maintaining any facili-
ties created under the provisiOns Of the
act.

)The citizens of Niles, Ohio, success-
fully voted in their tax levy for recrea-
tion for a new five-year period.

)The voters of Cincinnati, Ohio,
passed an 3825.000 bond issue with
$500,000 allotted to the public recrea-
tion commission and $325,000 to the
board of park commissioners. The
passage Of this bond issue will make
possible a program Of rehabilitation,
improvement, and expansion of Cin-
cinnati’s recreation facilities.

}_The voters .authorized the county

County, New Jersey, tO increase the
appropriation of funds for maintenance
of county park and recreation facilities,
from the present limit of three-fourths
of a mill tO a full one mill.

Letters

Hall of ane
Sirs:

l have read the article in the Novem-
ber issue of RECREATION, by Mr.
Thomas Miller. entitled “My Mainten-
ance Man,” which is very good. As we
all know, the maintenance man is the
undercover man, such as the lineman
in football, never receiving much credit
or glory, but actually the foundation of
our program.

We have a man in our organization
whom I would like to mention for the
recreation Hall of Fame—Mr. Dewey
Clifton McAlpin. He has straightened
out our Ford tractors and worked out
several other knotty problems, as well
as invented new ways of maintaining
our various athletic fields to the best
advantage. He has taken equipment
that we have purchased and added to
it to such an extent that we can now
use it for several diflerent, additional
things. He has saved our department
untold money with his clever ideas and
skill in repairing machinery and equip-
ment of all kinds. In fact, he is official
trouble shooter for our entire depart-
ment. “Ask Mac about it,” is the stock
reply to any query or complaint. I do
not know if you are planning a “Hall
of Fame” for the forgotten man, but if
you are, I wish to submit the name of
my maintenance standby for a front
seat.

Something New

Sirs:

Featured in your April, 1952 issue
of RECREATION is an article by Helena
Braddock Lcmp on “Something New in
Playgrounds.” I enjoyed this article
very much and wonder if it is possible
to have enlarged copies of the picture
which accompanied it? I could use five
or six of them, not for commercial use
or reprint, but to show to my board
members, as we are planning play
spaces adjacent to our eleven clubs.

Field Report

Having read the article, “Tom-a-
llawk Club for Teens,” by John Lip-
pold, in your October issue, and then
witnessed the eentcr in action, I can
only say that the artiele does not do
justice to this activity. The center was
literally packed with young people.
Parent volunteers were being used
forty strong on the registration desk,
the check stand. snack bar, game room
and the dance floor. Everything moved
smoothly and it seemed the paid direc-
tor had very little to do. I was told
that this was a poor evening, although
over live hundred young people passed
through the door while l was there. I
know this activity makes a reat con-
tribution to the young people of Au-
rora. l feel it is one of the most sne-
eessful youth centers in my entire area.
The center, located in a downtown
building, is very well decorated. All
expenses are paid from the member-
ship fces, which should reach two
thousand this fall. The snack bar is
self-supporting. The center is a mar-
velous example of the ellcctivencss of
volunteer leadership, and the contribu-
tion of leadership given so willingly by
the parents helps to keep the overhead
to a minimum. It is really quite a
shining example of what an interested

RECREATION

community can do for its young people.
ROBERT L. HORNEY, NRA Field

Representative, Great Lakes District.

Ski Tow
Sirs:

We have read with interest Mr. Her-
dic’s article in the November issue,
“Skiing Need Not Be Expensive,” and
heartily agree that the addition of a
r0pe tow is an asset in any community
with suitable snow and slopes. How-
ever, we believe the article could well
have pointed out that some type of
safety device should be provided to
stop the engine in the event a rider be-
comes entangled in the rope.

There have been a number of serious
accidents and three deaths that we
know of, caused by a young skier’s
hair, scarf or clothing becoming twist-
ed in the rope and thus forcibly pulled
into the drive mechanism or head
sheave. Even on light portable tows
such as the one illustrated, it is risky
not to have a safety device, especially
where small children are using them.

The type of safety mechanism to use
depends primarily on whether the tow
drive is located at the top or bottom
of the s10pe. If at the top, it is an easy
matter to install a trip cord or safety
gate which causes a break in the igni-
tion circuit when pushed by a tow
rider. For high speed tows the cord
or gate should be located 30 to 60 feet
from the end of the tow line so that the
r0pe will come to a stop before an en-
tangled skier would reach the drive
wheel or head sheave. \Vhen the drive
machinery is located at the bottom of
the slope, an electric circuit which usu-
ally requires a relay is necessary. A
mechanical shut-off which is activated
by a single wire extending from the
engine to the upper end of the tow will
work satisfactorily on short tows. In
general, with a light portable tow it is
better to have the motor at the top of
the slope, because the eHiciency is
greater and the safety gate is easier to
install.

Safety devices cost just a few dollars
and may well prevent an accident.
Many insurance companies will not is-
sue liability insurance on ski tows un-
less they are equipped with such a de-
vice. We might also mention here that
any town or private party operating
such a tow would be well advised to
carry liability insurance.

At the 234 winter sports areas in the
national forests, all r0pe tow operators
are required to have suitable safety de-
vices and in addition liability insurance
in the interest of public safety.

The New Record

We have turned to a blank page in
the notebook; it awaits the record of
the coming year, and we once again are
struck with the fact that what will be
inwrtcd therein will be largely up to
us. It is a great rcSponsibility; and
we plunge, therefore, into reflection
upon our philosophy of life, and of
recreation, and search for ways of
strengthening both—conscious of the
mantle of service that falls upon the
shoulders of men in jobs such as yours
and mine. And we dedicate ourselves
once again to a course of action which
will bring about “the greatest good for
the greatest number of people.”

We review and evaluate, we house-
clcau, we plan ways of strengthening
ourselves and our work. This issue
of RECREATION, therefore, has been
planned to help you to clarify your
thinking and make new plans, and to
get on with the business at band—as
have the issues before it. To this pur-
pose will the issues of the coming year
be dedicated.

Don’t miss the editorial, taken from
the stimulating address of Bishop
liayne, in Seattle, on “The Spiritual
Aspects of Recreation,” or Dr. Ander-
son's inspirational talk on “Recreation
and the llicller Life.” Study the New
Year’s resolutions and other articles.

We suggest, too, that you may want
to add the following resolutions to
your own personal list.

I Resolve:

I. To extend beyond local boun-
daries, my service in the field of rec-
rcation, by thinking of my program,

or administration, in terms of ideas
that might be valuable to others, in the
pages of RECREATION.

2. To contribute the above ideas and
information to RECREATION; and to
bear in mind that my cooperation is
especially needed to make the follow-
ing pages helpful, lively and up-to-
date: Letters to the Editor, Recreation
News, Suggestion Box, On the Campus.

3. To send the magazine any good
photographs which seem to me to tell
a story, or to be possibilities for a
cover picture, and to make a note of
the fact that good pictures are especi-
ally needed of the following: play-
grounds and playground activities,
community centers and their activities,
winter sports, art projects, erafts proj-
ects, dramatic and musical activities.

The editorial staff of RECREATION
extends the season’s greetings to all.
with the sincere hope that we may work
more closely together in the New Year.

to hear a recreation director adi,
“What can we do for girls in the
recreation program? I don’t know
anything about them.” Too often his
program is offering them only a
warmed-over version of activities that
please the boys. Are you one of these
directors? Or are you satisfied that
you are presenting a well-rounded,
well-balanced program in your com-
munity? If you belong in the fomier
category, are you going to take steps
to strengthen your leadership this
year?

Have you interpreted to local citizens
why such leadership is advisable, and
why it would be a good investment?
Says llclen Dauncey, the Katherine F.
Barker Memorial Secretary who is in
charge of work with women and girls
for the National Recreation Associa-
tion, “While all leadership is important,
that of working with girls is doubly so
-——for the things we teach can be so
far-reaching. Mothers who have bad a
happy childhood and have learned the
essential ways of creating a good life
will want to do the same for their
children. Family solidarity and hap-

Industrial Recreation
Industrially recreation has high cash value. Frederick

W. Taylor in his marvelous work through administrative
efficiency demonstrated scientifically that an unskilled la-
borer could load upon a platform freight car 47 tons of
92-pound pigs of iron easier than he could 12 tons per day
if he rested half the time in carrying each pig. If he car-
ried half-pigs (46 pounds) he needed to rest only one-
quarter the time. Every size piece of iron has its scien-
tific demand for rest—so industrially, everywhere, in every
way, recreation is indispensable for efficiency.

Leadership
Most of all does the playroom need a play leader——pre-

ferably a kindergartner—who can sympathize with and
understand each play impulse as it hlindly gr0pes its way
to conscious and purposeful play. This kindergartner must
have freed herself from a slavish devotion to materials.
She must see that the real toys and materials are found in
the tissue hungers of the child’s developing body and mind.

Joy of Play

Swinging and sliding are not alone for physical coordi-
nation. There is a Spiritual joy in swinging, an exhilaration,
a push of imagination which sets free the child’s thoughts
and feelings.

Quotes on Executives
“There are two kinds of executives,” says Dean Briggs,

of Radcliffe, “the one who stimulates and the one who ac-
complishes.” He quotes the lady who said of Edward Ever-
ett Hale: “I know he doesn’t finish much, but he has cut
and basted more things than anyhody living.”

Adults and Recreation
We as people do not play enough. We loaf too much,

and work too much, but of real play of the energy-pro-
ducing kind there is dearth. We get dyspeptic and anemic
and nervous from lack of exercise, and despondent from
brooding over things that we ought to throw off in recur-
ring periods of joyous play. When we have a holiday
many of us find our way to the saloon or some worse place,
because we do not know what to do with our leisure.

JANUARY 1953

Voices from 1952

Industrial Recreation
“It was a fine show, and I’ve seen a lot of them,” stated

A. F. Logan, vice president—industrial relations of Boeing
Airplane Company, after viewing the employee-initiated
hobby show in the company’s huge sixteen hundred-seat
cafeteria. It was witnessed by 27,652 employees, their fam-
ilies and friends during its fiveoday run. Entries ranged
from a f0rty-eight-foot-wingspread sailplane, that an em-
ployee flew as a hobby, to a crocheted table cloth entirely

made by an employee while riding to and from work on
a bus.

Leadership
If a child has not been given the Opportunity to experi-

ment with some new things in crafts, drama, music, story-
telling, being in a tournament, serving on a committee,
helping to plan events and feeling responsibility for the
success of his playground—then the summer program has
failed him. If leaders have not learned to know which
children need help in making an individual, as well as a

group success—they have failed in their most important
responsibility.

Joy of Play

Although play activities must never be regimented, they
should be guided, so that each child is helped to develop
physically, to change social attitudes, and to grow in emo-
tional control.

Quotes on Exeeutives
I don’t think any of our leaders in the field should be

representing our great movement who have not read L. P.
Jacks or Joseph Lee, and many others. No other leading
profession would place their stamp of approval on such
ignorance of their background. I’ll grant you, we are a
leadership of doers, but we must have some dreamers and
thinkers to give reason for our many activities.

Adults and Recreation
The salt has lost its savor if what we do in the name of

recreation is any criterion. We are a nation of spectators,
not participants. We don’t play; we sit and watch while
others play. We are squatters, not players. Why don’t we
stand on our own feet and cast about for something better—
something that we can make with our own hands, out of
the design of our own hearts and minds? (Any comments

on theseP—Ed.)

Quotes from RECREATION ‘ 451

THE PLACE 0F 0RGANIZED CAMPING

THE ORGANIZED camping movement in America and the

state park movement have grown up together. They
started at nearly the same time and, in part at least, for the
same reasons. They have increasingly tried to serve some
of the same needs of people—the need to get away from
the city, to re-establish a eonnection with nature, and to
find the healing that comes from association with natural
beauty. In recent years state parks have been called upon
to play a large part in the camping movement through pro-
viding faeilitics and services of various kinds to camping
organizations; and there are reasons for believing that in
the years to come the state parks will he called upon to
play an even larger role.

Today fewer than 10 per cent of the children of camp
age in America have a camp experience, yet it is expected
that eventually a majority of the children may be given
sueh an expcrienee. There will accordingly be a great ex-
pansion in the eamping programs of existing youth agencies,
private camps, ehurch camps, and other groups now earry-
ing the major responsibility for camping. Camping has
eome to be regarded as an important educational experienee
for children, and the recent growth of interest in school
eamping gives promise that some day this may become a
major aspect of camping in America.

Today more than 60 per cent of the American population
live in eities of 2.500 population or over. Fewer and fewer
people are needed on our farms while more and more are
used in industry. It has accordingly hecmne more diflieult
for many of our people to attain access to the out-of-doors.
The organized camp has stepped in to help fill the need for
outdoor experienees iu the lives of children.

The organized camping movement had its beginnings in
the 1860's: at about the same time the first state park was
set aside. The Gunnery School at Washington, Connecticut,

in 1861 started what is generally considered to be the first
organized eamp, with a pattern similar to that of the or-
ganized camp as we know it today. However, camping in
its elemental sense is as old as the human race. To the
American pioneer and the American Indian it was a way of
life. The ability to care for oneself in the woods, to use
an ax, to hunt and fish, to cook a meal outdoors, and to
prepare a shelter was the mark of the self-sufficient man.

VALUES OF A CAMP. The good eamp makes important
contributions to the life of the camper. Beeause children in
camp life in small groups with a counselor, whom they gen-
erally love and respeet, partieipate in a program of aetivi-
ties related to the out-of-doors, and consider their aetivities
as fun and adventure, the camp is an almost ideal educa-
tional experience. Many of the values of a good camp relate
very closely to those in which state parks are interested.

The development of an appreciation of the out-of-doors
and the learning of skills in outdoor living are among the
primary purposes of camps. These involve developing a
friendly familiarity with the world of nature; an increased
understanding of the heritage that has come to us from
pioneer, explorer, and Indian; a knowledge of man’s de-
pendence upon natural resources and the need for their
conservation; the wise and proper use of outdoor areas;
and skill in caring for oneself in thc out-of-doors.

Another purpose of camping has to do with education for
safe and healthful living. The good camp is concerned not
only with making the camp itself safe and healthful but
also with dcvel0ping habits and providing knowledge that
eontribute to physical and mental well-being. Since camps
provide opportunities for caring for eabins and camp
grounds. for planning and preparing meals, for setting up
balanced living schedules, and for practicing good personal
health habits, they make a contribution to health.

The opportunities eamps afford for group living can con-
tribute to the development of democratie attitudes. A child
learns democratic action only by practieing it: and the

good calnp makes such practice possible. Living in small
groups gives the opportunity.

The good camp also provides many opportunities for
personal growth, encouraging the camper to develop self-
restraint, initiative, leadership, and intelligcnt disciple-
ship. It gives the camper the chance to learn new skills and
devclop new interests, particularly those arising out of the
outdoor situation.

The camp program is based on the natural desire of chil-
dren for fun and adventure. Calnp should be a happy ex-
perience. It is because camp life makes such a strong ap-
peal to childrcn that its opportunities to makc constructive
contributions to personal development are great.

Thc camp also has a responsibility in the field of spiritual
growth. Opportunities to develop a sense of appreciation

IANUARY 1053

for the bigness, beauty, order, and complexity of the world
of nature abound on every hand. The close relationship of
the camp counselor to the camper makes possible also the
development of a respect for personality and the finer as-
pects of human relationships.

TYPES OF STATE PARK AID T0 CAMPS. It will be

observed from the above statement of values how consistent
many of them are with the purposes of state parks, and how
much in common there is to be found in the ideals of the
two movements.

State parks have made their most important contri-
butions to camping by providing areas and facilities for
camp groups, which might not otherwise be able to afford

‘them, and by giving assistance to camp programs, particu-

larly in the field of the better understanding of the outdoor
environment.

Probably the first extensive development of group camp-
ing on state park property was that of the Palisades Inter-
state Park of New York and New Jersey. In 1901 acquisi-
tion of lands began, and group camping was “permitted.”
Probably non-permanent tent camps were used close to the
Hudson River. By 1913, more permanent types of camp de-
velopments were under way, especially on the part of the
Boy Scouts at Highland Lake and Lake Stahahe. By 1915
it was estimated that 5,000 campers used the parks, and a
building program was well under way.

In 1917 a separate camping department was established
and construction was standardized in units of suitable size.
Rentals were set to assist desirable organizations in locat-
ing in the park and to provide for making the service self-
sustaining.

As reported in 1947, there were seventy-three camps in
the park with a total attendance of 57,811 campers, most
of whom came from New York City and represented a wide
variety of organizations—youth agencies, settlement houses,
church groups, handicapped childrcn’s groups, and so on.
The above figures do not include the tremendous numbers
of hiking and outing groups that used the park.

Another development in the Palisades was the service in
nature education offered to camp groups. In 1927, through
a grant of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund,
a trailside museum, a craft shop, and nature trails were
developed in cooperation with the American Museum of
Natural History. The services of the central trailside mu-
seum wcre extended to the camps in the form of small
trailside museums, and nature trails were established.

Organized camping in other state parks did not develop
on any extensive basis until the 1920’s and the 1930’s.
Camping organizations used the parks first for overnight
and other short-term camps and then began to develop more
permanent facilities. During the dcpression the develop-
ments were accelerated by the use of emergency funds and
labor. By the end of 1950 there were 296 organized camp-
ing facilities reported in state parks, with a total capa-
city of 32,456 campers. These camps are generally rented
to youth organizations, church groups, schools and recrea-
tion departments which come in with their own staffs and
opcrate the camps. Moderate rental fees make these camps

453

the most economical approach to camping possible for
small organizations which camp for only a few weeks eaeh
year. During the year of 1950 there were 1,479,889 camper
days of organized camping reported in the state parks of
the United States.

Several state park systems have on their staffs camp spe-
cialists whosc responsibilities include develoPing camps,
granting permits, determining standards for park use, and
maintaining cooperative relationships with other state agen-
cies interested in eam ping. These camp specialists have as-
sisted in the training of camp staffs and have worked closely
with other groups to improve camping practices.

A third service to camping by state parks has been in
the educational field. Park naturalists and other park per-
sonnel have assisted camps in the parks, particularly in the
fields of nature and outdoor living skills.

AREAS AND FACILITIES. Many types of camp facili-

ties are to be found in state parks at the present time. One
park superintendent made the comment, “Our facilities are
a lesson in what not to do when the camp facilities are
rebuilt.”

It has become an axiom in camping that the program
should determine the facilities rather than that the facilities
should determine the program. Trends in camping should
therefore be studied carefully before new facilities are eon-
structed.

The trend toward decentralized camping, with smaller
living units, is extremely important. The greatest values
in eamp seem to come from the close relationships of small
groups rather than from mass programs. Therefore, facili~
ties should be so planned as to make possible the small-
group living situation. Many camp people feel that any
large camp should be broken down into groups of not
more than thirty-two campers, while others advocate the
small camp idea, with only eight or ten in a living group.
Some of the national agencies are advoeating “troop camp-
ing," which involves small grOUps going out by themselves.

A second trend is in the direction of what is often re-
ferred to as “real camping,” in which some responsibility
for food, shelter, and personal care falls upon the camper
himself and in which the program is centered mainly around
the out-of-doors and outdoor living skills. This generally
calls for very simple facilities.

The health and safety of campers makes imperative a
safe water supply, adequate sanitary provisions, elimina-
tion of natural hazards, and the like. Awareness of these
needs is a growing concern.

One of the tnost significant advances in the facility field
was the development by the National Park Serviee dur-
ing depression days of the group camps in the Recreation
Demonstration Areas. When the National Park Service was
designated to deveIOp areas for park and recreation pur-
poses, near large centers of population, it brought together
many of the outstanding eamp leaders of the country to
discuss the kind of facilities that should go into those areas.
It was understood that the eamp facilities were primarin
to serve non-profit organizations which were trying to pro-
vide eamping at a mininnnn of cost. Thirty-seven llecrea-

1:1.

tion Demonstration Areas were developed during the 1930’s,
thirty-four of which contained group camps. Although they
differed from one another, there was a common pattern
which has proven in subsequent use to be fundamentally
sound. The cost of duplicating these facilities today, how-
ever, probably precludes any current, similar wide-spread
development.

The following is the general pattern for these camps.
Living quarters were divided into four or five units, gener-
ally placed far enough apart so that they could funetion
independently. Each unit accommodated twenty to twenty-
four campers and four to six counselors. Generally, indi-
vidual cabins were set up to accommodate four campers
each. Counselors lived in separate quarters. Each unit
also had its own wash house and usually a lodge with space

 

The trend, which is referred to as “real camping," is that
in which some of the responsibilin falls upon the camper.

for fireplace eooking under a porch-like shelter. The facili-
ties generally included to serve the total eamp were: ad-
ministration building; dining lodge; staff quarters; help’s
quarters; garage; infirmary; central washhouse and laun-
dry, including showers; nature and craft shOp; swimming
facilities, either a lake or pool; and a council ring.

The Recreation Demonstration Areas have now. with one
exeeption. been turned over to the states and are for the
most part administered by the state park systems. The
publication. Organised Camp Facilities f reproduced from
I’arI: and Recreation Structures), which is available from
the. National Park Service, Department of’the lnterior,
Washington, I). C., is largely a description of the llccrea-
lion Demonstration Areas and is one of the best sourees on
camp faeilities.

In planning facilities to meet the needs of camp groups
several types of needs should be kept in mind.

1. Provision for organized camp groups of ninety to a
hundred campers. The youth organizations that use sueh
camps usually need faeilities only during the summer
months and on oecasional week-ends in the spring and fall.
Considering the growing school camp movement and the
resulting demand for camp facilities during the sehool year,
it is wise to winterize a large number of youth eamps. Ex-
cept for use during the coldest season of the year, double-

chm‘rrmx

wall construction of living quarters and simple wood-stove
heating are perfectly satisfactory. For winter living it is
more economical to provide large living quarters to accom-
modate six, eight, or ten campers instead of only four.
Cabins with wings or separate rooms are more desirable
than large dormitory-style buildings. Essential facilities
include sleeping quarters, dining hall, infirmary, washhouse,
laundry, lodge, and activity building (the last two may be
combined into one). Administration and staff headquar-
ters are also desirable.

2. Provision for small groups of thirty or forty campers
on a short-term summer basis. Tents may be used instead
of cabins. Much of the cooking may be done by the camp-
ers either in small buildings which combine dining halls
and lodges or out-of-doors in small sheltered kitchens. A
washhouse with showers is essential, and pit latrines may
be provided near the living units. Use of such facilities is
intended largely for short terms, generally one or two
weeks, by each group.

3. Primitive type of camp. The only permanent facilities
in this type of camp may he a washhouse and toilets. The
campers, in small groups of twelve to twenty-four, bring in
their own camp equipment and do their own cooking.

4. Provision for day camping. Day camping requires
very simple facilities. Shelter from rain, safe water, toilets,
and cooking facilities are all that are essential. If the day
camp groups can be divided into groups of eight to sixteen,
which have their own camp area, basic requirements are
met. The most desirable physical asset of the day camp is
an area rich in outdoor program possibilities.

CAMP STANDARDS. Several types of efforts to improve
camp practices, both in program and in health and safety,
are now under way. First, states have established regula-
tions, particularly in the field of health and safety, with
state boards of health and state welfare departments having
assumed the major responsibility.

Second, camp operators have developed standards. Each
of the major national youth agencies has set up standards
for its own camps which have raised the level of program,
leadership, and health and safety practices. The American
Camping Association at its 1948 national convention adopt-
ed a set of minimum standards and asked for voluntary
compliance on the part of its members. The standards of
the American Camping Association are concerned with the
following aspects of camping: program; personnel; camp
sites, facilities and equipment; administration; health; san-
itation; and safety. Although, up to the present, no method
of compulsory compliance with standards has been devel-
oped, the emphasis on improving practices has raised the
level of camping. COpies of thcsc standards may be secured
from the American Camping Association, 343 South Dear-
born Street, Chicago, Illinois.

A third means of improving camp practices has been
through education. Leadership training courses in colleges
and universities, short-term institutes, pre-camp training,
and various types of camping meetings and conferences
have all contributed to this end.

The state parks have had an important place in improving

in Indiana. Many types of camp facilities are to be found
in nearly all of the state parks at the present time.

practices. They have insisted on certain minimum standards
of administration, safety, and leadership on the part of or-
ganizations using thcir facilities. They have also helped
through the participation of their personnel in leadership
training programs and in workshops and conferences.

GROWING FIELDS 0F CAMPING. One of the rapidly
expanding fields in America today is that of outdoor educa-
tion and school camping. These include several types of out-
door experiences; but those with which state parks are chiefly
concerned are field trips, day camping, and resident camp-
ing. In Michigan, which has probably deveIOped school
camping further than any other state, the State Board of
Education has worked closely with the Department of Parks
in the development of the program, and park facilities have
been used by many school projects. Florida, too, is de-
veloping extensive park use on the part of the schools. In
other states, such as Indiana and New York, state park facil-
ities have been used to a limited extent hy the schools.

Municipal recreation departments are also making use
of state parks for day camp purposes. If state parks are
located fairly near large centers of p0pulati0n, they are well
adapted to use as day camps, with campers being brought
to the parks for the day and taken home to spend the night.
Day camping in America has been growing rapidly; and
schools, youth agencies, and municipal recreation depart-
ments are all concerned with finding proper areas for day
camp programs.

SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF CAMPING IN STATE
PARKS. The desire of camping organizations, schools, and
parents for expanded camp facilities and services in state
parks opens an Opportunity for service but also presents a
number of problems. There are differences of Opinion re-
garding these problems; and what follows is the personal
point of view of thc author after talking with many state park
leaders.

1. How far should state parks go in expanding camp
facilities and services? It is doubtful if organized camps
should be established at all in small parks. In large parks
it is desirable that camp facilities be established away from
the centers of other activities. In some cases, youth organi-

455

zations may be encouraged to secure property adjacent to
state parks for their camps, so that they use the park for
certain activities.

2. A state park system needs on its staff someone well
acquainted with camping who can assume reSponsibility for
camp developments and who can allocate their use. Such
a person should work closely with groups in the state inter-
ested in improving the quality of camping.

3. State park personnel can assist in leadership training
for camping. Education, in how to understand, enjoy, and
properly use the camp environment, might well be the major

{M1

 Q‘Lg

contribution of state park naturalists and other staff mem-
bers to the camp program.

4. One of the problems relative to camp facilities is that
of their proper allocation. Minnesota has worked out a
priority list for the granting of use of its camp facilities.
Highest priority is given to those groups serving physically
or financially handicapped children. Organizations finan-
cially able to do so should be encouraged to deveIOp their
own facilities, leaving the park facilities to groups finan-

cially unable to develop their own. Priority should also be
given to groups with sound programs which will make the
best educational and recreational use of the facilities.

5. Should state park camp facilities be completely main-
tained and developed from fees charged? This question
is debatable. A fee should be charged to care for the basic
maintenance costs, but organizations needing the facilities
most would be handicapped if the fee were high.

6. One of the trends in camping is in the direction of
more “real camping.” Several states have been experiment-
ing with the setting aside of special restricted areas in
which organized camp groups under leadership may carry
on limited programs using natural materials.

In conclusion it should be said that the demand for camp
facilities and services in state parks is at present much
greater than the ability of parks to meet the demand. The
camping movement is growing rapidly. and there is every
reason to believe that it will continue to do so. The increase
in camping by public agencies has a relationship to state
parks.

State parks have an important contribution to make in
helping to raise the standard of camping practice, in teach-
ing proper use of outdoor areas, in devel0ping an under-
standing and appreciation of the world of nature, and in
providing areas and facilities to groups which might not
otherwise be able to camp. These are kinds of services to
which. in my opinion, state parks are dedicated.

 

Adrian It. Massie Elected

Board
Chairman

New York
Trust [Jamaal-1y

 

Adrian M. Massie, who has been serving with distinc-
tion as treasurer and member of the Finance Committee of
the National Recreation Association for six years, and
whose active interest and participation in the association's
work goes back much further, has been elected board chair-
man and chief executive officer of the New York Trust Com-
pany, New York City.

It is appropriate that Mr. Massie should be heading one
of the most important banks in the Metropolis, for the first
love of his whole business career has been banking. A
graduate of Yale University, class of 19I9, he served for
two years in the firm of Davies, Thomas and Company,
then ten years with the Bank of America and two years with
the City Bank Farmers Trust Company, as an assistant vice-

456

president. His next step, in 1934, took him to the New
York Trust Company where he served as the vice-president
in charge of investments. In 19-15 he was elected a director
of the bank and, in 1949, executive vice-president, which
position he held until his present promotion.

Mr. Massie has always been interested in education. He
serves on the Board of Trustees at Columbia University.
and on the Board of Overseers at Sweet Briar College, and
for nine years was a member of the faculty of the Graduate
School of Banking at Rutgers University.

Another major interest of Mr. Massie is insurance. lie
is a director in the Bankers and Shippers Insurance Com-
pany, Commonwealth Insurance Company, Homeland In-
surance Company, Jersey Insurance Company, Mercantile
Insurance Company and Pacific Fire Insurance Company.
He is also a member of the United States Board of the North
British and Mercantile Insurance Company. IIis industrial
directorships include Webb and Knapp, Incorporated, and
the Rotary Electrical Steel Company.

A resident of Rye. New York, Mr. Massie serves the
neighboring community of I’ortchester as vice-president
and chairman of the Endowment Fund Committee of the
United Hospital of l’ortchcster.

The fricnds and admirers of Adrian M. Massie—a world-
wide circle of them—including many who are familiar with
his outstanding services to the National Recreation Asso-
ciation, are gratified over the New York Trust Company’s
splendid and well deserved recognition of Mr. Massie's
leadership in the field of banking and finance.

is but a few miles outside of the eity and

T HE NOTION that New Yorkers, to a man, spend their

winter week ends walking in Times Square, standing
at cocktail parties, or sitting in night clubs, is false. Just
scratch one of them and more than likely you’ll find a coun~
try boy, or girl, whose heart is in the highlands—especially
when the snow is right.

If this weren’t true, would the New York newspapers
print reports on snow conditions from November through
March? Would one of the city’s biggest department stores,
Macy’s, hire a lot of personable clerks to stand beneath a
brilliantly-lit ski map and answer questions on where the
skiing is best? Would Grand Central Station bend over
backwards to provide information twenty~four hours a day
during the season?

New Yorkers are skiers, all right. Of the four hun-
dred or so registered ski clubs in the United States, forty-
iive have their headquarters right in Manhattan. And the
retail business in skis, waxes and the proper clothes is
enormous.

There is the celebrated case of the big blizzard of Decem-
ber, 1947, when the snow fell two and a half feet deep in
the city streets and brought commerce practically to a halt.
The event precipitated a civic holiday, part of which was
a rash of skiing parties. People by the hundreds went skiing
up Fifth Avenue and Broadway, thumbing their noses at
the stalled buses and cars. Nobody had suspected before
that there were so many pairs of skis stowed in apartment
closets.

New Yorkers don’t wait for the once~in~a~blue~1noon
blizzard to do in-city skiing during the middle of the week,
however. There is a bit of a knoll in Central Park that
lends itself to practice of snowplows and stem turns when
a few inches of snow are on it. A hill of that size wouldn’t
look like more than an ant hill in the country, but in the
center of Manhattan, to the hordes of ski-hungry urbanites,
it looks like a minor Alp, and after a light snowfall some of
thc people who work in the vicinity bring their skis to work
and practice during lunch hour. And Van Courtlandt Park,

JANUARY 1953

is easily aecessible.

at the north end of the city, is practically Manhattan’s Sun

Valley for those who can’t leave town.
On the week end, of course, the Manhattan skiers really

get down to business. You see them trying to maneuver
their hickories in the subway at rush hour in order to get
to Grand Central for the trains going north. Even in the
weird hours of Saturday morning—at two, let us say—they
will be at the terminal in their ski pants, sweaters and clumsy
boots waiting to rattle off to upper New York or the New Eng
land states. And plenty of the north-bound automobiles on
Fridays and Saturdays have several pairs of skis on the
racks on top.

Skiers in the New York region probably have more
choice of places to go than their co~enthusiasts anywhere
else in the country. There are fifty skiing developments
within a radius of 150 milcs. New England has 275 lows and
in northern New England there are 1500 miles of specially
constructed ski trails.

These trails don’t offer the kind of skiing you get in the
Rockies, the long downhill runs on the open slopes. They
demand a different sort of technique, conditioned by the
narrow paths between trees and demanding sharp turns
and fancy corkscrew twists. But on the other hand, there
are certain comforts more easily come by in the East, such
as more fast lifts, J-bars, T~bars, a skimobile and aerial
tramways.

There is also a wealth of fun at almost every turn—
plenty of places along the trail to get something hot to
drink, square dances, sleigh rides and all manner of lodges
where people can dry their mittens and socks and just
sit around.

Naturally, there are many New Yorkers who think the
wcekend trek up-country is a bore, or foolishness, or both.
But the skiers aren’t on thc defensive. They get back on
Monday morning feeling like a million bucks and wait for
Friday again. And every Friday there are more of them.

RECREATION and the Richer Life

ONE CAN hardly pick up the paper today without being
very distressed at some of the reading. Here I have a cut-
ting from one of our own papers with a large type head-
ing, “American Democracy Held to be in a State of Hot.”
Now that might be jaundiced thinking, but after all it
wasn’t made by any Tom, Dick or Harry. It was made by a
gentleman named Dr. Richard l’ostom, Community Con-
sultant, Bureau of Community Development, University of
Washington, in an address to a group of welfare workers.
Much that he says will bear thinking upon. He said, “The
decline of local community vitality is sapping the life
strength from our democratic heritage.” And again, “Pri-
vatc business is beginning to realize that a hundred million
dollars in advertising the free enterprise system is not worth
a thin dime itself.” Thirdly, “All professions which deal
with social and community problems must recognize that
problems are not something separate from the community
—but part of it.”

Another article from the Tacoma News Tribune is headed
the “Age of Squat and Look.” It says, “Trade your piano
as a down payment on a television set. Try to tell a boy
and girl about the delights of a tafIy pull and you'll he
looked at as though you were slightly queer. Co on to tell
him what fun you had on long walks through the country-
side, and he'll know you are nuts.”

I am a little bit afraid that all of this is not wrong, and
while we like to speak rather scathineg of some of the old
days with those old, now out-lnodcd, virtues; perhaps all
isn't just as well with the world today as it might be.

l think I would put it this way. liven if these things are
not true, perhaps the worst feature. that has crept through
our North American civilization today is a toleration of
evil. We don't shudder at evil as we did many years ago.

Dn. ANDEHSON, a teacher [or many years, am an organizing
director 0/ Greater Victoria (ILCJ Recreation Council.

From 3 Talk by Dr. Henrietta A. R. Anderson
at the 34th National Recreation Congress

We are apt to be a little too tolerant. You see we are living
in what one might call a “so-what” age. “All right, they
did this or they did that; so what?” But it can be a very
dangerous policy. Another educationist speaking to me of
punctuality said, “He was late two or three times this
month; all right, so what! You know, Dr. Anderson, you
and I made a fetish of punctuality.” I am jolly glad that
I grew up in an age where we did. I still think it is a
mighty important thing.

I think maybe, when we threw overboard some of these
things, we were a little too hasty. You know the answer is
always somewhere in the middle. We speak of the “good
old days, when-—

“Thcre was no income tax, no cigarette tax, no road tax,
no sales tax, no luxury tax, no—tax.

“There was no old age pension, no health services, no so-
cial welfare; only the poorhouse.

“Girls of fourteen were strangers to lipstick and were
girls of fourteen.

“Crippled children remained crippled, the blind knew not
Braille, and orphans were strays of the storm.”

50 you see there are always the two sides, and the answer
is always somewhere in the middle.

But this toleration of evil is something we might think
a bit about. One man puts it this way. He said one of the
saddest features of modern Operating is the laek of the
woodshed and the absence of the hairbrush. There is some-
thing in that. We are at this crossroad.

We are also suffering to some extent from the welfare
state. Now, don't misunderstand me. Much in the welfare
state is good, but it also goes too far. . . .

Quoting another authority who must speak with some
conviction, Field Marshall Sir William Slim, Chief of liri-
tain's Imperial General Staff, said today, “The modern wel-
fare state may have lots of advantages, but it’s not good for
soldiers. The modern youth has not been taught to look

it

after himself—he never looks more than one hundred feet
across a city street or from the back seat of the cinema.
Therefore, he has to be taught when he comes into the army
to be a practical unit in himself, observant, able to look
after himself, and confident of his weapons.”

Now, what has this to do with recreation and the richer
or fuller life? Simply this: As long as we have these weak~
nesses, we aren’t living a really rich, full life. Unless we
are developing all facets of our personality, and are as-
suming some degree of responsibility, we are definitely not
living the richer, fuller life. In the field of recreation, to
that end, I would like to make one or two specific pleas.
Reverting to the press again, here we have Dr. A. S. Lamb,
an eminent gentleman associated with the Health League
of Canada, a Director of the Department of Physical Edu-
cation and Athletics at McGill University, Montreal, and
conceivably a person to whom it might be all right to listen.
He says, “Intensive competition, the desire to win and gate
receipts are masking our vision as to the more important
functions which sprout, and which recreation should serve.
It is our reSponsibility to see that the many thousands of
boys and girls who want to play for the love of it, have the
opportunity to do so. It is our obligation to see that par-
ticipation receives its proper emphasis, rather than passive
observation or spectatoritis. That would be sanity in sport.
The values of sport are no longer values unless they live

with us in all our relationships. The rules of the game are
the rules of life.”

I think that these things should make us stop and wonder
if we are handling this sports angle from a sane and sound
background. Are we placing proper emphasis? Are we
paying enough attention to hobbies? A gentleman well
known in Canada and not unknown in this country, J. B.
Priestly, said over the radio the other day that you can
take any little English village and you will find more hob-
bies in it than you will in the whole North American Con-
tincnt. That is very apt to be true. He said, “You know
that Napoleon said that we were a nation of shopkeepers,
we British, but we are not. We are a nation of hobbyists, a
nation of dog-fanciers, and bird catchers, and so on. . .”
I have a hunch, to use the slang expression, that is what
took the British through the blitz; their ability to enjoy
those simple things of life. The battles of Britain may have
been won on the playing fields of Eaton, but I am dead
sure the blitz wasn’t won there.

Another terribly important thing that we have to bring
back is this business of the sense of responsibility. You
know we are living in an age of handouts. It’s appalling
what is handed out to youngsters today. If they are not
able to stand on their own feet, that is the reason. That is
the reason for much of the vandalism in our parks. Peo-
ple don’t destroy what they build with their own hands or
pay for out of their own pockets. We have to get back to
the state where people did and made things for themselves,
appreciated them and took care of them.

We have a long way to go yet in the matter of community
spirit. Community centers are doing a wonderful job. but
we haven’t yet gotten to the bottom of the resources of thc

JANUARY 1953

community. The community is full of agencies that we
haven’t even used. The music teachers, the churches, the
service clubs we do use, but there are all sorts of groups
that we just haven’t begun to use at all.

Then, something sooner or later must be done about dis-
cipline. How are pe0ple going to grow up to discipline
themselves if they are not disciplined in youth?

I read somewhere recently that youth today is given over
to the three R’s. They used to be reading, writing and
’rithmetic. They say they are now rhythm, recreation and
refreshments. They are three good things; but I would
like to replace them with recreation, responsibility and re-
vival; a revival of all that is worthwhile in life, a continual
pointing of the young to those things.

What has all this to do with you individually as a rec-
reation director? Where do you! fit in, in the richer, fuller
life? Obviously, if you aren’t yourself enjoying a richer,
fuller life, you can’t pass it on to the children, can you-?
There are too few people today enjoying life. At supper
tonight, I said to somebody, “I wish there weren’t so many
people in the world today who obviously hate their jobs.”
That is pitiful.

I think that you must love people; you must really love
people—just like to work with them, put up with all their
little idiosyncrasies, look and see the best in them—of all
ages.

You must make a sensible budgeting of your time. It
isn’t at all to your credit to stand up and announce that
you are hurried from morning to night; that you have no
leisure; that you don’t even see your family. Now, that
isn’t creditable. It is just bad budgeting. You won’t stand
up, and you won’t be able to stand here when you are
as old as I am and boast about your health, because you
probably won’t be here. Do budget your time sensibly so
that you relieve the wear and tear, and don’t expend your-
self ruthlessly and needlessly because you only are lessen-
ing your value. You must somehow, if you haven’t already,
work round to a solid, philosophical base.

We have almost conquered matter. We have conquered
everything but ourselves. That is the one thing needful. We
still have that to do. It is a life job, it is part of our edu-
cation.

I am going to close with lines from a poem by Mr. Louis
Untermeyer, which have always seemed to me to be a de-
scription of the kind of person that a teacher or a recrea-
tion worker should be:

Ever insurgent let me be;

Make me more daring than devout;
From sleek contentment keep me free,
And fill me with a buoyant doubt.

Open my eyes to visions girt

With beauty, and with wonder lit——
But let me always see the dirt,
And all that spawn and die in it.

Open my ears to music; let

Me thrill with spring’s first flutes and drums—
But never let me dare forget

The bitter ballads of the slums.

From compromise and things half-done,
Keep me, with stern and stubborn pride;
And when, at last, the fight is won,

God, keep me still unsatisfied.

SPRAWLLVC OVER an eighty-mile diameter, bounded on
the north by mountains, on the south and west by
ocean, and cast by towns which in turn reach past Orange
groves to the desert, Los Angeles presents problems of, and
possibilities for, recreation not found in more compact
areas. In line with the growing tendency to use school
buildings and facilities for recreational purposes outside of
school hours. the idea developed in this community that
school buses also should not stand idle all summer but
should he used for the expansion of recreation horizons.
Their use for recreation purposes was therefore inaugu-
rated as part of the Youth Services program of the Los
Angelcs City Board of Education during the summer of
1917. A ruling was secnred from the county counsel to the
effect that. legally. hnscs could he used for recreation pro-
grams sponsored by the Los Augelcs City School District.
A lmdget for this [impose was approved by thc board of
education and four buses were assigned for the summer
months on an eXperimental hasis. l'iach bus was to he in
charge of an excursion dircetor assisted by adult volunteers
- -one for every ten children who went on the trip.
Trips were scheduled to the lreaCllcs and mountains. At

water under lifeguard supervision. and the Marine Museum
offers an opportunity for the study of marine life. Crab
hunting and fishing. as well as looking for shells. can add
to the day’s fun. Hardly a trip passed that a star fish or
other fish did not go with a child on the homeward journey.
On every trip [here was at least one child and often more
who had never seen the ocean although it is only twenty-
five miles from the Los Angelcs City Hall. One little girl
repeatedly went to the director with the words. "ls this
really and truly the Pacific Ocean?" As other bcach areas
were developed by Los Angeles City and Los Angelcs
County Park and liecrcutiou Departments. Zuma Beach on
Pacific Coast llighway and Alondra Park were added to
the itincrary.

Mountain destinations. on the other hand. offered a
varicty of scenery from a mountain hrook to pine trees
which grow ahove the 6.000 foot levcl. llere again it was
the first expericnce for many children and it was interesting
to watch their problem of adjustment—their anxieties to
not get too far from the hnses. their one familiar contact
with city life as they knew it. Their lack of understanding
and appreeiation of their surroundings. owing to the
strangeness of the situation. was evident on first trips.
llowevcr. a definite carry-over was noted in that it was
found children persuaded their parcnts to visit these same
recreational areas. Since the. Los Angeles City school
District is spread out over somc 750 square miles from

RECREATION

ocean to foothills, a definite effort was made to take the
children from the beach area to the mountains and the foot-

hill children to the beach.

One purpose of the trips is to acquaint children with
government parks and facilities which are available free
to the public. Emphasis is placed on the proper use and
care of these facilities. For example: “We do not cut cor-
ners on trails or roll rocks down mountains” or “We leave
picnic areas clean—no loose papers.”

A teacher-consultant in science and nature study prepared
an altitude guide of flora, complete with leaf specimens
which could be found at different altitudes along the bus
route, as well as of geological information. This material
was placed in the hands of the excursion directors as inter-
pretive aids to “what we see.”

Snow trips were particularly pOpular with our southland
children, since many Californians (even adults) have never
been in snow or experienced a snow storm. As one little
boy in his “thank you” letter expressed it, “We had snow
fights, we slid down the hill, we had fun and I wasn’t
ascaird a bit on the bus.” His reference to not being
“ascaird” on the bus is understandable when one thinks
how overwhelming the first experience of looking over the
edge of a winding mountain road down into canyons sev-
eral thousand feet deep can be to one who is accustomed to
flat areas. The vastness of one range peering above the
next, as far as the eye can see, is in itself an awesome sight.

During the early years of recreational trips, other groups
were the recipients of the gracious hospitality of the Quar-
termaster’s Relnount Station at the Kellogg Horse Farm
in Pomona. Laying aside their daily duties, the personnel
in charge waived the usual admission charge and put on
special shows for our children. One of these was given in
the driving rain. After months of drought, the heavens
suddenly opened, lctting forth a deluge reminiscent of the

School huses should not he i(lle during the summer. Their
use for recreation purposes began in 1947 as part of the
Youth Services program of Los Angeles City School District.

days of Noah’s Ark. So while the children sat snugly in
covered grandstands, the Shetland ponies skidded the
chariot wheels through flying mud, amid excited cheers,
and Arabian horses performed their acts. “We couldn’t
disappoint all those children,” said the major as he left the
field to change his muddy, soaked uniform.

There is a “Days of 49’ers” ghost town replica built on
the premises of the famous Knott’s Berry Farm. This too
has been visited, and the “Sheriff” had his liveliest day
since the town was built keeping the over-curious from
over-exploring interiors of wagons and other intriguing
attractions.

The Youth Services Section scheduled trips by school bus
to the Griffith Park Zoo and Planitarium, to concerts,
swimming and skating parties, and inter-school play days,
as part of the recreation program.

These trips have become so popular that the Los Angeles
City Recreation Department now leases school buses for
similar trips for the children attending the municipal play-
grounds. The use of school buses for recreational purposes
also has made possible the splendid day camping program
offered by the elementary division of Youth Services. One
hundred fifty-eight children a day from various sections of
greater Los Angeles are taken from school playgrounds to

Griffith Park where the day camp program is held.

The safety factor of transportation of children is of great
concern to the Los Angeles Board of Education and its
employees. Los Angeles school buses have had an enviable
record of accident-free trips. They have transported nearly
100,000 children since 1947, in Youth Services sponsored
programs, without a single injury enroute. This factor
alone gives parents a sense of security in permitting their
children to participate in school conducted activities. This
fine transportation record, coupled with excellent, alert
supervision and a challenging program, spells success for
this portion of the Youth Services program.

We planned sea coast destinations for those children who
had never seen the ocean and who could not believe that
this was the Pacific, although it is so close to their homes.

 

 

BECBEATHDN EXECUTIVE

) I an: a recreation executive. That’s what I am
called. And I have nobody but myself to blame for it. I
wanted to be a locomotive engineer or a cowboy but I
turned off the track somewhere, and here I am. So I
hereby resolve to make the best of it and have some fun.

Executive; execution; to execute. . . . I will not hang
the public, bchcad my board, eleetroeute the ideas of my
staff or kill the program through neglect. I will choose
another definition: to perform, to fulfill, to complete. I
will try also to learn the meaning of recreation and figure
out how these things should be blended. This will be,my
project for 1953.

Prior to becoming a recreation executive l was a human
being. I had a family, interests of my own, time to my-
self. privaey, and other good things long since forgotten.
I resolve that I will try to get some of them back. In my
spare moments I will practice .saying the word “no,”
gently, firmly, convincingly. l will taste some of the medi-
cine l have been dispensing so liberally and see how it
affects me. I shall try to become more a part of my fam-
ily. and not be pulled away from home and children.

I resolve to pretend, once in awhile, that I am a stranger
in my town and take a fresh look at its peeplc, its politics
and its prejudices. In those moments I will forget what
can't be done and why and remember the promise it once
held before I accepted the loeal facts of life.

If Disgruntled Taxpayer, Irate Mother, or Disappointed
should turn their attentions elsewhere, I will still remem-
ber that the community is made Up of individuals and
that my job is to cultivate and protect their individuality
during their leisure. This goes double for boys and girls
out at the military camp, and realizing that their trans-
planted roots eannot go down very deep in that soil, 1 will
help our community provide the rich warmth for which
they hunger.

462

I resolve not to trod the straight and narrow pathway of
self-interest and single-mindcdness. Instead I will explore
the broad highway of community cooperation. I will seek
out comrades in other agencies like my own and will wid-cn
my circle to include the workers for housing, education
and social welfare.

I intend to repaint the welcome sign and cordially invite
my staff and those with whom I work to come into my
confidence. I shall seek to return their calls. Together we
will share the pleasure of deciding where we are going,
after we have reflected on where we have been. Evaluation
will be a part of our regular order of business. Change
will be recognized as one of the constants.

l re-resolve to tighten up the loose nuts and bolts in my
own machinery. I will delegate responsibility, and not as
an Indian giver. I will tackle the hard unpleasant tasks
first. I will graft the thiek skin around the tender heart. I
will look up synonyms for those worn-out words in my
vocabulary. I will glance in the mirror to see if my mission
is showing too much.

Although I often may be caught performing the work
of a clerk, coach, plumber, maintenance man, praetieal
nurse, solieitor, reporter or bouncer, I know that my job
is a profession and I resolve to be more professional.
Aware that the world-wide recreation movement is made
up of many parts, of whieh my program is one. I will make
it contribute to the strength of the whole. Therefore, I
will dig those questionnaires out of the wastcbasket and
answer them conscientiously. I will get going on those
committee assignments. I will renew my memberships in
my professional and service organizations. I will partici-
pate in the conferences and workshOps and encourage my
stall and associates to do likewise. I will look out for
young recruits and encourage them to take the path I took.
Maybe it wasn't a wrong turn after all. It certainly has
been fun. I resolve to keep it that nay.

RECREATION PBOGRAM LEADER

) I am a recreation program leader, or at least I think
I am a leader, and I h0pe the programs are recreation.
Maybe with the New Year staring me in the face I had bet-
ter take a good close look. What kind of leader am I anyway?

I know that there are leaders and teachers who are re-
membered for yearS—favorably. I can even remember some
who treated me with courtesy and good humor and patience
and understanding. Am I one of these? I hereby resolve

I am a human being, and other people are also human
beings. Do I act like one and do I treat others as if they
were? Am I aware of children or members of my groups—
whatever age——as individuals? Do I know their interests,
their likes and dislikes, their wants and needs? Am I help-
ing them live their lives—and am I living my life? I
hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Have I become mechanical, perhaps even slipshod and
thoughtless, following blindly the Iines of least resistance?
Or do I still carefully plan programs which stand out, good
times that are so attractive that no one can resist them,
happy occasions which help establish new and exciting i11-
terests which carry over into the precious lives of those
who follow where I lead? I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Do I share my program planning, remembering that the
more a program calls Upon its participants for ideas,
planning and leadership, the more effective it becomes?

Do I work with children in a group rather than with a
group of children? There is a difference. I shall open my
eyes and ears and heart, so that I’ll never neglect the shy,
the rejected, the unruly. I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Do I keep lots of good new activity ideas and informa—
tion at my fingertips and strive constantly to brush-up my
own leadership techniques? Whenever possible, I shall take
advantage of any training Opportunities that come my way
and achieve real growth in my job. I’ll stop making the
excuse that I don’t have time to read. Good leadership
standards will be as familiar to me as my own right hand,
and will be used as much. I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Do I keep constantly in mind that, as long as I am a rec-

JANUARY 1953

reation leader I am a member of a profession? And do I
realize that one of the characteristics of my profession is
service to others? Am I keeping pace with the movement,
even if I have to buy a book or pamphlet out of my own
pocket once in a while and spend some of my own time at
a library digging out new material? I hereby resolve . . .

O I I O O O O

I have a boss who has some problems himself. He needs
my help as I need his—from time to time. Do I take respon-
sibility gladly for at least my share——and then do something
about it? Do I keep the boss well informed of deve10p-
ments so that he can answer unexpected questions? Do I
give the kind of c00peration up that I expect to get down?
I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Our program is judged, our entire agency is judged, by
what people see, whether they participate or not. Judging
is done at unexpected moments, not just when all is as—
sembled for inspection. And by and large people make
judgments on the basis of what they see other pe0ple
doing. Am I careful to help create as good an impression
of our program and agency as I can at all times, even when
I’m worn out? And do my telephone voice and my tele-
phone 1nanner help me out? I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

Hard as I work, and I admit it, I an] only one member
of a great team of recreation workers. There is more to do
than all of us can do right. Am I helping all I can to share
with other leaders what I have learned? And does my
pride let me learn a few things once in a while from them?
Am I taking the fullest advantage of every opportunity to
improve my skills? Am I watchful of the ways I spend my
working hours? Do I use as much care in budgeting my
time as I do my money? I hereby resolve . . . . . . . . . .

I am working at one of the important jobs of my genera-
tion. Play hours are priceless, not so much because they
are scarce as because they are so easily misspent. Man was
not made to work so much as he was made to live. I'have
an important place in living. And if I can, with help, keep
these resolutions I will have an even more important place.

CHLLECTING lllllllll’

One of the most natural habits of
. mankind and of many othcr living
things is the habit of collecting. The
small boy collects odd looking stones,
toads, snakes, and other things, gen-
erally to his mother’s dcspair. The
small girl collects dolls and trics to
hecomc a little mother. As thcy grow
older, their collecting habits change.
The stones takc a more selective form,
with somctimes an Indian arrowhead
added. The toad givcs way to a pair of
goldfish and the dolls are supplemented
by sewing and crochcting. Our collect-
ing hahits change many times during
thc carly ycars and, cxcept for that
period when “boy mects girl" and the
romance of the young adult overpowers
all other interests, there is always room
for some interesting pastime.

Where man differs from the ape is
in applying intelligence and usefulness.
The animal will collect anything that
attracts him. whcther it has any useful
purpose or not. The accumulation of
nuts and other food by squirrels is a
form of collecting, but it is primarily a
safeguard against a long winter. ln
the same fashion. man saves nioncy
against the time whcn he will need it.
If the money. that man saves, happens
to he Indian-head pennies. then eollect-
ing hecomes a hobhy.

A hobhy can he anything that a man
will do in his leisure time for relaxa-
tion or pleasure to take his mind off
the trials and trihulations of evcryday
life. This diversion can take several
forms—collecting. games. sports, crca-
live work, and others. At least one of
these forms is indulged in hy nearly
cveryonc at some period in his life. and

461

the form adopted depcnds on the phy-
sical and mental make-up of the person
involved.

Everyonc thinks that his own pet
hobhy is thc best and often belittles the
other fellow’s. The tcnnis player can’t
figure out why anyone would hit a
little white hall all around a lot of
acreage with a long stick. The hridge
fiend scorns the canasta addict. The
antique collector considers stamp col-
lecting a waste of time. This could go
on and on, but they all havc one thing
in common—-they are hohbyists. One
of the most pitiful sights is that of
someone without anything to do after
punching the time clock at fivc PM.
You may say that the movies, tcle-
vision, prize fights, baseball, and so on
answer this nced for something to do,
but you are wrong since these diver-
sions are mass entertainment in which
your participation is passive-amuse-
mcnt at no expcnsc to your brain and
energy.

Everyone should have a personal
hobby and it is not haphazardly that
doctors prescribe such a thing for the
overwrought, overworkcd, business
man. This might givc you thc idea
that thc carc and fceding of a hobby
horse is a rieh man's pastime. This is
far from the case. Yon may not be
able to afford thc collecting of eigh-
teenth-centnry porcelains, but you can
collect the various minerals in the
neighboring quarry.

Don't wait for the doctor to pre-
scrihe something for your nlcers, he-
lieve me. they arc not worth collecting.
When he tclls you to takc up a hobhy.
don't growl at the hill he sends. The

\Vm. Paul Bricker

pcacc of mind that you will attain by
paying attention to him is worth many
timcs'the fee for his advice.

Pick the hobby in which you can
become most interestcd. Also consider
others in the household. Don’t bc like
the man who took up fossil collecting
and absentmindcdly placcd an Indian
sknll on the bedroom dresscr without
first having warned his wife. He is now
collecting butterflies.

There are dcalers who cater cxclu-
sively to the desires of the particular
collector. Many worthwhile hohbics
have given rise to national organiza-
tions, and all of them have local clubs
where fellow enthusiasts can get to-
gether and compare notes.

To assist you in gctting a hobby
started in the right direction, with the
minimum amount of effort. 1 suggest
the following simple rulcs of procedure.

Selection of a llohhy

There arc many things to be taken
into considcration.

l. TEMPERAMENT. Some people re-
act primarily to hcauty and like to
havc beautiful things around thcm.
These collectors should go in for thc
accumulation of items that attract the
eye. such as porcelains, buttons. and
prints. Others prefcr a historical back-
ground and therefore should collect
things that show evolution. snch as
antique fnrniture. printing. and so on.
For thc mechanically inclined there arc
mechanical hanks. antiqnc antomohiles,
and clocks. For those who are awed by
the wondrous works of nature, there is
mincralogy and insect collecting. For
ear appeal. there is music and the col-

RECREATION

lecting of rare phonograph records.

2. SPACE AND LOCATION. Before
selecting a hobby it would-be well to
consider whether or not we can con-
tinue it, owing to certain limitations.
If you live in a small apartment you
are limited by space. You may want to
collect bulky things, but you would be
much wiser if you would stick to bob-
bies that lend themselves to a confined
area, such as stamps, coins, first edi-
tions, phonograph records, prints, and
so on. If you live in the country you
have room to spread out.

3. FINANCIAL. Cost can be very im-
portant. Everyone has a good idea
about what he can afford to spend on
a hobby. There are many hobbies that
require very little money to get started.

For every millionaire specialist, there
is a vast army of ordinary collectors,
like you and me, whose sole pleasure is
in accumulating the things we like, that
we can afford. When you start envying
the wealthy collector, you’d better start
anothcr hobby. It is the same as the
amateur and professional in sports.
The amateur loves his sport for the
pleasure he gets out of it, while the
professional is interested in the finan-
cial return involved. Of course there
are exceptions. Therefore a good rule
to follow in collecting is to be an ama-
teur at heart. Then if, in your quest,
you do happen to pick up a sleeper
(an object with no apparent value that
turns out to be valuable), you will ex-
perience great satisfaction.

After the Hobby is Selected

We have now come to the point
where, through careful thought, you
have made your selection. It is often
the case that the embryo collector will
become interested in more than one
hobby at the same time, which might
have a tendency to become confusing.
When such a thing occurs, follow the
line of least resistance. Accessability
and ease of obtaining additional speci-
mens is an important factor. Soon by
the process of elimination, you will
find yourself specializing in one line.
Many people have more than one hob-
hy, but usually one is well on the way
before another is started. Even in the
hobhy you finally select, it is possible
to specialize on a particular phase.

JANUARY 1953

There are two methods of learning
all about your hobby. First, by start-
ing your accumulation, and through
trial and error you learn about it. You
can then buy or borrow books on the
subject as you go along, or consult
with experts to increase your knowl-
edge. The other method is to read first
everything in sight about the subject
and govern your collecting accordingly.
Since I have followed both courses in
starting various collections, I find that
the first method is considerably more
interesting and educational and, when
the time comes to buy the more special-
ized books, you are more apt to under-
stand what thc writer is talking about.
Of course I do not include magazines
in this category as they are a “must”
right from the beginning.

There are certain orderly steps to be
taken:

1. Familiarize yourself with the eye
appeal of the subject. Visit museums,
browsc around shops that cater specifi-

section of the telephone book will list

have the same hobby and look over
their collections.

cally to your wants.

the

involved. Find out if there is a group
of fellow-enthusiasts in the neighhor-
hood who meet regularly for mutual
enjoyment and attend one of the meet-
ings. The dues of these organizations
are usually small in comparison to the
good obtained from them. These
groups occasionally have experts lec-

2. Investigate companionship

ture to them on the subject. Outings
are often arranged and periodically, in
conjunction with other clubs, an exhi-
bition is held which attracts wide pub-
lic interest. If you have attended one
of these you probably have noticed a
ribbon or award attached to a certain
entry. Only a hobhyist knows the
thrill of earning this distinction. If
for no other reason, the good fellowship

among

brother collectors is worth

everything.
3. Subscribe to magazines that spe-

cialize in your hobby. There are many
avocations that have periodicals de-

voted exclusively to them. Some maga-
zines have several classifications in the
same issue, but there is hardly a hobby
that (locsn’t have some regular pub-

lication for enthusiasts even though it
may be only the monthly report of a
society.

4. In order to conduct a hobby in-
telligently it must be done in an orderly
fashion. Some hobbies can need equip-
ment to help in the collecting. For ex-
ample, to collect minerals you need a
stone mason’s hammer and a sack to
carry your specimens, and for collect-
ing insects you need a net. However,
all hobbies require equipment for hous-
ing and study whether it is a shelf,
cabinet, or album. Naturally each in-
dividual hobby has its own particular
list of accessories.

There is nothing more to do now
except go ahead and collect to your
heart’s content. The possibilities are
many. For the studious there is re-
search in the many fine specialized
books on the subject and the excellent
collections in the museums. There is
also the possibility of turning your
hobby into a livelihood. During the
early part of the depression, I knew a
man who lost his job when his firm
collapsed. He had been a stamp col-
lector all of his life and had a very
fine collection, so much so that he
rented a “hole-in-the-wall” and became
a stamp dealer.

There ,is another case of a woman
who bought broken-down music boxes
and repaired them. She found out that
her hobby became profitable. Making
money out of your hobby is not to be
confused with putting money into it for
the purpose of having the finest collec-
tion in existence. Always remember
that no one has a complete collection of
anything, so get some fun out of it and
be an amateur. If you are able to make
some money out of it, all well and good,
but don’t make this your primary pur-
pose.

The nervous tension under which
most of us live has to be balanced by
an outside interest. The money spent
for phenobarbital can just as easily be
spent on some worthwhile pastime and
instead of relieving a case of nerves by
drugs, prevent them by taking up a
hobby. Don’t have butterflies in the
stomach—collect them.

AN excellent opportunity exists for the development of a
good grooming1 program in community centers and social
recreation agencies, where boys and girls meet in social
situations. In fact, good grooming has a definite place in
almost any agency program or setting where work with
young people is undertaken, such as, the 4-H Clubs, the Girl
Scouts, Y1“ and YWCA, the YW and YM HA, the Campfire
Girls, and the social settlement houses and neighborhood
centers.

During the 1952 programming season, the Teen-Age
Council of the Grand Street Settlement 3 planned and spon-
sored a good grooming and charm course for teen age girls.
Aside from being of immeasurable help to the fifteen girls
who attended the class regularly, the course also served as
a very positive influence in motivating better personal care,
hygiene and dress among the other members and club
groups in the settlement houm. Many members, including
staff workers, suddenly became good grooming conscious.

It was the writers’ good fortune to work closely with the
Teen-Age Council in planning the good grooming program.
The members of the Planning Committee of the council
readily agreed that the course, if it were to be effective,
would have to be made very interesting and colorful in
order to appeal to, and retain the attention of, the member-
ship. To that end, we planned each of the six sessions very
carefully and thoroughly, used a great deal of imagination
in publicizing the course, resorted to the use of colorful
visual aid materials and films, distributed freely a wide
variety of pamphlets, charts and fashion magazines, and
invited, as “outside” speakers, experts who were up to date

Some suggestlons, which grew out of our experience from

the course at Grand Street, plus some resource material

which we found to be most helpful, are summarized herein
for those group leaders who may be interested in setting
up similar good grooming programs for teen-agers in their
respective centers.

Some Guiding Principles

1. Individual and group photographs should be taken of
the class, preferably by the members of the center photog-
raphy club for before and after comparisons.

2. The local press should be invited to cover the course
and publicize it. At the same time, send out your own
publicity releases to the press.

3. Invite representatives from well known beauty salons
and schools of fashion to serve as guest speakers, demon-
strators and resource people.

4. From the very beginning, try to create a relaxed,
friendly atmosphere; arrange.the room informally with
appropriate charts and literature displayed for each session.

5. Present the classroom material in an impersonal man-
ner; try to avoid making any individual feel too self-
conscious. Members of the group seeking special help

Good photographs can
help in the promotion
of such a course. These
appeared in the New
York Daily News with
the following caption:
When seated, try to pre-
sent a picture of poise,
not an awkward, sloppy
posture, as at right.

 

Part II Social and party

(a) Friends and parents invited

(b) Photographs (Individual and group photographs

taken by the Photography Club of the center.)

(c) Social dancing and refreshments (Prepared and

served by the members of the class.)

The class would meet weekly for ninety-minute sessions
consisting of a thirty-minute informal presentation, fol-
lowed by approximately ten minutes of questions and dis-
cussion. A fivc-minute recess would follow, and thcn the
sccond part of the evening would begin wilh a thirty-
minute presentation, followed by another ten-minute ques-
tion and discussion period with group participation. The
session would end with a brief summary of the evening,
followed by some pertinent announcements regarding the
next meeting of the group.

should be handled through individual conferences or ap-
pointments.

6. As much as possible, demonstrate what you are talking
about and, whenever possible, use the students as par-
ticipants.

7. Include the membership in the planning and conduct
of the good grooming program, for only then are you
certain that your material will be geared to the needs and
interests of the group.

HUUSEKEEP‘ING

The first of a series
of badly needed

articles on this

subject.

 

0 When we work in a place, day after
day, we become accustomed to our sur-
roundings and often immune to many
of the things which, to the outsider,
immediately stamp our center as well-
kept and efficiently managed or untidy,
disorganized, and in the charge of a
careless housekeeper. The first time we
notice a small tear in the stage curtain,
a loose rung on a chair, a tilted lamp
shade, a dimly lighted hallway, or an
electric cord that is frayed, a mental
note registers “That must he fixed.”
However, with so many other duties to
be performed, many of these little “odd
jobs”-———the stitches in time—are by-
passed; and then gradually we look at
the faulty objects, and are so used to
seeing the defects, they no longer makc
an impression upon us.

Now is the time! Take an inSpection
tour of your center; and look at every-
thing anew—with the eyes of a visitor
seeing the place for the first time.
Carry a scratch pad and jot down every
little thing which needs attention. Keep
these notes handy where they will be a
constant reminder, and check off the
items as the required repairs and
changes are made.

Here is a basic list of things to watch
for; add other items which are perti-
nent to your own center.

1. Windows. Are they clean and clear,
washed regularly? Do any panes need
repair or replacement? Is there loose
putty which should be replaced before
more serious damage results? Do they
fit closely, open and close easily, lock
properly?

2. Curtains, drapes, shades. Do they
hang ncatly and correctly, hems all
the same distance from the floor, rods
inserted prOperly, gathers or plcats
cvcnly spaced? Are they clean and
well pressed? Would incxpensivc tint-

JANUARY 1953

ing or dyeing improve their appear-
ance? Are any minor repairs needed?
(Have you tried block-printing 011
plain colored drapes to rejuvenate
them; or using rows of tape or braid
to reinforce weak places; or applique-
ing designs to cover holes?)

3. Pictures, wall hangings, placques,
and other wall decorations. Are they
clean, have they been taken down and
thoroughly dusted recently? Are they
securely and safely fastened to the wall?
Are any repairs needed? Do they have
a purpose or contribute to the attrac-
tiveness of the room? Do they “be-
long” where they are? Are they prop-
erly placed—hang straight, right
height, well grouped? Is the subject
matter interesting or attractive? (If
you have monstrosities which are gath-
ering dust on your walls for no rhyme or
reason, why not remove them and re-
place them with fresh, decorative ones
-——a project for your art groups—or
murals, or the new scenic wall paper?)
4. Light fixtures, lamps, electrical out-
lets, switches, cords. Are outlets ade-
quate in number and conveniently lo-
cated? Are lamp cords out of the way
so they won’t be tripped over, stepped
on, or converted into a fire hazard be-
cause of undue wear or strain? Are
switches all in good working order?
Are light fixtures and lamps placed so
as to give adequate illumination
throughout the center? Are light bulbs
all serviceable and the proper size to
give maximum efficiency? Is metal on
fixtures polished? Are shades on
straight? Do they need washing, clean-
ing, repairing, re-trimming, replacing?
(Re-vamping the shades would make a
good club 01' craft group project.)

5. Furniture. ls upholstered furniture
clean and in good condition? Are there
soiled spots which should he removed

with cleaning fluid? Are there small
tears or holes which need mending?
Are there any pieces with Springs
which are loose or beginning to sag?
Are there pieces-which should be re-
moved from use until they can be fixed
so that the damage does not become ir-
reparable? Do leather pieces need sad-
dle soaping or other treatment to pre-
serve them? If slip covers are used,
do they fit neatly and well, are there
adequate fasteners and are they secure?
Would dyeing, recording, or trimming
them improve their appearance and
length of wear? Are pieces made of
wood or composition well polished? Are
the undersides of chairs and tables serv-
ing as parking places for old chewing
gum which should be removed? Are
chairs and tables sturdy and firm? Do
screws or bolts need tightening or re-
placing? Are there spots which are
slivered and need to be sanded, or
cracks and holes which should be filled
and refinished? (One of the older
boys’ cluhs or woodworking classes
could make many of the required re-
pairs.) Are the pieces arranged con-
veniently and attractively in the rooms
to give maximum usage and comfort?
6. Baseboards, moldings, window
ledges, and other woodwork. Are they
clean? Have all vestiges of old pafty
decorations (nails, thunibtacks, pins,
bits of paper, scotch tape, wires, string)
been completely removed? Are any
minor repairs needed—protruding nails
and screws driven in, missing ones re-
placed, loose pieces securely fastened,
hroken sections replaced? Are there
cracks or holes which need to be filled?
Does paint or varnish need re-touching?
(A minor repair now may save a costly
major repair later.)

to do something to keep the students

room problem was solved by shorten-
ing the luneh room period and the
skate project was dropped but not for-
gotten.

.\ few years ago roller skating was
again suggested as a reereation aetiv-
ity. Taking the leading role for the
students in the promotion of skating
parties was Martin H. Burns, Jr., of
Winnetka, a senior and head of the
Student lieereation Committee of the
Student Council.

Space presented no problem. New
Trier’s gymnasium floor is 90 feet by
134- feet, an ideal size for roller skat-
ing. There was, nevertheless, a problem
involved in the issuing and storing of
skates, because hew Trier has no
equipment room in connection with
the gymnasium. Sinee. the gym is often
used as an assembly hall, however,
there are built-in storage elosets for
«hairs; and it was deeided that these
would answer the problem. Although
the elosets were full of chairs. above
them and directly behind the double
doors there was sullieient spaee to in-

RECREATION

stall two especially built cabinets, each
holding one hundred pairs of skates.
Each has one hundred pigeonholes
five by five inches by fifteen inches
deep, in five horizontal rows of ten
pigeonholes each. Doors of the skate
cabinets are closed and locked when
not in use.

The next step was to arrange and
mark the skates by size so that they
could be issued efficiently and quickly.
Smaller skates were issued from one
cabinet, the larger skates from the
other. In each cabinet the skates were
arranged with smallest skates at one
end. Every pigeonhole was numbered,
and each skate was marked with the
number of the pigeonhole where it
belonged. In the beginning numbers
were stamped on, but this proved so
difficult and slow that a new plan
of using typewritten numbers under
scotch tape was elected. This method
works fairly well, but an even better
system is still being sought. Students
approach the skate cabinets in rela-
tively short and rapidly moving lines
rather than one long and unwieldy line.

At first, individual students did not
know what size skate they should have,
and obtaining skates was very slow.
To meet this dilemma, a quick and
simple system of finding their skate
sizes without individual fitting of skates
was devised. By using a flat, wooden
stick marked off according to sizes,
similar to those used at shoe stores,
students could determine their prOper
size. All skates are passed out by the
attendant in exchange for the student’s
activity ticket, which goes into the
pigeonhole where the skates were. The
procedure is reversed when the skates
are returned. For gymnasium classes,
where students arrive at the same mo-
ment, the skates are arranged on a
table, each size grouped together. A
student returns the skates to the same
place when he is through. There is no
difficulty in getting skates back into the
small pigeonhole if the skates are laid
on the table with the wheels together
and the heels together. Thc heels are
inserted first, the straps do not pro-
trude nor interfere with shutting the
cabinet door.

The students skate to records, the
most p0pular of which are waltzes and

organ 1nusic.* At the first Hallowe’en
Party over one thousand students par-
ticipated in the various activities pro-
vided. Of course, everyone could not
skate, but the majority could and did.

Thanks to its initial success, roller
skating has become much more than
just one of the activities at a gym-jam.
Sponsored by the New Trier Parents
Teachers Association with no charge to
the students, the gymnasium was
Opened to students every Saturday
afternoon for the Saturdays preced-
ing spring vacation. The attendance
was estimated from one hundred fifty
to three hundred skaters per session.

 

In addition, a local church used the
gymnasium for roller skating parties
for their young pe0ple’s society on

Sunday evenings. Since then many
other groups have followed suit.

The p0pularity of roller skating
made it a part of New Trier’s co-
recreational physical education classes.
During one week, all the boys’ physical
education classes roller skated. The
entire week before spring vacation
about one hundred fifty boys and girls
skated together every period.

Without doubt, the roller skating
program has been enthusiastically re-
ceived and participated in by nearly
100 per cent of the student body. Mr.
Gaffney has stated that it is one of the
best projects ever undertaken and inau-
gurated at New Trier.

One of the major reasons for roller
skating’s success here is the fact that
it was initiated and organized by the
student body. Whenever the gym-
nasiuln is used for skating, the students
themselves supervise the activity and
organize its promotion. It is the old
story of getting out of something just
what one puts into it. The students
have contributed much time, effort and
enthusiasm in building up their roller

for list of records for skating.

skating program. As a result, they re-
ceive a great deal of fun and whole-
some enjoyment from it.

Also on the positive side of the
ledger is the relatively low cost and
inexpensive maintenance needed for
this program activity. After the initial
investment in the purchase of the skates
and a few good dance records, there is
no added expenditure, providing un-
used gymnasium space is simply con-
verted to roller skating. It needs little
supervision. The only overhead in-
volved is the electricity used for the
lights and for the record player. In
addition to these encouraging factors
is the fact that roller skating can be-
come a possible source of income and
be completely self-supporting. A nom-
inal entrance fee can help to defray
costs and to provide a profit for the
purchase of new equipment.

Any activity which brings boys and
girls together, provides them with
laughter and fun, and also alleviates
the awkwardness so often encountered
between teen-agers when they try to
meet on a casual basis is bound to be
a success over-night!

As every parent and teacher knows,
the teen-ager usually has time on his
hands over the week-end. Girls and
boys often band together with the h0pe
of finding something to do. With roller
skating open to all, they can meet with-
out any difficulty, and the net result is
an evening of happiness for all con-
cerned. This activity meets the appro-
val of educators and recreation direc-
tors, who find it keeps youngsters off
the streets and provides them with a
healthful activity.

Dancing is always p0pular with the
average high school student, the roller
skating has the same underlying prin-
ciples of rhythm, coordination, and
music which both skaters and dancers

enjoy. Inhibitions and awkwardness
are forgotten.

It is an activity with unlimited and
unexplored possibilities; because of its
general appeal to all age groups, it can
be used not only by high schools, but
also by YMCA’s, YWCA’s, the Amer-
ican Legion, and other service organ-
izations, the recreation departments of
cities, junior chambers of commerce,
and many others.

PART II

Egypt

Recreation in Egypt, as we understand it, is in its early
stages and is carried on by four different ministeries of the
government. Two items stand out:

1. The very significant work being done in the villages
of Egypt which, according to a four-year study recently
completed by the Rockefeller Foundation and reported in
the New York Times, are the most unsanitary places to live
found in any part of the civilized world. The experiment
being carried on was the use of high school students to
devel0p social and recreation programs in the villages.
During the vacation period, boys and girls from sixteen to
nineteen years of age, after a period of training, go and
live in the villages, and there furnish leadership for games,
dramatics, handeraft, music and social work in the homes.

2. Outside the schools, in the cities, the recreation pro-
gram-is carried on hy a Department of Sports and Leisure
Time Activities. We talked with Amin Sadik, and later
spent the evening at one of his playgrounds where we saw
a demonstration which included a basketball game, wrest-
ling, tumbling, boxing and exercises. This playground is
located in a tobacco factory district where they work hard
and are very poor; and the boys and young men, according
to Sadik, “do not have to be here; they come from the
heart." This program started in 1941, with one play-
ground; there arc now seventeen. Those who attend be-
come members f there is no feel. It started with thirty
members. There are now twenty-five hundred. Sadik knows
them all, by sight or by name.

My tribute to him as I spoke to his group brought a
warm response, showing their admiration for his leader-
ship.

Jordan

Road blocks. barhed wire, bombed buildings. and sentries
along no man's land. reminded us that thc .lordan-lsraeli
problem is not yet settled. This. plus very large unemploy-
ment. and the presence of innumerable refugees—living on
relief in tents and eaves—made it easy to understand when
several different Arabs, Christian and Moslem. said to me:
“There is little or no recreation. The people are too sad
and hungry."

We saw several bare playing fields adjoining schools.
One soccer field was left by the British. but it is now
seldom used. The YMCA. in the midst of all this, is an
oasis directed by an Arab Christian. On an improvised
basketball court in the driveway. right under our window,
we watched a basketball game. A fine looking group of
young men—Arabs, Armenians, and others—were in the
game room listening to music, and in the evening watching
an American movie.

RECREATtON

T. E. Rivers

In front of the “Y”, an athletic field 75 by 300 feet, is
being constructed. At 5:30 A.M. I looked out the window
and saw Arabs crushing rock with hand tools, and donkeys
four feet high—with loads of dirt and crushed stone——
being hurried along by Arabs in red and white headpieces.

Labib Nasir’s eyes shone as be visualized what this addi-
tional facility would mean to his program. We talked
scveral hours about the needs of his peOple and what rec-
reation could do to help relieve the tension that is under-
mining the mental stability of this ancient land.

In addition to the limited supply of literature I had with
me, I gave him Joe Nygaard’s book in English and Arabic
on baseball and softball; probably the first c0py to be in
Jordan, as I had brought it from Egypt where it had just
been printed in Arabic.

One Arab told me he feared for Arabic youth, whose
idleness and frustration might lead them to welcome Com-
munism on the basis that anything would be better than
what they had.

Lebanon

From Jerusalem we flew over the Bicaa Plains—said to
be one of the richest soils on earthH-into Lebanon. Leb-
anon, unlike some of the other Near East countries is 85
per cent literate. The American University of Beirut and
the Beirut College for Women have had a real influence,
and there are sports, folk dancing, music and other recrea-
tion activities in the city; but, for the country as a whole,
the recreation program is in its infancy.

We had a two-hour conference with a staff of govern-
ment officials responsible for recreation. An attractive
young Arab woman from Palestine, who had studied in
England, was our interpreter. They questioned us eagerly
on theory and methods, told of their need for technical
assistance, and welcomcd the literature we brought.

In answer to a question, I summarized the recreation
development in America, and showed them the NRA year-
book. Wadik Haddad jumped to her feet and exclaimed:
“Oh, it sounds like heaven! When will it be like that
hcrc? We arc poor and there is little money.” She hesi-
tatcd a moment and then added, “But we also know that
where it is willed, a thing can be done.”

soil.

Pakistan

We flew across the Arabian sands to Karachi, the capitol
of Pakistan, five-year-old Moslem state set up on the parti-
tion of lndia. We arrived in a full-fledged monsoon, but
the meeting of leaders was held on schedule and we had
representation from the army, navy, air corps, boy scouts,
Ministry of Education, the local school system, and several
key laymen. For two hours we discussed recreation, their
problems, their resources, their leadership—or lack of it
primarily. Their questions dealt with immediate pressing
problems which were obvious 011 every hand in this new
struggling nation.

The Deputy Educational Advisor for Pakistan received
our recreation literature, told us a man had just been
appointed to head up physical education and recreation.
We also commended him on the selection of Miss Rachid, a
brilliant young Moslem woman who had visited our office
in New York just before 1 left, as a member of his staff.

In the American Embassy we discussed with Ray Lee,
our cultural attache, the recreational needs of Pakistan.
Mr. Lee, a six-foot Texan from Austin, said, “Mr. Rivers,
what this country needs is not buildings but a few Jim
Carrisons turned loose on them. Before you know it, you
would have recreation all over the place. He is a man
trained by the National Recreation School.” I replied,
“Yes, I know Jim. We trained him and three hundred
others.” That kind of training, the results of which Mr.
Lee had seen in Texas, was what hc felt was needed today
in sorely pressed Karachi—a city originally of a quarter-
million now swollen to one and a half million, filled with
refugees, many of whom are living in mud shacks in
hunger and frustration. '

Here is seed bed for revolution. Here also is fertile soil
for any program that will give a modicum of h0pe and
some assurance that the democratic world does care' for
human needs in whatever part of the world they arise.

India

On the other uide of the line lies India. Fonr hundred
million people—mow free and independent—conscious of
their need for technical leadership, short on food and water
and houses, but proud both of their new freedom and their
traditions and culture rooted in antiquity. They have set
about bravely to reconcile the two; and in our field of
recreation, this is coming about. l am happy that our NRA,
at this psychological moment, could have had a share in
that magnificent process.

as we understand it; but many agencies—public and pri-
vale—are related in one way or another to the recreation
life. of the pe0ple. There are organizations especially in-
terested in reviving traditional games, dances, and festi-
vals. I especially commended this.

ln addition to individual conferences and tours of rec-
reation facilities, there were four significant gatherings in
Delhi:

1. Our mission was honored at a reception attended by
a distinguished grOUp of lndian educators, and political
and social leaders. This helped to launch our week on a
high level.

2. At an evening meeting at Delhi College, a special dcm-
onstration was put on for us by children of the Bafkan-Ji-Ki-
Bari and the National Cultural Association. The programs,
beautifully staged, consisted of a chorus; an orchestra with
ancient instruments vgnitars. tanpura, jaf-laf-rang lbowls
uf water played by sticks), violins and a bamboo flute;
Indian dances- -one classical, one peasant; and a lovely
pantomine production of xiii Balm and the Forty Thieves.
\II the costumcs were made by the children from things
thM' had.

5. The next mening in a twoohour session we met with
about twentx five men carrying on rerreation programs in

arinus public and private agencies. We discussed their
problem-t, needs. possible solutions, and the important-.- of
liming a strong ventral private organization to push rm rca-
tion and serve Iotal operating agencies.

Lover native dancers, temples of gold, pagodas studded with
colored ceramics help to gise Bangkok its exotic character.

4. The fourth significant meeting was a small luncheon
given us by Dr. Sushilla Nayar, State Health Minister and
Director of Rehabilitation, a charming and able leader.
Here, with several ministers, including the Chief Minister
of Delhi State, we faced at this t0p government level what
might be done to help recreation leadership in India, and
together worked out essential steps.

We were surprised and delighted to learn that at Brila
Temple, where Hindu and Buddha religions are merged,
a play and recreation program is carried on. We visited
the Bhangi Colony, the village of untouchables; we stood
barefoot at the simple memorial to Gandhi and recalled the
part he played in leading India into her modcrn cra. We
felt the beauty of the T aj Mahal. We saw thousands of re-
fugces packed in tents and shacks.

As we left. a large group of Bari girls who had performed
for Us earlier in the week. and to whom we Spoke, came
to our hotel room and placed garlands of fresh flowers
about our necks and hade us farewell.

Thailand

ln Bangkok at the National Stadium, whcre Thailand's
college for training physical education and recrcation lead-
crs now has 350 students in their third year, we had a two-
hour session on recreation with the faculty, oflicials of the
department. and with representatives of various other agen-
rics, public and private.

We saw a demonstration of games and dances, old and

Rncnmnos

new. A hurried tour revealed small playgrounds here and
there; soccer fields, tennis courts, and very frequently a
small playground connected with the temples. One very
large, well-equipped playground was donated by a Chinese
industrialist.

We were in Thailand just long enough to realize how
facinating a place is Bangkok. The pe0ple were friendly,
efficient, and eager for ideas. They are independent and
their eyes are to the West. Recreation will help to keep
them there.

We arrived at the right moment, and the Thai leaders
were warm in their appreciation of the NRA literature we
brought, the help on specific problems, as well as the time
we had given to observing and commenting on the facilities
and discussing the relationship of the recreation program

to democracy.

Phi lippincs

In the Philippines we were in competition with a typhoon
but we were able to have several conferences and a meet-
ing, obtain some information and, I think, be of some help.

Some thirty-five years ago, Ellsworth Brown had intro-
duced softball, basketball and volleyball into the Phil-
ippines; and a foundation was laid that has formed an im-
portant part of the recreation and sports program of that
nation.

Perhaps the most significant development that came to
our attention, in its effect on the life of the Philippine peo-
ple for the future, was in the Ministry of Education. Sera-
fin Acquino, who attended the Boston Recreation Congress,
told of the definite concept of using the schools for both
the education and recreation life of the pe0ple. Last sum-
mer 1,796 teachers were brought to Manila for a six-weeks
training course in physical education, recreation, folk danc-
ing, music and games. They carried this program back to
their pupils and their communities. The department also
sends out institute teams of three people of different skills
to give in-service training for one week in folk dancing,
athletics and games. We were told that these teams have
covered forty-nine out of fifty-one provinces.

The schools are community centered. Children are given
projects that involve the parents. PTA’s are reported as
being active throughout the islands, and several examples

of their leadership were cited as community projects. The
Adult Education Division is encouraging the revival of
Philippine songs and folk dances. Here the American in-
fluence is strong.

Hong Kong

Hong Kong is a keg of dynamite. Two and a quarter mil-
lion to three million persons are crowded into a limited
space. I walked through one section reported to be the most
densely-pOpulated area in the world. The housing shortage
is acute; water is rationed; unemployment is serious. It is
reported to be honeycombed with communists. Tension
grips these people. Leaders are conscious that they are liv-
ing in one of the last outposts of freedom in that part of
the world. With this setting, to have some of Hong Kong’s
leading citizens publicly declare that, along with the urgent
needs being faced, the “need for parks and recreation is of
the utmost importance,” should make all of us who have
devoted our lives to recreation feel a glow of pride.

A Children’s Playground Association, organized twenty
years ago runs in high gear. It now operates nine play-
grounds, and is supported by voluntary contributions.

I talked to Colonel Clague, one of Hong Kong’s leading
businessmen, who has given outstanding leadership to Hong
Kong’s recreation program. Colonel Clague said, “The only
way we can get land is to remove a mountain or fill in
the sea. We are doing the latter.” He showed me plans for
a reclamation project which would make available a five
and a half-acre recreation area literally made from the sea.

The Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation, a Chinese
organization which has twelve thousand members, is put-
ting on a campaign right now to raise one million Hong
Kong dollars to complete a stadium. There are numerous
private sports clubs.

We left Hong Kong greatly stimulated by the fact that
here, in one of the most troubled spots of the world,
thoughtful leaders were giving time and attention to recre-
ation bccause of what it could mean to the human spirit
in times of stress.

Our most extended service was in Japan. On this we shall
report more fully in the February issue of RECREATION.

 

Location of
Social Centers

Preliminary to a referendum on Lighted Schools, the Chi-
cago Recreation Commission made a study of the needs of
communities for social centers. Its recommendations for
the location of social centers in the schools are:

1. Neighborhood Basis—Each neighborhood should re-
ccive some form of recreational service. Duplication of
services or the piling up of services in one community, at the

cost of services to others, is to be avoided.
2. Functional Basis—Each center should be housed in a

JANUARY 1953

facility which is functionally adaptable to the program to
be offered. For example, it is. impractical to use a room
with low ceiling for active games and sports.

3. Basis of Relative Social N eed—A higher priority is given
to those neighborhoods where social conditions present an
urgent need for a constructive youth program to offset nega-
tive influences. Areas of high population density, of poor
living standards, and similar conditions will be shown
higher priority.

4.. Basis of Community Support—Centers are recommended
only in those neighborhoods where it can be demonstrated
that there exists a high degree of local interest and support
for the program. Funds will not be wasted in areas where
people do not wish to be served.

The phenomenon that east the magie

New Zealand. in whieh two players tap

ehant. The syncopation ol the routines,
plus the unusual coordination required,
make it challenging activity for Inter-
mediate and Senior Seouts (and their
leaders). Once the girls learn how, it
is hard to stop them from playing it.

The one requisite for the game is a
pair of stieks for each player. The
ideal stieks are those that the girls find
in the woods and earve or paint in
their own designs. They should be
straight. one to one-and-a-half inches
in diameter and twelve to eighteen
inches long. and free from any rough

ean use rolled up newspapers. but these
are not satislaetory for long because
they do not make enough noise to em-
phasize the interesting rhythmic pat-
terns.

One movement of the sticks is made
for each heat of the ehant. There are
live hasie movements:

Clap: hit own stieks together. up-
right (Fig. 1).

Tap: hit tip ends of stieks on floor
one at eaeh side of player (Fig. 2).

Drum: hit stieks on floor heyond the
knee. holding them the way a drum-
mer hits a drumstiek (Fig. 3).

Flip: toss sticks in air, turning them
once. and eateh other end (Fig. 4) .

Throw: throw stick to partner with
an upward motion so that the stiek
drops into her hand easily. The stieks

are thrown gently in a vertical position
(Fig. 5).

Taps, claps, (lips, and drums are
done with both hands at the same time.
Both players do the same thing. Throws
are done with either the right (R) or
left (Ll hand. or as douhles (D) with
both hands.

Players kneel, sitting haek on their
heels. laeing each other, their knees
about a foot apart. In throwing stieks
to her partner. eaeh player must throw
her stick straight aeross. so that the
two stieks do not eollide in mid-air.
Thus in a right throw. player A would
throw straight aeross from her right.
and player 3 would throw straight
aeross from her own right (Fig 6). 0n

EDITOR’S NOTE

“Titi-Torea” is one of the songs the
Maori sing with their stick games. It
was taught at an international gather-
ing last summer at the Edith Macy
Training School by two New Zealand
trainers, Miss Joy Carter and Miss
Gwen Rankin.

Beginners at the game may start with
some familiar three-four tune, but all
players should also learn the beautiful
Maori song with its characteristic har-
niony. (In music A, the main tune is
carried by the lower notes and the har-
mony is indicated by the small notes

l JANUARY 1953

The Maori people of New Zea-
land are closely related to the
Hawaiians. They are tall, brown
and wavy-haired. The Maori
are noted for their intricate de-
signs and beautiful woodcarv-
ings. Gateways and meeting
houses may be elaborately
carved. The design at the left,
at the tap of the preceding page
was taken from, a stick made by

a Maori. Readers of Kon-Tiki,
by Thor Heyerdahl, will be in-
terested in knowing that the de-
sign at the right is the head of
a tihi, a charm worn around the
neck.

above. In music B and C, the top notes
carry the tune.)
Maori vowels are pronounced like
Latin vowels:
a as in father
e as in they
i as in machine
0 as in hope
u as in ruby.
W11 is pronounced as f—otherwise
the consonants are the same as ours.
The New Zealand Cuidcrs have also
given us the traditional opening of the
game. One player says “Timata” (tee-
mah-tah) and the players put sticks in
tap position. The other counts to four:

 

“Tahi, rua, toru, wha” (ta-hee, roo-ah,
to-roo, fah) as the players bring sitcks
up before them. Then the song and
game begin.

Miss Beverly Robbins, district direc-
tor in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, points
out the several program fields the stick
game may open up: “It is a game that
fits into the troop’s outdoor program
very nicely. Practice the game in the
meeting place. Then when you’re on
your next hike, cut your own sets of
four sticks each. The sticks should be
dried, sanded, and waxed or varnished.
and painted or possibly even carved in
original designs. (Carving or painting
should be done before waxing). A new
area of design and carving, and per-
haps other natural crafts, may be
opened up to the troop. The game may
also lead into campcraft skills and na-
ture when the girls are preparing to go
to the woods to cut their own sticks.
It may stimulate interest in singing
games, or be a jumping off point into
the international friendship field. These
are just a few of the program possi-
bilities.”

By the way: the stick game is some-
times called “lemmi sticks” among
United States Girl Scouts, but the term

was unknown to the New Zealand

trainers.

From Discussion Meeting, 34th National Recreation Congress

A Well-Rounded

Indoor Center Program

IN discussing the building of a well-rounded program
for indoor recreation centers, a group at the Seattle Con-
gress favored the following ideas:

1. The community center should serve all age levels and
all groups with a broad program covering many interests.

2. There should be sound planning and COOperation with
the school and such school-community groups as the PTA.

3. There should be planning and cooperation with com-
1nunity youth serving agencies and a policy established for
use of the center. The center-directed programs should take
precedence in use of the center. These need to have dignity
and to be worthwhile in order to merit this precedence.

4. Planning should be properly initiated, so that the
director need not do all the leg work.

Principles Involved in Program Planning

1. Community groups should participate in the planning.

2. Youth should plan with adults.

3. Volunteer leaders should be given the consideration
of having a special activity at a given time.

Specific Problems

Problem 1—What program can be offered to teen-age

groups, in addition to dancing, in a facility on third floor
of city hall, in a city of 19,000?

(a) Take the young pe0ple into the planning and give
their ideas serious considcration. Study the many rcference
books on recreation activities. The National Recreation As-
sociation publishes many reasonably priced pamphlets of-
fering program ideas. Send for their list of publications.
(Read RECREATION magazine—Ed.) The New York Youth
Commission is soon releasing a booklet on youth activities.

(b) Various indoor parties can be devised around a
special theme, such as an indoor beach party, circus party,
and so on. Adapt games, stunts, to theme. Use circle
dances, icc breakers. Let committees of young pe0ple plan
appropriate decorations and refreshments.

(c) Teen Town Theatre and children’s theatre organiza-
tions should he considered; also festivals and carnivals.

(d) High school students might like to plan parties to
take place aftcr school games.

(e) Spccial recreation events can be planned in 000p-
cration with school ccnters and with representatives from
the church, PTA, and other local agencies. Sit down with

them in conference, get their ideas, see what cooperative
projects can be develOped.

| JANUARY 1953

Problem 2—What programs are being offered for pre-
school children?

Activities can be successfully planned for preschoolers
and their mothers. “Tiny tots” groups receive leadership
in games, dancing and other rhythms, while mothers are
left free for their own recreation. “Tot Lots” have been
developed on many playgrounds.

Problem 3—Should there be programs every evening for
school age children?

This can best be solved by close planning with school,
home, and church groups. We should not be competing
for the time of children nor draw them out of the home

every night. Except on very special occasions, evening ac-
tivities should take place on weekends.

Problem 4—Can we teach dancing in community centers
without conflicting with commercial dance studios?

There is an obligation on the part of a recreation depart-
ment to offer good recreation opportunities for all, and there-
fore we should teach the fundamentals of dancing to those
who want them, and expose others to an opportunity to
try them and to develOp an interest in them. Those who care
to continue special emphasis may then choose to go to a
studio. Professional studios can COOperate by furnishing

volunteer leaders for the teaching of fundamentals, in rec-
reation centers.

Problem 5—What are you doing for young adults?

(a) In one city, where some of the young adults live
in dormitories,'assistance is given to the young peOple in
forming their own organizations. The recreation director
helps the group to obtain the use of many school-community
facilities, such as gymnasiums and bowling alleys, and
helps them to develop game rooms in the dormitories. As-

sistance is given young married couples in obtaining re-
sponsible baby sitters.

(b) A roller skating rink appeals to this age group,
as well as to other ages. Special skates can be used on your
gymnasium floor without doing any damage. (See “Roller
Skating Is Here To Stay,” page 470.—Ed.) Set aside two
evenings a week for the whole family, and provide a place
and care for babies in order to free parents for skating.

Problem 6—How many operate programs in exclusively
school facilities? In their own center? Both?
A poll of the group resulted approximately as follows:

in schools, 25 per cent; in their own facilities, 75 per cent;
in both, 60 per cent. '

A STAGE FOR PUPPETRY

 

Showing how the string marionettcs

nted hy the removal of some flooring.

A SATISFACTORY stage for puppetry, a long-felt want, was

devised for Mrs. Eve Nutting. of Eugene Field School,
Park Ridge, Illinois, by her husband who made an all-
purpose stage suitable not only for hand puppets, but for
string 1narionettcs, pupil-created “movies,” and even dio-
rainas for the display of special projects.

The four-purpose device that he designed and construc-
tcd could easily be duplicated by boys who have had some
vocational arts work or by anyone who can use a saw and
hammer. Fully equipped with a backdrop, curtain, loot-
lights and other appurtenances. tlte stage cost only $15.

The stage is quite small—32 inches wide, 20 inches deep
and 25 inches high. It is light in weight, sturdy, and
durable. The proscenium gives a rectangular view just 2-1
inches wide by 17 inches high; yet there is ample room
for as many as three or four marionettes.

Several features give the stage its versatility. The back
and sides easily slide out. depending on the stage's function.
Thus there is great accessibility. A portion of the floor,
21% inches long and 9 inches wide, at the back, is remov-
able to make room for hand puppetccrs. The backdrop,
suspended on a ‘34; inch brass curtain rod. lifts out of
notches in wooden blocks when the stage must be cleared
for string marionettes. Half-inch dowels, having saw cuts
through their centcrs, serve as Spools for threading the 18
inch shell paper on which pupils have drawn “movie”I
pictures.

Because of its compact size and light weight, the stage
is readily moved on and oil its location—a medium-sized
table.

Selection of materials for the unit was important becauw
it was to he built for permanence, safety, and appearance

appearance and durability. is free of splinters. and that is
important. of course, where children are concerned.

Recaanms

 

Concealed dowels are turned by Marjorie and David to unroll

a “movne,” drawn on a fifteen-foot length of shelf paper.

Here are some construction details. Lumber for the
framework is 1 inch by 2 inches, nailed together. Screws
are an alternative method of fastening. The leatherwood
panels, forming the sides and back, slide in grooves formed
by 1/; inch lumber strips nailed to the framework.

Chalk line was used to pull the curtain. At the ends, to
keep the string down, lead sinkers were attached.

As a footlight, a 20-watt counter light provides ample
illumination of the tiny characters. The cord was extended
through the framework at one side, with the switch hang-
ing underneath for the operation of a youthful electrician.

The dowels, 23 inches long, fit into holes bored at either
side of the stage. They are held steady at the top hy a
simple clamping arrangement. Turning of the dowels is
simplified by a wooden collar on each. Shclf paper in
lengths of 12 to 15 feet is needed for each “movie.” Ends
of the roll are tapered to the center to allow easy threading
on the dowels.

For curtain material, Mrs. Nutting used green Indian-
head; the backdrOp is the same material in gray.

Instead of the leatherwood, the panels could have been
made from masonite 1A5 inch tempered presdwood, which
is smooth on one side and finely textured on the other. A
hardboard with two smooth faces now is available, too, at
most lumber yards.

The entire ensemble was painted a gray to match the
backdrop——an undercoat and two finish coats. 0n the
proscenium, which is masonite presdwood with a per-
fectly smooth surface, Mrs. Nutting painted some Pennsyl-
vania Dutch designs in oil to add a touch of color and
gayety. Stencils or decalcomanias could be used effectively
also. To protect the finish from fingermarks, a flat varnish
was applied. When that was completely dry, a coat of wax
was applied and polished.

An interesting variation of the solid color on leather-
wood is tone-on-tone. To achieve this rich effect, a neutral
undercoat is first applied. Over that goes the selected color

which will predominate. After the first color is dry, the
contrasting color is brushed on and allowed to set for just
a minute or two; then it is rubbed off with a clean cloth
wrapped around a block of wood or a sponge. The first
color will remain on the high spots and the contrasting one
will appear in the depressions.

“Movies” provide opportunity for participation by each
member of the group. In preparing a movie about a circus
parade, every youngster in Mrs. Nutting’s third grade drew
a scene, working directly on the shelf paper which was
taped for convenience to the blackboard. Two pupils were
needed to operate the movie, and there was a need also
for curtain pullers and an electrician.

Recreation workers may be interested in the formula Mrs.
Nutting used for the puppet heads—a recipe furnished by
the Park Ridge public school art consultant, Edward I.
Reasor.

The following ingredients are sufficient to make twenty-
five units of sawdust plastic. Five pounds of flour, water,
salt, and sawdust. Place flour in a large pan and add water
until it is just covered. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring
constantly. Add salt. Cook until most of the moisture has
evaporated. Sift sawdust and place it 011 an Open news-
paper. Remove some of the dough and knead it into the
sawdust until the ball becomes firm and plastic.

Each of her pupils made a puppet head by moulding the
mixture on a Clothespin. Then the clothespins, with their
strange assortment of heads, were attached to the classroom
ventilator, where they dried out in a couple of days. A
light twist permitted the removal of the clothespin without
damage to the head.

As a pattern for the costumes, the children used cutouts
from shirt cardboards. From this hasic pattern, they used
their imaginations to create embellishments. Cut stones
(dime store variety) were used as the eyes of the leading
characters they had created. Eyes of some puppets were
merely painted. Hats were fastened with thumbtacks.

Parties l’Iucked From Thin Air

You remember the song that was
popular a couple of years ago that
went something like this:

“Did you ever see a dream walking,

Well, 1 did. . ."

llave ever been browsing
through the five and ten cent store
looking at the children’s books, read-
ing cards at the card counter, when all
of a sudden your eyes landed on a card
that gave you a splendid idea for a
party? l“Well, I have.” Immediately
you begin to weave around that card
everything that could he done for an
evening’s entertainment; how old
games could be made new with new
titles adapted to the party’s theme;
decorations and oh, ever so many
other things that could be done to
carry out the “title” of your card.

This is a good way to plan a Val-
entine Party that is just a little “differ-
ent.” In one such instance a leader
made a visit to the card shops and
found a valentine called “Cupid’s
Court.” Around this she built her
party. Each game selected became a
“ease” for the court, and took on an
apropos name such as: lleart Divorce,
Cupid's Strategy, and so on. \Vhy not
try it this year; and by all means send
to the National Recreation Association
for some good party or game materi-
als, such as the following: Parties for
Special Days of the Year, 5.50; Par-
ties from A to Z, 8.75; Hearty Valen-
tine Party, 3.15; or others?

‘Vliy Buy Them?

Every child likes to wear a printed
shirt. If you have any doubt about it
just take a look at the chain store dis-
plays of this item.

Recreation department leaders of
Auburn and Lewiston, Maine, had
long wanted to use T-shirts
printed with the department insignia,
but any budget would be too small to
buy shirts for lmndrcds of youngsters.
Therefore, the arts and crafts super-
visor suggested silk screening shirts
right on the playground, thc shirts to
be furnished by the children.

At the playground director’s train-
ing course we screened T-shirts and
sweat shirts for the Lewiston leaders,
and asked the children if they would
like them. The answer is ohvious. By
the time a half dozen were screened,
the leaders were beseiged with re-
quests. ln a matter of minutes there
was a steady stream of children run-
ning home for shirts and waving them
as they returned through the gate.

Girls, too. wanted them; and some
girls whose mothers did not approve
of T-shirts brought cotton blouses.
lu a matter of hours the department
insignia was appearing on the streets.
lly the time we had visited all the
playgrounds. citizens were saying “we
didn't realize there so many
youngsters on our playgrounds.”

sorts and lwaches throughout Maine

This mass advertising was aehieved
without making a visible dent in our
budget. Our maintenance department
made a wood frame 22 by 14 inches
hinged to a piece of 34-inch plywood.
The arts and crafts supervisor covered
this frame with a No. 8 silk screen
and cut the design on Nufilm, then ad-
hered it to the silk. This, with a screen-
ing squeege, textile screen paint. a half-

 

dozeu pieces of pressed wood forms
cut to fit inside the shirts, is all the
equipment nceded.

Departments that have arts and
crafts leaders who know silk screening
can make their own equipment as we
did. If your staff is not familiar with
this art medium you can purehase the
screen ready made from any silk
screen supply house, as well as the
paint and squeege. and they can teach
you how to run the shirts in fifteen
minutes. If the screens are properly
eleaned after each run and not cut or
broken they will last several seasons,
making thousands of runs each year.
The cost of equipment varies in dif-
ferent parts of the eountry, but should
not cost over fifteen dollars including
the paint. As members of the depart-
ment furnished the labor, we paid out
but eight dollars in each city for ma-
terials, screened roughly a thousand
shirts in each community, and the
sereens ready for next year.
Where can you find a chealwr way to

First Report, Sub-Committee on Graduate Education, National Advisory Com-
mittee on Recruitment, Training, and Placement of Recreation Personnel.

GRADUATE STUDY
IN RECREATION

 

The report of the sub-committee on Graduate Education
is based upon letters received from seven of the eleven
members who replied to the request of the chairman to re-
cord their present thinking as to what the most pertinent
issues are, with which the sub-committee should be con-
cerned. It includes some references to the recreation sec-
tion of the publication, Graduate Study in Health, Physical
Education and Recreation, developed at the national con-
ference on graduate study in these areas held at Pere Mar-
quette State Park, Illinois, in January, 1950, and financed
by the Athletic Institute. Three of the members of the sub-
committee were included in the conference membership.
The sub-committee report also includes data from an an-
nual study of recipients of degrees in recreation.

Present Extent of Graduate \Vork in Recreation

The most rccent findings of an annual study conducted
by thc Univcrsity of Minnesota Leadership Training Divi-
sion for the Training Committee of the American Recrea-
tion Society reveal that about twenty of the some fifty col-
leges and universitics which grant undergraduate degrees
in recreation also confer master’s degrees in recreation,
that five of them also offer doctor’s degrees in recreation
and that one of them in addition offers the director’s degrec,
a mid-point hctween the master and the doctoral lcvel.

Of the some 2,000 total recreation studcnts enrolled in
the fifty institutions approximately 20 per ccnt, or 400, are
graduate studcnts. In 1950-51, 3 pcrsons receivcd doctor’s
degrccs, 6 director’s degrees and some 130 master’s degrees.
New York University and Indiana University lead in num-
bers of graduate degrees conferred. Approximately 10 per
cent of those receiving bachelor’s degrees in recreation

enter graduate study almost immediately.

Those upon whom the master’s degree was conferred in
1950-51 received a median beginning salary of $3,741 in
a range from $3,000 to $5,000.

It is estimated that there are over 400 persons holding
graduate degrees in recreation at the present time and it
is assumed that the large majority are practicing profes-
sionally.

Suggestions from Committee Members

A compilation and an analysis of replies from members
of the sub-committee reveals a close association between
them and the major topics treated by the Pere Marquette
Conference of 1950, although but three of the members, as
indicated previously, were present at the conference. This
fact is encouraging for it supports the validity of the con:
ference rcport and also indicates that the sub-committee
members who have read the report may have been influ-
enced by it.

The following items were mentioned by one half or more
of the sub-committee members who sent in suggestions:

1. Recruitment procedures.

2. Admission requirements, with particular reference to
scholarship and experience requirements.

3. Internship plans, including possibility of pre-degree
service plans involving the specific agency in which the
student expects to take employment.

4. Solicitation of suggestions from key practitioners in
the field as to the content of graduate training.

5. Studies of placement and of placement Opportunities
for recipients of graduate degrees, and consideration of
follow-up plans on the part of the college or university.

6. Administrative location of the graduate program in
the individual college or university.

7. Principles upon which graduate study should be based

483

and accreditation of institutions.

8. Implementation of the Pcre Marquette Conference
report.

9. Curriculum areas including appropriate specializations
at the graduate level.

10. Differentiation between undergraduate and graduate
work, including effects of the five-year program upon the
sixth-year program and upon the doctoral sequence.

Several additional suggestions were made by individual
members of the sub-committee but the above appear to be
most pertinent.

Some of the factors such as recruitment and placement
overlap with the work of other sub-committees, but it can
be assumed that the total Advisory Committee will coordi-
uate or eliminate these overlaps.‘

All of the above items were discussed at the Pcre Mar-
quctte conference and recouuncndations were made regard-
ing them. Thus one of the first tasks of the sub-committee
is to re-examinc these recommendations and to possibly
amplify them and certainly to develop means of imple-
menting them.

In addition to what has been listed above, it appears that
the following must be included as important items for sub-
committee consideration:

I. Qualifications of the graduate faculty.

2. Research grants for faculty and students and scholar-

ships and graduate assistantships for students.

Plan of Action

The task of the sub-committee needs to be organized on
the basis of a plan of action and a division of work among
the members. Dr. llarry Edgrcn, Professor of Recreation
at George Williams College, has accepted the vice-chairman-
ship of the sub-committee and a secretary will soon be
selected.

- Girls’ and Women’s Recreation Activities

It is generally agreed that girls everywhere have certain

basic needs. Many of these which can be met through our
recreation programs are:

l. The need for understanding counsel and firm friend-
ships from adults whom they like.

2. The need to understand themselves and why they act
and feel as they do, especially in the early teen years.

3. The need to understand relationships with others—par-
cuts. brothers and sisters, girl friends, boy friends.

4. The need to be eousidered responsible, useful and im-
portant.

 The need for identification with their own community.

The Job of a Leader

To encourage participation in the early years. We need
many, many more programs for the seven- to twelve-year-
old girls. The ground work laid in childhood determines
to a great extent whether the teen ages are happy or un-
happy ones. They can be years of fun and high adventure
or of unhappiness and despair. These adolescent years are
determining what kind of a woman is being developed.

Our goal should be richer living and extended horizons
for all girls and women in our programs.

Our job is to provide activities and programs so attrac-
tive and so suited to their needs that they will take it, like
it and eonle back for more.

liooks and meetings will nev er do it. It will eomc only
through real leadership.

Recess-nos

We INVITE you to enlist with us
where it will do the most good,
on thc conservation side, in a campaign
to insure the fertility of our land, the
productivity of our forcsts; to protect
our rivers and seashores from pollution
and preserve our natural beauty and
interesting wild life. These are the nat-
ural resources which you have enjoyed
and which have attracted and sustained
millions of men, women and children.
But. . . .

Our great resources are dwindling
because we, the citizens to whom they
belong, have been wasteful and destruc-
tive beyond belief. Thoughtlessness,
carelessness, ignorance and selfishness
have been, and are, the great destroy-
ers, the cause of wanton waste, dis-
order and ugliness. Two wars and the
present rearmament and foreign aid
programs have created unprecedented
demands upon both renewable and non-
renewable resources. Forced produc-
tivity is usually uneconomical and
wasteful. Various extra-ordinary gov-
ernmental programs have been devised
for promoting or controlling produc-
tion of mines, oil wells, agricultural,
forest and grazing lands, and the dis-
tribution of water and power. Some
programs have been very beneficial,
others have become the tools of the sel-
fish, or of those who do not remember
that they must plan for the greatest
good for the greatest number for the
longest time.

Assurance has been given, by lead-
ers in thcir fields, that conditions can
be greatly improved; this being so, we
believe that we must not continue to
lose assets which cannot be replaced.
We must not neglect matters of the ut-
most importance to us, to our children
and to the ultimate destiny of the coun-
try in which we live.

A Pattern Program
for ltural Areas

l
“IIENEVER non-metrOpolitan counties
on our country’s West Coast decide to
set up a wholesome recreation program
for their young people, without exor-
bitant costs, they are likely to look to-
ward California’s Merced County for
their model.

This progressive county is located
in the fabulously fertile San Joaquin
Valley, an area which has seen an
amazing agricultural and industrial de-
velopment in recent years. With this
gromh has come an influx of popula-
tion, and a resulting problem of juve-
nile delinquency.

The county’s hoard of supervisors,
a couple of decades ago, had set up a
parks and recreation commission with
advisory powers to aid them in pro-
moting play facilities. Later, a recrea-
tion director was appointed to coordi-
nate the program. But, by early 19-19,
it was apparent to the supervisors and
their commission that these efforts sim-
ply were not enough to meet growing
recreation requirements.

Therefore. lma rd members annou need
that a special recreation levy would
he tacked on the 1919-50 county prop-
erty taxes; and it was decided that
this additional lcvy would he set at
ten cents on each one hundred dollars
of assessed valuation. Funds thus
raised would he. earmarked for capital
outlay expenditure for recreation pur-
pmes only.

The announcement of the additional
levy came at a time when the farmers
of the county were already up in arms

486

over their growing property tax load.
Some observers were predicting a small-
scale rebellion; but, surprisingly
enough, the special recreation tax gave
rise to practically no protest. Most
farm leaders were in agreement that
there was one thing upon which they
could not afford to economize—the
welfare of their children.

At this time the supervisors also em-
ployed a new recreation director—an
energetic young home town man named
Pat Cosentino who lost no time in
mapping out, with the recreation com-
missioners, a blueprint for the spend-
ing of the special funds.

First, the county was marked off into
fourteen recreation areas. Boundaries
were so drawn that each area included
one principle town, or unincorporated
community center and the territory for
which it served as a trading center.

Next came the touchy problem of
distributing the capital outlay funds
among these areas. It was finally
agreed that the fairest method would
he to allocate to each of the areas the
amount which was being raised by
the ten-cent levy upon the assessed
valuation within its confines.

Cosentino thcn plunged into the ar-
duons task of setting 11p local recrea-
tion committees in each of the fourteen
areas. Precautions were taken to make
certain that all sections of the area,
urban and rural alike, had representa-
tion on the committees. To these was
handed the power of actually deciding
how their area's capital outlay alloca-

Don Kcown

tion was to be spent. Over-all plans
were required to be submitted to the
county commission for approval. How-
ever, that body’s interest was directed
primarily toward making certain that
the expenditures were limited strictly
to capital outlay, and were within the
realms of practicality.

This ten-cent levy raised approxi-
matcly $63,000 for capital improve-
ments in 1949-50. In addition, the
county spent another 518,600 on the
salaries of the director, his secretary,
and his assistants, and for materials
and supplies for the regular recreation
programs.

An important principle of the capi-
tal improvements program was the re-
quiremcnt that all the arcas sharing
in the benefits also show an inclination
to help themselves. Before spending
their county allocations, the people rc-
siding within the areas were instructed
to first raise local matching monies, or
to donate labor of an equivalent Value.
ft is interesting that the residents of
every one of the recreation areas
pitched in enthusiastically to raise
funds or set up labor pools.

An improvement in the county's rec-
reation offerings to its youth hecamc
almost immediately apparent.

Two of the larger cities used their
allocations to help finance the con-
struction of swimming pools. Previ-
ously, there had been but one public
pool in the entire county. New base-
hall and softball diamonds sprang up,
and lights were provided for fields al-

Racaaarrox

ready in existence, to make night play
possible.

Tennis courts were constructed, re-
paired, and lighted. Playground equip-
ment was installed in parks and on
school grounds. Picnicking areas re-
ceived new barbecue pits, tables and
benches. Empty buildings were re-
modeled to serve as teen-age canteens.

It was recommended to the local
committees that the spending be largely
concentrated on the principal commu-
nity center located in each area, be-
cause too wide a dispersal of the Spend—
ing might defeat the purpose of the
program. On the other hand, rural
school grounds and the smaller popu-
lation centers were allowed a small
pr0portion of the county grants.

So successful was the program that
county supervisors, in the 1950-51 fis-
cal year, once again levied the ten-cent
tax for special recreation purposes. In
addition, board members indicated that
they planned to continue the appropria-
tions for a five-year period, during
which time, they stated, the county’s
recreation facilities would be built up

International Theatre Month"

The production of dramatic scripts,
concerned with immediate interna-
tional issucs and aimed at a better
understanding among the peoples of
thc world, was a part of the nation-
wide pattern of International Theatre
Month, March 1952. Between Califor-
nia and New York lie three thousand
miles of varied terrain. No less varied
were the ways in which hundreds of
theatres across these miles emphasized
the fact that “the theatre serves inter-
national understanding” and brought
to an ever-widening public that sense
of community which contributes to the
building of peace.

ITM was launched in 1949 by the
joint action of the American National
Theatre and Academy and the Panel
on Dramatic firts of the U. S. National

to the point where the needs of the
growing population could adequately
be met.

Those recreation areas which did
not spend all of their 1949-50 alIoca-
tions were allowed to carry such monies
over into the next fiscal year. Some 10-
cal committees thus decided to allow
their appropriations to accumulate over
a period of several years, so that they
could engage in improvements on a
major scale.

Also the spending of the local rec-
reation committees during 1950-51,
was sharply slowed down by the fed-
eral government’s construction controls.
Even so, these bodies are continuing
as best they can under the circum-
stances to provide for the recreation
requirements of their people. The em-
phasis continues to be upon improve-
ments which will be of particular serv-
ice to the county’s smaller fry.

How effective has the program been?

the point now where every community

successful, and in each succeeding year
an increasing number of community,
college, university, high school, and
children’s theatres have taken part.

The variety and scope of community
participation and of ingenious ideas
for emphasizing the basic note of in-
tcrnational understanding are described
in Curtain Call“.

‘Vhat Recreation Leaders Can Do

1. Send for information on promo-
tion, play lists to ANTA, 245 West
52nd Street, New York 19, New York.

2. Send for the stunning ITM poster

young people in the way of wholesome
recreation. As a result our youngsters
find it possible to have fun without be-
ing destructive or reckless.”

Says Vic Reich, Merced newSpaper
publisher who heads the county recre-
ation commission: “I think the pro-
gram is a wonderful example of democ-
racy at work, with the county giving
a helping hand to those communities
first willing to donate their own money
and time to the cause.”

Harry Schmidt, chairman of the
board of supervisors, and himself a
prominent farmer, states that com-
plaints from taxpayers over the funds
spent for recreation facilities “have
been just about non-existent. I wish we
could get the same kind of public sup-
port behind all of our actions.”

Sheriff N. L. Cornell, however, has
the last word: “Law officers of the
county realize that because of these ex-
penditures we are saving money on
our own budgets. If those kids weren’t
playing basketball or baseball, some of
them would most certainly be in our
juvenile detention home instead.”

Personnel

0 The National Advisory Committec
on Recruitment, Training and Place-
ment had a busy afternoon at its hrst
annual meeting, at the National Recrea-
tion Congress in Seattle. Dr. Paul
Douglass, Chairman, complimented the
forty mcmbers present on the amazing
accomplishment which had been made
in a few short months with the work
being handled entirely through cor-
respondence. Mr. Prendcrgast wel-
comed the group and explained that the
committee helonged to its memhers
and could become just as important as
they cared to make it. Mr. Sutherland
analyzed the make-up of the member-
ship and reviewed its organizational
structure and method of operation.

The main purpose of the meeting was
to hear the reports from the hve suh-
committees. This was important for
several reasons. First, ,it was necessary
to eliminate duplication, and second, to
decide on priority projects and clear
the way for the committees to proceed
with their work. Because the commit-
tees supplement each other, there is
bound to be overlapping and duplica-
tion. To takc care of this problcm, Dr.
Douglass appointed Dr. John Hutchin-
son, as vice-chairman of the committee
to serve as project coordinator. The
hve sub-chairmen will submit their lists
of assignments to him, and he, in turn,
will advise when duplication of any
kind appears.

The sub-chairmen gave exccllent re-

ports which are being published in_

RECREATION magazine. Dr. Douglass’s
article, in the November issue, intcr-
pretcd the over-all purpose of the com-
mittee. The report of the sub-com-
mittee, Undergraduate Education, by
C. K. Brightbill, appeared in Dcccm-
her. The statement for the sub-com-

 

MR. SUTIIERLAND is the director of the
Recreation Personnel Service of NRA.

JANUARY 1953

mittee, Graduate Education, by Gerald
B. Fitzgerald, will be found in this
issue on page 483.

Reports by Verna Rensvold, Garrett
Eppley and Russel F oval, working re-
spectively in the helds of recruiting,
in-service training and placement, will
follow in later issues. A number of
very urgent and timely projects are
under way and small units and task
forces are hard at work on a variety
of special assignments.

Other items on the agenda were dis-
cussed, some of which will require con-
siderable follow-up and exploration.
For instance, it was decided to explore
the possibilities of having direct repre-
sentation from the recreation held on
the Accrediting Committee of the
American Association of Colleges for
Teacher Education. Also, Dr. Douglass
will meet with us soon to consider the
possibility of a National lnventory on
Personnel. Mr. Fitzgerald has been
urging this and, during his presidency
of the American Recreation Society,
appointed a committee to consider such
a project. The National Recrcation
Association several years ago met with
a committee which resulted in such a
study for the held of social work. At
that time, we discussed with represen-
tatives of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
the possibility of their helping with a
similar study for recreation and we
have been encouraged since to believe
that assistance could be secured. The
Southern Regional Study now being
conducted by the association includes,
among other major items, a personnel
inventory for the fourteen southern
states. It is generally agreed that a
National Inventory on Personnel would
he most helpful at this time because so
many other personnel projects depend
upon this basic study. This is a major
undertaking which will require co-
operation between the association, the
American Recreation Society and sev-
eral other groups.

We were authorized to consult with
the Public Administration Service in
an attempt to get personnel standards
in recreation leadership accepted more
generally by those making classihca-

W. C. Sutherland

tion studies for cities which include
recreation positions. Since the Con-
gress, personal conferences have been
held with representatives of Louis J.
Kroeger and Associates and the Pub-
lic Administration Service. Also, the
recommendation by Mr. Eppley’s com-
mittee was acted upon favorably. This
has to do with a cooperative project
between the In-Service Training Com-
mittees of the National Recreation As-
sociation and the American Institute of
Park Executives in the preparation of a
manual on in:service training. Work
has already begun on this project.

The educational committees will have
much to report later since work has
been under way for some time on such
subjects as curriculum, campus recrea-
tion, resources, placement and held
work. The Recruiting Committee has
started on a number of special assign-
ments and the Placement Committee is
dealing with civil service matters and
will develop materials which should im-
prove standards of selection and place-
ment.

It was particularly helpful to have
Dr. Douglass with us throughout the
Congress. As you would expect, he did
a superb job chairing the meeting of
the Advisory Committee on Personnel
and the College Training Session. Also
he made one of the major addresses at
the evening general session and spoke
on the work of the Personnel Com-
mittee at the general assembly Thurs-
day morning. In all we had a good
week. The National Advisory Com-
mittee on Pcrsonnel is moving forward
with such effectiveness that it should
give real encouragement to those con—
cerned with and interested in the ad-
vancement of all personnel standards
and in the improvement of personnel
administration for recreation.

The appointment of the National Ad-
visory Committee 011 Personnel is
another indication of the importance
and concern for the “human element”
in our attempt to improve the quality
of recreation services and programs.
Personnel is the beginning and the end

of our problems, of our failures and of
our successes.

0 One of the most stimulating chal-
lenges in recreational work is the devis-
ing of new games for eager youngsters.
Hundreds of original games and new
pieces of equipment appear every year.
Few, however, stand the test of time.

It isn’t easy to invent a sound, ap-
pealing, competitive game. It requires
a great deal of ingenuity and know-
how. A game, to endure for any length
of time, must require just the right
amount of skill to make it neither too
hard to master nor too easy to learn—
to make a youngster happy to play it
and to challenge an adult to try it.

Several games, which seem to pos-
ms this combination of qualities, have
recently been developed after extensive
experimentation among large health
education and recreation groups. Close-
ly allied to popular individual sports,
they’ll soon become available to every-
one interested in promoting games with
carry-over value.

Chute Coll—One of these games,
Chute Golf, is the answer to hard-hit-
ting golf, without a cage, in small areas
like gyms and backyards. The basic
device is a regular golf ball hooked on-
to a small parachute (an eight-inch
square piece of nylon with four short
nylon rip cords) which opens in flight
and keeps the ball from traveling far.

In the beginning, every time a ball
was hit too often or too hard, it would
break away from the chute and go fly-
ing a hundred yards or more. This
weakness was traced to a direct pull on
the chute, which loosened the staple
connecting the chute and ball.

Additional experimentation produced
the solution. When the chute was so-
cured with a type of centrifugal attach-
ment that made the pull come from the
side. and a set serew was used to rivet
the hall and chute together, the device
could then take all sorts of punishment.

With the new attachment, a student
could hit the most powerful sort of
shntrw-nsiug any club—in any sixty-
foot area. The ball took off with the
chute leading the flight and descended
in rcgular parachute fashion, with the
chute above and the hall below.

tion instructor of the Pershing lun-

ior High School, Brooklyn, New York.

Its action was so true and its flight
so easy to follow that it put all the
other types of practice balls to shame.
Naturally, the size of the parachute
controlled the distance of the shot—
the larger the chute, the shorter the
shot. We found that a ten-inch chute
proved just about right for a forty- to
fifty-foot area.

Our next problem was a target for
the shots. We experimented with many
different types until we hit upon a
large canvas backdrop with rectangu-
lar-shaped, recessed pockets. This type
of suspension could catch and hold the
hardest hit chute ball.

With the addition of numbers on the
pockets for scoring and rubberized mat

tee, the game was complete. Chute
Golf, after a short demonstration, made
an instantaneous hit.

Since the boys had to meet the chute
ball well to raise it off the tee and land
in one of the pockets, the game devel-
oped real golfing ability. By choosing
sides and alternating the equipment, as
many as eight players learned to swing
a club while enjoying the competition.

Skidpins—This is another fine game
developed after a long period of exper-
imentation, and it closely simulates
howling. It is played in a small area
with a fast eleven-foot linoleum alley,
ten small quick-stop candle-pins (six-
inch long wooden dowels with metal
rings fixed in the center), and two
skid-disks (five-inch wooden disks with
two-inch handles).

The player slides the skid-disks down
the linoleum alley at the ten eaudle-
pius set up regular ten-pin style. Owing
to the true action of the disks on the
linoleum, Skidpins furnishes good train-
ing for the regular game.

It accommodates from four to eight
boys. and possesses a simplified scoring
system which enables the greenest tyro
to keep score. Each frame is always
scored as a separate cutity. There is
no carry-over to the next frame in case
of a strike or spare, as in howling.

The player gets two chances in cach
f rume. If he knocks down less than ten
pins in his two chanecs, the total num-
her knocked down comprises his score
for the frame.

If he makes a strike he gets a "ten"
for the frame plus two additional
ehauees. llis score for each extra
chance is marked in the upper corner
of the frame. It is thus possible to
score thirty points in one frame.

On a spare. the lmy gcts only one

additional chance, and his score may
thus read: ten plus seven.

An inexpensive game, Skidpins elim-
inates the need for padded backstops
and special ball racks. The equipment
is made so that the disks and pins st0p
quickly in any small area. The pin boy
sits at the end of the alley and merely
blocks the pins and disks with his fect.

0n Guard—A new type of fencing
activity, this is another of the recently
dcvelopcd individual games. It con-
sists of spearing flying disks, of various
sizes, with long wooden rapiers.

There are six fibreboard disks, in the
the shape of large flat rings, which vary

in size from eight to four inches and
possess a value ranging from five to
fifty points, depending upon their size.
The largest ring, being the easiest to
catch, has a five-point value; while
the two-inch ring, being the hardest to
spear, is worth fifty points.

Fine hand-and-eye coordination is
needed to spear these high-flying ring-
shaped disks, and we may safely as-
sume that this can carry over to fencing
with its quick lunges and thrusts
through Openings. _

The game may be played in singles
or doubles. When played as doubles,
the partners work together, sailing the
disks back and forth to build up their
score.

The game, incidentally, has just been
put on the market by General Sport-
craft Company of New York.

Pingmz'nton—This handball in the
air is the fourth game develOped
through experimental recreation. Its
purpose is to promote interest in skilled
racket-type games, through natural
swinging movements with either hand.
No difficult backhand shots are needed
to play the game, since both right and
left hands are in action.

A paddle is attached to each palm
by means of elastic straps, and the
players use nothing but forehand
swings to keep a shuttle ball going
back and forth through a rectangular
frame suSpended eight feet from the
ground.

The shuttle is simply a ping-pong
ball, equipped with a short tail to as-
sure control. The framc is a two-by-
four open net which keeps the play in
close, for accuracy. Sincc play ends
when thc shuttle fails to go through the

frame, there is no need for elaborate
game boundaries.

The simplicity of the game makes it
easy enough for any youngster to play.
It may be played equally well in a liv-
ing room or in any small outdoor space
protected from the wind.

Magnecast—Fishing is one sport
that everyone tries sooner or later. But
the thrill of casting a line is never ex-
perienced by the drop line fishermen
who merely wait for a bite rather than
strike out for one.

Magnecast develops casting ability
with a miniature rod and line to which
a magnet is attached to catch metal
fish. The quick action reel attached ver-
tically to the rod makes possible an ac-
curate ten- to fifteen-foot cast. The
magnet is then maneuvered to attract
large and small tin fish out of a shal-
low, wide-mouthed fish bowl.

Since the fish are numbered accord-
ing to size and difficulty in handling
when being reeled in, youthful casters
can compete for score.

The magnets are the rounded bar
type, and are simply tied to the end of
the lines. Their weight is just right
for short casting and they possess just
enough strength to raise the tin fish.

Box Soccer—Little equipment is
needed for this last game, other than a
soccer ball and a ten by fifteen foot
court divided in half by a center line.
As in regular soccer, the use of the
hands is forbidden.

Actually, Box Soccer resembles a
miniature game of tennis played with
the feet. The hall is returned on the
bounce or volley with head, knee, and
foot. A fifteen-point match provides a
half hour of interesting fun for young-
sters, who never realize they are learn-
ing the finer points of such a rugged
international game as soccer.

This classification: of the recreation needs of hospital patients is
excerpted front Mrs. llill's new book, Starting (1 Recreation Pro-

gram in a Civilian flaspital. A National Recreation Association

publication.

RECREATION NEEDS IN A CIVILIAN HOSPITAL

 

ALL pe0ple need some recreation, and all patients are
people. Hence, all patients need recreation to some
degree.

The ultimate goal of hospital recreation is to function
for every patient, whatever his needs. An ideal set-up
would provide bedside diversion even for short-term resi-
dents. We must, however, recognize the budgetary and per-
sonnel limitations presently confronting recreation in ci-
vilian hospitals, and accordingly gear our efforts to “first
things first,” by endeavoring to bring recreation to those
patients who need it most. Therefore, let us concern our-

selves here only with the following types of patients:

Tuberculosis LongsTerm
Chronic Child

Neuropsychiatric Patient Undergoing Rehabilitation
TttE TUBERCULOSIS PATIENT—Typically, the tuberculosis

patient may be retarded in his cure because of: excessive
boredom and lack of mental stimulation; concern for the
future of loved ones and for their financial security; con-
centration on his own illness to the exclusion of all other
interests.

Also typically, and for one or more of the above reasons.

a tuberculosis patient may defy the physical limitations of
his condition; often, he will discharge himself from the
hospital without medical approval and jeopardize his
chances for an eventual cure. Therefore, from a recreation
standpoint. it is essential to hcep ltim occupied within the
physical range 0/ his ailment.
Tttt: CttttOXtC PATIENT—The chronic patient is separated.
more or less permanently, from his family and community,
and must he compensated for these losses. It is the function
of recreation to make this patient feel useful and wanted
again, not only for his own sake, but to make him more
cooperative towards the members of the hospital staff.

The less time lltC chronic patient has to dwcll on his
illness and confinement, thc less will bc his worry, the letter
bis complaints, and the greater his coOpcration with fellow
patients and stall.

THE Nitunoesvcmnmc PATtl-ZxT—Tltis patient is usually
hospitalized because, unable to adjust to the world of re-
ality, he has retreated to another world of his own making.
llerc the function of recreation is to help entice tltc patient
hack to the real world by encouraging him to: enter group
activities and thus re-eslablish contact with his surround-

ings; arrive at a better understanding of the nature of a
group and how to get along with it; find self-expression
and, if possible, a normal creative urge. Recreation can be
of enormous assistance to the neuropsycliiatric patient in
re-channeling his energies toward constructive and health-
]ul mental and physical outlets.

THE LOXG-TEIIM I’ATIEST—The long-term patient differs
from the cltronic patient in that there is a definite, foresee-
able limit to the period of his hospital expectancy. A pa-
tient with a broken leg, who knows that he will leave when
the limb is fully mended, is a long-term patient. One with
a permanent injury to his spine is a chronic patient.

Recreation is the morale builder for the long-term pa-

tient. It affords him opportunities of occupying his time
with interesting and entertaining activities. It also prepares
him physically and emotionally for his return to out-of-
hospital living. Recreation plays a depnitc role in the ad-
justmcnt 0/ the long-term patient to his situation and the
subsequent speeding-up 0/ his recovery.
THE CHILD PATIENT—The child has a particular need for
happy and healthful play activity when confined by illness
or injury. He often suffers an emotional shock when first
hospitalized—a feeling of being cut off from his normal
world.

The problem here is to provide warmth and understand-

ing to replace loss of the love and security of the child’s
home environment, and to allcviate his natural fear of
the hospital. Comes and toys can be as valuable as an addcd
medicine to a child. It is up to you to make it GOOD

is the restoration of the handicapped to the fullest physical,
tncntal, social, vocational and economic usefulness of which
they are capable.

Recreation for the rehabilitation patient has important
resocialization aspects. The patient spends his time rc-
learning the process of group living, and is taught how
to get the maximum out of the physieal ahilitics remaining
to him. This work is strenuous and often discouraging to
the patient at the outset. Therefore, recreation should strive
to: relax the patient after his exhausting day with the re-
learning process; counteract the discouragements resulting
from this process; provide him with new and healthful in-
terests both for his stay in the hospital and for his return
to the community. Recreation can assist the rehabilitation
patient immensely in overcoming his sell-consciousness and
his [car of mixing with people both inside and outside the
hospital community.

Senior Citizen Activity

Membership in the Golden Age Club
of Creenville, Pennsylvania, has in-
creased from fifty-one on December 19,
1951, to over three hundred and fifty,
and attendance at each of the club’s
two monthly meetings averages two
hundred and twenty. 0n the third Sat-
urday of each month the meeting is a
birthday party, honoring all members
whose birthdays have ocCurred during
the month. The local radio station
sends an engineer to record the pro-
gram for re-broadcast on Sunday af-
ternoon. Featured on the programs are
monthly hobby exhibits and a volun-
tecr orchestra, whose lcadcr is eighty
years old.

City Park Improvements

The Columbus, Ohio, Metropolitan
Park Board is endeavoring to suit the
city’s parks to the needs of the pub-
lic. As a result of requests for permis-
sion to hold council fires in the parks,
the board has constructed a “council
’ in a secluded spot in Blendon
Woods. The circular stone fireplace is
four feet in diameter and surrounded
by inner and outer rows of log seats,
anchored to the ground—twenty and
thirty-two feet in diameter, seating
twenty-five and fifty people, respective-
ly. Because a barred owl hooted im-
prcssively when the first fire was kin-
dled, the new facility has been named
“Barred Owl Council Ring.” It is avail-

ring’

able for use by reservation only, and
adult supervision of children’s groups
using the ring is required.

After careful consideration, the board
is permitting groups to make advance
reservations for certain facilities, spe-
cifically large picnic areas. Most pic-
nic tables have been anchored to the
ground. Construction of one hundred
and twenty-five new tables is planned,
including several extra-long twenty-foot
tables for large groups. This is an ex-
periment, as the six- and eight-foot ta-
bles are the popular and standard sizes.
Barbecue pit-type stoves for group and
family use are also being considered.

“Save—It’s Your Future”

This slogan will be used in celebrat-
ing the thirty-sixth annual National
Thrift Week, January 17 to 23, 1953.
Program materials may be obtained
through local thrift institutions which
are members of the National Thrift
Committee, or from the committee it-
self—121 West Wacker Drive, Chicago.
In previous years, outstanding local
celebrations have been promoted by
committee members in Tulsa, Minne-
apolis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City and
other communities.

One specific type of saving is high-
lighted in the fall issue of the School
Savings Journal, published by the
United States Savings .Bonds Division,
Treasury Department, which outlines
recent changes and improvements in
Series E Defense Bonds. Free material
is described which, although primarily
for the use of teachers and school
classes, might be utilized by leaders in
a thrift program. A new handbook,
Teaching Thrift Through School Sav-
ings, is available from local state sav-
ings bonds offices.

A Triumph for Cooperation

The success of the third annual ln-
ternational Square Dance Festival, held
in Chicago on November 8, was at-
tributed to the smoothness with which
its sponSors worked together and with
the recreation leaders of the interested
colleges and midwestern cities. And
the Spirit of‘ fellowship, which was the
keynote of the festival, was a direct
result of the five pre-festival dances.

These were an innovation in 1952, in-
troduced by the Chicago Area Callers
Association, in cooperation with the
Chicago Park District. Admission to
the dances was free to out-of-town
visitors, and visiting callers were in-
vited to do most of the calling. Chi-
cago Park District’s Walter Roy, gen-
eral chairman, reported a total attend-
ance at the festival of more than six
thousand persons, only one thousand
of whom were “spectators only.” As
many as twenty-five hundred dancers

filled the three halls of the Interna-
tional Amphitheater at once.

Random Notes

The recreation department of Austin,
Texas, is celebrating its twenty-fifth an-
niversary this year. . Extra-long
twenty-four-foot picnic tables are prov-
ing popular in public parks in Miami,
Florida. Two are used in conjunction
with an especially designed barbecue
pit in Crandon Park, available to large
groups by reservation and subject to a
service fee. . . . Off-season classes of
sports instruction are conducted in
Wellesley, Massachusetts, so that be-
ginners may learn. the fundamentals be-
fore a season starts. Indoor ski classes,
using sawdust or borax, were started
about November 1, and tennis clinics
start this month. . . . The Louisiana
State Park and Recreation Commis-
sion was established by legislative ac-

tion and approved by the governor of
the state in July, 1952.

Operation Flash Bull)

Armed with cameras, film and flash
bulbs, photo-teams of members of the
Toledo, Ohio’s Local Twelve, UAW-
CIO, Camera Club took off recently on
a novel scavenger hunt. The goal was
completed eight-by-ten enlargements of
six assignment shots by 10:30 P.M.
The subjects assigned were an Aero
Willys in a gas station, a man in navy
uniform, a man fishing, a canoe ride
and an old fashioned barber pole. The
club meets every Monday and recently
sponsored a two hundred dollar prize
photo contest, with subject matter re-
stricted to the local’s own activities.

Harvth repeatedly seen in RECREA-

TION magazine and in the Sum-
mer Playground Notebook suggestions
on evaluation of the recreation pro-
gram by parents and children (see
Leadership Evaluation—A Cheek List.
$.25. National Recreation Association.
—Ed.), we thought we might try it this
summer in a small way. At least the
attempt was not a complete failure be-
cause we made both youth and parents
feel we cared what they thought.

For the parents we used:

llow do you feel about the summer
recreation program?

1. Do you feel that your children
benefitth by the playground program?
“Yes”—100 per eent.

2. llavc your children lcarncd any-
thing new and good? “Yes"—100 per
cent.

3. Do your children get along better
with other children? “)’es"—97.5 per
eent.

4. Do your children play at home
any games learned on the playground?
“Yes"—-90 per cent.

5. What new activities would you
like your child to have next summer?
Satisfied with the program as it was
—67.5 per cent. There were 32.5 per
cent who wanted some of the following
activities:

Special leader for tiny tots on grounds
where all ages attend

More swings for tiny-tots and for older
children

Children taught to plait rugs

More dancing and singing

More Sports activities

Two-thirds of the questionnaires
given out were returned. We tried to
keep the number given out down to a
minimum because the leaders were so
busy with other activities.

For the youth we used:

1. Did you have fun? “Yes”——-99
per cent.

2. Did you make anything in crafts?
“Y es”———92 per cent.

3. Did you learn five new games?
“Yes”——70 per cent. (The other 30 per
cent were made up from a playground
where the leaders were a bit on the
weak side.)

4. Did you learn three new songs?
“Yes”—54 per cent. (Here is some-
thing on which we must work next sum-
1nerl)

5. Did you play in the rhythm
band? “Yes”-—67 per cent. (This was
a good percentage.)

6. Did you learn any new dances?
“Yes”——56 per cent. (This we felt re-
sulted from the fact we taught some
dances the children had learned in
school.)

7. At home do your play any of the
games you learned on the playground?
“Yes”——75 per cent. (This we felt was
very gratifying.)

8. Did you like the playground
leaders? “Y es”-—97 per cent. (The
leaders collected the papers so—maybe
the children weren’t honest about it.)

9. What would you like to do next
summer that you didn’t do this sum-
mer? Satisfied with the program as it
was—40 per cent. There were 51 per
cent who wanted some of the following
activities:

More girls’ softball teams
Free swimming pools

Swimming lessons
Suit making

Weaving classes
Dancing

More boys” softball (We had a teen-age
league and a midget league.)

More singing

Painting on glass (Most playgrounds
did some of this.)

Modeling

A baseball team (We are not permitted
to have hard ball on playgrounds.)

Making rag dolls

More plays (This can certainly be cor-
rected.)

A wading pool

A swimming party

A man instructor (How we would like
to find some men, God bless ’em,
but our salaries are too low.)

More paddle tennis

More square dancing

Straw rides

In summary we might say, from
these requests, that we are not doing
too good a job with the teen-agers,
with dramatics, nor with music.

We changed the questionnaire for
youth a bit from the one published in
the Summer Notebook because some of
the above information was vital to our

planning for 1953.

TIPS FROM OUR READERS

Getting Them Home Safely

“Get home safely.” How
have you said these words to groups
of children leaving the recreation cen-
ter after an evening’s activity. We
hope they get home without mishaps;
and efTorts should be encouraged to
reduce accidents for these youngsters.

often

Bicycle riding is a major form of
transportation for boys and girls. A
bike safety program thus assumes
greater importance in our eflorts to
reduce accidents.

Anyone who has ever driven an au-
tornobile has gone through the har-
rowing experience at least once, and
probably many times, of having to
swerve sharply or jam on the brakes
when a bicyclist riding without lights
or reflectors looms up in the car's
path. it has been said that it is ditli-
eult to put experienced heads on
youngsters and it is perhaps too nmch
to expect them to realize the danger of
pedaling their bikes on busy city
streets or on the highway at night
without lights.

With all the safety campaigns that
are waged constantly, we often won-

der why there hasn‘t been more em-
phasis on bicycle safety measures. As
part of its bicycle safety program,
members of the recreation stafi of the
Union City, New Jersey, Board of lid-
ucation "Lite-A-Bike"
campaign. More than 260 school stu-
dents brought their two-whcelcrs to
Roosevelt Schoolyard to be equipped
Scotch-Lite, a reflecting tape.

organized a

with
which is visable as much as a quarter
of a mile away when pin-pointed by
an auto’s light.

Lt. Barney Halloran, operator of
the police department‘s “Voice of
Safety” ear and director of the Union
City sehool safety patrols. cooperated
by instructing the children in safe bi-

 

cycle riding procedures and the city
laws for bicycles. The students then
applied the tape to their bikes. The
material was put on the front forks,
handle-bars, and front and rear feud-
ers. Thus the bike became visable to
the motorist when the headlights rc-
flccted light back to him. lle had
plenty of time to slow down and avoid
a collision with the bike and rider.

Cost of the project is inexpensive.
A fifty-foot roll costs $9.30—about ten-
cents per bike.

The “Lite-A-Bike" campaign can
aid in the reereation program, not
only from the publicity the department
receives, but in providing a worth-
while project which aids in our safety
program. Getting them home safely
should be seriously considered by rec-
reation leaders.

TV Note

Announcement has been made by
the American Telephone and Tele-
graph Company, owner of the micro-
wave and co-axial cable, that Frank
Capra, well-known Hollywood film di-
rector, has been signed to produce a
series of thirteen one-hour, semi-docu-
mentary science films for television.
The first film of the series, The Sun,
will be released in the fall. The moon
and other celestial bodies will be the
subjects of following films.

Radio Program for Teen-Agers

One of the most successful of local
radio programs produced by a recrea-
tion department goes 011 the air every
Saturday morning from the recreation
center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
The master of ceremonies is “Raven”
Dave, local WIBR disc jockey. “Teen-
Town Rally in Dave’s Alley” is built
around the amateur talent of teen-
agers and attracts a “live” audience of
between two and three hundred teen-
agers for each hour-long broadcast.
Any local youngster with talent can
get 011 thc program by getting in touch
with the recreation department. The
Recreation and Park Commission and
the master of ceremonies have devoted
time and effort to arranging novel
events and obtaining guest artists of
special interest to teen-agers. Top
radio stars, prominent Sports figures,
well-known “jive” bands, and even a
young lady who hypnotized the Inas-
tcr of ceremonies, have appeared on
the programs. Free courses in voice
training have been offered to any am-
atcur vocalist winning a weekly con-
test. Convincing proof of the radio
show’s value as a public service pro-
gram, and of its popularity with the
radio audience, was demonstrated
whcn, aftcr sevcral months, it acquired
a sponsor——a local bakery. Recently,
a half-hour of the program, has been
sponsored by a local merchant to pre-
sent a style show which has drawn
over-flow audiences.

Singing Time

Arranged by Ruth Heller and Walter
Goodell. Hall and McCreary Com-
pany, Chicago. $.50.

This is a collection of one hundred
and fifty of the best known and loved
songs of our people, with new settings.
The addition of such features as des-
cants, humming accompaniments, echo
and answering effects, and vocal imi-
tations, should make the book espe-
cially interesting to the recreation
leader. The editors had in mind, par-
ticularly, “the rousing community sing,
the church get-together, the camp
gathering and the little knot around
the piano at home,” and they have
carried out their purpose with taste
and discrimination.

All the songs may be sung in unison,
but the majority lend themselves also
to four-part singing with mixed voices.
Included in the collcction are folk and
home songs of America; songs inheri-
ted from other countries; hymns, sa-
cred songs and carols; Spirituals; pa-
triotic and national songs; songs by
famous composers; bits from minstrels
and the Gay Nineties; songs of senti-
ment, college, fellowship and fun songs.

Dictionary of Games

J. B. Pick. Philos0phical Library, In-

corporated, New York. $4.75.

Here is a unique addition to your
games library—a collection of 458
games and how to play them, as selec-
ted and played in England! Many of
them are familiar, but with English
names and variations. Many will be
new to you, and will thus add variety
to your indoor and outdoor game pro-
gram.

Thc book is divided into three major
scctions. The first contains outdoor

games, and is sub-divided into “in-

formal” games (games of low organi-
zation) and “full-dress games” (high-
organized games). The latter section
contains some fascinating games sel-
dom, if ever, heard of here—“bicycle
polo, shinty (a Scotch game more vio-
lent and exciting than hockey), and
Korfball, a basketball-type game that
can be played with mixed groups, and
which has become the second most
popular game (after Association Foot-
ball) in the Netherlands.

The former includes ball
“race and romp” games, outdoor tag
and tug games, and outdoor tool and
toy games, including English variations
of marbles, hopscotch, quoits, and some
often read about in English novels,
such as “Conkers.”

games,

The second major section gives the
rules and history of many games
like basketball, badminton, water polo,
rackets, and so on, and includes a
special section on gymnasium games,
including ball games, “romp and re-
mainder” games and tag games.

The section on indoor games in-
cludes many of the card games (even
Canasta) variations of dice, domino
and dart games, parlour games, pencil
and paper games and word games.

The background material given is
very interesting, and the collection is
written in a good-natured, informal
style. The book is a nice size and at-
tractively bound. You’ll like iti—Vir-
girlie Musselman, Program Service,

Party Fun for Boys and Girls

Lillian S. Graham and Marjorie Wac-
kerbarth. Prentice-Hall, Incorpora-
ted, New York. $2.95.

A real find, this party book! First,
bccause it’s fun to read. Second, be-
cause it’s practical! Yes, all these
parties have been tested. And they are
nicely organized—parties for small fry,

for girls, for boys (even roughnecks)
and parties for special holidays.

The last section of the book has short
but well-prepared chapters on back-
yard play, travel games, picnic fun for
family groups, play activities for the
sick child and other phases of home
play.

Excellent for parents, and full of
good ideas for recreation leaders look-
ing for good party ideas for clubs, or
other groups of youngsters.

Handbook for Teaching
Piano Classes

Prepared by the Piano Instruction
Committee. Music Educators Na-
tional Conference, Chicago, 1952.
$1.50.

This little paper covered book of
eighty-eight pages was prepared for the
use of schools; but it also presents
numerous points of value to the recrea-
tion leader who is considering the in-
troduction of group music instruction
for young pe0ple or adults. Chapters
on preparation of the teacher, class-
room equipment, care of the piano and
evaluation of teaching materials should
be especially useful. In a lesser degree
the chapters devoted to levels of
achievement for different age groups
should be of service, too, since‘ they
can be adapted to the needs‘ of non-
school pupils. The book includes a
comprehensive list of colleges and con-
servatories in all parts of the country
which now offer, or are planning to
offer, courses in class piano instruc-
tion and class piano methods. One of
the eleven illustrations shows a group
of school principals, supervisors and
teachers participating with the students
in a summer school piano class at the
University of Houston, Houston, Texas.
