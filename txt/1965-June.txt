stead a natural sewage lagoon.”

The Public Health Service’s Division
of \Vater SUpply and Pollution Control
reported to the Kerr Committee that
sewage “is discharged into the North
Branch from virtually all the towns and

recreational mecca. .

villages on the watershed, and sewage
treatment facilities are practically non-
existent.”

When the Potomac reaches the Wash-
ington metropolitan area, its speed is
slowed by tides and winds from the
Atlantic Ocean. The water begins to
move languidly to and fro, ,circling
between the banks like a lake. The PHS
found that “in effect, sewage from the
Washington metropolitan area is dis-
charged into a sluggish pond,” and that
“the sewage remains in the metropoli-
tan area for many days.” The PHS re-
port was dated January 1960.

In the few years that have elapsed
since the Kerr Committee hearings,
the pollution of the Potomac is slowly
being cleaned up.*

President Johnson in his message to
Congress on Natural Beauty, February
I965, said of the Potomac:

The river rich in history and memory
which flows by our nation’s capital
should serve as a model of scenic and
recreation values for the entire coun-
try. To meet this objective I am asking
the Secretary of the Interior to review
the Potomac River basin development

Army Engineers, and to work with the

THE DELAWARE

The once-proud Delaware River
turns into an odious sewer between
Philadelphia and Wilmington. This
huge metropolitan complex pollutes the
river with wastes equivalent to the out-
put of four and a half million people.
Not only is the Delaware heavily con-
taminated by sewage and industrial

Various portions of the Mississippi

quick remedial action is necessary if
fish life in the river and the integrity of
the water supply are to be maintained.
The mOst hair—raising pollution episodes
occurred recently, along the lower por—

ports of major fish kills led to intensive
hearings by the Public Health Service.

an estimated five million fresh— and

A FRIEND IN

GUEST EDIT

 . . . and an all important part of outdoor recreation

Ralph C. Wilson
WATER is man’s oldest friend, his

most valuable servant, his most
precious natural resource. Often called
“the key to nature’s treasure house,”
water creates beauty in our landscapes,
supports fish and wildlife, and provides
much of our recreation. Fishing, boat-
ing, swimming, and water skiing give
pleasure and enable us to return to our work-a-day world
refreshed and renewed.

Nothing, not even the air we breathe, is more important
to mankind than clean water; and yet, most of us never
give it a second thought, except when there is too much of
it or too little, during a flood or a drought. Except at such
times, we take water for granted. We assume that there will
always be water and that we can do whatever we like with it.

As a result, we are seriously neglecting—actually mis-
treating—this old friend and servant to such an extent that
many of our uses of water are endangered or actually made
impossible. We pour into our lakes, pools, streams, and
harbors wastes from our bathrooms, laundries, kitchens,
hotels, and hospitals along with acids, chemicals, and oils
from our factories. We are making these waters unsightly,
dangerous, and unfit for use. The effects of water pollution
are obvious to the eye as well as the nose. Dead iish in
the river, floating sewage, gas bubbles, and the unmistakable
odor of decaying sewage.

Pollution destroys the economic and recreation value of
riverbank and lakeshore property. Beaches are closed; fish
and wildlife die; and no one wants to boat on or picnic
beside smelly, sewage-laden waters. When we pollute our
waterways, we deprive ourselves and those who follow us
of the real joys of outdoor recreation. If we clean up our
waters, we can enrich our lives manyfold.

 

ABUNDANT usable water is every American’s birthright
and responsibility. Nature’s wealth is not unlimited.
Shall we continue to use good clean water and return it
polluted? Shall we continue to despoil our streams and
rivers until they become an odorous blot on the country-
side? Or shall man and nature join hands as friends and
work together to keep Cod-created waters as He intended
them to be?

Soil and water are recognized as our basic natural re-
sources. The way we manage these resources and their

b RESEARCH ANNUAL. Research in Rec-
reation—1965, Part I: Theses and Dis-
sertations 1962-1965, is now available
from the National Recreation Associa-
tion Book Center for $2.50. It has par-
tially annotated listings for 431 studies
and fifty additional abstracts for studies
cited in the 1962 edition. The citations
are verified by the librarians of the sev-
enty institutions contributing studies.
The topics cover in general the whole
field of recreation with a considerable
number of studies relating to physical
recreation activities, community cen-
ters, activity preferences and surveys,
the ill and handicapped, and personal-
ity. The publication also includes a
summary of the status of recreation re-
search in the colleges.

} THE CONTROVERSY on the pros and
cons of allowing the Consolidated Edi-
son Company to build a “pumped stor-
age” plant on Storm King'Mountain
above the Hudson River rages un-
abated. Even though the Federal Power
Commission’s “National Power Sur-
vey,” and President Johmon’s mention
of preserving the Hudson, in his Special
Message to Congress on Natural Beauty,
turned it into a national issue, Cover-
nor Rockefeller of New York has
startled the state by coming out in sup-
por of Con Ed and its Hudson River
project.

This action is in opposition to the
government’s campaign for pollution
control to restore and/ or preserve our
great scenic rivers, and also in spite
of the fact that the New York State
Joint Legislative Committee on Natural
Resources stated in February 1965 that
it would regard authorization of the
plant “as contrary to the best interests
of the people of New York State.” Sen-
ator R. Watson Pomeroy, chairman of
the bipartisan committee, who had been
directing a study of possible effects of
the plant on natural resources, stated
at that time, that the committee decision
reflected “the unanimous opinion of
committee members.”

A bipartisan campaign to establish
“a federally protected scenic and recre-
ational preserve on the lower Hudson,”
sapportcd by Senators Javits and Ken-
nedy, was begun in Washington in
March according to The New York
Times of March 3, I965. The cospon-

sored bill would restrain power plant
and flood control projects along the
river, but it is not expected that it could
become law before the Federal Power
Commission has acted on a license for
the controversial plant. President I olin-
son called for federal power to end
pollution of water and of air at its
source.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

t INDIVIDUAL PERMITS to visit a single
national park, forest, or other federal
recreation area numerous times for the
remainder of 1965 may now be ob-
tained, according to an announcement
by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L.
Udall. A permit will be priced at no
more than five times the daily entrance
rate, usually twenty-five cents or fifty
cents for an individual. In affect, it will
be a season ticket to that particular area.
In contrast, the $7 Recreation/Conser-
vation Sticker now being sold to admit
the holder and all passengers to all des-
ignated federal areas is the greatest bar-
gain—unless you want to stick to one
area all season!

We are breaking down this fertilizer
factory, destroying sections of it daily.
The marshes are disappearing beneath
housing developments. They are being
smothered by dumps. They are being
gutted by marinas. They are being
killed by pollution. ,

Some forty-five thousand acres of
salt marsh still exist along the Massa-
chusetts coast. in a recent report in
which the Massachusetts Marine Fish-
eries Division discussed an annual de-
struction rate of one percent in salt
marshes. the division noted, “The con-
stant increase in number of permit ap-
plications to dredge and fill indicates
that this rate is on the brink of explo-
sive acceleration.”

One wonders whether this destruc-

tion would continue if Massachusetts'

residents realized that a salt-marsh acre
produces nutrients that are harvested
each year as $300 worth of seafood?
The best cattlelands of the West produce
far less. Scientists have described the
salt marsh as the richest producer of
meat in America. By what epitaph will
hungry generations honor this genera-
tion?

To halt this erosion of natural wealth.
the Massachusetts Conservation Coun-
cil has named a Committee headed by
Allen H. Morgan, executive vice-presi-
dent of the Massachusetts Audubon So-
ciety. The committee’s task centers

upon devising means of saving the salt

tinuing protection. It is a tough task
—so tough, that there is little chance of
success without the cooperation of town
conservation commissions, town salt-
marsh committees, and all the public
and private agencies concerned with

The mudflats have been removed and

increased from twenty-eight acres to
seventy-eight acres: approximately two'
miles of channel were improved and
deepened; two thousand feet of new
channel were dredged: current at the

in addition, pollution was cleared to
the extent that the state was able to
move its “posted” area a half-mile
south. Incidents of hepatitis resulting
from eating clams taken from the water
were greatly reduced. The gnats dis-
appeared.

-. nst promote good outdoor manners to counteract
ions and unthinking damage to our natural areas

conservationists, concerned with keep-
ing some public lands in their God-
given natural state. are advocating
stricter visitor regulations; more users’
fees; even closing, until they recover,
over-used areas such as Yosemite and
Yellowstone.

Yet our exploding population is ever
more urgently seeking recreational re-
lease from the tensions of modern city
life, even while the available lands are
shrinking under the housing and com-
mercial needs of that same population.
Crowding and overuse are definitely
contributing factors to the rising dam-
age. However, the greatest cause, by
far, is the lack of knowledge and under-
standing—of nature, its processes and
hairline balance; and of the purposes
for which certain public lands were
eXpressly reserved, and which regulate
their visitor rules. Those who know the
problem best—embattled rangers and
management personnel—agree that the
solution lies in public education coupled
with law enforcement.

Most folks will listen to reason when
a problem is eXplained to them. There
is only one way to handle the adamant,
malicious smart aleck: Report him, as
rapidly as possible, to the nearest au-
thority. With rangers and enforcement
staffs increasingly outnumbered, this is
the individual’s responsibility. The van-
dal’s hand is in your wallet, and his
foolish acts are reducing your outdoor
privileges. He may even endanger your
life! A variety of existing laws outlines
fines and/or prison sentences that may
be imposed on offenders; but first they
must be caught and prosecuted. Ex-
penses incurred by witnesses are paid
an". sometimes. a reward.

Ova OF THE MOST successful pro-
grams ever undertaken to educate
the other ninety-five percent of our
rccreatiouists, real and potential, is be-

ing carried on by the Good Outdoor

Manners Association (COMA) Box
7095. Seattle. Washington 98133. The
association has been convincingly
poiming out that many of our common
outdoor practices. through repetition,

are so damaging that we can no longer
afford them. A new conservation ap- _
proach to outdoor recreation, in keep-
ing with today’s accelerating needs, is
mandatory.

Volunteers among the group’s mem-
bers are presenting slide lectures, illus-
trating the problems and possible reme-
dies, to thousands of men, women, and
children throughout western \Vashing-
ton and the Los Angeles metropolitan
area. They are also preparing addi-
tional sets with taped commentaries for
loan-out to U.S. audiences anywhere.

“Our slide-lectures are proving to be
our most useful tool,” says Mrs. Olive
Entenmann, chairman of the GOMA
speakers’ bureau. “The visual impact
of dreadful damage contrasted with im-
pressive views of scenery and facilities
as they should be—in good condition—
and demonstrating ‘how-to’ have good
outdoor manners is really bringing the
message home to our audiences. Most
of them thank us for bringing to their
attention problems they never before
realized existed.”

Other members construct displays for
group meetings. store windows, et cet-
era; write news releases and articles for
local, regional and national publication;
publish a monthly newsletter for mem-
bers and cooperating organizations; de-
velop and distribute literature and post-
ers; participate in local conservation
conventions and workshops; appear on
occasional radio and TV programs; and
sponsor repair and cleanup expeditions

THE TITLE of “1964’s Worst Bust-ers”
went to two Oregon teenagers who
shot the lock off a snowgate on Larch
Mountain (east of Portland, rising from
the Columbia River Gorge) and de-
stroyed snow-warning signs. Their van-
dalism contributed directly to the deaths,
from exhaustion and exposure of two
Portland State College students whose
car stalled in deep snow on the moun-
tain road. A mock trophy—a shot-up
campground sign bordered with beer-
can tabs, broken glass and others camp-
ers’ trash—was held in proxy for the
two culprits who must live the rest of
their lives with their consciences.

A decorative Citation of Merit went

nia, as 1964’s “Best Booster.” Scores
of volunteers joined him in his year-
long campaign to restore the historic
seven-mile trail up nearby Mount Wil-
son. They completed the job last spring.

Cameraman Roy Williams, newsman
Bill Robison, and Seattle’s KIRO Radio-

The cultural series began in July on
a quiet note with the showing of a film
with a “This is Our Town” theme, a
ballet performance, and musical selec-

point, the tempo picked up. Annual

The programs are Widely acclaimed,
and, most of all, extremely well at-

or vocal, were given by local talent. The
choral concerts have been given by the
following groups: Williamsport Music
Club, Civic Choir Singers, Shiloh Bap-
tist Church Choir, Williamsport Con-
sistory Choir (a Masonic group), St.
Boniface Catholic Church Boys Choir,
the Gesang Verein Harmonia and Turn

a group of spiritual singers. Inter-
spersed with this music have been ap-
pearances by the Brass Quintet, the
Little German Band, and the Earl Wil-

For drama, the public in 1963 was
treated to a play, Servant of Two Mas-

Drama in the Barn

Virginia Rankin, staff writer, Gazette

THE OLD IIATCIIERY has housed many
fledglings . . . from newborn chicks
to neophyte actors. The Valley Round
Theatre in Corvallis, Oregon, is an old
barn that until four years ago was used
as part of a chicken hatchery. The. the-
ater’s facilities are used not only by an
adult group which produces four or five
plays each summer but for a thriving
junior group as well, sponsored by the
Corvallis Parl.s and Recreation Depart-
ment.
The junior drama program was start-

ed three summers ago under supervi-

 

sion of a local high-school drama teach-
er, assisted part time by a teenager. The.
program wasdesigned for children aged
nine through seventeen. That first sum-
mer, sponsors hoped that at least thirty
youths would register for the course . . .

That’s the theme of the 47th Na-

an utterance of Daniel H. Burnham,
Chicago Park District planner.

should be one of the most productive
as well as one of the most enjoyable
ever. Over forty special-interest sessions
are scheduled covering all aspects of
recreation. In addition, two 3-day insti-
tutes will be conducted within the Con-

VERY sports governing body in the United States (such
as the Amateur Athletic Union, the Amateur Fencers
League of America, the National Recreation Associ-
1, et cetera) has been accepted by the world governing
«* for the sport concerned. For example, the Interna-

1 Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), which con-
. track and field on the international level, accepts the

.' must encourage all organizations to be a part of the
blished and recognized governing bodies. To be effec-
. in this effort, a clear understanding of amateur athletic
-. must be provided educators, athletes, parents, volun-
workers, and athletic officials of all organizations in
United States. It is important and necessary that the
wing procedures be constantly brought into focus. They
recognized and followed throughout the world.

i-irst, let’s take a schematic look at the organization of a
ional amateur Sports governing body. If our total U.S.
ram is to roll along in a progressive manner, we need
eel with a good hub and strong spokes.

e spokes are the “closed” programs; that is, those re-
cted to the membership of the many excellent amateur

uously conducted and/or sanctioned by the organizations

lions involved in one sport may come together under the
direction, supervision, and sanction of the recognized gov-
erning body.

Open programs usually lead to community, regional, or
national championships. Other open programs are sanc-
tioned by the governing body to provide opportunities for
inter-organization competition and international events. As
far as the AAU is concerned, it has exactly such a wheel!

All recognized United States governing bodies for sports
on the Olympic and Pan American agenda are listed as such
in the constitution of the United States Olympic Committee,
The USOC Constitution has been approved by the Congress
of the United States. USOC membership carries with it
the responsibility and obligation to follow International
Olympic Committee rules so that United States athletes are
eligible for the Olympic Games. Let us examine some of
those rules.

Perhaps the first very specific and basic rule is that an
athlete must belong to the governing body in his country
in order to participate in the Olympic Games! International
Olympic Committee Rule 34- states: “As a condition pre-
cedent to participation in the Olympic Games, a competitor
must be an amateur as defined in Rule 26, and a member
of the organization in his own country a [filiated to the Inter-
national Federation recognized by the International Olympic
Committee as governing that sport.”

For the sports under attack by the NCAA and their puppet
federations, the AAU is the only such federated organization
affiliated to the recognized international organization. To
qualify- for membership in the AAU, an athlete must adhere
to its rules of registration, sanction, et cetera. These rules

ORGANIZATION OF
AMATEUR ATHLETICS
IN THE U.S.

 

281.

A schematic appraisal of the AAU position

 

are based on the procedures followed by international as-
sociations.

Second are those rules stating specifically that there can
be only one such organization for a sport in each country.
All individuals and groups desiring international competi-
tion must maintain eligibility with that recognized group.
For the sports under attack, this organization is the AAU.
International Olympic Committee Rule 24 states:

“A National Olympic Committee must not recognize more
than one national federation in each sport and that federa-
tion must be affiliated to the international federation recog-
nized by the International Olympic Committee.”

Thus, even our own United States Olympic Committee
cannot recognize any other national governing organization.
This is one of the many reasons Why the sanction of another
group for, open competition cannot be recognized. To give
any recognition to the puppet federations of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association would be a breach of the
International Olympic Committee rules. Dual sanctions of
that competition which is the responsibility of the governing
body recognizes the governing authority of another federa-
tion! IOC, IAAF, and AAU rules all prohibit such recog-
nition.

The rules of the International Amateur Athletic Federa-
tion, which controls track and field competition in the
Olympic Games as well as other international track and
field competitions, are also specific in permitting only one
national governing body in each country and in requiring
international competitors to adhere to its rules and to the
rules of the national governing body concerned.

IAAF Rule I states that only one member for each country
can be affiliated to the IAAF.

IAAF Rule 4 states, “Any person who is ineligible to com-
pete in competitions under the jurisdiction of his national
governing body is ineligible to compete under the rules of
the International Amateur Athletic Federation.” The rules
of the Amateur Athletic Union of the U.S. are thus sup-

282

ported without exception by the IAAF.

The AAU is essentially a “union” of district associ
and national amateur sports organizations, as indicat
this diagram. [An AAU-NRA Advisory Committee is
tioning under the chairmanship of Ben York, superinte
of recreation in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Yor
recipient of the AAU Public Recreation Man of the
award for 1964.] The number of representatives t
board from each district is dependent upon the amo
local amateur athletic activity. Any active member
any recognized organization in that district may be e1
to represent the district.

The manner of selecting representatives to the board
aHiliated national organizations is entirely the responsi
of the organization concerned. The number of such
sentatives is determined by the impact of such organiz
upon the national and international programs. Each 0
ization may request the board to review its represent
at any time should it believe that it does not have a ju
equitable number.

Thus, all the spokes of the AAU wheel work togeth
the hub for the total U.S. program. The AAU Boa
Governors can be compared to the Congress of the U
States. The district representatives are the House of
resentatives. The direct appointments from the nat
sports groups are the U.S. Senate. All function togeth
the government of amateur sports.

To the uninformed it might appear that another 0
ization in addition to the governing body could sa
open competition on the basis that the organization ha
letes in the competition. However, if such a procedure
followed, six to ten different U.S. organizations would
the same consideration! To carry this principle for
NCAA or its puppet federation could demand san
rights of much international competition, includin
Olympic Games themselves, as they have athletes in Oly

in 1964. Field reports from National

approved than in previous years; more
new departments were established; pro-

great steps forward in planning, land acquisition, and
' lopment; and, above all, the federal government ex-
d with new legislation, programs, and services. The un-
Dedcnted activity on the federal level was the major
tation news of the year, but since it has been reported
larly in RECREATION, it need not be repeated here.

Al. RECREATION LEADERSHIP, A total of 688 paid park and
cation workers were added to local staffs in 1961, ac-
ing to returns from approximately half the municipal
‘ rtments surveyed. In addition, sixty-five new full-
executives began their duties as programs became

positions.

are separate recreation departments and thirty-one are
combined park and recreation departments. A number of
county park and recreation boards were also established.

CHANGES IN LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. Parks and recreation de—
partments were combined in twenty-five cities. In one city

they were separated and parks was put under the depart-
ment of public works. One park board and two recreation

boards were abolished and the departments were put under
the city manager.

LOCAL RECREATION BUDGETS, Budgets were up again with
more increases reported than the previous year and fewer
decreases: 756 cities reported increases, 118 had decreases,

and 70 remained the same. The following table shows the
breakdown by districts.

F555 AND CHARGES, In some districts new or increased fees
are being charged at an accelerated rate; in others there is
much talk but little change. A survey made by the South-
eastern district representative indicated that in 1964 new
fees were initiated in thirty-eight cities and charges were
increased in forty-four. Another survey in Illinois, Minne—
sota, and Wisconsin showed that fifty-eight cities have in-
creased their fee system. Although not much change was
noted in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan this year. consider-
able increase is expected in 1965.

One reason for the anticipated increase in these states—
which probably will apply to others—is a trend in financing
and construction of public park and recreation facilities.
Cities secure bank loans through municipal bonds that do
not reflect on the bonded indebtedness of the city but are
amortized through the income from the facility (revenue
bonds). In some cases, fees are raised on existing swim-
ming pools or golf courses and the increase is earmarked
for new ones. If the facilities do not exist, they may be
constructed with a five percent down-payment from the

283

general fund, the remainder to be amortized from income.
No significant trend was seen in the charging of fees in the
New England, Middle Atlantic, Midwest, Southwest, or

Pacific Northwest Districts. (-

Sources of revenue on the increase are coin lockers, vend-
ing machines, concessions, parking fees, and annual fees. A
number of cities were reported to have instituted nonresi-
dent fees. The availability of federal and state grants on
matching basis is expected to result in many cities bor-
rowing money on the basis of revenue anticipated from the
facilities. This will mean a rise in fees and charges.

RECREATION FACILITIES, Equipment and facilities acquired for
recreation in 1964 ranged from buses for senior citizens to
regional parks. Ski tows, warm-up huts, picnic pavilions,
arboretums, rifle ranges, children’s zoos, bridle paths, nau-
tical playgrounds, and literally hundreds of other facilities
were reported. The following list shows the types of new
facilities and developments reported for the year in numer-
ical order, but does not include a large number of miscel-

laneous items.

EXTRA-URBAN DEVELOPMENTS. The acquisition and develop-
ment of land and water areas outside city limits by cities,

counties, districts, state, federal government, private and
commercial organizations advanced tremendously over pre-
vious years. Naturally states which have passed bond issues
or imposed special taxes for recreation areas, like New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Minnesota,

Of course, every participant wants to
be in the play, and a role is given to
each child who can attend a reasonable
number of rehearsals. Families often
arrange camp sessions and vacations so
that their children will be home to par-
ticipate. This means that each year
parts must be found for some eighty
youngsters, so the play is double cast.

In the Corvallis drama program, the
children do everything, including the

Each of the Federated Girls’ Clubs in Sonierville, Blassachusetts, has its own

program activities and fund-raising projects.

These girls set up a Car-wash

unit to raise the money necessary to purchase jackets for their club members.

YOUTH VOLUNTEERS all over the

country have dispelled the idea
that the teen world is bounded by
Beatles, bangles, and day-dreams of gla-
mour. As interested as teenagers may
he in movie stars, baseball “greats,”
clothes, and cars, their vision is often
much broader. Many teenagers are
willing to help people outside the main-
stream of community life, as, for ex-
ample, the aged widow or the child
with a vacant stare. Because of the great
need and the challenge offered in service

.288

to others, teenagers across the country
can be found helping in homes for the
elderly, in residences for retarded chil-
dren, and in hospitals for mental pa-
tients.

The service the teenage volunteer
gives may seem at times out of charac-
ter. A girl whose bedroom is in constant

disarray may spend hours teaching a
retarded child to put away his toys. A

youth whose own theme song has been
“I’m bored” may find Himself coaxing

Each Tarp Club has a council which

UNTOLD BENEFITS

THE YOUTII WORK program in Jack-
son County, Oregon, is planned to
give a selected group of youths an 0p-
portunity for seasonal work on county
conservation and recreation projects.
It provides an opportunity for the youth
to be gainfully employed and also learn
the skills and work habits that are fun-
damental in the future course of their
training and education. Job Opportuni-
ties for this age group are limited in
this area. The limitation of these oppor-
tunities is caused in part because this
group does not have the skills or a work
background that would enable them to
qualify for even a mediocre job.
The program is planned so Jackson
County and the state of Oregon would

- reap untold benefits in training its youth

while protecting, preserving, and de-
vel0ping natural resources. It also pro-
vides an opportunity for youth to be-
come more conscious of how wise utili-
zation of these natural resources will
allect the welfare and economy of Ore-
gon for years to come.

On February 21, 1964, the Jackson

County Parks and Recreation Commis-

289

sion, under the chairmanship of Lau-
rance V. Espey, submitted to the Jack-
son County Budget Committee a pro-
posal for a Jackson County Youth Work
Program. Much study and planning
was done by Mr. Espey using the high-
ly successful Multnomah County “Ox-
bow Project” as a guideline.

Much discussion and evaluation en-
sued. It was decided to try a pilot pro-
gram, using twenty boys, one supervi-
sor, and one assistant. The sum of
$9,135 was included in the parks and
recreation department’s budget and sub-
mitted to the peOple of Jackson County
on June 11, 1964. The park department
was given the authority to proceed with
the project. It was decided that the best
time to start the project was as soon as
possible so that the boys would lose as
little time as possible between school
.and work. Also, since the program was
to last only nine weeks, the boys would
be through in time for the local pear
harvest or family vacations.

It was decided that this first youth
work program should be kept relatively
close to the high schools in the valley
for several reasons:

Io Time required for transportation.

0 Ease of control and evaluation.

0 The general public could observe.

o The area needed immediate atten-
tion because of overuse and no facilities.

0 The project was small enough and
the boys could see it finished and there-
by gain pride in accomplishment.

The county had just such an area in
Rogue Elk Recreation Area, which had
been taken over from the Oregon State
Game Commission. Plans were quickly

prepared. On June 22, 1964, at 8:30
A.M., the bus arrived at the area and

the Jackson County Youth Work Pro-

gram began.

The twenty boys from the five high
schools worked as one crew for nine
weeks. A total of 788 days of work were
performed. One boy left for California

in the middle of the program, and was-

replaced. Three boys had to be dis-
charged a week before the program
ended, one for continued goldbricking
and two because of disciplinary prob-
lems.

The biggest single cause of lost work
was poison oak. Ten boys had to receive
treatment. Only one accident was re-
ported. One of the boys out his leg with

290

a machete, but not seriously. The flu
accounted for some lost time. Altogeth-
er, forty-eight days out of a planned
897 days were lost due to sickness and
accident. Another forty man-days were
lost out of the total because of a serious
fire.

The first week the crew was given

instruction in fire fighting by the Ore-
gon State Forestry Department. The
whole crew was put on emergency call.
On August 10, 1964, a serious fire broke
out southwest of Medford. For two
days the crew fought fire with the vet-
erans. They helped bring it under con-
trol. Commendation was received from
forester Curt Neshiem far the work the
crew performed. The boys were paid
the going wages for fire fighting by the
state, $1.89 per hour. They each worked
a total of 211/2 hours in the two days.
The first day everybody was excited
about getting to fight a fire. By the end
of the second day, everyone had had it
and they were ready to go back to build-
ing parks.
EVALUATION. The real values of such a
program may not be known until these
youths have become adults. The boys
learned good work habits, a sense of
reSponsibility, and a sense of trust.
They learned to work with others. They
learned pride in workmanship and were
justifiably proud of their accomplish-
ments. Their whole attitude changed
during the program and was reflected
in their accomplishments. They learned
to earn their own way.

ing. Such is the case in the atomic-

cial activities for the adolescent, “It has

NATURE CRAFTS . . .

:RIEN'CING the handling of nature materials is great
' light for children. It helps them to adapt to their
ndings, heightens their sense of touch for textures,
. ation of colors, forms, designs, et cetera (depending,
t deal, of course, on the group leader’s awareness and
to guide and experiment). Inasmuch as everything we
nee in life is a part of a much greater experience, it
.. itial that young people have the opportunity to express
e nrges in a positive, visible art or craft form. Today
'e experience or lack thereof it is considered signifi-
u an individual’s adjustment.
~rning and the creative process takes place in unforeseen
'ons and sometimes unrecognizable instances; there-
e, as creative leaders, have responsibility of great
'tude. What is taught to a child today (advertently or
"rtently) can influence his attitudes and living thirty
hence, even for the rest of his life. (Is there any
r responsibility?)

of the objectives of the following projects is to en-
6 the child to observe what is around him, in his every
odd and playground surroundings, to gather, under
ision, appropriate nature items illustrative of beauti-
- pes and textures and to learn a few crafts he can do
em—creatively.

and let the child take it from there. Don’t impose

side of the paper up. Expose the print, glass side out, to the
sun for several minutes or until you have the desired print—
color (approx. 15-25 seconds for the red; 20—25 seconds
for blue and 40-50 seconds for black). Trial testing should
be done first, experimenting with the papers to learn what
timing will produce what shadings.

Cover the bottom of a half-gallon jar with marbles and
fill with ammonia to the top of the marbles. Remove the
print from the frame, roll into a cylinder, print-face inside,
and place into the glass jar. The marbles will keep the print
from coming in direct contact with the ammonia and the
ammonia fumes will develop the print, bringing out the
colors and setting them. Under-fuming produces pale prints;
over-fuming, harsh and dark prints. Three to four minutes
should produce the desired color. Always use a fresh supply
of ammonia for each day’s printing. Developing should be
done outside or in a well-ventilated room.

OIL PRINTING

0R THIS PROJECT you will need plenty of newspapers
plus several old mimeograph stencil backings. The sten-
cil backings are used as the palette slab because they will
not soak up the printing ink readily. (You can use either a
water or an oil base printing ink.)
0 Put a dab of the printing ink on the stencil backin".
About the size of a pea is the appropriate amount.
0 Spread the ink out just slightly larger than the object or
material you wish to print. (Make a spreader by using a
wad of newspaper.) The ink should be spread evenly and
not heavy.
0 Place object to be printed on the inked paper. If a leaf,
make certain the vein side is down.
0 Place a piece of newspaper over the leaf or material to
be printed.
0 Rub thoroughly, getting every vein or marking covered
with ink.
0 Remove the top paper and lift leaf or material carefully.
placing it on the printing paper.
0 Cover with newspaper and making certain that the leaf
or material doesn’t move, rub thoroughly, every vein, mark-
ing and edge. Your print is completed.

When making additional prints, spread out the ink evenly.
with the paper spreader, on the printing slab and proceed
as above. When prints become too light add additional ink.
VARIATIONS: interesting effects can be created by using
more than one color, or by printing one or more similar
or dissimilar objects on the same paper, deliberate use of
various colors on the same paper. and using textured papers
or fabrics.

Try these projects with some of your adult groups, too.
lt is always good to remember that “pigeon-holing” certain
projects for particular age groups is not a wise rule to follow.
l’rojects should be determined by individual or group in-
terest, not by specific chronological breakdowns. (I re-
cently observed institutionalized octogenarians making leaf
prints.) If you wish, they can be closely related to your
nature program.

Q PROGRAM

PETANQUE
COMES WEST

An ancient game migrates to

the New World

John W. Metcalfe, Notional Secretary,
Pan American Pétanque Association

PETANQUE (pronounced pay-tonic),
an outdoor or indoor type of bowl-

ing, derives its name from a French Pro-
vencal expression les pes tanqués, which
means “the feet together”———one of the
basic rules of play.

Pétanque entered the sporting scene
in France at the turn of this century,
as an easier, shorter, simpler version of
a more difficult, more complicated
bowling game (jeu de boules) played
on the continent for centuries. This
game had spread, in various forms,
hither and thither: to the British Isles,
as bowling on the green; to the Dutch
and Germans as Kegelnspiel; and
thence to our shores as alley bowling,
or tenpins.

To the International Pétanque Fed-
eration, headquartered in Geneva,
Switzerland, now belong nearly a score
of nations. In 1965, the IPF will again
stage a world championship meeting, to
be held in Madrid, Spain, this fall.

France, via La F édération Francoise
de Pétanque at Marseilles, continues to
be rulemaker for the world. From
spring through fall, France is the scene
of a caravanserai of village, town, city,
regional and provincial contests lead-
ing up to a three-day grand national.

While there have long been some
pétanquers in the U.S., it was not until
1959 that an American organization
was formed. It was then that Jean
Bontemps, a former French resistance
lighter, and his wife Paulette decided
the U.S. could use pétanque. Mr. Bon-
temps proceeded to launch a one-man
campaign. Today, he heads the Pan
American Pétanque Association and is
vice-president for the U.S. in the Inter-
national Federation. There are now
regional chapters and pétanque clubs

292

in more than a dozen states, branches
in Canada and Mexico, even American
outposts in North Africa.

PETANQUE variously resembles sev-
eral other “national” games:
American horseshoes, Scottish and Ca-
nadian curling, and, of course, Italian
boccie and English lawn bowls. A mis-
sile is aimed to reach a target position
rather than, as in tenpins, to knock
down the target itself, and points are
scored according to how close these mis-
siles come to the target. It follows that
the player or team whose missile comes
closest, or who prevents the adversary’s
from coming closest, or who, best of all,
achieves both tactics is the one that
scores the most points.

Pétanque requires no elaborate equip-
ment or facility. Essentially and liter-
ally, this game can be played anywhere,
in any season, in any garb, by any age,
by any number, by either sex. The ex-
penditure for basic equipment—per-
.haps once every decade—comes to as
little as four or five dollars, since this
basic equipment consists simply of two
essentials: the missiles (a pair of them)
and the target. In pétanque, the missile
is a metal ball, and the target position is
pinpointed by a smaller, wooden jack-
ball. The metal ball is hollow and made
of hard Swedish steel (less often, of
bronze) tempered, treated, machined,
and precision-balanced; plated with
zinc or chrome or a special' steel; en-
graved in a pattern of scribe lines for
“grip” and “English”; stamped with
numbers, initials, symbols, et cetera, for
identification. The weight of this bowl-
ing ball, or boule, cannot exceed 13/1
pounds: its diameter cannot be more
than 31/8 inches nor should be much
less than 23/4 inches. For children,
however, special lightweights are made

weighing only about a pound and mea-

two opposing teams: with three, for in-

balls against the other two with two
or three balls apiece—and all taking
turns, if so wished, as the “loner”
against the pair.

Deliver the ball with knees slightly
bent and body leaning a bit forward at
the hips; left arm (for a right-hander)
serving to balance; right arm slightly
bent at the elbow during the swing,
then fully extended almost along aim-
ing line-of—sight at the moment of re-
leasing the ball. The ball is released
“under the hand” to give back-spin and
better accuracy.

The object of the game is for a player
or team to roll, bounce, loft, lob, rico-
chet, or otherwise deliver the balls so
that as many as possible will come to
rest closer to the jackball than any of
the adversary’s, and by so doing will
count for points.

By now it is evident that there are
two main tactical methods of play: to
bowl in a closest counter to the jack,
which is “to point,” and “to shoot,”
which is to bowl away the adversary’s
closest counter or counters. Much of
the game’s interest comes from the in-
terplay and strategic use of these offen-
sive and defensive moves.

For illustration, let’s invent two
three-man teams, “A” and “X,” and
follow them through a few typical seg-
ments of play in a game of pétanque:

 

TUE START: By toss of a coin, Team A
is elected to lead off. Bowler A-l chooses
a point of delivery, and then marks on
the ground, with his foot or a stick or
a piece of chalk, a “delivery circle” or
“ring” between sixteen and twenty
inches across. This will be the point
from which each bowler on each side
must bowl every ball during this first
“inning”—feet together and flat on the
ground within the ring. Standing in
the ring, A-l tosses out the jackball in
whatever direction he chooses. so that
it comes to rest at least 16 feet but not
more than 33 feet away (if he misses
or exceeds these limits, he must try
again), and he then proceeds to bowl
his first ball.

Next, the X team’s lead-off player
bowls his first ball, and it ends up closer
than A-l’s. A-l then bowls again to
try to recapture “closest” position, but
his second ball fails to do so, and so
his teammate A-2 must try. With his
first ball, A-2 also fails, but gets his

second in as a “counter.”

X-l then bowls his second ball but
fails; X-2, however, sneaks his first ball
into very close position. (At this junc-
ture, Team A has two balls left, both
A-3’s; Team X has three left—X-2’s
second and X-3’s pair.)

Bowler A-3 (the anchor man is usu-
ally the captain or “brains” of a team)
now decides to knock away the oppo-
nents’ “counter” ball. Taking aim, he
“shoots” his first ball at full volley and

a pocket hit by C ball, white can score with A. In #6, gent-
ly hitting the jack ball forward as imlicaterl, white can score his
A and B for 2 points. This maneuver calls for precise skill

since white must loft his C ball high, thus moving I far enough
ahead to score 2 points. Pushing I too hard would cause it
to bounce back to black again.

293

makes a direct hit on the offending ball,
removing it from scoring position. His
ball. meanwhile, also ricochets out of
play, but his teammate A-2’s ball has
been left once again as the closest coun-
ter . . . and once again, it is up to Team
X to retake the advantage.

With his second ball, however, X-2
fails to “point” closer. Next, X-3, try-
ing in his turn to shoot away the win-
ning A ball, misses both times. At this
stage, Team X has bowled all its balls;
Team A already has one “closest” ball
for one point; and A-3 still has one ball
left to bowl. The latter, sighting care-
fully since there are now eleven balls
surrounding the jack at varying dis-
tances, manages to nudge his second
ball in as another closer counter. At the
end of this first “inning,” then, A has
two of its balls closer to the jack than

any of X’s—and thus the score is A:2,
X:0.

SECOND INNING: As winner of the pre-
cedingninning, Team A again leads off
in the second inning, with A-I marking
the circle, tossing out the jack, and
bowling the first ball—which this time
comes to rest far short. With his first
ball, X-l points a “toucher”—-—right up
against the jack. Team A then uses up
all five of its remaining balls trying to
shoot this toucher away or to get in,
as protective defense, at least a fairly
close ball. And now Team X, with one
winning point already assured, can try
to make hay with its remaining five
halls—and manages with care to roll

A. At the end of Inning 2, the score:
Az2; X:5.

GAME: So it continues, through how-
ever many innings are necessary, until
one team has scored thirteen points,
which is “Game.” In regulation play,
a meeting between two teams normally
consists of three successive games, the
first two to thirteen points, the latter
(as often happens, the tie-breaker) to
fifteen points. After the first game in a
series, the lead-off team of the next is
the one that has lost the preceding
game. In social play, game score of
nine or eleven or twenty-one points may
be preagreed, and often is (for some

ment in the field of park design since
Olmsted laid out Central Park in New
York City before the turn of the cen-
tury. Is this good? Isithealthy? \Vhat
if the educators were still providing the
same type school plans typical of the
1890 era? Can we afford to stake our
reputation, our professional status—
our very being—on the park facilities
available today? Even though some of
us would like to think of programs as
our sustenance, the park is still our
“plant,” and it stands continually in
the public eye as the symbol of our pro-
fession.

WHAT CAN we D0 to improve this
situation? The answer lies in the
development of an effective planning
program. It is granted that the plan-
ning function alone cannot provide the
magical cure for all the ills of the pro-
fession. However, a comprehensive
planning effort by administrators and
officials at all levels would do much to
counteract the apathy and conservative
obstructionism that vitallv affects the
efficiency of our program. I wish to
differentiate between the term planning
as used in this context and the design.
Design is the physical arrangement of
materials to produce a functional struc-
ture or facility. Planning is the practi-
cal arrangement of people and services
to produce the organization. support.
and talent necessary to effect the ulti-
mate design.

We have only to look at the majority
of park facilities throughout the coun-
try today to recognize some of the com-
mon pitfalls affecting the proper design
of those facilities. The “lrislnnan’s
shanty” appearance of many recreation
areas is usually caused by piecemeal ad-

  

ditions of individual units without first
ascertaining the basic elements of de-
sign, such as inter-relationships. func-
tion, architectural style, landscaping.
circulation, transition zones, and color
applications. How many of us have lo-
cated a baseball backstop on a new
piece of ground to service a volunteer
youth program, using the most level
portion of the site as our onlv guide to
Or possibly, the water
meter was located at a particular corner
and we only had enough pipe on hand
to extend the sprinkler system to a cer-
tain location? Or, the people living
next to the park objected to the noise
and we located the ball diamond on the
opposite side of the park. Or possibly,
the kids had already started playing
ball and we merely put the backstop in
back of their home plate.

Today, the park and recreation pro-
fessional is facing the greatest challenge
of his short history. Not only must he

provide the leadership and guidance for
constructing a comprehensive and ever-
increasing program to fill the recreation
needs of his individual community, but
he must also assume the leadership in
development of adequate and useful
recreation areas and facilities. The old
adage “Too Little, Too Late" could well
be applied to the current status of park
properties.

The types of prOperty and their loca-
tion in the community are too often dic-
tated by factors other than sound recre-
ation planning, and the areas that are
acquired are seldom large enough to ac-
connnodate the comprehensive facilities
needed. lncreasing costs of mainten-
ance and operation, the ever-changing
program content. as well as the preva-
lent trend in private and commercial ar-

chitecture, which graphically illustrates
the public demand for attractive areas
and facilities, are only a few of the con-
ditions that demand from us proper
planning and design of all park areas.

RECREATION AREAS which are poorly
designed or carelessly developed
and maintained, invariably fail to per-
form their intended functions and can-
not possibly produce a satisfactory re-
turn on investment. This fact not only
impairs the effectiveness of the recrea-
tion program, but what is often more
important, this condition will influence
and discourage the support of the pub-
lic, the elected officials and administra-
tive heads for the provision of addition-
al facilities and services.

ADMINISTRATION

Another common pitfall is the lack
of complete understanding between the
professional designers, elected oHicials,
and recreation administrators. Factors
relative to engineering limitations, com-
patibility of design features, inter-rela-
tionship of structural units are not ne-
cessarily familiar terms to the park and
recreation professional. Public accept-
ance, group pressure, inadequate finan-
cing, the responsibility for increases of
maintenance and operation costs, or the
problem of programing, supervision
and housekeeping cannot always be dis-
cussed on common ground with the pro-

fessional designer.

Very often decisions are made rela-
tive to the type of construction, its lay-

istrator. He may be a boy-girl counselor, parent confidant,
and frequently an arbiter in the quarrels and differences of
youth. When gala occasions are planned, the successful
pool director assumes a role of weather prophet and, as
these social events are conducted, this meteorological master
controls winds, rain, and water temperature.

While it is recommended that the swimming pool monarch
should not be burdened with simple, routine duties, he often
finds himself patrolling the premises for stray cigarette fil-
ters, cast-off candy wrappers, and smuggled but forgotten
suntan lotions, for among cardinal rules of his kingdom
is good housekeeping. Sometimes he is policeman enforcing
traflic rules for swimmers, divers, and those who forget and
run on slippery decks. Oftentimes he is a detective tracking
down errant thieves who have lifted bracelets, pants, pan-
ties, and swim caps.

This man wearing the sun helmet and whistle is teacher,
hero, ogre, and warden. On paydays he is blessed by the
lifeguards, but more often they deem him a demanding,
dogmatic taskmaster, admitting, however, that he is a
conscientious guardian of public lives. To the nursery set
in the wading pool he is Santa Claus with a pack full of
joyful play activities, but at times it would appear that he
is chief babysitter for unappreciated or unwanted children.
Teenagers regard him as they do their school principal——
a spoiler who does not understand the methods and tech-
niques of having fun. Very often the manager is equally
unpopular with the interscholastic coach because the pool
is verboten as a farm operation for the high-school swim
team.

Among the practical arts applied by the proficient aquatic
authority are those of landscaper, repairman, and filtration
expert. When obnoxious algae multiply, he is both alchemist
and high priest dispensing magic formulas. praying the
water clears and toxic conditions do not develop. If admis-
sion tickets are sold, the pool chief is auditor and banker,
and, when shortages occur, bondsman. He is an articulate
conversationalist or stoically uncommunicative depending
on the pool load, political status of his companion, or the

attractiveness of the other party if a member of the distafl.
Despite the numerous burdens, variety of skills required,

and bewildering challenges of the job, the pool manager

enjoys his labors because he is in the swim of things! #

CALIFORNIA. Dedication of the $900,000 Venice Fish-
ing Pier in Los Angeles took place on February 27. The
3,100-foot-long pier was financed with matching funds
from the California State Wildlife Conservation Board and
the Los Angeles City Recreation and Parks Department.
Built to meet the needs of the sports fisherman, it spans
from the beachhead into open waters, ending in a 120-
foot-diameter fishing platform. The pier has twelve indi-
vidual fishing stations and stands twenty-seven feet above
the low water line. The facility is equipped with sanitary

stations, and ample parking space at the shore end of the
pier.

MICHIGAN. An organization known as the Michigan
Association of Rural Recreation Enterprises was formed
recently to promote the conversion of farmlands to tourist
resorts and recreation areas. Association Chairman John
Bintz said “there are pitfalls” in dealing with the public,
but the association can help by organizing a library of
references on how to start a campsite, or how to set up a
fishing area and so on. Governor George Romney has
asserted there is a need for expanded state farm facilities.
Mr. Bintz said farmers have the land and they often have
land near urban areas. It was pointed out that with farm
prices declining, sources of additional income for farmers
become more and more attractive. Recreation conversion
even offers a chance to make money on land which is un-

productive with food crops; Some aims of the association
are:

0 To foster and maintain high standards in recreation fa-
cilities and services; encourage and promote adequate
programs of education and training for rural recreation
entrepreneurs.

0 Cooperate with all international, national and state pro-
fessional and service organizations and governmental agen-
cies for similar or related objectives; and to produce
publications for dissemination of information concerning
the activities and interests of the association.

MINNESOTA. Sale of a $5,000,000 bond issue for acqui-'

sition of land for recreation purposes was authorized by

298

the Hennepin County Park Reserve District. The
State Legislature authorized the county park distr' j

sell up to $8,000,000 worth of bonds. Last year the dis .
board sold the first $3,000,000 in bonds.

Under present conditions, suburban Hennepin C 1
would be obligated to pay off the bonds. However, if
neapolis becomes a part of the park reserve distr' I
would assume its proportionate share of the bonds. i
Minneapolis could do this, it would have to have t .

proval of the City Council and the district’s board.

   

MISSOURI. Visitors to Missouri state parks and hi

sites totaled a record 9,492,448 persons last year, acco '
to State Parks Director Lee C. Fine, who says there
755,860 more visitors in 1964 than in 1963. If thi

centage of increase continues, Mr. Fine declares, ther
be more than 10,000,000 visitors this year.

OHIO. A $100,000,000 plan to develop Ohio’s full pot

of outdoor resources over the next six years was anno .
recently by Director Fred E. Morr of the State Natur
sources Department. The plan, as worked out by the St

Engineering Company of Cleveland,\calls for improve

in all state parks, wildlife areas, state forests, wate
facility improvements, and reclamation of lands. Fun
be used include $25,000,000 from the $250,000,000

issue approved by Ohio voters last May; $30,000,0
bonds to be submitted to the voters next May; $12,0 l
in waterway safety funds; $1,000,000 from wildlife f

$4,500,000 out of highway funds for park roads; $4,00
from general revenue and fee accounts, such as docks,
cessions, leases, and rentals; and $29,000,000 from fe
land and water conservation funds.

‘PENNSYLVANIA. A formula under which $20,0

would be allocated to 451 municipalities and counties
ing to participate in Pennsylvania’s Project 70 land a
sition program has been announced by the State Com
Department’s Bureau of Community Development. Th

SOME TIME the Department of

New York, has been experi-
; lg with various types of wood in

: is responsible for over two hun-
benches located throughout the

Subsequently, because of the con-
. repair, loss of inanhours, and ex-
of replacements, new methods and
ials were mandatory.
r s and experiments began on all
and sizes of wood. Oak, Western
- l redwood were tried on outside

or the same period of time. Some
benches consist of l”-by-3” slats,
. 2”-by-4" slats, some with 2”-by-
nks, and for special areas, 3”-by-
nks are used. Also, included were
' le bleachers which are 2”-by-10”

After discovering this wood, we dis—

length of wood was sent to us and we
made the following tests with a 2”-by-
6”-by-7’ length of jarrah:

Test: The wood was subjected to the
flame of a welding torch for three min-
utes. The flame was only an inch away

from the wood.

Result: Wood did not burn completely.
only charred slightly, and the heat of
the flame did not penetrate through the
two-inch thickness of jarrah.

Test: A hole was drilled into the jarrah
board with a high-Speed drill press.
using a half-inch bit.

Result:The wood can be drilled, but
only with high-speed drills. Any kind
of slow-speed drill used on this wood
would possibly result in the burning

and dullng of the bit.
Test: Nailsol all sizes. including 6"-by-
'1” small spikes were hammered into

the wood.

Result: Not even the. spikes penetrated
more than half an inch before bending
or breaking. Wood is very dillicult to

nail. Holes must be drilled and secured
by nuts and bolts.

Test: All types of saws were used in
an attempt to see if the wood could be
cut.

Result: The wood can be cut by saw,
but lland cutting is very dillicult. With
a power saw, a smooth and good cut
can be made without any dilliculty.
Test: A newly sharpened axe was used
to see if the wood could be chopped.

Result: You can chop this wood but
it is very hard to make any cut unless
great strength and a sharp edge are
used. It will not split when being
chopped, nor does it splinter.

Test: Weights were placed on the plank
and the small cub tractor was driven
onto the wood.

Result: The strength of this board is
tremendous. Over a ton was placed on
one plank, at one time, over a five-foot
suspension and it did not even bend.

W e feel, because of the strenwth and
D

durability of jarrah, it would be expedi-
ent for us to convert all of our benches
and bleachers to this type of wood.
There would be no painting; it would
be virtually maintenance free; and life
eXpectancy would be much greater than
other woods. The initial purchase may
cost a penny or two more per lineal foot
but over a period of time, in repair
work alone, jarrah would be much more.
economical. By doing this, expendi-
tures would be the same, considering
not buying paint and saving on man-
hours for repair and replacement.

For anyone who is responsible for

benches, bleachers, or any type of fa-
cility that uses wood. it would be bene-
ficial to investigate the possibilities of
using jarrah. More information can be
obtained by writing to Creenheart De-

COPIES of a new brochure outlining
action programs designed to “re-
store, develop, and protect” Washing-
ton’s landscape were presented to Mrs.
Lyndon B. Johnson recently. The
strikingly attractive brochure, prepared
by the National Capital Region of the
National Park Service, was presented
to Mrs. Johnson and her Committee for
Beautification of the National Capital
by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L.
Udall on behalf of National Park Serv-
ice Director George B. Hartzog, Jr.

Entitled National Capital Landscape,
the publication contains the National
Capital Region’s plans for making
Washington more beautiful, meaning-
ful and liveable. Envisioning the na-
tion’s capital as “A City of Flowers,”
the Park Service proposes plans for
floral displays in 116 new park areas in
accord with the First Lady’s statement
that “masses of flowers ought to be
planted where masses of people see
them.” As a result of beautifying Wash-
ington’s parklands, it is hoped that
private individuals and organizations
will make their own contributions of
floral beauty to the city.

Canoe Area Rules

CONTROLS on the million-acre “canoe

area” within the Superior Na-
tional Forest, on the Minnesota-Ontario
border, are being tightened by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture. Secretary
Orville L. Freeman announced in a
press interview that this is to protect
the wilderness aspect of the area and
will include the reservation of some
lakes for canoes exclusively and the lim-
iting of the use of power boats on oth-
ers. Lakes will be zoned for these pur-

poses. A special citizens committee

preservation of the area as the white
man first saw it. Secretary Freeman
also announced recently that he will

Citizen Action

Needed in New York -

THE GREAT NEED for a recreation de-
partment in New York City has
again been discussed, this time at an
all-day annual conference of the Plan-
ning Department, School of Architec-
ture, Pratt Institute in that city. The
topic as announced in the printed pro-
gram was “Parks in New York City’s

Future.” Additional sponsors were:
Citizens Housing and Planning Council
of New York; New York Metropolitan
Chapter, American Institute of Plan-
ners; and the Regional Plan Associa-
tion. The National Recreation Associa-
tion was among the cosponsors.

It was agreed at the conference,
among other things, that a recreation
department is greatly needed by the
city, but there seems to be some confu-
sion among local organizations as to
how to undertake getting it. Public rec-
reation programs and facilities in the
city are now provided by numerous de-
partments, especially the park depart-
ment, board of education, and welfare
department. It was suggested that the
city planning commission and the city
administration should be pressured.
Mrs. Carol Greitzer, vice-president of
the Council for Parks and Playgrounds,
held that what New York needs is a
citizens’ committee, and a central place
where citizens and city oflicials can sit
down together and discuss needs. She
stated that local groups have been prod-
ding the city park department, but the
latter has resisted the approaches of the
people rather than inviting them.

Thomas Van Sant, assistant superin-
tendent of the Bureau of Community
Education, suggested that if you want
to do something now for recreation and
parks, you can appear at public hear-
ings and let the authorities know that
your group is concerned. He said that
the board of education works with many
local groups.

Conrad Wirth, former director of the
National Park Service and now consult-
ant to Laurance Rockefeller, said that
what we need in New York is a series
of recreation spaces, and more people
watching places. “Certainly the land is
valuable,” he said, “but what about the
value we place on human beings?

“I suggest every fifth block be set
aside in our cities, all buildings be re-
moved from it. and turned into a recre-
ation area.”

0 THE SHELTERED LIFE. Need a canopy to shade a wading
pool, protect a summer art exhibit, or a sandbox out in the
open sun? A whole collection of new canvas designs includes
soaring cones of canvas, graceful fabric arcs, and colorful
moving domes. Combined with rope and easy-to-shape
aluminum pipe, the fabric can be formed into a variety of
styles.

For instance, canvas segments lashed to a metal frame
create the colorful dome of shade. The segments are at-
tached to a center pole and travel on a channel track at
the base. They meet or overlap to adjust to the needs for
privacy or comfort. A graceful Camelot pavilion of canvas,
decorated with tassels and a crenelated valance, is made
with ribs of rope and a wide circle of aluminum, hung from
a supporting center pole.

Giant canvas petals in pastel tints can create a fanciful
pavilion for beach, patio, or picnic area. The petals are sup-
ported by four metal pipes embedded in large flower pots,
and joined together at the center to form a full-blown blos—
som of shade. Smaller patches of shade can be created with
single petals protecting garden seats or other outdoor nooks.
A simple shading device can be made with elongated tri-
angles of‘ canvas reaching from ground stakes to a con-
venient overhead tree limb. A rope threaded along sleeves
in two sides of each triangle runs from the ground stakes
to tree to support the shelter.

Today, canvas is an improved fabric with more durable,
weather-resistant finishes and with brighter, faster colors.
This year’s collection of decorator hues cuts across the
entire color spectrum from azure to peacock green and from
flamenco red to citron. There is variety, too, in the 1965
selection of prints and stripes. There are big, bold bands
of color, small ribbons of various hues, regimental stripes.
Roman stripes, and many other combinations, including
plaids and ‘checks and even floral designs.

a EVER TRY TO BATHE AN ELEPHANT—especially when he
invites some of his friends to go dunking with him? While
it is quite common for many households to run out of hot
water during peak load periods because of undersized water
heaters, the city of Monroe, Louisiana, makes sure its city
zoo is adequately supplied. For the elephant pool—in which
the hippopotamus and tapir also share bath-time— a 670,-
000 BTU/hr gasifired copper coil commercial water heater
has been installed. This BC670 model (or BP67F for pools)
can heat 643 gallons per hour at 100 degree rise. As the
pool water is not recirculated, there must be a steady and
dependable supply of warm water to mix with fresh water

in keeping the pool clean as well as at a constant tempera-
ture of 65 degrees.

Safety on wheels. A new little booklet designed
to help increase the pleasure, enjoyment, and
safety of the nation's 57,000,000 bicyclists,
provides a new and positive approach to the
bicycle-safety story. It is intended for use by
groups concerned with making their communi-
ties a safer place—such as police departments,
safety and health organizations, Bay and Girl
Scout troops, business and professional groups,
citizens' associations, motor vehicle departments,
schools, PTA's, service clubs, women's organiza-
tions, recreation, pork and playground directors,
bicycle clubs, et cetero. About Bicycles is ovoila-
ble far $.25 from Charming L. Bete Company,
Greenfield, Massachusetts, 01301. (Bulk prices
range from $.05 ta $.15 per copy depending
on quantity.)
e

Music in action. The Caraba-Cone method of
sensory-motor approach to music reading and
rhythm employs traditional children’s games to
teach music fundamentals. Their use is clearly
explained and well illustrated in a new booklet,
The Carabo-Cane Method in Action. Recreation
leaders will find the ideas and materials easily
odoptoble as recreation activities. The booklet

 

 

is available for $1.50 from the National Recre-
ation Association Recreation Baak Center, 8
West 8th Street, New York 10011. Additional
materials can be found in Mrs. Cane's previous

The tidal marshes occupy only a mi-
nute fraction of the continental United
States. Most of the West Coast and por-
tions of the East are formed of steep
rocky shores or eroding headlands. The
marshes are found in the estuaries and
the bays sheltered by barrier beaches
and islands, especially southward along
the gently sloping Atlantic Coastal
plain.

Have you ever taken a low altitude
flight along the coast within the limits
of the megalopolis (i.e. between Port-
land, Mainc, and Norfolk, Virginia)?
It can he an alarming experience if one

understands the biological significance

Channels and basin are carved

streams and outfall sewers, and bay
after bay is filled with fantastic num-
bers of pleasure craft. This attack on
the tidal marsh is twofold—direct phy-
sical encroachment, due in large part to
hydraulic dredging and filling opera-
tions, and indirect damage through pol-
lution of the water. H

In these days of an exploding popula-
tion we t-lluuld, as a nation, be giving
thour"l to the food resources of the
future. It is often glibly said that when
the going gets rough we turn to the
vast resources of the sea. It is time the
public became enlightened with respect
to the role of the salt marsh in marine
productivity, lest in a few more careless
years we destroy an important potential
of the sea. Productivity may be mea-
sured by the amount of plant growth
supported by a given surface of the
planet, as plants provide the base of the

ONE MAY appropriately ask the sig-
nificance of these statistics for hu-

man nutrition when we eat none of this
plant material ourselves and now rarely
even bother to harvest the salt hay. The
answer lies in the production of high
protein food sources which may be
harvested in the estuaries and offshore
waters. It was no accident that relatively
high concentrations of aborigines in
pre-Colonial times were found along the
seacoast. The decaying organic mate-
rial that is daily flushed from the salt
marsh by the ebbing tide is the base

 

Youngsters explore the mysterious world of the marsh. Many marine species through
millions of years have developed a life cycle dependent upon the shallow, protected,
fertile habitat of estuary streams that thread the salt marshes aml nearby bays.

food chain that nourishes animals and
man. Deserts and the vast open oceans
are the least productive, only producing
a little over one pound per acre per day.
Comparable figures for coastal waters,
shallow lakes, grasslands and ordinary
croplands range between six and sixty
pounds per acre per day, while estu-
aries, tidal marshes and unusually fer-
tile lands under intensive cultivation
produce between sixty and 242 pounds
per acre per day. Thus, these soggy
coastal wetlands, twice daily irrigated
by the nutrients of the sea, produce as
much new organic matter, with no ex-
penditure of human effort, as our rich-
est, most intensively worked farms.

of a complex food chain in the little
streams that thread it and then in the
adjacent bays. 0f great importance are
the spawning and nursing grounds of
the tom cod, flounder, menhaden and
other species that through millions of
years have developed a life cycle de—
pendent upon the shallow, protected and
fertile habitat of the estuary. Some of
these fish later go to sea and provide
food for tuna, bass, and swordfish. The
destruction of these marshes will cer-
tainly have a most unfavorable impact
upon the productivity of the offshore
waters, to say nothing of shellfish which
are supported by the estuarine habitat.

Many species of migratory waterfowl

are. of course, completely depeu
upon the marshes and estuaries
feeding and resting grounds along
Atlantic Flyway. The annual harve
ducks can hardly be considered a
nificant source of human food at
present time, but these birds hav
enormous importance to million
sportsmen and bird watchers. As

goes on, the proportion of ornitholo
and camera fans to hunters will g
whether or not this recreation reso
is preserved, but it is surely to be b
that the base that supports this f
and the enjoyment that it provides
not be destroyed.

There are other values to the C
wetlands. In places they provide
protection to the shore from er
and to the water table from contan
tion by salt water. In a somewhat
tive way they serve the public far b
as a marsh than as a development
ject to periodic flooding by hurri
tides. It is time we learned that
whole society suffers from ill-ad\
developments that disregard the na
laws that govern our environment.

ues. The legislation giving the state
government this power should be stud-
ied carefully by conservationists in
other states. Zoning tidal marshes
against real-estate development is an-
other type of action that should be con-
sidered, especially in areas vulnerable
to periodic flooding by hurricane tides,
and citizens must be alert to oppose
encroachments on public lands.‘Marshes
in state parks, for example, have been

destroyed for reasons of financial or

 

the age tolerance for team sports.
“Highly competitive team sports can
create a vacuum of unskilled, unin-
terested, dissatisfied, and disgruntled
youth. Such sports (predominantly
slanted to boys) make a significant
drain on public funds in municipal
recreation, schools, and institutions.

Many require CXpensive equipment,
expensive facilities, expensive transpor-
tation, and high related insurance
charges. There is usually a high injury
risk. These sports satisfy the few par-
ticipants and avid fans, but the great
youthful majority are forced to be spec-
tators or are left to find other pursuits
or ‘kicks’ without meaningful leader-
ship, due to a lack of interest, status, or
support. We are developing the ‘herd’
instinct at a time when youth logically
needs encouragement towards individu-

The growing concern on the part of
government and citizen groups for the

have been given the power to police

should not be sponsoring the exception;
rather, it should be servicing the multi-

“Greater long-term values for the in-
dividual and youth are served by a
broad and practical support of indi-
vidual sports and activities, skills that
are useful to men and women even in
retirement, such as golf, curling, swim-
ming, badminton, tennis, sailing, arts
and crafts, canoeing, skiing, snow-shoe-
ing, painting, reading, music apprecia-

awakening a sense of civic and social

Continued from Page 271

 

To date this conflict has been one-
sided. The people who promise immed-
iate economic benefit are usually more
persuasive than the ones who talk in
terms of intangible and esthetic values.
Because of the apparent rewards in-
volved, our forebears were willing to
tolerate mass destruction of wildlife,
forests, and topsoil. For the same rea-
son, we are willing to overlook reckless
destruction of our tidal marshes today.
It would be interesting to know how
future generations will feel towards us
for dredging and filling tidemarsh
areas, altering irrevocably an environ-
ment that is as much theirs as ours.—

Director, Marine Research Foundation,

Swamps Can Save Cities

OUR HIGHLY URBAN communities in
the East can only be “saved” if
we save the surrounding swamps and

seashores and historic sites that are, in
reality, the lungs of our urban masses.
Will life have any real meaning unless
we preserve the best of our countryside?

And what is happening to our East
Coast swamps? Admittedly, we don’t
have many five-thousand-acre Great
Swamps [as in Morris County, New
Jersey] lying around for the asking or
the taking. But up and down the East-
ern seaboard we do have a plethora of
little swamps. Perhaps they are only
five hundred acres, but within those
five hundred acres, waterfowl nest,
shrimp and clams live happily, even
swimmers can find an occasional deep
for splashing and ducking.

To put this into terms which are most
meaningful to a citizenry more and
more preoccupied with how to use its
leisure time, what does your life—your
environment—your society mean to
you? When you get to the estuary,
what difference does it make‘that there
was an eight-lane, sixty-five MPH high-
way to speed you there if there is no
swimming, no clamming—none of the
texture-type of thing which gives qual-

OR THE ILL 86 HANDICAPPED

Morton Thompson, Ed.D.

very little has been done recreationally
for the profoundly retarded the project
is, to a large extent, an experimental
one.

Evaluation records are being kept by
the staff on a daily basis. These con-
cem items such as interest, awareness,
capabilities, participation, muscle con-
trol, comprehension, communication,
and socialization. Special records are
being compiled in the areas of locomo-
tion and coordination, manipulation
and social needs. As the program de-
velops, increasingly difficult or complex
activities will be added to the program.
A guide will be produced to help other
institutions housing the profoundly re-
tarded.

The results, even during this first
year, have been remarkable. The resi-
dents are less destructive, more atten-
tive, and look forward eagerly to their
daily activities as well as to the visit of
the recreation staff. The atmosphere of
the cottages is bright, active, and one
could say even happy.

4* Meyer Schreiber, now a consultant
on social services to the mentally re-
tarded with the U.S. Children’s Bureau,
recently received a much deserved cita-
tion and bronze plaque from the New
York City Chapter of the Association
for the Help of Retarded Children, for
his many efforts and contributions in
social work, recreation, and camping
with the mentally retarded. These in-
clude the development of a well-
rounded program of group work recre-
ation and camp services for the mentally
retarded, development of the first Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health grant
dealing with community recreation re-
sources for the mentally retarded, con-
ducting several professional institutes
dealing with recreation and camping
and authorship and editing of many
publications and articles in the field.

ERRATUM

In the April 1965 issue of RECREA-
TION, the “Research Briefs” section car-
rics my summary of a research study
undertaken by Ruth Marson, graduate
student at New York University, in co-
operation with the National Recreation
Association and the National Associa-
tion for Retarded Children. The study
surveyed two thousand public recrea-
tion departments to determine the ex-
tent and type of services provided the
mentally retarded and the physically
handicapped in the community setting.

  

Quite unintentionally, the summary
in RECREATION gave rise to misunder-
standings as to who conducted this
study, and we are very sorry. It was
conducted by Miss Marson and the
statements of results as given in the
magazine summary are abstracted from
her master’s thesis, “Public Recreation
Programs for the III and Handicapped
in Selected Communities.”

We have been most interested in the
findings of this study. Data provided
needed information on the methods of
administration, transportation, finan-
cial support, and supervision of the
programs.

 
 
   
   
   
 
     
   
   
 
    
 
   
 
  
   
 
 
  
 

RECREATION, LEISURE,
AND POLITICS

By ARNOLD GREEN, formerly of The
Pennsylvania State University. 220
pages, $5.95.

A penetrating essay which expounds the
idea that as modern industrial society
develops in the United States, the gov-
ernment—particularly the Federal gov-
ernment—is limited as the appropriate
agency to direct and control the recre-
ation and leisure of its citizens.

I Analyzes the authoritarian drift im-
plicit in a variety of government pro-
grams.

I Describes how some professional rec-
reationists and “intellectuals of utopian
bent" have cooperated to demand co-
ercion of the use of the “new leisure"
and government interference with the
market in commercial entertainment.

I Utilizes literary and historical mate-
rials, including the work of modern intel-
lectuals such as Krutch, Fiedler, Bell,
Rosten, Huxley, and Riesman.

Arnold W. Green. McGraw-Hill, 330
West 42nd Street, New York l0036.
Pp. 193. $5.95.

SOCIOLOGIST Arnold W. Green here

seeks to analyze the relevant issues
on leisure, recreation, and work. His
main theme is, that as modern society
deve10ps in the United States, the gov-
ernment—particularly the federal gov-
ernment—~is limited as the appropriate
agency to direct and control recreation
and leisure for its citizens.

Government, unlike business, has ex-
tended control. That control, in reac-
tion to the most extensive pressure of
votes, is exercised with the hit-and-run
tactics of the wildcatter. The question
is raised: Is the greatest good, then,
what the greatest number want? If not,
should the greatest good of future gen-
erations take precedence over the pres-
ent? If material welfare weighs more
than spiritual welfare, should preserva-
tion of natural resources be given pref-
erence over natural beauty?

In discussing the uses of state and na-
tional parks, it is pointed out that the
very segments of our urban p0pu1ation,
which are often referred to as being the
greatest need for such outdoor areas, do
not want them, according to some sur-
veys. The deduction was made that the
services are maintained by all taXpay-
ers for the benefit of the relatively well-
to-do. (No doubt this ratio will be re-
duced as the programs bring the na-
tional recreation areas closer to the pop-
ulation center deveIOpments.)

Three considerations in the matter of
establishing standards are given by the
author: “First, needs, especially recre-
ation needs, are highly individualized.
As eXperienced, they are not needs at
all, but wants or desires or preferences.
Second, the means to be utilized are re-
sources available for want-satisfaction
are scarce. Third, and most important,
how are standards of adequacy (for
how many? for all?) to be set and by
whom?” Mr. Green points out that to
many writers in the field of public rec-
reation “need” and “adequate” appear
to be purely arbitrary judgmentsabout
what other people should want and have.

Mr. Green’s essay is interesting read-
ing if one does not mind his rambling
manner. He points to the hazards of
trying to forego the recreation interests
of other persons as well as discussing
fully the relationship between delin-

quency and organized recreation. He
points out the meaning which any given

310

situation has for an individual, which
ultimately determines what his reaction
to or action within that situation is go-
ing to be. It is stated that, as a rule,
delinquents have been found to be more
athletic, physically stronger, and more
skilled at games than nondelinquents.
These observations, of course, have
great implications for those providing
organized recreational programs.

Mr. Green questions whether the pro—
posed four-day work week would be a
promise or a threat. We may not get
tangible rewards that are necessary for
the individual and the community. He
states, “Play has not become, and shows
no signs of becoming, an emergent
means for uniting the neighborhood
and the community.” It would appear
to me, however, that this would depend
upon the leadership, type of program,
and motives back of the individual’s
participation.

Some of the author’s VieWpoints are
controversial and contrary to prevalent
points of view held by many of the top
recreators. However, it is desirable
reading for professional people, and I
am sure many will find the book inter-
esting and stimulating as well as pro-
vocative.—-Robert W. Crawford, Com-
missioner of Recreation, Philadelphia.

sets, advertisements, tickets, and other
details, this spiralbound book does not
teach swim strokes or choreography.
It assumes that swimming skills are
adequate. It defines the steps involved
in production in terms of goals to be
strived for and materials necessary to
accomplish these goals. It emphasizes
participation, not only in the perform-
ances but in the planning.

To accomplish this, the author out-
lines three pageants in great detail. One
is built around a twelve-scene produc-
tion, each scene on a monthly theme.
Another is built around various states,
on a sort of travel theme. The third is
more of a variety show. Various scenes
from all three could be elaborated on
or combined into different themes, since
each is outlined in great detail, giving
