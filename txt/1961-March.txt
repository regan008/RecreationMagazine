On The Cover

The growing pressures of urbaniza-
tion make our outdoor recreation areas
more precious than ever before. Old
and young are seeking surcease from
brick and stone, concrete and asphalt,
by turning to the wilderness, to the sea,
to the mountains, to the fields for a
change of pace, 3 change of spirit.
These boys with their sailboat know the
peace that a day upon the water can
bring. Photograph courtesy British In-
formation Services, New York City.

Next Month

The April issue will be devoted to
playgrounds and will include: a salute
to Hawaii fired on the playgrounds of
Tacoma, Washington; a zoo Wagon de-
veloped by Evansville, Indiana; new
activities for the summer program; an
armadillo of a nature program in Aus-
tin, Texas; and summer matinee pro-
grams in Los Angeles. In addition, you
will read how playground equipment
proceeds from dream to drawing board
in Garden Grove, California; about a
church summer recreation program in
Memphis, Tennessee; and a riding pro-
gram in Pompano Beach, Florida. A
provocative editorial by Charles K.
Brightbill on creativeness will give you

pause for thought and food for reflec-
tion.

Let’s Keep Camping in the Camp

THE TIME-WORN and somewhat am-
biguous statement that “camping
means many things to many people”
seems to afford a rationalization for
dubious activities in the field of camp-
ing. In fact, it indicates that camping
lacks uniqueness as well as the other
specific values which have motivated so
many men and women to devote lifetimes of thought and
effort to providing opportunities for children to have re-
warding camping experiences. It almost suggests that the
label of camping can be applied to any individual concept
without regard for the well-established camping movement.
Evidence of this may readily be seen in visiting some so-
called “camps.”

Good camping not only carefully avoids duplication and
extension of usual urban activities, but deliberately plans
to do a goodly proportion of things which cannot be done
in a city environment. Unfortunate is the camp director
who, through lack of know-how and experience in camping
practices and techniques, seeks to meet competition for the
active or leisure time of youth with the same program and
activities of his urban competitor. It is difficult to believe
that camping has lost its imaginative and wholesome po-
tentialities, that a camp director or organization executive
in defense of noncamping activities in his camp needs to
say, “I have to give my campers what their parents de-
mand.” Such a statement infers a lack of knowledge and
faith in camping, a dearth of salesmanship and initiative,
and may even imply a motivation akin to something other
than that in camping.

 

ACTUALLY, camping is universal. It affords no room for
compromise. The past decade has witnessed a veri-
table avalanche of individual and organized camping en-
thusiasts both in the United States and abroad. For veri-
fication of this fact, one only needs to review state and
federal park and forest reports indicating their use by some
twelve million persons in one season alone (1959). Review
the record of sales of camping equipment reaching into the
billion dollar bracket. There are no less than six monthly
national magazines and literally hundreds of books pub-
lished expressly on the theme of camping. Witness the
steady increase of all types of organized camps, agency,
private, church, school, day, family, travel, etcetera, serving
well over five million campers in 1960.
The interesting fact of this .phenomenal growth 'is the
steady development of, and adherence to, a basic core of

-.-_.—

camping. Church camps are emerging from conferences to
multiple-purpose camps with emphasis on camping. Day
camps are summer fun clubs unless they provide campingJ
Travel camps are tours only if they do not experience camp-
ing along the way. The trend is toward certified campcraft I
personnel on organized camping staffs. (Over two thousand .
persons have qualified by American Camping Association’s l
standards for this important task in the past two years.)
Universities and colleges are teaching and granting credit!
for camping courses.

ORGANIZED CAMPING no longer can be generalized asl
“many things.” It is not a conglomeration of activities
operated outdoors by anybody irrespective of training, ex-
perience, character, and motivation. It is rapidly taking.
its place among state licensed professions. Camping stand- .
ards have gone beyond the areas of safety, health, and sani-
tation, and are now applied to personnel, administration,
and program. Camping is gaining stature and recognition
for what it is—a way of life conducive to the best in learn-
ing, appreciation, and personal growth. “Let’s go camping”
is an invitation to young and old, individual or organized
group to temporarily drop the yoke of urban living. It is
a dare to do without the “plush” and a challenge to self-
reliance. It anticipates something new or different. It is
earthy, it is woodsy, it is natural. Yet there are those who
would exploit camping as there are those who have ex-
ploited our natural resources. There are those who, from
lack of camping knowledge would transport the city to the
woods.

Life’s greatest values are derived from many sources,
and each source justifiably promotes and proclaims its con-
tribution to these values. Certain life values derived from
church, home, and school have been justifiably attributed
to camping. The differentiation, however, comes from the
unique contribution that camping makes to these values,
rather than the duplication or intensification of the same
experiences to be had in the church, home, school, or any
other urban relationship. The “camp” that teaches democ-
racy, fair play, self-reliance, or that provides opportunity
for spiritual growth, education, and human relationships
does not provide a camping experience merely because it
contains these values. It is the unique way in which it
teaches and provides experiences that determines whether-
or not it is a camping camp. It is probably safe to say that§
no single value is totally derived from just one source.
Camping proudly joins other sources, such as home; church,
school, youth organizations and agencies, as one of the great
contributing sources to the values of life. Camping will re-
tain its reorganized professional place among these con-
tributing sources so long as it maintains its separate identity Q

and adheres to the techniques and uniqueness peculiar to
camping, including campcraft, nature lore, nature crafts,
etcetera. Camps confining their programs solely to activi-
ties that may be done just as well, or even better, in the city,
home, or school may expect to find increasing promotional
problems.

Let us make sure that camping leadership establishes and

maintains a high criteria of professional camping personnel
standards for director and staff. Let us insert into our camp
programs the “core of camping” and capitalize on the in-
creasing popularity of camping by providing real camping
know-how and experience. Let us make camping so strong
that all churches, homes, and schools will recognize it as
an American heritage to be treasured and maintained. #

 

 

HEN Clarence E. Brewer terminates his active
Wservice with the National Recreation Association

at the close of the Great Lakes District Conference,
April 11-14, he will have given the field of recreation fifty
years of dedicated service. Mr. Brewer was still a teenager
when he started to work in 1910 for the newly created Pub-
lic Department of Recreation in Columbus, Ohio. He was
attending Ohio State University at the time and served as
playground director during his entire college course.

In 1914 he received his BA in sociology and physical
education. For the next two years, he continued at Colum-
bus as SUpervisor of boys’ and men’s activities. Then, after
a year in charge of the parks and recreation program at
Racine, Wisconsin, he.became supervisor of boys’ and men’s
activities for the Detroit, Michigan, Recreation Commission.

Having been close to the national recreation movement
for several years through the National Recreation Con-
gresses, he became interested in the wartime recreation
services of the National Recreation Association, which were
just becoming focused upon the country through War Camp
Community Service, the World War I organization of the
association. From June 6, 1919 to November 1, 1920, he

served as a community organizer on the field staff of
WCCS. He then received appointment as commissioner of
recreation at Detroit, Michigan, taking a leave of absence
from WCCS-NRA. For twenty years he did an outstanding
job as commissioner in Detroit, continuing in that capacity
until the new charter amendment consolidated the recreation
and park work of the city under the newly created depart-
ment of parks and recreation. In December, 1940 he re-
ceived a temporary appointment as general SUperintendent
of the new department, and this appointment became perma-
nent in April, 1941. In January 1943, it became necessary
for Mr. Brewer to resign because of illness.

Clarence E. Brewer

31W yawn. 0g. 59/111102.

He rejoined the NRA staff on April 1, 1943, and the work
of the association took all of his time from then on. Through-
out the World War II period, he served as a special NRA
field representative, working with war industries, manage-
ment, and labor concerned with the problem of adequate
recreation services for defense workers. He visited and
studied more than five hundred industrial plants in more
than thirty states. Few men are given as intimate a knowl-
edge as Mr. Brewer has of the industrial recreation problem
and of the techniques used in organizing to meet it. In more
recent years, Mr. Brewer has served as the Association’s
district representative in New York State, in the Great
Lakes District and, currently, in the State of Michigan.

IN HIS SERVICE as NRA district representative to several
hundred cities since 1943, Mr. Brewer has very effectively
used the fine knowledge of recreation and park techniques
and organization which he absorbed during his periods of
service in Detroit, Racine, and Columbus, and through his
attendance at many meetings, conferences, and Congresses
from year to year. He helped in making studies of recrea-
tion and education resources available in several large
regions of the country to the men and women of the armed
services. He collaborated with other planners in making
community recreation studies in a number of important
cities and in preparing official reports covering such studies.

Mr. Brewer has been deeply interested in softball and
baseball. He has been a member of the National Committee
for Amateur Baseball and is a past-president of the Amateur
Baseball Federation. He has been a member of the Inter-
national Joint Rules Committee on Softball for thirty years,
and served as its chairman during a large part of that period.

The recreation movement is indebted to the many contri-
butions made by another of the pioneers who helped it grow

into the force it is today. #

There are some men who lift the level of the age they inhabit
until all men stand on higher ground in that lifetime.

Physical Fitness
Sirs:

Let’s place the responsibility for the
lack of physical fitness of the youth of
America upon the right shoulders. Un-
fit adult leaders cannot and do not give
sound mental and physical fitness lead-
ership to the children of today. Ameri-
can adults criticize the lack of fitness of
our children as compared to that of
European children. But do these same
adults compare the degree of fitness of
American adults to that of European
adults? N0!

Parents and paid youth leaders can-
not give positive youth fitness leader-
ship if they are mentally unhealthy and
physically unfit to provide that type of
leadership. The poor mental and physi-
cal iitness abilities of many of our chil-
dren may be the direct result of the
many ruts into which adults may fall
and to the fact that many adults lack
the courage to face themselves in the
true prospective. =President Eisenhower
was criticized because he took every
measure to keep physically and men-
tally fit.

Remember, fitness must start at home
with the parents. Children will learn
more from examples shown by adult
leaders than they will from statistics
taken from some athletic tests and mea-
surement examinations.

Joy of Winter

Sirs:

When I was a student at Dartmouth
and had the only pair of skis in college,
one was considered a bit on the queer
side if one had the temerity to say that
skiing was a good sport. It was with
the feeling that, if initiated into the joys
of winter, others would enjoy it as
much as I did that I organized the Dart-
mouth Outing Club in 1909. Now, on
its fiftieth anniversary, the club has

grown from sixty members to over a
thousand.

The influence of the D.O.C'. has
spread over the United States. It led

to the founding in 1922 of the United
States Eastern Amateur Ski Associa-
tion, the largest association in this
country. The first annual meeting was
held in Brattleboro, Vermont. It was
also this year in which the big ski jump-
ing hill was built in Brattleboro on
which four national championships
have been held and which was once
again the site of the ski jumping cham-
pionship of the United States in Febru-
ary 1961.

I regret that one phase of skiing has
been greatly neglected. I refer to ski
touring. It is all very wonderful to be
whisked to the top of the mountain and
then slide down and do this over and
over again, but the person who has
never strapped a knapsack on his back
and gone on an all day exploratory ski
trip has missed one of the finest experi-
ences winter can offer. A cross-country
tour will take you to places you will
otherwise never see.

Perhaps the greatest contribution
which skiing has made is in connection '
with physical and mental fitness. With
all our modern push-button appliances
and save-work gadgets, Americans tend
to become soft and very much need .
some interest to stimulate them to
healthy outdoor exercise. Instead of
being a period of hibernation, winter
is now eagerly anticipated by over three
million ski enthusiasts. Skiing has be-
come big business and vast amounts of
money have been spent in providing
wonderful facilities in the form of ski
lifts and accommodations. Although
competitions have greatly increased,
there are probably a hundred recrea-
tional skiers for every competitive skier.
A splendid feature is that whole fami-
lies engage in the sport.

Our nation can not afford to grow
soft. There is no doubt but what skiing
is making a valuable and vital contribu-
tion toward keeping our people strong\
and healthy. I, 3

Seniors on the Job
Sirs:

Since you have been stressing aging
[senior citizen programs] I would like\_

RECREATION

to call your attention to a wonderful
book by T. A. (Dad) Erickson of Min-
nesota. It is M y Sixty Years with Rural
Youth (University of Minnesota Press,
$2.75) . The author was a school teacher
for thirty years and then worked with
boys’ and girls’ clubs for over thirty
years. If you have ever lived on a farm
you will enjoy this book. It makes me
think of the sentence on Page 25 of
your January issue: “Growing old is no
more than a bad habit a busy man has
no time to learn” (Andre Maurois) . I
am now seventy-four years old and
have been 3 4H leader for the past
seventeen years and I find this sentence
very true. Another fine book is The
Call of the Land, an excellent story of

4H work.

Professional Advisor
Sirs:

In my opinion, RECREATION Maga-
zine has steadily and noticeably im-
proved in content and in format. It has
always been an interesting publication,
but with the steady improvement- in
quality of the articles and the subject
matter covered, it now plays the role, in
many instances, of a professional ad-
visor. This is indeed beneficial to rec-
reation administrators.

FOLK SONG COLLECTIONS

S OMETIMES the newest tune on the hit
parade is an old folk song. At the
moment folk songs are riding high on
the air Waves, spinning inside juke
boxes, and being whistled by checkout
clerks in supermarkets. Their popu-
larity waxes and wanes in cycles. The

purists may deplore this popularity.‘

Certainly folk songs are prey to great
liberties, and the pop versions are apt
to be slicked up, more gimcrackery than
J imm y-crack-corn.

This latest popularity of the folk song
is reflected in the many specialized folk
song collections now being published.
These offer recreation leaders fresh in-
spiration and material for their pro-
grams. The following collections are
reviewed by Siebolt Frieswyk of the Na-
tional Recreation Association Program
Service.

singer’s collection, tastefully printed,
and adorned with appropriate woodcuts
from the original Dublin woodsheet

ballads. The 102 folk songs are of
every variety of mood, story, and
rhythm; each is meant to be sung by
anyone who loves a good melody and
lyric. They also lend themselves beauti—
fully to group singing, and often to
dramatization.

RECREATION I

 

b AN EIcIITEEN-MONTH MORATORIUM
on applications to buy public lands has
been declared by the US. Department
of the Interior, effective immediately.
Secretary of the Interior Stewart L.
Udall declares the measure is designed
to give the department time to draft
new legislation for the public lands.
This legislation will be designed to per-
mit the federal government to use and
sell the land in the public interest—for
state and local park projects, for urban
development areas, and for such needs
as airports, sanitary fill land, or televi-
sion-transmitter sites.

The moratorium affects some 470,-
000,000 acres of non-mineral lands in
the West, including nearly 300,000,000
acres in Alaska. It does not affect the
60,000 applications now pending. The
lands involved are those known in the
Department of the Interior as “unre-
served public domain,” the remnants of
the original public-domain lands settled
in the West by homesteading and land-
grabbing. The land is dry, arid, up-
land, generally without water, some of
it on mountain tops. (F or more on See-

retary Udall’s future plans, see Page
127.)

b A NEW ATTACK on the “forever wild”
status of New York State’s Forest Pre-
serve has come from Robert Moses,
chairman of the State Council of Parks.
Mr. Moses is urging Governor Nelson
Rockefeller to support a revision Of the
state constitution that would open up
the Forest Preserve for controlled rec-
reation use. Declares Mr. Moses, “It is
senseless for us to buy additional recre-
ation land in outlying sections, espe-
cially for camping, when we have so
much already owned by the state in the
Forest Preserve counties but locked up
against even limited use.” A change in
the state constitution must be approved
by two successively elected legislatures
and by a referendum before it can be-
come effective. Previously highway
planners and skiing interests have as-
sailed the provision.

) A MID-SOUTH CONFERENCE has been
added to the schedule of National Rec-

reation Association District Confer-
ences. The meeting will he held April
6-7 at the Lafayette Hotel, Lexington,
Kentucky. The Mid-South section is

MARCH 1961

designated for the states of Virginia,
West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky,

and North Carolina.

> A BILL TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACES in
and around urban communities for rec-
reation and air travel has been intro-
duced in the US. Senate by Senator
Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey.
The Williams bill would provide for
federal assistance of $100,000,000 a
year to state and local governments to
share 25 percent of the cost of preserv-
ing open space land in and around ur-
ban areas. The bill’s intent is to provide
a means, through recreation, conserva-
tion, and scenic areas, to encourage
more economic and desirable patterns
of urban development and growth. The
bill would also encourage the provision
of park and recreation areas in urban
renewal projects by permitting the fed-
eral government to bear the full cost of
the land put to such uses.

> A COMPROMISE SOLUTION to the
knotty Glen Canyon—Rainbow Bridge
situation has been proposed by Secre-
tary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall.
The battle has seen the proponents of a
much-needed water project stalemated
by conservationists who fear the water
backed up from the Glen Canyon dam
might erode the Rainbow Bridge, the
world’s largest natural bridge, in south-
eastern Utah on the Arizona border.
Under the Udall compromise the water
would back up against the bridge but
not erode it.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

) LAST CALLS: The 1961 Kodak High
School Photo Awards will accept en-
tries until March 31. Open to students
in grades nine through twelve who at-
tend high school daily in the United
States or its territorial possessions, the
competition offers cash awards and a
nationwide exhibition of the winning
photos. Entries and inquiries Should be

addressed to Kodak High School Photo
Awards, Rochester 4, New York.

° March 31 is also the closing date for
the American Machine and Foundry
Company  Awards for outstand-
ing reporting in the field of physical
recreation, to the author or authors of
the best article, column, or editorial

published in this field in a US. maga-
zine. The awards will be administered
and adjudged in close cooperation with
the National Recreation Association

(see RECREATION, November 1960,
Page 408).

b BIRDS vs AIRCRAFT. The Federal Avi-
ation Agency recently gave the Fish and
Wildlife Service $100,000 for research
on bird collision with aircraft. The
problem has been with us ever since
man took to the air but jets have ag-
gravated the situation.

) BOATING CONTINUES TO ZOOM. The
boating industry reports that over 40,-
000,000 persons participated in recrea-
tion boating during 1960, spending
over $2,000,000,000 on boats, motors,
accessories, storage, boat-club member-
ships, docking, and maintenance.

} A NEW LOOK is in store for Audubon
Magazine. Editor John R. Vosburgh,
Jr. says the magazine will expand its
non-bird departments, especially con-
servation, and within a year may intro-
duce its first color photographs. The
magazine plans to campaign for more
public parks, both inland and seashore.

) ANOTHER CONSOLIDATION 0F PARKS
AND RECREATION. The city of White
Plains, New York, is combining its de-
partment of recreation and its bureau
of parks this month.

) RECREATION SCHOLARSHIPS. Scholar-
ship aid for students in the field Of rec-
reation and park management will be
available at South Illinois University
next year, according to Dr. William
Freeberg, chairman Of the recreation
and outdoor education program.

A $1,000 scholarship for distribution
over a four-year period will be Offered
by the Student Recreation Council of
the Skokie Park District in Skokie, Illi-

nois.

) TEENAGE NARCOTICS ADDICTS in New
York City may be sent to youth camps
in an attempt by the city to work out
new programs to replace facilities at
the city’s Riverside Hospital on North
Brothers Island. The hospital program
serves largely as a means of detoxify-
ing. The proposed camp programs will
be flexible and in the nature of an ex-
periment. Help from private agencies
in the state is being sought. (For more
on narcotic addiction, see Page 155.)

) MOTORBOAT REGULATIONS for the
protection of two lakes in Yellowstone
National Park have been established by
the U.S. Department of the Interior.
Only hand-propelled watercraft will be
permitted on Shosone Lake and on ap-
proximately twenty percent of Yellow-
stone Lake. The Lewis River Channel,
the water gateway to Shosone Lake, will
also be restricted to hand-operated
craft. Motorboats will be permitted to
use about eighty percent of the 139
square miles of Yellowstone Lake. The
National Park Service intends to im-
prove facilities along the unzoned areas
of Yellowstone Lake. These include new
lakefront campgrounds and picnic
areas, a marina at Bridge Bay, and ad-
ditional launching ramps.

} A CRITICAL WATER SHORTAGE by 1970
is predicted by the House Science and
Astronautics Committee, which says the
United States is likely to be the first
of the world’s largest industrial nations
to find itself seriously threatened by
fresh water shortages. Large-scale con«
version of salt water may be the only

ultimate solution to the problem, the
committee warns.

CHANGING PATTERNS in CAMPING

Reynold E. Carlson

T HE VERY WORD “camping” casts its

magic spell over the lives of both
children and adults. Today millions of
American families camp in the parks
and forests throughout America. Some
live in the comparative luxury of the
travel trailer, some take tents; the more
rugged penetrate the wilderness by
canoe, on horseback or on foot. Never before has the prob-
lem of providing adequate land and facilities been as acute.
Organized camping, too, has burgeoned. The child camp
population is growing faster than the child population it-

self; and all kinds of camps—private, agency, public and
religious—share this increase.

 

These phenomena are part of a new surge into the out-of-
doors, made possible by the increase in income and leisure
of the average person. Though the reasons for this move-
ment are complex, many believe that it results from the
need of human beings to reestablish their fundamental ties
with nature—to get back to fields, streams, lakes, and to the
basic process of caring for oneself in the simple setting of
the out-of—doors.

Camping has not only grown; it has shifted in emphasis.
The most conspicuous development has been in informal
family camping. Though this type of camping is the oldest
in existence, its growth in the past few years has been ex-
plosive. Our parks and forests have been caught unpre-
pared. Last summer more than forty thousand family
campers were unable to find Spaces in the Michigan State
Parks. In Wisconsin, the shortage of camping spaces in
state parks resulted in a statewide furor. In the national
parks and forests the number of family campers has over-
taxed campgrounds. The travel trailer has added a new
dimension to the traveling public, and in some Western
campgrounds one-third to one-half of the spaces are some-
times occupied by trailers.

Campers are not only increasing at the roadside but are
also moving into wilder areas, such as the canoe routes of
the Superior National Forest and the trails of the western
mountains. One wonders, sometimes, how many people the

wilderness can absorb without losing the very quality that
the visitors seek.

Growth of Family Camping

Various groups have stimulated and guided the interest
in family camping. Five new family camping magazines
were launched during 1960. A great number of new family
camping clubs and associations were launched and the
membership of those already in existence expanded. F amin
camping clinics, demonstrations, and round-ups are intro-

ducing new families to the techniques of living out-of—doors.
The recreation departments in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and
Rockford, Illinois, sponsor such demonstrations. ( See also
“Families Plan Now, Camp Later,” RECREATION, December
1960.) In New Hampshire, 3 state-wide family camping
workshop has been held for several seasons. In Washing-
ton, D. C., a family camping workshop was conducted under
the auspices of the Washington section of the American
Camping Association and the Washington YMCA. Several
colleges and universities have also entered the field of fam-
ily camping through workshops, conferences, and clinics.
Among these are Western Michigan, University of Illinois,
and Southern Illinois University.

What has caused this spurt in family camping? Longer
vacations, increased incomes, and consequent mobility of
the American family have been important influences. Em-
phasis on activities which the whole family can enjoy to-
gether is another factor.

Economics also enters the picture. Vacationing in motels
and at resorts is expensive, especially for large families;
and more and more people are learning that a family can
live almost as cheaply while camping as at home.

Another reason may“ lie in the fact that organized camps
of a generation ago so effectively indoctrinated their camp-
ers with a love of camping that these campers, now heads
of households, are eager to share their outdoor skills with
children of their own. However, probably the most impor-
tant reason for family camping is that, with the urbaniza-
tion of American life, the need for outdoor recreation away
from the city is more keenly felt.

What are the implications in family camping for modern
planning of outdoor areas? Certainly there must be in.
creased attention to the need for campgrounds. Commer-
cially operated family camping facilities are now being
developed in many parts of the United States. These are
of two types: those designed primarily for travelers, in
which one night is the ordinary length of stay and camps
for vacationers. In the latter, there must be varied program
activities available and the site must be large, attractive.
and adaptable for extended stays. Commercial develop-
ments, of course, must make a charge sufficient to make the
ventures profitable. The family camping public is very
probably willing to pay, and there is every reason to believe
that there will be a rapid expansion of commercial camps.
However, public campgrounds will have to bear the major
burden of accommodating family campers. The large na-
tional and state forests and parks, which are the major land
resources for family camping, will have to provide more
camping spaces. The camping public has been requesting
more and more comfortable facilities; and, where these are
provided, charges should be made to cover costs. It is to
be hoped, however, that small, simple campgrounds will
continue to be available at low fees so as not to deter great

numbers who wish to camp. H

yond that of the classroom program. In spite of the numer-
ous difliculties, however, schools that have made a real ef-
fort in this field have found it to be tremendously rewarding. k

One might ask what the impact of the school outdoor-
education program is upon the summer camp. Although
there are no conclusive studies, it seems logical to suppose
that the knowledge and interest acquired would result in
increased attendance at summer camps.

An illustration of cooperation between the schools and
the municipal park and recreation department is found in
Rockford, Illinois. Here a new facility, the Atwood Out-
door Education Center, has been developed by the city.
With school and city personnel, an excellent outdoor edu-
cation program is under way. It would be wise to develop

 

more cooperative programs in coming years, since park and

camping programs for children? Certainly parents will
continue to want their children to have the invaluable ex-
perience of camping with other children in a good summer
camp with defined objectives, varied program and trained
leadership.

School Outdoor Education Programs

Another growth in the use of the out-of—doors occurs in
the school-conducted outdoor education programs in camp
settings. From meager beginnings some twenty years ago,
the programs have increased slowly but steadily; today
there are five or six hundred programs in the United States.
These programs are related definitely to school science, con-
servation, history, geography, physical education, and other
subject fields. They are intended primarily to provide di-
rect outdoor experiences so as to enrich and give reality to
the classroom curriculum. The programs take on many of
the attributes of the summer camp, including living in small
groups, informal learning situations, and many of the tra-
ditional activities of the summer camp. Usually the children
attend camp for one week. The fifth or sixth grades are the
ones most commonly taken to camp.

Several difficulties lie in the way of the expansion of the
school outdoor education program. Adequate understand-
ing of the reasons for the program is lacking. Parents,
school-board members, and sometimes administrators, al-
though recognizing the values of the direct learning experi-
ences, are sometimes unaware of the close relationships
to the objectives and content of the school. Also, there is
a lack of suitable facilities. Winterized camps are neces-
sary, since these programs usually take place during the
school year, when weather may be unreliable. There is
also a lack of trained personnel to conduct such programs.

Another dilliculty is that of expense. Parents usually pay
for the food and lodging at camp, while the school board
pays for all expenses connected with leadership and instruc-
tion. Another problem is that the school outdoor education
program demands organization, initiative, and energy be-

Today’s Implications for the Organized Camp

What are the implications to camping of the increased
emphasis on science instruction in our schools? Certainly
there are some phases of science which are adaptable to
the camp. The camp, for example, is an ideal setting for
conservation education—for practicing good land use and -
for helping young people develop understanding and sound
attitudes toward our natural resources ( see Page 108).

What are the implications to camping of our rising stand-
ard of living, our high income, and the trend toward more
ease and comfort? The great appeal of camping has been
in providing experiences in the out-of—doors that differ from
those of the city. The deadening effects of over-citilication,
dependence upon gadgets, and over-protection must not be
allowed in camps, for they will take from camping the very
things that have given it its great value and appeal in the
past.

Do camps have a special contribution to make toward
physical fitness in a day when a great deal of physical ac-
tivity has been eliminated from the lives of city-dwelling
boys and girls? Should camps provide meaningful work
experiences and more opportunities for strenuous outdoor
activities such as hiking, swimming, boating, and canoe-
ing? According to recent fitness reports, maybe we need
to stimulate more walking for American youth.

What are the implications to camping of the nuclear age?
During World War II there was evidence that those young
men who had had good camping experiences were better
able to cope with army conditions than those who had not.
Does camp training in outdoor living have survival value in
case of national catastrophe? (See “Fun and National
Strength,” RECREATION, February 1961.)

We have considered here only a few of the trends and
problems in camping in modern American life. Camping
must and will change to meet the needs of changing society.
However, it must continue to meet certain basic unchanging
human needs and, we hope, will remain a joyous, adventur-
ous experience for youth. #

EAST POTOMAC PARK, in which the

Potomac Park Motor Court is lo-
cated, is bounded on the west by the
Potomac River and on the east by the
Washington Channel. Across the chan-
nel are the municipal wharves, from
which boats depart for Mount Vernon,
Marshall Hall Amusement Park, and a
few foreign ports. Many private motor
and sailboats also use these docks and
operate on the river and channel to add
interest to the scene. The residences
and headquarters buildings of Fort Mc-
Nair and the National Wrar College are
located across the channel. Where the
channel meets the Anacostia River, op-
posite Hains Point in East Potomac
Park, airplane activities at Bolling
Field (U.S. Air Force) and the Naval
Air Station at Anacostia make an ex-
citing spectacle. Opposite the west side
of the point are the National Airport,
the Pentagon Building, and the Mount
Vernon Memorial Highway.

About the middle of September, the
powerboat races of the President’s Cup
Regatta—an event of nationwide inter-
est and importance—are run on the
Potomac near Hains Point. Sailboat
races are also sponsored here in June
and during the summer.

At the Tidal Basin, within a half mile
of the motor court, canoes and pedal-

by the Missouri State Park Board are
booked almost solid for the three vaca-
tion months of June, July, and August.
Most all the camps are taken on week-
ends from April 1st to June lst and
September 1st to October 15th.

Group camping is not a do-it-yourself
project. The state parks furnish the
facilities, and organizations, such as the
Boy and Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls,
schools, 4-H Clubs, FFA, church
groups, YWCA, Jewish Community
Center Association, and United Fund
Agencies from Kansas City and St.
Louis, furnish the campers. The several
thousand children, many of them un-
derprivileged and from the neglected
middle class, as far as camping is con-
cerned, would be unable to enjoy a
camping experience if they were not
sponsored by these organizations. For
these reasons, the state park board feels
justified in constructing and maintain-
ing group camp facilities.

The park system does not enter into
programing or directing, but periodic-
ally evaluates each camp to see that
proper use is made of the facilities for
which they were intended. When sub-
par programs are observed, recommen-
dations and suggestions are given to the
organization conducting the camp which
assists them in obtaining good camp
practices.

Each camping organization is respon-
sible for staffing, programing and the
proper care of all physical facilities. It
teaches good outdoor manners to pro-
tect the flora and fauna of the parks.
Besides the park system staff, other state
agencies cooperate with the camping
agencies; giving instructions are con-
servation agents, state foresters, and
county agents. Each camp has a com-

pletely equipped dining lodge and kitch-

four have a recreation building, craft
house, board of health-approved water
and sanitary systems. All but two have
excellent water fronts, including four
with pools. The total capacity in six-
teen group camps is 2,362. Charges for
their use are $.25 per camper per day
plus utilities and maintenance while in
camp.

IN ADDITION to the satisfaction received
by the state park board and the peo-
ple of Missouri for furnishing camping
privileges to the youth of the state,
many other benefits are derived. As
most camping agencies are governed by
a board of directors, composed mostly
of influential lay personnel, they also
offer their assistance to the state park
board in many ways, an example of
which is best expressed in a letter from
Sam Negrin, director of Camp Haw-
thorn, sponsored by the Jewish Com-
munity Centers Association of St. Louis:

“I am certain that you are aware of
the importance in maintaining an on-
going relationship between your board
and the lay members of our own com-
munity who take an active leadership
role as they serve on the Camp Haw-
thorn Board. This relationship is par-

appreciate and recognize the value of
this wonderful spirit of cooperation
which both of our boards have demon-
strated over the past years. Yours, in
their efforts to continually provide max-
imum facilities at Hawthorn which are
in keeping with the best of camping
standards, and ours, in their efforts to

operation of the state park system as
well as giving community recognition
to the important role played by the state
park board not only as it effects our
camping service, but as it relates to the
total welfare of the general community.

“This kind of mutual understanding
and cooperation between public and
private agencies is an exemplar} one
which we point to with pride. It is our
sincere hope that we may continue to
enjoy and build upon this spirit so that
we may look forward to providing our

WOODSMOKE

FOR
FAMILIES

NY FAMILY IN the state of New Hampshire who enjoys
A camping or feels the lure of the forest trail is invited
each year to register for an annual state-wide Family
Camporee. Held after Labor Day in beautiful, wooded
White Lake State Park, this pioneering experiment in help-
ing families with camping know-how has been made possi-
ble by the united efforts of the New Hampshire Recreation
Society and the National Recreation Association. It is co-
ordinated and run by NRA’s state representative, Richard
(Wink) Tapply.

Last year marked the third year of success for this ven-
ture. Only three camporees were planned originally; but,
. with the enthusiasm and interest engendered* through ac-
tual participation, an increasing number of families have
been signing up and the decision as of now is to continue
with the help of a camporee committee. Its purpose, as oili-
cially stated, is as follows:

1. To provide all lovers of the out-of—doors the Opportu-
nity to gather together in good fellowship at one of the
beautiful state parks.

2. To make possible the exchange of ideas! Each family
does its outdoor living in a manner to fit its particular needs
and desires. We can each teach the other something new
in camping tricks and equipment.

3. To demonstrate a variety of program ideas in which

each family unit can participate on its own camping trips.
The three days of the 1960 Camporee, September 9-11,
were packed with instruction and activity around a weekend
theme of “The Smile of a Friendly Camper.” The program
lined up as follows:
Friday, 8:30 PM, “Get Acquainted Gathering,” around
campfire on beach.
Saturday, archery balloon shoot for boys and girls who
could chalk up some experience with the bow and arrow; a
family field day for everyone; novelty water sports; demon-
stration of charcoal cooking and baking; folk-dance party

,for tiny tots; instruction on how to tie useful camp knots;

safety tips for camping and first aid; campfire gather on
the beach in the evening for singing, awards, stunts.
Sunday, conservation walk for grownups; nature treasure
hunt for small fry; parent-child archery contest—ending at
10 AM, thus giving parents time for the journey home be-
fore evening.

At the start of the first year, in 1958, Wink set up a bul-
letin, called Smoke Rings, which acts as a medium of com-
munication with campers and possible campers during the
year as well as for camping instructions and so on. It is
part of the “kit” handed each family upon registration. The
1958 kit carried the following, which is still used and hast
been found very helpful.

SUGGESTIONS FOR EQUIPMENT

It is difiicult to set down a satisfactory list of equipment
necessary for a family camping trip. Such a list depends
on many things, including desires of each family, type of \

RECREATION

 

car used, age and number of children, and the extent of
camping contemplated. The purchase of expensive equip-
ment is unnecessary——many families are camping satisfac-
torily using everyday household equipment.

BASIC ITEMS—Suggested “basic” items include tent, tar-
paulin, cooler, stove, cook kit, lamp, air mattresses, and
sleeping bags. It is obvious all these items are not necessi-
ties for every family. Sleeping accommodations may often
be arranged in a station wagon or the type of car the seats
of which convert to a bed, altering the size of tent needed.
Some state and national parks provide a storage food box
in the ground which can be iced, eliminating the need of
a cooler. Cooking over an open fire may make a stove su-
perfluous. A camp light may be merely a flashlight or a
kerosene lantern. Kitchen utensils may take the place of
the nested cook kit. Blankets and sleeping pads may ade-
quately replace the more desirable air mattresses and sleep-
ing bags.

TENTS—A. tent for outdoor living may be one of several de-
signs and varying quality. Study the possibilities carefully
if your family considers this purchase. A sewn-in ground
cloth, mosquito netting protection, and a fly which ade-
quately shelters the doorway are highly desirable features.
Far more simple protection, which may possibly be bor-
rowed for the initial trip, may be quite adequate. The only
time when a camp can be downright miserable is when it
rains. A tarp measuring at least 12’ -by~12’ that can be
rigged between tent and car may be a “life-saver.”

COOK KITS——-Four- or six-man cook kits are not too expen-
sive and contains two fry pans, two kettles, coffee pot, cups,

‘ MARCH 1961

and plates. It is well to add individual bowls of flexible
plastic which will also fit inside the kit. In selecting items
from your kitchen equipment it is well to keep in mind:
Choose only the articles you need to prepare the menus you
have planned. Wooden handles on cookware are easily
damaged over an open fire; bottoms of pans will be sadly
blackened. This, however, need not be tragic; rubbing the
bottoms with yellow soap before subjecting them to the
smoke will facilitate cleaning them; a jar of scouring pads
is also a tremendous help. Cut the pads in small pieces
before you leave home; one small piece will probably clean
a meal’s supply of pans and can be immediately discarded.
Paper towels eliminate a lot of packing and work-—-use them

for place mats, napkins, for food preparation, for dish and
hand towels, and for general clean-up.

SLEEPING BAGS—Some single sleeping bags can be opened
flat, then zipped together to form a double bag. A very
good substitute for a double sleeping bag may be made at
home by sewing two blankets together across the foot and
up the sides to within eighteen or twenty inches of the top
to form a bag that cannot come untucked. Some may prefer
to lay sheeting (Hannel for cool weather) inside the blan-
kets before sewing. An extra blanket or puff for warmth
may be secured by a series of ties around the outer edge.
A single bag may likewise be made by folding a blanket
lengthwise and sewing across the bottom and up the one
open side.

MATTRESSES—Choice of air mattresses is rubber or plastic.
Each has its merits. Rubber is more expensive but far more
durable. Plastic is lighter to pack and carry. In either
case patching materials should be kept handy. Either vari-
ety may be inflated by mouth but a pump is by far the
quicker and easier method. Children, because their bodies
are light, usually sleep very well on the ground with extra
blankets or pad for protection from chill or dampness. Mom
and Dad will really appreciate air mattresses for a good
night’s sleep.

STOVES, LANTERNS, COOLERsmMost of the standard-make
stoves, coolers, and lamps are good. One single-mantle gas-
oline lantern gives excellent light. If traveling, a cooler
may be a nuisance——it is bulky and often times ice is not
readily at hand. Perishable foodstuff can usually be pur-
chased a meal or a day at a time. Many of the new stoves
and lanterns may be operated on regular gas instead of the

special white gas.

Remember that when you buy your “basic” items you are
buying for a lifetime of use. Shop carefully and insist 011

All of North America

Bert H. Snow

TODAY, camp di-
rectors must
struggle with the
chronic problems
of rising costs, lack

of good leaders, a
search for new ac-

 

tivities, competi-
tion with family vacations, and holding
campers as they enter the teen years.
The growing possibility of an eleven-
month school year and a general uncer-
tainty of the role of camping in the
coming years of the space age make di-
rectors aware of a need for re-evalua-
tion of present camp patterns.

In Keene, New Hampshire, the
YMCA recently opened a new building,
with a subsequent reorganization and
expansion of its program. Since a day
camp was already serving younger
children and a fine resident camp of
another organization reached boys and
girls in the community, it was not de-
sirable or financially possible to build
another camp. Still, camping activities
for the younger teenage group were
lacking. Therefore, the Y organized
Camp Cheechako. It is a program
rather than a place. With a season ex-
tending over the entire year, Camp
Cheechako offers a real camping exper-
ience, combined with travel and a wide
variety of activities, to boys and girls.
The camp owns no buildings or
grounds, but has all of North America
as its campus. Cheechako features trips

of varying lengths during school vaca-
tions from January to December and on
weekends throughout the year. The trip
camp was organized at a cost of less
than $500.

Trip camping is growing and the
Camp Cheechako program has been re-
ceived with enthusiasm by campers.
The trip camp is not an extension of
another day or resident camp, but an
independent camp sponsored by the
agency. Its season consists of a series of
camping trips to a variety of places and
with a great variety of activities. Since
1959 its campers have visited twenty-
three states and Canada. Among the
more popular places have been Niagara
Falls, the Black Hills, Yellowstone Park,
the cities of Denver, Detroit, and Oma-
ha, as well as many parts of New Eng-
land and New York.

Camp activities have included moun-
tain climbing, skiing, ocean fishing,
visits to industrial sites, rodeos, and
places of historical interest. Camera
hunting and mid-August snowball fights
are long remembered by the campers.
Common to all trips has been the ex-
perience of camping in tents and using
camp skills. Cheechako provides all
major items of camping equipment,
with campers furnishing their sleeping
bags, personal clothing and incidentals
only.

CAREFUL PLANNING is necessary for

success in trip camping. The trips
are planned and announced months in
advance. The 1961 trip series will in-
clude winter camps in Vermont, a
spring vacation trip to Washington,
D. C., several weekend trips to places
of interest in New England, followed
by a summer vacation program of trips
of one week or more in duration. Fall
months feature weekend climbing trips
in New Hampshire, while winter brings
skiing ventures.

The series is planned to include trips
of varying lengths and duration, with
a wide range of costs to the camper and
a wide variety of activities. An over-
night trip to a nearby site has been the
shortest Camp Cheechako trip. The
1962 trip of seven weeks to Alaska will
be its longest with most of the campers
already enrolled.

Once the season’s trips have been
chosen as a series, each trip is planned

each trip is worked out. A file is kept

cluding admission rates to places in-
cluded for visits, fees for campsites, and
all other important data. With this at
hand, the final itinerary for each trip is
put together. Daily travel distances are
kept low to allow plenty of time for
sightseeing.

As soon as itineraries are completed
the battle of the camp budget begins.
Again, each trip is budgeted as a sep-
arate unit. Items to be closely estimated
include transportation, food supplies,
costs of camp promotion, admission
fees, insurance, camping equipment,
salaries, first aid supplies, film, cost of
travelers’ checks, and contingencies.
Transportation is the largest single
item of the Camp Cheechako budget,
since rented station wagons and char-
tered buses are used. Ownership of
vehicles in the near future will greatly
reduce this cost.

With itineraries planned, budget
prepared, and fees established, the camp
folder is written and promotion begins.
Camp Cheechako uses direct mail, news
releases, camp reunions, personal con-
tacts, and, at times, paid advertising to
promote its season. Enrollments usual-
ly come in early and most trips are filled
to capacity. Campers enroll for as many
trips as they wish in any season.

CONTRARY T0 expectations, it has not
been difficult to obtain excellent
leaders for Camp Cheechako. Leaders
for trip camps are mother, father, ad-
ministrator, teacher, supervisor, dis-
ciplinarian, and handyman, all at the
same time, while on the road. They
must have an even temperament, steady
nerves, and great physical stamina. It 
has never been necessary to recruit such 
people for the trip camp, since they ‘l
come forward themselves, attracted by
the adventure and challenge of the
camp. The greatest leadership problem
is that of choosing among good leaders.
Camp Cheechako leaders receive their

RECREATION

trip expenses, and a salary. Several of
its best leaders refused the latter!
Prior to the trip, campers are pre-
pared for the experience by newsletters,
mimeographed material, and lists of
books about places to be visited. The
local library is helpful in providing
with material
about the places they will visit. Parents
are informed about trip details, needed

campers educational

items of clothing and equipment, mail
addresses, and all matters of concern by
means of a newsletter. F or longer trips
a one-day meeting is held prior to trip
departure and campers carefully briefed
on procedures. Medical histories are
obtained for each camper, and a camp-
appointed doctor gives each camper a
checkup.

Camp Cheechako enrolls campers
from eleven years of age through high
school. The age range may be reduced
for specific trips, but on the long trips
boys from eleven through sixteen have
been included. This spread of age has
never been a problem; in fact, the older
campers usually voluntarily help the
younger. Within a few days natural
friendship groups will form among the
campers which tend to follow age pat-
terns.

FLEXIBILITY is an advantage of trip

camping, and groups vary in size
from six or seven campers to thirty or
forty. Particular trips appeal to certain
campers; small groups are sent by sta-
tion wagon, larger groups by bus.
School-type buses are used only for

MARCH 1961

 

shorter trips; bus coaches are char-
tered for longer ventures. With small
station-wagon groups the leader acts as
driver, with a safe record being one of
the major requirements. Bus drivers
are professionals assigned by the bus
company. The flexibility of transporta-
tion makes it possible to have several
groups on the road at one time, with
different destinations.

Leader-camper ratios vary on Cheech-
ako trips; the most usual is one adult
for six or seven boys. This is partly the
result of use of station wagons, with the
leader acting as driver-leader for his
own car group. The leader pattern for
longer bus trips includes the director;
one or two experienced adults; two bus
drivers who, if carefully selected, are a
valuable asset to the camp in many
ways; a junior leader of high school
age who is concerned with camp details;
and usually two tuition-free campers,

who perform many minor camp chores
in exchange for the trip experience.

THE AMOUNT of freedom given to
campers at various stops is up to
the director’s discretion in each in-
stance. During the day in small towns
campers may be “on their own” for a
specified period of time to sightsee at
will. When camp is made in the eve-
ning, at places of special interest, or for
planned activities, the campers may
either be in a closely supervised group
or “on their own” depending on the
nature of the place, the activity, and
whether a guided tour is involved.
Prior to the trip, campers choose
their own buddies, and these pairs not
only use the same tent, but are required
to stay together whenever freedom is
given to campers. There have been no
serious problems of supervision or con-
trol under this system, but needless to
say it is important to carefully count
all campers before the bus leaves!
Campers on Camp Cheechako trips
are required to maintain a high stand-
ard of conduct, and leaders “crack
down” heavily on this point. Unfor-
tunately some children’s groups on the
road have not been well supervised and
have left behind a bad reputation in
campgrounds. For this reason, chil-
dren’s groups are not welcomed in some
cases, and in some private campgrounds
not accepted. Camp Cheechako leaders
feel proper conduct is a matter of leader
responsibility. The number of compli-
ments received by Cheechako groups
has been gratifying, and campers seem
to take pride in these, although some of
the young “wolves” grumble when not
allowed to whistle from car windows!
The problems encountered on trip
camps are more than offset by the ad-
vantages of a camp of this kind. \Vith
boredom and homesickness almost non-
existent, and most administrative work
done before leaving, the camp director
can relax and deal with the problems
as they arise, with each day of the trip
bringing the group closer to the end
of another fine educational adven-

ture.

to a totlot, from playground baseball to

experiences. Actually, as S. N. Geal
says in his editorial on Page 109, “Day

they provide camping.” If the camp
program must be conducted indoors,
surely a little ingenuity can bring the
outdoors inside! Just erect a tent in the

There is nothing against summer fun

“camps” is very misleading, and con-
fusing to parents and others of the gen-

here a few examples of day camps
whose program may suggest ideas to
others as they plan their activities this
year. Why not, for example, give the
children a taste of what it is like to
live “next to nature,” as the saying
goes? Can they not learn some things
related to the camp experience that will
spirit them away, if only in imagina-
tion, from city surroundings—walls
and rooms—to the fields, the woods,
and the sky, to share in the summer’s
camping magic? Surely they can make
a nature collection, dig in the dirt and
plant seeds, watch the sky and learn
to read the weather signs, have “star
talks,” take a walk in the rain, experi-
ence other real outdoor “adventures”?

Camp-for-a-Day
IN A CITY as large as Minneapolis,
Minnesota, youngsters rarely have

the opportunity to enjoy the thrills of

camping out or “roughing it” in nature.
The Minneapolis Park Board has there-
fore tried to multiply those opportuni-
ties by setting up camping facilities in
a wooded area on the fringe of the city.
The recréation division of the Board of
Park Commissioners started operating
Camp-for-a-Day at Theodore Wirth
Park in 1949. This is the largest park
in the Minneapolis system, with 739
acres. It includes a golf course, swim-
ming beach, picnic area, wild flower
garden, and a large amount of rather
primitive natural area. The . name,
Camp-for-a-Day, is used because boys
and girls come for one day only, rather
than for a week or longer. In the first
year, Camp-for-a-Day was open only on
Fridays, with children from four to five
different playgrounds coming each
week on an experimental basis. The
success of this program was immediate,
and in 1950 it was expanded to four
days a week.

The first staff consisted of a camp
director and a park naturalist plus the
playground leaders who brought the
boys and girls from the various play-
grounds. The camp director is selected
from among the year-round recreation
center supervisors, someone who has a
special interest in camping; Camp-for-
a-Day becomes his assignment for the
summer months. The park naturalist
is chosen for his interest and ability in
the natural sciences, particularly those
adaptable to a camping situation. The
ages of the boys and girls attending
range from eight to twelve years, and if
more than fifteen attend from any one
playground, volunteer junior counsel-
ors are selected to go along with the
playground instructor.

The plan continued to operate this
way until 1959, then increased to every
day of the week to give the children
more Opportunities to attend. Each
playground has tWo days for the boys
and two days for the girls during the
summer season. The attendance in 1960
for thirty-four days was 2,677 or an

RECREATION

average of about seventy-nine per day.

Cost is kept at a minimum, $.40 per
camper, so that it is within the reach
of everyone. This covers cost of milk
and transportation; the latter—to and
from the camp—is provided by a pri-
vate bus company.

The program for the day includes a
tour through a museum maintained at
the camp headquarters and a hike along

a beautiful trail. Along the trail the.

children discover a clay pit and dig out
a handful of natural red clay. They are
encouraged to use this to make little
animals and leave them in the sun to
“bake.” They View the largest tree in
Minneapolis, a giant elm. The wild
raspberries, the hawk’s nest, the itch-
weed, and many other fascinating things
keep the hikers interested and enthusi-
astic for nearly an hour and a half.

Fishing is very popular during the
afternoon, probably because of the chil-
dren’s success in catching small sunfish.
For those who are not interested in fish-
ing, a nature scavenger hunt to Birch
Pond, another water area in the park,
is conducted.

Crafts are offered only on rainy days,
and then a nature theme is used. The
morning swimming period is enjoyed
at the regular beach on Wirth Lake,
with supervision furnished by the aqua-
tics section of the recreation division.

For the noon meal, the campers are
encouraged to bring something to cook
out; this has proved very successful.
Each playground group eats in a sep-
arate area, widely separated from other
groups.

One of the attractive features of this
one-day camp is that the children come
with their playground instructors whom
they already know and like. For many
of the boys and girls, Camp-for-a-Day
is their introduction to camping, and,
from this experience, many of them
register for the day camp at Baker
County Park—RICHARD J. J ORCENSEN,
assistant director of recreation, Board
of Park Commissioners, Minneapolis.

Audubon Day Camp

THE PURPOSE of this camp in Mem-
phis, Tennessee, run by the city
recreation department with the help of
a special staff, is “to provide wholesome
experience in outdoor living for the
boys and girls of Memphis, a means
through which they may develop indi-
vidual freedom and initiative while they
learn to live in groups.” The staff con-
sists of a director, who has four assist-
ants, two men and two women. Located
in wooded Audubon Park, to which the
children are brought from the play-
grounds and returned by bus, the day-
camp program includes swimming, hik-
ing, nature study, campcraft cookouts,
and field trips to places of interest.
The summer day-camp season is di-
vided into five periods of two weeks
each, and camp is held Monday through
Friday, from 9 AM to 4 PM. N 0 camper
may register for more than one period
or less than one period. A ten—dollar
fee is charged. Boys and girls must be
between eight and eleven years of age
to be eligible.

Call of the Moose
AT THE Moosejaw Day Camp in C01-

orado Springs, Colorado, periods
of a real camping program even include
some overnight camping. They run for
five days, and there are seven periods
during the summer. The program is
sponsored by the park and recreation
department and the elementary schools.
An invitation on the cover of one of the
recent camp program announcements
reads:

Dear Parent:

Your child is invited to an adventure
of explorations, overnight-stays, cookouts
and fishing excursions to prepare for
fuller outdoor enjoyment of the great

West.
The program is planned by a com-

bined committee from the two sponsor-

ing organizations. It includes other
camping activities, in addition to the
above, such as campcraft, fire building,

camp cooking, compass reading, track-

ing and trailing, interest trips, axeman-
ship, campfire programs, Indian lore,
fishing, fossil hunts, cave hunts, and
star chats. Overnight stays, on Thurs-
day nights, require special permission.

The camping periods at Moosejaw
are also of five-day duration, with seven
camp periods per summer, and the
camp is open to boys and girls of the

fourth, fifth and sixth grades. A $5.00

registration fee is charged per period.

They Move to the Woods
THE MUNICIPAL day camp of Topeka,

Kansas, is held at the Kiwanis
Youth Camp on Lake Shawnee, and its
purpose is that every boy and girl shall
know the fun of paddling a canoe, row-
ing a boat, going on a cook-out, shoot-
ing an arrow, riding a horse, singing
together outdoors, hiking with a unit,
catching a fish, and holding hands with
nature. It’s Operated for eight consecu-
tive one-week sessions, from June 15 to
August 7 and is coeducational. It is for
everyone between the ages of nine and
thirteen and for senior citizens during
the period of August 3 to August 7.
The staff consists of fourteen full-time
counselors. Fifty or so outstanding
campers of previous years are chosen
to assist with activities during the sum-
mer. They meet with the camp staff
before camp starts and receive special
training for their duties. The cost of
milk, bus transportation, one cook-out
are covered by a registration fee of

$4.50.

Campfire Programs Here
AT Silver Tree Camp, of the Glen

Park Playground in San Fran-

enjoy an evening campfire, they come
at 12:30 PM instead of 9 AM and the
coach leaves camp for the return trip at
8 PM. Parents are invited. if:

CHURCH
RECREATION

 

EMARKED A VISITOR to one of the
R church’s newest conference cen-
ters, “But you didn’t tell me

about this!”

“I sent you pictures and tried to de-
scribe the scenic beauty,” was my
rather weak defense.

As she looked around, drinking in the
grandeur of the colorfully banded cliffs
close by, then looking some twenty
miles across a great unspoiled tableland
( mesa, they call it in this Spanish
Southwest), she turned saying: “There
is so much ‘Vicinity’ here!”

Yes, there is a great deal of “vicin-
ity” on these twenty-five thousand acres.

This gift of Ghost Ranch to the Board
of Christian Education of The United
Presbyterian Church in 1954 raised
many questions: What do you do with
twenty-five thousand acres? Its loca-
tion in northern New Mexico is so far
from population centers, who will ever
go there? The answers have come as
some three thousand persons find their
way to Ghost Ranch each summer.
Church people, too, take to the high-
ways and byways in the summer time.
Ours is a mobile population. We have
found, as have the Boy Scouts at their
Philmont Ranch, also in northern New
Mexico, that business and professional
people, Scout committeemen and church
officers will travel to adult training
centers. They seem willing and anxious
to include a conference of a serious
nature in their summer vacation plans.
Church-sponsored family camps and
church-sponsored family conferences
held in a camp setting are a new and
exciting development. The idea of sum-
mer belonging to the children alone
is no longer true. While a Minnesota
church group is raising the money for
development of their six hundred acre

site forty-five families last summer
brought their own trailers and tenting
to try out the area designated for fam-
ilies.

The American Baptist Assembly
grounds comprising some eleven hun-
dred acres on beautiful Green Lake in
Wisconsin offers in its summer pro-
gram meaningful experiences for each
member of the family. Conferences,
training schools, and special courses
for adults in every aspect of the
church’s life and program appeal to
adults. In another area of the pr0perty
is a camp designed for young people
with a continuous program throughout
the summer. The children are enrolled
in a laboratory observation school.

Recreation at the assembly grounds
is geared to persons of all ages, from
a sand box for the tiny tots to an
eighteen-hole golf course for youth and
adults. All the fascination of swimming
and boating are there, too.

SIGNIFICANT IN what I’ve said is the

size of the properties now being
acquired by the church. In 1913, Pres-
byterian churches acquired twelve acres
for a campsite. Their successors in
1958 acquired 417 acres in order to
assure privacy and serve a variety of
program groups and needs on one prop-
erty simultaneously. No longer is the
tract of a few acres satisfactorily suited
to the needs of camping on the scale
envisioned today. Statisticians tell us
that the number of individual boys and
girls attending summer camps spon-
sored by religious groups is now greater
than the attendance at all other camps
put together.

The church program in the out-of-
doors has changed radically from the
turn of the century to now. Some of
the earliest camps in the country were
large assembly grounds, “Bible camps,”
“camp meetings.” A few are still in
operation. The current trend is toward

Maurice D. Bone

a less highly concentrated development

with decentralized units accommodat-
ing forty, fifty, or sixty persons. Several
of these units are often developed in one
property, thus accommodating large
numbers of people but giving more
versatility to the operation.

The program is changing from that
which was sponsored by national, area,
and statewide groups to an increasing
number of events planned and spon-
sored by local churches. Thus, an exist-
ing group within a local church can
have an experience in the out-of-doors
which builds upon and relates to the
life of its group. Program trends also
are moving from the typical traditional
Sunday School class in the out-of-doors
to program that is planned by members
of the group, even including trips. This
means that the facilities now being de-
veIOped are often the launching pad for
traveling groups who want either to
hike on the Appalachian Trail, take a
canoe trip for a week or ten days, a
horseback pack trip, or a trip for which
they pack their own gear on their own
backs. Add to this the possibility of a
car caravan where the group is self con-
tained, provides its own meals as it
travels, and is thus free to visit places of
historic and natural interests relating
religion to all of life about them.

VITAL IN this whole trend is the guid-
ance given by the Committee on
Camps and Conferences of the National
Council of Churches. In c00peration
with the Outdoor Education Associa-
tion, this committee brought a group of
church leaders together in 1951 at Na-
tional Camp near Sussex, New Jersey,
for an experiment in living and learn-
ing in the out-of-doors.

From that springboard came annual
training sessions on a national basis
bringing area leaders of church work
together for a concentrated experience

A surprise gift from George T. Dela-

Company, has assured construction of
an outdoor theater in Central Palk,
New York City. Mr. Delacorte donated

$150,000 to the park department toward
the building of the 2,500-seat theater,
which will provide a setting for the
presentation of concerts, opera, ballet,
and children’s entertainment and will
be a showcase for New York’s free
Shakespeare Festival. It is now hoped
it will be completed by mid-June.

Camping Therapy

Camping as a therapy for delinquent
youngsters has been gaining wideSpread
popularity recently (see also Page 129) .
Legislation now in Congress is designed
to stimulate even a more concentrated
efiort along these lines. In Minneapolis,
Minnesota, the Plymouth Youth Center
sponsors canoe-camping trips for ap-
proximately 150 delinquents from cor-
rectional institutions. Counselors in the
camping program feel that the trips
complement the regular rehabilitation
programs by providing activities eSpe-
cially conducive to a reorientation of
attitude. The wilderness setting is ideal
for a close contact between adult lead-
ers and the youth, a contact extremely

CAMPFIRE EXPERIMENT -

Potential delinquents from a slum area

Sande R. Jones

‘  I  ‘ THE Lower East

 r - Side of New
York City has seen
many a bitter bat-

  

tle — from the
struggle of immi-
grants to improve
their lot and move
to better surroundings to the open war-
fare of street gangs, particularly in the
summertime. During the summer of
1959 the Lower East Side Mission of
Trinity Parish established a teenage
camp further upstate in Dutchess
County.

The response was very encouraging.
Based on a work-type idea, the camp
project met the needs of many of the
youth. For many this was the only
chance they had of getting out of the
city; it gave them a chance to vent
pentup emotions in [a positive way; it
gave them the feeling that here was
something that belonged to them, some-

learn that the out-of-doors offers

greater challenges than city streets

thing they were a part of. They made
numerous suggestions on ways to im-
prove the camp. They built tables and
benches from the trees in the area;
cleared brush and chopped wood; es-
tablished cooking and campfire areas.
During the season much was learned
about what should be incorporated into
a camp program of this type.

The camp is equipped to accommo-
date ten or twelve boys for three~days.
They all sleep in one large tent and
have outdoor toilet facilities and cook-
ing facilities. There is no formal sched-

restful and relaxed pattern.

The camp program is kept down to
three-day periods, because a longer pe-
riod sometimes makes the teenager very

restless. However, during the three-day
period the boys have a wonderful time
and enjoy themselves inmlensely. T hey
are encouraged to do their own cooking
on stone fireplaces. Fireplaces are sup-
plemented by two Coleman gas stoves.
At night the tents are illuminated by

two Coleman gas lanterns. The fellows
enoy sitting around the campfire, tell-
ing jokes and stories. They spend a
great deal of their time reflecting on
what they would be doing if they were
at home; they become relaxed and even
the most introverted become vocal.

The entire format of the camp is
geared to relieve the youth of their
tense or emotional conflicts. They have
an opportunity to go swimming and
fishing in a nearby lake. They get a
big kick out of watching colonies of
ants walking around in their commu-
nity ant hill. It is amazing to see that
the toughest youngster on the streets of
New York is often leary of a bee or a
yellowjacket.

SOME CHARACTERISTICS, pro and con,
of the campers in this particular
age group—thirteen to nineteen—are:
0 They like a work canlp-——a real proj-
ect.

0 They are not prepared for work.

0 They are not skilled.

Achievement is always a great joy.
The boys learn to express them-
selves in. the varied camp activities.

0 They have poor work habits, but they
want to learn and to be independent.

0 They like a minimum of supervision.
0 They don’t like parental attitudes or
sanctions carried over into their camp
life.

0 They are dependent upon each other
and they are cliquish-——one group will
take sides in a dispute against another
group.

The leader must be a good listener.
These boys tend to be extremely moody;
they are bored by repetition and want
to do new things; they resent the leader
taking over. The leader may work
along with them, but must not put him-
self in the position of a director, fore-
man, or supervisor in their work proj-
ects.

The campfire meetings are excellent
and enjoyed by all. The discussion
groups cover a wide range of subjects.
They are extremely talkative, particu-
larly at night. The leader’s reaction to
what they say should be Well channeled
or completely objective, unless there is
a need for him to interpolate in order to
give guidance or correct a bit of mis-
information. Their personal habits are
sometimes poor and they are often care-
less and unkempt; however, upon bring-
lng various constructive suggestions to
them in regards to personal hygiene
and habits, they do a remarkable job of
adjustment. They learn how to express
themselves in various activities. They
take great pride in beginning a project
and carrying it through to completion,
thus proving to themselves and their
friends that they can do decent things
and that they are effective and receive
credit for a job well done.

Operation Nature was continued in
June, July, August, and September
1960, involving seventy-four boys in
camp for three-day periods. The pro-
gram of work, worship, and recreation
went well. Groups were engaged in
building outdoor toilet facilities, a

.kitchen area, and a dining room area.

Of these projects, the most exciting was

the dining room, called the Pine Dine
Room because it was built amid a lovely
pine grove. A circular area was cut in
the pine grove, and the ground cleared
and rolled; two large picnic tables with
benches attached were built. Cool and
shady, the Pine Dine Room was a won-
derful place to eat meals.

IN RUNNING a camp such as this, there

is always the need for expanded
facilities—a new tent, more cots, and
blankets. There is a great need for more
tools; namely, rakes, shovels, saws,
axes, hatchets, ropes, and cooking uten-
sils. Funds are also needed to feed the
boys while they are in camp. A week-
end trip costs approximately $8.00 per
boy. As part of the three-day or week-
end period, the boys have an opportu-
nity to go into the city of Poughkeepsie
to socialize at one of the centers there.
Meeting girls and attending parties is
certainly a part of teenage life. This is
arranged when the opportunity presents
itself.

The character of the boys involved
in Operation Nature was varied. Many
of them were, up to that summer, active
in gangs; others were fairly well
“churched.” By mixing the boys in the
camp setting they learned to make new
friends and to respect the other fellow’s
opinion. They worked and cooked in
groups of three. The boys had an op-
portunity to go swimming and boating
at a nearby lake.

The evening campfire was, by far,
one of the most wonderful times in the
camp session. After dinner, and in the
evening shadows, the boys gathered
around the campfire. There they learned
some of the old campfire songs and
sang a few of their own. It was a fine
time for telling jokes and roasting
marshmallows. To see boys, who would
ordinarily be running in the city streets,
potential victims of gang fights, in-

volved in the calm, peace, and fellow- 

ship of Operation Nature was a gratify-
ing experience. #

I never knew how soothing trees are—many trees, and patches of open

sunlight, and tree presences—it is almost like having another being.

ANGUID, LISTLESS, LACKLUSTER—u—do these adjectives
describe your summer camp program? Are you fresh

out of new ideas to boost their vigor? Before your
activities develop programmatic senility, why not avail your-
self of some rejuvenating aids available from many agencies
and organizations? The inclusion of or omission of any
program activity d0esn’t,imply any recommendation as to
what should or shouldn’t be included in camp program.

Archery—Make your archery program come alive by in-

swinging targets, moving targets, to hold the interest of
your more experienced archers. Join the Camp Archery
Association, 200 Coligni Ave., New Rochelle, New York,

Consider telegraphic and mail matches with other camps
as well as the established regional and national matches.
The secretary of the National Archery Association, 20212

The increasing number of older campers is resulting in
a need for a different approach to archery. Field archery
offers a real potential in these cases. Write National Field

The Conservation Program at Camp

George P. GraH

A well-balanced camping experience

should include conservation activities

138

with a high degree of carryover value.

 

 

CONSERVATION can and often does
play a very important role in the
program of an organized camp. Its ef-
fectiveness depends upon the resource-
fulness and interest of the conservation
staff and the motivating influence which
they can have on the campers. Boys
aged eleven to sixteen often find con-
servation programs so absorbing they prefer projects in-
volving wise use of our natural resources to swimming, boat-
ing, and other popular camp activities.

Conservation experiences received in camp often have a
great degree of carryover value back in the home commu-
nity. Perhaps this is one of the greatest values of a camp
conservation program. What better way to educate the pub-
lic t0 the need of conservation than through “grassroot con-
servation” in the organized camp?

f,

MR. GRAFF is currently working toward his PhD. in con- 
servation education at Ohio State University. He conducted :‘1
the two-year research project on “Conservation in Scout-
ing” for the National Council, Boy Scouts of America.

RECREATION

 

 

Many valuable techniques of applying conservation to
camping was learned during the two-year study on “Con-
servation in Scouting” conducted by the National Council,
Boy Scouts of America, during the summers of 1958-59.
This program, sponsored by the Sport Fishing Institute, en-
abled over forty-six hundred Scouts and Explorers of the
Baltimore Area Council and the Nassau County (New York)
Council to learn about conservation as it applies to their
ca'mping activities. The 1958 study was conducted at the
Broad Creek Memorial Scout Camp, Whiteford, Maryland,
and the 1959 phase of the project was held at the Onteora
Scout Reservation, Livingston Manor, New York.

All conservation programs must be extremely flexible.
Before undertaking any camp conservation program the
following factors must be considered: physical aspects of
the site, biological aspects of the site, and human aspects
and equipment available. Each of the physical and biologi-
cal factors should be studied carefully by a trained profes-
sional person: district forester, district Soil Conservation
Service representative, and wildlife specialist. The camp
director and the camp conservation specialist should study
the human aspect and logistics carefully at the outset of the
program.

Each camp should have the physical and biological fac-
tors studied by resource specialists even if a conservation
program is not anticipated in the camp. These services are
available free of charge by federal and state agencies and
often pay off by saving some serious headaches in the future.
For example, a forestry plan prepared by the district forester
would allow for selective cutting of the timber by which
minimum damage and maximum profit could be obtained.
Even in the cases where no lumbering will be carried out,
as in the wilderness camps, such a plan still makes an ex-
cellent inventory of the forest resources on the property.
The Soil Conservation Service and the state wildlife depart-
ment also will prepare inventories of the property in each
of their respective fields. Such complete records are very
useful in preparing a master conservation plan for the camp.

Assuming that conservation is to be offered as a major
camp activity, the selection of the conservation staff should
be one of the first considerations of the camp director. The
camp conservation director should be a mature person with
considerable education and practical experience in resource

use. A graduate student in conservation would be the most
desirable.

ONE OF THE conservation director’s primary jobs is to

work with professional conservation personnel in set-
ting up land management plans, special-project field days in
various areas and coordinate plans between the camp and
nearby resource agencies. He is often thrown into contact
with neighboring property owners and residents of the com-
munity. Although the camp may be “private” property, the
community is still vitally interested in its use and manage-
ment. Hillsides eroded by campers can silt a stream for sev-

eral miles below the camp and endanger the source of water
for a farmer’s cattle. A small article in the local newspaper
about erosion control projects at the camp can be quite re-
warding in good public relations with the community.

The conservation director must also have the educational
training and technical know-how to carry out an active and
successful program. He must know the signs of overuse or
abuse of a given piece of land and what corrective measures
to take. He must know what jobs are “camper-size” and
what are “man- or machine-size” projects. Nothing can be
more disheartening to a camper than to be given some job
which is impossible to complete or to fail to see some physi-
cal evidence for his efforts.

In all camps at least two members should make up the
conservation staff. If possible, a third member can assist
either on conservation or double in the nature areas. If
nature and conservation are to be included in one general
subject area, then a three-man staff is certainly required.
Perhaps at this point it may be well to distinguish be-
tween nature and conservation. Naturally, they go hand in
hand; but nature usually refers to the identification or tax-
onomy of the plants, animals, and minerals of the areas,
whereas conservation consists of actual practices on the
land; that is, erosion control, reforestation, wildlife habitat
improvement, and fishery management.

The assistant conservation specialists may either be ad-
vanced high school students or undergraduate college stu-
dents. It is desirable that all conservation staff members
have wide and varied interests in conservation. An indi-
vidual who is very outstanding in one specialized area, such
as geology, often has a hard time understanding the many
complex facets of total land use and management.

Availability of the proper equipment to be used in the
conservation program cannot be overemphasized. Many
conservation projects involve construction or building vari-
ous types of shelters. Hand axes, saws, pruning shears,
sickles, and so on are absolutely essential to an effective pro-
gram.

Many of the federal and state agencies, such as the U. S.
Forest Service, state division of forestry, and the Soil Con-
servation Service will furnish equipment on a loan basis
for several weeks or even the entire camping period. Such
contacts are invaluable.

DURING THE PRECAMP TRAINING period, a conservation
training course for all conservation and nature staff
members can be very worthwhile. One of the most effective
type of conservation training courses involves bringing re-
source personnel from the district, the SCS representative,
district forester, and district wildlife Specialist, into camp to
present programs to the conservation and nature staff. Since
the program is given on the same land where the staff will
be working for the entire camping period, a demonstration
forestry plot can he established and forestry methods dis-
cussed. A wildlife habitat area may be established and

139

@ PROGRAM

 

stream improvement principles may even be demonstrated
by such a course.

Conservation is definitely an outdoor activity. Many vital
parts of any conservation program would be lost if any phase
of it would be attempted to be taught indoors; for example,
in a museum. Demonstrations are essential to the conser-
vation area. These must be well done; for example, an ero-
sion-control-check dam can prove completely worthless un-
less large enough logs are used and properly constructed.
The campers must see the correct model and understand
the whys involved before any project is undertaken.

Probably the most effective use of the conservation dem-
onstration area is to give a quick shot in the arm to the
campers regarding conservation at the beginning of the
week or when they are first exposed to it. Eight- to ten-year-
olds should not be kept in the conservation demonstration
area more than thirty minutes and the twelve-to-fifteen age
group should not remain longer than forty-five minutes.
Campers in these age groups want to actively participate and
not become passive spectators. The presentation of materials

in the demonstration area must be rapid and stimulating.

 

If at all possible, the visit to the demonstration area and
a field trip should be accomplished during the same period.
Approximately two hours should be devoted to the two ac-
tivities. On the field trip, the campers can see conservation
in action; they begin to associate the structures seen in the
demonstration area with their correct use on the land. An
excellent way to stimulate camper interaction toward conser-
vation on a field trip is to point out specific projects. For ex-
ample, if when a group of campers complete a conservation
project, they should place their names on a small card or
piece of wood beside the project so that the other campers
will know who built it.

The campers’ interest will be greatly stimulated by know-
ing what project their fellow-campers have done. Care must
be taken, however, to discourage too much competition in
building these projects. A certain amount of competition
can be very good but it can be carried to extremes. Coun-
selors are often guilty of forcing campers into too big a
project just so that they can come up with a project larger
or more attractive that that of their fellow counselors. Con-
servation awards should be discouraged. The reward for
any good conservation project can be seen on the land.

The visit to the conservation demonstration and the field
trip should be followed by the undertaking of a conservation
project. All project sites ought to be selected by the con-
servation staff well in advance. Campers may report directly

to the project site or meet at the conservation demonstration
area and move to the project area as a group.

140

The conservation project is an excellent time to stress
leadership and individual responsibility. Each camper
should be given a job and told what his part will do toward
the success of the entire project. Jobs should be rotated con-
tinuously, thus enabling each camper to have a chance to
work at each task involved.

TO PRODUCE a worthwhile conservation project at least
two to two and a half hours should be spent working on
each project. This time must be divided into shorter peri-
ods; for example, on a stream improvement project the fol-
lowing one-half day programs have been very effective:

1. Short field trip along portion of stream where project
will be carried out (1/2 hour).

2. Fish seining and aquatic sampling to determine ecol-
ogy of the stream  hour) .

3. Construction of rock diverters, V-dams, stream-bank
stabilization, etcetera (1-11/2 hours).

A project in erosion control, building checkdams, can
be handled in the same manner:

1. Short trip about area to determine places of greatest
erosion.

2. Examination of the soil and native vegetation. ‘

3. Construction of checkdams, rock reinforcements, et-

cetera.

HE ESTABLISHMENT of a one-fifth-acre habitat restora-

tion areas in heavily wooded spots is an excellent project
for combining forestry and wildlife management. The pur-
pose of these small open areas is to create “edge effect” or
interspersion needed by many of our game animals.

Not all conservation activities need to be of the construc-
tion type. Activities, such as stream sampling, forest sur-
veys, five-acre surveys of animal signs, fishing derbies and
fish races can add considerable interest and are valuable
assets to a camp conservation program. At one camp, the
weather station, watched daily by the campers, was con-
sidered a conservation project.

Conservation must be a wide and varied program. At
times, it may even overlap into other Specialty areas. How-
ever, the conservation staff and the camp director must be
always aware of “danger signs” in the program.

A few don’ts in any camp conservation program must in-
clude:

0 Don’t select projects which require greater physical
strength than that possessed by the campers.

0 Don’t select projects which will not make a worthwhile
contribution to the camp. For example, digging stumps out
of campsites often goes under the label of conservation,
when actually this activity promotes unknown amounts of
soil erosion from camps each year.

0 Don’t select projects which cannot be completed because
of inadequate tools and equipment available.

0 Don’t select project which takes too long to complete. Re-
member, most campers still have rather short attention
spans.

0 Don’t select a project which will monopolize the camp-
er’s time to such an extent that it will keep them from par-
ticipating in a “balanced” camping experience. if:

MARCH 1961

 

Unique facility blazes a new trail

capped children in a community set-
ting.

The Nassau County Cerebral Palsy
Association in Roosevelt, New York,
has added this new facility to its treat-
ment center and school for cerebral
palsy children and adults residing in
Nassau County. This agency, through
the efforts of its board of directors, ad-
ministrative staff and other personnel,
has taken positive measures to assure
comprehensive and unusual recreation
facilities for its patients.

Situated behind the cerebral-palsy
center, the playground is composed of
a group of independent circular areas
connected by wide semi-paved paths.
Each circular area about fifty feet in
diameter Will be equipped with items
suitable for particular activities and a
particular age group. One area con-
tains the slide which is built into a
mound on the ground. The slide has
two graduated approach ramps. one
with handrails and the other with mul-
tiple-colored poles. There is an over-

head rail on the top to help the children
sit down and left and right handrails
for gripping while sliding down. The
ground level is slightly higher than the
slide, making it impossible for a child
to fall off.

A second grouping includes a wide
bicycle path around the outer rim of a
circle with the center containing ade-
quately spaced multicolored metal poles
which form a maze through which the
children can propel or pull themselves
in a variety of games. such as chase and
follow-the-leader. A large open metal
playhouse is located in this area. ena-

Another is called the water-and-sand
play area and includes waterwa)s and
sand dunes on tables built at a height
which will enable the children to reach
acress or follow the path of their boats
downstream in their wheelchairs or on
crutches. This area will also have twu

under the boards when desiring to use
them.
An unusual piece of equipment is

called the mountain-climber, a series of
colored metal steps with nonslip footing
which ascends gradually to a platform
and then down the other side. Rails
formed by heavy rope support the chil-
dren in climbing. The total effect of
mountain climbing will motivate many
of these children into a needed rehabili-
tation technique while having fun.

One of the areas includes concrete
circular tables, adjusted by heights, so
that the handicapped children can use
some for quiet game play, some for
climbing or sitting, and others as tables
for games or eating. Other areas con-
tain playground pieces such as magic
forests, play shelters, and several multi-
colored networks for climbing through,
under, and above. These have been ad-
justed so that in some cases children in
wheelchairs can navigate under or
around them while ambulatory children
can climb through or over. These play-
scapes are interesting, challenging, and
functional. These pieces are all made of
metal which is light, durable, colorful,
and practically maintenance-free.

THE CEREBRAL-PALSY CENTER oper-

ates its summer day camp in a
wooded area behind the association
buildings. The center authorities and
board of directors after viewing the
prepared playground plans, commis-
sioned David Aaron of Playground
Corporation of America to make plans
for the combined playground, summer
day camp area, and landscaping for the
entire project. The completed plan now
incorporates the playground areas ad-
jacent to the camp site with grassed
mounds and hedges screening the camp-
ers’ View of the playground and the
buildings. Final plans included an out-
door stage with ramps, movable back-
dr0ps, and a stone campfire area—all
of which faces a large space for seats
and wheelchairs for shows, plays, mu-
sicals.

The camp site, all in the woods, in-
cludes large tents placed on “wood plat-
forms flush with the ground. An eating
and fireplace area with concrete round
tables of various heights is situated in
a clearing. A crafts area with a small
equipment storage house, a cleared area
with a platform base to hold the giant
plastic swimming pool used in the sum-

 

mer program, and another open area

for showers coming out ‘of the curved-
shaped piping around a circle are pro-
vided.

An unusual feature of the camp is
the conversion of an old concrete foun-
dation into a fishing hole. The entire
fishing site is enclosed and covered with
a log roof for shade. The children
wheel onto a wide protected ramp and
fish through screened openings. The
building can be easily locked at the end
of the day.

All of the camp facilities are con-
nected by a series of paved paths
through the woods and several of the
paths end in a large circular area for
turning around. These paths can be
used for nature lore and hiking, as well
as for locating specific areas.

This plan should motivate cerebral
palsy and other handicapped children’s
organizations in this country to provide
similar facilities for their children. Cit- ‘
ies and other communities contemplat- 3
ing play facilities which could be used
simultaneously by normal and handi-
capped children in normal recreation
settings may well meet their needs by
utilizing facilities of this type. #

WATER . . .
The Life Blood of the Camp

F YOU have ever gone through a time
I of very acute water scarcity, you
know all too well that water is
truly the life blood of the camp. In the
selection of a camp site, the availability
of good water has highest priority.
Water provides for cooking, drinking,
washing, the transportation of human
wastes, and pleasant activities such as
swimming, boating, and fishing. The
value and beauty of a camp depend
largely upon pure and abundant water.
Campers should be taught economi-
cal use of water. In arid lands such
education is especially necessary. But
even where water is abundant, campers
should treat it with respect, should not

waste it, and should help to keep its
source clean.

Water for Domestic Use

Water needs vary tremendously.
Camps with their own laundries and
with dishwashing machines may need
up to 150 gallons per person per day,
whereas camps with neither running
water nor flush toilets may allow only
five gallons per person daily for cook-
ing and drinking. The average range is
between thirty and ninety gallons, with
fifty gallons considered adequate in the
camp which uses both flush toilets and
pit latrines.

Unless they use city water supplies,
camps get their water from wells,
springs, cisterns, lakes, ponds, streams,
and canals. Water frOm any of these
sources may be unsafe, but water that
comes from surface sources is most
suspect.

Ground water is the preferred source
of water for domestic uses in camp.
This is water obtained from under-
ground sources, such as wells. It comes
from rain and melting snow which has
seeped into the ground down to the

ford Woods, Indiana, 1960).
I MARCH 1961

ground water table (the level at which
the space between the soil particles is
filled with water). If the water has fil-
tered through a sufficient depth of tight,
clean soil, impurities may be elimi-
nated and the water may be safe for
drinking without treatment.

However, purity of ground water
cannot be taken for granted. Some-
times underground channels permit wa-
ter to travel some distance without fil-
tering. Sometimes the water becomes
polluted when it is brought to the sur-
face. In any case, the water source
must be protected, and the water must
be tested before its use is permitted and
at frequent periods thereafter.

Dug wells are considered less satis-
factory than drilled wells because they
are open to contamination. Wells
should be developed from sources at
least ten feet and preferably twenty feet
underground. Because of the lack of
surface protection, springs are more
apt to become contaminated than wells.

Surface water usually contains large
quantities of bacteria and is sometimes
polluted by sewage and industrial
wastes. Such water should be used for
domestic purposes in camp only if
ground water cannot be obtained.
Chlorination and filtration are abso-
lutely necessary before it is used.

Water for Camp Program

Swimming, boating, and fishing de-
pend upon good water. Both the quan-
tity and quality are important. Unless
a camp is in an isolated area or owns
the lands comprising its watershed, its
water may become polluted from
sources outside the camp and from
causes beyond its control, such as de-
struction of vegetation on the water-
shed because of overgrazing, fire, and
lumbering; pollution from sewage and
industrial wastes. Pollution is now
such a problem that many authorities
recommend that a camp build an arti-

EgADMINISTRATION

 

ficial swimming pool rather than use
natural areas with their attendant prob-
lems.

Saving the soil on the banks of
streams, ponds, and lakes will also help
protect the water. The banks may be
planted with seed, sod, and trees.

Beaches: Normal care of beaches will
include provision of trash containers
at convenient locations; removal of
debris, papers, garbage, dead fish, cans,
glass, nails, etcetera, as promptly as
possible by means of rakes or sand
sifters; prohibition of fires or picnics
on swimming beaches. Concrete
beaches have been used for areas that
suffer from heavy erosion.

Water plants: Water plants in mod-

erate amounts are valuable in natural
waters, since they:

0 Provide food and shelter and nests
for ducks and geese.

0 Serve as food for muskrats.

0 Help to stabilize eroding areas.

0 Shelter small fish and provide the
shade needed by certain fish.

0 Provide (through photosynthesis)
oxygen needed by fish.

0 Create beauty and variety.

However, if unchecked, water plants

may become overabundant and:

o Injure or destroy fishing.

0 Cause an overpopulation of small.
stunted fish.

a Decrease (through decomposition)
the oxygen supply.

0 Become unsightly and odorous.

0 Block swimming and boating.

o Eventually choke a body of water
and fill it up.

Calm, shallow, sunny waters, with
rich bottoms, favor the development of
aquatic plant life. Deep waters, low in
nutrients, exposed to wind, with rocky
or gravelly bottoms. are relatively‘free
from plant growth. Detergents are
thought to stimulate the growth of al-

gae in water. #

cial lessons learned in group
living in a well-organized overnight
camp, experience proves that a high-
quality day camp can and does provide
an enriching experience in the lives of
the participants. At Tanglewood Day
Camps in The William and Kate B.
Reynolds Memorial Park in Clemmons,
North Carolina, eleven hundred rolling
acres provide a marvelous setting for
boys and girls to learn the secrets of
outdoor living. The setting is a pri-
vately endowed public park, ten miles
west of Winston-Salem. The park, cre-
ated by the Wills of the late William N.
and Kate B. Reynolds, was first opened
to the public in 1954. Since the park
receives no tax support whatsoever, the
day camps must support themselves.
In order to assure high quality, the
camp fee is considerably higher than
other day camps in the area  $30.00 for
two weeks). Many peOple experienced
with day camping said the fee was un-
reasonable, that parents would not pay
that much for a day camp. This cer-

growth. From one camp with 159
campers in 1955, Tanglewood has
grown to three camps with 460 campers
in 1960. Because the high camp fee
legislates against some children attend-
ing camp, a limited number of camper-
ships are available for deserving chil-
dren.

The three camps include: Camp
Cherokee for seven- to nine-year-olds;
Camp Catawba for ten- to twelve-year-
olds and Teen Camp for thirteen- to
seventeen-year-olds. By such homoge-
neous grouping the program is designed
to more realistically meet the needs of
a particular age group. Since the seven-
to nine-year-olds are not able to select
their own activities intelligently, Camp
Cherokee schedules all activities, aim-
ing to give campers a good introduction
to many activities. The program in-
cludes a balanced program of crafts,
archery, swimming, nature lore, camp-
craft, pony riding, music, dance, drama,
and low-organization games. This var-
ied program does not allow for much
specialization in a particular activity,
but We do not feel that this is desirable
with this age group.

S PECIAL CAMP-WIDE activities add im-

measurably to the total camp pro-
gram. One of the special activities for
Camp Cherokee is a hayride in a mule-
drawn hoover cart. On rainy days the
campers enjoy frolicking in the hay in
one of the large barns. Other special
events which have been used with con-
siderable success are a gorilla ( a male
counselor) hunt and a dinosaur egg
(watermelon) hunt.

In Camp Catawba (ten- to twelve-
year-olds) emphasis is placed on nature
and camp-craft activities supplemented
by sports, crafts, rifiery, golf instruc-
tion, horseback riding instruction, ca-
noeing, swimming, and archery. This
is a free-choice program where the
camper himself plans his own schedule.
One campcraft project undertaken byv
this age group was to recondition an "M
old covered wagon in the park. The
youngsters repaired, refinished, and
then painted the wagon. Another group
built a tree house. One of the high-
lights of each camp session is a medley .

RECREATION

relay of campcraft activities or a camp-
craft rodeo. These boys and girls also
build their own campsites and spend
one night camping in the park during
each two-week session.

The Teen Camp program is also free
choice and is centered around aquatics.
The teenagers receive beginning and
advanced instruction in water skiing,
canoeing, and swimming. They also
participate in horseback riding, golf,
riflery, archery, and a wide variety of
sports. These boys and girls plan and
take overnight camping trips to the
mountains. Last year a qualified group
of boys and girls took a very exciting
fifty-mile overnight canoe trip down

the Yadkin River.

IF THERE IS A SINGLE KEY to the suc-
cess of Tanglewood’s day camp pro-

grams, it is leadership. The counselor-

camper ratio is one counselor for every

seven campers. No counselor is ever

responsible for more than twelve camp-

ers at a time. This gives the counselor
the opportunity to conduct an activity
that is of the highest quality.

Most day camps have a disadvantage
in finding good counselors because of
lack of housing facilities and Tangle-
wood faces the same problem. All of
the counselors come from within a fif-
teen-mile radius of the park. It is diffi-
cult to find men and women with good
camping experience in such a small
area. The great majority of the coun-
selors are teachers from the Winston-
Salem or Forsyth County Schools. Al-
though they are the best single resource,
there is danger in using school teachers
in a camping program. There is vast
difference between a good school
teacher and a good camp counselor.
There is a danger of having a highly
regimented activity certainly not wanted
in a camp program. A good camp ex-
perience is a learning experience, not
accomplished through classroom meth-
ods, but through motivation of the inner

 

 

EgADMINIS TRATI ON

 

drives of the camper to explore areas
of personal interest in an informal
manner.

In order to develop good counselors
Tanglewood provides a good staff train-
ing program at the beginning of the
season and an in-service training pro-
gram as the season progresses. In the
pre-camp staff training we seek not
only to acquaint counselors with rou-
tine camp procedures, but also to imbue
them with the aims and objectives of
the total day-camp program and with
each individual program area. During
the season we hold weekly staff meet-
ings to discuss program and suggest
ways and means to strengthen weak
programs.

As a result Tanglewood offers a day-
camp experience with leadership and
program content equal to many organ-
ized overnight camps. Its emphasis on
the right philosophy, proper leadership,
and high-quality program results in a
rewarding experience for everyone. #

CAMPING LAB for OUTDOOR EDUCATION

UTDOOR EDUCATION has been an
0 integral part of the higher ed-
ucation program at Southern Illinois
University for the past eleven years.
The SIU Recreation and Outdoor Edu-
cation Department has established a
unique laboratory for learning and liv-
ing out-of-doors based on the principle
that people learn by doing.

The “Little Giant” Camp was estab-
lished at Giant City State Park for those
interested in rehabilitation and handi-
capped children. This services three
different types of campers: the mentally
retarded, sponsored by the Egyptian As-
sociation for the Mentally Retarded;
those with speech and hearing impedi-
ments, sponsored by the University of
Illinois Division of Services for Crip-
pled Children; and the orthOpedically
handicapped, sponsored by the South-
ern Illinois Easter Seal Society. Last
year the camp was moved to Little
Grassy Campus while a dining hall,
lounge, cabins, and therapy center was
made ready to move into.

MARCH 1961

The Grassy Lake Camp, on the other
hand, serves boys and girls aged nine to
fourteen from Southern Illinois. Per-
manent structures and buildings are be-
ing steadily included and, when the
master plan is completed, this lakeside
site will be the central area for the en-
tire outdoor education program.

Because the outdoor education pro-
gram is primarily for leadership train-
ing, a hundred campers is maximum for
each camp. Over a period of years the
counselor training program has de-
veloped until it now offers twenty-two
courses in eleven different fields, geolo-
gy, geography, education, sociology,
music, industrial education, psychology,
Speech, health education, physical edu-
cation, recreation, outdoor education.

Before the actual camping period be-
gins for the campers, the students have
a two week pre-camp training session,
thus making eight in all. The first two
weeks are devoted to concentrated theo-
ry, and the other six putting it to work.

Each student counselor is responsible

for a certain phase of the program and
rotates into different activities and ad-
ministrative positions. The camp pro-
grams for both normal and handicapped
children are similar, with one exception:
the “Little Giant”

therapy program each morning.

Camp Operates a

This type of learning-tlirough-doing
has many values. Camp, as a living situ-
ation, offers a provocative environment
for gaining knowledge of children,
studying their growth, development,
and needs. It also provides an opportu-
nity to obtain knowledge of the group
process and the techniques through
which the informal cainp group can
make its greatest contribution to the in—
dividual.

One of the greatest needs today, re-
gardless of field, is skilled and consci-
entious leadership. We believe our out-
door education program is a very sound
approach in developing good leadership
for tomorrow—LOREN E. TAYLOR,

California’s Recreation Plan
THE STUDY THAT resulted in the California Public Out-

door Recreation Plan represents a comprehensive

attempt to plan for meeting statewide recreation
needs of the public on an intergovernmental basis. Part 1*
of the plan report is presented in an unusually attractive
form. It contains colorful illustrations, photographs, dia-
grams, maps and charts, and is obviously designed to enlist
public interest and support. Part 2* of the plan, just re-
leased, contains further data and supporting maps, charts,
inventories and results of survey in which nearly one to
two million people expressed their views on the state’s
problems.

The plan encompasses the principal types of outdoor
recreation: travel and sightseeing, picnicking, camping,
riding, hiking, swimming, boating, fishing, hunting, and
winter activities. The report includes a discussion of the
expanding needs for recreation through increased leisure
time, mobility and expendable income. It places strong em-
phasis on the need for all levels of government to do their
share and to encourage private enterprise on government
and other lands.

Part 1 of the plan is not overburdened with statistics,
but it does include significant figures on participation in
various forms of outdoor recreation. It points out, for ex-
ample, that today 55,000 public picnic sites are available
in California, whereas in 1980 over 150,000 will be needed.
The 29,000 present camp sites affording 13,000,000 camper-
days are overused as much as thirty percent. There are
nearly as many horses for riding pleasure—over 268,000—
as there are pleasure boats in California. In 1958, 1,200,000
went to the mountains to play in the snow.

Of special interest to recreation authorities are the stand-
ards that are proposed fOr several types of recreation facili-
ties, as follows:

Picnic grounds within communities, designed to accom-
modate family groups, should be planned within these
limits: (1) not more than sixteen picnic units per acre;
(2) each unit to accommodate a maximum of eight persons;
(3) sufficient units so that each is used no more than six
hundred visitor days each season; and (4) one parking
space for each unit. Picnic grounds for large Organized
groups within the community should be planned to accom-
modate two hundred persons on each acre. One-third acre of

parking space, accommodating fifty cars, should be planned
for each group picnicking area.

*Available from Department of Natural Resources, 722 Capitol

Avenue, Room 3076, Sacramento 14, California. Paper, $2.00 (each
part).

146

Outside the community, the space allowed should be
greater: eight units per acre is recommended, with one
parking space for each unit. The maximum safe use of
these areas should be calculated at four hundred visitor
days per unit per season; beyond that, the facilities are
subject to overuse. For wayside rests, along major high-
way routes, units should be planned at a maximum density
of sixteen to the acre, with no fewer than four units at a
single location.

Campgrounds at vacation spots (“destination camps")
should have no more than four camp units per acre, with
each unit designed to accommodate at least four persons,
giving enough space for access, auxiliary facilities, screen-
ing, and a necessary buffer strip between camp units. Camp
acres used primarily by the camper en route can have as
many as ten camp units per acre.

For shoreline swimming, ten effective feet will provide
Space for twenty persons at any one time. One effective
foot of shoreline is defined as comprising one lineal foot
of shore with a hundred-foot-wide band of water suitable
for swimming. It has a two hundred-foot-wide strip of
beach for sunbathing and play, and a hundred-foot-wide
buffer zone for utilities and picnicking. Where all attend-
ance is by automobile, an additional 265-f00t strip is needed
for parking. Each thousand people need twenty-live effec-
tive feet of shoreline. The effective foot is used as a standard
against which all existing and potential shoreline swimming
areas are rated. . . . On a typical summer weekend day, ten
effective feet of shoreline can be used by sixty persons,
since a turnover rate of three is to be expected. Each ten
such effective feet will park five cars. A forty percent over-
load of both people and cars can be handled on peak days.
For each four hundred persons in the population, these ten
effective feet, if properly located, will meet the shoreline
swimming requirements.

The standard neighborhood pool is about eighteen hun-
dred square feet in size. One such pool is required in each
neighborhood of about thirty-two hundred people, located
within walking distance of most of their homes. A larger
community pool should be about forty-five hundred square
feet in size. It should serve a community of about twenty-
five thousand people within a radius of about two miles.

So You Think
Your Camp

Is Insured?

OST CAMP DIRECTORS throughout the country are now
M aware that, in the insurance field, there are certain
masts if they are to accept their moral and financial
responsibilities to campers and staff, as well as to property.
Among these are:
Camper’s Medical I nsnrance—In this, the camper is usually
covered up to the policy limits for injuries sustained while
travelling to, attending, and returning from camp and for
the expense of treatments received within twenty-six weeks
from the date of the accident. Under a sickness provision
hospital, nurse, medical and surgical expense resulting from
sickness is covered, from sickness contracted and for which
first medical treatment is received during the camper’s term
of insurance. In addition, acéidental death and dismember-
ment benefits are often included.

Several additional important features of camper’s medi-
cal insurance are:

1. The adult members of your camp staff can also be in-
cluded. Accidents and sicknesses may occur in this adult
group during the summer, many times when they are off
duty and therefore are not covered by Workmen’s Compen-
sation. Besides, most illnesses are excluded under the com-
pensation contract. By having both the Workmen’s Com-
pensation and the camper’s medical insurance, these staff
members are then covered quite fully and the camp director
is thus relieved of the moral, if not the legal, obligation to
provide medical attention when trouble occurs.

2. Camper’s Medical is often a prerequisite for compre-
hensive general liability policies since it is self evident that
many incipient liability claims are satisfactorily settled
through these medical payments.

Fire Insurance—For some reason fire insurance on camp
property is universally neglected. Camps should have their
property appraised every three years.

Consider writing fire insurance on a blanket basis, with
ninety percent of the sound value of all buildings and con-
tents covered. The advantages of this method are many,
but most specifically, should one or two buildings burn
completely, the coverage provides a hundred percent re-
placement of these buildings although only ninety percent
of the total values are insured. New buildings and additions
are automatically picked up by the terms of the policy.

Those camps who do not feel they can afford ninety per-
cent coverage can have their property written on a schedule,
with a definite amount applying to each building. If the

son, Whitridge & Reid, Inc.

property has been adequately appraised, one way to set the
amount of insurance is to take a straight percentage of each
building appraised in order to get some coverage on each
property. Other camp owners try to put proper coverage
on the most valuable building and allow some of the less
valuable buildings to remain uninsured. Contents in any
event should not be insured in each building but on a
blanket basis throughout the camp.

In some states tents, boats, canoes, camp and athletic
equipment can. be lumped as one item on a blanket basis at
a slightly lower rate. Tents, sports and athletic equipment
may be better written on an all-risk floater and boats and
canoes on an all-risk marine floater since these items are
subject to perils other than fire. The eXpense of this addi-
tional coverage is only slightly higher.

The extended coverage endorsement, which includes
Windstorm coverage, has become almost a necessity.

There are many ways to budget fire insurance costs. Be

sure to check with your insurance agent about the avenues
open to you. '
Liability Except Aatomobile—-—The only coverage for a camp
is the comprehensiveliability contract; and the only way
to cover camps completely for liability is for each camp
owner or director to fill out an exhaustive questionnaire
which discloses every hazard. Unless this is done, many of
the contracts may contain specific exclusions for the haz-
ards common to these camps, such as boat hazards, saddle
horses, products off the premises, malpractice, etcetera. If
all known hazards are properly covered with the prOper
charge for them, then the camp is completely protected for
all of these known hazards, and through the comprehensive
feature of the liability policy, for any new or unknown haz-
ard, not specifically excluded. The final premium charge is
determined by an audit.

The properly insured camp will show in its liability con-
tract year-round premise coverage and any off-premise
property specifically mentioned, such as an oflice in a home,
or oflice building, a camping site, and any other prOperty
owned, leased or rented, which might include laundries,
Grange halls and beaches. All canoes, rowboats, sailboats,
inboards and outboards, should be declared in the contract,
also the total number of saddle animals, whether owned or
hired. One of the most frequent omissions in liability con-
tracts is the sending of children to riding academies. The
riding schools generally do not have insurance, and even if
they do, the responsibility of the camp does not cease when
the director delivers a camper to a riding academy.

Products liability covering food handling and consump-
tion on and off the premises should be mentioned, and con-
tingent malpractice coverage should also be shown. Even
though you do not have a camp physician, every good camp
has at least one doctor on call. Every doctor and nurse
should have a malpractice policy of his or her own, but
some of them do not, and should they treat a camper im-
properly or fail to give the proper treatment, the camp

might be in trouble. H

14-7

All camps should carry property damage of at least
$0,000. You never know where these property damage acci-
dents are going to come from but they can be very serious.
Sailboats, inboards and outboards can do considerable dam-
age to other craft and piers. Campers passing through other
people’s property have been known to damage that property,
and injure domestic animals. The main reason for recom-
mending it is the forest-fire hazard. There have been cases
where a bad forest fire has led straight back to an unextin-
guished camp fire where campers had either spent the night
or cooked a meal. Such a claim could be a serious one.
Workmen’s Compensation—The Workmen’s Compensation
Acts of each state vary so in benefits, limits of medical pay-
ments, rates, and requirements that make the act compulsory
that it would be impractical to relate them here. The re-
quirements of each state may be compulsory and it is wise
to check with your company or agent as to your own pr0per
standing.

Counsellors-in-training are a touchy subject since there
has never been a clear-cut decision in many states as to
whether they are employees or campers. Since the camp
exercises supervision and control of these counsellors-in-
training, they probably should be insured under compensa-
tion.

Automobile Liability—It is recommended that this coverage
be put on a comprehensive automobile liability basis wher-
ever possible. This permits new cars to be automatically
insured, and permits pro rata premiums for short term cov-
erage which, of course, is generally the rule in summer
camps. The audit determines the date the car goes on the
road and when it is taken off. A hired car and non-owner-
ship endorsement should be included which would cover the
camp for all contingencies involving counselors” cars not
properly covered by their own insurance. It would also pro-
tect the camp for its contingencies in the use of buses and
hired cars. Camp directors, owner’s cars, and counselors’
cars, if used for the transportation of campers, should have
the so-called camp bus endorsement. Again the limits of
the camp’s automobile liability policy should be high, for
when bad accidents occur, large groups are generally in-
volved.

Automobile Fire and Theft—Camp-owned vehicles should
be covered for comprehensive fire and theft, for even though
stored on the premises during the winter they can burn or
be stolen. If reasonably new they should also have collision
coverage, for repairs and replacements in bad accidents can
be very expensive. If the camp owns five or more cars and
trucks, fleet rates are available.

Miscellaneous Coverage—Look into your needs for crime
protection. Although companies are not overly interested
in issuing it, there are many requests for various forms of
burglary insurance. Burglary and theft can now be written
blanket on all contents throughout a camp except on an
owner’s residence. In Massachusetts it can be written on
the regular residence burglary policy or endorsement. In
addition, the camp may wish to protect itself if it has a
safe. Some of the larger camps carry interior or exterior

robbery insurance and fidelity bonds on all employees han-
(lling money.

148

Another possible liability of the camp is its responsibility
for the personal effects of the campers and for those of par-
ents while visiting the camp. If loss occurs by fire or any
of. the perils of the extended coverage endorsement, there is
legal liability protection under your fire contents policy. If
you are a large camp it might be better to write a separate
contents fire contract specifically declared to cover the prop-
erty of campers and guests. Some companies issue a special
campers’ personal effects floater at so much per camper.
Campowner’s Policy—One large company has agreed to
write the proposed new campowner’s policy on one contract.
As far as is known, this is the first package contract ever
offered in this country to the camp owners and could easily
become an all-risk policy if widely accepted. It includes:

1. All of the building fire insurance.
2. All of the contents fire insurance.
3. All the hazards of the extended coverage #4 en-

dorsement.
4. Camp burglary and theft.
5. Comprehensive public liability.
6. Tuition fees and extra expense.

7. Water damage from the plumbing or heatingisystem
or from a domestic appliance.

8. Bursting of any boiler or hot-water storage or heating
system.

9. Vandalism or malicious mischief.

10. Motor vehicle damage including damage by owner’s
vehicles.

11. Falling of trees.

12. Objects falling from the weight of ice, snow or sleet.

13. The freezing of plumbing or heating systems or do-
mestic appliances.

14. Collapse of buildings-or any part thereof. including
collapse caused by weight of ice, snow, or sleet.

15. Landslide.
16. Breaking of glass.

17. Limited marine cover for boats.

18. Transportation of luggage, supplies and equipment.
There are several limitations to these coverages and some

of them carry the $50.00 deductible clause.

The limits and extensions of the amounts applying to
building and contents are as follows:

1. Ten percent of the face of the policy will apply to
tuition fees and extra expense.

2. Five percent of the face of the policy will apply to
burglary and theft.

3. The liability coverage will be attached to the camp-
owner’s policy and separately rated.

4. The transportation hazard is limited to $1000. The
premium for this policy would be less than the premiums
for the separate coverages if purchased through individual
contracts. The liability portion of the contract would be
subject to annual audit.

Investigate the possibilities of comprehensive coverage
with your own insurance company, and see if these possi-
bilities merit careful consideration. They will probably
offer you many worthwhile advantages. #

IND IAN GAMES

Land and water contests for the camp braves

Allan Macfarlan

THE LAND and water games of the
American Indian are almost cus-
tom made for camp programs. Indians,
young and old alike, were very fond
of games of all sorts. They had special
games to play at certain seasons of the
year and indoor games for the long

 

winter evenings in their lodges. After
active games, which were the favorite pastime among all
but the older men, came guessing games, and they were
played with a patience and persistence that is unbelievable.
The Indians ran, wrestled, jumped, putted heavy stones, and
contested in swimming, canoe races, and water games when
tribes were close to a lake, river, or ocean. Typical of such
games and contests are the following:

LOG PUSH RACE—Two, three, or four swimmers push a
log, broadside on, in front of them, holding the top of thc
log with both hands and swimming forward only with the
feet. Each team contests against one or more teams. All
teams start from the samc starting line and each team pushes
a log of the same wood, the same length, and as far as pos-
sible, of about the same weight and girth. The distance for
this race can range from twenty to fifty yards, according

eler, is currently professor of British and French literature

to the ages of the bands participating. Races with only one
brave to a short log can also be contested, using light logs
of about the same size.

LOON RACE—The swimmers take a deep breath and try

to swim twenty yards, breast stroke, just under the water
all the way. When a swimmer comes to the surface he is
disqualified. The length of this race is decided by the
ability of the contestants.

OTTER SLIDE—A synthetic otter slide, built into a lake

or river bank, provided there is a suitable spot for it, is a
source of fun which every bravc will enjoy. The slide
should be cut into a rather high bank at a suflicient angle
to assure a speedy ride down the chute from the top of the
bank into the lake or stream, which should be fairly deep
at the spot where the “otters” hit the water.

It is difficult to find a really suitable bank for the slide,
but one can usually be found somewhere in the vicinity of
the encampment. A chute with a heavy clay content is the
best and easiest to keep in good shape for sliding. The slide
should end where the water is at least three feet deep and
clear of rocks. The depth can be much greater and is best
decided by the ability and age of the otters using the slide.
Strict supervision is required at all times when the slide is
being used, not only to make certain that no brave gets into
difliculties in the water at the end of the slide but also to
keep the sliders far enough apart during the descent to as-

sure safe smooth sliding.
While the slide down the chute can be made sitting down

149

and with no other equipment than that provided by nature,
the ride down can also be made on boards. These slide-
boards should be perfectly smooth, strong, and thin, about
two and a half feet long and from fourteen to eighteen
inches wide. There should be a six-inch length of fairly
heavy rope, knotted at the holding end, fastened to the edge
of the floor of the board on each side, to serve as a hand
hold. The sliding boards must be slightly turned up in
front, and a little steaming and bending will do this. The
width of the chute should not be more than three feet. On a
really good clay slide which is frequently inspected by a
chief, sliders can slide down lying on their bellies as well
as in a sitting position, the clay which they pick up on the
way down being speedily washed off when they hit the
water.

 

When suitable planks are available and there is a carpen-
ter to supervise the building of the slide, one may build a
wooden-surfaced slide onto an earth or any other sort of
bank, provided the slant is suitable, but this artificial chute
is not nearly so satisfactory as one provided by nature, with
a little help from the chiefs. When a plank chute is con-
structed, it is always much safer to build it on top of a slop-
ing bank, which serves as a surer foundation, because a
chute built on trestles can be unsafe unless built by chiefs
with a thorough knowledge of carpentry. Some smooth
metal can be used to surface a slide, provided it has neither
rough edges nor oints.

RAVEN TAG—Recently, the author watched small hands
of ravens playing various tag games high above the treetops
on Graham Island, in the Queen Charlotte Islands, British
Columbia, Canada. Watching them at play, it was easy to
see why not only the Indians of the Northwest Coast but
also other tribes from many habitats credited these big
black birds with a sense of intelligence, craftiness, and
humor. Among the tag games these birds played was the
simple form of tag enjoyed by human beings. One raven
was It and he endeavored to tag any one of the flock of
about ten players from above or below, or some unexpected
direction. The bird tagged took up the chase instantly with-
out question. It was thrilling to watch the great birds far-
thest from the tagger soar and circle in apparent unconcern
until threatened, and then drop swiftly through the air or
take off with powerful wingbeats to avoid the pursuer.
Some ravens tagged with their beaks, but many of the tag-

150

gers seemed to enjoy plummeting on a victim from above
and striking it so sharply with their feet that it was thrown
off balance for a moment before it could take up the chase.

One of the games played by these raven bands has been
enjoyed by modern Indians. This is how they played. One
raven, chosen as It, would carry a short stick or pine cone
in its beak. All of the other players would then wing off in
full flight. It flew swiftly after the fleeing flock and, when
he came alongside any one of the players, held out the stick,
which the other raven took immediately. The new It then

“took up the chase while the pursued dodged and sideslipped

so that It could not come alongside. The birds cawed and
croaked with delight as they played, and especially when
some unlucky bird was taken off guard or was nearly
knocked out of the air by an energetic tagger.

Here is the game suggested for modern Indian bands. It

carries a stick about six inches long and one and a half
inches in diameter, rounded at both ends. When he actually
comes alongside any one of the players pursued, he slips the
stick into that player’s hand and the new tagger takes over
without question. This stick-passing tag is a test of good
sportsmanship, since a tagger neither pokes the player whom
he is after in the back nor expects him to turn around and
take the tagger’s stick as he races along ust behind him. It
also has the chance not to show impatience when the hoped-
for victim swerves unexpectedly, making it impossible for
the pursuer to come directly alongside.
HOOP AND BALL—Many Indian tribes played games with
hoops of various kinds. The game which follows was a
favorite with a number of tribal groups. The players form
two straight lines about thirty feet apart and with about
two feet between the players in each line. Each line of
players is given a large ball and an instructor rolls a small
wooden hoop, large enough for the ball to pass through
fairly easily, between the two lines of players. Modern
Indians can use a metal hoop, about eighteen inches in
diameter, as a substitute when necessary. The leader rolls
the hoop with a short stick, keeping it within his reach and
under control. He either rolls it up and down halfway be-
tween the two lines or weaves in and out toward each line,
daring the braves to throw the balls through the hoop as
it rolls. The players must remain in line, especially when
they throw a ball at the hoop. Any player who puts a ball
through the hoop when he has stepped out of line is dr0pped
from the game. This stresses the discipline aspect of the
game, as it is hard not to step out of line in order to get a
better, or closer, throw at the moving hoop. The halls
should be thrown or rolled to and from between the two
lines so that as many braves as possible get the chance to
try their marksmanship. When a ball strikes the hoop rim
and knocks the hoop over the game stops until the hoop is
rolling again.

This game is more difficult when the instructor orders
that the ball be thrown with both hands from the overhead
position or in some other special way. No player should
throw at the hoop twice in succession. The task of the hoop
roller is to keep the hoop in constant motion as trickily as
possible, stopping it for a moment unexpectedly or making
it swerve suddenly so that a thrown ball misses its mark.

RECREATION

FEATHER RACE—This was a

race enjoyed by Indian boys and
each boy brought his own feathers.
The ones used by modern Indians
can either be crow or chicken
feathers, and the chief should
either have each brave bring his
own feather or have enough clean-
tip chicken feathers on hand for several races. The feathers
are stuck lightly into the ground in a straight line, facing
a starting line about twenty yards distant. The feathers
should all stick out of the ground to approximately the same
height, only the quill end being in the earth. The contesting
braves line up four feet apart behind the starting line and
on the word “Go!” each races to his feather, which should
be in line with him, and, without kneeling, plucks the
feather out of the ground, using only his teeth, and races
back to the starting line with it.

This race can be made harder and more exciting by plac-
ing three feathers, each two feet behind the other, which
the racing braves bring back to the starting line one at a
time. Should feathers be scarce, a chief can use the same
feathers a number of times by covering the tip of each
feather with a piece of clean paper, about four inches long
and one and a half inches wide, folded in two over the top
of each feather, which can be squared off at the top so that
the paper shield will remain in place more easily should
there be a breeze blowing.

 

 

NATURE KNOW -HOW ——This is a little trick-game which

teaches braves to observe, in addition to learning how trees,
plants, and flowers really look. It can be staged on an elab-
orate or very simple scale. In a comparatively small area,
prepared in advance, the chief fastens a number of birch
leaves carefully onto different willow trees, wild cherry
leaves on different alders, dandelion leaves on marigold
stems. He exchanges the flowers on different weeds or plants
and makes as many similar and scattered changes as the
flora of the area permits, without injuring rare or near-rare
plants of any kind. The various attachments should be
made carefully, green and brown threads being used to
camouflage the “grafts.” The band is then taken to the
faked nature terrain, the boundaries of which should be
marked with white cloth or paper streamers fastened to
branches or tree trunks. The braves should be given a
period of about twenty minutes, longer if the area is fairly
large, to discover as many substitutions as possible in the
time allowed. The brave spotting the nature switches should
snip off the tied-on leaves or flowers, leaving the thread
attached to the stem which he takes back to the chief. #

Research Briefs
Continued from Page 146

 

Assistance in production of the plan, as well as guidance
in the study, was received from representatives of more
than 160 organized recreation interest groups and eighty-
five agencies at all levels of government. Opinions were
solicited from recreation interests and participants as well
as opinions competitive with recreation. The plan, there-
fore, reflects a cross-section of public opinion throughout

the state. ( Part II will be reviewed at greater length in a
future issue.)

F ollow-Up

Everyone interested in research should become familiar
with the publication entitled Prospectus 0/ Research,**
summarizing research recommendations proposed by f0-
rums at the 1960 White House Conference on Children and
Youth. It contains many suggestions about how various
investigations might be pursued and how the resultant find-
ings could be most effectively disseminated and used.

The publication includes a consideration of every aspect
of the lives of children and youth, and includes one section
relating to recreation and leisure. A few of the specific
topics receiving special emphasis are: the need for public
and voluntary agencies to conduct research in the creative
and constructive use of leisure time; to determine the opti-
mum range of activity load that should be carried on by
preadolescents; to gather data on volunteer services by
youth; to study the effect of reading books, magazines,
comic books and newspapers; and to determine how the
participation in sports benefits the children, especially by
preadolescents in competitive sports.

RECREATION

FOR THE ILL
AND HANDICAPPED

 

HE RECREATION PROFESSION re-
T cently opened a new frontier by
joining forces with psychiatry and
medicine in an attempt to rehabilitate
heroin addicts. For more than a year,
a pilot study has been demonstrating
how recreation can aid in the manage-
ment of addicts during the drug-with-
drawal period in New York City’s Met-
ropolitan Hospital.

Records of addicts treated in New
York City hospitals showed they were
discharged without any follow-up care;
nearly all returned to the limbo of ad-
diction. The National Recreation As-
sociation Consulting Service on Rec-
reation for the 111 and Handicapped
wondered if the addition of follow-up
care coupled with recreation could im-
prove addicts’ chances of remaining off
drugs permanently. The New YOrk City
Department of Hospitals wanted to find
out, too. So, medical, psychiatric, and
recreation personnel became a research
team at the Narcotics Division of Met-
ropolitan Hospital in January, 1960.
Here are some of the team’s findings:

The recreation program for hospital-
ized addicts undergoing withdrawal is
made up of passive activities because
these patients are physically ill. Nausea,
joint pains, generalized weakness, and
possible convulsions limit ability to
take part in active recreation. There-
fore, the ward program is limited to
television, movies, arts, crafts, and
quiet games.

The “clean” addicts, the ones dis-
charged from the hospital after with-
drawal treatment, need highly special-
ized recreation therapy. For their use,
a “quarter-way house” came into being.
Similar to the halfway house used in
the treatment of psychiatric patients,
the quarter-way house, located in the
hospital, Serves as a therapeutic center
to help patients bridge the difficult pe-
riod between hospital discharge and the
full responsibilities of everyday life.

Quarter-way house is open five days
a week from 1 PM to midnight. There,
discharged patients can talk about their
problems with the psychiatrist, psychol-
ogist, and recreation workers. Patients

MRS. HILL, now executive director of
Comeback, Inc., was director of the N a-
tional Recreation Association Consult-
ing Service on Recreation for the Ill

and Handicapped, 1953 through 1960.

pital, New York City.

MARCH 1961

Beatrice Hill and Elliot Young

‘enjoy competitive activities during this
post-discharge period. Group debates,
boxing, and table tennis help them work
out frustrations and hostility. Recrea-

tion constructively fills the void left by
drug withdrawal.

(“It ROUP THERAPY among the patients
themselves is helpful, too. In the

permissive atmosphere of the quarter-
way house, the drug-free addicts venti-
late mutual problems: difficulties in
finding employment and regaining ac-
ceptance by their families.

During this painful time between
drug withdrawal and normal living,
competitive activities are not the only
means of social rehabilitation that help
the addict to remain free from drugs;
for example, with guidance and encour-
agement, these individuals can share in
normal social activities with their fam-
ilies. A dance planned by the recrea-
tion department was highly successful.
Many of the discharged patients at-
tended the event and brought their
families. A spirit of camaraderie was
obvious among the members of the
group; they danced, sang, and dined to-
gether throughout the evening.

An eight-hour boat trip and picnic
was just as successful. Thirty former
patients, some with their wives and
children, enjoyed this simple activity.
As one professional worker said, “This
group could not be singled out as differ-
ent from any of the other boat riders
and picnickers.”

It is too soon to prophesy that rec-
reation is one of the major factors in
the permanent recovery of addicts;
however, there is no doubt that active
group participation and professional
guidance can keep them drug-free for
longer periods. This, in itself, is prog-
ress, for it gives the psychiatrist and
psychologist more time to help addicts
discover why they return to their old
habit after withdrawal. However, it is
not too soon to predict that the com-
bined efforts of recreation, psychiatry,
and medicine will hasten the time when
we will have the answer to the key ques-
tion: Why do some people become ad-
dicts while others do not? #

Mental health in the average person
means that he possesses common
sense, that he is reasonably free of
. . that he is able to

pain and fear .
face trials with hope.—-JOSEPII L.

L ABELS FOR use out-of-doors—for

camps, parks, nature trails, and so
on—can be a vexation. Robert D. Star-
rett, supervisor of memorials for In-
diana State Parks discussed this prob-
lem at the 1958 Great Lakes Park Train-
ing Institute. Here are some of his sug-
gestions:

“Personally I find it difficult to think
of labels as text only; I also think of ap-
pearance. I know there are many fine,
machine-made labels of plastic and
aluminum or of glass, but I’d like to put
in a ‘plug’ for the common 3”-by-5"
card and the shipping tag about the
same size. We like a buff color in heavy
stock to withstand the weather.

“Text on either card or tag may be
printed (type-set) , lettered by hand, or
of the rubber-stamp variety. The fin-
ished 3” -by-5” card should be mounted
on a piece of wood slightly larger than
the card, then varnished with clear spar
varnish or coated with clear Krylon.
This will lengthen its life. Then the
piece of wood may be affixed to the tree
or object you wish to label. How you
mount it is your business. I know if I
say ‘Nail it,’ it will only start an argu-
ment. But mount it as you wish.

“The shipping tag is somewhat like
the 3” -by-5” card but requires no block
of wood. Its chances of survival are,
however, less than that of the 3”-by-5”
card tacked on a piece of wood.”

Another way to protect paper labels
was described by William Hopkins,
chief naturalist of the Huron-Clinton
Metropolitan Authority, Detroit, Mich-
igan. He found that cardboard or ship-
ping tag labels will last for two or three
years if dipped in a high-melting-point
paraflin to which a fungicide has been
added. Without fungicide, discolora-
tion may occur in a few weeks. The wax
used was Aristowax, 160° melting point,
manufactured by Union Oil Company.
The fungicide used was phenyl mercury
oleate (ten percent solution) added at
the rate of four liquid ounces to seven
pounds paraffin.

Some sources on labels and interpre-

tations are:

agement Series, American Institute of Park
Executives and Michigan State College.

igan State College, June 1954—.

operations. And each year these costs
continue to increase. Howdy, the Good

I Football and rodeos in the same sta-
dium? Bob Black, Midwest field rep-
resentative for the National Recreation
Association, writes that the new sta-
dium in Sterling, Colorado, has a beau-
tiful grassed field used by the high
school and junior college. It is also
used for Sterling’s nationally known
rodeo. To protect the grass during the
rodeo, the grass is mowed very short
and covered with sawdust to about one
inch. This is kept moist. Using a regu-
lar sweeper, the sawdust is swept off the
field after the rodeo and grass grows
better than ever.

dents in Rockville, Maryland, and Long ‘
Beach, California. Rockville’s formal
gardens have been revised by the high
school’s landscape planning class, and
new types of playground equipment,

lege industrial design classes, are now

used by the city. #

PERSONNEL

 

REPORT FROM ONTARIO

T RAINING FOR and on the job is the
biggest concern of Ontario’s So-
ciety of Directors of Municipal Recrea-
tion. Now established firmly, with a
membership of more than one hundred
Ontario recreation workers, the society
is devoting its energies to a study “in
dept ” of the training needs of present
and future practitioners in the province.

At its annual meeting and training
institute in November, the society con-
tinued its policy of self-training by con-
ducting a three-day course in “Tech-
niques of Business Management in
Recreation” for its members. The in-
stitute, most successful of four held by
the society to date, was headed by Jack
Dane, the society’s director of training.
Leaders in the business field presented
a variety of practical, useful talks on
such subjects as office design and lay-
out, filing, registration procedures, ac-
counting, meeting planning, etcetera.
One of the highlights was a paper pre-
pared by retiring President George
Kormos on “Liability Insurance.”

The Ontario society has split the

'function of its training committee three
ways: inservice training, undergradu-
ate training, and institutes. The first
committee will continue to work di-
rectly with the Ontario Department of
Education and the University of West-
ern Ontario on the inservice training
course which is the basic requirement
for qualification in the municipal field
in Ontario at present. In addition, it
will continue studies with the same au-
thorities to develop further inservice
courses as postgraduate training for
those who have completed the basic
work.

The undergraduate training commit-
tee is working with oflicials of universi-
ties in the province, particularly the
University of Western Ontario. on the
development of an undergraduate de-

gree course

in recreation. Such a

158

course was once offered by the univer-
sity, and early reports indicate there is
a good possibility of its reestablish-
ment. The institute’s committee will
continue to plan annual training semi-
nars for society members, with the rec-
ommendation that future institutes in-
clude a provision for prior home study
for those taking part.

The three committees all work under
the director of training, Jack Dane.
Mr. Dane has been responsible for the
society’s training program as presently
constituted and proected for the future.

The result of past emphasis on train-
ing was seen at the annual meeting,
when fourteen members, who had com-
pleted the inservice training course in

the past year and successfully stood for

examination by the board of regents,
were accepted as fellows of the society.
As a result, close to half the total mem-
bership of the society is now thus quali-

fied.

In the society’s elections, William
Jones, director of parks and recreation
in Sarnia, was named president, to suc-
ceed George Kormos of Sudbury.
Other officers are: Vice-President,
Richard Watts, Brantford; Secretaries,
Earl Davis, Burlington, and Laurie
Branch, Waterloo; Treasurer, J. J.
Keay, Scarborough Township; and Di-
rectors, Wendell Brewster, Oshawa, and
Ken Robinson, Peterboro.—J. THOR-
SEN, Director of Recreation, Cobourg,
Ontario.

Managing the Y.M.C.A. Camp, John

A. Ledlie, Editor. Association Press,
29] Broadway, New York 7. Pp. 320.
$4.95.

This book should be a basic text for
all concerned with camping, whatever
their agency, because of its sound in-
sights, clown-to-earth observations, and
practical suggestions. There is no at-
tempt to present ideas that each camp
must accept; rather, the book’s whole
philosophy is to modify or adjust wher-
ever indicated. Many sample forms are
included that are the result of practical
experience and may be used, with only
minor modification, by many camps.
The food-service section is one of the
most sensible I have ever read. It is
designed for the nonprofessional food-
service person and effectively presents
problems, procedures, and possible so-
lutions without superfluous adjectives.

The entire book is filled with valu-
able information and ideas for “camp-
ing-oriented” outdoor recreation pro-
fessionals. What is more, it’s good read-
ing—Stanley W. Stacker, Executive
Director, Metropolitan New York C oun-
cil, American Youth 'Hostels.

Fundamentals of Day Camping,
Grace Mitchell, illustrated by Sylvia
Feinburg. Association Press, 291
Broadway, New York 7. Pp. 232.
$4.50.*

Plans for this book were conceived
originally as a project of the Day Camp
Committee of the American Camping
Association. Such a project is very
time-consuming for leaders with jobs
of their own, and it soon became ap-
parent that one person could do a better
job of writing. Therefore, Mrs. Mit-
chell agreed to do it. It has not been
an easy project, has taken much longer
than planned, but the final result is
worth the wait.

One of the maj or difficulties was that
Mrs. Mitchell and most of the ACA day-
camp committee had worked primarily
in the field of private day camping, and
not with day camping as a function of
public recreation. Health and safety
standards and program-activity content
apply to both types, but their problems
of insurance, promotion, enrollment
procedures, budget, medical health re-
cords, and other phases of administra-
tion are very different. It is very much

to Mrs. Mitchell’s credit that her book,
160

while naturally leaning more toward
the private day camp, makes a real ef-
fort to include the public day camp as
well.

This book fills a big gap in the field

of camp literature. Operators and po-
tential operators of private day camps
will find it a basic, comprehensive book
of great value to them. Public recrea-
tion and park departments operating
day camps will find that although parts
of the book are not applicable to their
administrative setup, the general, basic

philosophy and many other parts are.

Clearly, the valuable material on lead-
ership selection and training, transpor-
tation, site selection and development,
health and safety, type of program con-
tent, and a host of other factors perti-.
nent to the child’s development, as well
as to the success of the day camp, make
this one of the most important books of
1961 for the recreation library. The il-
lustrations by Sylvia Feinburg add a
spice of humor and a touch of delight-
ful informality.—V.M.

Stepping Stones to Nature, Robert
O. Bale. Burgess Publishing Company,
426 South 6th Street, Minneapolis 15.
Pp. 14], illustrated. $2.50.*

This soft-cover, spiralbound book is
full of simple, practical, and sometimes
unusual craft projects made from natu-
ral materials, suitable for nature pro-
grams in camp, playgrounds, or wher-
ever children are found. Do you know
how to make a snowstorm in a glass
jar? Bayberry candles? “Angel Feath-
ers”? Mullein rosettes? A pine-needle

brush? A cornhusk brush? A cow’s-
horn bugle?

Dozens of projects involving natural
materials such as leaves, twigs, bark,
flowers, bone, clay,'seeds, as well as
projects for studying weather, the plan-
ets, animals and plants, will be a real

boon to camp counselors, playground
leaders, teachers, and parents.

administrators. The suggestions in this

booklet, which was prepared by the
ACA Conservation Camping Project
chaired by Reynold Carlson of Indiana
University, will go far in providing a
working basis for developing effective
land-management practices. Its realis-
tic coverage, while designed for camp
administrators, will also be a valuable
addition to the staff library. Much of
the content is equally valid for park-
land management programs. The sug-
gestion that submarginal lands be ob-
tained now and prepared through con-
servation measures for future use is an
example of the advanced thinking of the
project committee. The multitude of
simple, low-cost, workable projects that
can be easily utilized by experienced
camp personnel make this a valuable

book. (See also Page 138.)

The Tale of a Pond, written and il-
lustrated by Henry B. Kane. Alfred A.
Knopf, 50l Madison Avenue, New
York 22. Pp. 120. $3.00.

The weird and the exotic are not
always in far-off corners of the world.
Take the strange doings in any pond.
There are “clams who hitchhike on
fish; animals that turn inside out,
flowers that hunt for their mates; and
insects who carry their air supply un-
derwater with them.” The full year’s
cycle in the life of a pond is described
in lyric prose and dramatized by strik-
ing photographs and illustrations. Mr.
Kane’s beautiful book invites you to
wade right in.

Early Sports and Pastimes in New
Jersey, Harry B. and Grace M. Weiss.
The Past Times Press, 492 Riverside
Avenue, Trenton, New Jersey. Pp. 148.

$5.00.
This book, its boards and binding of

decorated paper, covers the leisure ac-
tivities of the people of New Jersey
from its earliest days to around 1860.
Naturally, it flows into Pennsylvania
and New York, since New Jersey from
its earliest days was greatly influence(\
by Philadelphia and New York City. I

Recreation in those days tended to be ‘
lusty and robust. Barn-raising, bees,
fairs, bear and bull baiting, cock fight-
ing, billiard and dice palaces, and horse
races vied with exhibitions of freaks,
wild animals, fireworks, minstrels,
steamboat trips, dancing, and the thea-‘c

RECREATION

ter. New Jersey cities that today are
great industrial centers, like Wee-
hawken and Hoboken, were famous as
watering places, picnic sites, and public
gardens, visited by boat, stagecoach,
ferry, and horseback.

Life was full of work and hardship.
Travel by foot, canoe, dugout ferry, or
horseback was for business only. As
roads improved, however, stage wagons
and stagecoaches made traveling more
comfortable. As railroads and steam-
boats came into use, so did the various

types Of amusements that depend upon
travel facilitiesu—the circus, the min-
strel, the wild animal and float displays,
and many others.

Life in New Jersey in the early days
up to the Civil War probably was not
very different from life in the other col-
onies and states, except that its location
exposed it to more different opportuni-
ties and a more accelerated program of
amusement than in other states without
two large cities to draw upon. As a
contribution to Americana, as well as to
the background of recreation, books
like this deserve praise and attention.

Creative Metalworking, E. B. Matt-
son. Bruce Publishing Company, 400
North Broadway, Milwaukee 1, Wis-
consin. Pp. 121, illustrated. $3.25.

This beautifully printed and illus-
trated book is by an industrial arts in-
structor in Redwood City, California.
In his preface, the author says, “Give
a man a spark of an idea, a challenge,
and he will surprise everyone with his
craftsmanship. If young people are
given a real challenge to meet in their
early education, they will be adequately
trained to meet the greater problems
they will face in the future.”

In his thirty-six projects, to be made
of aluminum, brass or steel, Mr. Matt-
son has given clear write-ups, mechani-
cal drawings, and photographs of fin-
ished projects. The projects are well
chosen for modern design, usefulness,
beauty, and good taste. The appendix
gives a valuable listing of tools and
equipment needed for a class Of twenty-
five in metalwork.

Crowder and William J. Reynolds,
Editors. Broadman Press, 127 Ninth

Avenue North, Nashville 3, Tennessee.
Pp. 96, illustrated. $2.95.

Songs about God and Church, the
family, nature, friends, and play ac-
tivities make up' this attractively illus-
trated collection. A few songs are of
folk origin; most, however, are com-
posed. The music and words are dig-
nified and meaningful; the more than
eighty songs will be enjoyable to learn
and sing.

of how to live in the out-of—doors. The
search still goes on and the answers are
not all clear, but increasingly these
leaders are discovering that the out-of-
doors Oiiers tremendous opportunity for
the church to provide an atmosphere Of
Christian community in which signifi-
cant learning can take place supple-
menting and complimenting that which
goes on in the home and: ch1irch of the
community the rest of the year. An-
other trend is the employment Of pro-
fessionally trained people now to com-
bine Christian education and summer
camp program leadership and responsi-
bility.

Church camping in the Midwest has
been and continues to be influenced by
the Northland Recreation Leader’s Lab-
oratory held at Camp Ihduhapi near
Minneapolis each April for the past
twenty-eight years. Here, church and
agency leaders learn the philosophy and
skills of recreation in relation to their
program. As a result, the recreation
needs of camp groups are being served
through the use of folk songs, folk
games, games of skill from many lands
and peoples, and crafts using basic ma-
terials. Northland, counting itself a
worthy successor of the Waldenwoods,
