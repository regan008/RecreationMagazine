(DI the Cover

“And the whole world sent back the song which
now thc angels sing”: A Very Merry Christmas to
All. We received such a widespread response to our
cover of last Deccnther that we asked Racnm'rtox
Magazine artist Don Smith to capture some of the
same happy spirit for us this year.

Next Blot-1h

Are you ready for the challenge of the Sixties? Our
January issue will carry statements from leaders in
labor, business, industry, and the three major faiths,
voicing what they expect from the recreation pro-
Iession in the next decade. There will be a discus-
sion of the curriculum strategy necessary to produce
the kind of leaders that recreation, in all its many
aspects and phases, needs. The story of Ilouston,
Texas—past, present, and future—will epitomize the
phenomenal growth of municipal recreation, not
only in the Southwest. hut across the nation. Dr.
Howard Conant has prepared an article on creative
art teaching in recreation and takes a stand with

which you may agree or disagree wholeheartedly
and fervently.

JANE
ADDAMS

September 6, 1860
to
May 21, 1935

Virginia Musselman

DECEMBER 1959

If any of our readers use the suggestions for a

program, as mentioned here, be sure to let us know.
Further program ideas can be obtained from

the Jane Addams Centennial—1960 Headquarters,
2006 Walnut Street, Philadelphia 3, Pennsylvania, or

from National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood
Centers, 226 West 4 7th Street, New York 36.

T HE YEAR OF 1960 will be the centennial of the birth of Jane Addams,

founder of Hull House in Chicago, champion of the poor, pioneer
in the health, welfarc, and social work field, instigator of child-
labor legislation, a founder of the Women’s International League for Pcace and
Freedom, and one of the three women to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Agencies and organizations of labor, social work, and child welfare will
combine forces to pay tribute, on local and national levels, to the contribution
that Jane Addams gave so freely and gladly in social betterment, equality of
races, justice in government and peace. Jane Addams was not concerned,
however, only with peace and bread. She had a constant awareness of beauty,
a devout belief in the importance of play, and her fame on the political scene
sometimes obscures her efforts to make art, culture, and all other forms of rec-
reation available to everyone.

The recreation movement owes her a great deal. She was one of the
original founders of the National Recreation Association and served as a vice-
president of its first executive board. At its first national Congress in Chicago
in 1907, she was on the program, and her speech was on “Recreation and So-
cial Morality.” She opened the first “independent” playground in Chicago,
in a vacant lot adjoining Hull House, equipping it with swings, seesaws, giant
slides, and sand bins.

Hull House Opened its doors in September, 1889. Less than two weeks
later “reading parties” for factory girls were started. That first Christmas,
at the children’s Christmas party, litt'e girls turned away and would not ac-
ccpt candy. Noticing this, she found that these children were working four-
teen hours a day in a candy faetory. A children’s party thus sparked her long
fight for child-labor laws. That first New Year, Ilull House gave an “old set-
tlers' ” party for old peeple, one of the first, if not the first golden-age club.

The V'Cry first building erectcd at Hull House contained an art gallery,
well-lighted for day and night use. Art, music, dance, and drama groups for
children and adults were among the first activities in her priority of import-
ance. She understood from the beginning that education, recreation, and so-
cial work were all interrelated, that they were interdependent.

In 1960, public recreation departments may be asked by social agencies
to join in community celebrations honoring Jane Addams. They should not
wait to be asked, however, but should make plans for their own celebrations.
Festivals, pageants, play days, music and dance programs, plays, discussion
groups, art exhibits, hobby shows are only a few of the special events suit-
able to present “in honor of Jane Addams." Plan ahead.

And what more fitting memorial could be devised than the dedication
of a new playground, a new park, rose garden, children's theater, music shell,
or other recreation area or faci'ity to Jane Addams, who knew that “progress
is not automatic; the world grows better because people wish that it should
and take the right steps to make it better”? #

How to Use Snow Fences
Sirs:

We, in Red Bank, would commend
you for the excellent article carried in
the November 1959 issue, “Art Comes
to Main Street.” The story was com-
plete in detail, and we hope it will assist
other communities in planning such an
event.

However, for the benefit of all read-
ers interested in such an affair, we must
point out a slight error in the article
concerning the use of snow fencing.
Rather than say, “Do not use snow fenc-
ing,” we say, “It is excellent for the
purpose when properly erected.” It can
be attached (by wire) to parking me-
ters. lamp posts, signs, and even frames
built for the purpose, as shown in the
pictures accompanying the article. (In
this case the frames were nailed to the
street with four-inch spikes.) Snow
fencing, when properly strengthened at
correct intervals (ten to fifteen feet) is
entirely suitable for hanging even the
larger paintings. It is also very versatile
and can be erected in many shapes and
forms to provide an interesting Parisian
display.

We are currently planning next year’s
Festival of Art and our plans include the
same use of snow fencing as before.

Useful Pertinent Facts
Sirs:

I am program chairman for our local
Rotary Club and at the last meeting had
the honor of introducing our recreation

and received many pertinent facts I
could use in the introduction of the pro-

Sirs:

. . . I did want to tell you how much
l enjoyed both the guest editorial by
C. Frank Brockman and the article by
Karla V. Parker, which appeared in the
October issue of RECREATION.

I think whoever thought of the idea
of relating articles to the Congress de-
serves an extra bit of praise for creative
thinking. Also, your printer should he
complimented for the excellent printing
job he does on your magazine, especial-

' ly the obvious care he takes with your

many types of illustrations.

) THE SIXTH WHITE HOUSE CONFER-
ENCE ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH will con-
vene next March. President Eisenhower
issued the call for it nearly two years
ago and set in motion a vast machinery,
representative of a'l components of our
society. On the thresho‘d of a new dec-
ade, the seven thousand participants
will consider the problems of youth
brought about by the vast social changes
of the past ten years. Through the out-
standing leadership of Mrs. Rollin
Brown, chairman of the conference, rec-
reation will be one of the most impor-
tant matters considered in the planning
necessary to meet the challenge of these
changes.

The National Recreation Association,
at the request of the conference director,
is reviewing all reports submitted to the
conference by states and by organiza-
tions concerned, and is preparing mate-
rials on recreation to be presented at the
meeting and/or to be published there-
after by the conference. A fourteen-
page report has already been submitted.
NRA’S executive director, Joseph Pren-
dergast has been invited to prepare a
study paper for the workshOps on “The
Use of Leisure Time by Children and
Youth,” and the Association has been
asked to nominate four persons to rep-
resent it at the conference. The Asso-
ciation was also asked to recommend
NRA service associates for invitation to
the conference.

activity in schools to encourage and
guide gifted and apt students not only
in science and engineerine. but in cul-
tural subjects too. The high-IQ student
is gifted in these as well, and there is
a need for artists, designers, craftsmen
in the graphic arts as well. \Vhat. then,
is the responsibility of recreation lcad-
ers in this picture?

Much can be done to stimulate par-
ticipation in art groups—clay model-
ing, sculpturinrr, painting. and so on,
and in the many crafts sponsored by a
recreation department. Creative activi-
ties of all sorts can he introduced and
encouraged. Help your young people to
discover new and exciting interests.

Call upon local printers, tcachers,
commercial artists to do volunteer work
with your groups—on poster work, dis-
plays, layout and design, lettering and
type. creative photography, and so
forth. Initiate a campaign to arouse in-
terest first. before your new groups are
launchcd; then givc your youngsters

some fascinating projects—and you'll
never have to worry about the turnout.

RECREATION
IN
OUR
CHANGING
TIMES

John J. Collier

Pointing up today’s inter-
relationship of recreation
and parks . . .

ODAY’S DEFINITION of recreation is quite a contrast
Tto that of fifty years ago—the concept that play was

for children and parks were for passive use. The way
people define reereation today brings to mind the old Aes0p
fable of the elephant and the three blind men who were de-
termining what the animal was like by touch. The first
blind man felt the trunk and said, “The elephant is like a
snake.” The second felt the leg and said, “The elephant
is like,a tree." The third felt the animal's side and said,
“The elephant is like a wall.”

If each one of you were asked what the word recreation
means. there would he many different answers. It is mis-
interprcted frequently and often associated with having
to be organized. It doesn’t mean the latter any more than
it means partieipating in a ball game. painting a picture,
playing a musical instrument, hiking, picnicking, camping,
fishing, visiting a museum, or just standing and looking
at a beautiful vista. Recreation is a collective, generic term.
denoting all the things man might do in his leisure to pro-
vide him with.rclaxation. enjoyment. and release from ten-
sions. The National Park Serviee, in a 1933 report for the
Natural Resources Board, stated: “Reereation eonnotes all
that is reereative of the individual, the community or thc
nation. In this sense it is broader than the ‘physical activity’
concept. It includes mental and spiritual expression. It al-
lows gratification of the nearly infinite variety of tastes
and predilections. . . . The public. recreation movement in
America represents a conseious cultnral ideal of the Ameri-
can people, just as the great system of public education
represents such an ideal. Its SUpreme objective is the pro-
motion of the general welfare, through the creation of op-
portunities for a more ahundant and happicr life for every-

99
one.

Joseph l’rendergast, exccntive director of the National
lleereation Association, said reeently, “Reereation is what
you do when nobody (and no subtle social pressure) tells
you what you must do. One man’s rccreation may be ten-
nis. Another man may prefer to meditate under a tree. The
National lieereation Association thinks both men are right
and we try to make sure that eaeh will find what he wants
close at hand.”

The use of the word in this broad sense is absolutely es-
sential to our thinking and planning if we are to meet the
ehallenge that the new leisure imposes upon the park and
recreation executives in these changing times. Only on this
broad basis ean we hope to move forward together.

W e have seen park use waver between two extremes. We

have had the philosophy of passive use only, exemplified by
"kcep-ofT-the-grass" signs. We have had the opposite, per-
sonified by a man with a whistle around his neck, insisting
a park should be for active use only. with ball fields and
tennis courts. He also insisted that in order for people to
have recreation they must be organized and must perspire.

In the early days of this century there were verbal fights
and, in some meetings and committees. people almost came
to blows, over the use of, and changes in, existing facilities
and development and use of new ones. Everyone of us owes
a real debt to those early pioneer park men who fought to
maintain the beauty aspect of a park and won, not as much
as they would have liked, but far more than is sometimes
realized. Some twenty years ago a well-known recreation
site planner did the site plans for a city in Michigan. One
of these sites remained undeveloped, thank God. Four years
ago I reviewed that old plan. examined the site, and found
a thirty-acre. level site. with 336 beautiful oak and maple
trees. The old plan would have called for a complete bull-
dozer job on every tree—a flat bare thirty acres—before
the recommended plan could have been realized.

Needless to say. the National Recreation Association.
before it would develop a plan and make recommendations.
requested the city to provide a tree-location rendering for
the entire area. The final plan incorporated most of the
park and recreation facilities required in such an area. The
final devel0pment was accomplished by removing only
thirty-three of the. original trees. What bare and desolate
places playgrounds and playfields would be today if the
early “organized recreation" proponents had had their way!

We have a heritage from those early park men. Those
whose primary concern is for parks and those whose prin-
ciple concern is organized recreation have. in the main.
adhered to one basic philosophy concerning park and ree-
rcation facility development. maintenance. and use. The
underlying three principles are beanty. function, and case
of maintenance. Of these, the first two are the most im-
portant, but with budgets what they are. the third must be
an important consideration, too. Today’s accepted philoso-
phy is, in essence. the same as expressed in English laws in
1888. They defined a park as follows: “A public park is
any park, garden. or other land dedicated to the recreation
of people." The Olmsted brothers, in 190-1, added that “the
recreation therein is expected to come in part, at least, from
the beauty of appearance.” We have since appended, “any
area of land or water set aside for outdoor recreation pur-
poses, whether it be recreation of a passive or active natnrc.
or any degrees between those two extremes."

The 'definition is the same today. The difl'ercnee has
come in the interpretation of the word recreation. This
definition has been developing and broadening through the
years, and our facilities today reflect its deepening evolntion.

DECEMBER 1959

'l'ypes of Recreation la‘adersl-Iip Needed

There was a time when the park superintendent and his
employees almost lived the lives of rccluscs, operating, main-
taining. and protecting the park area, a quiet life in the
out-of-doors, surrounded by woods and waters. Unfortu-
natcly, some people still think this is their current role.
This misconception nceds correcting by an aggressive in-
terpretation program acqnaiuting people with the many
recreation: opportunities in the facilities under the eontrol
of park staff. A few people, calling themselves professional
recreation leaders. still have dilliculty in realizing the ex-
tent of the park man's stake in recreation. A few still think
that all recreation must be organized.

Today’s professional park and recreation: leaders. in the
provision of recreation facilities and in dealing with peo-
ple's leisure-time interests. are dedicated to providing di-
versified recreation opportunities for all ages. They be-
lieve a publicly supported parks and recreation service
should endeavor to provide the greatest possible variety of
recreation opportunities for all ages.

In order to provide these. three types of leadership are

necessary—direct leadership. enabling leadership. and in-
direct leadership.
0 Direct recreation leadership is the type with which we
are most familiar. This type works directly with people
in an organized settin". The leader must be sensitive to
the initial interests of the group with which he is working
and must use good recreation methods to enhance the qual-
ity and carry-over valne of the program. He must be well-
versed in the basic sociological and psychological needs,
interests, and habits of people in their leisure time.

The range of programs, carried on by direct leadership,

includes playgrounds. tecn centers, senior-citizen groups,
choral groups, plays, sports. social activities, camping, na-
lure activities, clubs, and so on. The primary requirement
for the leader handling these jobs is ability to instruct in
a specified skill area, such as in arts and crafts. music,
drama, golf, swimming, nature. and so forth.
0 Enabling recreation leadership is that leadership pro-
vided to assist individuals and groups in finding and using
the facilities or resources of the park and recreation dc-
partmcnt. In a broad sense, this is a consultant type of
leadership, dcsigned to assist aml suggest to recreation
seekers ways they may use the facilities or services of the
department to their best advantage. For example. that serv-
ice provided by orienting day- or overnight-camping lead-
crs to the area to be used—the trails and facilities. the rules
and regulations involved. These services are often provided
by ranger or park supervisor. Another cxample is provid-
ing picnic kits to groups. with counseling on their use.

In the years ahead. we will need, more and more. to pro-

415

vide leadership designed to help people help themselves.
There is a limit to the number of direct leaders we will be
ahle to afford. We will need to provide more specific train-
ing for our people having this kind of leadership and re-
sponsibility. It is much more than custodial in nature.

0 Indirect recreation leadership is one of the most effec-
tive and also one of the most difficult to provide. It is the
self-guiding kind, coming about through the design of our
parks and other recreation facilities, the way we deter-
mine traffic flow and use of facilities, trails or walks, roads,
parking huilding, room arrangements, location of rest
rooms, landscaping, location of picnic areas, the layout

generally. All these provide silent leadership. Other ex-
amples are trailside museums and self-guided nature trails.

Our common goal is that all people of all ages shall have
the maximum opportunity to use their steadily increasing
We
must recognize that prohably more recreation is going on
outside our jurisdiction than in it. We must he aware of
the many forces at work in our field and draw them into
our planning and provide unified leadership to these di-
verse aspects. If we don’t, we will be caught like the man
who was trying to delay the departure of the train by hold-

leisure time in a constructive and creative manner.

Recreation Bonds

The Wyoming State Supreme Court,
on February 9. 1959. reversed a dis-
trict court decision that issuance of
recreation bonds approved by county
voters in August, 1956, was unconsti-
tutional. The objection to the issuance
of $250,000 in bonds by Albany County
had been contested by a taXpayers’
group on the grounds that “providing
recreational facilities is a municipal
function only. that such a plan should

and that setting up a committee to
administer the finances amounted to
investing county money in a private

lation of the constitution.

The court held that the law “ex-
pressly and in plain unambiguous lan-
guage authorized the county commis-
sioners to levy taxes, issue bonds, or
incur indebtedness for the purpose
stated. The bond funds were pegged
for a swimming pool, community cen-

ter, skating rink, golf course, and ski-
ing development.

Pending final decision on the case,
steps had been taken to provide some
of the facilities authorized in the bond
issue. For example, the Laramie Co'm-
munity Golf Association has been de-
veloping a grass-greens course it had
planned to turn over to the city when
completed. Likewise, swimming pool
projects have been initiated hy private
groups. -— .arumie Daily Boomerang.

No Immunity

A decision by the Michigan Supreme
Court exemplified how easily municipal
tort immunity can be jeopardized by
excursions into private enterprise that
seem insignificant at the time. Acme
Township, a small community, made a
practice of renting its town hall for pri-
vate parties at a fee of $3.00 per night.
During one of these parties a woman
tripped over the rear steps of the hall
and brought action which resulted in
a judgment of $4.250 against the town-
ship. The court ruled that use of the
hall for the party had no connection
with the exercise of any governmental
function. In this instance the township
gambled at odds of 33.00 to $4,250 and
lost. It was pointed out that if such ac-
tivities are to be engaged in, the charge
should be sufficient to insure mainten-
anee and provide adequate liability in-
surance coverage. -—-Michigan M unfai-

pal Review, February 1959.

N0 Trespassing

In December 1958 the Minnesota

Supreme Court handed down an opin-
ion supporting a previous decision
holding that there was no authority
wherehy “a municipality, or any agency
board of a municipality, may itself en-
gage in a private business on municipal
property, even though such property
has been acquired by dcvise or gift.”
The court thereby sustained an action
brought by the owner of a motion pic-
ture theater to enjoin the city perman-
ently from permitting its auditorium
board to operate a motion picture busi-
ness in a huilding that had been a gift
to the city. Apparently income from
the showing of motion pictures had pro-
vided the funds to support the operation
of the auditorium. —Mimzesota Ma-
nicipah'tfes. January 1959.

Use of City Coliseum

Held refusal by city council to rent
coliseum to amateur hockey team for
certain dates after so renting to another
team was not abuse of discretion. (State
v. City of Spokane, 330 P 20’ 718,
Wash, Oct. 15, I958.)*

provements bonds to finance marina,

CHRISTMAS
DISPLAYS

With Store «Window Finesse

ll"illiam Penn Molt, Jr.

llltlSTMAS DISPLAYS have been
moving outdoors in recent years.
In fact. we find them so attractive
in Oakland. California, that Easter and
other seasons have been increasingly
emphasized with of fresco exhibits. The
main problem has always been to make
lifelike yet durable figures—inexpen-
sively. Some of our finest attempts have
possessed about as much resistance to
weather as a snowman in a Turkish
bath.

Oakland Park Department craftsmen
have evolved a technique of construct-
ing figures from burlap and polyester
resin that fills the bill more than ade-
quately. Displays built with this simple
method have the heauty and finesse that
one expects to find in the downtown
store window yet are practically im-
pervious to the elements.

The Nativity scene in lCastshore Park
during the 1958 Yuletide mason offered
an excellent example. Sixteen special-
ly fabricated figures grouped in and
around the manger included the three
members of the Holy Family. three
kings, three camels, six shepherds. and
the latest—a large gray donkey.

Built to a slightly larger-than-lifc
scale. these colorful figures became the
background for a flock of real sheep.
And just a few days before Christmas
a half-dozen live woolly lambs drew
their first breath and made their first
still-legged leaps in the midst of this
“Palestinian” setting.

tendent of parks in Oakland. California.

Simplicity adds beauty . . .

Fabrication of figures is done in the
park department shops, where local
seulptors and artists often join our dis-
play designer. Cordon Mortenson. and
his crew in the creative process. Res-
taurateur Fenner Fuller, a noted ee-
raniic sculptor, for example. originated
the idea of the Nativity scene and has
given many hours to the molding and
firing of clay hands and faces.

Here is the method of making the
figures:

Start by building a simple armature
or frame of wood. Pieces of 2" by 2"
by ml" are most satisfactory (Fig. 1).
To give needed dimension in areas
where it is required (across shoulders.
body. etceteral chicken wire can be
nailed and formed to the frame.

When this basic framework is ready,
the burlap may be cut and, still dry,
fitted to the frame (Fig. 2). Then the
burlap is saturated with polyester resin,
one piece at a time. and applied to the
frame lliig. 3i. The burlap will fall
into the natural folds of the cloth and
ha rdcn. If some unnatural folds are de-
sired. the burlap can be pulled into posi-
tion before hardening and held by wire.

strin" or propping with sticks. These

be
aids can be removed once the resin has
set lapproximately thirty minutes).
When the resin has set and cured for
a period of four hours, it is good to coat
the entire figure with resin again. This
makes the burlap more dense and re-
sults in a better painting surface. Any
paint or paint method may be used in
finishing the figure. Spraying with an

oil-base paint. however, seems to be the

quickest and most satisfactory.

Faces and hands of the human figures
may be made in several different ways.
In addition to molding in clay and fir-
ing. they may be carved from wood or
modeled in clay and east in resin and
fiberglass.

Use of these techniques. modified to
fit your own needs. can give. you figures
of lasting beauty at comparatively low
cost. We have found in most eases that
the original set quite naturally grows
into something more complete aml sat-
isfying with the passage of the years. 33:
Note: If readers are interested, the
Oakland Park Deportment has a mim-
eographed sheet of instructions show-
ing how to construct the burlap ond
resin figures, which they will be glad
to provide upon request.

41 NATIONAL RECREATIO}

“The conditions of the modern industrial era
set the stage for the recreation performance”

——H0mer C. \Vadsworth.

IIE SPIRITED, week-long 1959 National Recreation Con-
T gress was formally opened at the Morrison Hotel in

Chicago, on Monday mornintr, September 28, at nine
o’clock, with an official salute to the unusually large com-
mercial exhibit section, as well as the educational exhibits.
An impressive opening session followed at eleven, when
Joseph Prendcrgast, chairman of the Congress Policy Com-

mittee, welcomed delegates and introduced distinguished

guests. governors’ representatives, visitors from other lands
and our two new states, Alaska and Hawaii, and members of
the Local Arrangements Committee. Our loyal and dear
friend, Ethel T. Mori, superintendent of recreation, Hono-
lulu, was on hand to present leis to Mr. I’rendergast: Charles
B. Cranford, outgoing president of the ABS: Congress sec-
retary Willard B. Stone; Mrs. Rollin Brown, member of the
Board of the National Recreation Association and chairman
of the 1960 White House Conference on Children and
Youth; and keynote speaker Arthur S. Flemming, U. S. Sec-
retary of Health, Education and Welfare. Mr. Flemming
paid a fine tribute to M rs. Brown’s work on the White House
Conference, and spoke of the federal stake in recreation
and possible division of responsibilities for recreation
among the national, state, and local levels of government
and private agencies. (For [all text of his speech, see the
,'\"ovember issue of RECREATION. Page 370.]

The entire opening ceremony, starting with organ music
by Helen Brawley of Chicago and the effective singing of
the Peoples Gas, Light, and Coke Company Chorus, with
George Haase conducting. proved to be very moving. A
posting of the colors, by the company’s American Legion
post color guard, and the invocation, given by Dr. Bernard
D. I’erlow, rabbi of the Chicago Loop Synagogue, preceded
the opening address. This and all later sessions were planned
in the light of the overall Congress theme: “Recreation in
an Expanding Leisure.”

Other sessions dealt with a wide variety of subjects,
among them recreation leadership techniques and concerns,
recreation for teen-agers and its relation to juvenile delin-
quency. recreation for families, the elderly, handicapped.
hospitalized, and armed services, among many other groups.
There were demonstrations of arts and crafts, exercises for
physical fitness, ways of conducting successful music pro-
grams, to name a few. Actually, this year’s discussion topics
could be grouped in the following general categories (in

relation to recreation. of course): administration and or-

4-18

ganization; areas, facilities, and equipment; armed forces;
athletics and physical fitness; church recreation; commu-
nity recreation; ill, handicapped, and aged; industrial; in-
ternational; personnel; professional education; program-
ing; public relations and publicity; research; rural recre-
ation; youth.

The principal speakers at general sessions and the ban-
quet, on the other hand, discussed the following tepics: “Rec-
reation for a Strong America,” Mr. Flemming; “Purposes
and Priorities,” Dr. David D. Henry, president of the Uni-
versity of Illinois; “The Role of Recreation in an AfIIuent
Society,” Homer C. Wadsworth, chairman, President’s Citi-
zens Advisory, Committee on Fitness of American Youth;
“Leisure and the American Dream,” Dr. Paul Goodman,
psychologist and author of The Empire City, among other
books: and “Is Recreation Doing Its Job?” This last was
a symposium at the closing session and was handled by three
speakers dealing with the subject from three different views:
The Standpoint of a Parent, Mrs. Fred L. Keeler, vice-presi-
dent, National Congress of Parents and Teachers; an Edu-
cator, Francis B. McKeag, assistant to the general superin-
tendent of schools, Chicago; a Taxpayer, George A. Ranney,
Jr., president, Welfare Council of Metropolitan Chicago.
The addresses of all general session people will appear in the
1959 Congress Proceedings. Order your cepy early.

T HE NATURE AND FUNCTION of the recreation per-
formance are determined not by the amount
of time to be filled up by ceaseless activity but by the
need of the consumer, from both an individual and
social point of view. If we assume with Ortega and
others that a sense of insecurity is a by-product of
modern modes of living, then it becomes clearly a
function of the recreation movement to help pe0ple
to recover that sense of personal worth and dignity
that is the hallmark of the free man everywhere.

It becomes also our purpose to broaden and extend

the range of his interest and of his taste that he may
find joy and happiness in the choice he makes for the

use of his Spare time. . . . The educator seeks to im-
part the knowledge and skill necessary to a useful life,
both as a citizen and as a producer. The recreationist
seeks to impart knowledge and skill in the arts of lei—
sure. Together they are tasks directed toward creating
a way of life for men that will produce enduring per-
sonal satisfaction and an active sense of community.—
HOMER C. WADSWORTH, chairman, President's Ad-
visory Committee on the Fitness of American Youth.

kee department of municipal recreation and adult education.
Charles B. Cranford, outgoing ARS president and Philadel-
phia deputy commissioner of recreation, was given a special
citation.

A National Recreation Association National Advisory
Council dinner was given by Mr. Prcndcrgast, NRA execu-
tive director, on Sunday at which Thomas W. Lantz, Ta-
coma, W'ashington, superintendent of public recreation, was
appointed new chairman of the Council, succeeding Robert
W. Crawford. A special meeting of NRA associates and rep-
resentatives of affiliates, to discuss such national matters as
the forthcoming White House Conferences on Children and
Youth, and the Aging, the Outdoor Recreation Resources
Review Commission, and the National Cultural Center was
held on Sunday evening.

Exhibits

The connnercial exhibit area was larger and more impres-
sive this year than ever before, and the exhihits were lively
and crowded. Among the many really fine displays was a
five-by-five-foot scale model of the modern American play-
ground included in this summer’s American National Ex-
hibit in Moscow. Shown for the first time this year, too,
was a full-size example of a “street zoo” cage. Designed
to bring temporary displays of live animals to districts that
do not have easy access to a zoo, these can also be used for
outdoor displays of arts and crafts, nature exhibits, and
others. The lighted cage lifts off the base and a transparent
bubble dome replaces it.

Sports fans found many exhihits of sports equipment;
music lovers, dancers, and so on listened to the latest in

stereophonie reeords. Exotic games from :uany parts of the
world vicd witl: aluminum diving boards. encyclopedias,
sealed-bean: lighting. Exhibitors were ever ready to demon-
strate any or all of this equipment, which indicated the wide
range of today's recreation activities.

Exhibitors not only contributed :nncl: to the Congress
in the way of color and :uerchandisc display but actively
participated in events of the week. Their acting as hosts
at the “Get Acquainted Party" on the first evening is becom-
ing a tradition. The turnout this year crowded the ballroom
to the point where dancing had to be a matter of well-planned
strategy—for a time at least. This year, too, expert instruc-
tors from the manufacturers of arts and crafts supplies of-
fcred delegates expert help with the learning of new skills
at the all-day arts-and-crafts workshop.

Consultation and Book Center

This area, humming with activity, consisted of the Na-
tional Recreation Association Rook Center, with its fasci-
nating collection of hooks on all recreation subjects; the
National Recreation Association Personnel Service and pep-
ular Job Mart; the RECREATION Magazine exhibit; the NRA
Consultation Service and Insurance Information, and the
American Recreation Society display.

Reerealionists “Recreate”

Who says business does not :uix with pleasure? The
planned program of socializing for Congress delegates illus-
trated leadership techniques and liver recreation interests
from first to last. The Local Arrangements Committee,
chaired by Vern Hernlund and Terry Rose of the Chicago
Park District, spread out an array of entertainment for all.

First, the Chicago Wives Committee helped delegates’
wives to select their own activities from a smorgasbord of
suggestions. At a kaer klatscl: on Monday, they made their
individual choices. Among them “Don McNeill’s Breakfast
Club,” mcntioued above, proved to be very popular, and
shopping trips were, of course, on the agenda.

Publicity

Even though the Congress hit Chicago at the same time
the White Sox won the pennant, press, radio, and television
went all out to tell the Congress story. Not only did the
Chicago papers devote a great deal of coverage to it, but the
Associated Press and United Press International put a lot
of Congress material on the wires. Clippings are still rolling
in from all parts of the country.

There was quite a bit of radio and television, too. Mr.
I’rendergast appeared on “At Random.” a popular Chicago
television: program. This late-evening show runs for three-
and-a-quarter hours and is moderated by syndicated col-
umnist Irv Kupeinet. Other members of that evening’s
conversation panel were Dr. Preston Rradlcy, pastor of Chi-
cago’s Peoples9 Churel: and founder of the Izaak Walton
league; Rill Veeck, Chicago White Sox president; Warren
Brown, sports columnist; actress Carroll Baker. who received
so much acclaim when she played Baby Doll; Tony Owcn,
producer of thc “Donna Reed" television show; and come-
dian Joey Adams. No topic was assigned to the group—it

:ncnt over to the Morrison for an interview with Mr. I‘rcn-

viewed on WMAQ radio. Mr. Waller told listeners to
W RBM’s “Town Crier" about recreation: in atomic subma-

carried a statement by Elliott from coast to coast. Also
scheduled for the Jack Eigen show were Jerry l’elton and
NRA’s district representatives Charles Odcgaard and James

word in, cdge- or otherwise. One of the most popular shows
in Chicago, “Don McNeills’s Breakfast Club,” played host
to the wives for three days. This was arranged by the Chi-
cago Park District.

Tuesday evening offered an excellent presentation of The
Solid Gold Cadillac, by the Loyola Players of Chicago, di-
rected by Ruth \V. Schwartz. This had played to standing-
room-only in the Theatre-by-the-Lake this summer. It
showed delegates that a delightful production and good en-
tertainment can be achieved by an amateur theater group.

Separate drOp-in parties, each dedicated to a different ac-
tivity, were arranged by the Local Entertainment Committee
for Wednesday night and were highly successful. They
were led by experts who demonstrated skills and methods in
folk singing, square dancing, and ballroom dancing—~50
delegates learned even as they played. The annual Congress

evening. At this time, the NRA’s special award for National
Service to Recreation was presented to Gaylord Donnelley,
president of R. H. Donnelley Corporation, Chicago, by Mr.

the Association for many years as well as in many Chicago
civic enterprises. Good food and Dr. Goodman’s talk were
followed by lively discussions of his speech in the corridors
while tables were cleared, and then with good music and
dancing.

New Thresholds

Each national meeting of this sort points up new thinking,
new directions, trends and plans, and becomes a threshold
for new experiences in many phases of the recreation job in
the coming year. These new experiences, in turn, lead to
another even better Congress another year, for the stimulat-
ing sort of exchange that helps leaders grow. Next year
—Septetnber 26 through 30—the Shoreham Hotel in our
national capitol, \Vashington, D. C., will offer a pr0pitious
setting for the exciting ambitious program already begin-
ning to take shape in planners’ minds. Banqueting and
dancing under gay lanterns and the stars on the Shoreham
outdoor terrace, for instance, may prove to be one of its de-
lightful occasions, and there will be others.

Four national committees, with some relation to recrea-
tion. are located in Washington and are currently working
with recreation representatives on plans for the immediate
future. This Congress, therefore, will present a golden op-
portunity to interpret the recreation field to these and to
other federal government people and to outline its impor-
tant role in the jet age. It looks as though some interesting
national figures can be present at our meetings; so put on
your thinking caps, and send your suggestions to our Con-
gress secretary, Willard B. Stone, National Recreation As-
sociation, Eight West Eighth Street, New York 11. w

ERHAPS UNDUE STRESS is being put on togetherness,
because it is known from various studies that
children often have great desires to be alone—to read
or to pursue a personally important project. Or it may
be they just want quietness and time for their own

long thoughts. Hence parents need to realize that per-
haps what they consider as the best recreation for their
children may not be what the children need or want.—

I was with a small community, I found
very few sessions that actually applied
to my situation in a community of
15,000-40,000 people. . . . Maybe if the
state presidents were contacted, as well
as the NRA [district] representatives.
this situation could be somewhat allevi-

l have now, as of last June, taken
over the job of superintendent of parks
and recreation for the city of Livonia.
Livonia is the second largest city in
Michigan in land area and soon will be
in population. NRA’s Clarence Rrewer
is doing a yeontan’s job in assisting us
in our growing pains. We couldn’t do
without him.

We are in continuing need of new and
more exciting ways of presenting pro-
grams and facilities to the public. This,
I feel, is where we in recreation are
failing. That is in letting people know
about our experiments and in not ex-
perimenting enough to make new and

Sirs:

As I remember, a year ago at Atlantic
City 1 felt that the commercial exhibit
section of the Congress was not up to
par, but this was certainly corrected at
Chicago. I believe that you probably
had the most ontstanding commercial
exhibit setup that you have had in the
period that l have been attending Con-
gresses. it seems to me that this is
always of terrific importance and an
important part of the Congress to every-
one. Also, i felt that the closing session
this time was perhaps the best i have
ever attended. The three speakers of
the morning all had something to say

with each and SUpport of both.

    
 

October, I 950

    

  

and said it well, and I am sure left every-
one something to think about. lnciden-
tally, in the matter of remarks concern-
ing speakers, but otherwise “apropos of
nothing.” let me say that the banquet
speaker was certainly “different”. . . .
This year's Institute on the Planning
of Facilities was a fine one, well planned
and well carried out. and 1 am very glad
that I attended it. llowever I feel that
the overall Chicago situation would
have been of much more benefit to me.
and probably to many others, had the
time arrangement been somewhat dif-
ferent. Valuable as the Institute is, to
have it on Tuesday and Wednesday of
the Congress more. or less “tears the
heart" out of the Congress for those
attending.

recreation services in the Chicago Public Schools;

and I can truthfully say that my experiences in rec-
reation have developed within me a deep sense of respect
for the many fine accomplishments that recreation can pro-
vide for peOple. Literally, I have seen people “come alive”
from utter dormancy and eventual decay.

As I change hats now from the field of recreation to edu-
cation, 1 see nothing but startling similarities in the basic
objectives in each field. Education and its common ally,
recreation, prescnt a common front in meeting the greatest
challenge that has ever faced any professional or lay group,
that of providing the tools and develOping the skills inherent
in learning as well motivating dcsirable traits in the devel-
opment of personality and character. This is a large order
in a pcriod when everything remains stable and the require-
ments normal. Today, with the complexities of life, the sit-
uation in regard to the schools and recreation grows in-
creasineg more difficult. Such challengcs call for men and
women equipped with courage, wisdom, foresight, and dedi-
cation to minister to the needs of the present while planning
for the unforeseen future at one and the same time. Truly,

ONLY A FEW years ago I was an active member of the

these professions stand out as symbols of dedicated service.

We are all conscious of the many challenges that have
been directed at education during the past few years. Par-
enls and citizens who otherwise had remained more or less
apathetic and complacent suddenly became aroused and
somewhat indignant, stating that the ills of the world were
the result of the failure of the educational system. Such a
practice is not ncw—it is an old story that during periods
of unrest and instability we blame the schools for our com-
mon plight. In like manner, we blame recreation for any
and all problems stemming from teen-age behavior.

Although Ihe educator rec0gnizes the state of panic in
many citizens and the outright injustice of many of the
charges, he has accepted the situation as one rcquiring eval-
nation and study. I refer to the Rockefeller, Iiickover, and
Conant studies. As a result of this soul-searching, many
changes have been made in the existing pattern as a means
of strengthening the program and providing greater op-
portunities to the youth of the nation in a period of great
change. Would it be inappropriate to suggest that a Con-
ant-type objective study be made of recreation to point up
the strengths and weaknesses of this important community
service?

To understand fully the concerns of the educator and his

schools, Chicago Board of Education, and a former director
of the social center program of the Chicago public schools.

reasons for requesting community help and support, we
should be mindful of the following:

I. Thc tremendous surge in enrollment throughout the
country. In Chicago alone we grow an average of fourteen
to fifteen thousand new students each year. Do increased
numbers of pupils have any implications for the recreation
profession?

2. Increased enrollment means additional teachers.

3. Increased enrollment requires more facilities.

4-. Among the many thousands of new enrollees is a large
percentage of newcomers who speak a foreign tongue and
are culturally handicapped in many ways.

5. ln-migration is reflected in phenomenal readjustment
of persons within a city.

6. Curriculum revisions are currently going forward in
all subject areas with more specific stress on science, mathe-
matics, and English, as well as the introduction of a foreign
language at the elementary school level.

Our goal is to motivate and inSpire every child to his
greatest possible potential. We believe that inspiration is
provided with better classrooms, bctter teachers, and that
a more dynamic curriculum will lead to aspirations.

Dr. Benjamin C. Willis, general superintendent of schools
in Chicago, and members of the board of education staff
have been conducting grass-roots budget hearings for the
year 1960 throughout the eighteen districts that comprise
the Chicago public schools. This is but one of the many
innovations he has introduced to obtain the sentiment of
parents and citizens on the functioning of the program of
education in Chicago.

Some of the comments that have been repeated with great
frequency by parents and citizens are:

1. Greater utilization should be made of the school facili-
ties to provide educational, social, and cultural experiences
for children, youth, and adults. The school is the logical
center of community life. It has an auditorium, gymnasi-
um. library, shops, social rooms, and so on, to serve the com-
munity. It can draw all persons regardless of racial, ethnic,
or religious background into a common experience of com-
munity enrichment. A recreation program in a school build-
ing presents the maximum in terms of flexibility, in that it
can be established with little or no expense for capital im-
provements and can be terminated with no loss to the com-
munity whenever this service is no longer needed.

2. Parents further requested improved facilities in the
play area adjacent to the school to enable youngsters to have
wholesome play experiences without being endangered by
the hazards of streets and alleys. As evidence of the plan-
ning of one large city, in attempting to meet its responsibility

to the community, the Chicago public schools have, in the
past six years:

0 Established the Lighted Schoolhouse program in some
one hundred schools throughout the city. This program
added to the playground development that has existed in
Chicago for more than thirty years serves more than two
hundred of the four hundred and fifty public schools.

0 Developed the school-park plan in approximately twenty
locations with the Chicago Park District, acquiring a large
acreage that was developed for recreation purposes, the
school system providing facilities within the school building
to serve as the fieldhouse. This arrangement has been mu-
tually helpful to both agencies as well as having resulted in
more services at less cost for citizens throughout the city.

0 The school board is committed to a ten-year, five-milliona
dollar program of playyard improvement.

0 A study is currently being developed to find ways and
means of Opening school buildings in late afternoons and
evenings for community use of teen-agers and adults at less
cost than now. Cooperative programs have been developed
with group-work agencies to supplement the efforts of the
social center staff in providing specialized services in a few
communities.

Recreation: is in a positive position to give direct aid to
the schools in several of its most pressing problem areas,
specifically:

0 Acceptance of the newcomers.
0 Curbing high percentage of high school “dropouts.”

The spirit of play is inherent in all persons regardless
of age or background. The many children who are cast into
our midst as newcomers present a variety of problems stem-
ming from language barriers, customs, mores, and fears.
Although these youngsters are in dire need of help. they
find it very difficult to make friends and, all too often, re-
frain from attending recreation agencies because they are
afraid. Recreation leaders can be of inestimable assistance
if they make a positive effort to acquaint these children with
the recreation facilities and the program.

Approximately half of the young pe0ple who enter high
school drop out before graduation. This situation is identi-
cal in most of the large eosmopolitan cities in the United
States. Thcse young people, when they leave school, have
few if any skills with which to compete in our increasingly
technical economy and, without a high-school education,
face the inevitable closed doors for occupational Opportuni-
ties in any but the most menial and low-paid jobs. The sad
commentary for this group is that without gainful employ-
men! they become easy prey for teen gangs and subsequent
acts of vandalism and eventual delinquency and crimc.

DECEMBER 1959

It is my judgment, after having listened to the pleas of
literally hundreds of people desiring to drop out of high
school before graduation, that most of the reasons given
were covers for a failure to adjust socially or the feeling of

19

not “belonging. I cannot overcmphasize the importance
of social adjustment and this type of acceptance by his peers
to the young adolescent.

While serving as a high-school administrator I was also
involved as a director of a youth center in the community.
sponsored by the local Kiwanis Club. It was in this situa-
tion that I learned a most important attribute of recreation;
namely, that it is couched in an informal atmosphere.
Young people attend the recreation agency not hy compul-
sion but voluntarily, motivated by personal desire. The
youth center afforded me an opportunity, through this in~
formal atmosphere, to talk to many young people about their
problems. Frankly, I was better able to solve more of the
personal problems of students of the high school while in
the youth center than I was behind my desk at the school.

It would be my very sincere hope that recreation leaders
would realize the tremendous advantage they have in meet
ing young people on this informal basis. If an attitude of
mutual confidence can be established, the recreation leader
can in many instances beeome the most powerful influence
in the life of the individual. livery recreation lcader should
have some professional training in this very important field
of guidance and counseling in solving personal problems.
Teaching recreation is most important but it does not super-
sede the personal relationship.

ln the depressed areas, where p0pulation density is great,
the problems of the recreation leader are magnified and
multiplied. ln addition to sheer numbers, he must cope with
the problems of transiency; broken homes; working moth-
ers; substandards in housing, health. and diet; moral is-
sues; and a total lack of adult supervision. However, it
should be remembered that out of circumstances of this kind
many young people rise to become fine citizens and our
greatest Americans. It is for some teaeher, recreation lead~
er, elergyman, or other interested person to influence the
life in such a manner as to bring to fruition the seeds of
greatness that lie dormant in all individuals.

We admit to some extent that our society has witnessed
some loss of influence of the home and church in our society.
lnstead we have deplored the rise in influence of the street
corner. Yes. the evils of the street corner have. in many in-
stances. become more powerful than the combined influence
of the home. school. and church. All of these agencies should
work toward the combined goal of re-cstahlishing the infln-
ence and leadership of the home.

RECREATION GOALS
IN A PSYCHIATRIC

HOSPITAL

Lois Fahs Timmins, Ed.D.

LL HOSPITALS, and certainly psy-
Achiatric hospitals, whether fed-

eral, state, or private, have certain
elements in common. All deal with in-
dividuals who are atypical in some as-
peet of their functionin". All are fun-
damentally for the purpose of restoring
the health of the patient. All must, there-
fore, have an orientation primarily and
principally medical.

Despite their similarities, each hospi-
tal has its. own particular pliilos0phy,
its own problems of finance, its own
unique staff. and develops a program
suitable for meeting the needs of its par-
ticular clientele. The goals of a rec-
reational therapy program. therefore.
must be integrated with the overall
treatment philosophy of the hospital,
and, in this instance, will be described
in terms of our own particular hospital

setting.
The Setting
Timberlawn Sanitarium in Dallas,

Texas, is a 106-bed, private psychiatric
hospital, owned and operated by its staff
of psychiatrists. Facilities are available
for treatment of all types of emotional
illnesses, exclusive of narcotic addic-
tion. The treatment staff consists of
eight senior psychiatrists; three resi-
dent psychiatrists; three externcs; grad-
vocational and
aides; [WU clinical psychologists; a so-

uate nurses. nurses,
eial worker; an occupational therapist;
and a recreational therapist.

Only patients for whom the active

treatment program will be beneficial are

kept at Timberlawn. If a patient cannot
be helped, he is sent home. Patients
requiring a longer period of care are
transferred to state or Veterans Admin-
istration hospitals, or are sent to nurs-
ing homes for custodial care.
Timberlawn is a closed-type hospital;
outside doors to patients’ living areas
are locked. However, even patients on
disturbed divisions are free during the
day to move from their rooms into the
lounge areas. and at specified times may
walk or play in the patio. As a patient’s
social behavior becomes more accept-
able. he is transferred to convalescent
divisions of the hospital where there are
fewer restrictions, greater freedom to
move about hospital grounds, and a
more complete recreation program.
Facilities for recreation include a
well-apportioned and moderately sized
lounge; an outdoor enclosed patio for
disturbed patients; a large recreation
area with horseshoe, croquet, shulIle-
board, and volleyball areas; and an out-
door swimming pool with cabana and
barbecue pit. In this h05pital setting,
some general goals of our recreational
therapy program have been develOpcd
through cooperation between the recre-

ational therapist and each patient’s
doctor.

Goals of the Program

1. To assist the patient in his adjust-
ment to confinement. When a patient
is admitted, it may be the first time in
his life he has been with people in a sit-
uation where there is no escape. It may
be the first time he has been wholly and
utterly dependent upon the goodness of
other people—a goodness he fundamen-

   

tally doubts at the moment. He is sud-
denly separated from everyone he has
ever known, and may be quite eon-
vinced he will never see any member of
his family or any of his friends again.
“Here I am, locked up like a criminal
with a bunch of nuts,” he says to him-
self. While there are a few patients who
relax within the womblike security of
hospital walls, most patients either re-
sent or are afraid of being dependent
upon others.

For this reason, endless devices and
attitudes are utilized to create an atmos-
phere of warmth and friendliness inside
the hospital, behind the locked doors.

Through recreational therapy, this
warmth is stimulated in many ways.
One way is to call each patient by his
name. A name is the device mankind
has developed for identifying the
uniqueness of each person. Our name is
one of our attributes that makes us feel
like an important individual, like a per-
son worthy of being loved. It is aston-
ishing how patients manage to sit for
two or three weeks and never know the
names of people sitting next to them.
Teaching people each other’s names is
one of the specific functions of recrea-
tion. If we know someone's name it is
easier to be friendly.

A personal interest is shown in each
patient by answering his many ques-
tions. During recreation activities there
are many opportunities to talk with a
patient about his family. to look at the
pictures of his children, and to listen
attentively to whatever he may have to
say. Warmth is also created by respon-
siveness to humor. Patients in psychia-
tric hospitals frequently have a height-

RECREATION

 

encd sense of humor. It is therapeutic
to laugh, especially since emotional ill-
nesses have enough gruesome aspects
without taking everything too seriously.
We laugh a great deal. We laugh about
everything, about ourselves, our treat-
ments. Twiec a week we broadcast a
disc-jockey show planned and written
by the patients. The hospital patient
newspaper is entitled the Happy Valley
Spark—“All the fits that are news to
print."'

2. To assist patients in better reality
testing. A frequent characteristic of
major mental illnesses is a withdrawal
from, and distortion of, reality. Patients
may experience delusions, hallucina-
tions, and periods of extreme confusion.
Our program offers such individuals
many concrete reality experiences. Real
games are played with real balls, real
bats, real rules, and a real score. There
are real teams, taking real turns, win-
ning or being defeated. We are making
observations regarding the impact of
specific “reality forcing" activities, such
as picture quizzes on transportation,
recreation activities, license plates, liv-
ing people, foods, and animals. A Spe-
cial quiz on “abstractions” has been de-
signed to challenge the preoccupation
with detail typical of the patient with
a schizophrenic reaction.

In conversations with patients, the
recreational therapist also represents
reality. “We will square dance tonight
at 6:30.” When a patient gets too far
out in left field, we try to bring him
back. For example. when he says, “Oh,
isn’t it nice to have someone here from
the Red Cross tonight,” the therapist
says, “1 am not from the lied Cross. I
work here at Timberlawn.” When a pa-
tient puts paste on her face, the therapist
may say, “This is paste. We will use
it to paste this colored paper onto the
white paper." This is reality.

3. To build sell-esteem. Most of the
patients in our hospital lack self-esteem:
they do not feel that they are of much
account as human beings. They feel in-
adequate, incapable, unintelligent, un-
nicc. We make an attempt to structure
all activities so patients will have an 0p-
portunity to learn to approve of them-
selves, to be successful, to gain self-es-
teem. A patient from a ranch in north
Texas, recently told us, “When I came
to Timberlawn, I thought 1 wasn’t much.

DECEMBER 1959

Through all these soeials you organize,
l figger I'm no smaller than the rest.
I'm just like all the others."I

In working with patients in a psy-
chiatric hospital, we try to be people
worthy of trust. If we tell a patient we
will do something for him or with him,
we make a point of carrying it out to the
best of our ability. For that particular
patient at that one particular moment
in time, the recreational therapist may
represent all humanity. The patient
tests the therapist. He says to himself,
“lf she disappoints me, 1 can’t trust any-
body." A person who cannot trust any-
body cannot develop self-esteem.

Each patient must be helped to be-
lieve he has the eapaeity to recover.
This belief is also part of self-esteem.
Most patients do recover. Despite the
bitter fact that all do not recover, the
recreational therapist must continue to
believe in the potential for getting well.

4. To provide Opportunities for ex-
pression 0/ hostility. Almost all patients
in our hospital are people who are an-
gry with other people. Therefore, spe-
cial games allow patients to express this
hostility. One game has been devised
that consists of throwing bean bags at
efligies of a man and a woman. The pa-
tient has to choose which figure he is
going to hit. lie earns points if he hits
the one he chooses. He forfeits points
if he hits the wrong one. One patient,
who had been an expert pitcher on a
ball team only a few years ago, was to-
tally unable to hit the woman he said
he was going to bit. He missed the wo-
man by about three feet every time, but
knocked down the man with unfailing
regularity.

Another game, “Funnel Ball,” is a
team game played in the restricted areas
of the disturbed-division lounges. Wild
and raucous, it involves a great deal of
pushing. shoving, and elattering, and
was so designed deliberately. There are
aggressive aspects to many other recre-
ation activities that may be augmented
through particular approaches in organ-
ization and leadership.

Nothing can be really taught which is
not lived. Wisdom is never an iso.
lated theory, but knowledge applied

and utilized.—FREDERICK Maven,
PHD, in Education [or Creative Liv-
ing (Whittier Books).

 

Often a staff member serves as a tar-
get for verbal aggression. We become
human dart boards, with poisoned darts
flying thick and fast in our direction.
In these instances, we try not to suggest
to the patient he has said something
wrong. ln other cases, we may deliber-
ately try to reflect feelings patients ob-
v iously have but are unable to verbalize.
We may say to a patient, “You look ter-
rildy mad today." And she'll say, “You
bet I am. I'm really going to get even
with that doctor if 1 can ever get him to
stand still long enough to catch him."

5. To prepare the patient [or his re-
turn to society. It is one of our goals to
help in the preparation of the patient
for his return to gainful occupation and
social acceptability in eonnnunity life.
The recreational therapy program serves
as a liaison in several ways. We try to
teach patients lcisu re interests and skills
that will carry over to the “outside.”
At various times. we have had lessons
in checkers, chess, bridge, poker, social
dancing, and swimming.

We try to help the patient learn to
place his focus on other pe0ple instead
of on himself. Those who are convalesc-
ing are given many positions of leader-
ship with their own peer group, and they
assist with the activities on the more dis-
turbed divisions. Further, at division
meetings, individuals are elected to
carry out various roles in recreation
leadership. By fulfilling these roles, pa-
tients learn to assume responsibility, to
take the consequences of their own ae-
tions, and not to be afraid that others
will reject or disapprove of them.

Recreational therapy helps patients
to look back on their hospitalization—
to get a vista of the road they have trav-
eled, and to appreciate their own ea-
paeities for improved living. One pa-
tient said, “When 1 first came here, the
doctor told me I was withdrawn. 1 did
not understand what being withdrawn
meant until 1 got into these social ac-
tivities. Now 1 know what I have to
learn to be when 1 get out.”

in the last analysis, activities and
program are the modality, but the basic
emphasis in recreational therapy must
be on being, not on doing. Our funda-
mental goal is to give each patient an
opportunity to mature, to grow to his
full stature, to become the person he is
capable of being. #

leisure hours of our boys at the State
Agricultural and Industrial School for
delinquent boys, a few miles from Roch-

Crafts seem to be one succcssful an-

boys have previously lcarned some craft
fundamentals in vocational schools, set-
tlement houses, boys’ clubs, private
agencics, or other institutions. Al-
though those with actual craft skills con-
stitute a minority, they help us to arouse
an interest in others and are cooperative
in helping to teach crafts to less skilled
boys.

At the beginning of the scason, ap-
proximately twenty-five percent of them
are interested in, or at least curious
enough about, some hobby to “give it

instances an entire cottage group will
participate from October through April.

Two-fifths of the monics in our rec-
reation fund and approximately one-
fourth of the recreation supervisor’s
timc are devoted to this program, con-
ductcd in the cottage area. To some, it
may appear that thcre is too much dcvo-
tion to this one activity.

Although the best scores on our boy’s
mental tests show that eighty-five per-
cent fall in the average, or better. range
of intelligence, most suffer rather severe
educational retardation. Reading level
falls around the sixth grade. arithmetic
around the fifth, and the boys who have
not progressed satisfactorily in school
find satisfaction and a means of achiev-
ing rccognition through their crafts—
and crafts therefore become important.

Teaching Crafts. For the past ten
years we have had excellent classes
taught by outside teachers, and for three
yea rs Frank Staples, long-time craft spe-
cialist on the National Recreation As-
sociation staff, spent the greater part of
a week with us. He worked directly with
the boys in the evenings and spent his

 

afternoons with [he men who supcrvisc

of the Memorial Art Callcry has also
been teaching the supervisors. Other-

Drawing is taught in the school. Art
materials needed in the cottages are sup-

arts are taught in two general shops
and in the machine, hakery, tailor, weld-
ing, carpenter, and print shops. Skills
learned in these shops are often of such
nature that the boys can, by getting nec-
essary materials from the recreation of-

stored with supplies in a small rootn or
closet. A workbench, small tables, and
even Ping-pong tables are brought into
use during hobby time.

Making something in crafts is not a
mandatory part of the program. All
boys are welcome to participate. Those
not interested are permitted to read. lis-
ten to radios, write letters, or in some
way keep themselves busy while under
supervision.

Whenever a new craft is introduced,
the number of boys learning is governed
by the work space and materials avail-
able and the number interested. Work-
ing with more than six at a time is cum-
bersome and often wasteful of materials
and man-hours. When many boys are
interested, the supervisor teaches small
groups, and these in turn become teach-
ers for the others.

The first complete weekend of each
month is “Visiting Weekend,” when
parents and relatives are permitted to

visit and spend a few hours with the
boys. For the past ten years the first
weekend in May has been llobby Show
Weekend. The exhibits, which include
hooths set up in the assembly hall by
all the cottages, the vocational shops,
the academic school, and the Boy Scouts
lodge, are Open to the public for three
days. Hundreds of people visit at that
time and the exhibits have attracted
close to a thousand people. The boys
who have been the main contributors
to this program throughout the winter
act as guides.

0n the Thursday prior to the Open-
ing, members of the Rochester Rotary
Club spcnd from three to four hours
judging exhibits. Winners are taken to

the movies and dinners. the grand win-
ners to a day of fun at an amusement
park or on an airplanc ride. In all. there
are over one hundred winners of the
four prizes in the various categories.
Crafts are taught and encouraged, to
give the boy something constructive to
do during his leisure hours in the cot-
tagcs. Then, too, crafts, such as snow
sculpturing during the winter months,
encourage creativeness and wholesome
outdoor exercise. Without this incen-
tive all too many hours would be spent
indoors. Naturally the cottage displays
are not all equal in attractiveness, but
any boy who has something in the show
is proud and anxious to show what he

has made. #

 

The normal boy, being a primitive animal, takes to competition and battle.
In the days before our eivilization beeame so perfeet, he matehed his wits with
the birds and the bees and the fish. He is today separated from Mother Earth
and all her works, exeept the weather. The outlet of euriosity in exploring the
streams and the fields is closed to him. The mysteries of the birds and ihe bees
and fish are denied. He eannot even see all of the sky at one time.

This pavement boy, in faet, has a life of stairs, light switehes, alleys, fire
eseapes, bells, and eobblestones, and a ehanee to get run over by a truek.
Inasmuch as he eannot eontend with nature, he is likely to take on contention
with a p0liccman.—-HERBERT HOOVER.

It, THOSE Texas dolls! No, we
0 speak not of the beautiful live
kind in the June-moon songs,
but of the infinite variety exhibited by

owners. young and old, at recreation
department doll shows jammed by rec-

ord crowds of spectators. “Our annual
doll show is one of the most enthusiasti-
cally received projects of the depart-
ment, usually attended by thousands of
persons from the very young to the very
old,” reports Bernard Davis, director of
the Galveston Parks and Recreation De-
partment. Texas City and Corpus Chris-
ti likewise report similar acclaim for
their shows, as do recreation depart-
ments in other parts of Texas. This is
true, too, in many other parts of the
country. With genuine effort and good
promotion, doll shows can become a
major special event.

In Galveston, Christmas dolls are
taken to a doll-show party in February,
while they are still new and fresh for
entry. One of the big attractions at Cal-
veston is exhibitions of noncompeting
collections of rare and unusual dolls,
including doll furniture and doll houses.
There were 773 entries in Calveston’s
last doll show.

For recreation leaders interested in
planning such an event, here is the gen-
eral setup, as outlined by Dubba Doo-
ley, Texas City director of recreation

and former recreation director in Cal-
veston: There is no registration or ad-
mission iee. The event is open to the
public—~boys, girls and adults—of all
ages. A panel of judges awards prize
ribbons to the winners of first, second,
and third places in each of the categor-
ies in which dolls are registered. Divi-
sions or classifications can be: largest,
smallest, oldest, most unique, character,
bride, rag, boy, animal, twin, family,
European, Oriental, and miscellaneous
foreign.

Publicity. on which the success of
the show greatly depends, is via local
newspapers, radio and television sta-
tions. Posters are also placed in schools
and recreation centers, and announce-
ments made in the schools.

Dolls are brought in for registration
two or three days in advance. Forms
are filled out in duplicate and a number
attached to each doll. This number cor-
responds with the number on the regis-
tration form. There is no limit to the
number of dolls one person may enter.
(One registration form is used for each
registrant, regardless of the number of
dolls entered). The number of dolls one
person enters in each category is writ-
ten in beside the respective category
on the registration form, and the total
number of all dolls entered by each is
shown on the entry form. The original

registration fornn is retained by the rec-
rcation departnnent, tlne duplicate given
to registrannt.

Display tables should be set nnp the
day before the registration, with signs
showing categories of dolls. As dolls
are brought in and immediately regis-
tered. tlnose assisting with the registra-
tion: place their entries on the proper
tables. All who have doll stands are re-
quested to bring them, but tlne stands
are :not a contest entrance requirenuennt.

Three judges named several weeks
prior to the date of the show, award the
ribbons on: the morning before the open-
i ng of the show. If experts are not avail-
able, attempts should be made to pro-
eure persons who have a keen interest
in and some knowledge of dolls. In or-
der that the judging nnay be impartial,
names of owners do nnot appear on or
:near the dolls nor are registration fornns
shown the judges. The ribbon awards
are pinned on the winning dolls by the
judges innmediately after judging; and
the owners’ names are later determined
by means of the dolls’ numbers. A pre-
pared fornn is given: to the judges to fill
in, and space is provided for registrant
or owner’s :nanne, to be written in: later
annd given: to the press for publicity.

The tables on: which the dolls are ex-
hilnited are roped off, and earry signs
of “Do Not Touch.” Displays often in-
clude very valuable dolls, annd doll
shows should therefore be held in: a
building or center where a watchman:
is on duty day annd night. lnnsuranee
can: be an added protection: to the city.

Entrance to a show is made by one
door annd exit by another. While the
show is in: progress, employees of the
recreation department are stationed be-
hind the ropes between the tables to see
that no one touches any entry.

lnnnnediately after the event, entries
are returned to owners who turn: in the
dUplicate registration form or entry
slip. Recreation: ennployecs are sta-
tioned at the various tables to see that
owners rceeive their dolls. This process
is simplified by the corresponding num-
bers on the dolls and the registration
fornns. An: employee stationned at the
exit door picks up the duplicate regis-
tration form after all dolls entered there-
on have been returned annd checked off.
Any remaining dolls should he picked
up on the next work day, if possible.

Neta Blaek, program director in Tex-
as City, reports that “volunteers from
the Girl Scouts help with registration

and during the show by staying inside
the roped-off area, wlniel: insures safety
of dolls fronu admirers who like to
touch." At the last show in Texas City
an exhibit demonstrated the tlnerapeutic
values of gardening with approximately
thirty dolls depicting various aspects.
In: addition, the show included a private
collection: of rare foreign dolls and sev-
eral lnistorieal collections of handmade,
old, and unique types of dolls. Among
the spectators were a surprising number
of men who viewed and commented fa-
vorably on: the displays.

For the 1957 Corpus Christi doll
show staff member Frank Olstowski
transformed the exposition hall into a
:nnagie forest annd over twenty thousand
viewed the show over a four-day period.
Special events included free puppet
shows by Junior League puppeteers.
and “imported” exhibits such as egg-
shell dolls :nadc by a young polio vie-
tinn of Ashtabula, Ohio. He had taken:
nnp the doll hobby to regain strength in:
his fingers annd hands.

These Texas shows are not haphaz-
ard, thrown-together affairs but planned
produetionns that have become a major
event in their connununnities. #

SIX NEW GAMES

Lola Sadlo, Sketches by Ernest J. Velardi, Jr.

H ere are six new Christmas games created by the author
from fancy, need, thrift, imagination, nostalgia, curiosity,
and sheer desire. They can be played by those of all ages—
from intermediate elementary grades through “keen-agers.”

Decorate the Christmas Tree

Created: W hen the author was return-
ing from a national convention and
saw an inebriated, bald-pated, rosy-
complexioned individual standing on
a train platform. A red vest added to
an effect that made him appear some-
what like a Christmas tree.

Number of Players: Any number.
Formation: Teams play in scattered
positions on the game area.
Materials: Boxes, equivalent in num-
her to the number of teams, filled with

 

old discarded Christmas decorations,
such as tinsel, icicles, paper stars. and chains, cotton, etcet-
era. (Do not use objects which can break.)
Directions :

1. Divide the group into teams.

2. Tell each team to select one of its group to he the
Christmas tree, which is to be decorated by the others 011
the team.

3. Give box of Christmas decorations to each team.

4. Set a time limit of from five to ten minutes.

5. Have “trees” parade.

Objective: Committee selects the bcst decorated tree and
most deserving team.

’Twas the Night Before Christmas

 

Created: When in a moment of nostalgia the author’s favor-

ite poem was recalled and a pattern of figures, cards, and the
first four lines of the poem became a game configuration
for a mixer.

Number of Players: Any number.

Formation: Scattered, to begin with, or sealed at tables.
Materials: Three-by-eight cardboard, or heavy construction-
paper plaques susl)endcd by string to go over the heads of

FOR CHRISTMAS

players, equal to the number of participants at the party.

On each is printed a line of the first four lines of the poem:

’Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. . . .

In other words, if there are thirty-two players, there will be
eight sets of cards with four lines in each set.
Directions :

I. Suspend the mixed cards, face down, around the necks
of all players.

2. At the “Co!” everyone is to turn over his card and
scramble about to find the other three lines of the poem.
Objective: To form a line of four persons with the poem’s
lines in the correct order. The first group to do the above
is the winning team.

Head Autograph

Crcated: From curiosity and sheer de-
sire to present something new to the
recreation directors in the Los An-
geles Department of Recreation and
Parks at their 1957 annual Christmas
party.
Number of Players: Any number.
Formation: May be seated in audito-
rium, around tables, or in any posi-i
tions in game area.
ll'latcrials: Sheets of eight-by-tcn draw-
ing paper equivalent in number to the
group of participants. A piece of col-
ored crayon for each individual.
Directions : I
I

 

1. Distribute paper and crayons.

2. Give instructions to the participants that at the word
“Co!” they are to place the papers at0p their heads, and
write their full names, using left hands, or hand not ordi-
narily used.

3. Pass paper to neighbor to see if he can read your
writing.

Objectivc: This is an icebreaker and a “fun” conversation
piece.

Picassos and Rembrandts

Created: From sense of thrift to use other side of paper
after playing above game.

Number of Players: Any number.

Formation: Same as in Head Autograph.

Materials: Same as in Head Autograph.

Direct ions :
1. Tell participants to print their names legibly on the

side upon which they wrote their names.

2. Give instructions now to turn the paper and draw a
Christmas scene atop their heads. The hand regularly used
now gives a slight advantage.

3. Collect drawings and crayons.

Objective: To uncover latent talent, and later to proclaim
the winners.

Christmas Package

C reatctl : W hen need arose for a Christ-
mas game that could be played in a
small area by older people at an adult
arts-and-crafts center.

Number of Players: Any number.
Formation: Teams play in scattered
positions on the game area.
Materials: Packages, equivalent in
number to the number of teams, of
mixed Christmas wrappings, tissue pa-
per, old ribbons and bows, seals, and
what-not.

Directions :

1. Divide the group into teams.

2. Tell each team to select one of its group to he the hu-

man Christmas package that is to be wrapped aml trimmed
by the others on the team.

 

3. Give package of miscellaneous “wrappings and trim.
mings” to each team.

4. Set a time limit of approximately ten minutes.
Objective: Some “packages” can move and some cannot;
therefore the committee of judges can make the rounds to
select the most handsome Christmas “package.”

Ski Relay

Created: When the author saw a group
of dry-land skiers going through the
motions of the activity on one of the
local playgrounds.
A'nmber 0/ Players: Any even number.
Formation: In relay teams at desired
distances apart.
xxxxx xxxxx

0 0 O O 0 0 0 O 0 0
Materials: Skis of any size cut out of
construction paper (one pair per
team). Shoeboxes for ski boots (one
pair per team). A little artificial snow. Goggles, if you
wish.
Direct ion 5 :

 

1. Divide the group into teams in relay formation.

2. At the command “Co!” the first member is to step
into shoeboxes, don goggles, step into paper skis and ski
across to other member on his team. He sheds his equip-
ment for the other memher who repeats the motions to the
other side.

3. For variety and atmosphere the leader can place oh-
cles in the path and sprinkle a little snow about.

Objective: The first team to complete the cycle is adjudged
e winner.

A NAME GAME

William lirederickson, .lr., sulwrintendent of recreation in
Los Angeles, worked out this party idea, which can he used
for several purposes. For coorccreati()n groups, each person
is asked to sign his own name at the top of the sheet, then to
secure the signatures of other guests on the lines of the star.
Boys sign their names on the lines ending in stars; girLs use
the lines ending in circles. When the star is complete with
names (getting the names is a mixer in itself) it can he
used:

1. As a mixer to find partners for dances or games. The
leader may borrow the sheet from any person and read the
names of pairs beginning at the top and running from left
to right.

2. As a game. The leader may take the guest list aml read
off names. The participants may check in pencil as in bingo.
The game may then be won by a player having any two
names forming a straight line; any four names forming a
cross.

The same form can be used for any number of pairing
for additional games. The twenty-six numbered lines at the
bottom may be used for several purposes. Each person may
try to write the titles of the dance tunes played during the
evening, the winners receiving a small prize. 0r each person
may use the lines to write the names of other players. or for
any purpose that the imagination of the leader may devise.

[IE CITY OF Garden Grove, Cali-
Tfornia, celebrated its third anni-

versary as an incorporated city
in June. New cities in this fast growing
state are not too unusual but the growth
pattern of this particular Orange Coun-
ty community has been fabulous. In
1951, the total population was some
eighteen hundred persons; now it is in
excess of sixty-fivc thousand.

In 1957, when I assumed directorship
of Garden Crove’s first departmcnt of
recreation and parks, there were no mu-
nicipal leisure facilities: no program,
no staff, no administrative structure,
nor any of the other component parts
comprising a typical recreation and
parks program. The city was fortunate,
howcver, in having a city administrator
and a city council with a great amount
of foresight. Earlier they had acquired
a forty-acre park site from the US. Gov-
crnment, and were also negotiating for
a small county-owned park within the
city limits.

The average age of the populace was
rather young, the average annual in-
come higher than most communities of
similar size, and the community pri-
marily residential. I did not have the
slightest idea as to their cultural and
leisure needs and desires. The logical
manner to obtain this and other infor-
mation, therefore, was to conduct a com-
munitywide recreation survey. The
questionnaires were separated into
three age and interest groupings: one
for elementary and intermediate

and parks in Garden Grove, California.

services already available.

schools; one for adults and families;
and a special teen-age questionnaire. In
this way, chances were that the response
might be greater, because members of
each group would feel that their own in-
terests were being explored.

Survey Mechanics

The mechanics in setting up, distrib-
uting, collecting, and tabulating the re-
sults wcre simple but effective. Forty-
eight thousand questionnaircs were
printed. Distribution was carefully
planned to reach every home and every
person in the connnunity. The elemen-
tary and intermediate school question-
naires were distributed to each child,
through the cooperation of the schools,
these to be taken home and filled out in
a family group. The questionnaire for
the adults accompanied that for the pre-
teens, and these two forms were distrib-
utcd in the classroom one day and re-
turned the next. The teen-age question-
naires were distributed to the high
schools and filled out by each studcnt
during an advisory period. We felt it
was wiser to have them fill these forms
in the classroom rather than at home.
We knew, from past experience, that
written material to be taken home by
teen-agers quite often finds its way into
paper airplanes or into the nearest
wastebasket.

Wider distribution was obtained by
including parochial schools and
churches; and simple clip-out question-
naires were printed in local newspapers.
The adult-family questionnaires were
also spotted in shopping centers, stores,

V. E. (Gene) Rotsch

the chambcr of commerce, city hall, and
other focal points throughout the com-
munity, for pick-up distribution. Even
the response on this latter, rather loosely
structured, method was very rewarding.
Upon complction of the survey, ques-
tionnaires were collected and brought
to city hall for tabulation.

Twcnty-five ladies from local PTA’s .l
voluntcered to tabulate the results. Spe-
cial shects were broken down into cate-
gories of interest and into the three orig-
inal age-level groups. The PTA ladies
were dividied into two- or three-person
teams and proved to be highly inter-
ested and competent in their work. We
uscd a one-to-ten sampling ratio on the
general questions on each form, but
went a step further on certain questions
and tabulated evcry answer. Upon com-
pletion of the tabulation, we compiled
the results and published thcm in pcr-
centiles. The entire survey took three
wccks.

   
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

Revealing Response

The numerical response was beyond
our fondest hopes and expectations. Of
the forty-eight thousand forms distribu-
ted, we received better than a twenty-
five-percent response. This, in itself,
was rather amazing, but it was even
more amazing to find the strong opin-
ions expressed. People were honest and
forthright and highly interested in the
entire procedure. We did try one gim-
mick, to determine the actual amount
of interest going into the filling out of
each questionnaire. We purposely elim-
inated swimming or aquatic activities

Racamrios

from the list of program interest ques-
tions. Many persons spotted this omis-
sion immediately and as high as eight
percent wrote it in. Many of the ques-
tions were answered exactly as we, as
recreation professionals, had expected.
However, there were other rather sur-
prising facts revealed.

Having conducted a similar survey
in another city, I had found that there
are multiple values.' both immediate and
long range in nature:

0 The creation of an immediate public
awareness of the fact that “recreation
is here": thus actually drawing the pub-

lic into the early planning stages of a
new recreation and parks department.
0 Learning, at firsthand, from the pub-
lie of all ages and interest levels, what
their particular activity and program
are.

0 Utilization: of the obtained results,
in the structure and operation of the
department's program.

We feel that we have learned many
important facts on a local basis by con-
ducting this survey. Many of these facts
are of local interest only; others may
have statewide, even national import.

Ninety-five percent of our local pop-

 

ulation has moved into the eounnunity
during the past seven years, most of
them from communities where munici-
pal recreation programs were already
established and operating smoothly.
These peOple had become accustomed
and conditioned to properly conducted,
organized municipal recreation. They
like it, and realize its importance and iLs
ultimate social and cultural values. This
local survey has proveu to he a compli-
ment and a vote of confidence for the
entire profession, if nothing else,
through the tremendous public re-
sponse. #

Financing Delegates’ Expenses

 

A POLICY PROBLEM facing many recreation departments

is how to finance delegates’ attendance at national, dis-
trict, and state conferences. To ascertain practices in other
large cities, the District of Columbia recreation department
sent out a questionnaire, answered by sixteen cities of 500,-
000 population or over. Questions and a summary of re-
plies from fifteen cities follow.

Q. Does your agency pay travel and subsistence costs
for employee attendance at conferences?

A. All fifteen agencies answered yes. Ten pay the ac-
tual cost without restrictions. One pays all travel plus $15,
$20, or $25 per day subsistence; another, sevcn cents a m ilc
and $16.75 per day; and another eight cents a mile, with an
indefinite subsistence payment, depending on conference
location.

Q. Is payment authorized for registration fees, banquets,
and other oflicial functions?

A. Payments are authorized by all fiffeen agcncics.

Q. For what kind of conferences is payment authorized?

A. One agency is restricted to one conference per year,
the superintendent deciding which a? 'ational confer-
cnces are an thorizcd by the other four n. Tcn cities also
pay travel and subsistence to sectional, district, or state con-
ferences.

Among the conferences mentioned, the National Recrea-
tion Association appearcd fourtccn times; the American
I nstitutc of Park Executives, nine times; the American Rec-
reation Society, six times; and the American Association
for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, three times.
A number of other special interest conferences were men-
tioned once or twice.

Q. Are there other than financial restrictions on attend-
ance, such as distance, length of stay, degree of conference
participation, and so forth?

A. Eight cities have no rcstrictions. Three need approval
from higher ogicials. One is limited to one conference, not
to exceed five days. Othcrs use program content or distance
as further determinants.

Q. What level of personnel is permitted to attend con-

Dcccsraaa 1959

ferences, with costs paid by the agency?

A. Only one city restricts attendance to the superintend-
cnt. Two-thirds of the cities permit attendance by super-
visors and higher. Two cities will send any professional
employee to appropriate conferences. One will send recre-
ation leaders to state confercnccs only; another, to a na-
tional conference, if nearby.

Q. Are employees on full-duty status while attending?

A. All cities reported yes and, with one exception, while
traveling to and from it.

Q. Are employees required to file written reports?

A. Seven cities require them; two, oral; and five, none.
In one city, a report is customary but not compulsory.

Q. How much is budgeted for out-of-town travel and
subsistence?

A. There is a wide range, varying from $6,350 in one
city to $300 in another. Thrcc cities budget $1,200 each.
Tu'o agcncics allocate funds as needed. One agency has rc-
ceivcd no funds for the past three years. The source, in all
cases, was apprOpriatcd funds.

Q. Do you note any trends to restrict or increase funds
for conference travel?

A. Wine cities report a restrictive trend ; fivc. no trend;
and one, a variation from year to year.

Conclusions

0 All cities recognize the importance of conference attend-

ance.

o It is generally agreed that all levels of conferences are

important.

0 Cities recognize the importance of attendance by all

levels of supervisory and administrative personnel.

0 Most cities budget annually for conference expenses,

but imply amount budgeted is not necessarily ample.
The fact that replies were received from fifteen of the

sixteen cities queried, and that all want copies of the sum-

mary, indicates that questions of travel and subsistence for

attendance at profmsional conferences vitally concerns

everyone. #

FLORIDA. The capital improvement program in San lord
has resulted in a new civic center that cost $244,436. The
building, covering one—and-an-eighth acres, filled the city's
standing need for an auditorium and recreation center to
serve all age groups. The domed auditorium, with a seating
capacity of 1,400, was constructed by using Rilco laminated
wood arches that give a roof height of thirty-two feet and
a clear span of eighty-six feet. One end of the arch meets
the floor level at the rear of the auditorium, while the other
end rests on the laminated wood proscenium arch of the
stage. An interesting aspect was the use of fir two-by-fours,
on edge, for the roof deck, necessitated by the complex
curves of the dome (see photograph).

The auditorium dome received a white plastic reflective
coating that guarantees the inside temperature to be within
one degree of the outdoor shade temperature. ]n addition
to this reflective roof coating, fixed aluminum sunshades of
a honeycomb design are used to cover the glass area of the
auditorium walls to increase the efficiency of the air condi-
tioning.

At the side and in line with the back of the auditorium,
a long wing swings out in a half-moon shape to provide an
area for youth recreation. While completely separated from
the auditorium section, this glass-front recreation wing re-
mains an integral part of the entire structure through the
use of covered walks and passageways. Folding wall parti-
tions are used to provide a flexible use of this area by the
division of the recreation wing into separate rooms of any
desired size. The open area, encompassed by the auditorium
and recreation wing, has been utilized for a concrete patio
that provides an area for outdoor dancing as well as games
and roller skating.

GEORGIA. Callaway Stadium in LaCrange opened this
fall with a capacity crowd of 5,700 witnessing a high school
football game. The stadium seats 5,014 and was built with
funds provided by the Callaway Community Foundation. It
is available on a rental basis to LaGrange and Troup County
citizens for all activities. The Bermuda-sodded playing field
of regulation size has an 18-inch elevation in the center and
drainage outlets at 50-foot intervals on each side. An under-
ground irrigation system will make it possible to keep the
grass in good shape during the summer. The stands are con-
structed of concrete with frames that were poured into place,
with tiers made of prestressed concrete on which “form-
fitting” seats are placed.

At long last, Origin has a community center it can call
its own. For years Griffin’s recreation center had moved
from building to building. Finally, the city’s recreation ad-
visory board decided the time had come for a permanent
building. Plans were drawn and a nonprofit organization.
Civic Youth Incorporated, organized. The city then passed
a referendum to give the CY] a plot of ground at Municipal
Park. With a loan from a bank and the Peace Officers As-
sociation, the CY] was able to start construction. At present.
the city leases the building from CY]. In ten years, when the
building is paid for, thc CY] will give the building to the
city and the Griffin Recreation Department (see photograph,
upper right).

MARYLAND. 111 September RockviHe formally dedicated
its first recreation center, devoted entirely to teen-age ac-
tivities. The building, in Elwood Smith Memorial Park.

consists of a 20’-by-38’ lounge area, an enclosed office for the
director, and a main Floor, 38’-hy-48'; total cost $39,000.

MICHIGAN. The Kiddie Korral in Mansfield Tot Park,
Port Huron, has solved the problem of what to do with
stumps too costly to remove. They

were topped with circular marine
plywood and transformed into min-
iature tables for tots. Half-moon
seats accompany the tables. The tot
park is the joint effort of the United
Paperworkers and Papermakers lo-
cal and the city recreation department. Under a two-year
joint agreement, the union agreed to give the money for
the play equipment and the city assumed responsibility for
the planning, purchase, and installation of the apparatus,
as well as management of the park. The area. about one
acre of heavily wooded land, is in a neighborhood where
recreation facilities had always been lacking.

 

NE‘V JERSEY. The state has approved a plan for a 50'-
by-40’ bathing beach on the Navesink River, Red Bank, and

it is scheduled for completion by spring. The area will be
dredged twenty-five feet from the shore, filled with sand, and
will be roped off. Ocean City has reclaimed three miles of

beachfront as the result of a giant sand pumping project.
As a result of a referendum in the November elections

communities may now legally conduct games of chance
which, according to a 1956 state supreme court decision, had

been a violation of state gambling laws. Operation of the
games f by local option“! is restricted to amusement parks,
resort areas. and to fund-raising events for religious, char-
itable. fraternal, or civic purposes.
twenty-five cents with prizes limited to a value of no more
than $15. Each operator must pay an annual license fee of
$100 and a state amusement gamcswontrol commissioner
will be named to establish regulations for the games.

NEW MFXICO. Recreation is expanding rapidly in Cal-
lup. The town has a new 100'-by-70' swimming pool, com-
plete with bathhouse and wading pool. This outdoor pool
(which will be covered later) was financed by a $165,000
bond issue to be repaid with state cigarette-tax money that
reverts to cities and counties for recreation purposes (see
RECREATION, September 1956, Page 327). The old swim-
ming pool has been converted into an amphitheater and
picnic area complete with concrete tables and fireplaces.
Gallup also has two new tennis courts with four inches of
curbing to permit flooding for ice skating. The major prob-
lems besetting recreation in Gallup, according to Michael
E. \chissick. director of the recreation and parks depart-
ment, are "water systems, grass, and trees.” After having
experimented with Arizona ash and Carolina poplar as pos-
sible solutions to the tree problem, Mr. McKissick finds that
the poplars win. They are just “tremendous,” he says. For
1960 Gallup plans new playground equipment for Veterans
Park and grass seeding all around town. Gallup’s recrea-
tion commission has as its chairman Wayne Banks. admin-
istrative assistant at the \Vingate Ordnance Depot.

NEW" YORK. After much vociferous campaigning and
heated battle by fervent proponents and opponents, voters
approved the constitutional amendment authorizing the con-
troversal North way route through the state Adirondack For-
est Preserve. Since ]895 the state constitution had stipulated
that the Adirondack and Catskill forest preserves “shall be
kept forever as wild forest lands,” thus necessitating an
amendment (see RECREATION, January 1959, Page 31,). The
four-lane, concrete, tollfree expressway will cover 254 acres
of the 2,300,000-acre preserve and will run along the west
shore of Schroon Lake.

OREGON. The state has appointed its first director of
recreation, Clayton Anderson, formerly superintendent of
the \Villarnalane Park and Recreation: District.

An excellent example of joint planning, acquisition, and
development is the new five-hundred-aere metr0politan park
in Eugene, the joint effort of the park and recreation depart-
ment, Lane County, the University of Oregon, the Eugene
Water and Electric Board, and others. This centrally located
area will provide facilities for the entire metropolitan area
of Eugene and Springfield. The Tualatin: Hills Park and
Recreation District fBeaverton) has passed :1 3675.000 hond
. issue to provide for the acquisition: of several recreation
areas. five sets of two lighted tennis courts, four wading
peols, a lighted baseball field. an indoor-outdoor swimming
pool and one outdoor pool, which will cost $361,000.

SOUTH CAROLINA. Since Danny Jones. director of

the Cooper River Parks and Playground Commission. has
given so much of himself and his life to the cause of recrea-
tion, it was only fitting that the North Charleston area he
serves show its gratitude with a “Danny Jones Appreciation
Day.” during which it named a new swimming pool and ree-
reation center in his honor. Danny’s “day” was not limited
to North Charleston, but was also commemorated all over
the South where his influence has been felt down the years,
in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida.
In honor of the event, the state house of representatives
adopted a resolution citing “the dedicated attitude and life
of Danny Jones in helping to make the north area a wonder-
ful place to live and raise children." The Charleston News
and Courier said editorially: “Mr. Jones is a native of
Charleston who has been contributing ably to the future as
well as the present of the community.”

The Daniel H. Jones Swimming Pool and Recreation Cen-
ter (to be formal] cost $170,000 and includes three tennis
courts, a 165'-by-52' swimming pool, 42'-l)y-43' diving
well, and rlO'-by-52' wading pool, and patio area. The rec-
reation center is located on a fourteen-and-a-half-acre lot;
a large picnic area in a wooded area will be constructed
later. The above facilities were part of a $250,000 bond
issue of the Cooper River Commission, approved by North
Charleston citizens in 1958. Also constructed the same time
was another pool. 25 meters by 42 feet. a 32'-by-32' div-
ing well, a 20'-by-20' wading pool. plus bathhouse, to give

‘l

the area its first two public swimming pools. .3:

4‘ Of primary importance to those of
us working with the ill and handicapped
is the “Bill for Independent Living”
(H. R. 3465), presented to Congress
earlier this year and currently being
revised. The bill was introduced by
Congressman Carl Elliott of Alabama
and reads as follows: “To provide eval-
uation of rehabilitation potentials and
rehabilitation services to handicapped
individuals who, as a result thereof, can
achieve such ability of independent liv-
ing as to dispense with the need for
expensive institutional care or largely
dispense with the need of an attendant
at home; to assist in the establishment
of public and private nonprofit work-
shops and rehabilitation facilities; and
for other purposes.”

This bill takes the emphasis off the
physical and vocational aspects of re-
habilitation. If the bill becomes a law,
a great deal of government attention
will undoubtedly be given to the area
of rccreational therapy as a force in so-
cial rehabilitation.

Regional hearings are being held in
eight parts of the United States and at
each one of these meetings the National
Recreation Association has been askcd
to present what it feels are the unmet
needs of the chronically ill and handi-
capped individuals. I also represent the
Association as a member of a small com-
mittee. headed by Rep. Elliott, whose
function is to determine unmet needs
and in what way the government can
assist in meeting these needs.

4‘ In November, Elliott Cohen traveled

through the Northwest, giving a series
of workshops under the auspices of state
and community agencies and the Vetcr-
ans Administration. Next month, he
will have an intcresting report for you
about recreation for the ill and handi-
capped about them.

ation for the Ill and Handicapped has

done in eleven states in its nursing home
projects, the Division of the Aged,
United States Department of Public
Health, Washington, D. C., is working
closely with the Service to determine
the best method by which states can in-
clude recreation as a basic standard for
all nursing homes in all states. The end
result of this is probably a few years
off, but it actually means that not hun-
dreds, but thousands of positions, in
this field will open up. There are twenty-
five thousand nursing homes over the
country.

'i‘ The Consulting Service now has
fourteen on its staff and has just en-
gaged a research director. He is Dr.
Lawrence Podell, a professor in the so-
ciology department at thc College of the

More than sixty have been visited. The
next step is to study at least one half
dozen in depth and work out plans for
demonstration projects in thesc.

'i‘ The Consulting Service has sent let-
ters to sixteen hundrcd outstanding
community recreation executives asking
if they service the mentally or physi-
cally handicapped. Of the respondents,
246 serviced handicapped persons. Ap-
parently none of the 246 offered well-
rounded, yearly programs. On the
strength of this information, and with

Planning Recreation Facilities

Some 115 recreation and park executives and planners
attended the 1959 National Institute in Recreation Admin-
istration. held September 24-25, in Chicago. They repre-
sented all the National Recreation Association lield districts,
thirty-live states, and Canada. The delegates came from
small communities from coast to coast, with populations
from 5,000 to 10,000, and from such large cities and coun-
ties as Los Angeles City and County, California; Rullalo,
New York; Birmingham, Alabama; Louisville, Kentucky;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; and West-
chester County. New York.

Over ninety percent of thc delegates have bachelor‘s de-
grees and over forty-live percent have done graduate work.
Thirty-three percent had their master’s degrecs or better.
The age range was from twenty-three to sixty-four, with an
average of thirty-eight. Their experience ranged from one
to forty years, with an average of thirteen.

This pattern is similar to preceding Institutes, and each
year there has been a rather substantial waiting list. The
Institute quota has been established and is restricted to one
hundred executives, not including committee members. in-
structional staff, and consultants.

The administration building of the Chicago Park District,
where the 1959 Institute was held, is a beautiful four-story
structure overlooking Soldiers Field. The spacious lobby
was the scene of special planning exhibits prepared espe-
cially for the Institute by the Chicago Park District stall.
These included panel display boards with floral decorations,
showing artists’ drawings, photographs. plans, and designs
of various types of recreation facilities. In addition to these
splendid facilities, the Chicago Park District made available
their engineers, architects, landscape specialists, legal. and
liuaucial experts. Thesc pe0ple carefully prepared manu-
scripts and presented them to the Institute delegates.

The second day included workshop sessions in the morn-
ing and an instruction tour in the afternoon. Special tepies
included Orientation for Parks and Recreation Planning,
Comprehensive Planning for Parks and Recreation. Trends
in Space Standards, Landscape Design and Site Planning,
Architectural and Engineering Services, New Concepts in
the Design of Recreation Buildings, Legal Aspects of Park
and Recreation: Planning, Public Relations Aspects of Park
and Recreation Planning.

The national Institute is a highly concentrated two-day
program, built around a single vital subject, so that a lim-
itcd number of recreation cxeentives may deal with these
in depth and explore them thoroughly and comprehensively.
The Institute has been established because of an increas-
ingly expressed need, by a large number of executives.

THE 1959 NATIONAL INSTITUTE IN

Personnel

RECREATION ADMINISTRATION

Various themes aml subjects have been suggested by the
executives themselves and the Institutes to date have dealt
with the subjects requested by the largest number of execu-
tives. Those listed for the future are. subject to change de-
pending upon each year’s demand. Some now under con-
sideration include: Personnel Administration, Budget and
Finance, Leadership and lluman Relations, Visual Re-
sources, Ollice Management and Equipment.

 

Members of the committee that planned anrl conrlnctecl the
Fourth National Institute in Recreation Administration are,
from left to right, Franh Evans, Maplewoocl, NJ; William
Lederer, Creenburgh, N.Y..' Daniel 1.. Flaherty. Chicago
Park District; Al Culriershi, Garden City, .\'.l’.: W. C.
Sutherland; and John Dalenherg, Chicago Park District.
Tu‘o missing members: Sal I’rezioso, Westchester County,

N. Y., and '0. C. (Terry) Rose, Chicago Park District.

The Institute is planned and conducted by an Institute
Committee of the National Recreation Association's Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Recruitment, Training. and
Placement. It is held in conjunction with the National Rec-
reation Congress aud housed in the best facilities aiailable.
To date, Institutes have been held in hotel ballrooms. a mu-
uieipal center, a mayor's large conference room. and the last,
in the famous Administration Building of the Chicago Park
District.

As far as possible, outstanding specialists are engaged
both from outside and inside the recreation movement. For
instance, at the. Institute on Communications and Public
Relations, the faculty was drawn entirely from outside the
park and recreation lield. The instructors included top men
in this lield of specialization from General Motors, American
Telephone 8' Telegraph, the National Publicity Council. and
a private public relations firm.

lnstitute reports are available. depending upon the nature
of the Institute and the material developed by various in-
structors. The report of the Third National Institute is avail-
able iu book form under the title Communications and Public
Relations—[low to Make the Next of Them. If there is an
immediate demand for a report on the recent lnstitute deal-
ing with planning, a special publication will be considered.

The. popularity, to date, of the lnstitute—now in its lifth
year—indicates that recreation and park executives want to
keep up with new devcl0pmeuts and continue their prepara-
tion as the scope of administrative responsibilities increases.

Obviously, there is a need and a place for the Institute type

of training. #

Three for Winter

New indoor games and new variations of old ones are at
a premium during the cold winter months. Below follow
three variations or new versions of old standbys.

Almost exclusively an outdoor game up to the present,
hopscotch can now come indoors, thanks to Hopscotch,
lnc., which has introduced a heavy-gauge vinyl panel,
seven feet long and thirty-three inches wide. with the game
markings imprinted thereon. Skid-resistant. the vinyl can
be placed on any floor just about anywhere, including out-
doors, where pavements may not be marked up. A set of
colored. nontoxic plastic discs is included with the panel.
For complete details, write Hopscotch. Inc., 101 Park Ave-
nue. New York 17.

Feeling strongly that the
game of jacks was suffering
from lack of rules. standard-
ization of ball size. and too
many variations. Leo Milan
developed Mat Jacks after sev-
eral years’ experience in phy-
sical education and recreation.
The mat performs the follow-
ing functions: I) encloses the
playing area; 2l keeps partici-
pants off rough, unclean sur-
faces: 3) ensures a true-even
ball bounce; 4) allows players
to pick up jacks easily Imat does not wrinkle) : 5} permits
players to kneel or sit on the same surface while playing.
The center circle is 26" in diameter, thc smaller outer cir-
eles are three inches. printed on the mat, which can be
easily folded for storage. Outlined in the rule hook accom-
panying the game are rules for regular jacks, recreation
arithmetic games, and rules and regulations for advanced
player competition. A pocket on the mat itself contains the
rule hook. hall and jacks, pencil and score pad. For de-
tailed information. write Recreational Facilities Corpora-
tion. 1222 Ogdcn Street, Denver. Colorado.

A new athletic device called -
Jump Ball has been devised to de-
velop a basketball player’s ahility
in jumping and grabbing re-
bounds. improve his timing and
coordination during action in the
air. and strengthen his forearms,
wrists, and hands. Though a bas-
ketball device, its uses don’t have
to be entirely limited to improving
that game. but could be an all-
round physical fitness improver.
Jump Ball is a baskethall-like
sphere suspended overhead from a
special response arm. Height of -
the ball is easily adjusted by coach or trainer just within
the player's jumping reach. A special hydraulic-spring

hearts of adults and children in the

themselves in difl'erent ways in difl'crent
lands, and perhaps you’ll want to make
recognition of this, in some way, in
your own Christmas program.

If you do, you’ll want to refer to this
book, so carefully prepared through
endless research. It is delightful read-
ing and even if you don’t use it in your
season’s festivities, you’ll want to give
it to some young person who is enchant-
ed with this season or to some recrea-
tion student or program leader. Its few
illustrations add little but with its color-
ful “word pictures,” it manages very
well.

This book has had an interesting his-
tory. It was prepared originally as a
master’s thesis for Chicago University,
in 1915, printed in 1916 by the state
when lndiana celebrated its centennial,
went out of print in 1918. was reprinted
by the State Historical Bureau in 1938,
and went out of print again in 194-8,
after which time it became a collector’s
item.

As a study of recreation life in our
country more than a century ago, it
gives a lively and fascinating picture of
' life before automobiles,
ard-su rfacetl roads, and more sophisti-
cated tastes changed its pattern. Those
'nterestcd in singing and play-party
mcs will find fascinating variations
of old favorites, both circle and line
variations, as well as comments on their
istoric background.

Covering the Leisure-time Field

the recreation leader will find this book
a well-written, fascinating bit of Amer-
icana.

The profession lost a potentially very
important historian and commentator
when the author died at twenty-six in

1918.

Creotive Discussion, Rupert Cortright
and George l. Hinds. The Mocmillon
Compony, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York.
Pp. 303. $6.00.

This is a very interesting book deal-
ing with all types of discussion situa-
tions. The authors stress the need to
participate creatively in all discussion
situations, highlighting the concepts
and techniques that aid in realizing this
ann.

The more common errors of speech
making are covered, with an emphasis
on how a speaker can achieve creative
precision in meaning and how the
listener can participate to make a speech
more successful. In an era when in-
creasing complexity and specialization
have placed increasing importance 0n
communication and discussion, this
book could be a very valuable assist to
all kinds of pe0ple, including recreation
executives and supervisors. —W. C.
Sutherland. Director, NRA Recreation
Personnel Service.

Blueprint for Teen-Age Living, Wil-
liom C. Menninger, M.D. et ol. Sterling
Publishing, 4l9 Fourth Avenue, New
York 16. Pp. 224. $2.95.

This cxcel’ent book to help tecn-agers
with ‘the difficu't business of growing
up, by one of the famous Menninger
brothers of the Manningcr Foundation
in Topeka, Kansas, can be of great ben-
efit for adult readers as well. Do you,
for instance, know what it is to grow
up emotionally? Are you mature or
one of those pc0plc who will remain
forever ado'esccnt? Interesting, and
not too widely known, facts about a'co-
hol and narcotics are included. This
is a good source book for groups of
teen-agers and their leaders, should lead
to some rewarding discussions.

Chonglng Concepts and Proctices l-n
Psychiotric chpotionol ThempY. Wil-
mo 1. West, MW, OTR, Editor. Amerl-
con Occupational Therapy Association,
250 West 57th Street, New York l9.
Pp. 248. $l.50.

Five years ago, the American Occu-
pational Therapy Association received
a grant from the National Institute for
Mental llca'th to conduct a study to
“maximize the educational and clinical
contributions of occupational therapy
to the total treatment program for psy-
chiatric patients.” This study has since
become known as the Allcnherry Con-
fercnce. The present volume is a de~
tailed account of findings, including a
review of psychiatric treatment tech-
niques, functions of occupational thera-
py in psychiatry and their preparation.

Of interest to recreation personnel is
the section on “Use of Activities.”
Of the fifty-three hospita's mentioned,
which have recreation programs. t'vclve
are administered by an occupational
therapy department. seventeen are inde-
pendent recreation departments. three
are jointly administered, and twelve
are part of rehabilitation departments.
Ten hosnitals feel occupational therapy
should be responsible for recreation,
eighteen sugecst autonomy, twenty-live

feel it should be in a coordinated or
combined structure.

The book offers considerable infor-
mation on the use of self as a therapeu-
tic tool. group dynamics. and the crea-
tion of a therapeutic milieu. It covers
future trends in psychiatric occupa-
tional therapy, including plans for
strengthening educational preparation.
A'l recreation personnel in psychiatric
hospitals should read this volume, as
it will undoubtcd'y be used for a con-
siderable time as a standard reference.

Recreotion in Total Rehobilitotion, J.
l. Rothbone, PhD, ond Corol C. lucos,
EdD. Chorles C. Thomas, 301 East low-

rence Avenue, Springfield, Illinois. Pp.
398. $9.00.

This long-awaited, comprehensive
treatise, by two well-known leaders, is
the first real attempt to provide a text
for the field of rehabilitative recreation.
The book is divided into three sections:
Chapters One through Three deal with
the philosophy of recreation for the ill
and handicapped. Chapters Four to
Eight concern medical indications and
limitations for various patients in recre-
ation activities. Chapters Nine through
Sixteen discuss the various activity me-
dia and describe thousands of useful ac-
tivitics in detail. A book like this is a
must for all personnel.

(Continued from preceding page)

Psychiatric Architecture, Charles E.
Goshen, MD, Editor. American Psychi-
atric Association, 1700 18th Street,
N. W., Washington, D. C. Pp. 156.
$10.50.

In recent years it has become appar-
ent that specialized facilities are neces-
sary in the treatment of psychiatric pa-
tients, and must lend themselves to the
treatment of the patient. Psychiatric
Architecture is a comprehensive report
of an American Psychiatric Association
study project begun in 1952.

Throughout the book are references
to recreation activity areas. Consider-
able space is devoted to recreation fa-
cilities and profuse illustrations cover
both outdoor and indoor areas, includ-
ing hospital facilities in Europe and
Asia. A fine section deals with the his-
torical aspect of the subject, and {I won-
derful section with current concepts in
treatment. Recreation personnel will
not be surprised that a great portion of
the book concerns recreation and its
role with patients.

Rehabilitation Center Planning, F. C.
Salmon, AIA and C. F. Salmon, AIA.
Pennsylvania State University Press,
University Park, Pennsylvania. Pp. 164
(plus 26-page supplement). $12.50.

The authors are architects who have
joined their knowledge and talents with
those of a distinguished group of in-
dividuals in the rehabilitation field to
produce this long-needed book. Its
pages are crammed with practical draw-
ings, designs, and diagrams for plan-
ning rehabilitation facilities, children’s
playrooms, and adult activity areas.
Consideration is given esthetic aspects
of center buildings, even to a discussion
of music and art as they affect patient
attitudes. \Vith thoughtful application,

much of the material here is applicable
not only to rehabilitation centers but
also to other institutions servicing the

ill and handicapped.

Teachers’ Dance Handbook (No. 7-
Kindergarten to Sixth Year) , Olga Kul-
bitsky and Frank Kaltman. Folkraft,
1159 Broad Street, Newark 2, New
Jersey. Pp. 342, illustrated. $6.50.

How many times have you wished for
a book on how to teach dancing. based
on a natural progression of physical
skills and the child’s interests and ex-
periences? When a book does this and,
at the same time, provides an integrated
folk-dance program, presented with
clarity and economy of words, tune and
action for each dance clearly given, it
is a real find.

If you have wanted to give your
dance program continuity, instead of
letting it be a haphazard, off-and on af-
fair, this book is the answer. It has al-
ready been accepted as a text by some
three hundred teachers colleges, an in-
(lication of its sound teaching tech-
niques. It covers, progressively, the
simplest song plays and rhythms, fol-
lowed by play-party games, folk dances,
squares, contras. and mixers— from
simple individual movement to the
more complicated steps with partners
and group action. Every effort has been
made to keep the ethnic quality of the
dances intact and authentic.

Many readers will remember with
pleasure the dance sessions led by Miss
Kulbitsky and Mr. Kaltman at National
Recreation Congresses, and articles
they have prepared for RECREATION.
Miss Kulbitsky is head of the dance di-
vision of the physical education de-
partment at Hunter College. New York
City, and a memher of the NRA Dance
Committee. Mr. Kaltman is a lecturer
and dance consultant, and producer of
Folkraft records.

 

The Reason for the Pelican, John Ci-
ardi. J. B. Lippincott, East Washington
Square, Philadelphia. Pp. 64. $3.00.

There is imaginative freedom and
space for fun between the covers of this
slim volume of poetry for children.
Nothing is closed up or tightened
against pure enjoyment. Readers of all
ages will find favorites among Mr. Ci-
ardi’s versified inventions. Among our
own are: “Rain Sizes,” “Prattle,” “How
to Tell the Top of a Hill,” and “The
Principal Parts of a Python.”

It would be more diiiicu‘t to pick
and choose from the weaTth of pictorial
interpretation Madeleine Gekiere has
given these verses. The lyricism in her
sensitive line drawings and their just-
right balance on each page hring magic
to our encounters with a Three-Toed
Glecp, a Saginsack, or a Brobinyak.
Sharing these pictures with children and
reading the verses aloud should evoke
a response of eyes and ears keyed to
tiahtroDe tautness.——Eiizabeth Cuibert.
librarian, National Recreation Associa-
tron.

In case you care . . .

o The first performance of a flea
circus took place in 1846 under
the august sponsorship of King
Louis Philippe of France.

HELP US KEEP THE
THINGS WORTH KEEPING

Here’s what peace is all
about. A world where busy
little girls like this can stand,
happily absorbed in"paint-
ing a bright picture that
mother can hang in the kitch-
en and daddy admire when
he gets home from work.

A simple thing, peace. And
a precious one. But peace is
not easy to keep, in this
troubled world. Peace costs
money.

Money for strength to keep
the peace. Money for science
and education to help make
peace lasting. And money

saved by individuals to keep
our economy sound.

Every U.S. Savings Bond
you buy helps provide money
for America’s Peace Power—
the power that helps us keep
the things worth keeping.

Are you buying as many
as you might?

AMERICA” S
