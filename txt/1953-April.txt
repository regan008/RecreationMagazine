RECREATION

Recreation and the Church

Paul Moore, Jr.

The work of the Church is to heal and to bring people to God. The Christian
must use all the resources at his command to effect these ends, for it is the whole
person who must be made whole and the total personality which must be brought
to a total relationship with God.

In the terminology of the Church, the first step in healing is repentance and
forgiveness of sins; only after the guilt is washed away, the barriers with others
and with self removed, and commerce with God resumed, may the sick mind-

 

body renew its growth. This process is often unconscious and might be phrased
differently if described by a psychiatrist or social worker; be that as it may, this
is redemptive activity. On all levels of the life of a parish the redemptive activity is alive. The priest vis-
its the sick, counsels the confused, gives absolution to the penitent, but above all helps to build a com-
munity which will have a redemptive vitality for all who enter it. Recreation is of the essence of such
a community. A boy full of hostility because of the social conditions in which he lives comes to the
church. Here he is accepted as a person. He joins in the recreation provided and, in the physical activ-
ity of boxing or basketball, works off his hostility. He begins to again enter into constructive relation-
ship with those around him. The barriers are broken, a cause for sin is partly removed, the work of
creation in God’s continual building of our lives again resumes itself. The parish house is an instru-
ment of healing.

Let us look even more deeply into the meaning of Christian recreation. The whole spirit of joy which
must characterize a true Christian community has recreation as one of its causes as well as one of its
means of articulation. It is a spirit of affirmation, of freedom, of happiness, which issues forth from
absolute faith. There is listening to music, casual conversation, handshaking, laughter, movement,
noise, quiet, lending of things, working together, leaning on others, holding up of others, and again
laughter. This is the recreative activity of love and it may even issue forth from pain. Whenever
someone touches it, takes part in it, he begins to be made again, to be recreated, to be healed.

The role of recreation in evangelism is more obvious but nonetheless important. Often there are chil-
dren or even adults for whom there must be a step between the initial meeting with a member of the
parish or the clergyman and their coming to church. A lively recreation program fills this need. Often
a child does not remember what he learns in Sunday School; but if he remembers that the church is a
place where he is loved and where he has a happy time, he is more likely to have a favorable view of
religion as he grows up—and even if he does fall away from the life of the church in his adolescence
and early manhood, he may through marriage be drawn back again to the place he loved so well when
he was last a member of a domestic family situation. Once a person has become a church member he
has not finished his growing, rather he has just begun to grow in the Christian life, he has just started
the long journey to the Center of Reality, the Heavenly Father. For this reason, the Church is forever
teaching, formally and informally, about the nature of God and the way to Him. Good recreation can
teach us much about the nature of God. As one of our sem-
inary professors once said, “God has a wonderful time
just being God.”

Recreation finds its place in the religious life of the
world of today, as it finds itself in all aspects of a full and
human existence.

.13., first vice-president of Na-

tional Recreation Associa-
tion, is the pastor of Grace

Church in Jersey City.

Church Recreation

Sirs:

I have always enjoyed RECREATION,
but I think I liked the articles of Bishop
Bayne and Dr. Anderson, in the De-
cember 1952 issue, more than any
others I have previously read. I wish
I could have been at the Congress and
heard those addresses.

You see—here at Highland we be-
lieve in recreation as a very necessary
part of the religious education program
of the church. We have a recreation
building which contains a large base-
ment game room in which we play
ping-pong, billiards, cue roque, shuf-
fleboard and other games; and we hOpe
soon to have two bowling alleys down
there. On the main floor, we have a
recreation hall big enough for roller
skating and square dancing. This large
room is also equipped with a very
complete stage for dramatic produc-
tions and pageants. We show movies
here, too. Then there is a third floor
room, which is really a sort of mez-
zanine to the recreation hall, in which
we will soon have small table games,
checkers, chess, and a TV set.

We are one of the all-too-few church-
es that go in for recreation on such a
large scale. I am enclosing a schedule
of our fall and winter program. In ad-
dition to the listed activities we have
a basketball team entered in the local
church league—and will have a midget
basehall team next summer.

VERNON W. JOHNSON, Director of

Recreation, Highland Presbyterian

Church, F ayetteville, North Carolina.

Sirs:

In the past two years RECREATION
magazine and many of the publications
of the National Recreation Association
have heen an enormous aid in my
work as a recreation director at Saint
Joseph’s Villa, a home for underpriv-
ile'ged children. During the summer
months I am employed on a full time
basis at the Villa, and throughout the
year, when my schoolwork allows, I
serve on a voluntary basis. The me-
dium of recreation in all forms plays
an important part here in the readjust-

ing of neglected children. When I
started, I knew very little in the held
of recreation; but your magazine and
many pamphlets have brought me a
long way. Each time, though, when I
finish reading RECREATION, I realize
how little I know and how much I
have to learn. I could not possibly
have got along without it.

The main purpose of my letter is to
inquire about an active associate mem-
bership in your organization and more
about the many services you offer.
While my life is to be spent in the
priesthood, I believe that recreation
plays a great role even in religion.

WILLIAM J. FLYNN, Saint Andrews

Seminary, Rochester, New York.

Sports for Juniors
Sirs:

May‘I take this opportunity to ex-
press appreciation for the timely and
scholarly report of the Committee on
Highly Organized Competitive Sports
and Athletics for Boys Under Twelve,
recently released hy National Recrea-
tion Association.

Mr. Mathewson and his entire com-
mittee are to be congratulated. At a
time when communities and recreation
departments are being sought by vari-
ous pressure groups and enthusiasts,
each having a different theory or ac-
tivity to promote, it is of great value
to have at hand the very sound interim
principles set forth by the committee
and to know that the basic principles
of sound recreation are receiving en-
dorsements by such a representative
group.

pervisor, Oakland Recreation De-

December 1952 Issue

Sirs:

Congratulations on the December is-
sue of RECREATION. It’s the best yet.
We especially like the “Notes for the
Administrator” and “People and

Events.” “I Am a Professional Recrea-
tion Leader,” by Lillian Schwertz, and

RECREATION

“Recreation in America Today,” by

Mr. Prendergast, are most inspiring.
HENRY T. SWAN, Superintendent of
Recreation, Phoenix, Arizona.

Panicizing the Year’s Activities

Sirs:

Following up your note about our
page of newspaper advertising, in “Are
You Progressive?” on page 546 of the
February 1953 issue of RECREATION, I
should like to give you further details.
First off, we put one out each school
year and each vacation period. It
comes out as a full page in a Sunday
paper the third Saturday in May for
the vacation period and the last Sun-
day of the summer vacation for the
school year period.

The merchants and professional
people listed on the bottom of the page
pay for the ad. After it has appeared
in the paper we ohtain one hundred
c0pies to distribute to the schools,

churches and public hulletin boards in -

the lihrary, the public health office, the
American Legion, Court House, Cham-
ber of Commerce office.

Everybody benefits. The newspaper
gets the ad, orders for the printing of
our one hundrcd copies, and a good
public response. The merchants get
their ad in the Sunday paper, their
names scattered all over town for many
months—associated with the recreation
program. The people not only receive
the information regarding the program
hut also the feeling that here are fifty
of the leading business men in town
in full support of the recreation pro-
gram. The recreation commission has
the warm feeling of the newspaper, the
many merchants, and the associated
services whom we include on our chart.

As you can see we have used psy-
chology, public relations or just horse-
sense in the wording of the chart. We
recognize the good in commercial rec-
reation and so advertise it. We recog-
nize the excellent service to public rec-
reation which the puhlic lihrary gives,
and we say so. We recognize the im-
mense value of the school, the church
and the home and so put them in a
prominent spot.

The whole thing costs us, in money,
only for the printing of the one hun-
:lred copies~and that is cheap hecause
the type is already set up for the ad.

The poster being displayed in so
nany places in the community keeps
:itizens aware that our services are
lvailahle. The fact that we mention the
Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the 4-H
:lubs, the library and all of the events
:ponsored by the service clubs makes
)ur poster valuable.

We really don’t attempt to outline

)ur program in detail because it, like ‘

\PRIL 1953

father-son and mother-daughter dou-

should be stressed which use materials
normally found in the home or in that
particular locality and always impress
on the child the importance of sharing

to almost every activity of a recrea-
tion department. . . . a

there is almost no limit to what you
could do in guiding family recreation.

Last September when I came to work

elor, superintendent of the Coachella
Valley Recreation, Park and Parkway
District, I had only the faintest idea of
what recreation meant. Since then, I
have become interested to the extent

I agree with the statement that “we : Add'“ 2°“

forgotten how to play and claim such

One point that is frequently over-
looked is that in our present civiliza-
tion, we have become so well organ-
ized that it is usually quite true that
we have little time for “play.” Home
life has suffered to the extent that
mother is off here, father off there and
the children somewhere else.

I firmly believe that whether the ac-
tivity be organized recreation, church,
school or social that it should only
supplement, not take the place of, home
life. I feel that activities which can be
taken home and enjoyed hy the whole
family should be stressed. When you

) TIIE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES will address the annual meet-

ing and leadership mobilization of the

board of directors of the United De-
fense Fund, to be held at the Hotel
Statler in Washington, on April sev-
enth. The National Recreation Asso-
ciation is one of the participating agen-
cies in the UDF, and will be repre-
sented at this meeting by Joseph Pren-
dergast, Executive Director, and Ar-
thur Williams, Assistant Executive Di-
rector for Defense Related Activities
for the association.

) THE NEED FOR RECREATION DEPART-
MENTS TO WEIGH CAREFULLY the liabil-
ity factor in every operation, is illus-
trated once again by a case, last sum-
mer, of drowning at a municipally
owned swimming area. The victim was
a child of seven. The beach was su-
pervised and no negligence has been
proven, but the child’s parents have
brought suit against the city. The local
recreation commission also has been
called to task on the question of the
safety of its other recreation facilities—
broken swings, broken baseball and
softball backstops, and so on. Spring is
a good time for thorough, over_-all
checking, in preparation for your sum-
mer activities! Are there additional
safety measures which you. should take
under consideration?

) EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, the Controlled
Materials Plan (C 14P) under which
the National Production Authority has
limited recreation will end, according
to an announcement by Arthur S.
Fleming, acting director of the Office
of Defense Administration. Until then
recreation construction will be con-
trolled by a directive issued December
10, 1952. Under this directive recrea-

tion departments may self-authorize the

ney. Ten different communities in this
critical defense area will share the cost
of bringing to the area, Helen Daun-
cey, NRA program specialist and Kath-
erine F. Barker Memorial Secretary.

) ENROLLMENT IN ADULT EDUCATION,
under public school auSpices, has taken
a sharp leap forward, according to a
study financed by the Ford Foundation.
Enrollments in adult education classes,

in town and city school systems,'have
risen to nearly 5,000,000, as compared

with 1,750,000 in 1948.

) POSSIBILITIES OF SECURING RELIEF
FROM ADMISSION TAXES in the new tax
bill which may be enacted during this
session of Congress, are being explored
by the National Recreation Association
with treasury officials and members of
the new Congress. In planning a spe-
cific proposal to be submitted to Con-
gress for its consideration a question-
naire was sent to recreation and park
executives by Joseph Prendergast, the
executive director of the association.

a new high during the year ending
June 30, 1952 with the record sale of
17,127,896 anglers’ licenses, according
to a report supplied to the Sport Fish-

Six Player
Softball

0 Official softball rules are used with the following ex-
ceptions:

Players: There shall be only six players all of whom are
infielders including pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second
baseman, third baseman and short stop (no outfielders).
Size of Diamond: For all junior girls, midget boys and
girls, the diamond shall be 45 feet but for junior boys,
senior boys and girls, the diamond shall be 55 feet.

Side Retired: When all six batsmen have batted, the side
will be declared retired regardless of the number.of outs.
Likewise, three outs will retire a side. However, if the
sixth batter does not make the third out, any runs scored

during his time at bat and until the play on him has been
completed, shall count.

Balls and Strikes: All balls and strikes will be called as
usual.

Batted Balls: Any ball which goes past the infield shall en-
title the batsman to only one base and all runners advance
at own risk. However, on an infield hit the batsman may
advance as many bases as he can make. An outfield hit
will entitle the batsman to only one base. If in the judg-
ment of the umpire the infielder has made an error, the
batsman can advance only as far as third base at his own
risk and in all cases the runner will advance at his own
risk. The sixth or last batsman may be put out in the
usual manner or may hit, but pitcher may not walk him.
Caught Fly: Any caught fly, infield or outfield, fair or
foul, the batsman will be out. "

Stealing: Runners may steal only one base at a time. The
runner may advance only one base on any overthrow at
any base. No stealing home will be allowed and players,
therefore, may be either hit in or played on at third to
score.

Last Inning: If in the first half of the last inning the team
at bat (visiting team) has a seven run lead over the home
team, the game is over and the home team does not take its
time at bat.

\Vhat’s a community without stores? These mothers are look-
ing for bargains. There’s much one can learn in a village.

SMITH MEMORIAL PLAYGROUNDS VILLAGE might be de-

scribed as a village that isn’t there. Of course, the
person who did describe it that way would be wrong, but
ten minutes after Village is over for thc day, therc is no
sign of it except for a couple of large empty rooms and a
storage closet bulging with folding plywood houses, bank
and postollice, store counters, furnishings and quite an
assortment of miscellaneous goods. These include cuts of
meat in wood, very red and white and mouth-watering,
though costly, inilk bottles with the milk and cream firmly
painted in and completely spill-proof. Included, too, are
objccts of art, and everything that comes in betwecn—all
creations of the villagers.

As a matter of fact, Village is only set up twice a week
for an hour and a half period, but that isn’t all there is to
it. It begins with children playing house together.

The first village started when a little girl at our North-
crn Liberties Playground took some bricks that were left
over from a repair job and built a wall to make herself
“a house.” Then she gathered together several children
small enough to be docile, bccause every home has to have
childrcn. She was, of course, the mother.

But this was a very destitute family—they had literally
nothing. You can’t have a community without stores. A
couple of the boys thought they might start some, there-

al Playgrounds and Playhouses, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

As conducted by the

Smith Memorial Playgrounds
of Philadelphia, this
imaginative program has
endured for some thirty years
and has spread to other
playgrounds. Why not try

one of your own?

fore, because they knew how it should be done and “Girls
are so dumb.”

At this point a couple more families ‘wanted to get into
the act, and you couldn’t tell which was the more insistent
-——the little mothers’ demands for a school so their children
wouldn’t be always tagging around after them, or the boys’
bowls for things to sell in their stores. A school, industries,
bank, hospital, civic government, including police and
street cleaning departments, postoHice, restaurant, laundry,
theater, and so on followed along as quickly as they could
be established in answer to the demands of the citizens, and
in answer to the desire of the many children to find sornc—
thing they could do in Village. Boys, girls, small or small-
er, leading citizens or drifters—we have them all in real
lifc, so we have them all in Village life.

We would like to make this point here, hOWever: Village

is not a replica of current adult life in the city in which
the children live. They borrow ideas from this but they
select and discard and try to think up better solutions.
They fail a lot of the time, and then they try something
else.

So the village was started by the children, but ,don’t
think for a moment that the Smith Memorial Playgrounds
intends to act modest for that reason. We feel that we
played a more important part for the very reason that we
did operate from the side-lines. We did not intrude the
adult point of view, but had rather restrained ourselves
and devoted our efforts to creating situations in which the
children could work out their own ideas and build their
own town.

That is, we wanted them to be on their own, within lim-
its. We wanted them to do the thinking; but we wanted
them to end up eventually with sound practices. To illus-
trate, the village hospital is so p0pu1ar and so realistic that
it must be a place for learning good practice in first aid,
baby care, dietetics. Under these circumstances, a certain
amount of information must be supplied by the staff of
play leaders.

All activity in our village involves a learning and grow-
ing process, and we won’t pretend that the play leaders do
not view it as a teaching job. However, our thriving vil-
lage has endured through thirty years, and spread to the
other playgrounds of the system.

The spark that was struck that first afternoon by a thir-
teen—year-old girl was a very small one, and it has taken
much thought and continual nurturing to get it burning
with a bright light, and to keep it burning steadily through
the years. Credit for this goes to Mrs. Phoebe Hall Valen-
tine, former executive director.

An average day in Village goes something like this: A
girl nine to eleven years of age enters in the role of mother.
She stops at the desk where she is registered for her home.
If she comes regularly, she may have the same home week
after week. If she comes occasionally, or arrives late, a.
home will be assigned to her. She either rents or buys her
home (with play money, of course). Buying it means that
it is hers for the current play season.

Generally “mothers” arrive with their “children” in tow.
They are their younger brothers and sisters, or neighbors’
children. Right now, at one of our centers, the mothers
come in alone and are permitted to pick out their children
from those in the kindergarten group. This is a very easy
and neat arrangement but it lacks some of the reality that
attaches to seeing the family groups trudging earnestly
toward Village.

However, this method is much better for the small chil-
dren as they are continually under the protective super-
vision of the regular kindergarten teachers, and are
brought to the kindergarten and dismissed from there in

the usual way.

We mention this because it shows immediately that how
the details of a village are worked out has to depend upon
the circumstances, and things are not done just the same
at any two of our centers. Nor is what we do today what
we may be doing next year.

ity. Soon the pupils will run home for a make-believe lunch.

lt is important to realize this because, if you try to push
the village into a set pattern, which isn’t a natural one, it
surely isn’t going to thrive. Many people try to pin us
down as to exactly what we do about various details. We
mean it when we say we don’t know. We would have to
live through the situation with the children involved, be-
fore we could come up with the answer.

And we won’t come up with the answer at all unless we
are continually analyzing things in our minds and talking
them over together. We accept the mothers taking their
children from the kindergarten group just now, but wc
are aware that the thing is starting off with a more arti-
ficial look and feel. We are watching to see whether the
children’s imaginations can bridge this gap, and they can
throw themselves into this make-believe life with the seri-
ousness which marks children’s play when it is spontane-
ous.

The mothers are easily identified as they take up resi-
dence in their homes because they wear long skirts—full
cotton affairs slipped on over their dresses. The homes have
reached the point of development where they have plywood
fronts and sides. They have a door and windows, usually
with curtains, and are furnished with table and chairs.

Everything else must be purchased by the mother at the
stores, so the first thing for her to do is to go to the bank
and get her allowance. Each mother has $6.00 for a Vil-
lage day. If she is prudent and is a regular resident, she
will have a savings account, from which she may draw or
not as she wishes.

She will have to do a little budgeting because, from the
$6.00 she receives, she must, in addition to furnishing her
home, pay the rent, buy food, pay hospital charges if she
takes thc children there, pay for entertainment if the family
indulges in this, perhaps buy something to satisfy their de-
sire for beauty, or save for the future if she decides that is
better. Entertaining is something she may want to do, and

RECREATION

she must allow for this.

The mother does not have the children with her all day;
they go to school when the school bell rings. They come
home for a make-believe lunch, however; and with shop-
ping and gossiping to be attended to and maybe a sick
(1011 to be taken to the baby clinic, she is kept busy getting
the house in order and lunch ready in time for the chil-
dren’s return from school.

Storcs and school appeared at almost the same time in
our first village. Stores are the most essential thing after
homes—stores and the industries that supply them with

merchandise. Industries, in the case of Village, are craft

and carpentry groups making such articles as cuts of meat,
'vegetables and fruit, papier-maché dishes, decorated paper
plates, household items such as table covers and napkins,
pictures for the wall, vases and artificial flowers, furniture,
and postcards, stamps and other postoilice material.

The stores vary from the old Main Street type to the
modern supermarket. There are an average of about seven
stores—the meat market, grocery store, dairy, fruit and
gift shop, dry-goods store, hardware store and toy shop.

Then, in a village that has reached any degree of organi-
zation, there is the warehouse. From here all goods are
supplied to storekeepers at the beginning of each Village
(lay. Storekeepers of course pay wholesale prices, upon
which they base the retail prices. The latter must, however,
be related to the amount the mothers have to spend, and
so there is a little two-way pulling, but, after all, that’s
business.

There are at least two workers in each store and four
in the warehouse; and they must be in their stores in suf-
ficient time to have received their stock from the warehouse
and have their stores set up and ready when Village opens.

The storekeeper has to pay rent; or he may buy his
store. He must also pay a village tax and the salary of his
helper; and, of course, he pays for his merchandise. Profits
are deposited to the store account in the bank.

The bank is vital to Village life. It not only serves the
merchants; but, as we have said, it is the place where the
mothers get their allotment each day. So, you see, this is
a special kind of bank—something greatly needed in real
life.

The bank also serves as paymaster for the village govern-
ment, diSpcrsing wages to employees after a payroll has
been submitted by the mayor. During the war, they sold
savings bonds at the bank.

As if they didn’t already have enough ideas, we make
things a little more hectic by taking the bankers each sea-
son to visit the trust company that is trustee for the Smith
Estate. The children always come home from this trip a
little more all agog than they were before. No wonder that
the bank has always been a most going affair in our vil-
lages. The banker’s job is one of the most responsible.

The mayor may be important, or he may be something
of a figurehead. He is an elected official, and who can tell
whether a political campaign will end in a wise choice or
not? Some campaigns get so hot that having them over
seems a sufficient blessing. Incidentally, the mayor is fre-
quently a girl, and this is, of course, owing to the simple

' APRIL 1953

fact that there are more female voters than male. Still, you
can’t tell—if there is a really engaging boy candidate,
maybe the girls turn out to be not too strong feminists after
all.

The mayor does have considerable responsibility, for he
collects the rents and taxes and has the supervision of the
whole civic department, including the street cleaners and
police. At times, and in some of our villages, the safcty
department has been very active, and there has been a busy
police chief. At other times there have been very few
V.S.P.’s (Village Safety Patrol), and the mayor has had
direct supervision of them.

The mayor is also the key figure in the Village Council,
where problems are discussed and decisions made. The
council determines the rate of pay for civic employees, and
might be called the brain of Village. Here the thinking is
done, or not done.

The Town Meeting, with which some of the villages end,
is another place where you have thought and discussion,

and where ideas and wishes of the villagers are expressed.
This is very stimulating, and puts the council on the spot;
but decision still rests with the council.

In one center the village ends with a radio broadcast
from the Village Radio Station. There is a program of en-
tertainment and the mayor and others have an opportunity
to make announcements. This does bind the total village
together, but of course the villagers don’t have a chance
to answer back as in the Town Meeting.

Just prior to this assembly, whatever form it takes, there

is a signal which means that mothers are to collect all the
articles in their homes and return them to the proper stores,
and deposit at the bank any money they have left over.
The storekeepers must see that the things brought in by
the mothers get into the proper boxes and are returned to
the warehouse. They too must make their deposits at the
bank.

We have described the essential village groups but there
are many others that are possible, such as a restaurant,

bank for a village day, and may maintain a savings account.

museum, library, laundry, theater, planetarium, news-
paper; and we always have some, if not all, of these in
operation.

Another very important factor is the preparation work
done by the various groups or departmcnts at times other
than during the periods when Villagc is set up. Mothers,
tcachers, nurses, storekeepcrs, meet at least once prior to
cvery villagc scssion, and the amount of craft and carpen-
try work that is done, the rehearsals that are held, and so
on, is limited by nothing but the children’s interest and the
ability of the center director to schedulc these groups.

At Martin School Recreation Center we are right now
cxperimenting with a permanent village set-up. We had,
for the first time, sufficient available space, and this was
something that had always been longed for as the ultimate
in desirability. However, when it camc to the point where
it was actually possible, the staff expressed themselves as
sceing both advantages and disadvantages. Thcy wanted
definitely to try this out, but with the idea that they were
only committed to it for a limited time, until they could

14-

see how the gains stacked up against the losses.

Village is always in the process of changing. It moves in
cycles, and every once in a while it happens that a group
of children who have been the most imaginative, and have
been leaders in this play activity, suddenly outgrow it at
the same time, or possibly they move away, and then the
village has to find new leaders. Perhaps it happens that the
average age is lower for one reason or another. Perhaps
there isn’t anyone who is as civic minded or as much of
a natural leader. It is hard sometimes to know exactly
why, but some of the more highly organized village services
and departments that were going strong the previous winter
just don’t appear when the activity opens in the fall. Later
on they will undoubtedly come hack, but they can’t be'
forced if Village is to be Village.

When we think of what children get out of Village, we
realize that, first of all, it has the advantage of having in it
a place for children of all ages, of all types and degrees of
ability. It gives them new experience and adventure in
play situations that are rcal enough to be satisfying.

It gives them the joy of creating and of self-expression, a
chance to use their imaginations, to “play pretend,” and
above all, the opportunity to exercise choice freely and
really.

Also, there comes to them, through experience, the reali-
zation that one’s behavior must be such that it does not
infringe upon the rights of others. And then slowly comes
also, we hope, the happy knowledge that this need not be a
frustration, but that cooperation is a rewarding experience
to the individual as well as one of benefit to the group.

gram, has announced to the Pennsylvania Recreation
Society his willingness to help other nearhy communi-

I ties establish children’s villages. ,

Money Blakers

Ways in which money can be made on the playground,
for the purchasc of new equipment, are suggested by
Margie Maconey of Columbia, Missouri:

Hold a carnival at the end of thc season and charge a
small fee for entrance to activities such as playlets, amateur
talent shows, a miniature golf course (made by the chil-
dren). ,

An exccllent puppet show theatre can be conistructcd
from‘an clcctric icehox packing case, with a window (for
stage) cut in the front and a door at the back. A play-
ground-made doll house can be placcd in a downtown
window two weeks before the carnival, and chances on it
sold. It can be displayed at carnivals along with stuffed
dolls which the children have made from factory reject
sacks. The doll house, furniture and dolls can keep an
arts and crafts group busy all summer.

A New Glove for Chris

15 FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY was still two weeks away,
but since he would be at camp then we decided to
give him the new glove before he left home. He had told
us a good deal about the glove he wanted, but he didn’t
really think he was going to get it, even though the one he
had was thin and torn. He had been discouraged by the
price. So was I when the man at the sporting-goods store
told me how much it was. The glove I had bought for
Chris’s younger brother two years before was not a full-size
major-league model, and I wasn’t quite prepared to have a
baseball glove cost almost as much as a suit did when the
boy’s mother and I were married. At fourteen Chris was a
big leaguer in spirit if not in body. While it was expensive
to equip the spirit so magnificently, it was, I told myself, in
the nature of an investment.

“0h gee,” he said when he opened the box. “A George
Kell model just like I wanted. With lacing across the top
of the fingers. Gee, thanks.” His face and voice conveyed
his thanks more completely than his words, and the glove
stayed on his hand for the next three hours, except during
dinner. We had to draw the line somewhere.

Chris and his brother Nick had a catch before dark, and
after they had undressed I went into their bedroom. They
were both in bed, with their baseball gloves on their hands.

Nick looked at his own older glove with passionate loy-
alty. “I wouldn’t trade this old glove for any new glove
in the world,” he said. “All broken in and everything,
pocket just in the right place.”

“There isn’t a better glove than mine anywhere,” said
Chris. He brought the glove up to his face and nuzzled it.

He was looking at the box now. “Made in America,” he
said. “My glove was made in America.” He laughed. “So

was I. So was my brother.” Then, as an afterthought,
“Baseball too. All made in America.”

“You’re pretty sound products,” I said. “Better turn off
the light and get some sleep.”

I went out on the front porch and lit a cigarette. Made.
in America, I thought, and wondered how well the boys
would discharge this responsibility. What a huge part of
their lives baseball has been, I thought. With the world
of the home and the world of school, baseball was really
their third world and the one which, on a conscious level,
they probably liked the best. This’ worried me a little and
I began to think back to see if I could discover what effect
the world of baseball was having on the boys.

The games the boys played in 'were pick-up affairs in-
volving a good deal of chauffering by the boys’ mother
and some telephoning by myself informing parents that
their wandering shortstop would be right home. Baseball,
I realized, was the first unsupervised team game the boys
played, the first social experience in which they had to
submit to the discipline and authority of their contempor-
aries. The rules they followed were not imposed by par-
ents or teachers, but by themselves. Not that this prevented
the rules from being argued or resented, but it did give
thcm a hint that rules as such were more than restrictions
created by an adult world to make children’s lives miser-
able. You couldn’t have a game without rules any more
than you could have a school without rules. These first im-
promptu games soon taught them a new word. Sport, or
good sport. You didn’t cry or get mad when you struck
out, dropped a fly ball or missed a grounder. You didn’t
blame it on somebody else. '

I remember the time Chris told me how he always missed
the ball when he was mad. “I just can’t hit it,” he said.
“Have to learn to control my temper.” ‘.

The boys were finding out other things which, now that

15

I looked back, made me feel better about this particular
world they were living in. They weren’t talking so loud
and long about their occasional home runs or fielding feats.
They began to appreciate the fact that a teammate’s run
counted just as much as one of their own, and they were

taking increasing pride in their sacrifice bunts on which '

others scored. The importance of teamwork was getting
home to them. They were particularly happy over their
increasing proficiency in executing a double play, in which
they had to think and act at top speed, making sure that
their performance was perfectly coordinated with that of a
fellow player. They were learning to stand up under pres-
sure, to give the best of which they were capable to the
team effort.

The older they got the harder they played and the oftener
they came home after a game with bumps and bruises both
physical and spiritual. Even living as far out in the coun-
try as we did there were few cleared areas big enough for
baseball games and those there were had an unusual num-
ber of hazards in the shape of stones, stumps and bushes.
The cuts and minor sprains didn’t bother them as much as
the bad bounces for it seemed bitterly unfair to them to
lose a game through no fault of their own. They tried
changing fields but it didn’t help much and they gradually
realized that’both they and their opponents were going to
get some pretty bad bounces no matter what field they
played on.

They began to keep their own batting and fielding av-
erages (to the delight of their arithmetic teachers), thereby

beginning to understand that each day had its own quota
of triumphs and defeats.

This thought reminded me of the morning at breakfast
when Chris was happily telling us of his good luck at bat
the previous afternoon, and I thought I’d better remind
him of one of baseball’s first precepts, in case he’d forgot-
ten it.

“Just remember,” I said, “that the hits you made yester-
day never won today’s ball game.” He had been silent for
a minute. “That’s a good rule,” he said.

I noticed, too, a subtle change in their attitude toward
winning. Of course they loved to win. But when they had
played long enough to realize they couldn’t win them all,
or perhaps even most of them, they came to feel that being
a good ball player implies a lot more than simply being a
winning one.

Even though the boys do not wear uniforms when they
play their games, now that I come to think about it I have
never known them to appraise a friend in terms of his
clothes, the kind of car or home his parents owned, or his
race, color, or creed. This history of the game they know
so well is illuminated with the names of players representing
many racial and religious groups. What they want to know
about a boy is what kind of ball player he is and what

kind of teammate.

The boys’ mother and I never had to redecorate the walls
of their room; they took care of that themselves with pic-
tures of players clipped from magazines and newspapers.
One of the most prominently displayed pictures appeared
the morning after the final game of the 1948 World Series.
It shows Lou Boudreau, manager of the victorious Cleve-
land Indians, implanting a jubilant kiss on the broad check
of Larry Doby, his Negro centerfielder. The year before,
Jackie Robinson, first Negro to play in the major leagues,
had had a spectacularly successful first year with the
Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson and Doby helped settle one
area for good and all on thousands of American play-
grounds. The old cruel labels were dropped. A new boy
was a potential Jackie Robinson, Phil Rizzuto, Ted Klus-
zewski or Joe Ginsberg.

I went into the living room where the boys’ mother was
sitting. What had I been doing, she asked.

“Thinking,” I said, “about basebal .”

“You and the boys. That’s all you think about.” But she
smiled as she said it, as befitted the mother of future stars.

“Sometimes I wouldn’t mind if that were all I had to
think about.”

“Well, there is the real world,” she said, “and the trouble
with baseball is that it’s not very much like the real world.”

“No,” I said, “that’s the trouble with the real world, it
isn’t enough like baseball.”

The light was still on in the boys’ room, but they were
asleep. Nick’s glove was on the floor, but Chris had put
his back in the box and set it on the table beside his bed.
His face was still turned toward it. I reached over to turn
off the light. Good glove, I thought. Good game, too.
Good boys. Made in America.

“. . . and the pursuit of Happiness”

T HE GENERAL OUTLINE of the 35th National Rccreation

Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September 28 to
October 2, is fairly well worked out. Such early planning
is always necessary for a meeting like the Congress which
involves dozens of discussion meetings and general sessions
and scores of program participants and consultants to serve
the nceds andointerests of all the delegates from all the
many and diverse organizations concerned with the pursuit
of happiness.

Invaluable help is rendered the Congress each year by
several committees. These committees, composed of both
lay and professional recreation leaders, constitute groups
which make it their special business to give advice on
matters of program, personnel and mechanics on behalf
of the entire movement. But all who are interested may
have a direct hand in helping plan the Congress by sending
suggestions immediately to T. E. Rivers, Secretary, Na-

tional Recreation Congress, 315 Fourth Avenue, New York
10, New York.

Local Arrangements Committee

Under the chairmanship of Robert Crawford, Philadel-
phia’s Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Rec-
reation, an active committee of Philadelphians is working
on plans to show off their historic city on the occasion of
this first National Recreation Congress ever to be held
there. Philadelphia is inspired, both by its memorable and
historic past and also by its recreation plans for the imme-
diate future, to offer delegates to the Congress a look into
the early days of our country and into the recreation fu-
ture of Philadelphia. Philadelphia has shown most imme-
diate and special interest in making certain that wives of
Congress delegates are made to feel welcome. Specific

plans to this end and for other Philadelphia features will be
announced later.

Bellevue-Stratford Hotel

The headquarters hotel gives every indication of being
able to accommodate the Congress this year without there
being any necessity of holding meetings outside the hotel.
Meetings rooms are large, the commercial exhibit area is
ample, and there is even going to be some space for educa—
tional exhibits. Delegates interested in bringing materials
for the educational exhibit section of the Congress should
get in touch immediately with T. E. Rivers so that the

necessary space can be reserved if possible. A hotel which
has housed national political conventions will receive an-

other test of its stamina and flexibility, but the Bellevue-
Stratford seems to measure up.

KNOW YOUR - CHILDREN

PLAY 18 not merely healthy exercise and a process of developing motor

skills but is an investment in social and emotional adjustment. The so-
cial aspects of development require close and continual observation to
detect signs of maturity level since this evidence is not as distinct as the
increase of size generally associated with physical growth. However, a core
or set of clues can be identified, in the social interactions displayed in play,
which tend to cluster at various age levels. These clues or characteristics
are helpful in child description, in the planning of program and can be
guides to corrective action. They are useful as approximations of maturity
levels and should, through understanding and recognition, serve as safe-
guards against adult pressures beyond social abilities and readiness. '

The procedure of segregating characteristics of play into child-age periods
is often misinterpreted and construed as rigid norms for children. This line
of reasoning would indicate that everything is known about child develop-
mcnt in play and that standards are fixed and final instead of experimcntal.
Play development must be viewed as a continuous process resistant to close
limitations and highly specific standards varying from one group to an-
other. Behavior is recognized as extremely variable in each situation and
in each child.

It is with these concepts in mind that the following chart is offered as an
experimental guide to promote greater understanding of the child and to
stimulate additional observation directed toward future refinement of knowl-

edge of the child at play.

from the water fountain or sparrows
grubbing for crumbs; there must be
stores, parks or vacant lots somewhere
nearby that warrant an exploration
tour.

What sorts of nature projects can be
pursued indoors? Surely many of these
can be transferred to the playground
that is not a natural onc? Children
have pets that they’d love to bring for
a day’s visit; most of them see trees,
somewhere, during the day. Apply
some ingenuity in using everyday hap-
penings and objects to arouse a “na-
turc intcrest” at the time they are no-
ticeable. Don’t wait for a “nature pe-
riod.” Help the children to open their
eyes and see the things about them. In
this way many can be helped to de-
velop a hobby that will last for the rest

of their lives. Weave your nature pro-
gram into all of your activities: Keep
your eyes open for interesting things.
The few suggestions below may stimu-
late ideas of your own:

One of the activities
on the Irvington, New Jersey, play»
grounds was a tree contest, the purpose
of which was to discover the finest trees
in Irvington, and to encourage greater
interest in shade trees.

The trees to be selected were limited
to pin oak, elm, Norway maple, and
the largest tree in the city. Only one
tree could be entered in each class.
Each contcstant designated the tree he
was entering, and its exact location, on
a blank obtained from the playground
leader.

Bird Houses. The making of winter
feeding stations and bird houses leads
to a desire to know more about the
habits of the birds who occupy the
houses. Bird houses made by children
can be installed on the playgrounds
and in parks where the children may
keep in touch with the birds they are
bcfriending.

Bird house building offers an activ-
ity valuable not only as an outlet for

the creative instinct but for the knowl-
edge of birds which it develops.

To make bird houses
safe and comfortable for their occu-
pants, certain principles of construc-
tion and design must be observed. A
well-built house should be durable,
rainproof, cool and readily accessible
for cleaning. Wood is the best build-
ing material. Metal should be avoided
because it is a great conductor of heat.
Weather boards, rustic cedar, and
strips of wood with the bark adhering
to them all make excellent materials ‘
and may easily be cut into pr0per
lengths and nailed together. In the
choice of wood an easily workable
kind, such as cypress, pine or yellow
poplar, is preferable. Sometimes ready
made boxes of the proper size may be
used with a little reinforcement.

In preparing wooden houses, en-
trance holes should be countersunk
from the outside to exclude rain, small
holes made in the middle-"of the floor
for drainage, and a row of small holes
bored just beneath the edges. Heads of
nails and screws should be set rather
deeply and covered with putty. Roofs
should be made with sufficient pitch
to shed water easily, the overhang in
the average house being from two to
three inches to protect the entrance
holes from driving rain.

When placed in trees, the houses
should be painted a dull shade of green
or gray; when mounted on a pole or

placed in other exposed positions, white
is the best color.

House birds differ decidedly in their
requirements for homes. Bluebirds and
wrens, for example, are content to
To make the
cans usable and keep them from be-
coming excessively hot, they should be
covered with bark, one end being re-
placed with a block of wood and an
opening of the proper size made in one
side of thc can. A hollow limb or
block of wood hollowed out in the
form of a woodpecker’s nest is a p0pu-

lowing basis: practicability, 40 per
cent; workmanship, 35 per cent;
uniqueness and originality, 15 per
cent; method of cleaning and ventilat-

In a number of cities awards have
been offered on the basis of the fol-
lowing points:

1. Thc most natural and practical
house for bird-life use.

2. The best house in workmanship.
. The most artistic design.
. The best combination house.
The most unique or odd house.
The best-made house of sticks.
The best-made house of bark.
The best-made house of tin cans.
. The best-made house of flat wood.

The bird houses made by the chil-
dren are frequently placed on exhibit
in store windows and other central lo-
cations before they are set up in parks
and playgrounds.

Prove It. This is a game in which
players sit in a circle. The one start-
ing the game says: “From where I am
I can see a gray birch.” The next one
says: “From where I am, I can see a
gray birch and a black cherry.” The
next player repeats all that the previ-
ous players have said, in exactly the
same order,.and adds another tree or
bird. It may be limited to what is seen
on one gray birch tree. If anyone
doubts the statement she may challenge
the speaker. Anyone caught in a mis-

take dr0ps out of the game.

Clubs. In Cincinnati, Ohio, the recrea-
tion department has, at various times,
sponsored clubs of Rangers and Ran-
gerettes. These can be joined by any
boy or girl between the ages of ten
and fifteen, on the playgrounds or at
the play centers. Each group is re-
quired to have some older person serve
as Ranger Guide. They have had as
their objectives the arousing and main-
taining of intcrest in nature and out-
of-door life; and they have sought to
teach members the crafts and skills of
the pioneer, woodsman, Indian, cow-
boy, farmer. They have been interested
in the preservation of wild life and
natural resources, and in community
service on projects along that line. No

set program is outlined for the clubs,
each being free to work out with its
Ranger Guide the type of projects in
which members are particularly inter-
ested. All programs have to have the
approval of the public recreation com-
mission, which provides a list of sug-
gested projects, with ways and means
of carrying them on. All projects have
to be “active program,” rather than
study.

Nature Hunt. Divide group into teams,
and give each team a list of nature ob-
jects which can be found in the area.
Each team should receive the same
list; and care should be taken not to
include anything that can be damaged
by the collector. The winning team, of
course, is the one which returns, on
signal, with the largest number of the
listed specimens. In addition, the win-
ners can be asked to tell, briefly, what
they know about each specimen.

Low Organization Games*

These are the active games that do
not require a definite number of play-
ers nor any court of specific size. They
use a minimum of equipment and are
adaptable to a wide range of ages.

Hit Pin Baseball. This game, which is
played on the Los Angeles playgrounds,
and on many others as well, requires
a diamond of any size—depending
upon the space available and the age
of the players. Make a circle of three
feet radius for home base, and one foot
square for the other bases. Stand an
Indian club in the center of each base.
Mark the pitcher’s box as in indoor
ball.

The batter stands in front of the club
on home base and tries to kick a soccer
ball. The pitcher uses an underhand
throw and tries to knock down the club
on home base before the batter has a
chance to kick it. If the pitcher suc-
ceeds in knocking down the club, the
batter is out. Balls and strikes, fair
and foul hits are the same as indoor
baseball. If four balls are called the
batter has a free kick. When the batter
makes a fair kick he must try to make
a complete circuit of the bases, running
outside the clubs and not knocking
them down. To put him out, the play-

ers in the field must pass the ball to
first, knock the pin over, to second, and
so on. If the ball gets ahead of runner
and thc club ahead of him is knocked
down with the ball, the runner is out.
He is also out if he knocks down a
club or runs inside any of the bases.

Fox and _Geese Dodge Ball. 1 Ten to
twenty participants may play. A large
circle is drawn on the ground. Half
the players stand inside and half out-
side the circle. The outside players
have a volley ball which they throw at
the ones in the circle, aiming below
the waist. The players in the circle line
up in a single file with their arms
around the waist of the player ahead.
The object of the game is to hit the
end player in the line. The leader of
the line may use his hands to bat the
ball away and his job is to turn and
twist the line so that the end man is
protected. This means he should face
the ball as much as possible. When the
end player is hit (below the waist only)
he dr0ps off. The game is played on
a time limit basis and the object is to
see which team has the longest line left
at the end of two minutes or any pre-
arranged time limit. At no time may
the head and end of the line connect.

Pandle Ball. 2 This is a new game for
girls. Use the old ping pong paddles
and take the handles off. Fix them so
they can be fitted onto the palm of the
hand, one on each hand. This game is
played like hand ball. Use up against
any wall and draw lines on the ground.
The court is approximately twenty by
twelve feet.

Jump the Ball. 2 Children stand in line,
one in back of the other. Usc a baby
ball. The first one ,in line throws the
ball against the wall, lets it bounce
once before jumping over it, and
on down the line. (Each jumps with
legs apart and lands on both feet.)
Whenever the player touches the ball
or fails to jump over it,, she goes to
the end of the line. (This game is very
simple, but we have seen youngsters
play it for an hour or more at a time.)

IMAGINE HOW you would feel if it were
your child who had run in front of
a passing carl Or, think how you
would feel if you were the motorist!
Practically all drivers feel they are cau-
tious enough, but still, children who
play in the streets are in danger. In
Seattle, something has been done and
is still being done about it.

It was at a spring luncheon of the
Seattle pre-school council, in April,
1929, that Miss Helen Reynolds, the
director of childhood education for
Seattle public schools, asked if this
group could do something about the
problem of children playing in the
streets. She had been reminiscing
about the lovely play yard she had had
as a child, when she suddenly con-
fronted the group with the idea that it
should find ways of keeping children
in their own yards.

Mrs. Morris Kennedy was so in-
spired that she conceived the idea of a
backyard playground contest among
the pre-school groups. Through a
friend, she gained the support of the
evening newspaper, which also donated
a tr0phy cup for the school entering
the most yards. The mayor issued a
proclamation for Playground chk.
Other papers and radio stations gave

much publicity. The police depart-

ment, park department, PTA, district
representatives of the National Recre-
ation Association and of the Automo-
bile Club gave active support to the
project. Service clubs and stores do-
nated prizes such as swings and sand-
boxes. Letters were written to New
York, Los Angeles and some twenty
other large cities for information re-
garding backyard playgrounds, and
from answers to these came some very
real, concrete help. Leading citizens
composed the roster of judges. Thirty
days after the initial luncheon the con-
test closed. Three hundred yards had
been entered from fifteen pre-school
groups.

The next year the results were even
more encouraging. The women worked
hard, publicity was good, and the yards
totaled 866. When the contest was
over, an inspection caravan followed
the all-city judges over the whole city.
It was fun, and mothers knew where
their children were playing.

Police department statistics definite-
ly indicated that lives have been saved.
In the twelve years from 1921 to 1933
there were 166 traffic fatalities and
5,935 trallic accident injuries to per-
sons under eighteen years of age. In
the fourteen years from_1934 to 19418,
fatalitics numbered 104 and injuries
3,660, showing a reduction of sixty-
two deaths and 2,275 injuries. This,
despite an increase in population of
over forty per cent, and an even great-

BACKYARI] PLAYGRHUNI

er increase in the number of automo-
biles.

Splendid c00peration was given by
the papers and radio stations. One sta-
tion carried a fifteen-minute weekly
program for the contest for three
months. Another instigated the theme
song, “Stay in Your Own Backyard.”
The PTA annual luncheon became the
“kick-off” meeting for all local, section
and district chairmen (all recruited
from local PTA groups), PTA presi-
dents, pre-school presidents, school
principals and other interested persons.

Other communities became
ested in the project, and inquiries

inter-

came so frequently that a booklet was
issued by a fire insurance company for
the pre-school division of the Seattle
Council of PTA. This included a brief
history, aids for the local chairmen,
blueprint sketches of a sandbox and
jungle gym, a list of the values of the
project, rules, photostats of letters from
the police department, Seattle public
schools, the endorsement by the mayor,
classes for judging, a sample of a judg-
ing sheet and an entry blank. In 1935
the booklet was reprinted and sent to
many cities throughout the United
States.

The technique of handling the con-
test went through certain modifications
in classes, district divisions, awards,
and finally sponsorship and objectives.
I_nl_1947, the Seattle Council of PTA
took over the project and encouraged
play areas and equipment for all age
children and adults. The name was
changed to the Home Playground Sur-
vey and Contest.

Interest in entering the contest was
stimulated in many ways by the local
chairmen, members of local PTA

ment and schools, for display in store
windows and at the schools. Tags were
made of ribbon, paper, pipe cleaners
and the like, according to the imagina-
tion of the local committee, for every
child who proclaimed at least one piece
of outdoor equipment at home. Even-
tually this was replaced by a standard
home playground button. Local chair-
men went to each room in their respec-
tive schools, giving talks, plays, asking
for pupil participation in writing stor-
ics and making posters about play-
ground space and equipment, and mak-
ing available directions for building

simple equipment. Motion pictures

taken of children playing on winning
equipment were shown to commercial
clubs, pre-school groups, PTA dads’
night programs. Judges were
structed to watch for practicability of
equipment, safety, evidence of use,
originality, flexibility for age groups,
and whether or not other children from
the neighborhood were permitted to
play in the yard. With the ever-in-
creasing number of yards brought into
the survey, an all-time high of 10,596
in 194-8 and 9,603 from elementary
students alone in 194-9, it was decided
that the junior and senior high schools

in-

should have a separate home recreation
program.

Although the stated purpose of the
project is to “stimulate interest in home
playgrounds by encouraging the build-
ing of new play yards and improve-
ment of present ones, to develop health,
character and safety,” the values of
these yards are greater. From the orig-
inal objective of keeping the children
off the streets, the project has grown
to provide or encourage the following:

1. Character development——children

ABOUT TWENTY YEARS ago in Youngs-
town, Ohio, Mr. John Chase, the ex-
ecutive director of the Youngstown
Playground Association promoted the
idea of backyard and neighborhood
playgrounds. Much success resulted
for two or three years but the idea was

abandoned during the depression in

the thirties. In 1950 Mr. Frank Tear,
president of the Youngstown Play-
ground Association suggested tl1at the

lier program. The association there-
fore secured my services for this proj-
ect.
The idea of backyard and neighbor-
hood playgrounds was more or less a
new undertaking, after the start of
twenty years ago, and a new approach
had to be made. The first thing done
was to get in touch with the Youngs-
town Vindicator for publicity, and the
newspaper gave the project prompt sup-
port. A reporter was assigned to write
special stories on the progress of the
program. Each Sunday a feature ar-

under supervision that is not obvious;
they learn consideration for and shar-
ing with others, fair play and sports-
manship.

2. Health—with equipment in their
own yards children have ample oppor-
tunity to develop muscular and neuro-
muscular coordination. Such activities
tend to correct many postural defects,
and play is in the fresh air and sun-
shine.

3. Family and social relationship—
children find one more reason for lov-
ing their home surroundings and their
parents, the family learns to play to-
gether, a neighborhood and community
spirit often arises, children participate
in a community project by writing
stories and making posters.

4‘. Safety—statistics show that fewer
traffic accidents occurred during the
years of high cooperation with this
project. Children are less apt to have
non-traffic accidents when under the
watchful eye of an intercsted adult.

5. Hobby development—families be-
come interested in nature study, con-
struction of equipment,
sports and outdoor fireplace activities.

editorial was also published entitled
“Small Playgrounds”—praising the
worthiness of the project. Local de-
partment stores helped with window
displays and by distributing entry
blanks for a contest. All three of
Youngstown’s radio stations gave the
project time on the air at periods
throughout the summer. Much inter-
est was created by this publicity.
However, we didn’t stop there. We
appealed to about a dozen civic organ-

The project was again promoted this
year with even greater success and
more interest was shown as indicated
by the number of new neighborhood
play areas started.

Parents’ committees were set up in
areas where the need for playgrounds
was most evident. They were encour-
aged to make a start. The Playground
Association helped by cutting the
grass, donating small equipment and
furnishing them with a booklet. In one

area—called the Dean Street Neighbor-
hood Playground—a mother took up a
small collection to start the project.
Her husband made most of the equip-
ment which now includes two sand
boxes, four swings, a basketball back—
board, two tether ball posts and washer
cups. Dean Street won first prize this
summer and are using their prize
money to buy material for a sliding
board. This play area is needed be-
cause it is more than a mile from the
nearest city playground and there are
about forty children on the one block.
Dean Street limits its children to those
under twelve years' of age, and the
parents take turns as supervisors. The
play area has as many as thirty-five
children on it at one time—all for a
cost of $25 to $30 for equipment.
This summer at the close of the con-
test, the Junior Chamber of Commerce
gave over one of their -luncheon meet-
ing programs to the Playground Asso-
ciation for presentation of awards. In-
terest in the project had doubled and
the number of contest entrants rose to

.. ninety. Four or five new neighborhood

playgrounds were started and many
new backyard play areas developed.
The manager of the play equipment de-
partment of a local store told the writer
that they had sold'more play equip-
ment this year .than in the previous ten-
year period. The Youngstown Play-
ground Association is a Red Feather
service and it is felt in Youngstown
that much good has been done in this
promotional work as a safety measure
and as a beauty and recreation factor
as well.

INDIA’S CHILDREN’S GARDEN

The National Recreation Association
has received an annual report for the
year 1951-52 from an organization in
India entitled “Balkan-ji-Bari.” The
name means “Children’s Garden,” and
the chief aim of the organization is to
make children as happy as possible and
to let them develop by themselves. As
the report states it:

“Balkan-ji-Bari brings children to-
gether, in their leisure time, for recre-

24

ation, but it is based on the belief that
recreation is a medium of education in
the most liberal sense, and that how a
child spends his leisure hours will be
an important determinant of the man
or woman he or she is to become. It is,
therefore, a school of discipline, but
the discipline is that of democracy. In
most of his life, the child is under

orders, at work and maybe at home,.

but Balkan-ji-Bari is his own affair.

Boys and girls meet in these centres as
often as possible—every day, if con-
venient, or once a week at least—and
arrange varied programmes. The Bari
has also a Pen-Friendship Section
which brings i children of different
places, here and in foreign countries,
in contact with each other. Thus the
organization is national in its way of
'working, but international in its out-

lookf’

remember how it goes? It starts
with one thing, adds others, but con-
tinues to retain the old ones. With me,
hobbies have been like that. A new
one comes along from time to time, but
the old ones still retain much of their
interest.

Looking back well over fifty years,
my first hobby was music, if one could
. call it that. It started with the jew’s-
harp. I was given a very good one by
an uncle. I still have it. And many an
hour was made miserable for the fam-
ily by the monotone of that instrument.
Even yet, once in a while I get it out
and see what can be done with it.

The next step was the Hageolet or
tin whistle. What patience my folks
must have had! Then the harmonica.
I wanted to play the violin, but couldn’t
scll the idea; so I banged on the piano.

William P. Uhlcr, Jr.

Along in the high school days interest
turned to the mandolin, the popular in-
strument of that time—the sax had not
yet arrived. That deveIOped far enough
so that finally I had a few pupils of
my own. Then later, I did try the vio-
lin and progressed far enough to play
in a Sunday school orchestra. The
many instruments and the few real
players helped to hide the defects of
the rest of us. We had more volume
than quality but we did have some fun.
The last attempt some fifteen or twenty
years ago was on the clarinet. That
progressed to the point of giving the
player considerable satisfaction, but
for some reason there were no bids to
join the Boston Symphony.

Early in life an interest in knots and
r0pe developed. It has continued
through the years and has given many
satisfying hours of study, practice and
demonstration of knots and square
knotting. There is much to be learned
in this field.

As a youngster I always had a bow
and arrows. Fortunately, in those days

when play activities were generally un-
supervised, my bows were weak and
poor. That kid stuff was no more arch-
ery than a shooting gallery is real ri-
fiery. As an adult, for a period of
many years—including the present—
archery has been a fascinating pastime
and study. Archers, like fishermen,
wax very enthusiastic and we admit
among ourselves that when it comes to
this subject, most of us are “nuts.”

And of course general observation
of nature,—-—birds, trees, plants—~and
gardening and fishing have all made
their contributions.

“Art, what crimes are committed in
thy name!” And I have been guilty
too. My first efforts were in the form
of coloring post cards and pictures
bought at the five and dime store. I
still have the first card I ever tried.
That poor cow was certainly plastered.
I even tried painting original pictures.
One was a desert scene with a tiny
camel along the pyramids. My mother
asked me what the turtle was doing.
That put a finish to that.

Then not being able to paint my own
scenes, photography was the natural
outcome. . The main interest here has
been landscape with the emphasis on
good composition. Here is a field with
endless possibilities, and it still ofiers
me a strong challenge.

Then by chance I tried coloring my
photographs with transparent oils. I
had tried water colors and aniline dyes
and did not like either; but the oils
have worked out very well, and prints
that are now completed seem good
enough to give pleasure to others as
well as myself. I even had one enlarge-
ment in a local art exhibit. Just now

25

I am in it to my ears. The big interest
is clouds, and as they are studied there
is more and more to be seen. Daily I
get new thrills observing cloud shapes
and colors, and trying to reproduce
them.

Then crafts. There is a long list and
most of them are among those I am
going to try some time, when I get a
chance. Ceramics, leather, plastics,
wood working. They come first on the
list, and one of these days. . . . The
beauty of it is, that while the old ones

still give satisfaction, there are always
new horizons—new worlds to conquer.

Poetry—if one says much about-it,
he is thought queer, pixillated. So I
write ’em and file ’em and enjoy the
process. Have been doing it for a long
while. Some seemed good enough for
publication and in fact have been pub-
lished. Writing professional articles
for publication has long been an old
story, a part of my job, but the publi-
cation Dof a poem is something else
again.

INTEREST YOUR youngsters, on the
playgrounds, in arts and crafts, by
giving them projects which call for the
construction of meaningful or useful
objects, or which tie-in with other
playground activities—such as making
masks for Big Injun day, leaf prints1
for nature projects and the like. Ac-
cording to Joseph Lee, to construct
things is a part of growth and in these
early years it is to make things with
one’s hands.

The following projects are merely to
start you in the planning of others.2

Out of it all has come not only much
personal satisfaction, but the realiza- ’
tion that you do not have to be a
genius, a world-beater, to make hob-
bies worthwhile. Most of us are just
ordinary folks with no special great
talents. All too often our abilities, alas,
are far less than our desires to create.
But the effort is still worthwhile, even
if the product turns out to be mediocre.
It is the doing that counts.

Indian and of- nature can be drama-
tized with masks around the council
lire or upon the school stage.

The making of masks should be
done in the simplest way possible, since
this should be a craft where all may
participate. Of all the various meth-
ods of mask making, perhaps the card-

board cylinder mask offers the best'

possible results with a minimum of ef-
fort and ability.

In making the cardboard cylinder
mask, a rectangular piece of cardboard
is wrapped about the head to deter-
mine the necessary size of the cylinder.
A symmetrical drawing of the animal

head is then made upon the flat card-
board and painted with opaque water
colors.

Beaks and noses are sofnetimes made
separately and are fastened to the cyl-
inder either by sewing or with Scotch
or adhesive tape. The mask is then
rolled into the cylinder form and
fastened together at the back.

Nut Shell Crafts 4——These require only
simple materials which may be at hand
or can be found in the woods. As the

 

title reveals, nut shells are a part of
the materials needed. Half shells of
walnuts, hickory nuts or butternuts,
pieces of bark, leather or felt and small

safety pins are the materials necessary.
In addition, include scissors and some
glue or pitch.

The drawings show the various de-
signs that can be used. The outline of
the animal is drawn upon the bark,
leather or felt and then cut out with
the scissors. Two' holes are punched
in the middle, one above the other and
a small safety pin is inserted. A half
walnut, hickory or butternut shell is
then dipped into glue or pitch and held
down firmly upon the bark or other
material until it adheres. To fasten the
shell more securely, bore a few holes
into the rim and sew it to the bark
with a few stitches. It can be,used as
a lapel ornament or necklace by thread-
ing a looped thong through it.

Tortoise and Hare Race 5—Crafts offer

the opportunity of making simple
games related to story telling.

known to everyone. It relates how the
hare, sure of his own speed, challenged

the notoriously slow tortoise to a race.

VIDRLTION OF CORD MOVES AMMAL‘

 

The hare started off but was soon so
far ahead that he decided to rest. It
was a warm day and he droppedioff to
sleep. After a while, the tortoise came
along and passed him but the hare
slept on. Just as the sun was setting,
the hare awoke and ran as fast as he
could, only to discover that the tortoise

had crossed the finish line long before.’

Thus, the slow and steady often win
the race.

Both the hare and tortoise are cut
from cardboard and strung with cords.
In racing, one end of the cord is fas-
tened to a stake or other object, while
the other end is held in the contest-

TWO-YEAR SURVEY of 8,414 children’s

hobby clubs, recently completed by
the American Hobby Federation, indi-
cates that the collecting of seals and
labels, not even in the t0p ten in the
last survey, now ranks first, displacing
stamp collecting, now in sixth place.
A seal label collection consists of hun-
dreds obtained from household items
such as foods, cosmetics, clothing, and
so on. They cost nothing.

Onc collector was surprised to find
that an old label from a Lydia Pinkham
bottle could be sold for one hundred
dollars, but for the most part trans-
actions do not involve the coin of the
realm.

Nine of the favorite hobbies are the
collecting of autographs, insects, match
box covers, miniatures. Only making
model planes, wood craft, painting,
and photography rank near collecting

in interest. One disquieting note is
the prevalence of the listing of throw-
ing rocks at trains as a delightful
hobby!

Some of the recreation training spe-
cialists of the National Recreation As-
sociation, on the other hand, mention
a current interest in the collecting of
match box covers with pictures on
them, rather than just printing, and
the age-old interests in collecting na-
ture specimens—bugs and butterflies,
and marbles of unusual color and size.
Frank Staples, association arts and
crafts specialist adds, “In the field of
crafts, most children do not consider
this as a hobby, but as an activity. It
becomes a hobby later in life as an out-
growth of interest and activity in this
field in childhood.” Anne Livingston
calls attention to the collecting of dolls
—with emphasis on clothes, coins, cow-

boy equipment, records, photographs
of movie stars, plus autographs and
shells.

In regard to the latter, the National
Geographic Magazine for last July car-
ried an article by Rutherford Platt,
“Shells Take You Over World Hori-
zons,” on shell collecting as a new
hobby. .

Why not follow’through on some of
these interests and help the youngsters
to establish hobby groups as a part of
your playground program? A letter
from the American Hobby Federation
says, “Since we published the results
of the F ederation’s study of children’s
hobby preferences, we have been de-
luged with letters from educators, par-
ents, directors of churches, community
centers, children’s clubs, home econo-
mists, asking questions pertaining to
the new number one hobby, collecting

seals and labels. In an effort to answer
all of these questions, we have written
a special bulletin which we are offer-
ing free to the public providing they
send a self-addressed stamped envelope
to us.”

The following suggestions are re-
printed from this bulletin:

How to Remove Labels from Packages
—-This should be done with care. Start-
ing at one corner, gently pull the label.
If it is stuck and you may tear it, start
at another corner. Use just enough
warm water to dampen it and pull
gently. It will then come off in perfect
condition. Just take your time. Labels
on bottles can be removed only by us-
ing warm water. Dye in most labels
will not run. After removing, paste
label in your book, using rubber ce-
ment, so that later you can remove the
label from the page if you wish. White
paste is also satisfactory. Packages
and bottles are not the only source of
labels. Hotels, airlines, steamship and
bus lines, vacation resorts, cities, states

THE WAY your indoor garden grows
will depend largely on the kind of
soil you use. If you live in the city,
you can buy small bags of soil, sand,
and humus from your Horist or depart-
ment store. If you dig soil from out-
doors use some from the woods or
from a garden where healthy plants are
growing. Buy sand such as builders
use for concrete. Seashore sand should
not be used because it would be too
salty for most plants.

To make good soil for indoor- gar-
dens use one part soil, one part humus,
which is decayed leaves, and one part
sand. The humus and sand help to
break up any clay which is in the soil

will often supply labels if you will
write or ask for them.

How to Start a Collection

Starting a seal and label collection
is easy and fun. Just look around the
house for packages. On most packages
will be found at least one label. In a
very short time a youngster will have
a few of them. On the average, thirty
packages of various kinds are brought
into the home every week by Mother
and Dad. Candy boxes, fruit cake,
cosmetics, medicine bottles are a few
of the sources for embossed metallic-
foil seals. Youngster should paste in
his book only one label of a kind as
part of his collection. Rule for ex-
change depends on how scarce a par-
ticular label is or how badly the col-
lector needs it. Collector swapping
value depends on the individual collec-
tor and his individual needs. One 1945
label may be worth six 1950 labels.
Metallic-foil seals are more valuable
because there are fewer of these than
of die-cut labels. Rate of exchange for

one 1952 seal might be two or three
1952 labels.

First club meeting is an important
one. Be sure to have some interesting
seals and labels to show youngsters,
tell where and how to get seals and
labels, how to paste them into books
and cards, how to classify them in cate-
gories. Send self-addressed stamped

envelope to American Hobby Federa-
tion, 12 East 41st Street, New York
17, New York, for seals and labels. We
have a limited number to distribute
free. Plan to have an exhibit as soon
as possible. Exhibits are the greatest
way to keep collectors’ enthusiasm
high. Plan to exhibit at least once
a month. Encourage youngsters to
bring in their collections to each meet-
ing. They like to show what they have
collected, others like to see them. Have
swap meetings. P

Youngsters like this hobby primarily
because it is fun. But it has many edu-
cational features, history and geogra-
phy among them, which accounts for

its approval by parents and educators.

Before putting soil into a pot or
box, lay some broken pieces of flower
pot or some pebbles in the bottom. If
possible, put a layer of charcoal over
this, then add soil to within a half
inch of the top.

Choose a sunny window sill for your
indoor garden. Keep the soil moist but
not soaking wet. If the soil cakes, pry
it loose gently with a fork, being care-
ful not to hurt the growing plant.

Wash the leaves of your plants once
a week by sprinkling water on them.
This indoor rain will dust the leaves
so that they can grow 'better.

Butter Box Gardens

Materials: Butter boxes about 5 inches
by 21/; inches by 2% inches or any
hcavily waxed cartons that will hold
about 2 inches of soil; adhesive tape;
seeds from lemon, grapefruit, orange,
corn, beans, peas, or watermelon; soil
and sand, humus and pebbles as de-
scribed above.

Directions: To prepare butter boxes
cut away the top of the boxes and tape
the corners with adhesive tape. If you

wish to make them more attractive;
cover them with aluminum foil. Punch
holes in the bottoms of the boxes and
place them on flat plates.

Fill the boxes as directed above.
Select the seeds you.wish to plant and
soak four of each kind in water for
about twelve hours. Plant them using
a different box for each variety of
secd. When the plants are two inches
high pull out the weakest ones, so that
there will be room for one healthy
plant to grow.

Sweet Potato Vine

Material: Sweet potato (ask your gro-
cer for one that has not been coated
with preservative to keep it from
sprouting), jar to fit potato so that
only lower end is in water, or larger
jar and toothpicks.

Directions: Fill a jar with water and
place a fresh sweet potato in it with
thc narrow end down. Only the lower
half should be in the water. If your
jar is not small enough to support the
potato, stick several toothpicks in the
potato and let them rest on the edges
of the jar. Put the sweet potato garden
in a warm, dark place until thc roots
begin to grow. Keep water at the
pr0per level at all times. Watch the
garden daily to see if more water must
be added.

In about a week the stems will start.
You will know that they are stems be-
cause they grow up instead of down.
When this happens move the garden to
a sunny place. A will bracket is a
good place for a sweet potato vine so

that it can trail down to the window

sill.

Fern Ball Or Sedum Ball

Materials: Creeping fern (Davallia
bullato) from woods or florist, or
stonecrops (Sedum) from garden or
florist, loose moss, rotted leaves, thin
wire.

Directions: Creeping fern is found in
the deep woods forming a thick mat
over a bare rock surface. Leaves are
dark shining green and are delicately
curved. They may be a foot long.
Some people call this fern Squirrel’s
Foot. If you can’t buy or find creep-
ing fern, use stonecrops (Sedum) .

and moss on the outside. Wrap thin
wire around the ball in many direc-
tions to hold it together. Cover the
ball with plants, tucking roots into the
soil.

Hang this garden in a window and
it will last many months. Keep it moist
by soaking it twice a week in a pan
of water.

Bird Seed Garden

Materials: Cake pan or bowl, sponges
of any kind, several packets of bird
seed.

Dampen a sponge in a
bowl or cake pan and sprinkle some

Watch for different kinds of plants.
Try other seeds from different pack-
ages on separate sponges. Count the

number of different plants.

A Farm in a Dish

Materials: Large, low bowl or dish,
sand, charcoal, soil, stones, toothpicks,
glue, moss, evergreen sprig, toy cows
or horses, aluminum foil, bean or cress
seeds.

Directions: Put a one-inch layer of
sand in the bottom of a bowl, add a
layer of charcoal, then add a three-
inch layer of soil. Make rolling hills
with soil and cover them with a lawn
of moss. In one corner of the dish
push the soil away and insert a cup
made from aluminum foil. This can
bc filled with water to make a pond

that can be edged with stones. In an-
other corner plant an evergreen sprig
to serve as a tree. Place small plastic
animals in the field to graze beneath
the tree. Fence them in with tooth-
picks stuck in the soil to look like a
picket fence. Glue toothpicks across
the fence to give it extra support.
Plant a little field of cress or bean
seeds.

A Garden From the Woods

Materials: Sand, charcoal, soil from
woods, plants from woods, flat cake
pan.

Directions: Gather soil and a green
carpet of moss from the woods. Dig
up some small woodland plants and lay

them in a box with some of the soil

that was around their roots. Prepare
a cake pan for your woodland garden
with sand, charcoal, and soil as you
did for your farm in a dish. Arrange
the woodland plants and keep moist.
Now you have a piece of woods grow-
ing on your window sill. You may be
surpriscd to find new plants growing
from seeds that were hidden in the
soil.

Chemieal Garden

Materials: Salt, laundry blueing. Mer-
curochrome, ammonia, saucer, small
pieces of brick or coke.

Directions: Put bricks or small pieces
of coke in a saucer. In a small bowl
mix together four tablespoons of salt,
the same amount of water and laundry
blueing, plus one of ammonia. Add a
few drops of Mercurochrome. Pour
this mixture over the bricks or coke.
Place the saucer on a window sill where
it will not be moved. Don’t Water it,
just watch.

Morning-Glory Vine

Materials: 2-inch flower pot, 6-inch
flower pot, sand, soil, humus, morning
glory seeds.

Directions: Scratch the hard coats of
five morning-glory seeds with a file
and soak them overnight in water.
Plant them in a small pot near, the sur-
face. Move the healthiest one to a
larger pot when it is a month old.

RECREATION

0n the Low-Budget Playground

As A general rule substitution is
frowned upon in the best circles,
but on the playgrounds with low bud-
gets it is a commendable trait.

The twin cities of Auburn and Lean
iston, Maine, which are separated by
only a river, each with seven play-
grounds, were allowed but a part-time
supervisor of arts and crafts. It was
convenient for one man to service both
recreation departments providing he
divided his time equally. Auburn’s
scven playgrounds serviced 1,002 chil-
dren from a population of 23,137;
while Lewiston, with the same number
of playgrounds had a population of
43,000 with 1,900 children registered.
My problem was to SUpply tools and
materials to keep them busy with but a
few dollars allowed for arts and crafts;
so it was very evident that substitution
was a very necessary requirement.

We made our own finger paints from
the very fine formula given in the
National Recreation Association’s Sum-
mer Playground Notebook, 1951 issue,
but found that finger paint paper was
too expensive. \Ve then tried out a
mnnher of cheaper papers and discov-
cred that a certain grade of “butcher’s
paper” had the right glossy surface and
worked to perfection although it was a
light cream color instead of white.
With this we could supply hundreds for
less money than the regular paper
would supply dozens.

Another substitute was a gesso for-
mula which was no cheaper but a lot
easier for the playground leader and
as satisfactory in the long run. In-
stead of mixing a gesso with whiting,

glue, and so on, we used Tide detergent
soap powder (one cup) with a half cup
of Zippy plastic starch—wwhipped it well
with an egg beater and then covered
jelly glasses, tin cans and cardboard
plates (the papyrus type is best). We
also cut circlcs from cardboard cartons
and covered these to make coasters and
wall placques. After this mixture dries,
it is hard and can be colored with
water colors or poster paints and she]-
lacked. When making -doll furniture

We found that sawdust and flour
modeling mixture was just a “play-
thing,” but by substituting wall paper
paste for the flour we had a mixture
that, when well dried, could be sawed,
drilled, whittled, painted and shel-
lacked. This mixture could be used to
fashion articles that were permanent
and could actually be used. A favorite
was the modeling of ashtrays. After
sandpapering, coloring and finishing
with a good spar or plastic varnish they
will give fine service in the home. Wall
paper paste is less expensive than flour
these days too.

In the old days when we wanted
small pieces of thin plywood, cigar
boxes were just the thing, but today
most cigar hoxes are made of paper.
However, hy using fine-toothed coping
saws or the regular jeweler’s saws this
heavy paper can he used for puzzles
and other small cutouts, providing the
furry edge is removed with a very fine
sandpaper. After painting with poster
paints, two coats of shellac should be
used. -"

Oscar C. Holt

Another problem on all playgiounds
was that of checkers. We made check-
erboards from heavy carton stock,
painted the squares with poster paint
and then applied a coat of shellac. A
local shoe shop furnished scrap sole
leather which we cut, with a one inch
punch, into circles and dipped these
in red and black lacquer. Checkers
made in this manner are as hard as
wooden ones and will not break. Thus
we had thousands of checkers for the
price of a punch and two cans of
lacquer. '

We finished our season with a mu-
sical pageant, “Children of America,”
and the supervisor in charge called
upon the arts and crafts department for
props. One request was for a covered
wagon. It had to be rubber tired, be-
cause of the ball field on which we
were using it, and it had to roll easily
because a dozen “Indians” ten to f our-
teen years old had to wheel it in loaded
with a dozen youngsters. Just try to
find horse drawn vehicles in this mo-
torizcd age! Even Maine farmers use
tractors and power machinery nowa-
days. The only thing we could find that
met the above requirement was a ma-
nurc spreader—so that was our substi-
tute covered wagon.

Wc fixed it up'with a canvas top,
arrows from the archery group stick-
ing from the sides, and with a large
(water) barrel lashed to the rear, to
hide the spreading gear, it made an ex-
cellent prop.

Yes, when it comes to stretching ust
so many dollars over so many weeks
to keep so many children busy, substi-
tution becomes a virtue.

Sohool-City Cooperation 

of Recreation Areas

THE GROWTH of cooperative action on
the part of school and municipal au-
thorities in the acquisition, planning,
construction and maintenance of areas
and facilities designed for school and
community recreation use is a striking
and significant development in recent
years. The removal of real and imag-
inary obstacles that for many years de-
terred such cooperation and the resolu-
tion of jurisdictional differences be-
tween school and city authorities rep-
rcsent a drastic and desirable advance
in relationships and practice.

As Mr. Malcolm Kirkpatrick has
pointed out, “Traditionally our school,

of the relationship of city planning to
school plant planning,2 involving an
analysis of one hundred city plans pub-
lished between 1905 and 1933, more-
over, revealed that such cooperative
planning received little consideration
during this period. It indicated that
general volumes on city planning were
but little conccrned with schools or
school plant planning, and that twenty-
one of the one hundred city plans stud-
ied failed to include any mention of
schools. Ten of twenty-five books on
city planning made no mention of
schools and only five of sixty-live
school building surveys showed coop-
eration hetween school and city plan-

Failure to provide adequately for
community use in planning new school
buildings, or to give recreation author-
ities responsible for such use an op-
portunity to review school plans, has
proved a serious handicap to recrea-
tion programs. “Buildings not planned
for recreational use” was the only diffi-
culty threatening cooperative use that
was frequently reported in a 1950
study of school center operation in
105 cities.3 Recent stcps to correct
this diiliculty, therefore, promise more
satisfactory and effective use of schools
for community recreation in the years

ahead.

Cooperative action follows no uni-
form pattern, but has been achieved in
various ways. Formal agreements en-

nd action in other cities.

Grand Rapids, Michigan

The desire to construct school build-

[1 financial and administrative difficul-
es to the school and city authorities
1 Grand Rapids, as elsewhere. These
ifficulties have been overcome how-

eneficial results. They are described

A specific plan of development is

defining the “school area” and “city
'ea.” “School area” is the site where
e school building is placed, and such
3ve10ped areas as will principally be
sed for school purposes. lts extent

determined by negotiations between

e representatives of the city and the
hools and is decided upon for each
hool. The “school area” generally

 

“‘The Park-School System in Grand Rap-

5. Michigan" by Frederick C. See, Parks
d Recreation, November 1952.

PHIL 1953

contains the school building itself, the
main approaches to the building, the
hard-surfaced wet-weather play areas,
the kindergarten play and apparatus
area, a portion of the play and appa-
ratus area for the older children, some
play field sections, and landscape fea-
tures.

The balance of the grounds is the
“city area” and contains all the facili-
ties and playfields which are principal-
ly used by children and adults during
off-school hours and vacation. A clear
and concise definition of these areas is
very important since it involves the
expenditures incurred by the board and
the city. These dividing lines are on
paper only and do not under any cir-
cumstances influence the overall de-
sign of the grounds, nor are they vis-
ible in any way.

The park-school agreement of the
City of Grand Rapids states that the
cost of development of the “school
area” shall be the responsibility of the
board of education and the cost of the
development of the “city area” shall
be borne by the city. It is evident by
this arrangement that the board of ed-
ucation is paying for facilities which
are beneficial mainly to the school it-
self, while the city pays for installa-

tions which mainly benefit the general
public.

Ownership and Maintenance

of Land

The ownership of land to be used for
the park-school plan is divided into
three categories, where:

1. The board owns all the land.

“minimum area” at a suit-

able location. (A minimum area is
five acres for an elementary school.)

3. The land upon which the program
is to be conducted is owned by the city,
or where the board owns adjacent land
which does not contain the “minimum
area.”

Where category 1 exists, the school
board leases to the city for a consider-
ation of $1.00 per annum the amount
of acreage over and above the five
acres “minimum area.” The reason
for this is to prevent the criticism that

the city is spending capital money on

R

George Butler

of the land to be determined by an ap-
praiser mutually agreed upon. These
types of ownership seem to be fair and
equitable and have so far not resulted
in any disagreement. The boundary
lines of these parcels, whether leased
or owned, are not visible on the
grounds and the previously mentioned
“school area” and “city area” are not
the same as the leased or owned lands.

Under the agreement the city repairs
and maintains all areas outside of the
building line with the exception of
snow removal from school walks. The
board of education compensates the
city for the repair and upkeep of the
areas and facilities located within the
“school area.” The amount is a pre-
determined, sum paid annually and is
based upon the estimated amount mu-

tually agreed upon and may be changed
from year to year.

The “school area” is under the con-

ing all other hours, control of the area
is under the city.

This agreement, including the leases,
is to endure for a twenty-year period
unless changes in the city charter make
it impossible, either for the board, or
the city, to incur obligations over so
long a period, in which case it is to

endure over such a period as is legally
permissible.

Joint Planning of
School Buildings

Under an increased tax levy, the
board of education in Grand Rapids
intends to build eighteen new schools,
practically all of which will be park-
schools and several existing schools
will likewise be converted to the extent
that this is possible. The architects
work in very close cooperation with the

35

design office of the park department
and the buildings are so designed that
they will serve their dual purpose to
the greatest advantage.

The location of the structure on the
site is so planned that the maximum
use of playground and recreation fa-
cilities is obtained. The layout of the
school is so designed that toilet facili-
ties, arts and crafts rooms, play lead-
ers’ rooms, park storagc rooms and
so forth are directly accessible from

the outside and in proper relation to

facilities of Pershing Field. The school
board maintains the athletic field and
the park board maintains Pershing
Field, and each party grants to the
other the free use of its facilities so
long as that use does not conflict with
the program use of each of the parties.

In 1948 the two boards conferred
with reSpect to plans for the coopera-
tive development and use of adjoining
school and park properties. A special
committee appointed to study the pro-
posal, which involved improvement of

These Special considerations add very
little to the cost of new structures, but
pay enormous dividends in the proper
operation of the park-school.

Minneapolis, Minnesota

Several examples of cooperation be-
tween school and park authorities have
been recorded in Minneapolis in re-
cent years. In 1941, for example, the
board of education prepared a plan
for an athletic field for the new South-
west High School, utilizing its block of
land to the east of Pershing Field, a
city park, together with the interven-
ing street, and also a small strip at the
east end of Pershing Field. This plan
was agreed to by the park board which
entered into an agreement with the
board of education providing for thc
joint use of the athletic field and the

the park and the school and the re-

ommended a plan 5 which included the
following:

shall assume the cost of construction of
all park areas plus school property
between the center line of vacated Six-
teenth Street and the cross-walk along
the south side of the school building.

“The Board of Education shall as-
sume the cost of construction of the
area north of the above-mentioned
cross-walk. This will consist of hard-
surfacing the playground on the Port-
land Avenue side of the Madison
School site.

“In order to facilitate the develop-
ment of the unit, it is deemed advis-

able that the above should be construct-
ed concurrently.

“The Board of Park Commissioners
shall maintain the area as constructed
by them, and the Board of Education
shall likewise maintain the area devel-
oped by them under this particular
agreement.

“As Operation of this unit will be
a continually changing factor, it is
deemed advisable that this matter be
determined by the executive staffs or
their representatives.”

Even more significant was the fol-
lowing resolution which was adOpted
in 1948 as setting forth a policy as-
suring cooperation between the two
boards on future projects:

“WHEREAS, The Board of Education
and the Board of Park Commissioners
of the City of Minneapolis are both
public bodies with different spheres of
public servicc and separately govern
their properties, and

of policy shall govern the actions of
the two departments in the execution
of their plan of cooperation for joint
planning and separate use of combined
properties as follows:

That the combined facilities are a
single community asset, the op-
eration of which should be so con-
ducted as to provide maximum
community benefits which can be
derived through such joint use.
The facilities are to be Operated
jointly or separately, in whole or
in part, in accordance with details
as agreed upon by the executive
staffs or their representatives.
keeping in mind that the foremost
function of such Operation would
be the expenditure of available
public funds in such a way as to
provide the greatest service to the

community.” 3

The latest example of the results of
such COOperation is in the construction

of the Maude Armatage Public Ele-
mentary School, named in honor of a
woman who served on the park board
for thirty years and who was long an
advocate of joint park-school planning.
The school is the result of cooperative
planning on the part of the park board,
thc board of education and community
groups. The building occupies about
four acres of a twenty-two acre site;
thc remainder is being developed by the
park board as an all-year recreation
area for use by all ages. The school
provides a center for activities for all
of the citizens the year round. The
library, which is a part of the city’s
library system, the gymnasium and the
ISO-seat auditorium are located near
the front entrance and parking area so
meetings and programs can conceiv-
ably be held during school hours. The
focal point of the school as a commu-
nity center, however, is a series of
community rooms at ground level uh-
dcr a classroom wing. Because this
section can be shut off from the rest of
the school, community groups can hold
their programs while school is in ses-
sion as well as after school. One large
storeroom, which opens onto the play-
grounds on the lower level, has been
rescrved for park board equipment.
(See illustration.)

New York City, New York

For many years in New York City,
the board of education provided its
own school playgrounds, while in the
same general neighborhood the park
department operated children’s play
areas. Some ten years ago, however,
I the two departments agreed on a plan
I which would eliminate duplication and
give greater recreational opportunities
for both the schools and the community
at a decreased per capita cost. Owing
to the savings effected, it was possible,
in many cases, to provide much larger
playgrounds attached to the schools
than would have been possible had each
department developed independent
playgrounds.

In general, the pattern has been for
the board of education to acquire the
land and for the park department to
deve10p it and provide for its main-
tenance. The planning is done by the
park department in close cooperation
with the board of education so that the

APRIL 1953

school program of health education and
recreation may be carried out during
school hours.

Each playground usually has a small
fenced-off area, called a “Mothers’ and
Babies’ Playground,” which is not used
by the schools, but is operated under
park department leadership. All other
parts of the playground are reserved
during school hours for the exclusive
use. of the school. After school hours
and on Saturdays and holidays and
during vacation periods, the play-
ground is opcn to the general public.

The selection of locations for such
jointly-operated playgrounds is made
by agreement between the two depart-
ments. The park department studies
the board of education building pro-
gram to determine which projects will
afford opportunities to provide play-
grounds that will not duplicate present
facilities. The board of education thcn
approves the joint opcration dcscribed
above.

Thcre is no question that this plan
has substantially increased the play-
ground facilities of thc city, both for
the children in the schools and for the
community at large. It is being accom-
plished economically by avoiding du-
plication and by obtaining greater util-
ization of areas and facilities. Play-
grounds serving both school and city
have been completed at thirty-nine
schools and a still larger program is
contemplated for the future. (See il-
lustration.)

Austin, Texas

The public school system and the rec-
reation department have long coop-
erated in the use of facilities, but this
relationship was crystallized in 1950
by the adoption of the following reso-
lution by the city council and the board
of education:

“WHEREAS, it is the purpose and pol-
icy of the City of Austin through the
Recreation Department to develop, op-
erate and maintain community recre-
ation facilities;

WHEREAS, it is the policy of the Aus-
tin Public Schools to develop, con-
struct, maintain, and operate school
plants offering facilities for commu-
nity use;

WHEREAS, it is recognized, both by
educational and recreational agencies

through the country, that the develop-
ment of school plants and recreational
areas for joint use is a sound practice;

WHEREAS, the City Plan Commission
firmly believes in the policy of estab-
lishing neighborhood playgrounds ad-
jacent to public school sites;

WHEREAS, certain school facilities

are now in use by the Recreation De-
partment;

WIIEREAS, recreation and education
are closely parallel in many purposes,
objectives, and programs;

WHEREAS, the practice of establish-
ing school plants and neighborhood
playgrounds for joint use will effect
a direct saving to the citizens of
Austin;

Therefore be it Resolved, That in the
interest of better service and greater
economy to the community, a joint
committee of the staff personnel be-
tween the City of Austin and the Austin
Public Schools be appointed and au-
thorized to study ways and means, de-
velop and recommend plans and poli-
cies for the establishment of school and

recreational facilities and sites for joint
use ”7

Since the ad0ption of the preceding
resolution, thc schools and the city
have been buying property for joint
development as elementary schoolsiand
playgrounds. Four areas have already
been purchased and four others are
in the process of being acquired. A de-
tailed statement of policy agreements
to implement the resolution has been
prepared and is being studied by the

local authorities.

This interesting question is answered by
comments from outstanding leaders in
the recreation leadership training field.

The Question

The happy moment arrived for Jack
Jones, recreation major, “A” student,
new candidate for teaching. He stepped
briskly up to the front door of the ele-
mentary school where he had been
summoned to his first assignment.

Right behind him a large bus drove
in to the school yard and one by one
each child got out. Jack paled. He
was surprised. He did not expect. to
see this.

One little girl was being lifted ofl
the steps by the 13118 driver. He hand-
ed her two little crutches which she
thrust expertly under her arms. She
hohbled off in rapid rhythm. The next
child was placed in a wheel chair. Two
seconds later she was right behind her
friend with the crutches. Other chil-
dren followed—this one with a brace,
that one with his cane. They hobbled
and limped, and made their way to the
hallway—chatting and laughing, as
would any group of children, any-
where.

Jack proceeded down the hallway.
Hardly was he introduced to the prin-
cipal, before he eXplained that he had
no knowledge whatsoever about handi-
capped children. The principal pleaded
with him.

“Please stay. These children need
so much help,” she said. “We have

waited so long to get someone‘ assigned
especially to us. We are in desperate
need of a recreation program and our
classroom teachers and therapists are
already loaded with a more than full
schedule.”

Jack wanted to help. The challenge
was great. The need intense. With the
assistance of a dictionary (to learn
the names of the most common disabil-
ities in a children’s atypical program),
outside professional guidance, night
reading, consultation, and just plain
sweat, he proceeded.

If there are to be any constructive
suggestions to better meet this situa-
tion and many others, in our nation
today, those of us who are serving on
the physical education staffs of college
faculties must turn our critical eyes
upon our institutions of teacher train-
ing. What is happening, at the profes-
sional level, to provide the training and
experience necessary to prepare our
young candidates to serve in these ca-
pacities with adequacy?

The job of recreation leadership has
grown with the need in the communi-
ties. If we are sincere in our aim to
provide rccreation adapted to every age
and every capacity, we are including in
that concept every child, whether he is
physically capable and in complete con-
trol of his physical functions or only
partially capable of physical movement.

What is the record in our profes-
sional training programs? How many
curricula include recreation courses for
the handicapped—training experience

with the handicapped—play programs
especially designed for the disabled—
sports adapted for the special situa-
tion—practical teaching and leadership
in special schools, Special playgrounds:
and special programs for child and
adult rehabilitation?

The fact that the demand for atten«
tion to the disabled is ever growing
nationally is brought to our awareness
by the continual national drives for
polio—cerebral palsy—rheumatic fever
—a few in the field of disabilities plag-
uing our population today.

To deal with these disabilities one
has to understand them. No intelligent
teaching-guidance of any kind, whether
on the intellectual or emotional hasis,
can be effective if the recreation leader
is totally ignorant of the disability with
which he is dealing. What can he ex-
pect of that child, what are the goals
to be aimed for, what progress, if any,
what motivation, and so on?

In this.era of high specialization, we
expect our worker on any professional
level, whether it is medical, mechani-
cal, or economical, to have the partic-
ular knowledge and special skills in the
specific area in which he is called upon
to do a job. The field of recreation
can meet this challenge as well as the
other professions, if it is aware of the
need.

In one large city center today we
could place, immediately, over one
dozen recreation trained majors with a
special knowledge of recreation in re-
habilitation and corrective procedures

from accident and war. If ever a need
was plain, it is this one. Are we going
to meet it?

There is a tendency on the part of
agencies, schools, and institutions
where recreation is a secondary func-
tion to create recreation positions and
then fill them with unqualified people.
The dift'iculty in part is often due to
the lack of understanding of qualifi-
cations for recreation specialists and
the agency’s failure to define the po-
sitions adequately.

it is good to have such questions
raised; and the authors have been
successful in crealing considerable
discussion. If it results in more in-

Recreation Training Experts Offer Connnents

o It is a valid assumption that pub-
licly supported recreation programs
should be planned and conducted to
meet the needs and interests of all of
the people; and in this respect the ma-
jor point of the authors of “Are We
Meeting the Newer Challenge?” is well
taken. Yet it does not follow that such
programs and their leaders should, or
can be expected to, meet all of the in-
terests and needs of all of the people
all of the time. One would hope, never-
theless, that the needs and interests of
the “exceptional” child, would receive
careful and continuous attention by
public agencies responsible for recrea-
tion and education. .

Although the authors do not men-
tion it, the case which they make for
helping the physically handicapped
should apply equally to the child whose
“exceptional” status grows out of men-
tal maladjustment, and there are many
of the latter.

As far as public recreation programs
are concerned, it could be, and often
is, argued that there is much to be
gained in not isolating the exceptional
child from the remainder of the group
—something which is not uncommon
in the process of trying to give special
attention to the handicapped youngster.
This is not to deny, however, the fea-
sibility and wisdom of leaders being
able to recognize and understand the
special problems involved.

Without question, experience shows
that recreation for the ill, injured and
disabled, cannot be successfully accom-
plished in the absence of the leader
having at least a reasonahle amount of
knowledge of the participant’s needs
and capabilities, as well as of his in-
tercsts. This information, coupled with
a basic knowledge of the physical and
psychological factors involved, to-
gether with certain skills related to re-
habilitation, are what make it possible
for the leader to work successfully with
the folks he hopes to help return to
normal living.

The major question—which the au-
thors leave unanswered—is how recre-
ation leaders who are expected to serve
the entire community may receive this
specialized training in view of the prep-
aration which is required just to make
them recreation leaders. Maybe this is
an appropriate subject for another ar-
ticle!

CHARLES K. BRIGHTBILL, Professor

of Recreation, University of Illinois.

0 The article “Are We Meeting the
Newer Challenge?” is of special inter-
est to those of us who are in the train-
ing ficld.

Though it indicates that there is a
great need for persons trained and
qualified to work with handicapped
people, I question whether the training
centers have been made aware of this
need. We have provided one full time
recreation director for a camp for car-
diac children, and two summer direc-
tors for a camp for crippcd children.
We have had no other requests for such
leadership.

To receive training for this specific
area of work requires special courses
in addition to the regular recreation
curriculum, plus an internship in which
the trainee works with the type of han-
dicapped people he will be expected to
work with while employed. I say “type”
because one cannot group all handi-
capped people into one category. Each
type needs special training and under-
standing. This area of recreation lead-
ership appeals to only a very limited
number of students. Departments of
recreation in our universities find dif-
ficulty in justifying the offering of a
course for so few students. Several of
our regular recreation courses should
prove valuable to persons who plan to
enter this area of leadership, but they
do not provide all of the training neces-
sary for such leadership. Perhaps the
demand for these leaders may cause
some university to specialize in this
area. Among the students being trained
in hospital recreation by some of our
universities, there may he some stu-
dents fairly well trained for work with
handicapped people.

The authors of the article imply that
the principal of the school employed
the recreation leader without first in-
forming him that he would be expected
to work with handicapped children. I
cannot imagine any qualified school
principal employing anyone on this
basis. It would be very unfair to the
leader. The authors refer to college
physical education departments as the
potential training centers for training
recreation leaders; whereas it is the
function of the recreation staff of the
university, and not the physical educa-
tion staff, to train persons for the rec-
reation profession. In their reference
to program, they stress the adapted
sports program. Recreation for any
group should not he limited to sports,

39

but should be much broader. Crafts,
art, music, hobbies, drama, nature in-
terests, table games and other such ac-
tivities are all recreation interests.
The authors are to”be commended
for bringing this challenge to us in the
training field. It indicates that we have
only scratched the surface in our in-
terpretation of recreation to the public,
and in providing training for all recre-

ation situations.
GARRETT G. EPPLEY, Chairman, De-
partment of Recreation, Indiana U ni-

versity.

0 In the first place, I feel that there
are two separate problems presented
in this article: (1) recreation education
and (2) recreation Opportunities for
the handicapped.

Concerning the first problem, we
have done little for all people. Educa-
tion for leisure-time activities on every
level of education from elementary
school to college has been a haphazard
undertaking, which, if we can judge
from the number of people who par-
ticipate only by being Spectators, has
failed completely. From the stand-
point of training, the college can train
any number of people to do recreation
education in the schools, but at this
time, schools do not yet recognize that
there is a need for such a person. This
phase of education generally is com-
pletely unorganized. At the present
time, suggestions for organizations are
tentative primarily because the neces-
sary research and eXperimental plans
have not been developed widely enough
to give validity to any one method.

Considering this lack in the general
recreation education field it seems com-
pletely unrealistic to eXpect the spccial-
ized field of recreation education for
the handicapped to receive particular
attention.

The one bright Spot in this regard,
I think, may be found in the private
voluntary agencies that are undertak-
ing work of this kind. In these agen-
cies for the blind, the deaf, the crip-
pled, those with cerebral palsy or dia-
betes, Special programs have been de-
velOped to help these people to live
with their handicaps. However, much
of the philos0phy behind these pro-
grams is directed toward helping the
handicapped to take their place in nor-
mal community living. This leads to
the second problem presented in this
article namely, recreation Opportuni-
ties for the handicapped.

Over-all, my philosOphy is that han-
dicapped persons will lead more satis-
factory lives if they can feel themselves
part of the whole community rather
than appendages attached thereto. To
this end, I believe that our whole aim
in any rehabilitation program for a

40'

person who has been disabled is to
help him to find the activities, recrea-
tional and otherwise, in which he can
participate with others. Psychological-
ly, one of the greatest difficultes in
working with the handicapped is their
desire to withdraw from the world in
order to hide their handicaps. Help-
ing them to overcome this attitude is
one of the most difficult parts of a re-
habilitation program.

When we think of the rehabilitation
programs that are needed for those
disabled congenitally or by accident,
we cannot think of just the physical
program. A rehabilitation program, if
it is worth its name, helps the disabled
person to be readjusted mentally, phy-
sically, emotionally, and socially. To
this end, those working in, the field
need to work as a team with each spe-
c1alist contributing his share. A recre-
ation specialist working in rehabilita-
tion has a definite contribution to
make, by helping the individual to
learn how to use his leisure. If the rec-
reation specialist is to render a maxi-
mum service to the individual, he will
have to know the limitations that the
handicap imposes upon the individual.
Except in cases where recreation is
used as therapy, I do not believe that
the recreation worker needs to have
any depth of pathological knowledge
of specific diseases. When we consider
recreation as therapy, then, I think we
have a. different problem and one which
is so much in its infancy that we have
little basic knowledge on how to train
people for recreation therapy.

I feel strongly that we need to clar-
ify our thinking on what is recreation
and what is recreation education, so
that the public, generally, will begin to
understand that recreation is not an ex-
tension of teaching, but comprises
many factors, some of which are simi-
lar to teaching and some of which are
very‘ different. The problem presented
certainly presents a challenge, but the
problems outlined in this article repre-
sent, in my opinion, just a small frac-
tion of the total- problem.

EDITH BALL, Instructor in Education,

School of Education, New York Uni-

versity.

o I have referred the article, “Are We
Meeting the Newer Challenge?” to sev-
eral members of our recreation staff.
Their comments are: “The idea basi-
cally expressed by these writers is im-
portant. However, if they wish to bring
about change, namely better and more
professional education of teachers and
recreation workers, this article as writ-
ten may not help. It tends to create a
little resistance, and there may be the
question among some readers as to
whether it is based on sufficient facts.

Perhaps the authors try to do too much
in one article. Why not really show
the need for better professional educa-
tion for such a situation as is described,
and concentrate on one point? If pos-
sible, we suggest stating the need or
problem in one article, and answering
it in another.”

BEN W. MILLER, Chairman, Depart-

ment of Physical Education, U niver-

sity of California.

0 In addition to my own reactions to
this article, I have secured comments
from one of my colleagues who is func-
tioning in the specific area of hospital
recreation.

In paragraph seven, we note that the
authors do not recognize the fact that
there are recreation staffs as well as
physical education staffs in colleges.

We would add to their statement,
“The field of recreation can meet this
challenge as well as other professions,
if it is aware of the need,” and if those
who work with the handicapped urge
college recreation faculties to give this
special nebd more attention.

If there are actual positions open
in this special field of recreation with
crippled children, then no doubt educa-
tors will include more emphasis on
such special training. Those adminis-
trators who deal with programs for
handicapped children should make
their needs known to institutions offer-
ing professional preparation in recre-
ation. The challenge with such chil-
dren and adults requires specialists who
are equipped in the various skill areas
that are included in most professional
training programs in recreation today.
Currently there are sevcral colleges and
universities that have courses, and/ or
curricula, which deal specifically with
hospital recreation. Programs for phy-
sically handicapped people, whether
they reside in the community setting or
the hospital setting, might secure the
best equipped persons, at present, from
current curricula in hospital recreation.

Finally, the opening sentence of the
article may tend to give false evidence
regarding recreation majors entering
school teaching situations. We should
be careful not to consider recreatior.
for the handicapped as synonymous
with rehabilitation programs and Spe-
cial education.

G. B. FITZGERALD, Director of Recre

ation Training, University of Min

nesota.

0 This article is rather a general ap
proach to the problem with practically
no concrete suggestions for colleges
Also, the emphasis appears to be di
rected solely at the physical. Anyont
who deals with the disabled knows tha
thc psycholOgical and physical factor:

RECREATIO?

cannot be separated. I believe their
article should have at least made men-
tion of this factor.

My greatest concern revolves around
the implication that a college recrea-
tion training program can handle this
preparation without the cooperative aid
of various other college departments.
That single issue is one of the greatest
weaknesses of college training pro-
grams today.

J OIIN L. HUTCHINSON, Associate Pro-

fessor, Teachers College, Columbia

University.

0 This is not a newer challenge since
many of us have been working on it
since the 1930’s.

The article does not need the nega-
tive approach of assuming that nothing
is being done about the problem. It
would be better if it had been based on
rcsearch to see what is actually being
done. The University of Minnesota has
a graduate program well geared to
meet this need. Here at Cortland, we
havc been offering a course “Recrea-
tion for the Atypical” and other courses
such as “Card and Table Games,” and
so on. Furthermore, we are developing
a special curriculum in Hospital Rec-
reation, to parallel the one in Com-

munity Recreation.

There appears -to be an assumption
that all that is needed is physical rec-
reation for physical rehabilitation. All
individuals whether physically handi-
capped or not, need Opportunities to
develop their participatory and creative
powers in a broad range of recreational
areas: music, art, reading, poetry,
crafts, nature as well as the so called
physical recreations. Certainly the phy-
sically handicapped need these.

I doubt if it is a newer challenge in
physical rehabilitation, but rather a
constant challenge to assist in the re-
habilitations of the total personality
and increasingly to heighten and en-
rich the joy of living.

HARLAN G. METCALF, Chairman, De-

partment of Recreation Education,

State Teachers College, Cortland,
New York.

0 The article, “Are We Meeting the
Newer Challenge?” needs qualification.
It aims to indicate that nothing is be-
ing done, nor has been done, in pro-
fessional schools to acquaint future
teachers and leaders in recreation of
the problems of the handicapped.

To the contrary, courses entitled as
adapted sports, adapted physical edu-

cation, corrective physical education,
individual physical education or phy-
sical education and recreation for the
atypical are required in every profes-
sional curriculum that I have known.
Such courses survey certain physical,
social and mental defects which the
teacher or leader may find in the school
or recreation center. The courses aim,
further, to plan diversified programs
of adapted sports, adapted games,
adaptations in dancing and swimming
to meet the needs of those who are
disabled or limited in abilities.

The article, however, does pose a
challenge in the preparation of leaders
in recreation for the handicapped, and
that is: the need for more practice and
eXperience in actual situations. Stu-
dent experience in recreation programs
in hospitals and schools for the handi-
capped would solve the problem so
strongly and ably stated by the authors.

Recreation for the Atypical, State

The School and Community Recrea-
tion Department of Newark, New Jer-
scy, under the leadership of Peter C.
Fujarcyk, has developed an awards
plan which has successfully met some
of the usual objections to awards.

In this plan an awards bulletin is
issued each spring and fall at the close
of an intra-mural program in the ele-
mentary schools. Four upper classes
participate in a double round-robin
schedule, the roster of participants de-
termined by the class enrolhnent, both
boys and girls.

Instead of the old-fashioned award
of a felt banner for classroom display,
1thc mimeographed bulletin, with ap-
propriate cover and congratulatory
foreword from the principal, tabulates

final standings for boys and girls with
a list of the championship teams in
each division. On another page com-
bined class honors appear.

Other pages list most-valuable-player
awards. The ten outstanding boys and
girls and the students receiving honor-
able mention are listed, selections de-
termined by a class poll.

' The class leaders’ page lists the
names of the boy and girl captains and
assistants for each class. The citation
pages provide an opportunity to honor
pupils who receive more than one
award. The AAA rating is given pupils
who are members of the championship
team, merit placement on the most val-
uable player poll, and have served suc-
cessfully as class leaders. The AA rat-

ing is granted to students who receive
any combination of the triple A rating.

The last page of the bulletin is re-
served for autographs—a popular pro-
vision.

The leaders who have developed the
bulletin plan are enthusiastic about its
success in increasing participation and
making possible recognition of the non-
star player. And now the lower grades
are showing interest in a modified ver-
sion of the round-robin schedule, with
their own bulletin to honor successful
participants.

It’s Fun To Be SAFE

James K. Williams

EACH YEAR accidents kill about
14,000 American children under
fifteen years of age. Countless thou-
sands are also seriously injured and
many are crippled for life.

If an epidemic of polio or even
measles strikes a community, we are
quick to mobilize all reserves to com-
bat the threat. Why isn’t the same true
for accidents? Perhaps accidents are
so common that we just take them for
granted.

Safety educators agree that much
hope for the future exists in the simple
statement, “It’s fun to be safe!” Rec-
reation leaders are in a position to play
an increasingly important role in this
fight for life.

A quick glance at some of the nor-
mal traits of young children, shows us
that the average youngster seeks ad-
venture and excitement.

The daring and often reckless char-
acters of history and television have
become heroes. Caution and personal
safety haven’t been presented to these
young minds in the same interesting
manner.

The cowboy who jumps from a sec-

MR. J AMES K. WILLIAMS is the executive

Safety education is best taught when habits are being learned and attitudes
developed. It must have the interest and support of all levels of leadership.

ond story window onto a waiting horse
looks good on a movie screen. Even
the buccaneer who recklessly wades in-
to battle with a knife between his teeth
represents high adventure.

We have to be honest and admit that
safety is a pretty dull subject compared
to all this. To make things worse,
safety is often preached in terms of
“do’s” and “don’ts” and even statistics.
This leaves the average person cold.

0n the brighter side of the picture,
however, the development of the con-
cept that “it’s fun to be safe” is a
challenge to every leader concerned
with recreation and leisure-time. The
idea that fun and safety go hand in
hand must be fostered. It isn’t easy to
put across this point, but neither is it
impossible. There are scveral basic
considerations that the recreation lead-
er bear in mind.

First, no amount of education, engi-

neering, or enforcement will eliminate
every hazard. We live in a complex
fast-moving world. Boys and girls
must learn to adjust to the hazards
which surround them evcry day.

Second, we can’t expect to put “old
heads on young shoulders.” The suf-
fering, heartaches, and tragedy caused
by accidents is not a personal problem
to the child. After all, not all adults
accept accident prevention as a person-
al responsibility. If, however, the lead-
ers whom children respect display a
serious attitude about safety, the
chances are the children will “catch”
some of this attitude.

You may ask, “How in the world can
safely be made interesting?” A few
ideas which may suggest others to the
person with imagination:

Sand box play provides an Opportu-
nity for children to build a city with
streets, houses and cars. Improvised

45

cross-walks, traffic lights, sidewalks and
even policemen directing traffic can in-
crease the child’s awareness of their
importance. '

Illustrated coloring books with stor-
ies about fire prevention are ideal as
an occasional quiet period activity.
Such. material is available from the
National Fire Protection Association.

The story hour can be used to insert
interesting safety messages. Such mes-
sages can be related to things the chil-
dren know and like, as for instance, in
a story about the knights of old, an
cxplanation can easily be added about
how the knight’s armor was to protect
him from dangers. The story teller can
then explain that we no longer have
armor to protect us from such dangers
as automobiles, but traffic lights serve
us as protection.

If space is available, a regular “Safe-
ty Town” may be set up on the play-
ground, complete with streets, inter-
sections, -and houses. Tricycles, bi-
cycles, pedal automobiles, and tractors
Al-
lowing children to take turns directing
traffic, and playing bus driver with the
realistic touch, can capture the imag-
ination of any youngster. (See page
262 in the October 1952 issue of REC-
neuron—Ed.)

The Bike Rodeo is an activity for
older children which stimulates pride
in riding skills, an attitude which is
important. Instruction in gobd bike

will make it even more realistic.

maintenance and safety rules might be
included. Boys and girls who have an
opportunity to display their skill in
such a way are less likely to show off
in traffic. A humorous sign about bike
safety on a playground bulletin board

can many times serve a good purpose,
such as “Clowns At A Circus Are

Funny As Heck—But Clowns On A
Bike Are A Pain In The Neck.”

Actually it isn’t difficult to plan in-
teresting activities along this line. The
secret of success is in the integrating
of safety education with many types of
activities. It isn’t even necessary that
the activity be identified as a safety in-
struction project; from the sand box
to nature lore there is a wealth of ma-
terial that can be used.

Films and visual aids are of great
assistance in presenting an interesting
safety program. Play Safe is an ex-

46

cellent film for children. Animated
characters such as the “Pushy Pig,”
the “Giddy Goose,” and the “Mock
Monkey” show the dangers of bad con-
duct on playground apparatus. Many
other safety films may be secured from
Young America Films, Coronet Films
and Encyclopedia Brittanica Films.
Complete information on all can be

obtained from the National Safety
Council, North Michigan Avenue, Chi-
cago, Illinois.

The last consideratioh that must be
kept in mind involves playground safe-
ty rules. It is a generally accepted
fact that young pe0ple who have an
opportunity for self-government are
less hostile to rules and regulations.

A playground safety council can be
a valuable aid to the playground super-
visor. Many playgrounds in Spring-
field, Massachusetts, have even a safety
patrol similar to school patrols. By
rotating the members of the patrol, a
large number of children share respon-
sibility for their playground safety.
Duties of the patrol vary from the su-
pervising of the bicycle racks, to the
instructing of young children in the
safe use of swings and playground ap-
paratus.

Any. discussion about accident pre-
vention is only as valuable as the ac-
tion program that results. It must havc
the intercst and support of all levels of
leadership. Safety education is only
one phase of the total program.

Accident records must be kept ac-
curately. Remember, the difference be-
tween a minor accident and a serious
accident is only a fraction of a second
or an inch. Records can show where,
how and when accidents are occurring.
A frequency is an immediate danger
signal.

Inspection of equipment and appa-
ratus is another essential part of the
program. Good maintenance is neces-
sary. Playground housekeeping must
be geared to eliminate the hazards of
broken glass, holes and rocks.

Some recreation leaders might claim
that they don’t need to include safety
education because they don’t have ac-
cidents. There are two answers to this.
One, a good past accident record is not
absolute insurance against possible ac-
cidents. One serious accident can de-
stroy months and sometimes years of

excellent public relations.

The second answer is by far the most
important. Safety is best taught when
habits are being learned and attitudes
developed. The safety training a young
child may receive on the playground
can influence his conduct on the street
and in thc home. It even projects into
later years when that child becomes a
driver of a high powered car. Skills
are easy to teach, but attitudes and
habits make the difference between
recklessness and caution.

If many of the 14,000 children killed
last year by accidents had received
better safety education, some would be
with us today. It has often been said
that we protect our wild life better than
our child life. In the past, there has
been some truth to this.

Recreation leaders can secure un-
limited help from such organizations
as local safety councils, the National
Safety Council, automobile clubs, in-
surance companies and many others.
It is only by joining hands that we can
wage an effective fight against child
accidents.

PAINT YOUR
PLAYGRHUND EQUIPMENT

A NUMBER OF YEARS ago a recreation director, wishing to
experiment, painted a swing in one of his parks red.

Then he took a count as to which piece of equipment was
used the most—the newly painted red swing or the other
ones in ust as good working order but with the traditional
metallic finish. The actual tabulation of results has been
lost, but anyone with a sense of appreciation for color
could guess what they were. . . .

Last spring a similar experiment, but far more exten-
sive,_ was made in the Greater Vallejo Recreation District.
ln this case all of the equipment on three playgrounds was
painted with many colors, giving a gay, circus atmosphere
to the children’s play areas. In one very large area, the
apparatus had gone without particular notice—in fact, the
entire park had been unnoticed and misused, but with the
change of color in the swings, slides, climbing bars, and
sand boxes to gay reds, oranges, blues, pink, yellow, lav-
ender and other bright colors, scores of pe0ple were at-
tracted. In each of these areas, use of the equipment was
increased hy the boys and girls.

We paint our homes, our fences, barns, machinery, out-
buildings, as a means of preserving, basically, but also for
the purpose of pleasing the eye. As for the playground
apparatus, however, we tend to leave it unattractive as to
color as long as its usefulness is maintained.

The following are examples of our use of color in areas
on which apparatus already was established:

Garbage cans: The can a solid color, the top still another
color.

Drinking fountains: The pipe and area under the bowl,
one color, the footstool for the smaller children, a different
color.

Sand boxes: Each side and brace a different color, the in-
side another color.

Ciant Stride: Red and white like a candy cane, with each
chain and handle yet another color.

Slides: Painted in sections—red, white and blue. Another
was painted with yellow sides and a blue bottom with red
braces.

Swings: Each brace at the end a different color; the pipe
area above the swing, the chains and the seat—yellow, red,
blue, green, white. .

 

KEITH A. MACDONALD is the executive director of the
Greater Vallejo Recreation District, Vallejo, California.

50

 

Picnic tables: Each board was painted differently. On an-
other, the top was painted one color, the seats another, the
braces a third.

Picnic benches: The backs one color, the seats another,
and the braces yet another.

Climbers: Each section a different color.

Turning bars: Painted the stand pipes one color and the
part most used aluminum.

Teeter-Totter: Each board a different color.

We found that parents living adjacent to the parks were
very much in favor of the painting. One lady stated, “You
improved the looks of the park and the neighborhood by
painting the equipment.”

Another said, “When my children saw the giant stride
painted like a candy cane they couldn’t wait to go over and
swing on it.”

Another mother said, as she passed the bright colorful
slide, “My, my, it knocks your eyes out, but I love it!”

Participation on all pieces of equipment has increased,
without question.

This treatment adds an item of maintenance, in that they
have to be repainted or touched up at least once a year.
Yet I firmly believe that the added cost of labor and paint
is well worth the time and money spent. We have used
Vitric Paint,* which has proven quite satisfactory. This
is a synthetic enamel which can be used on any metal
surface as long as the pipe is free from rust and grease.
Using a good primer such as zinc chromate, red lead, or
industrial grey, prior to painting, is advisable.

If each recreation director were to secure one pint each
of red, white, blue, yellow, orchid and green paint, a gallon
of thinner, three two-inch paint brushes, and some primer,
and try painting one piece of equipment, I’m certain that
he and the users would be most gratified with the results.

The safety color code introduced by the Dupont Com-
pany has been ad0pted by some schools. It is based on the
traditional association of colors for certain purposes. They
use but six colors: visibility yellow; alert orange; safety
green; fire protection red; precaution blue; traffic white.

Not only does painting make playground equipment
safer, but these attractive circus colors have an appeal to
children and will aid in enticing them to a playground area
in preference to playing in the dangerous street.

Sponsorship

While the official sponsorship in-
volving the executive direction and
business management rests with the
UCLA Department of Physical Educa-
tion and the Department of Special Ac-
tivities, University Extension, this in-
stitutc is, in truth, an institute staged
by and for the organizations which
represent the profession. The Univer-
sity of California simply possesses the
required staff and facilities to act as
host to such an event.

The original planners recognized
that the real value of any meeting such
as this comcs only when the rank and
filc leader actively shares in the plan-
ning and carrying out of those plans.
So, logically, local units of professional
groups and key agencies were invited
to participatc. Each cooperating group
appoints one member to an advisory
committec which formulates the gen-
eral policies, organizes the workshop,
selects key personnel, and in other
ways provides the framework for con-
ducting the institute. These groups also
encourage support and attendance at
the institute among their own mem-

Program

The Institute Advisory Committee
has selected for its 1953 theme “Re-
sponsibilities, Methods and Techniques
of the Professional Leader.” The work-
shop groups will explore the respon-
sibilities of the professional leader to
his patrons, employer, self, community
and profession. After identifying these
responsibilities the groups will turn
their discussions to the ways in which
they may be carricd out by leaders at
all levels in both public and private
agency situations. A final panel con-
sisting of the summarizcr from the
workshop groups will review the main
points discussed before the general as-
sembly. A permanent record of these
highlights will be printed in the Insti-
tute Proceedings, a thirty-page docu-
ment which is sent free to all delegates.

Progressive Recreation
Community

Chala Vista, California, is justly
proud of the recently passed $375,000
bond issue which will make possible a
fine recreation facility. A pool, long
enough to accommodate Olympic
events, U-shaped, with three diving
boards, and a gymnasium with seating
capacity of over one thousand persons,
equipped with courts, stage and kitchen
facilities, will be included in the new
sports center. Cooperation is responsi-
ble for bringing out the affirmative
vote. Door-to-door distribution of
printed hrochures hy members of civic
groups and teen-agers, news releases in
local papers, announccments enclosed
in bank statements, were used in the in-
formation-publicity campaign.

Extended Summer Season

A major project of the Park and Rec-
reation Commission, Amarillo, Texas,
for 1952 was the extension of their
playground season to cover a spring
and fall season. From May 1 to June
10, and from August 17 to September
30, programs were conducted on three
playgrounds and at Thompson Pool
from 4:00 to 10:00 P.M. Tuesday—
Friday; from 1:00 to 10:00 P.M.
Saturday; from 2:00 to 10:00 P.M.
Sunday. Total attendance at the spring
and fall seasons, of over fifty-four
thousand each, warranted the proposal
to cxtend the extra programs to at
least one more playground during this

season. Special events during both
seasons included movies, concerts,
square dances and softball. Skating

parties and tumbling events were added
in the spring, and hayrides, football
practice, a tennis tournament and fair
booth were planned during the fall
season. '

Playground leaders for the fall sea-
son were recruited, for the most part,
from personnel stationed at Amarillo

Volunteer News

One man and forty women were
graduated last month, in New York
City, from the first United Hospital
F und—sponsored course for hoSpital
recreation volunteers. The graduates
were assigned to twenty-two voluntary
hospitals, where they will serve as
recreational therapists for a minimum
of one hundred and fifty hours of their
spare time during the next year.

.Tllc Sports Picture in Italy

A magnificent $3,000,000 marble

stadium, one of the best in the world,
will open on May 17, in Rome, Italy,
with an international soccer game be-
tween Italy and Hungary. Situated in
the huge sports area known as “Foro
ItaIico,” on the right bank of the Tiber,
the stadium will accommodate 90,000
spectators, 650 newsmen in Special
glassed-in press booths equipped with
109 outside telephone lines, and 1,500
athletes using twenty-seven groups of
dressing rooms. The structure may be
vacath through sixty-two gates in
twelve minutes. The adjacent parking
lot can handle 12,000 cars.

If, when the International Olympic
Committee meets in Mexico City on
April 17, it should be decided that
Australia cannot accommodate the
games in 1956, Italy’s Olympic Com-
mittee will issue an invitation. If it is
not accepted for 1956, it will be ex-
tended for 1960. A $16,000,000 pro-
gram, now half completed, will insure
ample facilities for the exhibition. In
addition to the new stadium, these will
include two minor stadia—one the
famous “Marble Stadium,” two indoor
pools—one for diving, one for training,
an outdoor pool surrounded by 20,000
seats, tennis courts in an arena seating
10,000, two indoor sports structures
and an Olympic Village to house the
athletes.

Health Education

An experiment is being conducted in
Milwaukee. Don Dyer, director of recs
reation, with the approval of the Board
of Education, has instituted two courses
in sex education, under the leadership
of competent doctors, for teen-agers
and their parents. These courses—0n
different nights at different neighbor-
hood centers—are offered once a week.
for a ten-week period, for girls and
their mothers and boys and their
fathers. Neither the teen-ager nor the
parent can attend without the other.
If the courses prove to be popular, and

as the subject is not offered by the
public schools themselves, Mr. Dyer
hopes to continue them cach semesterI
during the spring and fall.

Another innovation is a course in
mental health, offered during the
semester which began in February, for
adults and young married couples.

Safety in Kite Flying

The Department of Water and Power
in Los Angeles distributes attractive,
three-color posters to instructors, rec-4
reation directors and youth leaders,.
with a letter requesting cooperation
in restricting kite flying to open areas
or supervised playgrounds or school
grounds. The poster emphasizes theseI
three points:

Avoid flying kites near electric Iines.|

Never use wire or metallic string, and
never use metal parts on the kite.

If a kite gets caught in the wires,
do not try to free it yourself; call your
public utility and a lineman will take
it down.

‘ Including Requirements
and Recommendations

PROFESSIONAL RECREATION PEOPLE and laymen alike have
long considered community recreation a mass program.
In many cases this. was, and still is, true—that is, recreation
leaders presented conventional community programs on a
quantitative rather than qualitative basis. In recent years
the trend has been in the direction of a concept immedi-
ately concerned with individual needs, differences, and
interests. In Cortland, New York, the Youth Bureau Rec-
reation Commission has fostered a Spirit that has resulted
in constant progress toward the realization of this recent
concept.

During the 1952 summer program a simple card index
system was utilized on our playground areas. This unique
system incorporated three specific aspects of a planned
recreation program: registration of individuals who came
to the playgrounds, checking out of equipment, and pro-
curement of individual interest data.

Each supervised playground area was equipped with
two file boxes. The first of these was an alphabetical name
file. Every boy or girl coming to the playground and check-
ing out an item of equipment for the initial time had his
name recorded on a 3 inch by 5 inch registration card.
Included on this individual name card were: home address,
age, grade in school, school attended, and phone number.
On the reverse side of the individual name card were re-
corded the items that each particular individual checked
out from the equipment shack. Each succeeding time a
piece of equipment was utilized, the item was marked by a
check on the card. The reverse side of the individual’s
name card included not only the checking out and in of
equipment hut also participation of the individual in special
events and planned play activities. If a boy signed up for
the various field trips, swim days, or other special.events,
or enrolled in planned play activities such as crafts, these
too, were recorded on the individual’s card.

Thus, over the summer pcriod we compiled a personal
interest index of every individual who frequented the vari-
ous playgrounds. This data indicated whether an individ-
ual’s interest was centered on one or numerous activities.

MR. FOWLER is recreation director at Cortland, New York.

54

This pertinent information will be invaluable in formulat-
ing our future summer programs, encouraging the develop—
ment of the individual, and enriching the needed opportu-.
nities which are presented. The same card also provides
personal information which the trained playground leader
can utilize in his presentation of activities. A glance at thel
age and grade in school gives evidence to the trained leaderI
of the individual capabilities. These individual capabilities
directly influence the level of program planning. The
trained leader follows the philosophy, “where a particular'
individual is, that is where he starts.” For example, boys
or girls who appear narrow or centered in activity interestl
may be directed into other beneficial activities of a level
dictated by these known capabilities and interests. All in-l
formation on the name index card is vital. !

The equipment file was our check out system. In this
file we had 3 inch by 5 inch cards which were insertedl
vertically. On the top of each card was the name of an
item of equipment. When a boy arrived to check out a
basketball, his individual card was removed from the name
file, “basketball” was written on the reverse side of his card.
Upon duplicate use of any equipment item, it was simply
check-marked each time that specific item was employed
by the boy. By merely placing this boy’s individual namel
card in the equipment file behind the card labeled “basket-l
ball,” we knew the individual responsible for that item.l
His name card remained in the equipment file until the
basketball was returned. At that time his name card wasl
replaced in the name file.

After utilizing this system for only a single summer
season, John Moiseichik, the playground supervisor, and'
his trained staff had but one criticism. It was time consum-l
ing, as systems of this nature are. The numerous advan-.
tages compensated for this lone disadvantage. The loss of
time factor was instrumental in the formation of a Leaders’
Club on each supervised playground, thereby relieving the'
paid, trained leaders of certain duties incurred in the card

‘ On all play areas, a formal system was utilized in that
me memher of the club was always on duty at the play-
gound building for the purpose of operating the check
ystem. This method proved to be the most eflicient be-
;ause duties and reSponsibilities were clearly defined. The
sense of responsibility and social contact involved seemed
 appeal, for each play area had sufficient leadcrs so that
go member of the club was required to perform the func-
Lbn longer than one hour a day. Rotation systems were
liganized, and boys and girls were actively c00perating

_ The entire unit is made 11p of three pieces of canvas.
Two pieccs are 50 feet long and 6 feet wide, the other is 15

in achieving a community recreation program which meets
individual needs and interests.

It gave us a control of issue equipment which restricted
the possibility of misuse or loss. At the same time an
indication of wear and tear on equipment was established
by frequency of use, thus, enabling playground leaders to
determine replacement needs to a finer degree.

The Leaders’ Club innovation was necessary for maxi-
mum benefit from the employed trained staff. It is also es-
sential for develoPing youth leaders who can be utilized
by other agencies operating in allied fields.

The system itself is conducive to the progress of the
conventional community recreation program which strives
to achieve the ultimate objective of a qualitative program
as well as quantitative one.

 

the t0p of each stake there has been inscrtcd and welded
a 1[cg-inch, 6-inch-long bolt. This bolt fits the grommet but
does not permit the canvas to slip further than to the end
of the 34-inch conduit. ,

The dressing rooms that are shown in the drawing are
made by inserting the poles at the proper distance and fold-
ing the canvas around them.

In Hammond, Indiana, the problem of forcing the 3/1,-
inch poles into the ground is no problem because of the
sandy condition of our soil. In localities where there is a
more compact soil, arrangements should be made to drive
the poles into the ground by means of a sledge hammer.

We have found this stage to be very satisfactory hecause
it can be put up in such a short time and dismantled in a
much shorter time. The moving of the materials is no
problem as the canvas can be folded and the poles can he
hauled in' any pick-up truck or station wagon.

all issues of the journal
put out by the Fayette-
ville (North Carolina)
Recreation and Parks
Department, and is used
as a mascot in connec-

 

tion with the various
activities they sponsor. This little char-
acter was created to symbolize recrea-
tion, and to represent the children
served. Why not adopt one of your
own, and make it familiar to citizens of
your community?

Tips from Reports

0 In Pocatello, Idaho, the police de-
partmenticooperates with the recreation
department by delivering youngsters to
the playgrounds when they find them
playing in the streets.

0 On New Orleans, Louisiana, play-
grounds they have good luck with the
old tried and true “balloon contest.”
This is always a spectacular event
which attracts public attention. Each
child receives a balloon filled with gas
and attached to a postcard on which
is written the child’s name and ad-
dress. Ballons are set free at a desig-
nated hour, and those with cards re-
turned from farthest distances receive
prizes. They report that seven hundred
gas filled ballons, with string and post-
cards, have been costing $19.75.

0 In Fayetteville, North Carolina, an-
other excellent idea is the provision of
better picnic areas for family groups.
The recreation department has opened
one of these in a downtown park for
business girls who wish to have their
lunch there.
for making hot coffee. This has been
a great success.

the Playmobile. This is a trailer with per—
manently installed baby swings, sand box
and carnival-canOpy, with movable equip-
ment for crafts, games, sports. Pulled by a
tractor, the Playmobile makes two steps a
day for eight weeks. Forest Gustafson, su-
perintendent of recreation, writes further:
“The Playmobile consists of a low frame
trailer fifteen feet by forty feet. The Lions
Club paid $1,500 and also secured the loan
of tractor. The Department of Parks and
Recreation equipped the trailer at a cost of
$1,500 and provided two leaders to supervise
activities. Ten sites were selected in con-
gested areas of the city; some of these lo-
cations were on small school grounds, others
were in the street. Where street locations
were selected, arrangements were made with
the Police Department for proper safety con-
trol during the periods of play.”

A Look at the Picture in 1952

Leadership continued to be the num-
:r one problem and concern of many
ties. More extensive recruiting was
irried on in an earnest attempt to se-
me and maintain high standards in a
:riod of personnel shortage. Recrea-
3n positions are being defined more
early and cxtensively with increas-
g evidcnce that selection is receiving
Twelve thou-
.nd copies of a new recruiting bro-
turc, Recreation A New Profession in
Changing World were sent out upon
'quest during 1952, reflecting new
1d intreased recruiting activity.
Although salaries continued to show
creases, they have not caught up
ith the increased cost of living. Also
1e rate of increase has been greater
l other professions which has made
llary one of the most diflicult prob-
ms in the attracting and placing of
ualified workers.

ore careful attention.

The placement of executives, as in
rcceding years, was most active in the
naller cities. Ninety per cent of the
lp executive positions filled in 1952
crc in cities under 50,000 pOpula-
on; seventy per cent were in cities
nder 25,000; fifty-seven per cent in
)mmunities under 15,000 population
nd forty-three per cent were in cities
nder 10,000 population.

The salary range for executive place-
tents was $3,000-310,000. Positions
1 some of the larger cities turned over
)r the first time in several years, in-
uding Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and
lakland, California.

Training programs increased as re-
ected in the number of institutes,
'orkshops, and conferences as a part
f in-service training. Likewise, pro-
essional recreation curriculums at col-
'ges and universities were improved
nd the number of scholarships, fellow-
hips, and interships increased.

ng needs in the southern region is

for the southern states. The regional
approach to professional education
which is being used by the Southern
Regional Education Board should in-
fluence the quality as well as equalize
other opportunities for training on a
geographical basis for both White and
Negro students.

Another important development in
1952 was the appointment of the Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Person-
nel to work with the Association. Re-
ports of five major subcommittees have
been appearing in RECREATION.

Watercycles

Small pleasure craft which pedal and
steer just like a bicycle and are built
for use on lake, pond or pool are the
Watercycles. According to their man-

 

ufacturer, simplicity and dependability
of design and quality construction en-
sure ease of operation, safety, seawor-
thiness, and years of usefulness with
minimum maintenance. Stable, non-
sinkable and swamp-proof, they are
streamlined to ride over waves easily
and are exceptionally maneuverable.
There are no exposed parts to endanger
smmmers.

Watercycles are available in three
different sizes: the junior model for
children up to eight years old; the
senior model for older children, teen-
agers and adults; and the companion
model for two riders. For information
write to The Selleck Watercycle Com-
pany, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida.

Plastic Floor Finish

A new transparent plastic floor fin-
ish which produces a non-slippery,
long-lasting finish has been announced

by the manufacturer. Called Skid-Not,

the new product is a colorless liquid
which is reputed to form an attractive,
semi-gloss, non-glare finish that lasts
three to four times as long as wax and
eliminates the necessity for frequent
revarnishing. It can be applied over
varnished or enameled wood, rubber
or asphalt tile, cork, terrazo or magne-
site floors.

Dem ountable Pier

The Hussey Manufacturing Com-
pany has announced the addition of a
new, improved steel landing pier to
their line of watersports equipment.

Built in demountable sections, the
pier can be erected and taken down
quickly and easily without skilled help.
Storage in small space is possible when
pier is disassembled. The vertical steel
supports are adjustable at both t0p
and bottom to allow for unevenness of
the bottom and the rise and fall of
water during the season.

 

Sections are so designed that any
length or any shape pier desired is
available. Additional sections may be
added at any time, and a diving board
may be installed without affecting the
stability of the pier.

A water Sports catalogue, giving
complete details of the pier and other
equipment, is available on request from
the Hussey Manufacturing Company,

5316 Railroad Avenue, North Berwick,

Maine. .

Institutes in Wisconsin

Plans are now under way for two in-
titutes to be held in June at the Uni-
ersity of Wisconsin’s Camp Upham,
t Wisconsin Dells, sponsored by the
niversity’s recreation curriculum. The
Lrst will be a three-day leaders’ insti-
ute for municipal and school employ-
es who conduct summer recreational
:rograms on a seasonal basis; and the
econd will be a week-long gathering
or prospective teachers and recreation
aaders, in which the natural environ-
"tent of the camp will furnish both the
.lace and materials of learning.

Drama in Ohio

The second season of Shakespeare-
Lnder~the-Stars, presented by the An-
ioch Area Theatre this summer, will
erve as the prologue to the events of
lntioch College’s centennial year, to
be observed in 195_3-54. Eight plays-—
he Creco-Roman Chronicles——will be
taged, in general as were the seven
ihronicles of the Kings in last year’s
ummer-long Shakespearean festival,
vhich was so widely acclaimed. It is
toped that an educational symposium
in Shakespeare, which may be of inter-
'st to teachers, will be held during the
presentation of the plays.

Exciting Experiments Afoot

Antioch has acquired a foundry
)uilding, on the edge of the campus,
vhich will be remodeled to provide the
:ollege with an assembly hall and to
louse the Antioch Area Theatre. An
ngenious, flexible plan for the physical
trrangements of the auditorium has
)een developed by the theatre staff,
vith architects and college authorities.

Seats will be mounted in movable
groups on specially designed platforms
1f various heights. An overhead foun-
lry crane will shift the platforms and

stage units quickly, making it possible
to arrange any desired setting for au-
diences of 200 to 1,350 persons. In ad-
dition to exciting possibilities for the
theatre, the plan will allow the college
to eXperiment with large audience situ-
ations in its educational program.

After 5. I. U.-——What?

In the spring, a student’s fancy
lightly  turns to thoughts of a ca-
reer (our apologies to Alfred Lord
Tennyson), and students of Southern.
Illinois University were given an op-
portunity to do something about it on
February 10 and 11. The Southern’s
Second Career Conference, during
which more than fifty sessions were
conducted, was held on the campus.
The session on Recreation' and Group

Work was conducted by Robert L. Hor-
ney, NRA Great Lakes district field

representative. Opportunities in the
recreation field were discussed from the
standpoint of the importance of rec-
reation as a profession, the nature and
conditions of the work, methods of re-
cruitment, requirements, general ad-
vantages and disadvantages and re-
wards.

Within a short time, the universityis
planning to start the development of a
campus picnic and recreation area near
the present campus for the use of

students.

Southern Visit

Another of the National Recreation
Association’s representatives, W. C.
Sutherland, visited the University of
Kentucky during the last week in Feb-
ruary, upon the invitation of Dr. Earl
Kaufiman, director of the recreation
curriculum. Mr. Sutherland, who is in
charge of the NRA Personnel Division,
conferred with fourteen recreation ma-
jors concerning their future careers.

ireative Dramatics for Children

Frances Caldwell Durland. The An-
;ch Press, Yellow Springs, Ohio. Pp.
:1. Paper $1.50, cloth $2.75.

A few weeks ago, the Saturday Re-
am of Literature, in its section “S. R.
ms to the Movies,” made the per-
lent statement that there is a vast
flerence in the European and Ameri-
11 child actor. The criticism was
.inted not at the child himself but at
s directors (especially the Hollywood
riety) who visualize the child’s mind
rough their own adult mental proces-
s. The way in which a child ex-
csses his own natural childlike ideas
Itl responses may be very different
om that of the directors which the
llld actor must accept and adapt.
This point of view is significant be-
usc this reference was made to the
ofessional child actor. It is interest-
g. therefore, that Mrs. Durland ex-
esses the same idea in her manual
I creative drama, which recognizes
e dramatic power of any child.
Because, generally speaking, adults
n rarely place themselves in the im-
;ination of the child, or understand
s thought processes, or appreciate his
nsc of humor, we need a body of
ills, techniques, a philosophy and a
sion wherehy to lead every child into
rclease of his imaginative emotional
nvers, and a creative deve10pment of
s own personality. °
Those pcrsons already working in
9 area of drama creatively conceived
ill hc grateful to Mrs. Durland for
tr help in showing a bit more clearly
c “how” of such development.

The question does arise, however, as
how practical this manual would be
the uninitiated. This reviewer tried
read with such persons in mind.
erhaps the answer is, that since this
anual developed out of class experi-
1ces and group research, a prospective
ader should first take a course—even
brief one, in necessary skills and tech-
.ques. The manual would then be in-
aluahle to teacher or leader. This is

Will. 1953

new Publications

Covering the

Leisure-ti me Field

in no way an adverse criticism of the
manual itself, but rather an awareness
of the power which must be inherent in
such a leader, the skills which must be
utilized and the values 'which should
result.

Notwithstanding the above state-
ment, here are some chapters which
may serve any teacher or leader, even
the beginner. “Source Material for
Creative Dramatics,” “Technique of
the Story Drama,” “Suitable Dramatic
Material.” “Analysis of Stories”—
Chapter VIII—will serve to make any
creative activity of greater value.

In addition, the author has rendered
a very real service in the chapters
“Creative Directing” and “Specific Re-
hearsal Prohlems.” If the teacher or
leader working, even in the area of
more formal dramatics, will study and
follow these two chapters much of the
unimaginative directing on high school
and adult levels will be eliminated.

I would suggest that any person de-
siring to 'broaden his skill in teaching
or direction, or to enlarge his vision of
the true meaning of the creativeness in
drama, would do well to include this
hook in his library.———Grace Walker,

ing Specialist, National Recreation As-

Animals Under Your Feet

lvah Green. Grosset and Dunlap,
New York 10. Pp. 129. $2.75.

This delightful new kind of nature
book for youngsters tells the real-life
stories of seventeen different animals
whose homes are underground and who
are literally living right undcr your
feet! lts author, formerly a teacher
of reading, literature and music in the
middle grades, has also taught college
courses in education and children’s
literature. She not only knows chil-
dren, but how to tell a story. Some of
the animals that she describes are the
gopher, woodchuck, mole, and such
small creatures as bats, crickets and
worms. Chaptcr titles are intriguing,
such as “An Upside-down Sleeper,”
“Beware the Trap Door,” “Groceries
Under the Bed,” “We Ride the Wind,”

sketches make the book appealing.

The Junior Book of Insects

Edwin Way Teale. E. P. Dutton and
Company, Incorporated, New York 10.
Pp. 249. $3.75.

This is a seventh and revised edition
of a successful hook on this ever-fasci-
nating subject, in which little has heen
changed, but to which a number of
things have been added. As Mr. Teale
points out, “The ways of insects alter
little; it is our knowledge of them that
continues to eXpand.” If you have
missed this in the past, be sure to add
it to your library now, for you will
find it filled with invaluable suggestions
for a playground, camping or nature
program, or for starting a new and
absorbing hobby. It includes instruc-
tions for the building of an ant house,
the keeping of bees, hunting with a
Hashlight, collecting with a camera,
the keeping of an insect zoo, and other
thrilling projects, as well as chapters
on various insects.

This excellent presentation of the
various phases of a well-rounded pro-
gram of rhythmic activities, although
slanted toward elementary school teach-
ers, and designed as a'textbook for
college and university teaching courses,
should prove a boon to recreation lead-
ers as well. It is a combination of
teaching suggestions and material ar-
ranged in the order of increasing com-
plexity for maturing children. The ma-
terial is well presented, and includes
not only instructions for the rhythms
themselves with music, but carries sec-
tions on the principles and methods of
teaching, the selection of activities ac-
cording to the normal characteristics
of different age groups, and a discus-
sion of types of possihle accompani-
ment to rhythmic activities. Content
of a rhythm program for the .year is
broken down into three types of activi-
ties: fundamental rhythms, creative
rhythms, folk dances and singing
games. This material is not highly
technical and should be understand~
able to the non-specialist.

0-—

The spring and early summer months offer a galaxy of days and events to encourage a wide
variety of program planning. There are some holidays which are an occasion for gay decora-
tions and festivities—others which call for more scrious ohservances; days of historic signifi-
cance which should inspire good hulletin board displays, dramatic activities, quiz programs;
and days devoted to members of the family which can motivate a surge of gift making activity
in the craft shop. Don’t overlook a single opportunity to make—~and keep—your program alive

He Held On All Night

OUT OF THE SPRING NIGHT, the Red banzai
attack hit like a thunderstorm. The darkness
exploded into a nightmare. But Sergeant Wil-
son went into action at once, rallying his hard-
prcssed men.

Bullets disabled both his arms. Refusing aid,
he crawled, bleeding, from man to man, sup-
plying ammunition, directing fire, helping the
wounded.

As the attack grew ficrcer, a mortar shell
blcw him off his feet. Still, dazed and weak-
cned, he held on, leading the fight all night till
the last Red assault was beaten off. At dawn,
by sheer courage, the Sergeant had saved not
only his position, but the precious lives of his
men.

“In Korea,” says Sergeant Wilson, “I didn’t

just thanked God they were there.

“Now, back home, I realize what’s behind
those arms. The united strcngth of millions of
thrifty, hard-working folks like you—who are
making America safcr by investing in United
States Defense Bonds.”

If you are self-employed, enroll in the plan—a sure
