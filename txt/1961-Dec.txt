Next Month

The excellent talk given at the 43rd
National Recreation Congress by Maj or
General Harold C. Donnelly will appear
under the title “Recreation for Today’s
Military Man.” It points out how to-
day’s military man differs from his pre-
war brothers and discusses his impor-
tant needs.

As we face responsibilities _for youth
in 1962, we will be going farther afield
from our recreation centers in an at-
tempt to reach “The Unacceptables.”
This is the title of an article by Ernest
Goranson, recreation consultant, Divi-
sion for Children and Youth for the
State of Wisconsin, in which he dis-
cusses the particularly strategic posi-
tion of the recreation worker to do
something about these young people.
And last, but not least, watch for the
special picture story, “A Documentary
on Physical Fitness in Recreation.” It
shows the amazing spread of recreation
activities which make (and have been
making) an actual, daily contribution
to the nation’s whole physical.fitness
picture.

Personnel

Sirs:

I read [ML Sutherland’s] article on
personnel, “From Bad to Worse,” in
the September issue. . . . At this point
1 too, am very discouraged. . . . Two
or three times in the last ten years I
thought we were beginning to win this
fight for adequate personnel but I be-
lieve that we are again losing ground
 ust as he seems to think.

Let’s face it. We are in the market
for the same type of professionally
trained people that the schools have.
Here in Dade County, Florida, we are
absolutely unable to compete. The
teachers have a powerful lobby in
Florida and in the nation as well. Their

salaries are constantly being upgraded:

and every time that we, in municipali-
ties, meet the same standards of salary
levels for our recreation people that
the schools have, the teachers get an-
other boost and we are again way be-
hind. This is added to the fact that
their hours are arranged so that they
can hold additional jobs, whereas our
workers cannot possibly do this, except
piecemeal, and it is generally contrary
to regulations to do outside work.
Again, the teachers can work during the
summer time and make additional
money which boosts their year’s total
earnings.

Here in Florida teachers are paid out
of county and state taxes, while the
municipalities have only municipal
taxes to rely upon. I am very happy
for the teachers but regret what is hap-
pening to the need for trained person-
nel in recreation.

Each recreation administrator should
ask himself, “Is a recreation profes-
sional of as much value to the com-
munity as a school teacher?” I need
not elaborate on this point but I think
it is well taken. Too many of us are
satished with poorly paid workers, feel-
ing they do not make as important a
contribution to our citizens as do teach-
ers.

Superintendent of Recreation, Miami

Airhouses

Sirs:

I am presently exploring the possi-
bilities of using airhouses in connection
with our outdoor swimming pools in
an attempt to extend our present three-
month program. Our outdoor swim-
ming pools are 50’-by-150’, exclusive of
deck area, and I am desirous of making
contact with any organization operat-
ing an existing airhouse of the size re-
quired for such a swimming pool. I
shall be very glad to hear from any
readers who have had experience with
similar installations of comparable size.

GEORGE T. BELL, Commissioner of
Parks and Recreation, Toronto, Can-
ada.

Gokarting

Sirs:

The November 1961 issue of RECREA-
TION arrived at my desk at the same
moment as did an account of a tenth
grade boy who, on October 23, was said
to be “recovering steadily” from burns
received October 7 in an accident in a
kart park. He is said to have been driv-
ing it when it overturned, pinned him
underneath, and caught fire. The boy
was burned from the waist down, as
well as suffering burns of both arms and

his head and face.

It wouldn’t have taken this impetus,
however, to write you and, speaking for
the Elementary School Section of the
National Safety Council, express strong
support and approval for the action in
regard to “karting” taken by the Na-
tional Congress of Parents and Teach-
ers. The Elementary School Section of
the National Safety Council, which is
composed of school peOple and others
interested in elementary education
throughout the United States, became
alarmed about the potential hazards of
karting in the summer of 1959. A re-
quest was made to the officials of the
National Safety Council to take a def-
inite stand on this question. As a result,
the Traliic Conference of the council
prepared [its] policy [opposing go-
karting], which was then immediately

RECREATION

adopted by every relevant conference
of the council.

You may be sure that the Elementarv
School Section heartily approves of the
forthright stand taken by the National
Congress of Parents and Teachers. As
a matter of fact, at its recent meeting
in Chicago, formal appreciation for the
action taken by this influential group
was expressed.

VIVIAN WEEDON, Sta}? Representa-
tive, Elementary School Section, Na-
tional Safety Council, Chicago.

'2!- i:- it it-

The disapproval of “gokart racing”
under legal age by the National Con-
gress of Parents and Teachers is, in my
opinion, a step backwards in the ma-
turation of our children. By citing the
two gokart deaths in Indiana, its presi-
dent, Mrs. Jenkins, I feel, is trying to
induce fear into the parents of our
American youth.

Gokart racing is a type of play rec-
reation, and we know that all types of
play involve both mental and physical
competition, whether it is the participa-
tion in the school spelling contest or just
a game of softball in the neighborhood.
Cokart racing involves these two types
of contest competition in one game that
is the direct benelit to the participant
in his maturity. In every game or con-
test there is a degree of chance that the
participant (in this case his parent or
guardian) must accept.

In the space age of today, it is the
responsibility of the parents of our
youth to accelerate their maturation of
both the body and mind. I approve of
under-age gokart racing for the purpose
of maturation. I recommend the book
on the study of the play culture by John
Huizinga entitled Homo Ludens as a
study on play.

ant to the Parish Program Director,

Keeping the Record Straight

Sirs:

I was extremely gratified to see Doris
Berryman’s article in your October
1961 issue. However, to keep the rec-
ord straight, may I suggest that your
readers be apprised that this was first
delivered as a paper at the first annual
Institute on Group Work and Recrea-
tion conducted by the NYC Association
for the Help of Retarded Children?

Teenage Achievers

Recreation service projects played a
prominent part in the Parents’ maga-
zine seventh annual Youth Group
Achievement Awards for outstanding
service to the community. Among the
198 groups singled out for honors were:
The Sorella Tri-Hi-Y Club of Chatham,
New Jersey, which, after special train-
ing from the New Jersey Association
for Retarded Children, set up a baby-
sitting service for handicapped children
in the area. In Elmhurst, Illinois, the
Tan-Da-Horizon Group sponsored a
Camp Fire Girls program for mentally
retarded girls, helping them to meet re-
quirements of Trailseeker, the first rank
in Camp Fire Girls. In Haverstraw,
New York, teens belonging to the Teen
Canteen set out to rebuild morale and
membership after the cancellation of a
teen recreation event because of vio-
lence. The youngsters opened their
club’s membership to create a commu-
nity-wide interracial organization and

increased membership to ninety-two,
made the group self-supporting, and
raised funds for recreation equipment
through a village carnival. Members of
the Merrill, Wisconsin, Youth Center
aired teen-age problems and their solu-
tions on a weekly radio program which
achieved such popularity it was spon-
sored by a national service organiza-
tion. Special recognition went to Boy
ScoutTroop 29 of Lake Leelanau, Mich-
igan, a winner for the past six years,
for its conservation projects and a tree
planting program.

Safety Leaders

More than seventeen hundred young-

sters in the Los Angeles area were feted.

last summer at the thirteenth annual
Safety Leaders Council Picnic, cospon—
sored by the Los Angeles City Recrea-
tion and Park Department and the Au-
tomobile Club of Southern California.
The youngsters helped recreation direc-
tors control safety factors at play areas

Tales Out of School

Spencer G. Shaw, storyteller and li-
brarian, offered some pointers on tell-
ing tales while serving as a visiting
professor this summer at the University
of Washington School of Librarianship.
He said that fathers should not over-
look the opportunity to tell their chil-
dren stories; this adds a new stature
to their role and an added companion-
ship. Parents should not deny imagina-
tive fiction to children in favor of scien-
tific and technical books, the storyteller
added. A child’s curiosity must be
nourished by a stretching of the mind.
Make use of poetry, he advised, let chil-
dren have a choice in the stories, don’t

 

The lVinner! President John F. Ken-

nedy received additional recognition
for his ability as a writer when he ac-
cepted a national journalism award in
a program sponsored jointly by the
American Machine and Foundry Com-
pany and the National Recreation As-
sociation. President Kennedy won his
$1,000 award ( donated to District of
Columbia youth agencies) for his ar-
ticle, “T he Soft American,” which ap-
peared in Sports Illustrated magazine.
Seen at the White House presentation
ceremony are, left to right, President
Kennedy; Morehead Patterson, chair-
man of the AMF board; and Joseph
Prendergast, NRA executive director.

ners ( including another Kennedy) see

Golden Anniversary

The Turkey Ridge Playground Moth-
ers Club of Cincinnati, Ohio, recently
celebrated its golden anniversary with
a luncheon. The Turkey Ridge Club,
founded in 1911, is the oldest existing
playground mothers’ club and has con-
tributed greatly to the playground
through donations of equipment, time,
effort, and funds.

Hitting a High Note

Over nine hundred opera lovers
jammed Dixon Hall in New Orleans to
listen to the recreation department’s
opera workshop presentation of Tosca.
The one-night event was the best at-
tended in the group’s history. Many
arias were interrupted by applause as

the audience showed happy approval
of the young amateurs’ efforts.

Teenage Preferences

In Washington, DC, a survey made

for the National Capital Area Health

and Welfare Council showed differ-

ences in leisure activities among young-

movies, attending sports events, pie-
nicking, dancing, and playing cards
than do their more monied peers. In
the high income group, tennis, golf, and
auto maintenance figured prominently.

Death Centence

A seal in the Woodland Park Zoo in
Seattle, Washington, was turned into
a live piggy bank by zoo visitors and
died of copper poisoning. AutOpsy dis-
closed a total of over two pounds of
quite indigestible coins, mostly pennies,
in the seal’s stomach. In addition, there
was a button, a metal washer, and six-
teen pebbles. Frank Vincenzi, zoo di-
rector, criticized zoo visitors who throw
foreign objects to the seals. If people

Conservation Data

A center for conservation data has
been established by the Denver Public
Library. The center is a national re-
pository of records in the field. Its es-
tablishment sprang from the research
work of Arthur H. Carhart, a conserva-
tionist and author, who for forty years
collected manuscripts, reports, diaries,
correspondence, photographs, and
books dealing with conservation. Three
years ago he began looking for a place
to assign his material and from a meet-
ing with John T. Eastlick, librarian for
the Denver Public Library, came the
beginnings of the conservation center.

T WAS FIFTY—FOUR YEARS AGO that
1 Ralph Adams Cram and his wife

set forth from their home in Bos-
ton on Christmas Eve, accompanied by
a group of friends, to sing Christmas
carols in the streets of their neighbor-
hood. Ml'. Cram was a distinguished
architect, the one chosen to redesign

the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in
New York City, and he was a particularly
conservative Bostonian. It is recorded
that carols had been sung in the streets
previously, but this was the first time
that they were so heard in the twentieth
century. At that time no one sang in
the streets other than those who did so
for a livelihood—street singers to whom
one tossed pennies. And so timid was
Mr. Cram that after a carol was sung
he and his group hurried away for fear
of being recognized.

This old Continental custom is now
a part of the life of Boston, and has
grown so that in 1937 a tally was taken
and it was estimated that seventy-five
thousand people participated in this
celebration on Beacon Hill, and so great
was the crowd that seventy-five police-
men were on duty to maintain order.

In the beginning, carolers went about
with oldfashioned lanterns hung on
sticks, as pictured on many Christmas
cards. At first only adults participated.
Later they brought children along, usu-
ally those under ten years of age, and
after they had sung, many householders
treated the little ones to Christmas
candy. Now people of all ages join in,
not only in singing the carols, but in

bellringing, which later was added to
the celebration. The affair is most in-
formal. There is no meeting place. One
group will pass another, or join with
a party and just trail along.

Mrs. Arthur A. Shurcliff, nationally
known as a promoter of handbell ring-
ing, was the instigator of this custom in
Boston. In 1932, she. started ringing
handbells in the streets with her chil-
dren. Now her grand-children are bell-

ringers on Beacon Hill on Christmas

Eve.

After the first bell-ringing of a carol,

people sang accompanied by the bells.

The idea caught on, and in later years
others joined, some of them expert bell-
ringers who could harmonize; but ama-
teurs were welcome, and if mistakes
were made, no one seemed to be dis-
turbed. Anyone who wished could join
1n.

MANY OF THE RESIDENTS of Beacon
Hill open up their homes to the
Christmas musicians and serve refresh-
ments. Frequently carolers and bell-
ringers will form a group around a
piano in an exclusive home in which
they had never set foot before, and the
householders join in with the singing of
Christmas music. The people of Beacon
Hill are not likely to open their homes
to anyone outside their own circle, but
on this one night the bars are down.

The residents of Beacon Hill were-so
entranced by the carolers and bellring-
ers that gradually they started to put,
lighted candles in their windows, as an
invitation for the musicians to stop be-
fore their homes with their Christmas
melodies. The first candle was lighted -
by the Reverend D. K. Shurtlett in 1893.
Horace Morrison was the first one on
Beacon Hill to have his home illumi-
nated by electricity. But on Christmas
Eve he had his windows lighted by can-
dles from the top of his house to the
bottom. Some of the Beacon Hill dwell-
ers used candelabras. Others were in-
spired to place beautiful wooden Ma-
donnas and Della Robbia creches from
Spain and Italy in their windows with

lighted candles before them.

IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, the people
have a similar celebration the Sun-
day night before Christmas. There,
Christmas candles are held in the hands
of nearly one hundred thousand people,
all of whom come to sing the old famil-
iar carols of peace on earth, good will
toward men.

The spirit of Christmas is indeed
strengthened by the joyous ringing of
bells on a sparkling Christmas Eve
night, and the raising ofvoices in carols,
while thousands of candles cast their
gleams on those who believe fervently
in the birth of the Christ Child. On
that night, Beacon Hill wears a necklace
of jewelled lights, and the old familiar
strains of carols sound sweetly on the
air. Bells ring softly; snow crunches
crisply underfoot; and all this beauty
is crowded within the hearts of those
who have the spiritual impulse to join
in the celebration on Beacon Hill. 1:}:

or]: City have taken steps to reserve
ealty for parks and recreation needs.
overnor Farris Bryant has called a
alt to the continuing sale of nearly
fty thousand acres of state-owned land

nd proposes to set it aside for public
ecreation uses.

I"'I'ilVIayor Robert F. Wagner has in-
-- ructed the New York City Planning
Cammission to make certain that city-
owned land will not be put up for pri-
rate sale if there is any likelihood that
he city will ever need it. Such land,
ays the recently re-elected mayor,
hould go into a proposed municipal

I

pll-azas, squares, landscaped spots and
sitting places. New York City is also
moving to take advantage of the recent
federal legislation providing grants of
twenty to thirty percent of the cost of
acguiring land for park and recreation
pu poses in urban areas.

} THREE VETERAN PARK MEN have been
named assistant directors in the Wash-
ington office of the National Park Serv-
ice in an effort to strengthen the organ-
izational structure of the service to meet
the rapidly increasing needs for parks

.and recreation areas. Manning the new

posts are Daniel B. Beard, Ben H.

dent.

F CIVIC LEADER Charles Weissmann of
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, former

ground and Recreation Association,
died recently at the age of seventy-three.
He was the founder and former presi-
dent and chairman of a chain of auto-

prominent in many civic activities and
had been honored by a number of vet-
erans’ groups for his contributions to
the welfare of men who had been in the

} Two LAY LEADERS in parks and rec-
reation in the State of Washington were
honored recently by the Washington
State Recreation Society: Druggist
John R. Vibber of Kennewick has long
made parks and recreation his avoca-
tion. He was a member of the Kenne-
wick City Council’s parks committees
when voters approved a $35,000 bond
issue for a municipal swimming pool in
1952 and has been a member Of the
Benton County Park Board since it be-
gan in 1950. Also cited was Mrs. James
F. Stewart of Tacoma, who has been a
member of the Tacoma Metropolitan
Park District’s Board of Park Commis-
sioners for nine years and has played a
leading part in five successful park and
recreation bond campaigns.

t RECREATION IS ITS BUSINESS, too, the
federal Bureau of Land Management
has come to realize. The bureau’s re-
cent decision to “think recreation” was
announced by its director, Karl S.
Landstrom at the annual meeting of the
National Grazing Advisory Board. He
reported that, although construction of
campgrounds was already under way on
bureau lands in Oregon, the agency
faces a considerable task in attempting
formal provision for recreation seekers
on the public properties under its juris-

diction due to lack of personnel and
funds.

of Recreation and Park Lands and W a-
ters, conducted by a national commit-
tee, has just been published under the
title The Loss of Park and Recreation
Land—Where We Stand and What to
Do About It. Reports submitted by 130
local and county park and recreation
authorities indicated a total of 2.687
acres lost at 259 of the 267 areas at
which encroachments had been re-
corded. The policy statement included
in this publication offers every commu-
nity a pattern for building a sound land
protection and acquisition schedule into
a community’s priority program for
growth and expansion.

The survey was made by a joint com-
mittee of the American Institute of Park

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

F THE TREND TO AUTOMATION is of
greatest concern to the economist and
politician, declared Sir Hugh Taylor at
the eleventh annual meeting of the Na-
tional Council on the Aging. Sir Hugh,
who is dean emeritus of Princeton Uni-
versity’s Graduate School and president
of the Woodrow Wilson National Fel-
lowship Foundation, envisages a “three-
day working week with two shifts for
continuously operating processes” en-
gendering a need for “upgrading the
opportunities for profitable use of lei-
sure time.”

F WANT TO SET UP an effective boating
education program? The Outboard
Boating Club of America is now making
available to recreation directors, free of
charge, outlines and materials for a
three-lesson course in the skills of boat-
ing, adaptable to either dock-side or in-
door presentation. The course kit con-
sists of an instructor’s manual, scripts,
posters, and materials on legal and
safety requirements. A thirty-two page
illustrated booklet to serve as a text for
students, color motion pictures empha-
sizing teaching points, and other sup-
plementary materials are also available
free of charge. Write to the OBC at 307
North Michigan Avenue, Chicago 1.

F TIPS ON TAKING PICTURES and enter-
ing the 1962 Kodak High School Photo
Awards are now available without
charge to teenage photographers. The
material includes Contest Clues, an il-
lustrated leaflet featuring a variety of
suggestions for photographic subjects
as well as techniques; the rules folder
for entering the 1962 ‘Awards which
open January 1; and the catalog of
prize-winning prints from the 1961
competition (one of the prize-winners
appeared on the cover of RECREATION,
October 1961). Write to Kodak High

School Photo Awards, Rochester 4, New
YOrk.

F SOCIAL DYNAMITE is building up in
our large cities in the form of unem-
ployed out-of-school youth, according
to the latest Conant “report.” In his re-
cent book, Slums and Suburbs, Dr.
James B. Conant also declares, “Big
cities need decentralization in order to
bring the schools closer to the needs of

the people in each neighborhood and to
make each school fit the local situation.”

F FOLLOW-UP on the resolutions adopt-
ed at the 1960 White House Conference
on Youth are reported in the bi-monthly
F allow up Reporter, which is available
upon request. The Reporter gives a
state-by-state report on action taken.

F THE HIGH COST OF ROADSIDE LITTER
is approaching the $2,000,000 mark in
California, according to H. N. Bos-
worth, associate landscape architect in
the state Department of Public Works.
Roadside cleanup expenditures have
risen from $1,000,000 in 1958-59 to $1,-
444,586 in 1959-60 and will approach
the $1,750,000 for 1960-61.

F ART IN EDUCATION, rehabilitation and
psychotherapy constitutes the subject
matter of a new quarterly, the Art Ther-
apy Bulletin, whose first issue has just
appeared. Editor Elinor Ulman is art
therapist at the District of Columbia
General Hospital and a member of the
faculty of the Washington School of
Psychiatry. Address: 634 A Street, SE,
Washington 3, DC. Single copies,
$1.00, annual subscription $3.00.

F LICENSED HUNTERS totaled almost
twelve million last year. The US. De-
partment of the Interior reports that
11,785,753 hunters in forty-six states
purchased one or more licenses to hunt
in 1960. While the number of licensed
hunters is large, it cannot accurately re-
flect the total number of persons who
hunt because many are not required to
purchase a license. According to figures
recently released from the 1960 Na-
tional Survey of Fishing and Hunting
by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and
Wildlife, there were 14,637,000 hunters
in the United States during 1960, of
whom 11,878,000 were licensed. The
$60,981,203 outlay for hunting licenses,
stamps, tags, and permits required by
state fish and game departments was
$3,170,000 more than the $57,811,192
spent in 1959.

F Comeback: The Story of a Handi-
capped Boy’s Return to the Mainstream
of Life, a new 28-minute, 16MM sound
film, in technicolor, on therapeutic rec-
reation is now available to professional
and lay groups through Comeback, Inc.,
16 West 46th Street, New York 36. It

shows how therapeutic recreation can
contribute to the rehabilitation process.

F AN ECUMENOPOLIS, or universal city,
will engirdle the eaIih within a hundred
years, predicted Dr. Constantine A.
Doxiadis, architect and city planner
from Athens, Greece, in address to the
National Association of Housing and
Redevelopment. The ecumenOpolis is
now being created out of several chains
of connected urban settlements- growing
simultaneously, such as the area from
Boston south to Washington, DC.

F FOR BETTER MENTAL HEALTH this
country needs more parks, bowling al-
leys, shooting galleries, and better city
planning, says noted psychiatrist Dr.
Karl A. Menninger, chief of staff of the
Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan-
sas. Speaking at the annual convention
of the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion in Chicago, Dr. Menninger stated,
“In my opinion, we must add [to the]
proximity of cities larger wilderness or
near-wilderness areas as essential to the

mental health of both child and adult.”

MEETINGS

F THE 1962 NATIONAL CONVENTION of
the American Camping Association will

be held at the Statler-Hilton Hotel, New
York City, March 6-10, 1962.

F MORE WATER FOR WATER SPORTS will
be subject of the second annual confer-

ence on Opening the Way to Water, to

be held March 6-7, 1962, during the
Chicago National Boat Show at 'Mc-
Cormick Place. The conference will be
sponsored jointly by the Outboard
Boating Club of America and the Sport
Fishing Institute.

Aquatic Forum offers opportunities to
improve teaching techniques, swim-
ming skills, and general aquatic abili-
ties. The date: December 23-30. The
place: Shamrock Isle Hotel and Cabana
Club, Bal Harbour, Florida.

 

A WIDER PERSPECTIVE

. . . In my mind the primary values in recreation have to do with the broad-
ening of the understanding of the world we live in. This is essentlally an
educational process and covers all fields of interest other than the partlcular
interest which is associated with a man’s job. For the individual, the Ob-
jective should be to stimulate interest in all of the so-called cultural fields:
music, arts, literature, politics, international affairs, every type of thing
which will promote a wider perspective on life.

Most adult recreation also involves the family unit and the training of
the younger generation in learning more about life. This would range from
sports to the study of natural history and all other phases which ordinarily
are only appreciated in later years. I think the objectives of [recreation]
should be directed toward the stimulation of interests in all of these areas. . . .

MY. PHILOSOPHY 0F RECREA TION

6‘ I a c 0
We must examine our professuon with a fearless mind”

Sal J. Prezioso

RECREATION should be measured by
what it does for people and the
community. The primary concern of all
recreation leaders should be: How Are
People Using Their Free Time? It is
our responsibility, as recreation leaders,
to continually explore and expose the
talents, habits, attitudes, needs, and in-
terests of people. It is essential that we do so in order to
properly determine the type of activities and facilities to
be sponsored and administered. Unfortunately, many of our
leaders are primarily concerned with providing a “smorgas-
bord of activities” without regard to quality and purpose.
Recreation philosophy is almost meaningless not only to
citizens in general but to many of the recreation leaders for
whom it is intended. People are not aware of what recrea-
tion does or is doing—neither do they care. All they want
is fun and relaxation. The byproducts are for the profes-
sionals to worry about. In any successful enterprise there
must be a guiding philosophy behind actual day-to-day op-
erations. This is especially so in recreation; without it our
programs are worthless.

 

If we were to ask ourselves the question, “What do peo-
ple want out of life?” I would venture to say that the answer
generally would be, “Health, happiness, prosperity, love,
and an opportunity to serve and contribute to the general
welfare of our families and communities.”

Religion, education, recreation, and work together make
up the greater components of life. Aside from the many
general byproducts that accrue from recreation—such as
health and happiness, satisfaction, relaxation, and renewed
spirit—it is my sincere belief that recreation, if properly
administered, can shape the lives and personalities of peo-
ple; that it provides Opportunities for self-expression and
leadership; and that it is the best laboratory and tool in
this democracy of ours to better group relations and com-
munity welfare. Recreation helps people find themselves
and adjust to life situations. Recreation, through its varied
programs and social relationships, can well assist in min-
imizing fears and finding answers. Bringing people together
from all walks of life, in various recreation settings, provides
the framework for meeting the future with greater confi-

dence.

As we explore the happenings of the last decade or two

of living, we find that our population is different. Its age
has changed and so have the needs, interests, habits and

attitudes of the people. Two age groups—the very young
and the very old—are growing more rapidly than the rest
of the population. These are precisely the age groups which
should be consuming the largest share of our attention. Un-
fortunately, many of us are behind the times in this regard.

More than this, the very texture of our society is different
today than a decade ago and it will continually change. Our
cities are growing. By 1970, almost three-fourths of us will
be living in sprawling complexes of city and suburb. The
supercity will strain the political and administrative ma-
chinery designed for bygone days of the rural majority.
It poses complicated problems for recreation in terms of
patterns of service.

OUR VERY DESIGN of living has changed in the last two

decades, and will continue to change. The family econ-
omy will be different; its members better educated and more
aware, among other things, of the values of recreation. Their
expectations will be higher, including adequate and appro-
priate recreation on the list of basic rights.

Within the recreation profession itself there have been,
and will continue to be, changes no less profound than those
in the world around us. We must examine our profession
with a fearless mind; we must think critically, experiment
courageously, and change constructively to keep apace of
our fast-changing times.

A program of recreation can be measured best against
five criteria:

0 The aims and policies of the managing authorities.

0 The adequacy of the appropriation of funds.

0 The quality and adequacy of the professional stafI.

o The quality and adequacy of the recreation facilities pro-
vided, and

o The quality of programs.

The backbone of a recreation department is its profes-
sional stafi. A superior stafi creates a superior recreation
system, and a superior recreation system creates superior
recreation leaders. Herein lies the answer to the meeting
of the present and future needs of our society.

I believe that every citizen should have the Opportunity
to benefit from the creative aspects of recreation to the ex-
tent of his ability and participate in programs of a socially
accepted nature. Our programs must be purposeful and
meaningful and aimed toward not only developing the in-
dividual but contributing to the general welfare of our so-
ciety. This nation of ours will be a happier one, and better
prepared physically, mentally, and emotionally to face life's
situations with renewed confidence if we do the job re-

quired of us. #

Everything tended

in the national picture-—

ROM THE OPENING session Sunday
F evening to the closing session
Thursday morning, the 43rd Na-
tional Recreation Congress was packed
with people, ideas, information, and ac-
tivities. A spirit of serious application
and purpose, though typical of Recrea-
tion Congresses through the years,
seemed to be “bustin’ out all over”—

510

like June in the song from Carousel, the
Rodgers and Hammerstein production
put on by the Detroit Parks and Recrea-
tion Department on Tuesday evening.

Meetings, with pre-Congress excep-
tions, were held in fabulous Cobo Hall

.-—spacious new building along the De-

troit River—which could have accom-
modated several conventions at once,

with plenty of room for all. After dele-
gates found their way around, mapped
out the shortest distances between two
points, and abandoned city shoes for
loafers, it was wonderful. For the first
time in many years they were not trip-
ping over each other, and meetings
could spread out comfortably even
though attendance was larger than ever

RECREATION

before. The last total count was approx-

imately 2, 265 assorted recreation rep-
resentatives — professional leaders;
board and commission members; gov-
ernment representatives; recreation di-
rectors of the armed forces, hospitals,
churches, other public and private agen-
cies and institutions; exhibitors; wives;
and distinguished guests from other,
related fields.

The Congress this year was cospon-
sored by the National Recreation As-
sociation and the American Recreation
Society, with the cooperation of the
Detroit Department of Parks and Rec-
reation, the Recreation Association of
Michigan, and the Federation of Na-
tional Professional Organizations for

Recreation.

THROUGHOUT THE Congress there was
an awareness that the recreation
field is facing one of the greatest chal-
lenges of its existence—recreation in
relation to today’s new era of leisure
and quest for peace, and its implications
to the nation. Evident everywhere was
the earnest searching for the best pos-
sible ways of meeting this, and realiza-
tion of the seriousness of its responsi-
bilities in the changing national picture.

Speakers at the general sessions also
seemed strongly agreed on the growing

importance of recreation in the Ameri-
can picture, its inevitable influence on
the citizens of our nation. The new
leisure-recreation concept was ably out-
lined by Dan Dodson of New York Uni-
versity in his keynote challenge, “The
Dynamics of Programing,” at the spe-
cial session on Monday morning. It was
picked up and applied to a“ variety of
tOpics in succeeding sessions. “Can we
take this growing leisure and create a
civilization which will flower in greater
beauty and excellence than has ever
been dreamed?” he asked. (See REC-

REATION, November 1961, Pages 448,
455-6.)

THE WEEK STARTED with the opening

general session on Sunday evening,
with Joseph Prendergast, chairman of
the Congress Policy Committee, pre-
siding. Greetings were extended to all
delegates by the mayor of Detroit, the
Honorable Louis C. Miriani. Receipt of
the letter to the Congress from President
Kennedy was announced by Mr. Pren-
dergast. It said, in part, “It is signifi-
cant that you should be meeting at a
time referred to by Secretary of the In-
terior Stewart L. Udall as the ‘quiet
crisis.’ This administration is actively
leading a massive and sustained na-
tional conservation effort to save——while
there is yet time—the few remaining
extensive segments of our rapidly dis-
appearing shorelines and wilderness
areas. It is our purpose to encourage
state and local governments in the
timely acquisition of vitally needed
open space for parks and recreation
areasf’

Martin S. Hayden, editor of the De-
troit News, addressing the opening ses-
sion on the Congress theme, “Recrea-
tion in a Mobile America,” pointed out
the changes wrought in American so-
ciety of automation and mass produc-
tion, and said that recreation leaders
are “the vitamin pills of American life.”
He told them that their ob is one of en-
riching lives, strengthening bodies, and
stimulating minds.

THAT RECREATION LEADERS must face
up to their role in the shaping of
men’s leisure tastes, interests, and pur-
suits in a new era was voiced by 1' AW
Vice-President Leonard Woodcock,
speaking for UAW President Walter

Reuther. He said, in part, “We cannot
achieve full values of leisure in the same
country with a widening wasteland of
enforced idleness and abused or unused
economic potential. We can have more
time on our hands than we know what
to do with, and all that such a state of
affairs would imply for the national
character. . . . Or we can deliberately
seek the golden mean of material and
human resources wisely used both in
work and leisure, through both private
and public programs, toward the end of
improving the quality of our national
life and working purposefully toward
the ordering of a more sane peace and
a more harmonious world community.”

Donald J. Pizzimenti, American
Management Association lecturer and
personnel specialist for the Detroit Edi-
son Company, told the Congress that
good people are the key to good per-
formance and outlined techniques of
helping stafl develop their fullest po-
tential.

Sharing the honors as guest speakers
at other general sessions, were Secre-
tary Udall ( see RECREATION, November
1961); Dr. Theodore Forbes, director
of health, physical education and rec-
reation for the President’s Council on
Youth Fitness; and Dr. Donald P. Kent.
special assistant for aging, U.S. Depart-
ment of Health, Education and Welfare.
Dr. Forbes asked for more emphasis in
recreation programs on physical ac-
tivities and promised wholehearted na-
tional backing for any program of “fit-
ness through fun.”

Dr. Kent, speaking on “The Chal-
lenges of Leisure for the Aging Popu-
lation,” proposed a “National Volun-
tary Service Corps” to provide satisfy-
ing opportunities for older persons to
make themselves useful to the com-
munity—a sort of Youth Corps in re-
verse. He stated that after sixty-five,
most persons spend fourteen years in
retirement, and that these years should
be filled with self-reSpecting activities
to replace some of the values derived
from work—that is. usefulness. produc-
tivity and associations.

A surprise address given at the gen-
eral session on Wednesday by Governor
John B. Swainson of Michigan was wel-
come indeed. He told the inspiring story
of the broad objectives of Michigan’s
recreation policy (see RECREATION, '\’o-

511

vember 1961). “Recreation is a con-
tinuing governmental responsibility di-
rectly associated with the public wel-
fare,” he said. “As such, the adequacy,
quality, and continuity of the recrea-
tion programs and opportunities pro-
vided at all governmental levels should
be supported and advanced by profes-
sional leadership through use of public
and other supplemental funds made
available for public use.”

SPECIAL MEETINGS included a colorful

international meeting, “Play Is Fun
for Everyone Around the World,” or—
ganized by Dr. Elmer A. Scholer of the
State University of Iowa, with the as-
sistance of student advisors, which in-
cluded a lively demonstration of dances
from different lands. The demonstra-
tion workshop for recreation board and
commission members was noteworthy
for its fresh approach. This was organ-
ized and chaired by Dr. Frank L. Ok-
tavec of Wayne State University, De-
troit, and was a demonstration of a type
of workshop originally set, up by Dr.
Oktavec-and Clarence Brewer, retired
field representative of the National
Recreation Association, and tested over
a period of three years. It proved to be
very successful, and it has been sug-
gested that this pattern be followed at
the Congress another year.

Also worthy of special mention was
the meeting on “Communication: A
Two-Way Street,” planned and chaired
by Jay Ver Lee, superintendent of rec-
reation, Oakland, California. This
dealt with the establishing of prOper
channels for communication “from the
top-down, bottom-up, and outward.”
The “Dynamics of Programing in
Armed Forces Settings,” chaired by
Colonel Arden Lewis, Special Services
ofIicer, Headquarters, Sixth US. Army,
Presidio of San Francisco, had large
attendance, lively participation, excel-
lent speakers: Dr. Armond H. Seidler,
director of health, physical education
and recreation at the University of New
Mexico, Albuquerque; and Major Gen-
eral Harold C. Donnelly, commander,
Field Command, Defense Atomic Sup-
port Agency, Sandia Base, Albuquer-
que. 

The session on the “Dynamics of Pro-
graming in Therapeutic Settings,” was

addressed by Dr. Edith Ball, associate
512

professor, School of Education, New
York University; Dr. Thomas A. Petty,
clinical associate professor of psychia-
try, Wayne State University College of
Medicine; and Dr. H. Douglas Sessoms,
assistant chairman, recreation curricu-
lum, University of North Carolina.

The expellent demonstrations con-
ducted in the three-hour session on
“Recreation Arts and Crafts Program,”
chaired by Robert Banister, staff arts
and crafts director, Headquarters Fif-
teenth Air Force (SAC), March Air
Force Base, California, were
packed. They covered “Creative Cer-
amics” by Johnell Crimen, post crafts
director, Fort Bliss, Texas, and ‘Vir-
ginia Dudley, staff arts and crafts direc-
tor, Headquarters, Eighth Air Force
(SAC); “Creative Graphics” by Mr.
Banister, and Peter Walker, special field
representative, National Recreation As-
sociation; and “Creative Leather” by
Gordon West, staff crafts director, Spe-
cial Services Section, Headquarters,
Fourth United States Army, Fort Sani
Houston, Texas.

lilVERY RECREATION LEADER in the
country owed it to himself and

to his community to be present at the
Congress this year in order to re-
late his program and services to the
wider national picture and the tre-
mendous national job to be done.
A National Congress is a threshold, a
doorway to growth. If you did not
attend the meeting in Detroit, do not
fail to come to the 44th National
Recreation Congress in Philadelphia,
September 30-October 5, 1962.
Watch RECREATION Magazine for an-
nouncements.

 

PROMINENT AMONG special meetings
were the annual National Recrea-
tion Association and American Recrea-
tion Society Luncheons. At the former,
Howard Crowell, general superintend-
ent of the Detroit Parks and Recreation
Department, received a citation for out-
standing services to the field of recrea-
tion from James H. Evans of New York,
chairman of the Board of the Associa-
tion, in appreciation of Mr. Crowell’s
wholehearted cooperation with those
responsible for the annual gathering.

Mr. Prendergast reported on the

.-

progress of a series of discussions be-
ing conducted by the National Recrea-
tion Association for Life Magazine, un-
der a public-service grant ( see RECREA-
TION, September, Page 363). Its object
is to determine the National Purpose
of America; and results will be sum-
marized next Spring and presented to
governmental authorities including the
President of the United States. Such
discussions are considered by the As-
sociation as an excellent use of leisure
in the public interest.

Mr. Evans also took advantage of the
presence of R. Foster Blaisdell, presi-
dent of the American Recreation So-
ciety, at the next table as a special guest
of the Association, to extend through
him an invitation of the Association’s
Board of Directors for a oint meeting
with the officers of the American Rec-
reation Society at some mutually con-
venient time.

In addressing the American Recrea-
tion Society luncheon the next day, its
new president, William Frederickson,
followed this up by referring to frag-
mentation in the recreation field,saying,
“We have not yet developed Working
relationships based on mutual trust and
confidence among our organizations
and a sense of common cause. This it
will be my purpose to foster.” Among
the ARS citations and awards presented,
one went to Joseph Prendergast “in
recognition of exceptional service to
his fellowmen through the medium of
recreation.” Others receiving citations
were Reynold E. Carlson, Miriam
Evans-Burbridge, and Ruth McIntire;
fellow awards went to Dorothea Lensch,

Dorothy Taafie, and Beverly Sheffield.

THE ALL-CONGRESS Banquet and
Dance on Wednesday evening was
the really dress-up occasion of the week,
and had a very large attendance. Ches-
ter V. Pellegrin, president of the Detroit
Park and Recreation Commission pre-
sided, Father Clement H. Kern, pastor
of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church,
Detroit, gave the invocation. Introduc-
tions were made musically by Don
Large and the Honeybees, a singing
group from Detroit. The big event of
the evening was the address by Secre-
tary Udall on “The Role of the Federal
Government in the Field of Recreation”
(see RECREATION, November 1961).
Mr. Udall met and personally chatted
with the many recreation individuals
who crowded around him afterwards.
Another gala highlight of the evening
programs was the beautiful presenta-

DECEMBER; 1961

tion of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s
Carousel, which was especially staged
for the Congress in the luxurious Ford
Auditorium on Tuesday. It featured a
company of 150 singers, actors, dancers
———members of the Detroit Civic Center
Chorus and Civic Center Children’s
Chorus. Tickets to this event were dis-
tributed to registered delegates free of
charge. Not only was this terrific en-
tertainment but, done with taste and
color, it illustrated what a recreation de-

partment can do in providing a quality
program.

HELD THE Saturday and Sunday be-

fore the opening of the Congress,
the Sixth Annual Institute in Recreation
Administration, conducted by the Na-
tional Recreation Association, again
oversubscribed its quota of one bun-
dred executives. There is always a full
registration and waiting line for this
extremely popular series of training
sessions organized and directed by W.
C. Sutherland, head of NRA’s Recrea-
tion Personnel Service. Speaking on the
theme “Budget and Finance for Recrea-
tion Services,” leading Detroit experts
in municipal finance contributing to the
program were Walter Laidlaw, execu-
tive vice-president, United Foundation;
David B. Addy, Detroit auditor gen-
eral; and Edward N owak, budget direc-
tor. Among other institute speakers
were John H. Huss, executive director,
International City Managers Associa-
tion; Theodore R. Deppe, associate pro-
fessor of recreation, Indiana Univer-
sity, Bloomington; George Hjelte, gen-
eral manager, Department of Parks and
Recreation, Los Angeles; and Arthur
Williams, NRA associate director. Ed-
ward McGowan, lirst deputy superin-
tendent of the Detroit Department of
Parks and Recreation, was a member of
the planning committee for the Institute.

Mr. Prendergast Opened the Institute-
and spoke on “Recreation's Part in the
National Economy.” He pointed out
that, in the midst of our affluent society.
millions of Americans—more than one-
third of the nation—still require special
attention because of low income and
lack of education. Thirty-five percent
of all American families have incomes
under $4,000 a year before taxes. “No
city in the country today is spending
what it should to provide the creative

services and opportunities for this
thirty-five percent,” he said, and pre-
dicted that the $6.00 annual per capita
expenditure which the NRA has been
suggesting as a guide to city spending
for recreation must be revised. “Pre-
liminary figures for the 1962 Recrea-
tion and Par/cs Yearbook, compiled by
the Association,showa marked increase
in spending, by cities of all sizes," he
stated.

WIVES or DELEGATES had their own

headquarters in Coho Hall and a
coffee hour every morning at 9:30.
Here they assembled to get acquainted
and to discuss plans for the week. An
exciting program had been set up by a
local committee cochaired by Mrs. Te-
resa Wagner, director of special activi-
ties (retired) , and Barbara Tait, assist-
ant district supervisor, both of the De-
troit Parks and Recreation I)epartment.~
It included tours of Belle Isle, Detroit’s
new Civic Center, nearby Canada,
Northland Sh0pping Center, one of the
world’s largest, with lunch and a fash-
ion show at Stouffer’s.

THE AREA for commercial exhibits,

spaciously laid out and boasting
a beautiful park and a Cracker Barrel
Corner, was situated more or less in the
center of the Congress and offered a
convenient gathering place this year.
New faces were in evidence among the
exhibitors, bearing witness to the fact
that more and more manufacturers are
moving into the booming recreation:
equipment market. When strolling
through the area to greet old friends,
examine all that is new in equipment
or to keep an appointment, one was apt
to see some venturesome soul soaring
aloft on a trampoline or coasting down
the aisle on a new pair of roller skates.
Other activities of one kind or another
were going on all the time, with testing,
demonstrating of equipment for fenc-
ing, golf, and so on. Also, in a special
demonstration area, with bleachers pro-
vided for footsore spectators, the De-
troit Parks and Recreation Department
presented some of their program activi-
ties, among them a boys’ band concert,
a fencing exhibit, square dancing and
roller skating for retarded children. As
an additional drawing card, the area
boasted quite a number of places where
one could sit down! #

Without pride of achievement, the golden years lack luster . . .

Here are some suggestions for satisfying

program activities in the institution or club

Carol Lucas, Ed.D.

HE VOLUNTEER WAS DISCOURACED
——and frustrated. She had been

visiting the home for the aged
regularly to direct a program of recrea-
tion activities. She had worked hard;
but something obviously was wrong.
Fewer and fewer of the residents par-
ticipated in her activities. Strange! The
more she tried to wheedle them into
taking part in games or craft projects,
the more stubborn they became.

She was about to abandon the idea
of serving as a volunteer which, origin-
ally, she had found so intriguing. Then,
one day, a friend stopped by and in-
sisted that she come over and initiate a
new Ping-pong table. The volunteer
had never become adept at Ping-pong
and did not enjoy the game so she
begged off, but her friend kept insist-
ing. “Come on” she pleaded, “just one
game—you might find it’s fun if you’ll
just try it.”

Suddenly the volunteer knew exactly
what was wrong with her recreation
program at the home. No wonder the
residents rejected her entreaties! She
had not been concerned with their likes
or dislikes, their physical capabilities,
their whims—to be honest, she had

been trying to get them to do what she
wanted.

This volunteer, sadly enough, is not
unique. Many of us forget, or perhaps
have not yet learned, that recreation
cannot be superimposed on any indi-
vidual, old or young. It cannot be

planned for him. It must be planned
with him. Effective recreation pro-

grams for senior citizens, like other
recreation programs, do not just hap-
pen.

Every leader, however wise and won-
derful, needs a wealth of material on
which to draw. Program possibilities
for senior citizens fall, generally speak-
ing, into five categories: social activi-
ties; religious, educational, and service
projects; and activities in the arts.

Inclusion of everyone in some activ-
ity—those confined to wheelchairs and
even beds, as well as the healthy, vigor-
ous ones—is of primary importance in
planning recreation programs. In any
group there are likely to be some who
say they are not interested in, and do
not wish to participate in, recreation
activities, but often this simply indi-
cates they lack confidence to try. Pa-
tience, understanding, and imagination
on the part of the director or leader
frequently can build up the confidence
of the reluctant individual to the point
where he ends up running the show.

Card games, dancing, puzzles, dra-
matics—all are enjoyed by most older
people, and in most instances these ac-
tivities can be adapted to permit the
handicapped to enjoy them too. There
are talented people in every community
who are happy to entertain others if
they are sought out and their services
requested. There is one home where the
residents are entertained regularly by
a trained dog act and frequently by
local instrumentalists, a magician, and
several choral groups.

Many of us tend to develop our own
special rut in which we find it comfort-
able to operate. We repeat certain ac-
tivities week after week because it is
easier for us. But, in planning recrea-
tion, as in all other areas of life, variety
is a necessary spice. Perhaps a quick

rundown of some program possibilities
will prove helpful to those who have
little chance for shop-talk with others
similarly occupied.

Social activities can encompass an
endless list of things that people find
entertaining, but experience reveals
that senior citizens prefer simple things
done with sincerity and graciousness.
For example, most homes and clubs
make quite an event of a monthly birth-
day party when all the birthdays fall-
ing within that month are celebrated.
These parties are gala occasions, not
only for the birthday celebrants but for
all participants who contribute to the
affair by making favors, cards, and sim-
ple remembrances in craft sessions.

Religious activities provide great
comfort for older people. Whether
they are residents in a home or not,
senior citizens should be encouraged
to continue their church affiliations.
The religious counseling and personal
attention of a regular visiting chaplain
in a home often forms the basis of good
adjustment to group living. Weekly
hymn-sings, Bible study groups, prayer
meetings have great appeal for the eld-
erly and often are a source of inner
strength and peace of mind they can
find through no other channel.

Educational activities, for many
alert people, are stimulating and satis-
fying. The very fact that the elderly
are continuing the learning process
makes them feel they are still a part of
the mainstream of life, as they can and
should be. Stagnation is one of the
greatest threats as years increase and
activity decreases. In any home or
club there are likely to be some senior
citizens who need and thoroughly en-
joy educational films, lectures, and
group discussions led by various out-

RECREATION

 

side authorities. Trips to museums and
art galleries, tours through newspaper
plants or radio-TV stations, or other
interesting establishments in your com-

munity may prove extremely popular
and rewarding.

Service projects may be even more
effective in combating the sense of re-
jection and uselessness elderly people
are likely to develop. Your group,
whether in a home or a club, might
participate in local fund-raising drives
by helping to stuff and stamp envelopes
or doing other simple chores in their
own quarters. One year, as a Christ-
mas project, seventeen homes made 321
toys for children being cared for by
the Foster Home Division of the New
York City Welfare Department. Resi-
dents of the homes worked on this proj-
ect for at least six months, and the fact
that they were helping to make Christ-
mas a happy day for unfortunate
youngsters gave them a tremendous
feeling of being needed, of making an
important contribution to the life
around them.

Activities related to arts are extreme-
ly important for older people and must

be included in any comprehensive rec-
reation program. Through these ac-

tant for older people to release tensions. Left,

tivities, possibly more than through any
other channel, the individual has an
opportunity to eXpress himself, to re-
lease pent-up emotions — whatever
they may be. Bottled-up emotions,
whether they be in the nature of an-
xiety or self-pity, resentment, or what-
ever, are the source of many tensions
and much unhappiness.

Music, writing, simple arts and
crafts provide wonderfully effective
outlets. Music is used as a kind of
therapy in many hospitals, with great
success, for even the very sick can en-
joy a certain amount of participation—
a foot keeps time under a blanket, a
cane taps the floor. Recently, in a home
for the chronically ill and aged, a
seemingly listless old lady, bent dou-
hle with arthritis, sat in her wheelchair
during a music-therapy session, obli-
vious to the scene around her until a
certain hymn was played—suddenly
she straightened up and joined in the
singing.

For those who can or want to learn
to use their hands, there is an almost
unlimited choice of activities—for the
bedhound and handicapped, as well as
for the healthier older person. After
experimenting, they may find their in-
terest lies in painting. modeling, or

weaving; or in collecting items vary-
ing from cigar wrappers to fans or
whatever they fancy.

Some are intrigued by the prospect
of selling their handiwork for the bene-
fit of a pet charity, for pin money. or
for a special treat for the entire group.
Church bazaars offer excellent outlets
for articles made by senior citizens.
Hopefully, the time will come when
each church bazaar will highlight use-
ful and well-designed items that have
been produced by elderly people—"rec-
reation leaders in this field can help
to make it come soon.

There are few people, regardless of
age or handicap, who cannot do some-
thing well enough to be proud of it. It
is the business of the leader working
with the aging to find out what that
something is. For, without pride of
achievement, without the satisfaction of
creativity, the golden years become
tragically tarnished. Margaret Mead,
noted anthropologist, has declared: “It
is utterly false and cruelly arbitrary to
put all the learning into childhood. all
the work into middle age. and all the
regrets into old age.” May we add . . .
it is also unneec5sary? You who are
concerned with recreation for senior

citizens can make it untrue. #

The Theater

as Teacher

This address to the recent American Educational Theater
Conference in New York City speaks forcefully to
recreation leaders as well—in relation to the performing

arts in recreation

Abraham Ribicoff

IT IS LEGEND . . .
' that the god of
all the arts once
whispered into the
ear of young Ed-
win Booth and . . .
said: “I shall give
you hunger, and

 

pain, and sleepless nights. Also beauty
and satisfactions known to few and
glimpses of the heavenly life. None of
these you shall have continually and of
their coming and going you shall not
be foretold.”

You whose work is in the theater—
and the introduction of young pe0ple
to the theater—you have known the
sleepless nights, as well as the satisfac-
tions and “glimpses of the heavenly
life” your art offers.

You will appreciate the answer one
of my favorite critics gave me the other
day when I asked him why he prefers
the theater to the rest of his amusement-
page beat. “That’s simple,” he said.
“In television, the people are dimin-
ished. They are thumbsized. In the
movies, the people are enlarged.
They’re bigger than I am. But in the
theater, the people are just my size.
IV hen I watch them, I can even forget
where I am.”

How right he is. Other art forms
can be wonderful indeed. But the thea-
ter mirrors life in scale. In the theater,
you can lean forward for fear you will
miss something—you are drawn ahead

—you are carried out of your seat by
the live people on the stage. . . .

The best plays are more than diver-
sions. They are great teachers. They
convince us that what is happening on
the stage—however far removed in time
or in geography—is not very different
from what is happening in our hearts
and in our everyday lives. And so we
learn from them.

You [leaders in the theater] know
the effect such plays have on an audi-
ence. You know too the hunger that
audiences have for the theater—the
theater that delights the eye and ear and
enriches the mind and heart. If anyone
doubted this hunger for a minute—and
we in public life frequently hear the
excuse that the public isn’t ready for or
doesn’t appreciate this or that fine art
—such doubts should have been erased
by the long queues that formed this
summer to see M uch Ado About N oth-
ing in Central Park [New York City].

Yours is a tremendous opportunity.
More of our youngsters are enjoying
college and university education than
ever before. In the next year their num-
bers will, we all hope, increase even
further. Community theater and chil-
dren’s theater groups mushroom across

the land. . . .

YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE is to teach so

creatively, so imaginatively, that
you will convey the best of our drama-
tic heritage, experience, and taste to a
new generation, and to adults as well
—that you will strengthen the ties that
bind our civilization to the great civil-
izations of the past. . . .

Asked what the theater had given
him, the actor, Howard Lindsay, an-
swered: “It has been my education.
Where else could I have traveled so far?
I have been in the streets of Corinth
when Jason and Medea were throwing
harsh words at each other. I was at
Aulis when the Greek fleet sailed to
Troy. I was in Mycenae when Orestes
came back to kill his mother Clytem-
nestra. I have been in the drawing
rooms of Lady and Lord Windermere
of London. And I shouldn’t forget to
say, I have ridden into Western towns
with the James brothers. Where else
could I have done things like that?” . . .

Can you leaders of the theater take
your students to these—and further
places? Can you give them the sense
of continuity, the depth and breadth of
vision that a deep knowledge of your
art conveys?

Can you give them something more?
Many of our young people have lost the
satisfaction of the craftsmen of old—
the satisfaction of doing a job care-
fully and lovingly—the fulfillment of
work well done. They go to school—
they graduate—they get jobs to support
themselves and their families.

You can help them find this satisfac-
tion. For the theater is a place where
people share responsibility — where
they have such fun that they even for-
get they are learning and working. If
you give this experience to youngsters
and to amateur community players, you
will truly have taught well, you will
have strengthened the ties that bind
human beings, one with another.

YOU have a further responsibility—
a further challenge. It lies waiting
to be seized. There are"only, I am told,
about seventy thousand commercial
theater seats available to the public in
the United States. Some thirty thou-
sand of these are in New York City,
and their number is diminishing. There
are many reasons for this—you are all
aware of the problem.

. . . Americans want to go to the thea-
ter. They flock to see great plays. When
stripped of its social pretensions —
what Professor Eric Bentley calls its
“amazingly upper class mores and ex-
traordinarily inconvenient prices and
schedules” — the theater is a tremen-
dously popular attraction. Professor

Bentley speaks of the “social appara-
tus” that used to stand between the pub-
lic and the enjoyment of good music.
“Opera and symphony,” he says, “were
addressed to dowagers. The working-
man didn’t have the right clothes for
the occasion, or the right accent, or the
right kind of chitchat. Invited to a con-
cert he could hardly be expected not to
feel a pariah. Much the same is true
of theater.”

He goes on to point out that in the
cultural revolution that is underway all
over the world, the theater could play
a leading part because it is “more ac-
cessible to the new untrained audiences
than perhaps any other high art what-
soever.” * * * And this fact “gives it a
certain responsibility.” * * *

The word educate comes from the
Latin verb “lead out.” This is what you
can do—lead people out of themselves
and into the common meeting place—
where they can share their art with
others. Your theater groups do not ful-
fill their purpose if they confine them-
selves to a series of exercises—if they
do not reach all the audiences that are
anxious to be reached. . . .

JUST AS IT PLAYS A ROLE in bridging
the gap between different segments
and groups and countries in our soci-
ety, the theater can play an important
role in bridging the gap between what
C. P. Snow has called “the two cul-
tures.” We are all concerned about the
wall that divides the humanities from
the ever-expanding physical sciences.
We are all anxious to do what we can

of the beauties of the arts. Far from it.
We know there is great beauty as well
as hope in the giant revolution which
has taken place in man’s knowledge of
himself and of the world.

But we know that if we are to
act constructively, we must tap our
magnificent artistic resources imagina-
tively and diligently. A broad and deep
awareness of the arts enriches the sci-
entist as well as the nonscientist and is
indispensable to the full life of all man-

kind.

WE LIVE TODAY in one of the crucial
eras of world history. The im-
pact of man’s new power upon nian him-
self is the stuff of real drama—and
through drama as well as other arts
could man better understand his place
in the new world he is creating. There
has never been a time when interest in
the arts at the seat of government has
been so high. The Kennedy administra-
tion would like to see the establishment
of a National Advisory Council on the
Arts—a group of eminent citizens from
the arts whose duty it would be to cul-
tivate and encourage our artistic re-
sources and heritage.

The council would recommend ways
to maintain and increase the cultural
resources of the United States; propose
methods to encourage private initiative
in the arts; cooperate with local, state,
and federal departments and agencies
to foster artistic and cultural endeavors
and the use of the arts in the best inter-
ests of the nation; and strive to stimu-
late greater appreciation of the arts by
our citizens. Further, it could act as a
coordinating .group between private
and governmental activities in the arts,

pointing out where it believes official
encouragement might be helpful, yet al-
ways sensitive to the need for the fullest
possible freedom of creativity.

For in fostering and encouraging the
arts, we must have it strictly understood
that the government cannot and does
not wish to speak through the arts. The
arts must be free and not an official
mouthpiece. A play is not a state paper.
The only test for an act0r or a director
or a painter or a musician should be
the excellence of his endeavor before

‘the judgment of his peers.

IN THIS caucus. MOMENT when the

currents of history are swift and
changing, we who hear the responsibil-
ity of government seek to build. We
know that the old ways alone will not
do—that we must seek new ways and
find new means. And all segments of
American society are responding. Each
is examining its role and its potential.
Each is dedicating itself to constructive
action for the common good.

I ask you [whose work is in the arts]
only to do your best, to achieve the high
levels that you yourselves value. and to
inspire in your students an appreciation
of the enduring and the beautiful. I ask
you to strive to reflect the times in
which we livc-—to understand them——
to teach from them—to improve upon
them. W e must work to make our arts
so rich—so exciting—so inventive—
that they mirror our life together as did
the arts of the Greeks and of the Eliza-
bethan Age.

Then we will have met our challenge.
Then we will have done our part to
strengthen the human bond. #-

A key address from the 43rd National Recreation Congress

CREATION,

RECREATION,
and SCIENCE

Willard D. Cheek

Y EXPERIENCE with recreation di-
M rectors has been that they, and
their work, are as organized
and systematized as any branch of
physics or mathematics that I have ever
taught. In fact, most science educators
could learn a great deal from the gen-
eral truths and laws exemplified by rec-
reation activities. For instance, if a
twelve-year-old boy is capable of run-
ning the one hundred yard dash in ten
seconds, no recreation director would
have the audacity to say: “Now, look
here young man, you can’t do that. You
haven’t had our prerequisite courses
one and two on the one hundred dash,
or even our basic fast-walking course.”
However, if a twelve-year-old boy can
understand calculus in the sixth grade
there isn’t one school in a hundred who
will let him run the course. Yet we say
in this country that every child has the
opportunity to do the very best he can
with his mind and his body—no holds
barred. Recreation directors need to
give a few speeches to our scientists
and educators. They can learn a great
deal from the recreation field.

The prestige of science has risen to
such a level that it is now hoped by
some groups—even a few recreation di-
rectors—that the scientist has a “magic
salve” that will heal their wounds or at
least improve their complexion. Unfor-
tunately, such a salve does not exist.
Webster defines science as “. . . accumu-
lated knowledge systematized and for-
mulated with reference to the discovery
of general truths or the operation of
general laws.” Science is not confined

to just mathematics, chemistry, and
physics. Recreation directors are sci-
entists, too, if they are carrying on their
work in an organized, systematized, and
self-disciplined manner. If you are rest-
less, concerned people searching for un-
derstanding, people dissatisfied with the
recreation programs in your communi-
ties, but people who are able and willing
to do something about it, then you are
as important to the welfare of this coun-
try as any group of scientists.

L ET’s ASK OURSELVES'R question or
two. What is it that separates the

organized, systematized people from.

those who are not? What brings suc-
cess to one man and mediocrity or fail-
ure to his brother? How shall we make
our strength count most in this world
of effort? I believe the one thing that
makes a person more useful to the
world, that makes the most of any man,
is creativity; the ability, the willingness
to get ideas and the courage to do some-
thing with them.

How can we be creative? To be crea-
tive we must first be sensitive to the
problems about us. We must keep in
mind that everything and anything can
be improved. Nothing is ever as well
done as it could be. This applies to
recreation as well as to mathematics;
it applies to getting along with other
people, as well as getting other people
to cooperate with us. In every situation
we meet, no matter how many times we
have handled it before, an opportunity
exists to flnd a way to do it better.

To BE CREATIVE we must obtain many

ideas. Idea Huency is one of the
keys to creativity. There are oftentimes
many right answers to the same prob-
lem; just as there are many right an-

swers to the design of automobiles.
However, to find the best idea requires
the sifting of many ideas; the more
ideas, the better the chance of finding
the best one. Get as many different ap-
proaches as possible, don’t worry about
whether they are good or not in the be-
ginning; each succeeding idea may
bring you nearer to the best solution.

We need to remind ourselves that
some of our best ideas come to us quite
unexpectedly. The controlled fusion
reaction was first conceived during a
casual luncheon conversation and the
rudiments of its operation recorded on
a tablecloth. So be prepared at all times
to record your ideas; keep a file of your
notes along with newspaper and maga-
zine clippings on articles and books and
refer to them often. Whatever system
you devise for recording your ideas, re-
member that the objective is to enable
you to quickly gather everything you
have seen, read, heard, or experienced
on a problem when you need it.

CREATIVITY is the secret weapon, the

“magic salve” of the scientists. The
good ones are not only thinkers, but
doers. They have problem sensitivity;
they gather lots of ideas and place them
in a retrievable form; they constantly,
incessantly challenge the obvious; they
preach and practice that everything and
anything can be improved.

Let us also consider attitudes—atti-
tudes toward problems. If we are not
born with problems—physical, mental
or economical—we very quickly create
them. We work vigorously and indus-
triously to obtain an education and win
the confidence of others so we can take
on problems. However, when we finally
arrive and are given problems to solve,
we too often hide our faces and are fear-
ful; we tend to rationalize and pretend
that these problems and our work are
unimportant. The future of this great
nation, and all of the free world, rests
in the hands of trained men and women
like ourselves. We dare not hide our
faces and be fearful, we must endeavor
to solve each problem as it is presented
to us. We must feel our work is the
most important work to be done, and
worthy of our utmost devotion. #

HIGHWAYS bring people to parks; un-

fortunately, all too often they take
land away from parks. To park and
recreation specialists, in fact, the mod-
ern highway is the great monster which
devours their children. All too often
parks and playgrounds lie astride the
' most logical routes, if only physical con-
ditions are considered. And, all too often, highway planners
regard an unbuilt-upon park or playground as though it
were, in fact, unused, and hence logically available for high-
way use.

The fact is that parks and playgrounds produce large
direct values. The fact that most of them are available free
or for charges much less than their full value masks their
full economic significance. Such measurements as have been
made suggest that the larger suburban and closer state parks
may well produce direct net incomes attributable to the land
and other resources of $1,000 or more per acre annually.
In-city parks and playgrounds, usually used more inten-
sively, probably produce much greater values. But these
direct values are only a small part of the economic worth
of parks and playgrounds.

One indispensable hallmark of a desirable residential area
or urban community is its parks and playgrounds; without
them, the value of all property declines or fails to reach its
potential. It is hard to measure the amount of this effect,
especially as it applies to a single dwelling or neighborhood;
but it seems clear there is a high correlation between ade-
quacy of parks and playgrounds on the one hand and the
values of property in the community on the other. It is note-
worthy that most slum clearance projects establish, or re-
establish, at least some park and playground area, even on
the very high-priced land with which they are concerned.

 

' ' 'ICHWAY PLANNERS would do well to c0nsider in the fu-
H ture the values of park and playground areas more
seriously than they seem to have done in the past. Highway
planners and engineers cannot afford to seem in neglect or
indifference of recreation values; to do so would alienate

PARKS

large segments of the professional and general publics. A
little advance consultation and a little more willingness to
listen to the viewPoints of park and recreation specialists
and enthusiasts would go far toward reducing the almost
universal resentment among such groups toward highway
specialists.

Today’s highways are better suited to moving cattle to
market than to moving people for recreation. The modern
highway, especially the modern superhighway, is an elegant
means of moving goods and people physically; the curves
are smooth, the road surface is supersmooth, stoppages are
at a minimum, and maximum distances can be traversed in
minimum time. But they are also completely devoid of in-
tellectual stimulation or emotional content. The astronauts
who must some day travel for days on end through space
with nothing to do and with only the most limited physical
movements would do well to train by long superhighway
trips, where the conditions are remarkably similar. The
View is monotonously bland; the driver can do nothing but
drive, and the passengers can do little more. The radio of-
fers weak escape. But the travel is often a major part,
time-wise, of the whole recreation experience. When my
family and I had a five—week vacation camping in the West
last summer, we spent almost two weeks of it on the road,
to and from—two weeks of largely nothingness. The boys
could read books and work crossword puzzles about half as
well as they could have in their own rooms at home.

ANY STRETCH of America has unique natural resources,
unique history, significant present culture and econ-
omy. Why cannot some of this be brought to travellers?
Some, of course, enjoy the nothingness of highway travel,
but others would genuinely appreciate an opportunity for
intellectual refreshment, if not solid meat.

The average urban dweller of today knows remarkably
little about the rural landscape he sees. He may not know
one farm crop from another; he will almost surely fail to
distinguish a highly improved farm pasture from nonde-
script weeds and grass. He may not know one kind or breed
of farm livestock from another. Land forms and features,
such as moraines, escarpments, rivers, lakes, and the like,
may have little meaning {or him. He may be able to dis-
tinguish a steel mill from an oil refinery, but he is most un-

likely to know why gas may be flared from either. Unless

AND

LOCAL
DEVELOPMENTS

CALIFORNIA. Complete facilities for training under-

water divers are included in the $850,000 aquatorium in
the city of Commerce. The pool will open with a big splash
—a four-day aquatic spectacular—December 6-10. More
than twelve feet deep at its east end, the pool has an under-
water observation room where instructors can study the
progress of swimmers and high divers as well as underwater
divers. However, the instructor doesn’t need to use sign
language to communicate with his student: an underwater
sound system with four special speakers in the pool allows
direct contact with the student at all times. A smaller pool,
36’-by-60’, has a maximum depth of five feet, but a special
control allows the level to be quickly lowered for use by
smaller children.

Instead of featuring a large and often little-used gym-
nasium as the key building of this recreation complex,
Mayor Maurice Quigley, former recreation director Jay
Guler, and the Commerce City Council concentrated on the
development of a pair of swimming pools. While the gym-
nasium is still there, reduced to a more appropriate and
functional size for physical conditioning activities, the aqua-
torium is the point of interest. In addition to dressing
rooms, there are meeting rooms, a large kitchen capable of
feeding 120 at a sit-down dinner, a refreshment building,
and the adjacent gymnasium. Also adjoining the aquato-

rium are children’s supervised play areas that include a '

small wading pool for toddlers.

Glass, steel, aluminum, and brick combine to give the
aquatorium an indoor-outdoor effect. Floor-to-ceiling glass
doors and walls provide daytime lighting on three sides, to-

 

520

gether with forty-eight skylights in the ceiling. Four roof
hatches, operated electrically, 18’ -by-40’, further add to the
indoor-outdoor charm. Doors of the north and west wall
also lift up to open the entire side of the patio.

To prevent the serious corrosion which often occurs from
effects of chlorine-laden moisture on metals and paints of
indoor swimming pools, the architects, Hunter and Bene-
dict, have designed a continuous stainless steel duct, 477
feet in length, located at the ceiling near the exterior walls
from which tempered air will be directed downward over the
glass walls. Exhaust will be through perimeter fioor ducts
to the outside. The big pool will use 220,000 gallons of
water, while the training pool has 70,000 gallons.

FLORIDA. The State Road Department has constructed

twenty-four boat ramps during the last eighteen months,
increasing the statewide total of these public facilities to
ninety-seven. The department initiated its boat ramp pro-
gram in 1945 but it never approached the construction pace
set during the last year and a half when one-fourth of the
existing total were built. This accelerated construction pace
was prompted by the adOption of a “Wayside Park and
Boat Ramp” policy by the road board in November of 1959.

The growing trend in Florida toward the use of small
portable boats increased the demand for sites to launch this
fleet of privately owned craft and the rising popularity of
water skiing and skin-diving augmented the need for these
public facilities. The road board policy provides for con-
struction of adequate launching facilities and spells out re-
strictions governing such construction. The restrictions are
governed by existing right-of-way policies, funds available
for such projects, and the desire to avoid competition with
commercial facilities already available.

In addition to the ever-increasing number of boat launch-
ing sites, the road department has continued to expand its
network of over two hundred wayside parks. These road-
side rest and picnic areas have become increasingly popular
with the millions of tourists who visit the state each year.
Many of them are built in conjunction with the boat ramps
to provide access to Florida’s thousands of rivers, lakes, and
inland waterways.

o The state is now developing Falling Waters State Park,
south of Chipley. The park’s major attraction will be an
impressive waterfall.

KENTUCKY. Park acquisition is progressing rapidly in
Jefferson County which recently acquired eighty acres of
parkland adjoining a ninety-acre lake. The park will in-
clude a twenty-acre wooded tract on one side of McNeely
Lake and sixty acres on the other side. By the end of 1961
Jefferson County will have acquired more than three thou-
sand acres of parkland. This will complete a chain of parks
extending from one end of the county to the other. The
county has started development of four-hundred acre Long
Run Park and has also bought the home of George Rogers
Clark, the founder of Louisville, to preserve as a shrine.

The state will share in the $250,000 cost of the 156-year-old

home and the fifty-five acres surrounding it.

RECREATION

MARYLAND. Another large facility that can be used for
roller skating as well as gym activities is part of the new
$150,000 youth center building in Greenbelt. The large
room, 85’-by-58’, accommodates basketball, volleyball, bad-
minton, large dances, and other activities. The lounge is
28’-by-15’ and is used for table tennis, record hops, and
dropin activities for the teenagers after school. These two
rooms are also connected to the gym by a large sliding door
which is opened to use on festive occasions with a large
attendance. The building also houses the offices of the rec-
reation department and two arts-and-crafts rooms, 14’-by-
20’ each. A sound system can accommodate taped roller-
skating music in the gym, while at the same time platters
for a record hop are spinning in the general-purpose room.
The center also includes a director’s ofiice with a snack bar
that opens onto the lounge area. All of the building, with
the exception of the gym, is air conditioned. It overlooks
the athletic fields on one side (a baseball field, football field,
and a lighted softball diamond) with the community swim-
ming pool on the other side. Funds for construction were
raised by a voter referendum in 1959. The operation of the
center is incorporated in the general tax fund under the
recreation department.

NEW HAMPSHIRE. The state is busily developing a 300-

acre site at Otter Lake in Greenfield. Work is expected to
be completed for the park to open on July 1, 1962. Green-
field State Park is expected to become one of the largest
multiple-use units in the state park system. About $98,000
has been eXpended for acquisition of land and $10,000 for
forest improvement from funds made available by a special
appropriation of the 1957 legislature for a Monadnock Re-
gion state park.

0 The state has also approved a Department of Resources
and Economic Development, which will include a Division
of Parks. This move abolished the state’s Planning and
Development, Forestry, and Recreation Commissions.

NEW JERSEY. The U.S. Defense Department has leased
to the state a 460-acre site on Sandy Hook Peninsula (see
iECREATION, October 1961, Page 398) for public recreation
use. The Defense Department has also indicated that it will
turn over the entire 1,600-acre peninsula to the state as soon
as national defense permits. The northern end of the hook
is now occupied by Fort Hancock, an important radar and
missile installation.

0 A $53,000 bond issue is being spent 011 recreation im-
provements in Paterson. In addition, the city has just been
given an area in an urban-renewal development totaling
ninety-thousand square feet. A bond issue of approximately
$150,000 will be issued to develop this tract.

NEW MEXICO. An animated beaver, complete with an
electronically activated sound track and a log to chew on
when he isn’t talking, welcomes visitors to the “smallest
national forest.” Dedicated in October, the pint-sized (11/;-
acre) Beaver National Forest, planned as an educational
exhibit. is located at Ghost Ranch Museum on the old Piedra

northwest of.Santa Fe. In addition to the “talking beaver,”
the forest offers seventeen life-like replicas of people, domes-
tic animals, and wildlife enjoying and using its resources.
From a central location the beaver directs the visitors’ at-
tention to the forest and explains how the forests are truly
“lands of many uses.” As official multiple-use tour guide,
the beaver points out the grazing sheep in an aspen meadow
and cattle on the range, a wild turkey hen in the protective
shadow of a pine, and the doe and her fawn who are brows-
ing close by a fourteen-foot fire tower manned by a forest
guard.

The forest sounds and appropriate music increase the rap-
port between the visitor and the miniature forest. The fig-
ures of campers, picnickers, and a fisherman come alive
for those who have ever walked along a wilderness trail or
enjoyed the many other forms of recreation found in Na-
tional Forest playgrounds. After museum visitors have lis-
tened to “Mr. Beaver,” they can enjoy the real thing on the
nearby Carson and Santa Fe National Forests.

NEW YORK. The American Zionist Youth Connnission

plans to double the size of its coeducational national camp
at Highland, near Port Jervis, by the construction of a new
junior division camp for 250 eight-to-fourteen-year-old boys
and girls and fifty counsellors. The new camp will be the
junior division of lOO-acre Camp Tel Yehudah, accommoo

countries. An exchange program brings a group of Boy and
Girl Scouts from Israel each summer. The Israeli Boy Scouts
participate in events at the nearby Ten Mile River Camp
of the Boy Scouts of America.

The largest building will be the two-story recreation-
dining ball. This will be an elongated 64’-by-92’ hexagon,
deliberately designed to inspire thoughts of the Bible ark.
Laminated beam and column construction will make possi-
ble completely open areas on both hoors, with open sides
screened. French door-type panel's may be closed to keep
out rain and winds. The second floor also will have clere-
story windows of Barclite, a translucent plastic. A wide
porch will run around hve sides of the building and empha-
size the ark concept. Storage and utility rooms will be in
the basement. The ground floor will be the dining hall for
three hundred persons and the second floor will be a recrea-
tion room large enough for three junior-size basketball
courts, as well as a 16’-by-40’ stage at one end. The new
camp will be ready for use next summer.

0 The annual report of the Schenectady Department of
Parks and Recreation reveals an impressive list of major
improvements completed during the past year and an equal-
ly impressive list of improvements scheduled for 1961. De-
velopment during the past year included a new boathouse
and concrete dock at Central Park; twelve new tennis courts
on the site of a former baseball held; twenty-six hoodlights,
consisting of 3900 watts, installed in the city museum build-
ing in an attempt to curb vandalism in the playground area;
a new Western area adjacent to the miniature train area at
Central Park, consisting of log cabins and a fort gate.
The department brought in two boxcar loads of sea sand
from New Jersey for the swimming and wading beaches at
Central and Steimetz Parks. Some forty tons were placed
on each beach. The recreation area adjacent to the Junior
Chamber of Commerce baseball held had its high crown
removed through bulldozing and grading. Some eight hun-
dred cubic yards of black loam and seed was put in, so that
grass was grown by November, and this held is now being
used for archery. Nearly hfty new rose gardens were added
to Central Park during the summer. New roses added in-
cluded some 359 specimens of all colors, some twenty-one
rose trees, and 111 old-fashioned roses for which a new sec-
tion of Central Park was opened. During 1961 new fiber-
glass playground equipment will be installed on the play-
grounds and the outlet at Steimetz Park lake will be com-
pletely hlled in for a parking area. Also to be hlled in is

the Central Park lagoon outlet. Ballhelds will be built on
the Lennox Road old quarry area.

0 A $500,000 park in Nassau County, on a 100-acre site in
Wantagh, is under construction and scheduled for comple-
tion in 1962. A large picnic area, walks, playgrounds, ball-
fields, a marina, parking facilities, and the eventual im-
provement of the waterfront for bathing are planned for
the park.

0 Among the urban renewal projects in the works in Buf-
falo is a massive lakefront development. Plans call for con-
struction of a mile-and-a-half drive; a thirty-acre, man-made
island with an amphitheater and a restaurant; public and
private boating facilities for more than a thousand craft.

B. FOSTER BLAISDELL
1912-1951

FOSTER BLAISDELL, immediate

0 past-President of the American
Recreation Society, died of a heart at-
tack on October 29th at his home in To-
peka, Kansas. This news will come as a
great shock to his many friends every-
where, as it has to those in the Ameri-
can Recreation Society and the National
Recreation Association, with whom he has worked so closely.

Foster Blaisdell, at 49, was in the prime of life. His hne
concept of public service and his devotion to the recreation
held motivated his professional life during the thirty-one

 

years in which he served the recreation movement. His hair
for leadership was reflected by his effective presidency of
the American Recreation Society this past year and by the
fact that in earlier years he had served as president of the

Society, as chairman of the Southern District Advisory Com-
mittee of the National Recreation Association, and as presi-
dent or chairman of other importantbodies in the held of
recreation. Always deeply interested in aquatics, he gave
generously of himself in that held through ofhcial responsi-
bilities under the Amateur Athletic Union of the United
States of which he was an honorary life member.

Mr. Blaisdell’s ability as a skillful and competent admin-
istrator advanced the cause of recreation in each of the cities
in which he served, including Waco and Tyler, Texas; Char-
lotte, North Carolina; and Topeka, Kansas. Thirteen years
ago he served for a period of months as Southern District
representative for the National Recreation Association but,
preferring administrative work and less travel, returned to
the held of his choice at Charlotte. This gave him more time
with Mrs. Blaisdell and their three children and more time
for one of his favorite hobbies—home gardening.

Having been a long time supporter of the National Rec-
reation Association and the American Recreation Society,
Foster did much in his recent official capacities to enhance
the level of common understanding and accord between

these bodies. The whole recreation movement should be

grateful for the life and service of this dedicated man.

TIC-TAC-TOE with an Adult Twist

Glenn C. Dahlem

NE OF THE FINEST pencil-and-paper recreation activities
0 is the old standby tic-tac-toe. This game has one draw-
back, however, and that is that games betweens experienced,
seasoned players are apt to result in ties. This fact has lim-
ited the game’s usefulness, and, because of this, it is played
more by younger children than by older persons.

It is possible, however, to change tic-tac-toe into a more
involved game without destroying its essential character-
istics. This tends to introduce strategical considerations,
makes games longer and forces players to do some serious
thinking before making their moves.

In order to adapt tic-tac-toe to adult play, an extra verti-
cal and an extra horizontal bar are added to the traditional
playing area, increasing the number of possible playing
squares from nine to sixteen. A scoreboard for X’s and 0’s
is drawn next to the playing area, since points are scored
in the modified version.

X begins the game,
but, unlike regular tic-
tac-toe, he takes two
moves in one turn. 0
follows, and he, too, is
allowed two moves. X
then takes his next two
moves, 0 his, and so on,
until each has had four
turns, and the sixteen
square playing area is
filled. Points are scored,

one for each row of three, two for each row of four Ia row
of four is nothing more than two rows of three, sharing two
marks in common). Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal rows
are possible for scoring, as in regular tic-tac-toe. The player
with the most points when the playing area is filled is the
winner.

Strategical considerations in the modified game are both
offensive and defensive, as each player must plan his scor-

ing strategy carefully, but must also try to stop his opponent
from scoring. The illustrations show a move-by-lnove break.

To help him gain the feeling of move-
ment on skis, parents can watch him
walk across the snow on flat ground,
and take him between their legs down
short, shallow hills on little skis—uthis
as soon as he is able to walk steadily.
Because poles can turn into weapons,
they should not be given to him until
he is sure of his movements on skis,
and under close supervision.

Never take a child dressed in rubber
boots and leather bindings to an in-
structor. This kind of equipment defies
instruction, and invites twisted ankles.

Because skis and boots must fit well
for best results, equipment should be
considered carefully. It is wise to buy
or rent the child’s gear at a reputable
ski shop, and to take someone who
knows equipment along with you. If
boots can be bought to fit well over two
pairs of fairly heavy socks, they can be
used for the next year or two over thin-
ner socks or one pair. Boots are not
fitted like a shoe; they are laced with
the heel on the ground, the toe in the
air, pushing the heel of the foot back
into the heel of the boot. Therefore.

DECEMBER, 1961

 

ideally, the sizing is about one smaller
than for an ordinary shoe. It is impor-
tant that they give strong support from
the base of the heel to above the ankle
bones, and that they are narrow enough
to allow the child to feel the edge of
his ski. In other words, when he bends
his ankle sideways, the ski should be
edged accordingly.

The skis need not be expensive. but
should be well designed, coated with
plastic or varnish, with a plastic base
and steel edges. N0 consideration
should ever be given to buying a ski
without steel edges, regardless of age
of child or snow conditions. For a per-
fect length, the ski tip should come to
the base of the thumb as the child
stands, reaching upward as far as he
can. Poles should be light, reaching
from floor to armpit. In choosing equip-
ment, the largest problem is the con-
tinual, fast growth of the child. In
many areas, or among groups of fam-
ilies, there are equipment pools for local
distribution .of outgrown but still use-
able boots, skis and poles of variable
sizing. However, if one of these pools

Or a good rental shop is not available,
size of equipment can be flexible, within
limits. Provided the boots give the sup-
port described above through wearing
no more than three pair of medium-
weight socks, or two pair of heavy
socks, they can be the same size as the
ordinary shoe, or a size larger, and still
be effective. Skis can reach to the up-
wardly extended fingertips of the child,
and will still be maneueverable. Poles
may be shoulder height to allow for
growth, if necessary.

It is definitely wise to fit the child
to a safety binding, which is checked
for adjustment every time’ he puts on
his skis. It is also very important that
he have a “safety strap,” a leather strap
or cord attaching the ski binding to the
ski boot. This is to prevent the ski from
flying off down the hill if the safety
binding should release the boot from

the ski.

Before Formal Lessons:

A child has a wonderful advantage,
when he is mature enough to be put into
a class and has been prepared well be-
fore hand. A way to spark his interest
may be to appeal subtly to his love of
sliding down hills, down bannisters,
over polished floors and patches of ice.

Show him how you slide on skis.
Let him trying sitting on one, and then
go careening down a terrace. (It is
wise not to keep a sled or toboggan
around the house, as it tends to be a
counterattraction.) Then put him on
his own skis, and he’ll try to stand up
and slide. He’ll probably love falling
into the snowdrifts, so this won’t deter
him from trying again.

Take him where he can see other
children his own size and age going
down the hills, and let him see how
much fun they are having. Should a
child become discouraged from too
many falls, try holding him in front of
you with his skis between yours, while
you slide down a gentle slope. Then,
when you’re almost stopped, but still
have a little momentum, let him go on
alone, without disturbing his position
as you let go. Almost inevitably, he’ll
fall, but for a moment or two, he will
feel himself standing up and sliding
alone. There should be as little physical
contact as possible between teacher and
pupil, however, as the child must gain

526

confidence on his own. It cannot be
given to him.

On a wonderful sunny day, pack a
picnic lunch, and take him on a cross-
country skiing adventure through the
woods. Point out the animal tracks, the
winter birds, and all the unusual sights
along the way.

Then next time you go skiing, take
him to your usual ski area, and put him
into the hands of the ski school, or the
person in your group who is to handle
children’s classes. It is best, then, to
fade into the background, to be within
call, but as much out of sight as possi-
ble, during the first lessons, and there-
after, completely away. Presence of the
parent during the lesson is liable to
make the child self-consciouskoverly-
competitive or inattentive. After a few
hours, under supervision, a mature five-
year-old can be as independent as a ma-

ture fifty-year-old.

Lessons:

For the most part, group lessons are
best—a group of five or ten. A child’s
attention span will beshorter than an
adult’s, he will tire more quickly, and
he’ll thrive under the competition and
fun of being with others his own age,
trying the same things. A private les-
son would be helpful to start him, and
then a few more private lessons of about
half an hour in duration, from time to
time. But on the whole, he will gain
most from skiing with a group of his
own ability level, behind the instructor.

Class Control:

Children must understand, in the first
five minutes of their lesson, the class
system. The only way for the instructor
and the class to be happy is to be well
organized, each fully understanding his
part. Simply enough, the best indoc-
trination is an even lineup in front of
the instructor. The children get the feel
of their place in the plan this way. This
is your basic class control. Pretty soon
they’ll be asking, “What’s the order
now,” and chastising each other if any-
one’s out of place.

_ In the beginning, the child should
simply be walked around on skis beside
his instructor, on flat ground. He will
learn to turn around both ways, and to
lift his skis and step sideways. He will
then step sideways up and down a small

incline—then up a gentle slope, for his
first free run downhill. This should be
a distance of about five to ten yards,
with a flat outrun. He’ll find this simply
wonderful, want to do it again and
again until he’s told that “anyone can
go straight, what about trying to stop?
See if you can plow the snow out of
your way.”

The well-coordinated child will learn
so quickly, at the beginning, that noth-
ing will seem too much for him. He will
ask to go over the bumps, down the
steeper hills, wanting to go straight,
over everything in sight. And here is
the point where he can be developed
into a skier, or left to go his own way
with the other “schussboomers.” If left
to himself, he is very apt to fall into
poor technique that will get him down
safely, but will be useless later on for
really expert skiing.

On the Lift:

“This afternoon we go up the lift!”
This is a big event in a child’s skiing.
Ever since he started lessons, he’s been
looking at the big mountain above,
watching the other skiers swooshing
over the sparkling snow. This is his
Everest.

On all lifts, his poles should be off

his wrists, and held clear of the ground,
by himself or someone else. In the case
of a T-bar, he can simply be placed in
front of the instructor, skis inside the
instructor’s. He leans back and rides
off, very comfortable for both.

After he gets used to this, he can be
started on the side. The instructor low-
ers the bar of the T until it is straight
across, under the seat of the child—and
usually under the instructor’s knees.
This is very uncomfortable for the
adult, and as our point is to make the
child independent and able to ride up
with people his own size (no matter
how small)—the easiest way is to place
him with experienced people graduat-
ing from tall to short, until he is at
home on the T-bar with any shape or
size.

He should be told not to hesitate to
ask a grownup to lower the bar if it is
in the wrong place, never to let it go
suddenly, to get off on the same side he
is on, and to get off one at a time. In
cases of most T-bars, children learn to

Teens
in Training

URING THE SUMMER MONTHS, a
D visitor driving through the hous-

ing areas of Keesler Air Force
Base, Biloxi, Mississippi, hears chil-
dren’s laughter, cries of “slide home,”
and other happy sounds from the play-
ground areas scattered throughout the
base. Directing the children in the
games and activities are trained leaders
recruited from the teenage dependents
of Keesler. Yes, teenagers!

Two years ago when Russell Ramage,
director of dependent youth activities
on the base, took over, he saw the need
for playgrounds as well as the organ-
ized teen activities, sports programs,
and scouting. He also saw the possi-
bility of developing leadership for the
program from the teenagers of the base.

In the fall of 1959, the junior coun-
selors group was formed. These young
people met once a week through the
fall and winter months to receive an
hour and a half of instruction in rec-
reation leadership. They were taught
recreation philosophy, game skills and
techniques, and crafts. They received
practical experience by helping with
special base-wide activities—Halloween
carnival, Easter egg hunt, etcetera.
They also assisted in the activities of
the sub-teen clubs. They were graded
on attendance, interest, personality,
leadership ability, and amount of volun-
teer time given.

By March 1960 they were ready to
participate in the play clinics which
were set up to screen the large number
of applicants for summer employment
(eleven playgrounds and two day
camps) . Personnel needed for the sum-

mer included college students, college
graduates, and teachers. Four classifi-
cations were used: instructors in spe-
cialized activities, senior counselors
(college graduates and teachers), jun-
ior counselors, and trainees—with a
corresponding salary scale).

BEGINNING IN MARCH, play clinics

were held each Saturday from 10-
12 and 1-3, with children of the base
invited to participate. All applicants
were required to attend two sessions,
donating one hour for each clinic. Ap-
plicants could conduct any activity of
their choicé and were graded on their
ability to handle children, knowledge
of program, personality, and ingenuity.

Junior counselors were required to
participate in these play clinics as su-
pervisors. The clinics reached a high
of 750 children from ages six to twelve.

Junior counselors who achieved the
required standards were hired in the
summer program. They worked in the
day camp program under adult coun-
selors or on the playgrounds as direc-
tors. As proof of their success, the play-
grounds showed a participation of
forty-two thousand youngsters for
seven weeks of operation.

In September 1960 another junior
counselor group was formed with a reg-
istration of sixty-five. In addition to
training sessions they assisted in the
after school program during the fall
and winter months by helping with
crafts, folk, square and ballroom danc-
ing for the subteens. Junior counselor
boys helped with sports.

During the time the junior counse-

lors group has been active, they have
attended two state recreation associa-
tion-sponsored workshops and a four-
day course in social recreation con-
ducted on the base by a National Rec-
reation Association field specialist.

Now CONCLUDING ITS SECOND YEAR,
the junior counselor training pro‘
gram has included meetings every Tues-
day evening — approximately forty
hours of training. The counselors have
studied playground management, how
to prepare lesson plans, first aid, care
of recreation equipment, games and
techniques of leadership. The course
was conducted by Mr. Ramage, Mrs.
Attwood H. Bolton, the assistant youth
director, and other qualified personnel.
Toward the end of the training ses-
sions each junior counselor conducted
activities of his choice for forty-five
minutes. He was graded according to
preparation and plan of work, interest,
suitability of activities, confidence.
poise, appearance, and leadership.

In addition to these, the final selec-
tion was based on volunteer help given
the youth program during the year,
education, experience, personal inter-
views, and references. Summer jobs are
based on total points earned.

This year the training course in-
cluded sixty-six high-school students.
011 May lst it was cut to thirty-five and
those finally selected began an addi-
tional twenty-hour course stressing
rules, policies, etcetera which specifi-
cally relate to Keesler. For the entire
recreation program at Keesler there has
been wonderful cooperation and back-

527

ing from the military, the base com-
mander, commander of the air-base
group, and personnel services oflicer.

THE SMALL SALARIES the young peo-

ple receive for summer employ-
ment are just a part “of the benefits they
derive from their work as junior coun-

selors. It is impressive to see them de-
velop self-confidence, leadership abil-
ity, and consideration for others. They

progress from unsure young adults to
a maturity and self-reliance uncommon
in young people of their years. They
are well on their way to becoming re-
sponsible adults.

In addition to personal gain, the en-

help. Although the aim of the junior-
counselor program is to qualify them
for summer jobs in base recreation ac-

Christmas in the City of Angels .,

Los Angeles celebrates a sunny and fun-packed Yule

THERE ARE NO “White Christmases” in Los Angeles, the
City of Angels, but the spirit of the season pervades
as youngsters and adults join, as elsewhere, in celebrating
the birth of the Christ Child and visits from Santa Claus.
Christmas activities at facilities operated by the Los An-
geles City Recreation and Park Department get underway
shortly after Thanksgiving, when boys and girls begin re-
hearsals for pre-Yule plays, and continue through New
Year’s Day (see scene at left).

More than five hundred Christmas parties, plays, and
community night programs are scheduled each year at Los
Angeles’ 112 municipal playgrounds for preschool young-
sters, older children, teenagers, senior citizens, and other
adults. These special events, which totaled 563 in 1960,
are in addition to normal playground activities for young-
sters which continue throughout December and are stepped
up considerably during Christmas vacation from schools.
Both the religious and the secular aspects of the Christmas
season are stressed at the various pre-Yule special events,
with youthful thespians presenting such plays as The Great-
est Gift, The Least of These, and Christmas Carol, and, on
the lighter side, What Happened in Toyland, The Snowman,
and Always a Santa.

One of the traditional Christmas activities sponsored by
the Los Angeles City Recreation and Park Department is
the presentation of “The Christmas Star” at Griffith Park
Observatory. The sky as it appeared over Bethlehem nearly
two thousand years ago is reproduced on the seventy-five-
foot domed ceiling of the observatory’s planetarium theater,
through the magic of the Zeiss planetarium machine, and
the story of the Nativity is recounted. To many Los Angeles-

RECREATION

 

RECREATION SITE SELECTION

Richard I. McCosh

osr RECREATION WORK calls for a
M good deal of pre-planning. This
is particularly true in site selection.
You must know before you start what
the needs and objectives of your organ-
tion are; you must have a list of re-
quirements on where, how many, and
what type sites are needed. With such
a program you can make constructive selections of the best

 

sites available.

Begin the examination of a site with a good map and
aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more and
more available through the work of counties and other gov-
ernment agencies. The new editions of topographic maps
being made by the federal government are excellent for
orienting yourself to the natural features of the site. These
are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological
Society, Washington 25, D. C. In recent years many coun-
ties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos
which show features in detail and are very good for plan-
ning use. Most counties also have maps available from
the county engineer showing roads and other features and
from the assessor’s office showing ownerships of land.

Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year
when the area will be most heavily used for recreation.
This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the

climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the
water interests, etcetera, which vary greatly with the sea-
sons. It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the
field, showing the size and location of the features of in-
terest and to take photographs at the site. These are a
great aid for planning use back at the office.

0R SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified
F and exPerienced park planner to carry through the
study. However, there is also much to be gained by mak-
ing use of the abilities of the local peOple who are available
and interested in recreation. County judges, commission-
ers, engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the
area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regard-
ing the site or opinions to offer from their varied profes-
sional experiences. A visit to the site by a group of sev-
eral persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opin-
ions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation
area.

How much study is required? This, of course. depends
on the character of the site itself, the previous experience
of the investigator, and the number of factors needed to
arrive at a good decision. It is too easy for the inexPeri-
enced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of
the area and base a decision on these alone. L'sually there
are more factors to good site planning than first impres-
sions. A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece
of desert in appearance today but have excellent poten-
tials for the future with a little development or water. The

529

 

same is true of areas which at first look good because of a
few existing recreation features but may actually be poor
areas to develop for general public use.

In looking for the best sites available that meet the re-
quirements, you need information to compare the site with
others. You need answers to four important questions.

0 What are the existing recreation features?

0 How well can the site be developed?

0 How useful will it be to the public?

o Is this site available?

Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation
Naturally, a park
site with scenic views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes,
will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees
and dunes. Quality is vitally important. Frontage on a
body of clear, clean water will be vastly different from the
same amount of frontage on polluted water. Some recrea-
tion features, such as scenic values and water interest, also

interests already existing at the site.

have greater overall value than other interests.

One of the most desirable features for a park are beau-
tiful views or scenery. It may be distant views of a valley
or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake,
A site which
overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the ac-
tivities of boating traffic. An area on the coast may have
relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach. A site
may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees
and shrubs. Note extent of these interests and how avail-
able they will be for the public to enjoy.

Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you
can find for a recreation site. Most park planners look
to water frontage for basic park areas. This follows natur-

colorful rock formations, or unusual trees.

ally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake provides
scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recrea-
tion activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water
sports. A body of water is usually the center of interest at
parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use.
It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and
wild life.

The amount of water frontage, the quantity and quality
of the water, and the recreation afforded by it are impor-
tant. A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area
for public use. The quantity of water flow may be critical;
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may

become stagnant or dry in late summer. If the site is on
a reservoir, the level of the water at various seasons as it
affects recreation should be studied. Check the quality
of the water. A stream which has all of its watershed with-
in a national forest or other lands under good conserva-
tion practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than
one passing through unrestricted logging 0r past an indus-
trial area. Other factors, such as water temperature, depth

of water, the fish life it supports, wave action, flooding, -

etcetera, will affect its recreation value.

_ O THER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest

are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast,
beaches, sand dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with
which the area is blessed. Just as the national and state
parks place emphasis on features which are of national or
state significance, counties should seek out these features
which are distinctive of their area. Although the site may
not contain the features themselves, there are often oppor-
tunities to include them as additional interest to the site.
The route to the park may lead people past them or display
views of them. A group of native trees or plants which are
outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the
site. i
The fish, animals, and birds which may be found at the
site are another interest. Fishing interest calls for a check
of the species found, quantity and size, the season they are
available, and the stocking program of the fish commission.
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in
nearby areas. The site may be on one of the major flyways
of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life. Clams,

crabs, and other marine life may add interest at coastal
areas.

E ACH AREA has its own historical interests with which
much can be done. Park visitors are always eager to

fr-

learn more about the area they are in. The historical sign\

tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as
some of the original historical items or places themselves
which still have the character of the period covered. N o-
tice should be taken of unusual rock formations, deposits,
or shapes of the earth’s crust in your region. Those which
tell a story of the earth’s formation in each area can add

t

i

geological interest to the recreation sites. An old ship-
wreck, a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find
gates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold,
.' etcetera may be of interest. Some areas may provide archeo-
logical values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunt-
ing areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.

How well can the site be developed? Look at the physical
features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use,
what can be done to correct the faults, and what it will cost
to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other
sites. Many things need to be checked:

   

Size and Shape—The size of the area alone can be a de-
termining factor. An area may be too small for the needs
of the project. Areas should be large enough to include
the attractions, have ample space for the use of facilities
needed, and have room around the edges to protect the
values of the area from encroachment by private develop-
ments. Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice
as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it
is often more economical to operate one large area than
several small ones.

Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions
and needs of the development. A large picnic area or camp-
ing development is most efficient in shape as a square or
rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a
long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide. This
is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that
your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions.
However, a narrow strip may be very practical for small
developments, or to provide additional stream frontage for
a fisherman’s trail, or include scenic strips within the park
unit.

Adjoining Areas—The values of the site may be affected
by the appearance of the adjoining lands, ownership and
use of the land, and the utilities available there. For in-
stance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such
as a national forest or a public road, may be desirable,
whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not. The
utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost
of extending electricity or water to the site.

Topography—Topography is very important. Check the
elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes,
drainage, rock outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well
as subsoil. Nearly level areas are required for parking areas,
beaches, camp areas, ballfields, etcetera. Determine how
much the topography limits useful area or what the costs

of earth moving or grading might be.

Water—In addition to its recreation interests, water is
needed for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation. The quan-
tity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in

site selection. The area may provide good springs or op-
portunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines.

Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas.

Plants—The existing plant growth calls for thorough
checking. Look at the trees as to size and interest, the

DECEMBER, 1961

amount of shade they provide, how healthy the) are, the
problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw. etcetera.
An area may have been partially logged and requires re-
moval of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of good
landscaping value, other areas of brush may need to be
cleared. The extent and location of open areas is noted.

Exposure—How much will wind, rain, sun, and tempera-
ture affect the use? An area sheltered from strong winds
may be highly desirable for recreation use. The direction.
velocity; and season of these Winds should be noted as to
just how they will affect the recreation use and your main-
tenance and operation of the area. Lack of rainfall and

 

Wetlands and bird ltje add interest to a possible site, such
as Caddy’s Coose Refuge in. A usonville, North Carolina. At
coastal areas marine file provides an engrossing study

extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade
and irrigation of a site to make it useahle. Sometimes. you
have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography
or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning
sun, or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended.

Improvements—Some areas may already have been im-
proved and contain buildings, roads, utilities, cleared land.
etcetera which may raise the cost of the site. If they can
be used in the recreation development or resold, this amount
can be discounted from the costs. If not, their removal adds

to the costs.
Access—Examine access both as regards the routes to the
site and the various recreation interests within the area.

The type and condition of roads leading to the area will
greatlv influence the usefulness of the sites. Safe and con-
venient access points are needed to handle public traffic.

531

 

Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park
areas. Here, Pennsylvania has taken advantage of its limited
Lake Erie shoreline to create Presque Isle State Park.

Some recreation interests within the site may be almost in-
accessible due to steep ground or other barriers such as a

roadway or river which divides the property.

U ndesirable F eatures—Few sites are without undesirable
features—it is difficult to list all of the possibilities. Make
note of some of the following:
Physical barriers: cliffs, flooding, swamps, bodies of water,
ditches, dunes, blow sand, slide areas, etcetera.
Hazards: traffic, fire, falling tree branches, water currents
or wave action, deep holes, insects, snakes, ticks, poisonous
plants, animals, cliffs, hunting, water pollution, high voltage
lines, etcetera.
Annoyances: noise (trains, airplanes, automobiles, trucks),
. dust, water algae, turbidity, pollen, aquatic weeds, smoke,
fumes, etcetera.
Others: objectionable views, existing structures not adapt-
able to park use, stumps and logging debris, driftwood,
nearby liquor-dispensing establishments, lack of usable area,
small size (no expansion space, shade lacking or limited),
exposure protection lacking, erosion, reservoir water-level
fluctuations, lack of water and utilities, poor access, objec-
tionable easements or land use, cattle grazing encroachment,
items required for maintenance but not necessary to increase
enjoyment of area, highway relocation, lack of traffic con-
trols, etcetera.

Many of these will not seriously limit use and can be
corrected or controlled. A sand dune can be stabilized, a
swamp drained, mosquitoes sprayed, pollution reduced, et-

532

cetera. The added cost of correcting these features may ,
be in the public interest other than just for the park use

itself.

Potential Developments—The planner will need to de-
termine how well the site is adapted to the kind of recreation
use we seek to provide. What portions of the site are suited
to parking area, picnic use, camping use, active games, na-:i
tural area, roads, trails, etcetera. Note the additional feast
tures of interest which can be enjoyed by the public over:
and above the basic needs. For cost estimate comparison,
of sites, prepare an overall plan of the circulation of rpads, a

basic facilities, and deve10pment work needed.

Maintenance and Operation—A part of the figuring of
the deve10pment will be how the site is to be maintained and '_
Operated. Will additional personnel, housing, and new serv-
ice equipment be I‘equired or is the area located so existing
nearby crews can be utilized?

A preliminary estimate of the costs of providing equal
facilities at one area in comparison with another site is re-
quired to bring out how much the various site conditions
affect the overall cost. This cost comparison will need to
include the acquisition of land, development of the site, and
its maintenance and operation.

How useful and important will the site be to the public?

(_ In order to estimate attendance and other benefits, check

the p0pulation, the economy, how good the access is, tourist
travel, the degree of interest in the recreation attractions
provided, how badly the site is needed, and the benefits the
development might create.

Location of the site with relation to population centers
will determine how many pe0ple are served by the area.
There is a definite relationship between the number of peos
ple close to the area and the attendance, but it is only one
factor. Figures on the rate of growth of p0pulation will also
give a clue on future needs within a given area. Recreation
interests of the people, how much time and money they have,
and what parts of the state they like to visit will also affect
the use.

Convenience of access to the recreation site greatly affects
the use. Good access from main travelled routes increases
the Opportunity for heavy use. Sites which are difficult to
reach are apt to have a very limited use. The amount of
existing traffic on roads can serve as a guide to the potential
attendance. The state highway departments have traffic flow-
charts of the main highway routes helpful in comparing
road traffic and routes of heavy tourist travel.

Although some sites may be remote today, they may be
opened up by new routes in the future. Improved access
routes and transportation are continually extending the dis-
tance which pe0ple will travel to find recreation.

Another factor in figuring potential attendance is the na-’
ture of the recreation attractions. What is the quantity and
quality of recreation features at the area? How do the facili-
ties compare with other areas? Will the public have such
a pleasing experience at the area that they will want to re-

visit it again or to tell others about it? A site with a variety ,-
\‘

RECREATION

n.

of features for people of all ages and providing popular ac-
tivities has a distinct use advantage over an area of limited
interest.

What is the need for recreation in this area? How badly
and how soon is it needed? Perhaps another public agency
has plans to develop a site nearby. In such a case, your
development may be unnecessary or can be combined in
such a manner that one helps the other.

SOMETIMES WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE the full value of a rec-
reation development. A good park can stimulate the
economy of an area by raising the adjoining land values,
attracting tourists, and holding them in an area long enough
that they spend more money in the region, and increases the
money spent on recreation equipment, supplies, etcetera.
Improvements made to an area in the form of improving and
maintaining roads or scenic values, protecting watersheds,
stabilizing sand dunes, draining swamps that breed mos-
quitoes, etcetera can have value to the surrounding area as
well.

Some areas which would make good recreation sites are
not available or would be too expensive in cost for the bene-
fits offered. Certain publicly owned properties, such as mil-
itary reservations, game reserves, etcetera may not be avail-
able to other agencies. A number of private properties are
too highly developed to purchase at a cost reasonable for
recreation. Sometimes, however, these sites may later be-

@ADMINISTRATION

 

come available as they are declared surplus to government
needs, or improvements decrease in value. Ownership and
availability must be checked and sometimes an appraisal
must be made of the current market value of the property.
Ownerships should be examined for easements, right of way,
reservations of mineral rights, etcetera, to make sure that
nothing would impair the usefulness of the area for a park.

Even though your funds may be limited, there are always
other opportunities which make it possible to reach recrea-
tion objectives. Lands may be leased for a long term rather
than purchased, easements for recreation use obtained, or
land exchanges worked out. Sometimes a site may be pur-
chased as a rock source for highway construction without
losing its usefulness for recreation use later. A scenic view-
point turnout might be made as part of new highway con-
struction as little or no cost by using removed rock or fill
material in the road construction. Agencies such as the US.
Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, etcetera may
have sites available to an agency which will maintain them.
Donation of land, funds, or lab0r are often available or can
be promoted for recreation and the public good.

Your parks reflect the amount of study and good judg-
ment used in selecting the sites. Poor ones will become
inefficient areas with problems that can’t be solved. Good
areas will grow in interest for the future. If you choose
the better sites you can develop a balanced. flexible program
which will best serve the public’s needs. #

 

As THE PRESSURES of civilization mount, it would seem to me that we probably have as much
need for part—time Thoreaus as we have for full—time nuclear scientists. Since the beginning
of mankind, people have always drawn great strength from their nearness and kipship to nature.
If we close off this source of strength by plowing under our scenic resources, we may soon find our—
selves so bafiled by the pressures of urbanization, that we risk damage to our character as a people
and therefore to our institutionS.—GENERAL OMAR NELSON BRADLEY.

Recreation market for prefab

steel buildings is soaring

Prefabricated

Steel
Buildings

HE BURGEONING GROWTH of recreation—already a
$40,000,000,000 market—is sparking a major boom
in the construction'of prefab steel buildings for skat-

ing rinks, marinas, bowling alleys, and similar facilities.
Prefabs reduce building cost and speed erection. A leading
manufacturer* reports the recreation market for steel build-
ings has doubled in each of the past three years and is ex-
pected to keep growing at least as fast in the future.

The growing popularity of steel prefabs is the result of
a major “revolution” in steel building design, manufactur-
ing and distribution. Only a few years ago these structures
were rightly considered “tin sheds.” Manufacturers offered
only a limited line of standard buildings, almost devoid of
style, with little or no provisions for integration with con-
ventional building materials. Now, imaginative integration
of conventional masonry with steel panels produces attrac-
tive styling.

Today, the steel-building industry is reaping the benefits
from heavy investments it made over the last few years to
upgrade design, manufacturing, and construction. Archi-
tects can now choose thousands of combinations of lengths,
widths, heights, wall and roof coverings, roof slopes, fram-
ing systems, colors, and textures. Introduction of computer
analysis has enabled engineers to design framing that costs
less to fabricate and erect, yet maintains the same strength.
Assembly-line production now turns out framing and cover-
ing components at a fraction of the costs of the old systems.

These changes have catapulted prefabs into the center of
a $250,000,000 industry, which represents about $1,000,-
000,000 construction.

With recreation growing so fast, ease of expansion is a
must. A steel building can be easily enlarged with no costly
problems of supporting the old roof by simply demounting
one side of the building and later re-erecting it on the ex-
tended frame. Because of increased demand, manufacturers
have established networks of dealers and contractors cap-

While the changeover from the “tin shed” to the more _,

most complete, manufacturers are already at work creating
new designs to meet changing needs. This capacity to con-

metal buildings manufacturers’ most potent weapon in their
efforts to secure a greater share of the recreation market
during the coming years. if:

THERE ARE SEVERAL reasons why

the need for setting aside more

open spaces for recreation is ur-
gent. The first is that as urban commu-
nities expand farther and farther into
the country it becomes more and more
difficult for urban dwellers to enjoy
contact with nature. This is especially
unfortunate in View of the increasing
amount of leisure which many people
have. What is the value of spending
less time in making a living if we have
no more ways of enjoying life?

It is said that at present recreational
facilities in the form of parks are lack-
ing in southern Ontario, except in the
Ottawa area, to an extent unparalleled
by any other major population center
in North America. Our people, in the
main, are forced by the lack of nearby

LAND USE PLANNING

Our Canadian neighbors recognize its urgency

 

facilities to make the long trek to the
northern lakes, adding to highway con-
gestion.

According to a report on land use
prepared by the Conservation Council
of Ontario, it is estimated that as a min-
imum there should be ten acres of read-
ily accessible (less than fifty miles
away) park for each one thousand pop-
ulation. In the Oshawa-Toronto-Ham-
ilton-St. Catharines belt, based on to-
day’s population, forty-two thousand
acres of rural parks are deemed neces-
sary. By the year 2000 this would in-
crease to ninety-six thousand acres. At
present the total is about three thousand
acres. Compare this with sixty thou-
sand acres for the Chicago area, and
fifteen thousand acres for Detroit.

THE DEMAND for outdoor recrcation
is increasing at a tremendous rate.
For instance, in one year 550,000 people
visited Point Pelee National Park which
has an area of five square miles. Be-
tween 1958 and 1959 there was an
eighty-percent increase in the numbcr
of Ontario people who visited the pro-

vincial parks. From 1957 to 1959 there
was a 141 percent increase in park
visitors.

Each of us can contribute to the solu-
tion of this problem. We should ask
ourselves, if no one does any more
about this than I do, will it ever be
solved? Each can help to form public
opinion by talking about this nccd and
the inadequacy of present action. When
enough people are informed and de-
mand action, something will be done.
One of the ways public Opinion is
formed is by word of mouth from pcr-
son to person. All of us can help in
this way.

Then if opportunity olfcrs we can
speak to groups of people. Also, we
can support organizations such as the
Federation of Ontario Naturalists, who
are cngaged in public education. and
who bring before governing bodies‘
municipal, provincial and fctlcralhthc
importance of setting aside adequate
areas for recreation. The reason these
organizations are not more effective is
that too many people lcavc it to others

to support them.

to the galaxy of supervised pro-

Illinois, Playground and Recreation
Department. The Playground and Rec-
reation Board of Commissioners have
inaugurated a supervised playtime pro-
gram for the mentally and physically
handicapped children in the area. Aware
that planned recreation for exceptional
children was an uncharted field, they
made staff and equipment available in
the summer of 1960 for an experimental
recreation program for handicapped

children.

RECREATon

From the time a child is born, his de-
sire and natural impulse for play is
a driving force in the development and
growth of his personality and body. As
a group, children with mental and phys-
ical handicaps have been denied this es-
sential outlet and have little contact
with other children, handicapped or
normal. A supervised play program,
such as Aurora’s, allows expression in
diverse ways. For many, particularly
those who are unable to attend school,
it provides one of the few opportunities
for social contact outside of the home.

Comparatively few planned play pro-
grams for physically and mentally
handicapped children are being oper-
ated throughout the nation. Because of
the many degrees of mental handicaps,
recreation personnel have been reticent
about even trying to present planned
programs for this groUp. The McCor-
mick Foundation research project on
recreation activities for handicapped
children proved that such activities
plannedand designed for these young-
sters were beneficial to an outstanding
degree. Medical scientists and educa-
tors recognize the fact that exceptional
children are upgraded mentally when
associated in group activities and be-
lieve that stimulation, competition, and
socialization may play their respective
parts in the process.

LAYING ON A PLAYGROUND is such a
normal childhood privilege that
few people realize that some youngsters
cannot cope with routine playground
programs. Therefore, in the summer of
1960 the Playground and Recreation
Board of Commissioners designed a
play program to be conducted in a re-
served playground totlot twice a week
for a seven-week period. On apparatus
scaled to the prOper size, handicapped
children could swing, slide, ride on
merry-go-rounds, bounce on spring
horses, and build sand castles to their
heart’s content. The fenced area, super-
vised by volunteers under the direction
of department personnel, provided safe
play-space for those youngsters who
needed a sheltered play area.

The program proved to be so much
fun for the children that the depart-
ment decided to put it on a continuing
basis for the fall and winter, and to
schedule one program a month in the
Aurora Recreation Center. With the
volunteer cooperation of the Aurora
Alumni Group of the Delta Zeta Soror-
ity, programs were featured on the
fourth Saturday of each month from
September through January.

The operation of the program and its
proved worth attracted the attention of
John Sacuto, executive director of Unit-
ed Cerebral Palsy of Greater Chicago,
during the United Cerebral Palsy Fund
Drive in Aurora. Since then, arrange-
ments for cosponsorship and program
augmentation by United Cerebral Palsy
has made a weekly program possible for

the children.

THE PROGRAM has expanded and is
now conducted each Saturday from
9:30 until 1:30. The longer period of
time has permitted the professional staff
to introduce more varied craft, music,
and game programs. The wonderful fun
of eating sack lunches with a group of
one’s friends is also possible for the
youngsters since the program runs
through the lunch hour. Necessary
medications are administered by trained
staff members who aid the severely crip-
pled unable to feed themselves.

After the flag raising ceremony, or-
ganized play in active ball and table
games gets under way. Crutches and
wheelchairs are no handicap to partici-
pants because supervisors are on hand
to retrieve balls and help fit balls into
hands not as flexible as they should be.
The healthy shouts, yells, and shrieks of
laughter during the apparently wild
games are the same joyful sounds that
can be heard on any active playground.

The music hour gathers all ages and
groups into a huge circle. Wheelchairs,
big chairs, and little chairs seat each
child comfortably so that they can join
in the exciting rhythm band—kazoos,
sandboxes, cymbals, bells, and triangles.
“Making music” is a soul satisfying ex-
perience for young and old.’ The young-
sters frequently are the center of the
stage when they sing solos. The pro-

Program, as such, is never allowed
to interfere with sheer fun. If it is more
fun to sit at a table and look at beauti-
ful pictures of trains than to go to the
craft room to make a belt or weave, the
train pictures win! Day-dreaming is

played, and there will be a storytelling

partment has designed and built
special equipment—a walker, railed

dials and foot pedals, supply cards and
cabinets, and special tables for the en-
joyment of handicapped youngsters.
Plans for outdoor play activities are
now being made. Since its inaugura-
tion last summer with about sixteen
children, the playtime has grown stead-
ily with a registration of well over fifty
children. EXpanded facilities and broad
play programs will help these children
to enjoy the summer months on the oh-
so-normal basis of “going to the play-
ground.”

The primary interest of the Play-
ground and Recreation Board of Com-
missioners is to provide recreation pro-
grams in areas of need. However. the
resultant therapeutic value in the lives
of handicapped children has been rec-
ognized throughout the community.

The activity, under the direction of

and supervised by Mrs. June Bennett.
assistant department director and pro-
gram supervisor, is augmented by
trained staff members provided through
the cooperation of the United Cerebral

staff, together with many volunteer men

a new lease to happiness for a most de-
serving section of the city’s youth. #

Teach Children to Ski

Continued from Page 526
——___.._.._______

balance their weight so they are not
lifted off the ground. In a Chairlift, the
small child can be taken up on the in-
structor’s knees.

As soon as class members are good
enough to follow one another, form a

‘line, with the fastest ones in front,

slower ones behind; then ski down
follow-the-leader. When they all learn
better control, spot one with better tech-
nique in front of one with poorer tech-
nique.

Children like movement, swinging
around. The first christy they learn is
usually the christy stop—the emergency
stop! As soon as you see this, notice it,
emphasize it every time they stop. Show
them that they can do the same thing
coming down the hill by imagining they
are about to stop, but not quite, to pre-
tend to stop one way, and then the
other, all the way down. Then try a
few rhythm bounce, pole,
bounce, pole, for a long distance. Be-
fore they know it, they are doing short
parallel christys.

turns;

Developing Bounce:

Once in a while, however, we run
into a child who has no bounce; legs
rigid like cast iron, boots six inches
ahead of his knees. He can do a solid
snOWplow turn and stop on a wide, gen-
tle hill this way, and sees no reason to
ski any other way. And it’s fun to fall
in the snow!

One way to cure this is to pick out
a small bump, maybe a foot high, and
show him how to ride over it, then how
to jump it. He only has to land hard
once with straight legs, and he won’t
want to feel that shock again. If he
does this often enough, he’ll get into
the habit of bending his knees—and
discover the christy — and then he’s
away.

Now take him over a series of evenly
spaced, round bumps, first trying to
stay on the ground over each one, then

jumping off the last one, then sliding

around them, one after the other. The
airplane turn is a good way to give the
right spring to the knees of the child.
The necessity for extreme flexibility and
quick leg action helps to overcome

straight legs between turns, or a braced
lower leg.

Racing and Competition:

Most children have a very keen sense
of competition. Once a child can do a
good christy, nothing improves and dis-
ciplines his skiing like slalom; and ski-
ing against a clock, against other chil-
dren, makes him find out for himself
that to win, or even make a good show-
ing, he has to learn the technique; to
think as well as just ride down the hill;
to climb the course.

Children doing snowplow turns can
be sent through an easy, open slalom
course, too; they love it. But only as
an exercise, not against a clock. Timing
tends to hurry them, and makes them
worse instead of better at that stage.
Similarly, in teaching slalom to a
christy class, it is best that they practice
without being timed, until they can get
through the gates without too much
fighting and Hailing of arms and legs.
Then run them down against the clock,
so they’ll learn to pick the fastest line
without any wasted movement.

Slalom teaches them quick reactions,
to ski light, with rhythm in regulated
turns, rather than a long turn here and
a short, erky turn there. Once they can
run slalom well, they can ski any hill,
because they learn to check at any given
speed, or steepness, or angle of descent.

And when the child has mastered his
skis, the whole family, sometimes three
generations, can have marvelous vaca-
tions together, each enjoying his own
level of skiing, and gathering at the end
of the day with the feeling of well-being
ever'y ski family knows so well. #

WE WANT outdoor recreation at
all times of our lives . . . from
the time We are children, exploring
with “terrifying energy,” until the
time we are content to sit and con-
template the” scene and feel the
warmth of the sun and the coolness
of the breeze. We are a part of the
earth and its life. We sense it, we
know it, we revel in it. We do not
worship it but we love it and that is
something which everyone of us un-
derstands in every other.—BEN H.
THOMPSON, Chief, Division of Rec-
reation Resource Planning, National
Park Service.

backing paper may be peeled off and the second surface at-
tached. Being pressure-sensitive, it forms a tight, permanent
bond instantly between any combination of materials, except
those with oily or waxy surfaces. The adhesive strip is not
moist, will not warp paper, or jam office equipment. It can
even be used to hold microfilm records to date-processing
equipment. To apply adhesive, pull out tape at indicated
cutting edge; put tacky side on object and unroll to desired
length; pinch package, cutting tape with rotary, pulling mo-
tion. Then rub strip so that adhesive binds firmly to sur-
face; peel off carrier strip at the dry edge, exposing second

AN INESTIMABLE TREASURE for every recreation
leader and department having anything to do
with drama, Drama with and for Children by
Winifred Ward is a manual on creative drama
and children’s theater. It explains the why,
it tells how and when and what; it examines
and interprets the relationship between the
two types and the role of each in the develop-
ment of the child. Prepared for the U.S. De—
partment of Health, Education, and Welfare,
it is available for $.30 (no stamps) from the

Government Printing Office, Washington 25,
D. C.

RECREATION DEPARTMENTS or other agencies
conducting or planning to conduct preschool
recreation programs will find some excellent
guidelines in Standards for Day Care Service.
Chapter 4, for example, sets up a clear state-
ment on the principles of planning the daily
program and the opportunities that the pro-
gram should provide the children three to six
years of age. Appendix B is a very useful list-
ing of indoor furnishings, equipment, and sup-
plies, as well as indoor and outdoor play
equipment recommended for a group of fifteen
youngsters. Available for $1.59 from Child
Welfare League of America, 345 East 46th

Rhythmic Activities—Series |ll,*
Frances R. Stuart and Virginia Gibson.

Burgess Publishing Company, 426
South Sixth Street, Minneapolis 15.
Portfolio of 78 indexed cards. $2.50.

These dances might be done by upper
elementary and junior-high students
who are familiar with the basic rhythms
of polka, schottische, waltz, two-step,
etcetera. Many of the dances would
seem too difficult for youngsters unfa-
miliar with basic rhythms.

The card file format is good and easy
to use. The record listings for each
dance are helpful and the address list
of record companies and glossary of
dance terms add to the portfolio’s use-
fulness.

If the arrangement of the sixty
dances were in order of difIiculty rather
than in alphabetical order it would be
more helpful to the recreation leader.
Also, some indication of counts is
needed. Working out the steps by mea-
sures is not easy to do unless one knows
the time signature of the record and
how many counts to the measure. The
collection has good variety representing
fifteen different countries, as well as
American mixers and couple dances.

I would hesitate to recommend the
material to a beginning teacher or an
unskilled group. For some situations
it is very usable-——and if Rhythmic Ac-
tivities—Series II had been used first,
a group would doubtless be ready for

Series III.——Helen M. Dauncey.

McClintock. Public Affairs Press, 419

3, D.C. Pp. 480, illustrated. $8.00.

Toys are as old as man, but toy man-
ufacturing and the toy shop are rela-
tively recent. Toys in America is the
result of three years of study and re-
search, much of it spent studying the
sale of toys back as far as 1700 and
tracing the history of those craftsmen
and companies that first devoted their
energies to toy and game-making. Paul
Revere, for example, made silver teeth-
ing spoons, rattles, and whistles as well

as his famous silverware. Deming J ar-
vis delighted little girls with miniature
doll dishes made of Sandwich glass.

Throughout the book are fascinating
vignettes: the story of A. C. Gilbert,
“the man who saved Christmas for chil-
dren”; the story of the Teddy bear, the
billiken doll, the kewpie doll, Lionel
trains, “Slinky,” and hundreds of oth-
ers, including the many types of guns,
sleds, models, noisemakers, pull-toys
and table games that delight children in
every era. In 1950, toy sales were a
minimum of a billion and a quarter, far
outstripping business as a whole in the
same period.

Books like this and Peepshow to Par-
adise, an English book published some
time ago which covered the history of
toys over two thousand years of civil-
ization, are highly important to the rec-
reation profession. They do not teach
skills or techniques. They do not set
standards for leadership, administra-
tion, or program. However, they ac-
complish a great and important task.
They show‘ us—or remind us—that the
need for, and the interest in, play is a
fundamental; that the child of ancient
Egypt with her clay doll, the little Amer-
ican Indian girl with her cornhusk doll.
and today’s child with her washable
doll-with-a-permanent-wave are one and
the same. As the book points out, sta-
tions in outer space are still dreams in
adult life—hut any child can buy them
in a toy store!———V.M.

Cunningham has given the original

sketches, too, are simple but full of
vitality.

The title would lead us to believe

cluding firemaking, sketches, exploring.

Masks and Mask Makers,* Kari Hunt
and Bernice Wells Carlson. Abingdon
Press, 201 Eighth Avenue South, Nash-
ville, Tennessee. Pp. 73, illustrated.

$2.75.

Everyone who ever saw "Masquerade
Party” on TV has seen Mrs. Hunt’s
masks; Mrs. Carlson has written a num-
ber of books, including the Junior
Party Book and Fun for One or Two.
This short but informative and inter-
esting book, explains the major uses
and reasons for masks in vivid fashion
—masks for disguise, transformation,
masks for the dead, for dramatic and
carnival use, and for protection. The
major portion of the book describes
masks as made and used in various
parts of the world—Eskimo and Amer-
ica, Indian masks, masks of Africa and
the South Pacific, masks of the Far
East, and masks in civilized Europe.
Excellent photographs of these wierd or
amusing creations add greatly to the
book’s interest and attractiveness.

If a parent asks you to recommend a
book of games and activities for every-
day use, plus ideas for holidays (includ-
ing the major Christian and Jewish
ones), here is the book. Written pri-
marily for use with youngsters six to
twelve years old, it covers such activi-
ties as simple crafts, storytelling. tricks,
etcetera.

A short appendix indicates by cross-
reference, games for one, and for two.
Asterisks throughout the book indicate
games for small groups and those need-
ing a larger number. The holiday sug-
gestions are simple, but contain some
good and original ideas. All in all. this
is an informal, but very pleasant game
