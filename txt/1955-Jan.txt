YOU CAN measure soil and you can
measure water and trees, but it is

difIicult to measure intangible values.

Let us define, if we can, what intangi-
ble values are. They are those which
stir the emotions; which influence our
happiness and contentment; values
which make life worth living. They are
concerned with the good life. We know
that they are so important that without
them life loses much of its meaning.

The practical considerations of con-
servation are important also. Surely we
cannot embark on any conservation or
nature protection program depending
on theory alone. Always back of such
efforts, however, are the other factors
which we call the intangibles. They
give substance to the practical and pro-
vide the reasons for everything we do.
Their values are so involved and in-
tegrated in all conservation and nature
protection work that it is impossible to
separate them.

There is no question about the intan-
gible values of works of art. We have
always recognized them. In the Chica-
go Art Institute, recently, I saw a wom-
an engrossed before a great painting.

'I'his editorial has been adapted from a talk
given before the 1954 National Convention
of the Izaak Walton Imague of America. held
in Chicago, and reprinted from the July-Sep-
tember 1,931- issne of National Parks Haga-
zine. \Ir. Olsen is prc-sident of the Vational
Parks Association.

She stood there in reverence. I looked
at her closely, and in her eyes was a
happy light.

What was she getting out of that pic-
ture? She was certainly not inter-
preting it in terms of the canvas, the
frame, or the oil and pigment the artist
had used. She was catching something
that inspired her as it has inspired many
others. She was enjoying the intangi-
ble values in that work of art. It af-
fected her deeply and that was all that
mattered.

Is it possible to explain the intangi-
ble values in a beautiful piece of music?
As you listen to a Beethoven sonata,
can you explain exactly what it does to
you? 7

Do you know why you like William
Cullen Bryant’s “To a Waterfowl”?

What do these lines mean to you?

Whither, ’midst falling dew
While glow the heavens with the last steps
of day . . .

I know what they mean to me. They
mean sunsets on the marshes, the whis-
per of wings . . . Bryant caught some-
thing in those lines, something which
you and I know, the intangible values
of ducks against the sky.

There have been many definitions of
conservation. Aldo Leopold said, “Con-
servation means the development of an
ecological conscience.” What I think
he meant was that unless man develops
a feeling for his environment and un-

THE
INTANGIBLE
VALUES

Protection

Sigurd F. Olson

derstands it, unless he becomes at one
with it and realizes his stewardship, un-
less he appreciates all of the intangible
values embraced in his environment, he
cannot understand the basic need for
preserving nature and wilderness.

I think of Louis Bromfield’s: “Con-
servation is living in harmony with the
land.” What is meant by “in harmony
with the land”? Certainly not the crea-
tion of dust storms, or gullies, or min-
ing the soil. It means living the good
life on the land, having the ability and
the understanding to enjoy the sights,
sounds, and smells of the land.

Paul Sears of Yale said, “Conserva-
tion is a point of view and involves the
whole concept of freedom, dignity, and
the American spirit.” A beautiful thing
to say and something that will be re-
peated for generations to come. The
conservation of resources, the protec-
tion of nature and wild land, reveal a
point of view—a philosophy and a way
of life.

What do we mean by our way of life?
Generations of Americans have enjoyed
the thing we call the good life. In fact,
we have taken it for granted as part of
our heritage without ever trying to de-
fine it or wonder where it came from.
This much we know, that the good life
is a life of plenty, of breathing space
and freedom, and for most Americans
it means the out-of-doors. If the open
country were taken away from us,

RECREATION

would we still be able to live the good
life?

Is our country heading toward a
state of mechanized civilization in which
the good life, as we understand it, is
going to disappear? Are we going to
mistreat our natural resources to the
point where it is no longer possible to
enjoy them?

I flew over the city of New York the
other day. The plane circled over the
miles and miles of tenements and slums
that are Brooklyn. I looked down and
thought of the children there who never
saw grass or trees or clean running wa-
ter, and wondered what they thought
about the good life, and if they knew,
or ever would know, what it meant.

I also saw Central Park that day, a
little green oasis surrounded by the
roaring, bustling city of New York.
That tiny natural area was worth un-
counted millions of dollars, but I knew
its intangible values to the people of the
city were far more important than any
others. Here was a sanctuary of the
spirit in the midst of one of the greatest
industrialized cities of the world.

How is all of this involved with the
conservation of our natural resources
and the protection of nature and wilder-
ness? What does it actually have to do
with the practical problems of soil and
water and living things? Sterling North
said: “Every time you see a dust cloud
or a muddy stream, a field scarred by
erosion or a channel choked with silt,
you are witnessing the passing of Amer-
ican democracy.” I would have added
to that statement fivewords— and our
way of life.

One of our great historians, in de-
scribing the migration of races from
east to west, said, “In dust and rubble
along those great migration lanes are
the palaces, pyramids, and temples of
the past.”

What happened to those ancient peo-
ples? They mistreated the land, their
forests and their waters, and thereby
lost their way of life.

It is easier for me to think of the in-
tangibles with reSpect to water than
with respect to most other resources, for
I have always lived close to it. I instinc-
tively think of my home, the Quetico-
Superior, and the wilderness canoe
country of the international border.
What is the importance of that country,

JANUARY 1955

its timber, its vast deposits of iron, and
other resources? There is no denying
the part this area plays in our economy,
but when I think of it, I remember the
vistas of' wilderness waterways, the soli-
tude and quiet, and the calling of the
loons. They are the intangible values
which someday in the future, with our
zooming population, may far outshad-
ow the others in importance.

Mention water, and I think of Izaak
Walton and the line in the stained-glass
window of the cathedral at Winchester,
England, where he is buried; only four
words there— “Study to be quiet”-—-
but they embodied his whole philos0phy
and way of life. Here was his search for
tranquillity and peace, the whole rea-
son for his communion with the out-of-
doors. He did not mention the number
of fish he caught. He remembered the
intangible values of the things he wrote
about

I visited Crater Lake, Oregon, last
summer, and I remember its startlingly
blue water, its high peaks and snow-
fields. I remember how it looked in the
early morning when it was half covered
with mist. Intangible values? Capture
them? You take them with you. How,
you do not know.

I remember a little trout stream of
a long time ago. I followed it to the
headwaters on the advice of an Indian
who told me I would find a pool that
no one had ever fished. I found that
pool after looking for it two whole days.
I have never been back there and I do
not want to go back, because I have
heard that the pool has changed.

There were great' trees around that
pool -— primeval yellow birch, huge
white pines, and hemlocks. It was a'rock
pool. I climbed out on a ledge and
looked down into its clear, deep‘ water.
On the bottom, schools of speckled trout
were lying and farming their fins. I sat
on that ledge for a long time and I
thought, “This is a part of America as
it used to be.”

It is hard to place a price tag on these
things, on the sounds and smells and
memories of the out-of-doors, on the
countless things we have seen and loved.
They are the dividends of the good life.

Have you ever stood in a virgin for-
est where it is very quiet and the only
sounds are the twittering of the nut-
hatches and kinglets away up in the

Editorial

tops? John Muir once said, “The se-
quoias belong to the solitudes and the
milleniums.” I was in the sequoias not
long ago and it was a spiritual experi-
ence. To realize that those great trees
were mature long before the continent
was discovered, that their lives reached
back to the beginnings of western civili-
zation, was sobering to short-lived man.

We need trees. We need them for
lumber, for industry, for paper. We
must have them for our particular kind
of civilization. They are an important
factor in our economy. But let us never
forget that there are values in trees oth-
er than the material, values that may be
more important in the long run.

You have heard that by 1970 there
will be a fifth mouth to feed at every
table of four. What is that going to do
to our way of life? What is it going to
do to the places where one can still find
silence and peace?

I read an editorial in the New York
Times last year, when the Supreme
Court of the United States made its fa-
vorable decision on the validity of the
air space reservation over the roadless
areas of the Superior National Forest,
in northern Minnesota. The heading of
the editorial was “Tranquillity is Be-
yond Price.” Tranquillity is one of the
intangibles. Solitude is also one of
them. Truly both are beyond price.

A.

Much of my time is spent in the ef-
fort to preserve wilderness regions of
the United States. They are the wild
areas set aside by the states and the fed-
eral government as forests and parks.
Constant effort is necessary to save them
from exploitation.

The fact that forty-six million pe0ple
visited our national parks, and over
thirty million our national forests last
year, indicates that there is a hunger, a
need in the American people, to renew
their associations with unspoiled na-
ture. We are trying to hold the line and
pass these areas on unimpaired to fu-
ture generations.

The protection of waters, forests,
soils, and wildlife are all involved with
the needs of the human spirit.

) PROBLEMS RELATED TO personnel
standards, registration, and profes-
sional membership will be discussed
when the Council for the Advancement
Of Hospital Recreation meets at Na-
tional Recreation Association head-
quarters Friday morning, February 18,
1955. At the November meeting, held
at National Education Association
headquarters in Washington, the coun-
cil recommended standards for hospital
recreation workers. The recommenda-
tions have been referred to the three
constituent professional organizations,
the Recreational Therapy Section of
AAHPER, the Hospital Section of ARS,
and the National Association of Recre-
ational Therapists, for approval. The
National Recreation Association serves
as consultant organization to the coun-

cil which was established in 1954.

) THE FIRST EDUCATIONAL FILM on the
therapeutic value Of recreation for pa-
tients in non-government hospitals is
scheduled for production this spring.
Funds for the project—which has been
developed by Mrs. Beatrice Hill, Na-
tional Recreation Association Hospital
Recreation Consultant —-— have been
made available by the Nathan Hof-
heimer Foundation of New York City.
- The script has been written by Mrs. Hill
and Robert Wald, producer Of the radio
series, “American Inventory.” Mr. Wald
will direct the film, which will be in
three reels, color and sound. '

) ATTEMPTs TO INVADE DINOSAUR NA-
TIONAL MONUMENT by inducing Con-
gress to authorize Echo Park Dam were
defeated decisively as Congress ad-
j ourned last fall. S. 1555, which would
have initiated the gigantic Upper Colo-
radO River Storage Project, was de-
bated on the Hoor of the Senate, but was
drOpped without a vote; H. R." 4449, the
companion bill, was held in the House
Rules Committee. This victory, which is
owing to the vigorous expression of
opinion from the people of every state,
emphasizes public insistence that our
national park system continue to be pro-
tected.

) A SURVEY OF CAMPS serving families,
adults, or mothers and children is bein g

6

undertaken by the American Camping
Association. Any such camps which
have not received a survey question-
naire are asked tO write for a copy tO the
American Camping Association, 343
South Dearborn Street, Chicago 4, Illi-
nois. One Of the objectives of this sur-
vey is to compile a directory of family
camps for distribution to interested
persons.

} PRESIDENT EISENHOWER HAS BEEN
URCED to “call together a group Of lead-
ing citizens and government officials—
federal, state, and local” to assist the
federal government in the development
Of a comprehensive federal policy and
program with respect to “human prob-

lems created by the national defense
effort.”

The proposal was made in a letter to
the President from Louis B. Seltzer,
editor Of the Cleveland Press and chair-
man Of the Board Of United Community
Defense Services, a federation of na-
tional non-profit health and welfare or-
ganizations. The letter accompanied a
thirty-six page report, “People and Na-
tional Defense,” which analyzes the fed-
eral government’s responsibilities for
the problems of social adjustment inten-
sified by the national defense effort.

) THE REPORT Retreation as a Profes-
sion in the Southern Region.* published
January 1955, will be the basis for a
special conference to be held February
20-22 in Atlanta, Georgia. Sponsoring
the conference will be the Southern
Regional Education Board and the Na-
tional Recreation Association. Con-
ferees will discuss the findings of the
report, and consider plans for a regional
action program to improve professional
education for recreation leadership.
Representatives Of interested grOups, or-
ganizations, and institutions are being
invited tO take part in the meeting, the
first Of its kind in recreation.

) SEVENTY-FIVE' BOUND VOLUMES OF
RECREATION MAGAZINE, of early

years, are available from the National
Recreation Association on a compli-

mentary basis. Recipients are asked to
pay the postage which amounts to
twenty cents per copy. The volumes

ciation would like to dispose of
promptly.

 

Painting by William Fisher

Because Of the interest shown in the
picture Of our new National Recreation
Association home, which appeared on
the cover of our December 1954 issue of
RECREATION, we would like to tell you a

Mr. Fisher has a studio across the
street from the Eight Street building
and is one Of our new neighbors. He
has not only participated in Greenwich
Village art shows for the last twenty
years, but has won one hundred prizes
for his oils and Water colors. His paint-
ings are represented in a number Of
leading collections, and are hanging in
the St. Louis, Missouri, and New Haven,
Connecticut, ,museums. He has illus-
trated stories for such magazines as the

NEW MEMBERS of the BOABD 0f DIRECTIDBS

The National Recreation Association is proud of the devoted, outstanding service given by the lay members of
its Board of Directors, the policy-making body of the National Recreation Association. The following mem-
bers have been recently elected to this board:

                  

Hodding Carter William C. Menninger Richard A. Farnsworth

Greenville, Mississippi Topeka, Kansas Houston, Texas

 

MR. CARTER, a well-known newspaperman, is a graduate of Bowdoin College, and has done graduate work
at Columbia, Tulane, and Harvard. He founded the Delta Courier in Hammond, Louisiana, and later the
Delta Star, and is now editor and publisher of the Delta Democrat-Times. As a publisher of a small town paper,
Mr. Carter has become nationally known for outspoken leadership on some of the nation’s basic problems——
political, economic, and social. He serves constantly on many varied committees and boards working for
community, state, and national objectives; and his leadership has had tremendous influence in the economic,
educational, and recreational advancement of Negroes in his area and throughout the South.

Mr. Carter received the Nieman Fellowship for Newspapermen at Harvard and is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
He is now a member of the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board; and he serves on the National Commission for
Public Schools. In addition to many magazine articles, he has written several books, the latest, Where Main
Street Meets the River, in 1953. His active interest in recreation and in community, national and international
affairs makes him a valuable addition to the National Recreation Association Board.

MR. F ARNSWORTH is chairman of the board of Farnsworth and Chambers, contractors, in Houston, Texas.
In addition to his wide business interest throughout the South, he is active in the fields of education, religion,
and race relations. He attended Tulane University and Washington University in St. Louis. He is president
of the Houston Council of Churches and vice-president of the Young Men’s Christian Association in Houston.
He is also a member of the Council of Christian Relations of the Presbyterian Church of the United States, a
member of the board of directors and vice-president of the National Council of Churches, a member of the bi-

racial board of trustees of Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and a member of the International Com-
mittee of the Young Men’s Christian Association.

Mr. Farnsworth comes to the board as an old friend, having served as Houston sponsor of the National
Recreation Association for eight years.

DR. MENNINGER is known nationally and internationally as an authority on mental health. He was edu-

cated at Washburn College, Kansas, and did graduate work at Columbia University and Cornell University
Medical School.

He has held numerous offices in societies and on committees working on various aspects of mental health,
including the presidency of the American Psychiatric Association and chairmanship of the Expert Advisory
Panel on Mental Health, World Health Organization. He is a trustee of the National Society for Crippled
Children and Adults, board member of the Boy Scouts of America, and the author of numerous books and
published scientific papers.

Dr. Menninger is a great believer in recreation, and has emphasized it both in preventative and curative
aspects of mental health. His address on recreation and mental health at the Omaha National Recreation
Congress, which was publisth in RECREATION, has been reprinted and used widcly in this country and trans-
lated in other lands. With his scientific background and wide expericncc in working on problems of childrcn,
youth, and adults he brings a special contribution to the board.

Request for Correspondence

Sirs:

I have recently been appointed as the
first warden secretary of a community
association in a rural district of Glou-
cestershire serving a population of
10,000 pe0ple. For a number of reasons
I am anxious to make some internation-

al contacts on behalf of the members
who consist of individual subscribers
and those affiliated (3,000) through
membership of social, educational, re-
ligious and political groups.

I am taking the liberty of writing to
you in the hope that you can give me
information or forward the content of
this letter directly to any communities
in the United States who might be in-
terested in an exchange of news and
thoughts with an English association.

Apart from the interest in exchanging
views, both for the adult and younger
members of our various groups, I have
a feeling that there is an urgent need
for social intercourse between indivi-
duals in both of our countries if we are
to survive the horrors of further ag-
gression which follow the trends of
wrong thinking which are being con-
stantly fanned by those irresponsible
extremists (in both directions) with fa-
natical doctrines resulting from periods
of uncertainty, which both follow and
precede wars.

Coleford is a small country town,
once a market center which, after a pe-
riod of depression, was revived by the
arrival of light industry. With the sur-
rounding villages, which form its ad-
ministrative area, it is situated in the
heart of the lovely Forest of Dean,
Hanked by the valleys of the Wye and

the Severn.

The management committee of the
community association in Coleford con-
sists of a retired schoolmaster, the edi-
tor of the local newspaper, a farmer, a
Chemist’s assistant, a ‘small mine’ own-
er, an Anglican Clergyman, a Non-
conformist minister’s wife, a consult-
ant engineer, the head of an old family
drapery business. Therein lies its
strength. There are so many more peo-
ple of various interests who have com-
bined in this great social adventure.

DAVID HOBMAN, Warden Secretary,
Coleford District Community Asso-
ciation, Coleford, Cloucestershire,

England.

Kind Words
Sirs:

. . . May I again compliment you on
the outstanding make-up of RECREA-
TION magazine. It is being more appre-
ciated with each issue. This does not
mean that it was not appreciated in the
past but, rather, that new heights have
been established.

CHARLES F. WECKWERTH, Director,

Youth Leadership, Recreation and

Community Services, Springfield

College, Springfield, Massachusetts.

Synchronized Swimming
Sirs:

Mrs. Norma Olson, who is national
chairman of synchronized swimming, is
a person to whom questions on the sub-
ject of synchronized swimming can be

referred. She can be reached at 919

McKinley Avenue, Oakland, California.
MIN HENDRICK, Director of Recrea-
tion, Niagara Falls, New York.

About the Editorial
Sirs:
You might be interested in the back-

ground of Mr. Olson’s editorial. [See‘

page 5—Ed.] This was delivered as a
talk by Mr. Olson at the annual meet-
ing of the Izaak Walton League of
America in Chicago last spring. It was
entirely extemporaneous, without notes,
and I have seldom seen an audience so
instantly in harmony with the speaker.
Actually, it suddenly became an almost
spiritual occasion. While the editorial
[condensed from the stenographic rec-
ord of what he said] conveys the
thoughts he expressed, it could not re-
construct the surge of feeling that all
of us who heard it experienced. I felt
very proud that Mr. Olson was speak-
ing as president of the National Parks
Association.

FRED M. PACKARD, Executive Secre-

tary, National Parks Association.

This Month’s Editorial

The editorial, “The Intangible Values
of Nature Protection,” by Sigurd F.
Olson, which appears on page 4 of this
issue of RECREATION, has an interesting

background. (See letter from Fred M. .

Packard, executive secretary of the N a-
tional Parks Association on page 9.)

Areas Invaded or Abolished

The American people do not know
that demands are constantly being made
by a misinformed portion of the public
for uses of the national parks and‘monu-
ments that were never intended, uses
that are in direct conflict with the ideal
of leaving them unimpaired for all
time. They are unaware of the power-
ful pressures that exist for the invasion
of such areas as Dinosaur National
Monument and Glacier and Olympic
National Parks.

The Father Millet Cross on the south-
ern shore of Lake Ontario is one exam-
ple of an area no longer regarded as
a national monument; another is the
Mount of the Holy Cross in the high
mountains of central Colorado; and an-
other, the former Wheeler National
Monument—an area of fantastic splen-
dor, also in Colorado. Even casual men-
tion of this last area, in fine type, is
omitted on today’s road maps.

In Mt. Rainier National Park the
landscape has been unnecessarily dis-
figured for, in places, roads have been
built where roads should never have
been built—along slopes too steep for
construction. Gaping scars can be seen
for miles—scars that can never heal be-
cause cuts are too steep or in solid rock.
Further proposals are to invade the
park with a tramway and other “im-
provements.”

A storm of protest has arisen over
tactics used to pass the multi-billion
dollar Upper Colorado River Storage

10

Project through Congress before sound
appraisal. This project includes the
construction of Echo Park Dam within
Dinosaur National Monument. This
park is considered by many to be the
scenic climax of this national monu-
ment. According to National Parks
Magazine, “The Echo Park aspect of
the project contains such inept plan-
ning, the question arises as to whether
equally serious errors may not exist in
the computation of other dams.”

Dinosaur Films

The National Parks Association has
prints of two superb color motion pic-
tures about Dinosaur National Monu-
ment, taken by Charles Eggert, which
may be rented by members and inter-
ested groups. This Is Dinosaur is a
spectacular scenic presentation of the
beauty of the great canyons, with dra-
matic sequences of mounted dinosaurs,
and of a boat trip down the rivers. It
rents for ten dollars a showing. Wilder-
ness River Trail is a record of the now-
famous expeditions led by the Sierra
Club to enable visitors to eXplore the
rivers. The tranquillity of the streams,
and the delight of camping there, is con-
trasted with the exhilaration of running
the rapids; the film closes with scenes
of what changes may be anticipated
should Echo Park Dam be built. This
can be rented for five dollars a show-
ing. Both films, for 16mm. sound pro-
jector, run a little less than half an

hour. Shipping costs one way are paid
by the Association.

Swimming Pools

The significant boom in municipal
outdoor swimming pool building in this
country (see Editorially Speaking, Oc-
tober 1954 RECREATION) has stimulated
a special series of articles for RECREA-
TION on their planning and construc-
tion. The first article appears in this
issue, on page 24.

Some few among many facts and fig-
ures about new construction, culled
from recent reports:

Alabama. The new municipal pool in

Selma, population 22,840, cost $106,-
000.

California. The city planning commis-
sion in Corona, population 10,223, has
plans for a new park and swimming
pool. . . . In La Junta, p0pulation 7,712,
the citizens recently approved, by an
advisory vote of 637 to 348, the city
building and maintaining a pool. . . .
Oakland’s fifth bond-issue swimming
pool and bathhouse, including bleachers
to accommodate six hundred, will in-
corporate the most modern features and
design. . . . In Los Angeles County a
$14,000 floating fishing dock and a
$262,000 swimming pool are planned
for Puddingstone Dam in the recreation
area of San Dimas, to he built by county
funds. . . . The San Francisco Recrea-
tion and Park Commission, with a bud-
get of $4,939,817 for 1954-55, has ap-
proved plans for an elaborate recreation
facility, Garfield Square, which will in-
clude a swimming pool; and Paul Op-
permann, city planning director, plans
and hopes for fifteen new swimming
pools for the near future.

Florida. Miami Beach has included a
municipal swimming pool in this year’s

budget.
Iowa. Dubuque passed a $225,000 bond

issue for a new swimming pool.

Michigan. In addition to its four out-
door, three indoor-outdoor, and thirty-
seven school pools now in operation.
Detroit is completing four others. All
pools measure 42 by 75 feet and have
adjoining sundecks. . . . In Dearborn,
within the next few years, there will be
an outdoor swimming pool in each ma-
jor section of the city’s twenty-five
square miles. When the network is com-
plete there will be one within walking
distance of every home. A two-year pro-
gram, already started, calls for eight
such pools.

Ohio. Cleveland has ten new ultra-
modern swimming pools costing ap-
proximately $1,000,000. Located'in an
area of 35,000 people within a three-
quarter-mile distance, they are called
“walk-to” pools because they can be
reached in a matter of few minutes. . . .
Norwalk also boasts a new outdoor pool,

60 by 120 feet, costing $73,000.

Oregon. A wedge-shaped pool accom-
modating 550 persons is the latest acqui-
sition of Klamuth Falls, population 15,-
875. It has underwater and overhead

lighting.

Vermont. The Parks and Recreation
Commission in Springfield, population

4,940, completed its $100,000 Spring-
field Memorial Pool.

Washington. Citizens of Bremerton,
population 27,678, opened their new

RECREATION

 

pool last August. In Evergreen Park,
the ovoid pool measures 90 by 60 feet
and can accommodate 300. . . . Seattle
has a new all-year indoor swimming
pool on the east side of Green Lake
Fieldhouse. Underwater lights are re-
cessed along the edge of the pool. . . .
Part of Tacoma’s $500,000 improve-
ment program will be a salt-water swim-
ming pool at Titlow Beach Park to be
ready next summer. This is one of the
last projects under a special millage

voted in 1952.

“Comic” Books

“Concern about so-called ‘comic’
books, and action to try to protect
young people from the horror and crime
‘comics’ are not new, although there has
in recent months been a growing appre-
hension over them. Experts are saying
that more youngsters are becoming in-
volved in crimes of violence. They be-
lieve that many of these violent, destruc-
tive and vicious acts are in part directly
traceable to stories or suggestions they
have read in the so-called ‘comics.’

TV. Watch for the standards on comic
books this committee is working out.
These have been promised for an early
issue of the National Congress bulletin.

“Have you actually read even one
‘bad’ comic book through from cover to
cover and picture by picture? Or are
you taking someone else’s word that
many comic books are awful beyond de-
scription? We recommend that you
take the time to gain firsthand informa-
tion for yourself. Do you know what
kinds of comic books the young people
in your community can find and buy on
the counters and shelves of your local
newsstands and stores?”—Clara Peter-

nile Protection, in Parents Magazine,

September 1954.

MUSIC

COMES TO

MAIN STREET

ODAY a joyous sound is rising
Tfrom every Main Street as millions

of young and old, once content
merely to listen to canned music, are
now making music themselves. Playing
a musical instrument, they have dis-
covered, is a hobby that can be a satis-
fying outlet for the universal desire to
be creative and a relaxing antidote to
the tension of our era.

One reason for this astonishing trend
is that new teaching methods make
learning to play a oy instead of drudg-
ery. No longer are lessons a boring
series of mechanical exercises whose
chief aim is to produce a polished tech-
nique. Enjoyment is now the goal, and
technique is regarded as unimportant.
After all, the average amateur wants to
play fairly simple classical or popular
tunes for his own pleasure, not for a
critical concert audience.

Here’s an example of the new method
at work: A year ago a young composer
and music teacher in New York' City
put an ad in the newspapers offering
to teach how to play the piano by ear.
He was amazed at the response. Re-
cently I asked if I might visit his studio
in Carnegie Hall and see how he con-
ducted the first lesson of a new pupil.

The new pupil was Edward Jones, a
travel agent about forty years old, who
had never taken music lessons but who
had a good ear and knew the melodies
of a number of popular songs. The
teacher, Morton S. Citron, mentioned
four songs and asked Jones which one
he’d like to begin with. Jones selected

“Blue Moon” and, after being shown
the key of C, managed to play the
melody with one finger of his right
hand.

Citron then showed him four simple

chords: C major, A minor, D minor,

and G major. Jones repeated them

several times until he was sure of them.
Citron next showed him how to combine
the melody and the chords, playing the
tune with the right hand and the chords
with the left. Jones now tried it-——and
to his surprise heard himself play the
first four bars of “Blue Moon.” I
looked at the clock; the travel agent
had been a pupil for twelve minutes.

By the end of the half-hour lesson he
could play eight bars, and had also tried
a few additional chord patterns. When
he left he was an excited and happy
man. At the second lesson, after twenty-
three minutes, he could play the entire
song.

Not all of Citron’s papils catch on as
quickly as Jones, who has an excellent
ear for music, but after a few lessons
they can play simple popular songs. “If

a person can hum or whistle a tune I
can teach him to play it on the piano,”
Citron told me.

Among his adult pupils are an as-
sistant manager of a hotel, a nurse, a
typesetter, and several doctors. One of
the doctors is head surgeon of a large
hospital. “The strain of operating is
magically relieved when I get home and
sit down at the piano,” he told Citron.
“Making music is a tonic and a perfect
therapy.”

Learning to play other instruments
has similarly been simplified and trans-
formed from a chore into a delight. As
a result, the sale of musical instruments
has boomed from some $87,000,000
worth in) 1939 to about $325,000,000
worth last year. Since Arthur Godfrey
began popularizing the ukulele, sales
have risen from 60,000 to 1,000,000 a
year. Before the war 180,000 guitars
were sold in a good year; in 1953 ad-
mirers of Les Paul bought 300,000.

The instruments now most in demand
are pianos, guitars, accordions, ukule-

les, and electronic organs. One reason

 

 

for the outstandingzpopularity of the
piano is that makei’é have designed
small ones that take up little space iii
modern small rooms; for example, a
spinet that is onlyl'iifty-seveli inches
wide.

The new chord organ can be played
with only two fingers. A finger of the
right hand plays the melody and a
finger of the left pushes the prOper
chord button for each tone of the
melody. No knowledge of musical no-
tation is needed—just memorize" the
various chord buttons.

The piano course is a favorite of the
nine educational courses which the Uni-
versity of Houston, Texas, offers on
its non-commercial TV station, KUHT.
Music of all types is taught: opera melo-
dies, easy themes from symphonies, folk
songs, cowboy songs, current popular
hits. Pupils of all ages are enrolled, in-
cluding an eighty-five-year-old man.
After the first six weeks of this eighteen—
week course pupils without previous in-
struction can play about thirty pieces.

Industries are giving music increas-
ing prominence in their recreation pro-
grams. On a recent trip to Chicago I at-
tended a class conducted by Jean Clin-
ton, who teaches a piano course created
two years ago by the local branch of
Western Electric Company as part of an
adult education program for employees.
An employee pays twelve dollars for ten
lessons and the firm pays the rest of
the cost. '

A man in the class began to play “Old
Black Joe.” His face was strained as be
searched out the notes with thick, un-
trained fingers. As he hit a wrong note
he turned to me and said, “Five weeks
ago I didn’t know the difference be-

tween a door key and the key of C.”
When he finished he looked up

pride themselves on the organized musi-
cal activities of their people. The Dow
Chemical Company in Midland, Michi-
gan, has a string quartet, a symphony
orchestra, choruses and various other
groups, in which all employees are in-
vited to participate. The groups’ concert
season includes thirty concerts, operet-
tas, oratorios and a spring festival, all
drawing big audiences.

In Peoria, Illinois, the Pabst Brewing
Company’s four-year-old musical pro-
gram has resulted in a men’s glee club,
a mixed chorus, and lessons on several
instruments. Two concerts are given
each year for employees and their fam-
ilies as part of this program.

In 1920 there were less than one hun-
dred symphony orchestras in this coun-
try; now there are about one thousand,
only a tenth of which are professional.
Some two hundred are college groups
and seven hundred are community or-
chestras composed of citizens who gath-
er together for the sheer pleasure of
making music. A third of the seven
hundred are in cities of 50,000 popula—
tion or less; one is in Clarksville, Ar-
kansas, whose population is 4,343.

The symphony orchestra of Kearney,
Nebraska, recruits its sixty players from
eight towns in the central part of the
state, and some members make hun-
dred-mile trips to attend weekly rehears-
als. There is an “Over-Sixty Symphony”
group in New York City whose only re-
striction is that all members be sixty
or older, and a “Youth Symphony” in
Seattle whose eighty members are high
school and college youngsters.

In 1947 a few amateurs in Mobile,
Alabama, formed a small chamber or-
chestra; today they have a full-size sym-
phony and a paid conductor. Members

include housewives, doctors, salesmen,
lawyers, engineers, and ten music teach-
ers from local schools. Two members
are mothers with four children each.
The group sets aside a fifty-dollar fund
for baby-sitters in its five thousand dol-
lar a year budget, and the mothers rare-
ly miss a rehearsal.

A new branch of the do-it-yourself
movement is “little” opera—a type sim-
pler than grand opera. Only a handful
of little Opera workshops existed a dec-
ade ago; now there are three hundred.
They have wonderful names: Grass
Roots Opera, Lemonade Opera, Penin-
sula Players. Some combine efforts with
the local community orchestra but most
of them have only a piano for accom-
paniment. They use barns, school audi-
toriums—any space they can get. There
is opera on the beach at Kennebunk,
Maine, on a roof in Los Angeles, and
in a cellar in New York City. I

Opera offers a perfect opportunity for
community effort. Costumes must be
sewed, wigs made, scenery designed and
built. Others who don’t sing or play an
instrument serve on committees that sell
tickets, address envelopes, and prepare
publicity. All have fun in joining hands

in an inspiring cultural adventure.

The Grass Roots Opera of Raleigh,
North Carolina, is headed by an elderly
lawyer who has taken it to about one
hundred and twenty-five towns and vil-
lages of the state. On its posters and
programs is a slogan that might well be
the motto of all who are making music
in America’s Main Streets, and are hav-

ing a whale of a time doing it;

“ We couldffollow no precedents, for
there are none; we had to blaze a new
trail.”

ARE WU

I THIS
WINTER

W. E. Powers

Each year our northland is covered
with a snowy cloak which attracts over
three million families to the wintry
slopes to enjoy the sport of skiing. The
first mantle of snow transforms this
mass of ski addicts into uncompro-
mising, resolute individuals who head
for the nearest ski resort where their
contagious enthusiasm is rewarded with
soaring runs down the broad white
slopes. Yet, there is at least an equal
number of potential skiers who forego
the pleasures of the ski slope, choosing
instead a winter of hibernation indoors.

Many married and single folks pro-
fess an interest in skiing, yet shy away
from it because they have heard that
appreciable expense, danger or time is
involved. Each year these rumors lead
many to a winter of inactivity instead
of snowy months outdoors enjoying one
of the cleanest, healthiest, and most ex-
hilarating of all sports.

Money is, of course, a prime consid-
eration, but a little originality will usu-
ally solve this problem without sacrific-
ing the fun involved. For instance, a
group of office workers in Boston were
plagued by limited finances. Acting on
the premise that only tow charges are
tolerable, they decided to beat the extra
expenses a weekend skier must endure:
meals, lodging, and transportation.

The group, which numbered over
twenty, first mapped out a sector which
included three or four major ski areas

and then conducted a concentrated sur-
vey of the available real estate in that
region. They soon found an old, par-
tially furnished, eight-room house
which had little appeal as a permanent
rental but was ideal for a weekend of

sible. For another moderate fee a near-
by neighbor fired the furnace so that a
warm house greeted the skiers on Friday
evenings. A transportation pool was
formed to assure use of a minimum
number of cars to get the twenty-odd
skiers “up country,” and a shuttle serv-
ice allowed them to ski at the resort of
their choice. The initial investment in
this venture, split up among the parti-
cipating group, was less than twenty
dollars per person and permitted all the
members to enjoy an unrestricted sea-
son of weekend skiing.

While most of the people involved
in this plan were single, it can work
equally well for married groups, especi-
ally where the children are grown up.
It’s usually difficult for married couples
with young children to get away for
even a single day’s skiing—if grand-
mother isn’t handy to alleviate the cost
of baby-sitting. Many resorts are now
setting up nursery schools so mom and
dad can get out on the slopes while the
kids have a time playing in the snow.

skiing. Introduce your child to skiing
at an early age on a pair of ski-skates
or a pair of the red-tipped, toy-store
variety skis. You’ll be many times re-
warded as you see their inherent abili-
ties blossom into skill and the develop-
ment of courage, alertness, comrade-
ship, and sportsmanship.

There are many other possibilities for
“can’t find
time to go skiing anymore.” If every-
thing else fails you might consider go-
ing separately on alternate weekends;

ing couples, the men doing some fast
and fanciful skiing on Saturday, the

One way to solve the problem of get-

part of your vacation schedule to the.
winter. It’s an opportunity to break up
that long fifty-week interim between
rest periods. A week at the shore dur-
ing the summer and a week at a moun-
tain lodge during the winter will add
a new twist and zest to your vacation
time. And, for economy, why not take
advantage of the special all-expense ski
weeks offered by the resorts which in-
clude meals, lodging, ski instructions,
and lift tickets at nominal prices?

A winter lodge is a great asset and
winter vacations.
However, most confirmed skiers and

encouragement to

skiing families only dream of such as
a luxury, placing it out of the realm of
possibility. If you have aspired to own-
ing a ski cabin but have been stopped
by the price of the land, there is one -

RECREATION

 

golden opportunity which should not be
overlooked. The government leases
many small tracts, principally in the
West or Northwest, on which rustic-
type cabins may be constructed. If
you’re lucky you might manage to ac-
quire a tract around such famous ski
areas as Aspen, Colorado, Sun Valley,
Idaho, or in skiing sections of Washing-
ton, Nevada, California, or Oregon.
There are other possibilities elsewhere
about which the Department of the In—
terior, Washington, D. C., will be happy
to supply information.

Costs

Skiing is not expensive. Your initial
investment is really a subscription to
pleasure. Moderately priced skis, poles,
boots, and bindings will give countless
afternoons of fun. For good quality" in
these items you may expect to pay twen-
ty dollars for skis, six dollars for bind-
ings, four dollars for poles, and another
twenty dollars for boots. With care
they’ll last ten years; that’s only five
dollars a year for all the skiing you can
pack into a season. '

Ski clothes need not be stylish, latest
model creations. There are many wind-
proof, water-repellent clothes on the

market at reasonable prices which will
serve for everyday wear.

The lodging expenses, if you choose
to go for a weekend, can be shared by
accepting bunkroom accommodations,

with meals, at about $3.50 to $5.50.

The beginner skier should not over-
look the advantages to be realized by
joining a local ski club. Dues may run
from three to five dollars, but the return
on your money is significant. For ex-
ample, most clubs have certified ski in-
structors who give you free lessons al-
most every weekend on the club slope.
Their equivalent at a resort is worth at
least two dollars per lesson. You’ll find
that day or weekend trips are all planned
for you in advance. You benefit from
the special group lodging and tow rates
which can be arranged for, as well as
transportation privileges extended by
other members who own cars, and they
usually expect only a reasonable con-
tribution for gasoline. Many clubs have
ski lodges and slopes which you can use
at no cost. There are many film shorts
on skiing which are made available to
skiing clubs, and you can enjoy these

JANUARY 1955

at club meetings when thefe is no snow.

Safety

There. is a common fallacy that ski-
ing is only for the young and healthy,
that once you’ve passed thirty “you’ve
had it,” so to speak; but the truth is
that the insurance mortality rate is the
same for skier and non-skier alike. Your

bones aren’t really that brittle nor your -

limbs that stiff. If you feel that they
are, then try herringboning spread-
eagled fashion up a lepe. There is no
better conditioner for aging limbs.

The dangers of skiing are, like those
of flying, vastly exaggerated. Your
safety is assured if you obey a few sim-
ple rules and employ a little common
sense. You’ll find that there is a speed
beyond which you feel unnaturally wob-
bly and off-balance when you attempt
to turn. Learn it, and stay below it, or
a trip down the 510pe on a toboggan will
be your fate. The same rule applies to
steepness. Don’t tackle slopes, and es-
pecially trails, beyond your ability. An-
other foremost consideration is your
physical condition. When the sun starts
to dip and you’re rushing downslope
so you can squeeze in another run be-
fore the lift shuts down, remember your
legs are tired, it’s harder to see the
ruts, and that last run will be icier.

It has been estimated, in a study, that
approximately one-third of all skiing
accidents can be attributed to skiers at-
tempting feats beyond their ability. Al-
most another third are due to inability
or poor udgment exercised when faced
with icy conditions, sticky snow, im-
pending collision, or poor visibility. In
other words, over half of the skiing ac-
cidents recorded could probably have
been avoided at the skier’s option. So,
if you follow the simple safety rules,
your chances of avoiding an accident
are at least twice as good as those of the
more reckless skier on the slope.

Remember that most of the action of
skiing centers about the legs. It’s es-
sential that you provide good support
for your ankles. This means good boots.
If you really fear that wrenched knee
or ankle then invest in a pair of safety
bindings which let go of the boot in a
spectacular fall. Invest your money in
good equipment rather than tailored ski
clothes.

Anybody, at any age. can have fun
on skis. If you have any doubt about
this matter, visit one of the larger re-
sorts some snowy weekend and watch
toddling tots come bouncing down the
slope, teen-agers whiz recklessly by,
middle-aged folks glide through effort-
less looping turns, oldsters (and we
mean those who have seen seventy
years) performing their cautious turns.

The skiing family should not over-
look the possibilities in suburban ski-
ing or backyard skiing, meaning the
small rope tows or local hills where leg
power takes over. The r0pe tows allow
a lot of skiing in one afternoon because
they can handle a large capacity even
on a busy weekend. The economy-
.minded family, after a dollar-saving
Sunday dinner at home, will drive prob-
ably less than twenty miles to a rope-
tow-serviced slope and, for a reasonable
charge, enjoy a solid afternoon of ski-
ing for not a great deal more than a
movie would cost.

Timing

You’ll be wise if'you can manage
most of your skiing during weekdays.
Pick spots not too accessible by snow-
trains or snow-buses. You’ll also get
more skiing for your money if you take
advantage of a good snowfall in your
own community. Reserve your trips for
the time when local conditions are poor
and the resort you plan to visit has the
maximum snow cover.

The wise skier will check the snow
reports published regularly in the news-
papers or the late reports given on ra-
dio broadcasts so he may realize the
most value for his dollar. It will also
pay to check reported conditions against
those you actually find at the resorts
you visit so as to gauge their reliability.

The answer to the question, “What’s
the fun in skiing?” cannot be obtained
by assuming the role of spectator. Ini-
tial self-consciousness regarding skill
and technique will give way to a fierce
pride at each new accomplishment. You,
as a skier, will dwell in a snowy para-
dise of breathless beauty, travel feath-
ery-white trails, and experience the un-
inhibited freedom of the skier. Then at
the close of day, gathered around the
open fire in the company of fellow ski-

ers, you will realize the fun and satis-
faction that skiing can bring you.

Robert L. Horney

 

Highlights of seven different talks by Mr. Horney
on community recreation, presented at state region-
al park and recreation meetings under the sponsor-
ship of the Illinois Association of Park Districts.

 

It is difficult to define recreation be-
cause it has a different meaning to the
individual at different stages of his life.
It would be safe to say that each of us
needs a change or «release from routine.
The things we do when we are free to
do what we will may be classified as
recreation or relaxation.

It is interesting to know what people
do with their free time, but even more
important to know what selections they
make when there is a freedom of choice.
If a quality and quantity of activities
is not offered to help stimulate the wise
choice of free time, we cannot justifi-
ably criticize people who make unwise
choices.

Although planned community rec-
reation is winning the support of parti-
cipants, civic leaders, and parents in
community after community, there still
is imu$cient understanding of its limit-
less benefits. In many instances this is
the fault of recreation leaders who have
built a narrow little program around
the known athletic interests of the male
population, offering a few activities for
men and boys only.

As important as these activities are,
such a program limits the expenditure
of the recreation tax dollar to only 3

thers” who feel that the recreation
budget should be spent only for chil-
dren. We agree that children should be
on the priority list, but other age groups
in the community must not be over-
looked. A purposeful and diversified to-
tal community recreation service should
be the goal. Unless members of park
and recreation boards, their employees,
and the taxpayer understand more fully
the philosophy, purpose, and values of
an inclusive community recreation serv-
ice, the citizens will receive only partial
benefits for the tax dollars appropriated
for recreation.

Some of the stock phrases we hear
voiced by the laymen are: “Recreation
keeps children off the streets”; “Rec-
reation is a fun-program”; “Recreation

community recrea-
tion program, serv-
ing both sexes, fam-
ilies, and all age
groups —providing
ample opportunity
to lcarn many skills
—should be goal.

 

cures delinquency”; “Recreation Keeps
’em busy.”

These are only half-truths. If the
present and future competition for the
tax dollar goes toward a recreation pro-
gram, that program must provide for
the basic needs of the citizens through
opportunities in creative expression, fel-
lowship, adventure, outdoor recreation,
relaxation, and service to our fellow
man. Equal opportunities for both sex-
es and family recreation offered on a
year-round basis are only two of the
aims of a desirable program. A wide
variety of program content for all age
groups with ample opportunity to learn
skills will help to attract and hold parti-
cipants to activity centers.

If the recreation budget is insufficient

,a

RECREATION

to meet the mounting requests for serv-
ices, the citizens should be encouraged
to accept part of the planning responsi-
bilities, and to interpret and support
drives for additional funds. Often citi-
zens can be stimulated to provide their
own recreation opportunities in their
backyards and home recreation rooms,
through guidance from the recreation
staff. Resourceful recreation directors
are inviting civic clubs, fraternal or-
ganizations, and neighborhood parents’
groups to underwrite and co-sponsor ac—
tivities that will add quantity and qual-
ity to the program, and thus make it
possible to include many more partici-
pants in the total community program.

A publication of the National Recrea-
ation Association has defined recrea-
tion simply as “a leisure time activity
engaged in for its own sake.” The ac-
tivity may take the form of indoor and
outdoor games and sports, hiking, pic-
nics, dancing, drama, singing, playing
instruments, arts and crafts, or clubs
and discussion groups. If we can ac-
cept the fact that what a person does
under conditions of free choice may al-
so affect his character, isn’t it highly
important to provide the experiences
that are wholesome and good for him?

An individual may be attracted to an
organized recreation activity for one or
more reasons. It may be only through
curiosity. He may be influenced be-
cause his friends are interested. He
may like the person in charge, or the
way the facilities are maintained.

Since he attends of his own volition,"

it behooves the leader to encourage him
to sample one or more activities. Often
the leader’s example will set the charac-
ter pattern for the participants, whether
attendance is casual or regular. Win-
ning with modesty, losing without bit-
terness, participating with courage, and
respecting the rights and privileges of
others are the values a person may learn
from sharing in group activities. Good
character habits are learned under the

wholesome guidance of qualified lead-
ers of community recreation.

Of equal importance is the learning
of skills which will develop hobbies and
life-long interests. During the learning
process participants discover new

friends and associates interested in the

same activity. This social aspect often

JANUARY 1955

is of as much value as the hobby itself.

It is highly important for the com-
munity recreation program to reach
children, teen-agers, adults, and the
elderly people of the community, for
each age division experiences loneli-
ness, insecurity, and an adjustment to
new conditions. Unless a person can feel
comfortable, useful, and accepted by
his fellow men, at least within his own
age level, there follows a shrinking,
rather than an outgoingness, that may
take him out of his rightful group. It is
through hobbies and special interests
during his leisure time that he is given
a sense of belonging and a degree of
personal satisfaction and recognition
that cannot be duplicated in spectator
activities.

Organized recreation programs of-
fered in the neighborhoods of the cities
and towns throughout the country will
aid with the control of delinquent acts
of various age groups. We need have
little concern about an individual when
he is eating or sleeping or working. It
is free time that weighs heavily on idle
minds. Although recreation is not pre-
scribed as a a"cure-all,” it can be de-
pended upon as a good antidote. Reli-
able testimonials from court judges,
police officers and probation authorities
support the fact that when young peo-
ple have playgrounds and indoor rec-
reation centers to rely on for their free
time, delinquent problems are few.

Delinquency and vandalism know no
boundaries and may break out in any
neighborhood, rich or poor. It has been
said that every child without guidance
is a potential delinquent. It follows that
all welfare agencies, churches, schools.
parks and recreation agencies and par-
ent groups should join hands to offer
the type of community recreation pro-
gram which Will challenge the interest
and participation of all young people.
This requires cooperative planning, am-
ple financing, and adequate facilities
not more than a half-mile distance from
each home in the community.

Recreation contributes generally to
good citizenship. It involves the capa-
city for and a willing attitude toward
cooperative effort. It offers the experi-
ence of group work and team work.
These experiences learned early by
young people lay the groundwork for
cooperative adult citizenship.

The “How” of Program

It would be quite impossible to pre-
pare a “blueprint” on starting a recrea-
tion program applicable to every com-
munity. However some basic principles
can be followed. While the needs of the
various age groups are much the same
in every community, the techniques and
procedures for stimulating an awaken-
ing of the citizens to the needs may vary
somewhat. Many communities fail with
their attempt to establish a community
recreation program because of lack of
professional guidance.

A short cut to successful community
organization is available to communi-
ties who request the services of the Na-
tional Recreation Association field rep-
resentative who will guide the initial
planning, make recommendations, and
assist the local citizen’s group in get-
ting a community recreation program
started.

The following ideas and suggestions
have been used successfully in a number
of communities:

A citizen’s group composed of repre-
sentatives from all the organized groups
of a given community could be formed
to study the needs, finance a study or
survey by 'an eXperienced planner to
obtain the facts to support the contem-
plated drive for an organized depart-
ment of parks and recreation. When
findings are available, an approach is
outlined. The combined efforts of the
citizen’s group will be necessary to in-
terpret the needs to all citizens.

This citizen’s group will also need to
be responsible for raising funds to fi-
nance either a demonstration program,
pass a referendum tax to give perma-
nency to the. year-round program, or
solicit funds to finance a seasonal pro-
gram to meet temporary needs. What'-
ever method is selected, it will require
professional guidance to minimize the
responsibilities of the citizen’s group
and to obtain the results desired.

If plans are made for a referendum
tax, it is important to let the citizens
know how much additional tax will be
added on an annual basis; What will be
offered in the way of a‘program; and
how the funds will be administered.
These three points are extremely im-
portant and should be presented at the
start of the educational campaign for

17

support of the recreation tax.

Other methods used to raise funds
for part-time or seasonal program in-
clude benefits, voluntary donations, and
solicitations. There are eXamples, too,
of programs being started with volun-
teers and later taken over by the city,
the school board, or the park board. In
most cases, however, a tax referendum
campaign was conducted to authorize
a tax-supported body to collect an an-
nual tax and supervise the conduct of
the recreation program services.

There are many factors that affect
the planning, conduct, and supervision
of a given community recreation pro-
gram. Population, industrial, residen-
tial, and racial groups, available facili-
ties, adequate finances, availability of
qualified leadership are" some of the
most important factors. It often follows
that the larger the city the more the fac-
tors that must be taken into considera-
tion by a legal or advisory board.

Regardless of the size of the com-
munity the minimum program of acti-
vities should include all age groups. A
program for all is the only justification
for spending tax funds. Unless the rec-
reation board and the director are fa-
miliar with the basic needs of age
groups the program will fall short in
its effectiveness. The age group classi-
fications to be considered are: children
from four to eight years; eight- to fif-
teen-year-olds; teen-agers; adults and
citizens over sixty-five years of age. Al-
though details cannot be provided here,
suggestions for desired activities for
communities according to their differ-
ent sized budgets, may be obtained free
of charge by sending request and a
stamped self-addressed enve10pe to REC-
REATION magazine.

We should not overlook the great
wealth of volunteer leadership that is
to be found in almost every communi-
ty.“ The job of the director and his
board is to discover this potential lead-
ership and to encourage these people
to lend their skills to the enrichment of
the community program. The secret of
using volunteer leadership successfully
is not to overload the work schedule of
the volunteer, yet to give him the recog-
nition that is his due. Volunteers may
be found in every walk of life, parents,

skilled laborers, professional people,
and so on. One way to discover the peo-
ple with skills who may work into vol-
unteer leaders is to promote a city-wide

hobby show.

but do not overuse them.

Use volunteers wisely,

There is available a wide range of
cost figures for recreation program
services. Unless we understand the 10-
cal circumstances these figures are not
of much value. We can find evidence
in some cities where less than fifty cents
per capita is spent on recreation, yet
the community recreation department is
providing a well-balanced program of
activities. However, in most of these
situations, facilities are provided at a
minimum rental, maintenance is given
without cost, charges and fees help pay
the bills, and volunteer help is of the
best quality. By way of contrast there
are many communities spending the
same per capita cost where there is very
little to show for the expenditure.

The records show that some cities
spend as high as $3.00 per capita for
public recreation. Where the park and
recreation departments -are combined
the figure may reach $6.00 per capita.
This does not mean that cities with com-
bined departments of parks and recrea-
tion must spend $6.00 or more for a
recreation program. The reports do
show, nevertheless, that in cities where
the cost for recreation alone is over
$1.50 per capita and from $4.00 to
$6.00 where the parks and recreation
are combined, a good job is being done
in interpreting the program to the peo-
ple of the community.

The time will come when most cities
will spend as much as $5.00 to $8.00

per capita for recreation alone and from
$8.00 to $15.00 per capita for a com-
bined department of parks and recrea-
tion. However, park and recreation
services will need to be improved, and
this means better trained leadership to
plan, conduct, and sell the program to
the citizens. These predictions are not
pipe dreams. If taxpayers would add
up the costs they are now paying for
mental institutions, penal institutions,
crime, vandalism, and so on, they would
find these tax costs overwhelmingly
high. When communities are willing to
spend more for diversified public rec-
reation programs the tax ‘Costs for crime

and mental illness may be reduced.

Additional funds for the support of
the public recreation program may not
come from the taXpayer if he has not
been convinced that the increased costs
will be useful and important to him and
his family. "

The total cost of community recrea-
tion need not always be borne by the
recreation tax funds. The public school,
private agencies, fraternal and other
civic grOUps have a stake in the total
program for the city. In the long run
the total cost of the program may be
held to a minimum if cooperative plan-
ning can be deve10ped. An organization
with representatives from many groups
in the city, both public and private,
could be developed to coordinate their
efforts, monies, leadership and facilities
in working out a community recreation
program.

Cooperative planning reduces compe-
tition for participants, a duplication of
activities, and expenditures, with the re-
sult that the total costs may be held
down. Before much progress can be
made, community leaders involved must
be willing to be less concerned about
identities and to forget personality con-
flicts that have prevented previous coop-
erative planning.

There is no excuse for smugness on
the"part of boards and directors with
the programs they are offering. The
point to remember is that we should not
be satisfied just with the passage of a
tax referendum. We need to keep build-
ing and evaluating the program from
then on. This must go on throughout
the year if the confidence and support
of the citizens is to be won and held.
Evaluating the program also aids in
long-range planning and in finding out
the needs of the people which change
with times and conditions. The work of
the leaders and the lay board must also
come in for an evaluation. Only through
taking an unbiased look at what we are
doing, may we grow and expand our
services.

Surely there is a limit as to how far
you may go in planning for people.
There is no limit to growth if we plan
with people.

£“RECREATION

THE

THE“
RECREATIIIN
S’l‘llllY

It took” sixteen years to bring recreation to
this community. This story is designed
to help you do the same job—quicker.

Topekans believe the truth of the old saying about water
wearing away stone. They saw it happen—in the sixteen
years it took them to get a full-time recreation department
headed by a professional executive experienced in the rec-

reation field, R. Foster Blaisdell.

“It’s a familiar story to hundreds of communities who have
fought their way to‘a coordinated public recreation program
supported by tax money. But to many other cities and towns
not yet so fortunate, it may be a help to see how this com-
munity went about it.

Several basic principles emerged from this project: It
takes a great many dijferent kinds of people to put anything
across. It is dificult to get the general public stirred up over
recreation. People don’t see this need as they see the need
to give bread to the hungry. You need both husbands and
wives concerned and working on a project to insure success.

Topeka is the capital city of Kansas. For many years,
until World War II, its population was just under fifty thou-
sand. There was some industry, mostly the Santa Fe rail-
road shops and oflices. Hotel and convention facilities were
good. Playground and recreation facilities were not.

In 1937, the president of the Topeka Woman’s Club asked
Mrs. Benson Powell, wife of a Methodist minister, to be
chairman of the citizenship committee. Mrs. Powell, feeling
that such chairmanships should not be routine, looked about
for a job under that committee heading. With the trained
eye of a minister’s wife, she noticed that many Topekans
lived in crowded areas with far too many children for the
far too few yards or play areas.

Mrs. Powell had with her Mrs. Will Menninger and Mrs.
Aubrey McDonald as committee members.
thought was of the city’s schools. Why couldn’t Topeka do
as Milwaukee was said to be doing———light its school build-
ings at night, use them as centers for creative leisure for
these overcrowded families?

Several women’s organizations cooperated to get the WPA
to conduct a study of the city’s recreation facilities and
needs. They met with John Gronseth of the National Rec-
reation Association and worked out a detailed plan calling
for a law to provide tax support for a paid, professional
director. Here they met two big problems. Even though
several organizations had become involved, the number of
people actually close to the situation formed a drop in the
bucket. Not enough people had any real conception of prob-
lem or solution. And this was still depression'time. War-
time economy had not yet come into being—Kansas wheat
cr0ps had been few and cheap during the thirties—the state
did not have the diversified industry it has today.

The mayor discussed the project with the city commis-
sioners. They would not consider or favor anything calling
for increased taxes. A state senator told the committee
bluntly that a bill could be introduced in the legislature but
that it would never even get out of committee so long as the
local city'commissioners did not favor it. Various social
agencies began to worry. If the ladies succeeded, got their
tax levy through to support recreation, what would happen
to the annual fund drives of these agencies? The whole
idea seemed hopelessly bogged down.

World War II created a fresh interest in recreation prob-
lems, however, and broadened that interest through a wider
segment of Topeka. The National Recreation Association,
through Arthur Todd and others, kept putting in a word
when it could. -

In 1945, Coffeyville in southern Kansas helped to get an
enabling act through the legislature—this made it possible
for cities to conduct referenda and set up levies for recrea-
tion purposes. As several cities took advantage of the new
law, Topekans found themselves discussing their needs more
pointedly. Mr. C. S. Hettinger, chairman of the Council of
Social Agencies’ Recreation Committee, led in planning a
leadership training institute for Topeka in 1946 and NRA’S

Anne Livingston conducted it.
The terrible 1951 flood of the Kaw River did a good bit,

19

too—it welded a lot of folks closer together, forced some
community activity. More people became conscious of the
city’s lack of adequate leisure-time facilities.

0n the southwest side of Topeka, where the city was ex-
panding most rapidly, Dr. Henry Blake bought a home for
his family—and found he was an even mile from the nearest
playground. He and his wife found their neighbors con-
cerned, joined them in discussions which led to a neighbor-
hood fund-raising campaign, the donation of some land,
and a self-supported Westwood neighborhood playground.

Jim Reed, editor of the Topeka Capital, had moved into
another new area where there were few or no playground
facilities. Long sports-minded, Reed saw something needed
to be done if Topeka were to remain a good place in which
to raise a family. He employed Mrs. Victor Hawkins, wife
of a research director, to make a thorough study of existing
Topeka facilities. Meantime, through the National Recrea-
tion Association, and from editors in similar communities,
he found out how Topeka compared with others. The com-
parison was not good, especially since the city had grown
to almost twice its former size.

Barney Barnett enjoyed playing tennis in Topeka as a
boy, and he worked with a group to provide tennis courts
and maintain them. This made for another recreation-con-
scious group to help the chain reaction along.

These persons are, of course, only a handful of the many
who had a share in bringing organized recreation to Topeka.
The Chamber of Commerce sports and recreation committee
was giving attention to the problem. The enlarged and now
extremely active recreation committee of the Council of
Social Agencies was holding frequent sessions.

Among other developments over the years had been a bul-
letin on available recreation facilities, developed by the
council and printed by the Kiwanis Club. A youth center
program had been started at the end of the war; a “senior
citizens” project was under way.

The -next step was formation of an executive committee
for a recreation referendum. This committee had to be
apart from the Council of Social Agencies in order to take
in every facet of the community and still have the council’s
background of experience, its facilities for getting jobs done,
keeping records, and so on. It was vital that this committee
have a clearly defined objective; otherwise it would bog
down in a morass of mixed goals.

Seven articles in the daily Capital helped spark public
interest and clarify the objective. It is often possible for
a number of large committees to be functioning at full speed
,while thousands of people do not know the committees even

exist, unless the town’s newspaper really takes hold. The
titles of these articles [see illustration] tell the story.

The executive committee, with representatives from a
wide variety of local businesses and organizations, showed
the breadth and depth this project had finally achieved.
Mayor Kenneth Wilke and Board of Education President
M. C. Oberhelman expressed willingness to cooperate with
the- Committee and to follow whatever mandate the voters
issued.

By 1952 fifteen years of work were behind the project;
it had what it needed for success: an awakened community;

20

a careful, intelligent planning group; a definite goal; and
lots of energetic salesmanship. Barney Barnett expressed
it well in words of advice to any community anywhere: “If
you can find some way to correlate the efforts of the many
.people interested—then never give up—you’re in.” The
Council of Social Agencies and its patient director, Romana
Hood, had provided the correlating machinery.

The executive committee then organized itself for the last
big push on this pattern:

An estimated budget was set up, door-to-door visitations
made on merchants by merchants to raise the money for a
recreation referendum campaign. The sum agreed upon
was $850. A big general public meeting was an initial
major step. Out of town speakers told of the need, the gains
it would bring, and why everyone should back such a pro-
gram. The promotion and publicity committee prepared
five thousand leaflets and other printed {materials Arrange-
ments were made for a large billboard ad on a principal
boulevard, and for a plug on a bread wrapper. Another
series of articles, about recreation in other Kansas towns,
began to appear in the Topeka Capital.

Next came petitions for the election. These had to be in,
signed by five per cent of the registered voters, thirty days
before election day. Speeches were made before all service
clubs and PTA’s, and pamphlets were delivered to all of
them in gross. The Council of Social Agencies provided
valuable help again by having machinery to arrange speak-
ing dates before all community groups. Local women’s
groups were very active throughout the campaign.

Posters were put up just a week before election day.
Copies of the newspaper stories were put together in book-
let form and distributed. Special interest angles were.de-
veloped to help papers and radio stations. Local merchants
put promotion material on their regular radio advertising
spots. A special broadcast was planned and aired the day
before election; and full page ads ran in both newspapers.
0n election day, the committee worked hard and long. The
news came—every precinct carried .’ The totals were 23,506
for the propOsal, 10,247 against.

So now Topeka has its five member recreation commis-
sion. The city commission and school board accepted sug-
gestions made by the executive committee.

This brings us back to Mr. Blaisdell, the recreation di-
rector employed by the commission on January 4, 1954.
Of course, he feels that the job has just begun. He has
found scores of community agencies with some phase of rec-
reation; but there is much still to be done. Keep at it, Mr.
Blaisdell—water will wear away stone!

Some “Clippers” of the YWCA, Honolulu, in a fine team routine at Niagara Falls.

The newness of synchronized swim-
ming, a sport which boasts but six years
of recognition, still causes many per-
sons to ask, “What is it, and how does
it differ from water ballet?”

Actually, water ballet contributed
much to its development, but synchron-
ized swimming combines additional
skills and variations of strokes which
are adapted to musical accompaniment.
Its relation to regular swimming is the
same as that of “fancy skating” to regu-
lar skating, and in competition its judg-
ing is comparable to that of diving.

Synchronized swimming presents a
field which is open to the majority of

persons while the speed field is open to r

only a few. It creates and maintains
interest among all levels of swimmers,
as everyone can participate to one de-
gree or another.* Use of supported
floats in shallow water, floating devices,
and simple arm strokes can be used to
give a non-swimmer a place in the pro-
gram otherwise denied him.

In its earlier stages, synchronized

variations of standard strokes and a
combination of these phases. Thus syn-
chronized swimming was deve10ped. It
covers a wider range than ballet, or ust
keeping time to the music; it tells a
story as well.

The American Red Cross, in recog-
nizing the activity by including instruc-
tions for it in its aquatic schools, has
this to say, “The primary objective of
our water safety services is to make peo-
ple safe while in, on, or about the water.
This objective is realized by teaching
peOple how to swim and how to handle
small craft. However, it is Red Cross
thinking that the objective can be
reached more easily if we are able to
provide meaningful and enjoyable out—
lets for the skills learned in the swim-
ming and small craft classes. In casting
about for meaningful and enjoyable
outlets, we were impressed by the pos-
sibilities offered in the field of synchro-
nized swimming. Therefore, Red Cross
is prepared and is working with estab-
lished agencies with the express pur-
pose of developing leadership in this
field.”

Another agency that is recognizing
the activity is the YWCA which always

Synchronized
Swimming

A NEW SPORT

Myron N. Hendrick

has encouraged swimming programs,
but has frowned on representation in
competition. Now, in every community
where synchronized swimming has be-
gun to Hourish, the “Y” has been an im-
portant factor through classes, clinics,
exhibitions, and meets. This might very
well be because synchronized swimming
offers a real challenge to the interests of

any girl who likes to swim. Realizing

that the opportunity to attempt the
stunts is contingent upon her improve—
ment of basic strokes, the youngster
really applies herself in classwork.

Ballet dancing is an important ad-
j unct to the sport as the girls appreciate
the grace and poise it develOpS, and it
aids them materially in understanding
and interpreting movements in the wa-
ter. An understanding and appreciation
of music is kindled as the girls scan mu-
sic shops and libraries for material in
planning routines. It isn’t “be-bop” or
“jazz” that appeals; what they are seek-
ing is the type of music furnished by
Andre Kostelanetz, Dave Rose, Percy
Faith, the Boston “POps,” and the Lon-
don Philharmonic.

We are not attempting, here, to pre-
sent teaching methods or a complete
story on synchronized swimming tech-
niques, but rather to point out its grow—
ing interest and some of its values.
There are many experts in the field who
are willing to make their knowledge
available and a bibliography appears at
the conclusion of this article.

nadian-American synchronized swim-
ming meets—the second was last July
when our city, long known as a mecca
for tourists, really turned out to wel-
come the visiting swimmers. Jointly
sponsored by the recreation department
and the Kiwanis Club of North Niagara
Falls, with the cooperation of the
YWCA, Red Cross, Girl Scouts and oth-
er community groups, the event had
been in preparation for months and,
from the time the first visitors arrived
until the last had departed, every mo-
ment was planned for competition, clin-
ics, and entertainment. '

It was well that this planning had
been so thorough as over two hundred
competitors, students of the sport and
coaches, converged on Niagara Falls
from all corners of the land: from Cali-
fornia on the West, Texas and Florida
on the South; Maine and Quebec on the
East; and such mid-country states as
Missouri, Wisconsin, and Illinois. They
journeyed in by car, by train, and by
plane from Connecticut, New Jersey,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Mary-
land, New York and nearby Ontario.

Why all this enthusiasm, not only on
the part of the citizens of Niagara Falls,
but shown by the visitors as well?
The answer is simple. Niagara Falls
has had the opportunity to share in de-
veloping this new sports activity, and
has learned that its value in the field of
girls’ participation is unequalled.

22

Many recreation departments are still
being censured for offering girls noth-
ing but “rehashed boys’ sports” in their
athletic programs; but there has been
no alternative.

However, as synchronized swimming
is taking its place on the sports scene,
it opens to girls a new field of enjoy-
ment through participation in program
activity.

The first interest in this sport in Ni-
agra Falls was generated by the appear-
ance in an exhibition back in 1950 of
June Taylor, the national indoor cham-
pion, and of the Ornamental Swim-
ming Club of Peterborough, Ontario,
later national U. S. champions.

Sensing the possibilities of the sport
as a new girls’ activity, the community
recreation officials formed a committee
to seek additional information. Further
clinics and exhibitions were held, which
stimulated additional interest; and clas-
ses were started by the YWCA and the
recreation department.

This search for knowledge brought
to light the fact that many other com-
munities were also groping for help.
The idea of a meet that would not only
offer official competition, but also would
include clinics and instruction periods,
was deemed the best means of dissemi-
nating this information. Securing the
wholehearted cooperation of Mrs. Nor-
ma Olson, of Oakland, California, the
national A. A. U. chairman, and Mrs.
Peg Seller of Montreal, president of the
Dominion of Canada association, a Ca-
nadian-American meet was initiated
with the Kiwanis Club of North Niagara
Falls as co-sponsors.

The meet was an immediate success

and, in ust two years, has become not
only the most outstanding event staged
annually in Niagara Falls, but has been
recognized by swimmers in both the
United States and Canada as an op-
portunity to further their knowledge
and interest in sport. It has taken rank
with the national championships of both
countries. Champions and novices both
have appeared in the Niagara Falls com-
petition with equal confidence, and na-
tional committee members have been on
hand to give words of advice to the as-
piring youngsters. .

Synchronized swimming competition
is divided into three classifications:
solo, duet, and team (four to twelve
members). All of the girls participating
prepare routines not to exceed six min-
utes, including a maximum limit of
thirty seconds deck work. These rou-
tines must include five required stunts,
one from each grouping listed in the
A. A. U. synchronized swimming hand-
book. Five judges, sitting in elevated
positions, determine the performances
-—taking into consideration such points

as construction of the routine, presenta-

...tion of strokes from the standpoint of

perfection, and the synchronization of
the swimmers, one with the other and
also with the music. In addition they
view the performance for manner of
presentation, costuming, and spectator

appeal.

honors in the 1954 Niagara Falls meet

twelve-girl team from Peterborough,
Ontario, performed an intricate pattern
in “The Devil Dance.” They were close-
ly followed by the four from the Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin, Aquatic Club with
their rhythmic “Mambo Tropicana.”

Duet competition was spirited with
Oakland’s Jackie Brown and Joanne
Berthelson adding to their honors with
“Aladdin’s Dream”; while the “Mercu-
ry Maids” presentation by Sandy Gilt-
ner and Judy Haga from‘ the Lansing,
Michigan, Sea Sprites was close behind
in the runner-up spot. The solo com-
petition resulted in a deadlock with J 0-
Anne Royer from Riverside, California,
and Sandy Giltner finishing all even.
Miss Royer performed a classic number
“Pygmalion’s Dream,” while Miss Gilt-
ner’s was a novel performance of “The
Sparkler.”

While the big meet has had value to
the visitors, the reaction of the towns-
people has been the greatest factor from

a recreation viewpoint. Without ex-

ception, the competitors were truly rep-
resentative of what we as parents hope
and look for in our youngsters. Whether
the girls were from Montreal or Quebec,
California or Maine, Michigan or New
Jersey, Wisconsin or Texas, they were
truly fine ambassadors of youth.

This little story hardly does justice to
synchronized swimming except to show
our enthusiasm, but we are willing to
share what we have. Anyone seeking
information about initiating a program

New Park Projects .

More and more communities are find-
ing new park and playground sites via
acquisition of tax-delinquent tracts. In
Minnesota the city council of Albert
Lea (population 13,545) recently de-
cided to purchase such a tract for de-
velopment as a park. Residents have
agreed to contribute playground equip-
ment. Another Minnesota municipality,
Brooklyn Center (population 4,284)
has acquired approximately one hun-
dred and thirty acres of forfeited land
for park purposes.

The donation of land for park pur-
poses by public-spirited citizens is also
becoming more and more prevalent. In
California, the town of Placentia (popu-
lation 1,682) recently received twelve
acres of land worth $50,000 and the

services of a landscape architect from

completed the dam will impound the

for the project were formed in 1935

Considerations in Planning

This is the first of a series of three
articles on planning and construction.
The second will appear next month.

The boom in the building of outdoor swimming pools of
all types has been one of the outstanding recreation phenom-
ena in the past few years and is based on the insistent de-
mand by the American people for more places in which to
swim. Colleges and universities, hotels, lodges, motels, clubs,
and industries are among the agencies providing pools for
restricted groups. Commercially-operated pools serve the
general public; and outdoor pools, chiefly at camps, as well
as indoor pools, have been built by voluntary agencies such
as the YMCA and Boys’ Clubs, primarily for the use of their
members. A large number of private home pools have been
built for family use; but the pools that have brought swim-
ming opportunities to the greatest number of people are
those constructed by recreation, park, and other public au-
thorities.

The extent to' which the movement for pools has grown is

illustrated by a recent study in the State of California}.

which disclosed a total of 417 pools open to the public or
to certain age levels for instruction and recreation and an
additional 51 such pools under construction or in the plan-
ning and drawing board stages. It estimated that there were
approximately 19,300 swimming pools in the state, of which
some 18,500 are private pools; yet it pointed out that “only
the 468 public pools can be counted on to provide opportu-
nity for the needs of most of the state’s rapidly expanding
population.” Hoffman-Harris, Incorporated, estimate that
the number of pools in America, exclusive of private estate
pools, increased from 8,200 to 13,300 during the six years
beginning January 1, 1948. A large percentage of all pools
in the country are outdoor pools.

The American public has come to realize that swimming is
a delightful form of recreation which can be enjoyed by peo—
ple of all ages; that it is also a challenging sport and one
that must be mastered before a person can safely engage in
boating, fishing, and other aquatic activities. Because it

contributes to health and physical fitness, swimming has won
a high place in school and college physical education pro-
grams, thus affording instruction for large numbers of
American youth. Ability to swim proved a means of wartime
survival for countless numbers of servicemen, who conse.
quently recognize the importance of teaching aquatic skills
to the younger generation. Since most American commu-
nities have few, if any, natural facilities for swimming, arti-
fieial pools must be constructed in order to meet this grow-
ing demand.

The chief purpose of this series is to offer advice and sug-
gestions to communities which lack adequate opportunities
for swimming and are contemplating the construction of one
or more pools. Opinions differ widely as to the relative
merits of different types and shapes of pools, design fea-
tures, water purification methods, and other factors. It is
important that a community should consider carefully the
various questions to be answered in planning and building a
pool and make its decisions in the light of the best available
information and experience. The articles outline several
procedures that are essential in developing a swimming pool
plan and point out other factors that have been treated at
length in technical literature which merits careful study.

Initiating a Pool Project

Most public outdoor swimming pools are built, controlled,
and operated by a recreation or park department or 801110
other municipal agency, although boards of education have
built such pools in several states. Occasionally, especially

RECREATION

in smaller communities, pools designed for community use
have been financed, constructed, and operated by a citizens’
committee or a local civic group. The procedure to be fol-
lowed in setting out to secure a pool naturally varies with
the local situation, but certain steps are generally advisable
in order to assure the success of the project. ‘

The individual or group that wants to secure a pool for
the community usually must enlist the cooperation of others
in determining what needs to be done and in developing a
plan to do it. A recreation or park board may conduct its
own investigation, but it often appoints a committee of in-
terested and competent citizens to help with the study. In a
community where no official group is ready to accept this
responsibility, such a study committee is essential. Partici-
pation by a group of citizens in a pool study helps assure
public support for the project. Whenever possible, a com-
mittee should include an experienced swimming instructor,
pool' Operator, construction engineer, architect, public health
official, physician, recreation executive, and an eXpert on
water purification equipment. Often, however, such per-
sons cannot be found in the locality and the committee must
seek the help of outside authorities.

The importance of seeking the most expert and all-inclu-
sive advice in the development of plans for a pool cannot be
overemphasized. The health and safety of the people using a
pool may be jeopardized, and activities limited, if mistakes
are made in design and construction. Individuals and com-
mittees interested in building a pool are therefore urged to
make a thorough study of the excellent literature available
which deals with various aspects of pool design and con-
struction, and to make sure that plans conform to commonly
approved practice.

In most states plans for any swimming pools to be Open
to the public must be approved by the state department of
health before the pool can be built; so, one of the first steps
is to secure from the state or local health authorities copies
of their regulations governing pool construction and opera-
tion. The names of competent, experienced pool architects
and engineers can generally be secured from this source. Be-
cause of the many problems peculiar to pools, it is highly
desirable that a person who has had successful experience
in pool design be consulted by the committee early in the
study and be employed to prepare the pool plans.

Before a final decision is reached as to type and size of
the pool, it is well for members of the committee to visit other
communities with"pools of types under consideration. Dur-
ing such visits an attempt should be made to secure as much
information as possible concerning various pool factors and
features and to learn what changes have proved advisable
on the basis of experience in the operation of the pools. In
making its study the pool committee needs to gather infor-
mation of several types, as follows (responsibility for vari-
ous parts of the job may be assigned to subcommittees) :

1. Existing facilities for swimming that are available for
use of the local population and that might influence the at-
tendance at a new pool, if built. a

2. Types of pool activities for which there is present or

potential demand and which should be considered in plan-
ning the pool.

ADMINISTRATION

3. Probable volume of use of pool based upon interest,
population trends, summer temperature, vacation habits and
swim consciousness of local p0pulation, use by neighboring
communities, and so on.

4. The size and type of pool that would best serve local
needs, as determined by the committee, and make possible
the desired activities at a minimum cost.

5. Availability of sites suitable in size, nature, and loca-
tion for a pool of the size and type proposed.

6. Estimated cost of constructing the proposed pool and
bathhouse and of purchasing the site, if necessary.

7. Estimated annual cost of operating the pool and the
probable income based on volume of use and types of serv-
ices for which a charge would be made.

8. Various legal aspects of the project such as the author-
ity of the municipality to finance and operate a pool or to
permit a community group to build and operate a p90] on
public property; also, the liability of the pool management
in case of accidents to persons using the pool. The possi-
bility of joint financing of the pool by public and school
funds should also be explored.

On the basis of the information gathered by the commit-
tee and of the advice from one or more pool consultants, a
plan of action needs to be worked out, if construction of
a pool appears desirable and feasible. Such a plan must
provide not only for the size, type, and location of the pool,
but for financing, managing, and maintaining it. A deci-
sion must be reached, for example, as to whether the public
is to be taxed for building the pool, which usually involves
a referendum authorizing a bond issue, or whether a cam-
paign for funds is to be conducted. If ta-x funds are to be
used, responsibility for building, operating, and maintain-
ing the pool is usually assigned to a recreation department,
park board, or other appropriate departments. If the pool
is to be built with contributed funds, a corporation may be
formed to carry out these functions, although in many locali-
ties responsibility for operating the pool is turned over to
the municipality and, eventually, title to the pool is trans-
ferred to the city.

Public support and approval are essential to the success
of every pool project. It is therefore highly important that
the pe0ple‘ be kept informed as to progress in the develop-
ment of pool plans. It is often desirable to include on the
pool study committee individuals selected from such groups
as the chamber of commerce, churches, civic groups, volun-
tary agencies, organized labor, industry, and the press.
Before a campaign in support of a pool proposal is launched,
there is value in arranging a public meeting to which all
local organizations are invited to send representatives and
at which tentative plans are explained, sketches of the pro-
posed pool are displayed, reasons for the project are pre-

’ sented, and suggestions are requested from the group. Prep-

aration and distribution of a printed or mimeographed
statement setting forth the values of a pool, describing the
proposal, and interpreting the cost are an essential feature
of a bond issue or fund campaigns? H

Factors Influencing Pool Design

Types of pool activities desired, location, size, and cost,
as previously mentioned, are among the factors influencing
pool design which require early consideration. Various
ways in which these factors affect pool plans are:

Desired Pool Activities. The outdoor swimming pool, like
every other recreation facility, has value only because it
serves specific functions and makes it possible for peeple
to engage in desired activities. The first decision in pool
planning is therefore to secure agreement as to the specific
activities for which it is to be built and their relative im-
portance. Most public pools are intended primarily to afford
opportunities for people of a wide range of ages to enjoy
bathing and general swimming. Unless designed primarily
for children, most pools are also constructed to accommo-
date people wishing to dive. Swimming instruction for chil-
dren, youth, and adults, is almost universally provided, and
its requirements are quite similar to those for general swim-
ming. Life saving, competitive swimming, survival aquat-
ics, synchronized swimming, water polo, water pageants,
and swimming for the physically handicapped are among
pool activities that are growing in popularity in many cities
that have more or less specific space or facility requirements.
A careful study of potential aquatic interests in the locality
may reveal a desire for activities that require modifications
in the proposed pool plan. It is seldom possible in a single
pool, especially with limited funds, to meet fully the desires
of all special interest groups, but an attempt should be made
to design a pool to serve many diversified uses.

Site Selection. The pool constructed on a site that is at-
tractive, easily accessible to the people it is intended to serve,
and adequate in size has a much greater chance of success
than one in a less favorable location. For this reason the
least expensive site may prove costly in the long run. Site
requirements vary somewhat with the type and size of pool
although every pool site should meet certain criteria. A
small pool designed to meet the day-by-day needs of the
people of a neighborhood should obviously be located as
near the center of the neighborhood as possible. Location

26

 

on a heavily traveled thoroughfare should be avoided. Since
the pool will serve relatively small numbers of peeple at one
time and since many of these will walk to the pool, a com-
paratively small site or a small portion of a neighborhood
recreation area may be adequate. It should be ample to
make possible plantings and other protection to neighbor-
hood properties. A large pool, on the other hand, providing
a center for city-wide aquatic events and used by people
from a wide radius, requires a considerable area, not only
for the pool and bathhouse, but for the parking of auto-
mobiles. Many of the most successful municipal pools are
located in large parks, which also contain picnic and other
sports facilities which help attract individuals, families, and
community groups. A pool serving an entire community
or a large geographic area should be located where it can
be reached easily by public or private transportation.

Desirable features for a pool site are: easy access to an
adequate water supply; the availability of sewers ample to
permit the pool to be emptied within a few hours without
flooding the basements of nearby homes; a high, dry loca-
tion; a terrain capable of supporting the weight of the pool
without expensive excavation and supports; and satisfactory
subsurface drainage. Locations to be avoided include those
with high prevailing winds, limited exposure to the sun, and
prevalence of dust, smoke, soot and acid resulting from
proximity to factories, unpaved roads, and railroads. The
existence of other recreation facilities on the site or the pos-
sibility of developing them is an advantage.

Whenever the city has a long-range recreation plan, the
pool should be located in relation to it and in any case the
over-all plan of community development should be con-
sidered in locating the site. The present trend toward the
construction of small neighborhood pools reflects the em-
phasis in recreation planning upon the development of facil-
ities near the homes of the people they are designed to serve.

Size of Pool. One of the first questions bound to arise
is, I“How large a pool should we have?” It is one of the
most difficult to answer with authority because attendance
is influenced by climatic conditions, competition from other
recreation facilities, local habits and economic factors, the
program offered, and the quality of operation. Several for-
mulas or criteria have been proposed for estimating the
amount of pool water area required to serve a city’s needs.
Most cities of twenty thousand or less require only one pool;
hence a formula would indicate what its size should be.
Larger cities, on the other hand, are likely to have more than
one pool; and, since these may be designed to serve different
aquatic needs, they vary widely in size. EXperience has
shown that public demand for pools, as for other types of
recreation facilities, often varies directly with the availa-
bility of these facilities; in other words, a city with one or
more successful pools is likely to want more pools and to be
willing to pay for them, whereas cities with no swimming
facilities may evidence little desire to acquire them.

The National Recreation Association has long proposed
that a city provide outdoor swimming space—in pools or
beaches—to take care of three per cent of the population at
one time, allowing 15 square feet of water area per person,

RECREATION

or a total of 450 square feet for each 1,000 people. One
company which has built many pools proposes 200 square
feet of water area foi each 1,000 of the total population the
pool is designed to serve, and warns communities against
building too large a pool.3

The Tile Council of America, in a folder entitled Com-
munity Swimming Pools, suggested typical pool sizes for
communities varying from 4,000 to 90,000 population, rang-
ing from 600 square feet per 1,000 people in the former to
320 square feet per 1,000 in the latter.

The need to qualify any formula for determining the size
of pool area a city needs in the light of local conditions is
illustrated by the situation in Levittown, Long Island, New
York, a new community of nearly 80,000 people. It has
nine outdoor pools, each measuring 75 by 125 feet, or more
than 1,000 square feet of pool area for each 1,000 people.
This amount is far in excess of suggested standards. In
spite of this, and of the fact that Levittown is only a few
miles from the exceptional bathing facilities at Jones Beach
State Park, the pools are so popular that it is often neces-
sary to close the pool gates to prevent overcrowding.

Estimating Pool Capacity. The estimated number of per-
sons who are likely to use the pool for various types of acti-
vities must be taken into account in calculating the required
size. A frequently quoted study of pool attendance, made
at Iowa State College‘ indicates that:

1. The smaller the community the larger the proportion which will
use the pool.

2. For cities under 30,000 the maximum daily attendance will be
between five to ten per cent of the population.

3. The average daily attendance is about two to three per cent of the
population. \

4. Maximum daily attendance at any one time is about one-third of
the daily attendance.

5. Maximum daily attendance will generally be two to six times the
average daily attendance.

6. The attendance at any one time on maximum days is approxi-
mately the same number as the average daily attendance.

One consulting engineer has determined that the people
of a given community with suitable pool facilities may be
eXpected to take a total number of swims equaling twice the
total population.5 He'estimates that the total swims per
season will represent the equivalent of twenty peak load
days, although it may reach the equivalent of twenty-five
or thirty peak load days in municipal pools.

Mr. C. P. L. Nichols, municipal supervisor of aquatics in
Los Angeles, describes the formula he has devised for esti-
mating pool capacity based upon years of study and experi-
ence.6 He allows 15 square feet for each bather and 30
square feet for each swimmer.’ He defines a person using
water less than 5 feet in depth as a bather and one using
water 5 feet or deeper, a swimmer. The formula for deter-
mining patron capacity of any pool is therefore:

Area of shallow water + Area of deep water 2 Total peak capacity

Scene at a Levittown swimming and wading pool clearly illus-
trates popular use of deck space and of the shallow water area.

This figure is multiplied by the number of shifts or peaks
per day to determine the total daily capacity of the pool.
This formula allows more space per patron than the stand-
ard proposed by the American Public Health Association,7
which estimates that 27 square feet of water 5 feet deep or
more or 10 square feet of shallower water is required for
each person in attendance at the pool at one time, whether
in the water or not. This standard when applied to pools
with 75 per cent or more of the area less than 5 feet deep,
calls for about 12 square feet for each person in attendance.

The bathing capacity of a pool is limited also by the water
volume and the amount of clean water added, both fresh
and recirculated. Many states have adopted regulations
governing the total number of bathers that may use a pool
during a given period, and these must be taken into account
in calculating the capacity of a proposed pool.

Costs. Construction costs are one of the first problems
that must be taken into account. Like some of the other
aspects of pool design and construction, cost figures can-
not be standardized, for they are influenced by many fac-
tors. Probable costs are affected not only by local wage and
materials cost-levels, but by the type, size, location, and
shape of pool, the type and size of bathhouse, the purifica-
tion system, and a great variety of construction and equip-
ment items. Until the type of pool facilities desired and
their specific requirements have been determined, at least
tentatively, costs of a project cannot be estimated closely.
Some indication of probable cost ranges may be gained,
however, from the eXperiences of other communities and
of pool designers. The information that follows affords
a basis for estimating roughly the cost of pools of various
sizes, although it should be pointed out that some cities
have reported spending more than twice as much as others
for a pool of similar size and type.

The National Recreation Association made a study of
reported swimming pool costs in sixty-six cities that con-
structed outdoor pools between 1948 and 1952. It revealed
that the pools, not including the cost of bathhouses, cost
on the average between $12.00 and $12.50 per square foot
of water surface, with a median COS’t of $12.04 per square

foot. The average cost of sixty pools, including bathhouses,
was $16.61 per square foot of water surface, with a median

cost of $15.98.
A 1954 study of outdoor pools, conducted by the Confer-

ence for National Cooperation in Aquatics, covered the cost
of sixty-three pools, not including bathhouses, built between
1948 and 1954. The average cost per square foot of water
surface for pools with less than 4,000 square feet was $15.30
and for pools with 4,000 to 6,000 square feet, $11.46 per
square foot. For larger pools the average. costs for three
groups were $12.28, $14.65, and $10.90 respectively.

The opinion that, in general, other factors being compar-
able, the smaller the pool, the larger the cost per square
foot of water area, is confirmed in cost estimates by two
swimming pool designers. The Charles M. Graves Organi-
zation, park and recreation engineers of Atlanta, Georgia,
has worked out the following schedule for estimating pool
costs which include the pool with its fittings, underwater
lights, fencing, deck and mechanical equipment—«every-
thing but the bathhouse itself:

Size of Pool Cost
(square feet of water area) (per square foot of water area)

0- 4,000 51100-31200

4,000- 5,000 10.00- 11.00

5,000- 6,000 9.00- 10.00

6,000- 7,000 8.00- 9.00

7,000- 8,000 7.00- 8.00

8,000-14,000 6.50

It estimated in 1953 that a well-constructed bathhouse could
be built for approximately $12.00 per square foot.

Kenneth H. Larkin, pool designer of Kansas City, Mis-
souri, has prepared a graph indicating estimated costs of
swimming pool projects, which in this instance include the
pool and bathhouse completely equipped and ready for use.
The variation in cost per square foot of water area for pools
of different sizes is evident from the figures for three pools,
taken from the graph:

Square Feet of Estimated Cost per Square Foot
Water Area Total Cost of Water Area
1,800 $30,000 $16.67
4,000 61,000 15.25
9,000 110,000 12.22

Mr. Larkin has also prepared a breakdown of estimated
construction costs for a pool 50 by 100 feet. Of the total
estimated cost of $70,626 for the complete project, $44,091
was allocated to the pool itself and utilities, $18,735 for the
bathhouse, and $7,800 for special features and equipment.
Approximately seven per cent should be added to these
figures to allow for the engineering design fee.

The preceding figures afford some basis for determining
the probable cost range of constructing a pool, but they also
illustrate the variability of such costs as reported by com-
munities building pools in the last few years.

Trends in

 

Swimming Pool Design 1

Primary Considerations

Probably the most basic change in
the thinking of the swimming pool ex-
pert is a greater understanding of the
functions of swimming pools in the
over-all recreation program, together
with the recognition that it is not
enough to plan merely an isolated struc-
ture, but that it should be co-ordinated
with the over-all recreation area and
community program. Consequently, we
see designers integrating the location
and facilities of the swimming pool with
existing and planned future community
facilities. This assures the community
of maximum usage from the pool. The
pool site should be selected carefully in
a park or picnic area which has good
transportation and sufficient parking fa-
cilities. Many architects have seen the
wisdom of cutting costs by getting dou-

28

ble usage from the pool bathhouse as
an athletic locker room for high school
teams or other athletic organizations,

Once the pool is integrated with the
other recreation facilities, a number of
architects analyze the usage of a pool
very carefully. This includes a study of
the ratio of adults to children that will
be using the pool, together with the an-
ticipated ratio of divers, men to wom-
en, swimmers and beginners. Among
adults, men usually outnumber women
two to one. The finished swimmer-to-
beginner ratio is important in that it
determines the ratio of shallow to deep
water.

Next in importance, pool designers
are doing a great deal of thinking about
the ratio of water area to lounging area.
It is being recognized that, more than
ever, people go to a pool to sunbathe
and lounge, so these lounging areas are

increasing in size. With this in mind,
forward-looking designers are increas-
ing the deck area to equal the swimming
area. These lounging areas should be
so located that they can be converted
to spectator space with the erection of
bleachers. I‘

In addition, pool design is concerned '
with whether this is a hot climate where
shade should be provided, or a cool. cli-
mate where all possible sunshine should
be utilized. This question should be
studied from the point of view of both
the swimmers and the loungers.

The design of a pool is being gov-
erned increasingly by thc ratio of
swimmers to non-swimmers. In thc past
it has been rather common to design a
pool in which forty pcr ccnt of the area
is over five feet in depth (which is usu-
ally considercd to be “deep” water).
However, in most public pools it is fre-

quently observed that as high as eighty
per cent of the pe0ple frequent the non-
swimming areas, and, COnsequently,
pools are now being designed with a
higher percentage of the water being
under five feet in depth. Of course, it
is the desire of the designer to have the
pool meet the dimensional requirements
for competitive swimming, but lately
there seems to be a feeling that the basic
problem is to design a pool that will
meet all needs. Consequently, there is
a de-emphasis on ironclad competitive
dimensions.

Lounging Areas

Park commissioners and recreation
directors have all confirmed the fact
that when a pool is designed for a cer-
tain number of people, and that number
has entered the pool area, there is usu-
ally no more than one-third of the peo-
ple in the pool at any one time. The
others are on the sidewalk and loung-
ing areas around the pool. A large per-
centage of these non-swimmers actually
spend very little time in the water and
the rest of the time is spent sunbathing
and in other activities. Pool designers
have very wisely come to the conclusion
that the six- and eight-foot walkways
surrounding pools years ago are today
completely inadequate. They have re-
versed their thinking and are now at the
point where they feel that the walkway
and lounging area should be far larger
—in fact it should approximate the wa-
ter area. Most important to the pool
designer is the fact that, since not more
than one third of the people are in the
pool at any one time, smaller pools with
greater lounging areas will meet the
need, and such pools can be provided at
lower cost. This being the. case, there
is a definite trend. toward designing
smaller pools with larger lounging areas
around them .

In line with the greater emphasis
given to lounging and recreation areas
adjoining swimming pools, 'designers
are going a step further in many cases
by providing areas for refreshment or
eating. These areas are always fenced
off so that no food can be taken back
into the pool area itself.

Other recreational facilities that can
be provided in a pool area include such
games as shufiieboard and also grass or
sand play areas where volleyball, bad-

JANUARY 1955

minton, and other games can be played.
These again must be fenced off from the
pool proper so that entrance and exit to
the immediate pool area can be con-
trolled. Showers are so located that all
sand and dirt can be washed off the
swimmer before he reurns to the pool.

Wading Pools

The practice of providing wading
pools in connection with swimming
pools is a trend which is definitely on
the increase. In the past they have been
located immediately adjacent to the
pool but we now find that the trend is
to move them away from the swimming
area. The reason for this is that there
is usually a mother or sister watching
the toddler in the wading pool. Con-
sequently, a congestion occurs if the
wading pool is too close to the swim-
ming pool.

The play appeal of these wading pools
has been increased by the use of spray
fittings or small fountains. Sand beach-
es are often provided beside the wading
pool. When these wading pools are lo-
cated near the swimmer pools, it is wise
to fence them to prevent the toddlers
from falling into them and also to keep
the swimmers out of the wading area.
Architects are increasingly specifying
additional benches for the comfort of
the parents who accompany the chil-
dren.

Pool experts have recognized the ne-
cessity of using chlorinated water of
pool temperature in the wading pool in
place of the old draw-and-fill method
where the water is cold when it comes in
and then is no longer safe by the time it
warms enough for comfort. Consequent-
ly, the wading pool water is now being
filtered by the same filtration equip-
ment serving the main pool. The water
can thus be cleaned and purified regu-
larly. This is quite necessary because
the pollution is usually higher in the

small pool than in the regular swim-
ming pool.

Bathhouses

A matter that has frequently troubled
the recreation director and park com-

missioner is the high cost of the bath-

house in ratio to the cost of the pool.‘

It frequently has been found that the
bathhouse cost is equal to that of the
entire pool. This does not seem to be

ADMINISTRATION

justified and architects are doing what
they can to eliminate such high costs.
One way to do this is to have the bath-
house used as a locker room for some
other athletic activity, thereby having
this other activity share in its cost.

In the Southwest, dressing rooms are
frequently built without tops in an effort
to cut costs as well as to keep the bath-
house well lighted and dry.

Another trend in bathhouse design is
the recognized necessity of providing
better sanitation. Bathhouses are now
built so that they can be hosed down
and scrubbed with a mild disinfectant.
For this reason most bathhouses now
have floors of concrete slab or non-
glazed ceramic tile, frequent floor
drains, and partitions that are either
open at the top so that wash water can
drain off rapidly, or concrete block or
glazed tile walls with Hoors pitched to
the drains.

Another changing concept is that of

‘the footbath. Many .--,public health offi-

cials now state that a simple flow-
through footbath that is designed to
wash dirt and sand from the feet is the
most practical answer. They reason that
a disinfectant solution strong enough to
last the whole day would burn the feet
during the early morning hours and, if
comfortable for the feet during the
morning, would be diluted and weak-
ened to the point of ineffectiveness dur-
ing the afternoon and evening.

Pool Safety

Water sport promoters, such as the
American Red Cross, have long advo-
cated the use of lifeguard chairs, and
every outdoor pool should have one or
more of these elevated chairs. The ex-
tra height of the chair raises the guard
to the proper level where he can see the
entire area he is to protect. It also raises
him above distractions which occur
around the pool edge. Recently, we have
seen several pool lifeguards armed with
a shepherd’s crook or long bamboo
pole which they extend to a swimmer
who is in difficulty. This seems very
practical in that a lifeguard is certainly
much more effective on. the shore than
he is in the pool.

Making Teen Centers Succeed*

This booklet has been prepared by Sidney C. Lutzin from
a study and evaluation of fifty teen-age centers located in all
sections of New York State. It could well serve as a primer
for organizations or groups contemplating the beginning of
a teen center. There is also much information included that
will prove helpful to those now operating such a program.

This report is written in a very logical and interesting
manner and will appeal to both lay and professional folks.
It describes methods that have been successful, as well as
pointing out the many pitfalls to be avoided. A number of
pictures are used to illustrate specific points.

The author recognizes that the type of teen program will
vary from community to community; however, he very
clearly sets forth the basic principles which are necessary
to insure success in any situation.

One finds in this well-prepared booklet the highlights of
the problems and procedures involved in organizing and
operating a teen center.—FRAN(_:ES DONNON, Executive Sec-

Alumni Rate Undergraduate Courses

As part of a study to determine alumni opinions about
their undergraduate preparation, conducted at Pennsylvania
State University, Charles 0. Micklewright queried thirty-
four recreation graduates. They were asked to rank the
courses in their undergraduate preparation according to the
relative values of the courses to them. The results, as re-
ported in the October 1954 Alumni Newsletter, were:

“The ten courses rated highest by recreation graduates
included (in order of their preference): Student Leader-
ship, Public Speaking, Social Recreation, Practice Teaching,
Recreation Areas and Facilities, Community Recreation,
Playground Management, Recreation Field Practicum, Eng-
lish Composition, and Principles of Recreation.”

Census Bureau Reports 1953 Municipal
Recreation Expenditures

The Compendium of City Government Finances in 1953,
issued in 1954 by the United States Department of Com-
merce, Bureau of the Census, contains valuable information
with reference to municipal finances in 481 cities with a
population of 25,000 or more. The following items are
taken from this publication which is available from the
United States Government Printing Office, Washington 25,
D. C. at 3.70 per copy.

The 1953 expenditures for recreation totaled $259,465,-
000; of this amount $199,000,000 were for current expense

and $60,000,000 were for capital outlay, including $46,000,-
000 for construction only.

REVIEWS AND ABSTRACTS

George D. Butler

1‘

The 1953 expenditures represented an 11.1 per cent in-
crease over the comparable 1952 figure. This was a rela-
tively greater increase than for any other function except
general public buildings. However, the 1952 total was only
slightly greater than the corresponding total for 1951.

The average per capita expenditure for recreation for

1953 was $4.19. This varied from $3.28 per capita in 126
cities of 50,000 to 100,000 to $5.68 per capita in 13 cities

of 500,000 to 1,000,000. (The average expenditure for
libraries in the 481 cities was $1.42 per capita.)

The percentage of increase from 1952 to 1953 varied from
1.6 per cent in the 5 cities of 1,000,000 or more to 22.9 per

cent in 65 cities of 100,000 to 250,000.

Property taxes accounted for about three-fourths of local
tax revenue in 1953. Inter-governmental revenue—prima-
rily fiscal aid and reimbursements from state governments
——-was the second largest revenue source.

Spending was higher than in 1952 for all major municipal
functions with the exception of public welfare, for which
a slight decline took place. H

Recreation is defined as follows in the Census report:
“Cultural-scientific activities, such as museums and art gal-
leries; organized recreation, including playgrounds and
playfields, swimming pools and bathing beaches; municipal
parks; and special facilities for recreation, such as audi-
toriums, stadiums, auto camps, recreation piers, and yacht
harbors.”

State Survey of Swimming Pools

The California State Department of Education has com-
pleted a survey of swimming pools in the state revealing an
estimated total of approximately 19,300 pools.

A total of 412 pools Open to the public or to certain age
levels for instruction and recreation include 117 owned and
operated by cities or communities, 117 privately or com-
mercially owned and operated but open for either limited or
unrestricted public use, 87 on high school grounds, 20 owned
and operated by counties, 20 by colleges or universities, 29
by elementary or unified school districts, 14 jointly financed
and operated by schools or other governing agencies, and 8
by recreation districts. Fifty-one new pools, most of them
on school grounds, are now being built or are in the planning
and drawing board stages.

Swimming pools with restricted use include a conserva-
tive estimate of 18,500 private swimming pools, 270 pools
maintained by hotels, motels, resorts, and so on, and 40
pools owned by private and parochial schools, clubs and
private agencies.

For {if-Fold Purpose

Robert A. Lobdell

0R SOME time the public recreation
Fcommission of Evansville, Indiana,
has been envious of the activities in
other cities centered around a show
wagon. In the past we have stumbled
along on a makeshift basis with our
talent shows and street dances. Consid-
ering the poor facilities that we were
forced to use as a stage, we experienced
a fair amount of success. Realizing the
need of a better stage and one which
was portable and self-contained, the
commission authorized the construction
of a show wagon for the 1954 summer
season.

Before making plans and specifica-
tions for the show wagon, it was neces-
sary to determine the use that would be
made of it, including the variety of acti-
vities possible with such a piece of
equipment. After careful deliberation
and taking a sample of interests on a
playground, it was determined the wag-
on should be built to serve at least a
three-fold purpose. It was recognized
that an investment of this kind must
produce a considerable amount of par-
ticipant activity in a variety of fields
and be usable frequently enough to
warrant the expenditure. Therefore, we
designed the wagon so it could be used
for talent shows, street dances, and chil-
dren’s summer theatre.

With these three activities in mind,
the design was created to meet the needs
of each of them. It was our objective
to produce a show wagon that would be
completely portable, well lighted, have

good sound, sturdy enough to take the
rough treatment of continual movement
from playground to playground, and
large enough to meet our needs.

We wrote to several other depart-
ments, who, we had heard, had consid-

erable success with show wagon Opera-

tion, to get their recommendations as
to size and type of construction. These
recommendations proved of consider-
able help in making our final plans.

Don’t wait until April or May to start
construction of your show wagon for
summer use. Many difficulties are sure
to be encountered. Even though we
started in January 1954, we didn’t have
much time to Spare in completing the
project prior to the opening of the sum-
mer program. In order that other de-
partments might take advantage of our
eXperiences, we have engaged an archi-
tect; and complete plans, specifications,
and pictures of the completed show
wagon are available by writing to the
Public Recreation Commission, 2
Southeast Eighth Strect, Evansville, In-
diana.

The Show wagon is 28 feet long, has
a height of 10% feet above the ground,
with a center section roof which may be
raised to give additional stage height.
With the side dropped into position, it
gives a stage depth of approximately 15
feet. While in transit, with the side in
folded position, it is 71/2 feet wide. It
is fully equipped with safety reflectors,
directional turn signals, tail- and stop-
lights which are connected to its 1%-
ton truck. It is completely wired with
all circuits of 110 volts with a supply
line to thc wagon requiring 220 volts.

on the basis of either plugging into a
220-volt-range receptacle, which is
found in most home economic rooms in
school buildings. We also had a 5,000-
watt generator which could be used in
the event that regular current was not
available. We carried 250 feet of No. 4
3-wire cable to bring the current to the
show wagon.

The chassis of the show wagon was
constructed by the students at the Me-
chanic Arts High School, the only cost
to our department being for the mate-
rials used. The balance of the wagon
was constructed by the maintenance sec-
tion of our recreation department,
which helped keep the cost to an abso-
lute minimum.

As can be seen by the pictures of the
show wagon, the outside design carried
out the theme of the three activities for
which it was constructed. Both sides
were painted identically and both ends
were painted identically. The designs
on the sides depicted: talent show use,
by the clown figures at the extreme left;
the street dance program, by the music
staff in the lower center of the side; the
summer children’s theatre, by the the-
atre masks at the right. The structural
details are too numerous to explain
here; but, as mentioned before, the com-
plete plans are available.

The wagon was used five nights a
week throughout the summer season. As
part of our summcr music program a
seventeen piece dance band made up of
high school students was organized and
it played in addition to a regular Sun-
day afternoon radio program, at a street
dance each Tuesday night at the various
playground locations throughout the

city. The show wagon was used as a
stage for the band.

Our talent shows were under the su-
pervision of a specialist who arriVed at
a playground on Monday and organ-
ized, costumed, and directed the pro-
gram, which was produced on Friday
night. The following week the specialist
moved to another playground. The show
wagon was used each Friday night for
this purpose.

The third activity use of the wagon
was devoted to children’s summer thea-
ter. This made up the largest activity
operation of the wagon and proved to
be very successful. In cooperation with
the public schools and Evansville Col-
lege, it was decided to promote the pro~
gram with seventh- and eighth-grade
students in four grade-school areas geo-
graphically spaced throughout the city,
so that all the children might be given
an opportunity to participate.

Early -in April we conducted assem-
blies during school hours at the various
grade schools selected. To these we in-
vited parochial as well as public school
students. At this time a scale model of
the show wagon was, shown to the chil-
dren and the general plan of organiza-
tion was explained. Each school area
was considered an operating unit. For
example, unit number one was organ-
ized during the middle of April, started
their rehearsals, costuming, and scenery
construction, and then produced the
play, selected by their group, for a two-
week period beginning June 21. They
were scheduled to give their production
for two nights at their home playground
so that, in case of inclement weather
the first night, they would have an op-

JANUARY 1955

 

portunity to perform before their
friends at least one night. They pro-
duced their play six times during the
ensuing two-week period, twice at their
own playground and four times at other
playgrounds in that vicinity; thereby
using the show wagon three nights of
the week. Units two, three, and four,
produced their plays in the ,same man-
ner, each for a two~week period. All
the organization work of each unit
was completed before school vacation
started. Some rehearsal schedules were
necessarily started before school ended.

The supervision of the summer chil-
dren’s theatre was made possible
through the cooperation of Evansville
College. Howard Hill, assistant profes-
sor in charge of dramatics at the college,
served as the director of the project,
and three college seniors who had
majored in dramatics served as direc-
tors of each of the individual units men-
tioned above. One student directed both
number one and number four units.

In addition to five-night-a-week use
by the department, the commission au-
thorized use of the show wagon by any
charitable or non-profit organization

 

when it was not_ being used by the de-
partment. A flat rental fee of fifty dol-
lars was charged for one evening, which
included light, sound, and labor neces-
sary in setting it up for operation. It
was rented several times on this basis
by different organizations. Liability
insurance was purchased and added to
the blanket fleet policy carried by the
city on all vehicles.

The success of the operation of the
show wagon depended upon good pro-
gram planning. The success of its struc-
ture was based upon careful prelimi-
nary plans. At the end of the summer
an evaluation, with the directors of its
various activities and with the mainten~
ance staff responsible for moving and
setting it up, surprisingly revealed not
a single suggestion for improving it or
changing the structural design. We feel
that this indicates a completely success-
ful project.

The construction and operation of a
show wagon is not easy, but it has
proved to be one of the greatest public
relations mediums that we have had for
our department. It makes possible a
greater variety of activity Opportunities
and helps to prove that recreation can
be something more than just sports and

games.

Perhaps you wonder how much it
cost. Because high school students con-
structed the chassis and our own main-
tenance department did the other con-
struction, we were able to keep the over-
all cost at a minimum. The materials
and equipment were approximately
$2,500. This may seem high but, con-
sidering that it was used five nights a
week last summer and has many years
ahead of it, the figure is very low. It
certainly is an asset to any department
to have a good show wagon.

Ready for performance. Roof is raised; spotlight and footlights placed in position.

Japan Recreation Congress

At J apan’s Eighth Annual Recreation
Congress, some of the Observations on
the recreation picture in that country,
according to a report received from
Earle R. Buckley of the National Com-
mittee; Young Men’s Christian Associa-
tions of Japan, were: (1) rural recrea-
tion, family recreation, and employee
recreation are all increasing; (2) school
facilities are becoming more available
for community recreation uses, and
there is also a gain in adult education-
recreation classes; (3) active participa-
tion in programs by older people is
growing; (4) leadership is still the ma-
jor problem in recreation in Japan to-
day. In general, the lectures and dis-
cussions showed the result of healthy
research on the part of the speakers and
the other participants.

Featured activities were such dis-
tinctly Japanese forms of recreation as
the Haiku (seventeen-syllable Japanese
poem), the famous Japanese tea cere-
mony, Chinese character calligraphy,
Japanese style of painting, and other
national pursuits. The Haiku demon-
stration was an outstanding program.
Three hundred monthly magazines with
approximately a million readers are de-
voted to this absorbing national pas-

time of wr1t1ng a poem to express a
hope, mood, experience, or passing
thought.

The four days of meetings were timed
to end as the nationally famous Star
Festival in Sendai got under way. In-
strumental in the success of the congress
were the efforts of His Highness Prince
Mikasa, Soichi Saito, president of the
Japan NRA, and Chairman Yoshikiko

Conservation Notes

0 Conservation” forces have won some
impressive victories of late. A million-
dollar contribution by John D. Rocke-
feller, Jr., to the Save-the-Redwoods
League, has assured preservation of the
impressive primeval forest in Califor-
nia’s Calaveras South Grove of Giant
Sequoias as a state park. Chairman
Joseph R. Knowland of the California
State Park Commission says the pro-
posed park contains a thousand giant
Sierra redwoods as well as superlative
stands of sugar pine, ponderosa pine,
and other species.

0 Meanwhile the Corkscrew Cypress
Rookery Association won its battle to
save a wilderness of thousand-year-old,
125-foot high trees from extinction. The
country’s last great stand of bald cy-
press, known as “the redwood of the
east,” in southwest Florida, southeast
of Fort Myers, will be preserved in the
public interest.

0 Another unique conservation organi-

Show in Memory of E. T. Attwell

The Louisville, Kentucky, Depart-
ment of Parks and Recreation recently
presented an original fantasy, “Kaleido-
scope,” an extravaganza of twenty-six
numbers, two acts. The show was‘dedi-
cated to the memory of Ernest T. Att-
well, who was for thirty years a member
of the National Recreation Association
staff (See RECREATION, September
1949) . It was written and produced by
Mrs. William Moore, Wife of the gen-
eral superintendent of parks and recrea-
tion. Music was furnished free by the
local musicians’ union, and mothers of
the College Court Housing Project took
charge of the make-up department. The
show, with its all-Negro cast of 140
members ranging in age from six to
sixty, was presented without charge to
an audience of 3,400. The pensive little

How To Start
Synchronized
Swimming

YNCHRONIZED swimming is a comparatively new field of
S rhythmic experience through swimming movements.
Under good leadership it can be a highly creative activity.
It is not difficult to teach or use in aquatic programs if the
basic principles involved are understood. The term “syn-
chronized swimming” usually denotes rhythmic swimming
movements performed in a definite pattern to synchronize
with a prescribed accompaniment. Several criteria for good
synchronized swimming are:

1. Swimming strokes, or strokes and swimming stunts, or varia-
tions of these are combined on the basis of a selected accompaniment.

2. These are performed in rhythm to a prescribed accompaniment
and/or rhythmical pattern.

3. When more than one swimmer participates, the action is per-
formed in unison or in a definite order.

Strokes in Synchronized Swimming

All recognized swimming strokes and many adaptations
and variations of each stroke are used. As a basic means of
locomotion in water, the importance of these strokes—the
front crawl, back crawl, side stroke, side overarm, trudgen,
breast stroke, butterfly breast stroke, inverted breast stroke,
and elementary backstroke———can not be overemphasized.

Decide on the Form of Each Stroke

There are many variations of each swimming stroke in
use at the present time. Since synchronized swimming
strokes should be performed in an identical manner, the
teacher, coach, and/or swimming group should decide on
the form or style which may be best adapted to their particu-
lar situation.

Most strokes need to be adapted for their use in synchro-
nized swimming. Stress the following for all strokes:

1. Keep the faces above water so that the swimmers may
hear the accompaniment and see the rest of the group.

2. Lower the kick sufficiently so that there is no breaking
of the water, i.e. no splash of the feet.

3. The parts of the swimmers visible above the water are
the heads and the arms. Therefore, it is of great importance
in duo or group synchronized swimming that the arm action
be practiced so that the lift from the water, the speed and
direction of the arm movement through the air, and the
position and timing of the catch will he simultaneous.

4. Excellent control of breathing and “water poise”

Betty Spears

(sense of body position in the water) are essential for ad-
vanced synchronized swimming.

Work on Synchronization

1. Each swimmer should learn and practice every stroke
until it meets the standard set by the grOUp and until he can
keep “time” with simple accompaniment, such as the beat of
a drum.

2. The group should learn and practice every stroke until
their actions are synchronized.

3. The swimmers should be synchronized to each other
and to the accompaniment.

a. From the very first practice the swimmers should syn-

chronize and swim with the music as an accompaniment

——not with the music as background.

b. Analyze the accompaniment (recordings, drum, piano,

and so on) for the basic beat and / or accent. Decide when

the catch of the stroke should be made, the recovery

should be made, the glide should be made, which part of

the stroke should be accented, and so on.

0. Remember, movements in the water are slower than

those in the air. Allow for water resistance in analyzing

the accompaniment and in planning movements.

Most forms of accompaniment are written with notes
which are grouped into measures. Measures are grouped to
form phrases, and a group of measures form a composition.

 

I.—--Catch with left hand K——-Kick

R—-—Catch with right hand

Above are four measures of 3%; or waltz time. In swim-
ming the front crawl to this rhythm each note denotes a
kick, and the catch is made with alternate arms on the
first beat of every measure.

Below is the first line of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”
analyzed for swimming with the front crawl.

 

R—-—Catch with right hand

L—Catch with left hand

Sing it to yourself, stroke it with your arms, and see how
the natural place for the catch is at the beginning of Row
(catch left), Row (catch right), and so on, OR the begin-
ning of a measure. This is stroking on the accent. ln strokes

with glides, the stroke motion usually comes on one meas-
ure and the glide on the next. Try it with “Row, Row, Row
Your Boat”-—-—Row (breast stroke), Row (glide), Row

(breast stroke), and so on. A
In the following, some few basic strokes are more thor-

oughly analyzed. Use not only the strokes suggested here,
but all standard strokes in your total program.

Front Crawl

Body position: 0n face in an extended position with legs
under the surface of the water and the face above the water.

Analysis: The kick is an alternate vertical thrash of the '

entire leg with the action from the hips and with the knees
and ankles relaxed. Arm action is started with the arm
straight in front of the body and on a line with the shoulder.
With the fingertips entering the water first, the arm presses
down under the shoulder to a vertical position. The elbow
lifts upward until the entire arm is above water and then the
forearm moves forward to the position for the catch.

Coordination: The arms move alternately making one
complete action to every six to eight kicks.

Analysis with accompaniment: The catch is made on the
accent. The kick is even and there is a kick made on each
beaL

 

L—Catch with left hand K—Kick

R—Catch with right hand

This analysis is only a suggestion and other parts of the
stroke may be used for accent. While the waltz-is analyzed
above, any meter with suitable rhythm may be used.

Back Crawl

Body position: Extended position on the back with the
hips slightly lower than the shoulders.' The chin is tucked.
Analysis: The legs kick alternately with a vertical “whip”

from the hips with the knees and ankles relaxed. On the .

catch the arm is extended diagonally overhead. The arms
pull alternately from the “Y” position. The fingertips enter
the water first and the pull, which is parallel to the surface

of the water, continues directly to the thigh. During the

recovery the arm swings in an are above the water to the
position for the catch. U

Coordination: The arms make one complete action to
every six to eight kicks.

Analysis with accompaniment: The catch may be made on
the accent. The kick is even and there is a kick on each beat.

 

R—Catch with right hand

l—Catch with left hand K—Kick
I

All swimming strokes should be analyzed and practiced
until the swimmers and coach are satisfied with the per-
formance individually and as a whole.

Stroke Variations

Swimming strokes serve as the basic water movements for
synchronized swimming just as the waltz, polka, schottische,

JANUARY 1955

 

and so forth, form the basic steps for folk dances. Frequently
the rhythmic pattern of the accompaniment may be made
more interesting by varying the stroke. Certain parts of the
recovery may be accented, arm actions may be performed
above the Water, or the action of the stroke itself may be
changed to make the swimming action more synchronized
with the music or the accompaniment used.

Stunts in Synchronized Swimming

Water stunts, with swimming strokes, form the two basic
types of movements used in this type of swimming. These
stunts, which may be described as movements around an
axis of the body, may be performed above, on, or below the
surface of the water, or in combinations.

Stunts may be performed in three different body positions
or in combinations of these. These correspond to those used
in fancy diving:

Tuck position: The body is bunched with the knees and
hips completely flexed (bent) and the toes pointed.

Pike position: The body is bent at the hips which are
held at right angles to the trunk.

Layout position: The body is extended with both hips
and knees held straight and the toes pointed.

Swimmers Should Learn Fundamental Starting Positions

Back sculling position: In this 'position the swimmer is
on the back. The legs are held together with knees straight
and the toes pointed. The hips are slightly lower than the
shoulders or toes. The chin is tucked with the head high
enough to see other swimmers. The placement of the arms
depends upon the stunt to be performed, but in the basic
position they are at the sides, usually a little lower than the

' hips.

Front layout position: This is similar to the prone float,
but the head is above water and the legs are held together
in an extended position with the knees straight and the toes
pointed. The placement of the arms depends upon the stunt
to be performed, but in the basic position they are under
the body near the sides.

Sculling: Sculling is one of the basic skills needed for
performing stunts in synchronized swimming. It should be
thoroughly. mastered. Presented below is an analysis of
elementary sculling.

Head first sculling: Hold the body in the starting posi-
tion. The arms perform the action simultaneously and con-
tinuously. During the recovery phase, turn the palms down
and out, using a supplementary action in upper arm and
shoulder; then whip the palms toward the feet and back
to the starting position. -This is sometimes described as
a figure-eight motion.

While sculling is the basis for well-performed stunts, the
group should master a variety of stunts. Analysis of stunts
may be found in Beginning Synchronized Swimming, or
other references listed by Mr. Hendricks (see page 23).

Stroke and Stunt Combinations

The skillful combination of strokes and stunts is the basis
of effective, well-performed synchronized swimming. The
swimmers will need to master several techniques. They will

37

- PROGRAM

need to learn how to effect a smooth and efiortless appear-
ance in the continuity of various water movements; to know
the exact timing of stunts and of underwater movements
and to relate this to stroking; to adjust spacing in a forma-
tion easily and inconspicuously; to anticipate strokes and
stunts by “getting set” for the next movement; and to adapt
a situation to the best interests of the group. Good indi-
vidual performance is essential to group work.

Procedures in Composing a Synchronized
Swimming Routine

Routine Based on Accompaniment F orm such as Recording,
Song, or Poem

1. Listen to and analyze the accompaniment: (a) find
the underlying beat and learn the basic rhythm; (b) ana-
lyze for phrases; (c) analyze for themes; (d) find the
climax.

2. Discover the types of water movements (strokes and
stunts) which best express the basic melodies or rhythms
of the music: (a) try the basic ideas in the water; (b)
experiment with strokes, variations, hybrids, stunts, spe-

cial effects and original activities.

3. With these ideas in mind, listen to the accompaniment
again and make a tentative structure of the routine: (a)
entrance; (b) basic strokes—remember, you don’t have to
use every stroke and stunt in each routine; variety is neces-
sary for interest but tOO much variety is confusing; (c)
climax—this should be the fulfillment of the idea and of the
accompaniment; (d) exit.

4. Plan a tentative “space pattern” with the techniques
evolved in 3.

5. Try the routine in the water. At this stage of develop-
ment, allow for unlearned skills, space for the correct num-
ber of performers, and so on. Finish choreography.

6. Check movements planned with the accompaniment.
Does it really express the mood and quality of the music?
After this, go over it with the correct number of swimmers.

7. Try the routine again in the water. If you are not satis-
fied, don’t be discouraged. It takes time to create a worth-
while routine. Changes will probably have to be made.
Learn the routine! Perform the routine! Have fun through-
out!

 

Fighting the Litter-Bugs

Twenty-three of the nation’s largest firms have pledged
funds for the anti-litter campaign of Keep America Beauti-
ful, Inc., a non-profit organization which will devote a 1954-
55 budget Of $400,000 tO supplement anti-litter, programs
already in existence and inaugurate field service programs
in new areas. Smith Rairdon, vice-president of the Owens-
Illinois Glass Company is president of KAB and William C.
Stolk, president of the American Can Company, is chair-
man Of the board of directors.

A recently organized National Advisory Council, com-
posed of national, civic, and service organizations, with
Joseph Prendergast as the chairman, will advise the board
of directors of KAB on how best to conduct its national pro-
gram of education and how to use the resources of the in-
dividual council organizations in the fight against litter.
Members of this council, in addition to the National Recrea-
tion Association, include such groups as the Camp Fire
Girls, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, General Federation of
Women’s Clubs, Izaak Walton League, American Institute
of Park Executives, U. 5. Junior Chamber of Commerce,
and the American Legion.

Mr. Stolk declares it costs $30,000,000 annually in federal,

state, and local funds to clear the nation’s highways, beaches,
and parks of carelessly strewn trash.

The Oakland, California, Park Department recently sta-
tioned a unique kangaroo trash can at Children’s Fairyland
in Lakeside Park. Designed to appeal particularly to young-
sters, the kangaroo is constructed of plastic-laminated glass-
cloth on a wood and chicken-wire frame and is inexpensive,
strong, and easy to build. Trash is placed in the animal’s
pouch, and a galvanized metal container inside the body is
removable from a door in the animal’s hack. Visiting groups
are provided with paper bags for accumulated lunch wrap-

pings, candy wrappers, and other litter stuff. These attract-
ively illustrated bags carry the verse: “

DON’T BE A LITTER BUG!

DON’T BE A CLUTTER BUG!
TRISHY-TRASHY RAGS AND TAG ——
PUT THEM IN THIS LITTER BAG.

, Los Angeles also adopted a kangaroo as its symbol of
public cleanliness in a year-round campaign to keep parks,
roadsides, and beaches clean. Thousands Of decals Of
“Parky the kangaroo,” were made available through various
municipal crnployees’ associations; and six thousand bright
yellow trash receptacles with Parky and his slogan, “Help
Keep Your Parks, lioadsides, and Beaches Clean,” were
placed in park and beach are‘as. For a six-month period a
likeness of Parky was also used as a cancellation mark on
first-class mail leaving the Los Angeles Post Ollice.

A KLONDYKE

15497?

An idea adaptable to many groups; young
adults and servicemen would love it.

For the past seven years the annual Klondyke Party has
been the top party of the year for Arvidians. Sponsored by
the local square dance group, who call themselves the Arvida
College of Square Dancing, it has raised over $5,000 for
local youth organizations. Arvida, the Aluminum City, lo-
cated in the picturesque Saguenay District of the Province
of Quebec, is rich in entertainment talent; and the stage
shows featured at every Klondyke Party are almost in the
professional class.

The Klondyke Party is so popular that the invitation list
is closed one month in advance. The organizing committee
notifies all former Klondykers of the date of the party and
opens an office, for five days, at which invitations may be
picked up. Vacancies are filled from a waiting list. The
cost per couple is a modest two dollars and, as accommoda-
tion is limited to one hundred and fifty couples, it is a ticket
chairman’s dream; his only trouble is advising people that
they will be accommodated if there is a vacancy. Invita-
tions can be transferred only through the ticket chairman,
and all those attending are expected to work on one of the
numerous committees. No one is overworked and two hun-
dred people have specific jobs either prior to or at the party.

Costumes Set Atmosphere

Everyone is expected to come in costume, and the era——
the Klondyke of the nineties—seems to provide plenty of
scope for the imagination. Prizes are awarded for the best,
most original, and most comic costumes; and five candi-
dates are selected by the judges and Winners are determined
by audience applause at suppertime. A beard and moustache
contest is also popular, and crepe hair and spirit gum can
be purchased when invitations are picked up.

Klondyke night is not purely a local affair, as a number
of invitations are made available to groups in the neighbor-
ing towns. Former Klondykers living in Montreal, three
hundred miles away, sometimes arrange their business
schedules to be in Arvida to join in the fun.

As fifty per cent of those attending have some knowledge
of square dancing, four sets make up the dancing part of the

program. An old-time silent movie and two stage shows of
forty minutes each provide the necessary breathers.

The stage show follows a theme such as “Payday at Kiti-
mat”—a skit on the Aluminum Company’s new smelter in
British Columbia—as a number of former Arvida citizens
have been transferred to Kitimat. The theme provides plenty
of material for wisecracks. Skits and songs poking fun at
local situations are very‘popular. Phony radio and televi-
sion broadcasts using tape recordings and home-made mov-
ies have also been very effective. Those taking part in the
stage shows rehearse their numbers separately, and the
whole is tied together by the M.C. The stage invariably rep-
resents an old-time barroom using“ any backdrop that is
available, a bar and several tables, plus a number of suitable
wall signs. No general rehearsals are held, and as everyone
knows that good timing is essential for the success of the
party, being on time is taken for granted.

I

Hall Arrangement Is Simple

A long table across the front of the hall is used as a bar
for the serving of soft drinks. This is one of the few parties
in this section of the country where no liquor is served: Its
success depends upon good organization and “whole-hearted
enthusiastic cooperation.”

Additional long tables in the rear of the hall are used to
set out box lunches, arranged in alphabetically marked sec-
tions. Cups and coffee urns are located on another table.
Two rows of chairs along the side walls provide limited
seating, as the majority of the guests sit on the floor for the
entertainment and supper. The hall can be set up in an hour
and is ready for the following group early the next day.
Members of the organizing committee work hard prior to the
party, but can relax and enjoy themselves on the night of
the Klondyke. Everyone is expected to do something, but
no one is given an assignment that takes more than one hour.
Confusion is conspicuous by its absence.

Many Committees Appointed

The square dance group appoints a committee to run the
party. The date is set and the hall booked six months in
advance. The commmittee receives requests for funds and
decides how they will be allotted on a percentage basis. There

RECREATION

are no complimentary tickets and expenses never exceed
twenty per cent of the receipts. Additional committees are
appointed for program, invitations, makeup, prizes, costume
and moustache udges, reception committee, bartenders, out-
of-town delegation leaders, music, square and round dance
programs.

The program committee decides on a general theme and
ideas for skits or acts. Three pianists are appointed, and
soloists and quartet chorus lines practice with the pianist
who will play for them the night of the party. If movies and
recording tapes are used, experts look after these assign-
ments. A scriptwriter is commissioned to write a melodrama.
The person in charge of each part of the program is given a
time limit. The writer acts as coordinator for all.

The band which plays for the square dance classes held;

during the year has one rehearsal to brush up on numbers
to be used. Individual performers have more confidence in
working with the music they have practiced with and, conse-
quently, are under less pressure. Quartets, as well as ladies’
duets, are used to back up the caller in some numbers. The
orchestra plays for general dancing only. Various games
have been tried from time to time to give more atmosphere
but people generally are too busy to bother with them.

The ten ladies on the refreshment committee receive the
complete guest list. They telephone each guest and ask him
or her to bring a box lunch. Bachelors are asked to supply
sugar, cream, paper plates, napkins, wooden spoons, and
pickles. Cups are loaned by local merchants. Coffee is made
by the local hotel and is transported to the hall in two ten-
gallon construction-camp-type coffee urns with spigots. Cof-
fee pourers provide themselves with buckets to catch the drip
so as not to flood the dance floor.

The refreshment committee is on hand to instruct guests
to deposit their lunches in the lettered squares on tables re-

 

served for that purpose. By dividing the guests into alpha-
betical groups, ten divisions only are necessary. When sup-
per is served each alphabetical group collects their lunches—
the ladies the lunch, and the men the coffee—as the M.C.
calls out the various letters. This system prevents confusion
and is surprisingly simple. Each box is marked with the
owner’s name, and the M.C. receives his cue from a member
of the refreshment committee as to when to call up the next
group. Someone is paid to wash and repack the cups in
cartons so the ladies’ duties are surprisingly light. .

The judges for the various events make a list of candi-
dates for the different contests and turn it over to the M.C.,
who conducts the judging by audience applause during the
lunch hour. The costumes are so numerous and good that
this system has been found the most practical; also, it pro-
vides added entertainment during what might develop into
a draggy part of the program. Prizes solicited from local
merchants are modest ones. It is felt that bigger and better
prizes would eventually spoil the spirit of good clean fun that
now exists. Good costumes are important and admired but
they are just part of the fun. Many expensive prizes have
been refused, much to the surprise of the merchants.

The bartenders who sell soft drinks and the reception or
door committee members are divided into one-hour shifts so
that no one is prevented from taking part in the program.

Each year when Klondyke Night rolls around, old grads
write in and the theme is always the same: “Have fun, wish
we could make it!”

As a result of the activities of the Arvida College of Square Danc-
ing, square dancing is part of the program of many local social
evenings and a number of playroom parties. The “College” has made
a two-hour recorded program of dances which is on loan for parties.
A number of graduates have organized other groups in various parts
of Canada; this year a Junior Klondyke Party was a huge success.

 

COSTUME CONTEST AT A LIBRARY

Silvia Schuster

A contest in which children repre-
sented their favorite book or story char-
acters drew a guest crowd of several
hundred adults to the North Milwaukee
Branch Library when it dedicated its
newly enlarged building.

Miss Margaret Dewitz and her library
staff started work on this good-will-
building contest idea about two months
before the open house and dedication.
She knew that several prominent Mil-
waukeeans would be included in the
dedication program, but she wanted the
many hundreds of children who would
come to the library for this occasion to
play a big part, too.

The North Park Garden Women’s
Club members were called upon for
extra hostess help. These women had

JANUAaY 1955

proved devoted friends already—it had
been largely owing to their civic efforts
that this suburb was granted a library
building of its own. Local merchants,
who were members of the Thirty-fifth
and Villard Avenue Businessmen’s As-
sociation, donated refreshments and the
four top prizes for the best costumes.

Entry blanks were printed; and store
window posters were made and passed
out to the local business‘ places. The
posters were put up about two weeks in
advance of the dedication day event so
that children who wanted to create cos-
tumes and enter the contest would have
enough time for preparations.

On the day of the big event—a Sun-
day—a platform was set up in front of
the library building, and the program
was presented from this. The opening
singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner”
was followed by accordion solos by
pupils from a nearby music school and

brief talks by library personnel and
community leaders.

The highlight of the program came
next: the parade of forty-eight gaily
clad storybook children. Each one had
a large paper with a number on it at-
tached to one shoulder to facilitate the
judging; and the winners were an-
nounced at the close of the parade. The
costume characterizations chosen as
best were: Long John Silver, complete
with a peg leg and authentic looking pi-
rate’s outfit; Aladdin, holding her moth-
er’s best tea pot as her lamp; the White
Rabbit from Alice’s Adventures in Won-
derland; and little Rumpelstilstskin.

The public was then invited into the
building to inspect the newly enlarged
quarters and to enjoy the cooling
orange drinks and cake. The program
was a lot of work, but the result was
worth it in the community spirit and
good will engendered.

Records

0 The difficulty of improving the singing
or speaking voice without the aid of a
vocal coach has been solved in part by
two recent record releases. The first is
a Canfield Voco-Record album (eight
10-inch sides, 78 rpm) designed to help
salesmen, businessmen, actors, students,
public speakers or readers limber throat
muscles and develop more pleasing
voices. This album should be of par-
ticular help to schools, choir and other
singing groups in rural areas where
there is no regular voice teacher. The
set costs $36.00 and is obtainable from
Canfield Voco-Records, 2018 Fifth Ave-

nue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

0 For vocalists who need practice in
singing with..a professional accompan-
ist, Murlyn Recordings have issued a
new series of 12-inch LP high-fidelity
discs which feature songs sung by an
outstanding professional artist. After
each song the accompaniment is replay-

ETV 'Roundup

St. Louis has opened its educational
TV station KETC, the seventh non-com-
mercial station in the country. There
are thirteen other ETV stations in vari-
ous stages of construction throughout
the nation. Students of Edison Tech-
nical School in Seattle have built and
will operate the technical parts of KCTS-
TV, the city’s community television
service. About $2,000 in labor costs
were saved, and operating costs of the

station will be reduced by about $30,000

per year by using technical student vol-
unteers.

Chicago’s WTTW, to open this Spring,
has appointed Dr. John W. Taylor its
executive director. Dr. Taylor, a spe-
cialist in community education, pio-
neered in the use of radio and TV for
teaching. As president of the Univer-
sity of Louisville, he inaugurated, in
1948, the first college course for credit
presented over a commercial radio and
in 1950 the first college course for credit
over TV. In addition, he established
“neighborhood colleges” in Louisville
public libraries for members of the com-
munity who could not afford a college
education.

The FCC has reserved 245 channels
for educational TV stations. The chal-
lenge and problems of developing these
channels is assessed in a new pamphlet,

What Educational Television Ojfers
You, by Jack Mabley, radio and tele-
vision critic of the Chicago Daily News,
available for twenty-five cents from the

Public Affairs Committee, 22 East 38th
Street, New York.

Among the types of programs the
public can expect on non-commercial
channels, says Mr. Mabley, are class-
room instruction for public schools, di-
rect adult education, community pro-
gramming, out-of-schools programs for
children, and general cultural and en-
tertainment programs.

The questions are asked frequently:
“What is the most active season for
personnel in the recreation field?”
“What are the slow periods?” We have
tried to answer these questions for our-
selves, for a long time, without too much
success. There seems to be no special
pattern, and the situation is not always
the same year after year. In othcr
words, personnel seems to be no reSpec-
tor of seasons or of the calendar.

There are some who take for granted
that the summer months, primarily July
and August, represent an off-season.
This is not an accurate assumption.
Last August the Recreation Personnel
Service handled a total of 2,771 pieces
of incoming and outgoing first-class
mail: 451 individuals were transferred
from the active to the inactive list or
vice versa; 29 new positions were re-
ported; 41 positions were filled; 118
confidential personnel records were
made up and submitted to prospective
employers upon request; 50 individuals
were interviewed; 582 referrals were
made; 48 people registered with the
Association for the first time. The types
of positions handled and the areas of
placement included executives, assist-
ants, SUpervisors and leaders in con-
nection with municipal recreation,
schools, Police Athletic
League, American Red Cross, voluntary
youth serving agencies, and teen centers.

Many individuals think of the fall,
particularly October, as being a most
active mOnth for personnel. This is
true in general but October, at least for
1954, was pretty much like August
which preceded it. The Personnel Serv-
ice handled 2,386 incoming and outgo-
ing pieces of first-class mail; 99 indi-
viduals were transferred from inactive
roles to the active, or vice vcrsa; 62 new
positions were reported; 37 positions
were filled; confidential personnel rcc-
ords were submitted for 73 individuals;
and 210 persons were interviewed. Re-

settlements,

 

MR. SL‘TIIERLAND is the director of
the NRA Recreation Personnel Service.

44

ferrals to positions numbered 625 and
4-9 new people registered with the Per-
sonnel Service. The types of positions
and the areas of placement have a great
deal in common with that reported
above for the month of August and in-
cluded executives, assistants, program
directors, specialists, and leaders in mu-
nicipal recreation, youth centers, settle-
ments, state services, welfare councils,
the U.S. Air Force, hospitals, hotels,
youth serving agencies, Police Athletic
League and the U.S.O. From the stand-
point of demand on the time of the per-
sonnel staff, there is some difference.
During August part of our headquar-
ters’ staff is away and there is not the
same pressure for attending conferences
and special meetings. Also, special proj-
ects and assignments and committee
work are not as pressing as they are
during the fall, winter and spring sea-
sons. (If you are not so well acquainted
with the services of the Recreation Per-
sonnel Service aspect of the Associa-
tion’s work, it is suggested~that you send
for our free leaflet describing these
services.)

We have been pleased to receive from
Temple B. J arrell, superintendent of
recreation in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida,
complimentary reaction to the Associ-
ation’s Personnel Standards in Recrea-
tion Leadership.1 We quote from his
recent letter: “You might be interested
to know that the personnel standards
which have been developed by the Na-
tional Recreation Association were pos-
itively outlined as being of tremendous
aid to the personnel agencies at the
Conference on Public Administration
held this week in Miami.” The meeting
was the annual convention conducted
by the Civil Service Assembly of the
U.S. and Canada.

Standards in general are receiving
more attention and it is encouraging,
for instancc, to see the National Coun-
cil for the Advancement of Hospital
Recreation drafting standards for rcc-

Ede;

reation personnel in hospitals. The
council is made up of the hospital sec-
tions of the American Recreation So-
ciety, the AAHPER and the National
Association of Recreation Therapy. The
latter is an affiliate member of the Na-
tional Recreation Association and the
association serves in a consultative ca-
pacity to the council.

In an effort to improve standards and
to advance professional education in
the south, the Southern Regional Edu-
cation Board will hold a meeting soon
to consider what to do about the find-
ings and recommendations contained
in the report of the two-year study of
leadership and training needs for the.
fourteen southern states. The NRA’s
district conferences will also make use
of the report which is just out in book
form.2 The sessions at these meetings
will deal specifically with standards and
problems revealed by the study.

The National Survey of Colleges and
Universities has been completed and the
report is now available.3 This gives a
general picture as to the present situa-
tion with reference to professional cur-
ricula for recreation, and deals with
such specific subjects as recruiting, en-
rollment and placement of students;
conditions affecting faculty, including
salaries and employment; facilities;
curricula and student field experience.
Incidentally, February graduates will
soon be ready for positions. The recrea-
tion cducators reading this will, I h0pe,
make sure that their own students are
registered with the National Recreation
Association. Also, former graduates
who are ready for promotion should
keep in touch with the Association’s
Recreation Personnel Service.

Dr. Henry 0. Dresser, professor of"

health, physical education, and recrea-
tion at Louisiana State University, an-
nounced recently that the university will
soon establish an undergraduate minor
in recreation. Louisiana State’s gradu-
ate school already offers an MS. in rec-
reation. Now, however, undergraduates
majoring in physical education will be
able to minor in recreation. Students
majoring in dramatics, elementary edu-
cation, or certain arts and sciences will
also be offered the Opportunity to minor
in recreation. Included will be a field
course in which students will get practi-
cal experience working with the intra-
mural department of the university, the
Baton Rouge Recreation and Park Com-
mission, and will also do some hospital
recreation work.

Oregon State College in Corvallis
now has thirty recreation majors. Two
of the field work students have been ap-
prenticed to the local hospital and are
working directly with the patients. The
extension service of Oregon State under
the direction of Jessalee Mallalieu is
carrying on a training program for
leaders in crafts in the rural areas. Met-
al tOoling proved to be the most popular
course. Leadership training will also be
given in home recreation, game leader-
ship and square dancing.

The University of Minnesota offers a
number of correspondence courses in
recreation already programmed as far
ahead as 1956. Included in these are
the “Social Aspects of Leisure” and the
“Operation of Recreation Centers” un-
der Dr. Gerald B. Fitzgerald. The
“Nature and Function of Play” is a
fundamental background course for
either recreation or physical education
and is directed by Herschel R. Giles.
The “Orientation to Recreation in Hos-
pitals” course, under Fred Chapman,
examines the introductory principles of
hospital recreation; the philosophy and
purposes of hospital recreation as well
as the program content is highlighted.

Michigan State College in East Lans-
ing is now giving evening courses in
conservation under the department of
land and water conservation. Included
in the program are courses in conserva-
tion of natural resources, special con-
servation problems, conservation edu-
cation, and water pollution conservation

law, the last given by Dr. F. C. Booth,
assistant attorney general of the State
of Michigan, who has represented the
state Water Resources Commission in
many court cases.

MacMurray College in Jacksonville,
Illinois, now offers two new programs
for teachers of exceptional children and
recreation leaders for the handicapped.
These programs, developed under a
$34,000 grant from the Field Founda-
tion of Chicago, will be carried on with
the cooperation of the Illinois School
for the Deaf, the Illinois School for the
Blind, and the Illinois State Hospital,
all located in Jacksonville. The new
program embraces an extensive course
of training for teachers of deaf children.
Another phase of the program will train
recreation leaders for children handi-
capped in sight, hearing, or learning
ability. It will be possible for students
to specialize either in recreational mu-
sic, recreational dramatics, or recrea-
tional games, dance, and social activi-
ties. Graduates in this field will be
qualified as recreation workers in hos-
pitals, institutions, and public and priv-
ate schools for exceptional children.

The McGill Winter Carnival will pre-
sent its seventh edition February 17-19
at McCill University, Montreal. The
carnival, at one time confined to the
university itself, has branched out to
the extent that the city of Montreal con-
siders it a highlight of its winter sea-
son and contributes financially to its
support. Among this year’s activities
will be an international ski meet, an ice
show, ice hockey matches, and an ath-
letic afternoon including a swimming
contest, synchronized swimming dem-
onstration, basketball, floor hockey, and
an inter-collegiate squash match.

Grove City College, Grove City, Penn-
sylvania is proud of its new recreation
building used for sports, recreation,

lures, and try them under all conditions
and rate them according to their per-
formance. When a bait gets the club
seal of approval it will be sent to the
membership some time during the year.

month—with bonus baits at different
times during the subscription year.

Effective Leadership in Human
Relations

Henry Clay Lindgren, Hermitage
House, Inc., 8 West 13th Street, New
York 13. Pp. 287. $3.50.

This is a very readable book and one
which might be classified as “popular
psychology.” Although considerable
discussion is centered around hostility,
the author is entirely constructive and
positive in his approach. He deals with
the sources and types of hostility and
eXplains how it is eXpressed. The pat-
terns of behavior are described and
many illustrations are provided.

Four types of leadership are defined
and he brings out quite clearly the fact
that we are going through a transition
period and are changing over from the
old paternalistic type of leadership to
the newer democratic approach. He
calls attention to the differences between
the dynamic and the administrative
types of leadership and identifies ele-
ments which make the leader different
from other people. He stresses the im-
portance of communication and the
sharing of power, authority, and re-
sponsibility with others as a means of
developing and strengthening leaders.
The book should be a helpful guide to
those working with groups and organi-
zations as well as to those who are train-
ing for, or who find themselves in, posi-
tions of leadership—W. C. Sutherland,
Director, Recreation Personnel Service,
National Recreation Association.

Teaching Adults

Malcolm S. Knowles. Association
Press, 291 Broadway, New York 7. Pp.
71. $1.00.*

This is a two-chapter excerpt in pam-
phlet form, of Mr. Knowles’ full-length
book, Informal Adult Education, which
was published in 1950. It provides, in
inexpensive form, a presentation of
guiding principles and techniques for
members of planning committees, lay
leaders, and teachers of informal
courses. For recreation leaders who de-
sire to help groups in setting up such
courses, it should prove helpful indeed.
The second half, in particular, which in-
cludes an explanation of informal
courses and their role in an organiza-
tion, the organization of a program, de-

Exploring Our National Parks and
Monuments (Fourth Edition)

Devereux Butcher. Houghton-Mifiiin

Company, 2 Park Street, Boston 7. Pp.
288. $34.50*

Another beautiful, revised edition of
this always interesting book has been
off-the-press since September. Since
publication of 'the last edition in 1951
the author, Devereux Butcher, has trav-
eled the country, literally from border
to border—visiting national parks, na-
ture monuments, and so on—taking
pictures for this book.

Sixteen pages are in color, and 280
striking halftone illustrations are in-
cluded. Maps show the location of all
areas described, and the narrative tells
about road and trail trips to world-
famous beauty spots and scenic won-
ders. This is an invaluable book for all
persons who are planning to visit or
have visited these places and for the
wilderness enthusiast, nature-lover—
and all who enjoy the out-of-doors.

Working With the Handicapped

Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., 155 East
44th Street, New York 17. Pp. 127.
3.75. -

This paperbound booklet is a leader’s
guide. It is designed to give a summary
of special information needed by any
adult working with special problem
children. While geared, of course, _to
the Girl Scout program, it is a valuable
contribution in a field sadly lacking in
practical material, and should be very
helpful to other organizations and rec-
reation departments who are becoming
more and more aware of their responsi-

bilities to those youngsters who, be“

cause of various handicaps, do not fit
into the normal program.
A novel presentation of various types

—is made by giving the point of view
of a specialist or doctor in each field.

A listing of non-government agen-
cies, and a classified bibliography
testify to the thoroughness evident
throughout this guide.

GUIDE To UNDERWATER HUNTING,

Simon Codrington. John de Graff, Inc.,

64 West 23rd Street, New York 10. Pp.
80. $1.75.

The new interest in exploring the
wonders beneath the sea which has been
Sparked by the activities of the frog-
men in World War II and by the perfec-
tion of underwater equipment, and pho-
tography as well, is resulting in the
publication of a rash of books on this
fascinating subject. These three are
among the latest. The first, by a com-
mander of the Undersea Research
Group of the French Navy, is an under-
sea adventure, telling of the experiences
and explorations of some of the under-
water pioneers. It is illustrated with
beautiful photographs in color as well
as in black and white. The second is a
book for boys, telling the story of a
youngster who is taught underwater
swimming tricks by a navy frogman.
An expert in underwater hunting has
written the last as a guide to newcom-
ers to this field. He discusses equipment
and its use, hunting technique, some of
the fish—such as sharks—wwhich might
be termed the “terrors of the deep.”

 name was Phoebe Mozee and she

was born in Darke County, Ohio, in

1860, and she could shoot the head 0H a

running quail when she wastwelve years old.

Once, at the invitation of Kaiser Wil-
helm ll of Germany, she knocked the ashes
oil' a cigaret he was holding in his mouth.

When she out-shot the great exhibition
marksman, Frank Butler, he fell in love
with her and married her and they were
ideally happy together for the rest of their
long lives.

She could handle a rifle or a six-gun
with an artistry unsurpassed by that of any
human being before her time or, probably,
since. And when she appeared with Sitting
Bull and other notables in Colonel Cody’s
Wild West Show, she thrilled your father
and mother—not as Phoebe Anne Oakley
Mozee but as “Little Sure Shot,” the im-
mortal Annie Oakley.

Annie Oakley, the poor back-country
orphan girl who made her way to world-
wide fame, was the very spirit of personal
independence. That spirit is just as much
