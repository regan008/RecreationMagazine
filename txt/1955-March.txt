ment investment, more physical

The world has a false picture of
America. Foreigners see us—and in
this they are correct—as the most high-
ly developed and advanced technologi-
cal society. We are a country of mass
production, achieved by the greatest di-
vision of labor, in which each worker
is confined to a single process. Num-
erous European writers depict every
American as a cog or an expert, as a
mechanical man. The individual, they
ruminate, is absorbed in the work pro-
cess.

The perfection of technology, they
therefore argue, leads to a centralized
collectivist society since it is impossible
to “put the clock back” to a simpler,
more individualistic age. I should like
to offer a counterthesis: that in America
technology is leading, and will increas-
ingly lead to more decentralization,
greater self-sufficiency of the family
unit, and that the future promises to he
basically and spiritually more like the
world of our grandparents, that the
American is rapidly recovering his ama-
teur status in life as a whole, and that
the very gadgets that European intel-
lectuals despise are encouraging the res-
toration of a more whole person, who
puts to use manifold gifts and ingenui-
ties.

When Emerson wrote, a twelve-hour
day and six-day week were usual. Man
was absorbed in his subdivided function
during all his waking hours. Today
technology enables him to produce and
earn several times as much in half the
time.

What do Americans do with the time
that technological deve10pment has

handed back to them?

In the conventional picture they sit
at television sets, go to movies, play
canasta, and that is about all. In reali-
ty, although they do all these things,
they also paint pictures, make inven-
tions, decorate and even partially build
their own houses, landscape gardens,
make their own clothes. The scholar
prides himself as a cook; the garment
worker attends art classes; the physi-
cian fiddles in an amateur orchestra;
the advertising executive makes the
furniture for his children’s playroom.
Technology has not only given him time
to do so, but every day in the week it is
furnishing him with new tools to help
him work for himself.

Half of all the gadget patents issued
in this country go to basement and gar-
age “inventors” whose paid work is un-
related to invention or even to science.
The American genius has never been
confined within scientific laboratories.

If Sunday painters rarely produce
distinguished works of art, some occa-
sionally do —- in America as well as
in France. They don’t paint, however,
for money or for fame, but as an out-
let for creative energy. Sometimes they
are discovered by critics, dealers or mu-
seum directors, as Grandma Moses was
discovered, to charm two continents.
The President of the United States loves
to cook, and is, by all accounts, very
expert at it. And I know businessmen,
writers, artists, journalists and univer-
sity presidents who would rather dis-
cuss the Gourmet Cookbook than their
own professions.

The professional cook, as a household
domestic, has all but vanished, but
American cookery has not thereby de-
clined. Women who “never boiled an
egg,” and “career” women at that, whip
up four-course meals with professional
attention to balance and taste in the
menu.

The American home has again be-
come a great work center for self-im-
pelled persons, working for their own
pleasure and profit.

Check on the sales of the mail-order
houses, who advertise pages of power-
driven tools for carpentry. Last year,
from such houses and other firms,
$100,000,000 worth of such tools were
sold to homeowners who are not car-
penters and who spent upwards of three
billion dollars for materials to be self-
fabricated.

N 0 country produces by virtue of di-
vision of labor as comely well-cut cloth-
ing as cheaply as does America. But
in no other country is there as much
home dressmaking! The Singer Sewing
Machine Company recently reported
that today 30,000,000 American women
make some, at least, of their own and
their children’s clothes. Last year home
dressmakers bought over half a billion
dollars’ worth of yard goods, $51,000,-
000 worth of notions and novelties, and
kept 32,000,000 sewing machines hum-
ming. In 1950, the last year for which
figures are available, they bought 200,-
000,000 dress patterns, more than there
are people in the United States!

“Do it yourself!” Last year paint
firms sold a billion and a half dollars
worth of their products; sixty-five per
cent of this was put on walls by house-
wives or their husbands—at a fifth of
the cost of hiring someone to do it. Did
they do a good job? Certainly. The
new paints with a liquid-rubber base,
together with rollers and new-type
brushes, are almost foolproof for the
applier.

Check on the sales of work clothes.

Last year clothing manufacturers pro-

duced 173,000,000 work pants, overalls
and work shirts. Who wears them? The
executive, the diplomat, the editor, the
salesman. Doing what? Among other

RECREATION

l

things, trimming hedges, potting and

setting out seedlings a n d p r u n i n g

shrubs in eighteen and a half million
gardenerless home gardens -— and with
ingenious tools designed by technology
for amateurs.

The farmer used to sell his fatted
calves, his buck lambs, his broilers and
his fowl on the wholesale markets and
then find himself unable to afford to
buy meat back at retail. Today the
farmer takes out enough to feed his fam-
ily for a whole season, and puts it into
his freezer or rented locker. Farm fam-
ilies are eating today better than they
ever did, at less cost because of a sim-
ple invention—the freezer.

Thus, the net effect of the division of
labor and the enormous efficiency re-
sulting from it is to return man to him-
self and to his home, and increase, not
diminish, his self-sufficiency and range

of activities.

The American refuses, now as always,
to be confined to one job, one process.
Actually, I think our greatest satisfac-
tions are derived from the things that
we are not “supposed” to do. Praise me
for an article that I have written and I
shall be pleased, because I have never
written one that wholly satisfied my-
self. But admire the dainty blanket
covers on my guest-room beds; say you
never ate a better Bavarian cream;
praise the flowers that grew from seed
to seedlings to great clumps from win-
dow sill to garden; ask me for my recipe
for puff paste—that will make me blush
with pleasure. That will make me real-
ize that I am not a “writer,” but a wom-
an who writes, writes for pleasure,
writes for a living, but is not a writing
machine. I laugh at my husband, who,
when a 1critic admires a painting he has

Editorial

made, is likely to add, “But I made the
frame,” the painting being the profes-
sional thing that he knows he knows
how to do, the frame being the hobby
executed by an amateur craftsman.
Recreation is nothing but a change of
work—an occupation for the hands by
those who live by their brains, or for
the brains by those who live by their
hands, and we shall yet, I am sure, cre-
ate that whole society of whole men
which Emerson envisioned. And if we
accomplish this, at least in large meas-
ure, even communism will one day stop
in its tracks and take another look
around. Man was not meant to live in
an anthill, even with the best plumbing.

 

Recreation and the Ultimates

In St. Louis, last fall, the National Recreation Congress
dealt with ultimates—character, spirit, freedom, and the
creative life, citizenship, victory, democracy, brotherhood
—as they are related to recreation. And the relationship
Was crystal clear. All that we hold dear in our better mo-
ments was marshaled before us by leaders qualified to speak
with assurance. Whatever roads lie ahead for the recreation
movement there was a Vantage point! From it we all saw
the future beckoning. To it we all can turn when reassurance
is needed.

And in the turning there will again rise before us, like
flashing challenges, the personal statement of Gaylord Don-
nelley, one of America’s ablest young business statesmen,
as to recreation’s part in personal, business, and community
life; the simple expression of faith of Soichi Saito, one of
Asia’s spiritual leaders and a representative of a former
enemy nation, as to the reconciling and unifying influence
of recreation between nations; the unforgettable analysis
of C. D. Jackson, who, because of a remarkable experience
and awareness of what moves people and nations in war and
peace, clearly listed recreation as a basic component of the
conviction necessary to victory in the present world strug-
gle; to the overwhelming impact of the message of Dr. James
5W. Clarke, whose rare eloquence literally lifted the entire
Congress to a plane of builders of the cathedral and hand-
maidens of God.

The pages in those proceedings will recall for you many
other messages and many other aspects of the Congress. We
commend them to you for reading and rereading. The work-
shops, the discussion groups, the demonstrations were of
a high order. The committee meetings, the ideas, the tech-

niques, the professional problems—0n all of these progress-

MARCH 1955

was made and great appreciation has been expressed.

It is always satisfying when the housekeeping chores of
administrative leadership meet with favor, and we gladly
pay tribute to the contribution of hundreds of persons who
shared in the conduct of the Congress. But the thing of
which we can be proud—the thing that gives meaning to the
dedication that has gone into the building of the recreation
movement—is that the ultimates were recognized, dealt with,
and appreciated at the St. Louis Congress.

May those of you who were at St. Louis continue to find
satisfaction from recalling, with the help of those pages, the
spirit of that week. For all, this book is full of information
on the giant strides of the recreation movement and the basic
beliefs which have sparked progress.

The above is essentially the foreword for the Proceedings
of the 37th National Recreation Congress. We penned it to
introduce the written record of what transpired in St. Louis,
to focus our minds on the eternal values to which the Con-
gress contributed. But in a very real sense the ultimates so
unerringly sketched for us there were not for St. Louis alone,
and that is why we refer to them again at this time.

In great cities teeming with millions of people hungry for
life, in drab small towns, in lonely rural areas—~here, and
in the undeveloped lands of the earth; in churches, schools,
hospitals, homes and industries; in parks, playgrounds and
community centers, wherever gifted workers are guiding
people to a richer, more meaningful life through recreation
——there the ultimates are being eXperienced.

As we start our labors in 1955 we can lift our heads as
high as our hearts. For recreation leaders and all who sup-
port them are dealing with ultimates.—T. E. RIVERS, Sec-
retdry of the National Recreation Congress. '

Intangible Values
Sirs:

This is to congratulate you on the
article by Sigurd F. Olson in the J anu-
ary number of RECREATION. This article
to me is an interpretation of what nature
and wholesome living can mean to real
pe0ple and could mean to more pe0ple
if we had more models to successfully
point the way. I would like to meet the
writer of this article; he would make a
grand companion.

Give us more articles interpretative
of our objectives written in such an in»
spiring manner. The little tot on the
front cover of that magazine is going to
need a place where such ideas prevail
when she grows up.

GRANT D. BRANDON, 818 State Street,
Lancaster, Pennsylvania

“If You Have a Good Ear . . .”

Sirs:

An article in your January issue en-
titled, “Music Comes to Main Street,”
by H. W. Heinsheimer, pleased me be-
yond words. The comment described by
Mr. Heinsheimer about a young com-
poser and music teacher, Morton S. Cit-
ron, who has a studio in Carnegie Hall,
reminds me of an old Chinese saying,
“A tutor who knows to suggest instead
of pouring the instruction into the ears
of his pupil is the best teacher of all.”

When I first came to see Mr. Citron,
my inferiority complex was deepened to
the core and the thought that I had that
no one would be able to change my mo-
notonous style of piano playing was in-

  
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

glorious. But it was Mr. Citron who
convinced and said to me one day, “If
you have a good ear for music and the
will to do it, there is nothing impos-
sible.” I followed his sound advice and
method, and at the same time I listened
very carefully to his many ways of
euphonizing a melody. Today, after
studying with him for less than two
months, my technique of syncopating
any melody has beautified to a real
sense of music.

A Master Social Calendar

Sirs:

Your very excellent article, “Taking
Stock” in your January issue, was a
grand ob on a recreation inventory. In
fact, your “Idea of the Month” is a gem. I

Five years ago the Eastchester Rec~ .
reation Commission put a Town Master
Social Calendar into business. Every
organization in the town was asked to
appoint a social recreation chairman

and forward the name to the Commis-
sion. At the same time, the organiza-
tion was asked to forward their social
calendar of the year also. Alllactivities
were compiled on a master calendar.
Whenever any organization wanted to
run an additibnal social activity they
would call the recreation office for
clearance.

The local newspaper features our cal-
endar in a prominent part of the paper.

The calendar works two ways. We
have a list of people to whom we send
it—and it is read at all meetings in
town. Organizations in the town are no
longer bucking each other with their
social affairs.

At each meeting in town you will
often hear, “Call the Eastchester recre-
ation office for clearance.” A very profit-
able bit of public relations at no cost.

VINCENT D. BELLEW, Director, East-

From Sweden

Sirs:

My experiences from the very nice
round-trip [in the United States] in
1948 have been most helpful for my job.
As a few examples, shuflieboard, box-
hockey and bingo have been introduced
here and have become very p0pular.
Jacks are still planned. They are not
made here and I have given samples to
at least four firms without success as
yet; but I am still trying and hope for
a solution.

RECREATION magazine is indeed ex-
tremely good and the practical hints on
different subjects we have made use of
many, many times. Just now, we have
in-service training in table games both
old, as Mah Jong and Backgammon, and
new. So, of course, Kalah and Go from
the October RECREATION will be taught.
By the way, in-service training was the
first thing I started on my return.

lwas very glad to receive the National
Recreation Association report on Inter-
national Recreation Services sent to me

last spring by Mr. Rivers. The Swedish
playground movement is still develop-
ing as I hope it will always be. I am just
on my way to Gothenburg to study the
result of a Scandinavian playground
competition and to discuss the starting
of a Swedish playground association
with a first conference in 1955. The next
step will be a Scandinavian association
and later on perhaps a European one.

There is a great interest in supervised
playgrounds in many countries in
Europe, but so far there is not very
much done except in Denmark, Finland,
Holland and Sweden. England is just
starting but the interested persons have
a great job in convincing people of the
importance of trained leaders. Infor-
mation about other countries I have
obtained from visitors who have come
to Stockholm both through the U.N. and
privately and for an International Con-
ference on Open Air Education in
Zurich last year.

Last June the U.N. Technical Assist-

ance Office in Geneva sent me to Finland
for ten days to lecture about play-
grounds. Helsinki already has quite a
good program and in the other big cit-
ies people are very interested. It is so
interesting to see how similar the prob-
lems are and how differently they can
be solved according to customs and na-
tional distinctions. On this trip our new
filmstrip was most useful.

A very strong wish of mine is to get
the opportunity to make another visit to
the United States and, preferably, to a
national recreation congress. Just now
I cannot see any possibility of this, but
I do hope to find some way to realize it
sometime.

tendent of Playgrounds and Recrea-

INDUSTRIAL RECREATHDN

A Guide to Its Organization and Administration
By

JACKSON M. ANDERSON

American Association for Health, Physical Education,
and Recreation

IN PRESS

 

It is intended as a practical guide to industrial recreation
directors in administering employee recreation programs
and also for those studying the organization and adminis-
tration of such a program. It is, in addition, an analysis of
the employee recreation program with relation to the vari-
ous social problems faced by modern industry and to the
total community recreation program. Specific recommen-
dations—principles, methods, and techniques— on plan-
ning and initiating a program are thoroughly discussed.
Program activities, program leadership, financing the pro-
gram, facilities and equipment, publicity and public rela-
tions, etc., are soundly treated in this practical and compre-
Ilensive report on industrial recreation. In addition, there
is a thorough discussion of the history of employee recrea-
tion and its benefits to industrial relations.

Many recreation departments and industries across the country hold an

annual hobby show. Some open it to certain age classifications or groups;
some make it a city-wide or company-wide affair. If you have missed the
boat so far, try one this year. See article, “Include Hobbies and Hobby
Shows in Your Program,” page 130; also “Hobbies Develop the Executive,”

on page 112.

Selecting a Hobby

The number of hobbies to choose
from seems endless, yet it is possible to
find printed materials on almost every
subject. Many government agencies
stand ready to help the hobbyist. For
instance, the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, Department of Interior, offers Fish-
ery Leaflet 315, Aquarium Construction
in the Home Workshop; Fishery Leaflet
4-3, Care of Aquarium Fishes; and Fish-
ery Leaflet 165, Some Aquarium Fishes.
The Rural ElectrificatiOn Administra-
tion, Department of Agriculture, tells
how-to-do in an eight-page pamphlet,
Leaflet Number 317, Electric Lamps
That You Can. Make or Modernize.
Write to the Superintendent of Docu-
ments, Government Printing Office,

Washington 25, D.C., for a list of other
government hobby publications.

Hobbies may bring in a small income
now and then; although, of course, if
pursued only for monetary reasons, the
activity ceases to be a hobby at all. This
is an important distinction which should
be watched. It is better to make things
for fun, and then, if you happen to sell
one or two, the personal satisfaction and
enjoyment a hobby offers will still be
there.

Hobbyist, Test Yourself

Here’s a test to determine if your hob-
by is a good one. Gordon Hendrickson
of the University of Cincinnati faculty
says a good hobby has eight character-
izations. It should involve a tangible
product that can be admired by others,
should fit the hobbyist’s age and cir-
cumstances, and should have a group of
devotees in whom can be found social
contacts, recognition, and acceptance.

Also, the hobby should be diHicult
enough to challenge the skill but not too

difiicult to prevent some success; it
should further and not interfere with
family life; it should not interfere with
one’s vocation; it should be the hobby-
ist’s servant and not master; and it
should have possibilities for growth and
continued interests throughout the

years—New York Post, January 21,
1953.

Hobby School

The Young Men’s Christian Associa-
tion in Seattle, Washington, is conduct-
ing a successful hobby school which
averages 2,500 class enrollments annu-
ally for the fall, winter, and spring quar-

ter. There, young husbands and wives
have gained mutual leisure-time inter-
ests which will last throughout life, and
family enrollment has been promoted.
Interesting among the many subjects
are courses such as: The Art of Travel-
ing; Ballroom Dancing for Teen-Agers;
Flower Arrangement; F old b o atin g
(Kayaks) ; Fly Fishing and Fly Tying;
Horseback Riding; The Art of Letter
Writing; Photo Tinting; Pleasure
Trips in Poetry; Oldtime Dancing; and,
of course, crafts, painting, photography
and sports are included.

Pursuit of Leisure

You and I are now on the greatest
“fun” buying spree of our entire his-
tory.

This year alone we’re spending close
to thirty-one billion dollars on leisure
activities alone—on amusements rang-
ing from hunting, fishing and golf to
pleasure reading, music and photogra-
phy.

This represents a thumping twelve
per cent of our total income after taxes;
it’s twice as much as we Spend on new
cars or household goods; it’s a record
high sum, of course. _

It’s a trend on which we can place no
limit for the simple reason that it has
no limit and every force behind it is
gaining power.

To the “inalienable rights” of “life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness,”
our generation has added the “pursuit
of leisure.” And it is typical of us that
we are pursuing leisure with boundless
energy.——Sylvia F. Porter, in her col-
umn, “Labor and Business,” New York

Post, December 9, 1954.

If you’ve never been to Denver, it is probably a city you’ve
always wanted to visit. If you have ever been there, you
no doubt have been wanting to return. Denver’s clear air
and invigorating climate, a mile above sea level; Denver’s
spectacular setting, with the Rockies as its western horizon;
Denver’s people, friendly and informal; Denver’s spirit——
all of these and more make Denver an inviting city. We are
glad to be going to Denver this year for the 37th National
Recreation Congress, September 27 to October 1.

Denver and nearby Colorado Springs and the whole Colo-
rado Recreation Society are enthusiastic about entertaining
us; and they long ago began making plans for the occasion.
The national parks, so near to Denver, are tempting. Every-
body will, for instance, want to see the hugh outdoor theatre
in the Park of the Red Rocks, where rock formations pro-
vide natural acoustics, which seats 8,000 persons. J. Earl
(Curley) Schlupp’s article in this issue of RECREATION (see
page 108) will interest many. Others will want to see and
do some real mountain square dancing. There are more
than 12,000 square dancers in Denver—as if they were ever
still enough to be counted.

Denver potentialities for the Congress are high. We hope,
therefore, that as the Congress program develops you will
find you can’t possibly stay away from Denver in September.
Just to play safe hadn’t you better begin planning to attend
right now? Better to plan early than too late.

Congress a Cooperative Venture

Committees will help again this year in the planning of
many Congress meetings. Suggestions from planning com-
mittees and from individuals are always heavily relied upon.
Membership of several committees is already complete and

National Recreation Congress City
September 27—October 1, 1955

Because of its western inheritance and its feeling for liv-
ing out, not up, the people of Denver maintain adequate
backyards, so recreation actually begins at home. A visitor
quickly senses the pride and care given to both the land-
scaping and the utility of grounds around Denver homes.

This, of course, ties in with the development of Denver’s
parks. Anyone familiar with recreation organization would
realize that the need for tot lots is virtually nil. One would
also realize that here the family lives as a unit and hies to
the hills or nearest large park and enjoys the good life.

As a matter of fact, a visit from a distant cousin is reason
enough for a Denverite to “close up shop,” call the family,
and take the visitor through our parks and into the more
than 15,000 acres of city-owned mountain parks. With an
inheritance like this, it has been natural to design _a man-
agement program for recreation which gives a maximum of
service with a minimum of interference or regimentation.

As early as 1911, the Denver public schools initiated after-
school and summer supervision for recreation. Consequent-
ly, the board of education is well aware of the need for a
physical set-up other than that employed for a formal curric-
ulum, and it has used considerable wisdom in the selection of
sites, design of buildings, and provision of adequate areas.
The three major high schools and a large junior high school,
for instance, adjoin Denver’s larger parks, bringing edu-
cation and park sites into proximity for use of both areas.

As Denver’s park system was attracting thousands of users
and many existing agencies were developing youth and
adult activity programs, it was determined that central man-
agement for the coordinated promotion and development of
recreation was necessary. In 1943, the municipality pro-
vided a budget for the recreation department as an agency
under the mayor. To date this agency has grown to a com-
plement of 47 year-round full-time workers, and from 90
to 180 part-time" workers.

At the basic conception of recreation management in Den-
ver, it was agreed that the first function was service; the
second, coordination and c00peration; and the third, vita-
lizing and developing proper habits in public activities. Also
important were the redesigning of existing facilities for mod-
ern use and the developing of workable long-range plans
to satisfy the needs of a growing city for future use. Main-

tenance and construction for recreation were to remain a
function of the parks division which was equipped to expand
such equipment and service. This is an effective community
plan that achieves almost maximum use of existing facilities
and citizen participation in decisions affecting them.

Community Plan

A unique part of Denver’s recreation plan is the com-
mittee, known as the City-School Coordinating Committee
on Recreation, appointed by the mayor. It is composed of
six members, and a paid chairman who is a professionally
prepared person. Three of the members are nominated by
the superintendent of schools and the board of education.
The committee’s present members illustrate its representa-
tion: the president of the city and county Parent-Teacher
Association; the principal of one of the large high schools;
a member of the board of education; the director of plan-
ning for the City and County of Denver; the chairman of
the city council recreation committee; and the assistant man-
ager of improvements and parks in charge of parks and rec-
reation. The chairman is the director of health education
and recreation for Denver public schools.

One of the prime functions of the coordinating committee
is to preserve the autonomy of expenditures for recreation
by the board of education and by the city. There must be
constant review of both programs to prevent duplication of
service, duplication of plans and facilities, duplication of
recruitment and training of employees, to mcntion three, all
of which could lead to wasteful use of tax dollars.

Out of this coordinated planning committee has come a
widely diversified program for all ages, with public interpre-
tation and understanding of intent. The existing Opportuni-
ty School and its multiple extension services to adults fitted
into the planning. Services were distributed to neighbor-
hood schools and municipal structures.

The great potential existing in the development of the
neighborhood schools as a community plant will be realized
as a result of the recent $30,000,000 bond issue voted for
new school buildings and‘ sites. The acquisition of park and
recreation land adjoining these school sites has real mean-
ing for Denver’s future growth.

In 1947 the citizens of Denver voted a $1,000,000 bond

issue for recreation improvements, and visitors to the Na-
tional Recreation Congress this September .will View several
of these completed projects. One of particular note is a
twelve-acre park which combines the most recent features
of recreation and park planning now in use and demon-
strates the meeting of utility and beauty while providing
wide variety of both formal recreation activities and mul-
tiple choice informal opportunities.

Denver, because of its unique position as the largest city
in Colorado, and because of its rapidly developing role as
an air terminal, gravely accepts its responsibilities for lead-
ership in the Midwest. It borrows from the happy experi-
ences in the East, and cautiously observes the rapidity of
growth in the West, in order that it may seek out the best
ingredients for sound recreation management. And so, in
its continual search for efficient organization and manage-

MARCH 1955

ment, in the past year Denver merged the parks operation
—which heretofore, by charter, had been a part of the im-
provements and parks department—with the recreation de-
partment under,single management. This was effected by
an executive order of the mayor. If successful, a referendum
to the citizens will be offered creating, by charter reform, a
parks and recreation department.

It is hoped that those attending the National Recreation
Association Congress will find Denver an on-the-spot case-
study for discussion of many nationwide problems such as:

1. City-school cooperation.

2. Combined management of parks and recreation.

3. Community organization for maximum cooperation of
national and local recreation agencies other than public.

4. Long-range planning and its effect on parks and rec-
reation development.

5. The design and development of formal park areas and
its relationship to the multiple-use informal area.

6. The neighborhood plan of administration versus the
building-centered activity. '

Certainly we, in Denver, hope to gather, during the Con-
gress, information regarding the latest nationwide develop-
ments and hope to offer something to the visitor in return.

To those of you driving to Denver, national parks and
our mountain beauty are encountered ust twelve miles from
our city. We recommend, either before or after the confer-
ence, a visit to the natural scenic spots that are Colorado’s.*

If you are coming by train, your ticket to Denver can be
arranged to include Colorado Springs without additional
cost, and there you will find a mountain playground in the
Pike’s Peakarea.

It would be an oversight if we did not close by saying that
lack of space prohibits mentioning Theater of the Red Rocks
and its multiple summer use by the Denver Symphony and
other related organizations; but we will plan an activity
at the Congress to take you there and present to you a bit
of the West in a program. And we haven’t mentioned our
fine bluegrass golf courses on which we hope you will play.

ver will appear in the September 1955 issue of RECREATION. Hold up

Stratford’s

Shakespearean

Festival

Since the writing of this story in the spring of 1953, the Stratford Festival has seen two seasons of rous-
ing success, received wide acclaim and is now the subject of a newly published book, Twice Have the Trum-
pets Sounded, by Tyrone Guthrie, Robertson Davies and Grant Macdonald, Clarke, Irwin & Company,
Toronto, Canada. It is most interesting to read of their early struggles in the light of these developments.

STRATFORD, ONTARIO, APRIL 1953—
More willingly than not, most of Strat-
ford’s 19,000 residents are taking part
in the coming Shakespeare Festival.
Careful investigation shows that the
only major factor which keeps the city
from unanimously giving whole-hearted
support to the scheduled five-week run
of two Shakespeare plays is one word:
culture. The citizenry in some cases
has adepted an almost negative attitude
toward this word and anything pertain-
ing to it.

Although the Stratford Shakespear-
ean Festival, which grew from an idea
to concrete reality only two years ago,
is aimed largely at furthering culture,
a few citizens have been aware, how-
ever, that the presentations will further
community spirit, perspective, and co-
hesion. In addition, the effect on Can-
ada as a whole may be profound. Al-
ready a smaller center in the county of
Perth is planning a Summer festival of
dramatic works, not necessarily Shake-
spearean.

The start of it all was a local boy’s
dream -— Tom Patterson’s vision of a
Shakespearean Festival on Avon, here
in Ontario. He came back from England
after the war more completely sold on
the idea than ever, having visited the
original Stratford-on-Avon. Not being
able to convince anyone at the time, he
joined the editorial staff of Civic Ad-

ministration magazine. Attending a

mayors’ meeting in Winnipeg, he met
Stratford’s Mayor Dave Simpson and
talked over his dream.

The mayor liked the idea and Tom
presented it to the city council. They
also liked it and sent him to New York
to see Laurence Olivier about partici-
pating in the festival. Unfortunately,
Olivier was under contract and could
not come. Tom then set out for Eng-
land and made his contacts there. Dr.
Tyrone Guthrie, well-known director,
came back to look the situation over.
The chamber of commerce stepped into
the picture, a committee was formed
and out of all this the ShakeSpearean
Festival Foundation was born.

So, like it or not, ready or not, for
good or for bad, the festival is coming,
and it is already beginning to be felt in
the Dominion.

To begin with, Stratford has begun a
beautification program. Citizens who
for many years have idly eyed their un-
painted steps, sagging fences, untrim-
med hedges each spring, for some rea-
son, have “gotten around to that job at
last.” There was no direct movement
leading up to this. The attitude of the
populace might be: “If the festival is
coming, I want my place looking clean
and fresh.”

Paint is brightening the beautiful
homes of this city, and lawns, taking on
their springtime green, are being care-
fully trimmed and tended. The city
parks department is engaged in an un-
usual llurry of activity. The effect is
widespread, and it is wholesome.

Businessmen of the community al-
ready have recognized the importance
of an inHux of festival visitors. Singly,
or as a result of businessmen’s meet-
ings, they have taken pains to improve
their stocks and beautify their stores.

The possibility of bringing native cul-
ture into the foreground, even before
the festival can have any real effect on
fostering a n ative Canadian drama
form, has not been neglected. Plans for
exhibiting Canadiana are in the mak-
ing. Canadiana includes works of 11a-
tive sculptors, painters, jewelry makers,
perhaps featuring clothing and blankets
—things truly Canadian. An exhibition
will bring these things together for the
benefit of visitors from other lands, and,

possibly most important, for Canadians.

The effect of the festival on culture
already has been indicated. It is to be
hoped that the desire to experiment in
drama will become contagious, until all
parts of this land strike out on their
own, not only in drama or cultural
fields, but in all fields of human endeav-
or. Another effect to be hoped for in
this community might be to see among
the anti-culturists, at least a toleration
of some form of cultural activity. This
cannot be forced, but if given a chance
to be spectators, some people may be
able to evaluate it, and perhaps like it.

Aside from those individuals merely
opposed to the idea of “higher things,”
however, are those idealists who feel
that a scheme developed by a native of
this city can make little or no contribu-
tion to its actual culture. Some think,
too, that such a project—particularly on
such a large scale—will deter amateurs
from attempting anything similar here,
or that the idealistic aims for the festival
will deteriorate under the weight of ma-
terialism. They point out that the pro-
ject will use little Canadian talent. Most
agree, nevertheless, that a try, at least,
will not be amiss.

The principals will be Alec Guinness,
well known English stage, TV, and mov-
ie star, and the foremost director in the
.1. Arthur Rank organization, Tyrone
Guthrie, in the productions, Richard I I I
and A ll’s Well That Ends Well.

The plays will be presented in a mod-
ern adaptation of the Elizabethan the-
atre, on a specially-designed stage re-
-creating the conditions under which
Shakespeare’s plays were presented in
his own day.

The aims of the festival itself have
been set forth by the festival committee.

MARCH 1955

 
   

.. .E:

‘i‘ri ..._

Without elaboration, their nine objec-
tives are:

1. To promote interest in, and the study of,
the arts generally and literature, drama, and
music in particular.

2. To advance knowledge and appreciation
of, and to stimulate interest in, Shakespearean
culture and tradition by theatrical perform-

ances and otherwise.
3. To provide facilities for education and

instruction in the arts of the theatre.

4. To provide improved opportunities for
Canadian artistic talent.

5. To advance the deve10pment of the arts
of the theatre in Canada.

6. For the purposes aforesaid to acquire
and construct such property as may be re-

quired. _
7. To conduct an annual Shakespearean

Festival at Stratford, Canada.

8. To collect money by way of donations, or
otherwise to accept gifts, legacies, devises and
bequests, and to hold, invest, expend or deal
with the same in furtherance of the objects of

the corporation.
9. To do all such other things as are inci-

dental or conducive to the attainment of the
above objects.

The Stratford Recreation Department
must help in making visitors to the festi-
val feel at home, in an environment in
which they can become acquainted with
real Canadian things, so they may carry
away favorable impressions and ideas.
Among the things this department may
do are: the organization of sunset sing-
songs in the city’s beautiful park system
on the River Avon; the provision of a
free guide service to conduct visitors on
tours of the city’s interesting points;
and the development of an exhibition of
Canadiana.

Stratford on Avon boasts of one of
the prettiest park systems and the friend-
liest community in Ontario. A festival
of Shakespearean plays in this setting is
bound to be a success.

What the critics said:

Henry Grunwald, Time magazine—
“A minor theatrical miracle . . . . Sel-
dom have so many Shakespeare lovers
owed so much to so few.”

A. W. House, Industrial Canada—
“The Stratford Shakespearean Festival
is a miraculous achievement.”

San Francisco Chronicle—“A roar-
ing theatrical success that can make
Broadway rub its commercial eyes.”

Walter Kerr, New York Herald Trib-

une—“Theatrical coup of the season.”

The Right Honourable Louis St. Lau-

rent, Prime Minister of Canada—“It is
something that redounds to the credit of
the whole Canadian people.”

Never before in the history of Canada
has such a spotlight of publicity been
turned on any single event.

The 1954 Festival, which drew 125,-
115 spectators, was directed by Tyrone
Guthrie and Cecil Clarke, and pre-
sented, among other distinguished the-
atre people, James Mason and Frances
Hyland, in Measure for Measure, Tam-
ing of the Shrew and Oedipus Rex.

Also in the summer of 1954 the
board of governors of the Stratford
Shakespearean Festival, as a first step in
establishing a theatre school with
courses in acting, theatrical production,
and design in connection with the festi-
val, introduced a short drama course to
stimulate and interest students in the
theatre as a whole.

Thus this story achieves a triumphant
conclusion, accomplished by a small
city of 19,000, through faith, energy
and imagination, and —- not least ——-
through generous support from busi-
ness and industry.

WHY . . .

A hobby enables you to be more ejfec-
tive in the job that is the source of your

daily bread:

) A hobby furnishes you with addition-
al knowledge that opens those new vis-
tas which are a part of the self-broaden-
ing process.

} A hobby develops another source of
self-confidence, and of reserve skills on
which to fall back during a time of crisis
or indecision.

) A hobby adds another facet to your
life that makes you more interesting to
others, that reenforces your personality
and causes you to be a better compan-
ion, friend, and boss.

) A hobby introduces you to more peo-
ple. The wider your circle of acquaint-
ances, the greater the chance to improve
your insight and handling of the varia-
tions in personalities.

) A hobby is another motivation in
your private life to “be up and doing,”
to take you out of yourself, to seek the
change that rests, to make life more tol-
erable—in short, to help you fulfill that
essential prerequisite to any success,
sound mental health, and emotional sta-
bility.

} A hobby requires clear thinking;
gives one practice in the working out of
a problem.

For the busy man who thinks hob-
bies are for the idle: An analysis

of why and how to have one.

obvious. From the tombstones of two
unknowns:

I was well, but trying to be better, I
am here; and,

Here lies a person who grew old, and
died in self-neglect.

HOW...

A hobby can develop from a mere killer
of idle time into a challenging, enjoya-
ble avocation:

There are two sorts of hobbies: those
that fill leisure hours pleasantly, even
profitably —— the theater, golf, walking
—and those that occupy a grandstand
seat in a man’s life.

It is possible to claim many hobbies
in the first group as your own. Any-
one can dally with a number of pas-
times quite easily. But when an activity
is so important it is a man’s second oc-
cupation upon which he feeds his mind
and sharpens his individuality, it usu-
ally is not lumped in with other diver-
sions.

Hobby-riding of this latter kind is
very purposeful as well as pleasant and
fun. It is an enduring activity, where-
as hobbies that are purely diversiOnal
often end under attic memorials of dis-
carded photographic equipment and
dust-covered canvases and brushes.

Let’s not kid ourselves. The purpose-
ful hobby is work; and it results from
a viewPoint that considers this work
worthwhile.

Between a Shutterbug whose para-
phernalia may end in the attic and Du
Pont’s president, Crawford H. Greene-

walt, whose photographs are well
known, lies a difference in vieWpoint
that is wide enough to be the Atlantic
Ocean. For Greenewalt, photography
has grown into a personal occupation to
which he puts his mind and makes pe-
culiarly his own by tackling it as only
a man with his technical training could.

Of course, a hobby, no matter how re-
warding and worth-while, should never '
supplant one’s real life work. A presi-
dent who wants to stay at the head of
his firm, or a man desiring to land some-
where in that vicinity, would certainly
be losing his perspective and humor if
he allows himself to become a nut over
some interest outside his business life.

But what turns a hobby into a chal-
lenging, yet fun-to-do activity for such
busy, highly intelligent men as Greene-
walt, and others like him?

One thing that turns the trick, as men-
tioned before, is viewpoint. Consider a
hobby from the angle of making a study
of it. Has it enough facets so the mind
is led down a number of trails and per-
sonal interest is constantly activated?
Will the hobby hold you, be enduring?

Fulfillment of these requirements de-
pends partly on the man, partly on the
activity itself. Take a simple illustra-
tion: sailing. Anyone, loving the out-
doors and water, could easily take to
relaxing in a sailboat, enjoying the club
life and sociability that goes with this
sport. If it ends there, sailing is only
a healthy pastime.

But, if the individual makes a study
of it, sailing develops a skilled navi-

gator, opens a new area of knowledge,
the subject of weather and tides, in-
creases manual dexterity, and promotes
an interest in building construction and
materials. Even more, to those for
whom it is an avocation, sailing offers
plenty of chances to practice thinking
quickly and correctly in a crisis.

John E. Caskey, U. S. Rubber’s vice-
president and general manager of its
Naugatuck Chemical Division, has an
interesting viewpoint. Actually, he is
a successful dual hobbyist, being an en-
thusiastic gardener and painter. He
paid attention first to gardening. Weath-
er, though, curtails this interest during
certain months. So, in the winter, he
began to paint. Painting has become a
philosophy with him, he points out,
rather than a hobby. “In summer I paint
with flowers, in winter with oils.”

Watch Out for This

Look at a hobby also from the view-
point of whether or not it turns you
into a participator. There is nothing
against spectator interests, in being a
theater fan for instance. But these in-
terests provide vicarious pleasures.
Someone else is in there pitching or en-
joying a success. So don’t sit all the
time during leisure hours.

A hobby that requires its pursuer to
participate is usually the one that out-
lasts other interests and influences per-
sonal development the most.

After getting the correct viewpoint,
consider how a hobby can be integrated
with your previous, or present, back-

MARCH 1955

ground. Can something fr om your
work, or your educational training, con-
tribute to the hobby’s development and
your own success in it? Is the hobby
a means of putting to work some skill
or knowledge you already possess?

Often it is this element of integration
that provides the high level of interest
necessary to propel an extremely busy
and alert executive into an avocation.
A hobby should perform this fusion
without duplicating the major aspects
of an individual’s vocation. It it doesn’t,
then he’s chosen the wrong hobby. For
the interest the hobby represents must
provide some contrast to one’s daily
work; and the activity should be a rela-
tively unfamiliar one at first.

The business man, for instance, who
thinks running another business in his
spare time is relaxation really is sprint-
ing as hard as he can to that tombstone:
I was well, but trying to be better, I am
here.

If this man Works with people all day,
his primary interest durin g leisure
hours could well be with things. Many
professional entertainers are noted for
their switch from people to things when
choosing a hobby. Microscopy caught
Harold Lloyd’s interest, for example;
and Fred Waring collects old furniture.

The opposite holds true, of course,
for anyone like a researcher. A survey
of science and technical men from well-
known companies was made recently by

Maurice Holland, New York industrial
research adviser, to discover what these
men do for avocations. Many of them
wisely hasten from their “ivory tower”
to spend time with people. For example,
those interested in bridge, poker, and
indoor sports like pool and bowling, in-
dicate that, aside from mental stimula-
tion, the strong appeal is mixing with
people. With photography, an attrac-
tion was: “Serves as an introduction to
fellow enthusiasts.” The same went for
community-service hobbies: “Meet non-
technical pe0ple.”

These researchers appear to be riding
their hobbies with common sense, which
brings up another point: the practical-
ity of certain hobbies for certain peo-
ple. Be practical in your choice, if you
want to find more than a time killer.

Don’t, say, pick something for which
you have no potential to be good at.
A hobby is meant to give self-satisfac-
tion; and it is unsatisfying to be a dud.
One should be physically and tempera-
mentally suited for the activity.

Chris Argyris of Yale’s Labor and
Management Center points out that
while hobbies are definitely an impor-
tant outlet for an executive’s pent-up
feelings, some_unfortunately often pick
up hobbies which increase, rather than
decrease, such tensions.

This runs contrary to a characteristic
of successful executives, as observed by
Argyris, which is their exhibition of a

DuPont’s president, Crawford H. Creenewalt, was the average amateur with a col-
lection of vacation photos until he became interested in bird movements. Now,
he shoots pictures unique from ornithologist’s as well as photographer’s view-

 

high-frustration tolerance. lt stems
from either a natural ability to work
effectively under frustrating conditions
without ever blowing up, or from the
methods these men develop to release
tension —— such as participating in a
sport that helps them let off steam.

Another practical pointer: A hobby
becomes a burden, not a release, when
it is out of line with one’s economic situ-
ation. Don’t steal money (or time) that
sensibly belongs to other parts of your
life.

Furthermore, if the selection of a
hobby is swayed by the possibility that
it “will make money, by golly” (stamp
or antique collecting), impracticality
once more creeps into the situation.
You pick a hobby primarily for the per-
sonal satisfaction to be gained from it,
not for its monetary rewards. Go into it

with idle money that won’t be missed.

If the hobby turns out to be a source
' of extra dollars, well and good. A sound

bet for a vocation after retirement is
certainly something on which to capi-
talize. One hardware executive always
kept a good machine-tool shop in his
basement. Later, upon retirement, he
moved to California, taking his equip-
ment along. The shop not only gave him
something to do but brought in addi-
tional income, for he rented space and
equipment to local handcraft hobbyists
not blessed with a similar set-up.

Here are a few more don’ts:

Don’t attempt to take up a hobby
simply because you want to meet more
people who can “help” you in business.
Both hobby and new friends will turn
sour on you.

Don’t fasten onto a hobby simply be-
cause you think you will be at home in
it since other people of your “type,” or
“social position” like it. Interest that is
stimulated by what the Joneses do falls
flat where hobbies are concerned.

Don’t expect to be uninterrupted in
your avocation. Count the fact that you
can leave and return to it as one of its
many blessings. As a matter of fact, the
way time is made for hobbies depends
on the individual’s personality and the
character of the activity.

Finally, see if a hobby can pass the
acid test of these two questions:

Will it still interest me if I achieve all
of my present goals—or if my daily
work is suddenly taken from me?

Am I concentrating on it, and doing
it well, rather than forcing it to com-
pete with too many outside interests?

Hobbies have been divided and sub-
divided into many classifications. Psy-
chologist Dr. L. G. Freeman, now ac-
tively engaged in developing a new kind
of test—one for avocational interests——
at Cornell University, specifies nine
areas: (1) collecting: the instinctive
tendency to gather stuff together; (2)
creating or re-creating: painting, pho-
tography, music, sculpture; (3) mental
skills: chess, bridge, word games; (4)
physical skills: sports; (5) handcrafts:
activity of the hands in woodworking,
metalcraft; (6) nature study: raising
plants, breeding animals; (7) social
and community services; (8) science,
mechanics, and inventing; (9) escape
reading and travel.

Dr. Freeman breaks down hobbies

When writing to our advertisers please mention RECREATION.

into this grouping which, though small,
still covers the entire range of avoca-
tional activities and represents basic
interests. While a man can exist with-
out having part in any of these nine
types of activity, his life will be richer
for them.

The one interest area, of the nine
listed, which Dr. Freeman regards with
some suspicion, especially for energetic
executives, is escape reading and travel.
For their tension reduction, it is too
passive. Also, a deeper analysis may
prove that this interest really is the out-
ward expression of a more fundamental
feeling. Thus, a science-fiction reader
may be essentially interested in the
sciences. Look behind your reading
habits; they may be hiding a more self- ‘
enriching interest.

Plenty of Know-How Dope

For the person wishing to study the
details of a specific hobby mu'ch ma-
terial is available. Among publications
produced by the National Recreation
Association, 8 West Eighth Street, New
York 11, New York, one, costing ten
cents, is Some Sources of Information
on Hobbies. Mostly, it lists books,
prices and publishers.

Man is by nature multiskilled. Unless
he is careful, though, the specialization
of the century he now lives in will push
him to the point where his personality
is sterile. For his daily life today doesn’t
force him to display any more than a
skill or two. The rest can wither un-
noticed, until he becomes, to any but the
primary circle in which he moves, a nar-
row, inept, fussy individual who speaks
only one social language. An executive,
to be successful, cannot allow this to
happen.

He helps to prevent this starvation of
self by understanding and properly
using a hobby—an activity half-way be-
tween hard work and play. It is one
area left where he can be as crazin
unique as he pleases without fear of con-
demnation, where he need feel no pres-
sure to conform, and where he can ini-
tiate and control action exactly as he
desires with no hints from his employer
or his community.

In this area of living, he finds an ego
builder (“a hobby makes everybody
somebody”) ; and a safe and sane way
to live with his limitations.

,4 CITY on ORGANIZATION operating
a swimming pool or beach has the
choice of offering a public service or
maintaining an attractive nuisance. No
facility or program is more popular and
none imposes greater responsibility for
the protection of the user.

Swimming and water sports are a
part of a broad recreation program. The
underlying principles and philosophy
are the same for swimming as for base-
ball, golf, picnicking, arts and crafts,
skating, or playgrounds. Satisfaction
comes from participation, the physical
exercise involved, relationships with
others (the social element), develop-
ment of skills or achievement. It can
include competition and certainly re-
quires cooperation. It is essentially an
individual activity and each person can
participate and find enjoyment on the
level of his own capacity and interest.
That is why good recreational swim-
ming pools are designed to provide 0p-
portunities for the dub as well as the
expert, and for all stages in between.

To a high degree, water activities
combine many of the most desirable
characteristics of constructive recrea-
tion. They are a natural for family par-
ticipation; they can be enjoyed equally
by the very young and the very old.
There is almost no limit to the skills that
can be acquired. They are of interest
to spectators as well as those who take
part. They promote good health and
safety. They offer opportunities for
special events, shows, carnivals, fiestas
and exhibitions, many forms of games,
contests and relays. The aesthetic ele-

ment is present in everything from«

graceful swimming, well-executed dives,
to synchronized swimming. They are
relatively inexpensive. They bring to-
gether a whole neighborhood or com-
munity and promote civic morale and

well-being. As much as any of the other
activities, they fulfill the purposes of
recreation—to refresh, renew, re-create.

The direction of such a program, in
order to fully achieve these objectives,
requires sound administration, quali-
fied leadership, specially trained per-
sonnel, promotion and publicity, pro-
gram planning, good maintenance, and
special attention to all matters of hy-
giene and safety. The degree to which
these responsibilities are discharged de-
termines the extent to which the pro-
gram is of service to the public.

The operation of a public facility
should be as efficient as any business in
which profit is the motive. Successful
commercial operators have learned that
courtesy, public relations, and attention
to all the wishes of their clients pay
dividends. They work hard for good
will because it increases profits.

Those of us performing public serv-
ices are in a position to go even further.
Our plans and decisions are based ex-
clusively upon whether they are in the
public interest, whether they will bene-
fit people—and whether the people will
like them. There is no weighing of per-
sonal gain against public advantage.
Public service means what it says and
just because it is publicly supported
does not mean that the service should
be inferior, performed grudgingly, or
be wanting in quality, style, or effi-
ciency. Our rewards come from the
knowledge that we have met human
needs and have satisfied the desires of
people, have contributed to their health
and happiness, and have done it com-
petently. We think in terms of people.

Rules and Regulations

Definite rules and regulations are an
absolute necessity for the operation of
pools and beaches. Obviously they are
for the protection of the participants
and accordingly should constantly be
explained, together with the reasons for
them. They should be posted conspicu-

ously and stated positively and courte-
ously whenever possible, and they
should be kept to the minimum required
to accomplish the purpose. Unless they
are enforced they are worse than useless
——they are harmful.

This means that they must be known
and understood by the personnel who
have the responsibility of enforcing
them, an important part of whose ob is
the maintenance of a safe, clean, and at-
tractive environment. It means that pool
personnel must not only know the rules
but be able to secure their observance
at all times with firmness and cordiality.
This takes skill in handling people, in
knowing what to do about discipline
problems, in anticipating trouble and
preventing it before it happens, in know-
ing when to get tough and act decisively
and when to warn and suggest.

Effective supervision cannot be ex-
pected without definite rules governing
the responsibilities of the personnel. The
person who accepts a job of this kind
commits himself to responsibility for
the lives of people. He must maintain
a constant vigilance on the job. He
should welcome rigid and detailed regu-
lations regarding his own behavior. He
should be glad to know exactly what is
expected of him because, in spite of
every effort to anticipate all the prob-
lems and emergencies, he still may be
forced to use his own udgment at times.

Liability
This subject can only be touched

upon at this time.* It involves enough

to warrant an entire meeting or even a
conference.

The operation of public recreation
facilities, including swimming pools, is
held to be either a governmental or a
proprietary function, and states vary in
their attitude depending upon court de-

* Anyone who wishes to pursue this subject
further should read the book, Liability in Pab-
lic Recreation, by Dyer and Lichtig, published
in 1949 by C. C. Nelson Publishing Company.

clsions or liability cases. Where recre-
ation is considered to be governmental,
it is held that, since this service or facil-
ity is maintained by the local govern-
ment as a necessary function for the
welfare or benefit of the public, it can-
not be held liable for accidents that may
occur. This goes back to the old con-
cept that “the king can do no wrong.”

The proprietary interpretation holds
that, in performing this service or
maintaining the facility, the govern-
ment is assuming the role 'of a private
operator, that the prOgram attracted
people to it and consequently liability
is assumed and damages must be paid
in case of accident. The fact that there
arefees or charges does not necessarily
affect the decision if the income is used
to help maintain the facility or prOgram.

Court decisions within a given state
are not necessarily consistent so that in
some states there is no clear cut distinc-
tion, making it impossible to predict the
outcome of a new case. In fact, there is
no assurance that precedents will be
followed, and there has been consider-
able shifting, usually army from the
governmental concept.

There also has tended to be a shift
nationally from governmental to pro-
prietary. This seems to have been a re-
sult, in large part, of the feeling that
exemption from liability tends to en—
courage negligence and that people
should have recourse when they have
suffered accidents. Negligence always
must be proven before damages are
granted.

Aside from the legal aspects we must
recognize the moral liability that is in-
herent in operating pools and beaches.
There is no escaping it. It is no service
to anyone to disregard people’s safety
through carelessness, negligence, ignor-
ance, or for any other reason. This
heavy responsibility devolves upon
every employee and cannot be impress-
ed upon them too strongly. It is not
enough to talk about it in the abstract.
The point is to do everything that can
be done to meet all standards. This can
and must be done.

Selling the Value of the Facility
to City Administration

The best promoter of swimming fa-
cilities in Kansas is something with
powers beyond our puny efforts—the

116

weather. Nothing in the way of the
written or spoken word, facts and fig-
ures, demonstrations or exhibits, is
nearly as convincing as a few days of
one hundred degrees in the shade.
There are, however, some gilt-edged
arguments for pools which can hardly
be ignored. A number of them have
been mentioned here. These and others,
which we could easily compile, should
be presented in, an effective way to both
public officials and the general public.

Other Facts

About 7,509 people drown each year
because of inability to save themselves.
A large percentage of these could have
been saved if they had been taught even
the rudiments of water safety and swim-
ming. The ability to swim will widen
an individual’s hobbies to include boat-
ing, fishing, sailing and other water
sports. Good swimming and safety must
be learned. A well-planned pool and a
management or administration which
stresses and promotes a good instruc-
tional program is a real public service.

A swimming pool ranks at the top of
the list in popularity of facilities. There-
fore, it is one of the best public rela-
tions assets that a city can have. Usual-
ly a pool is a magnet which draws peo-
ple into a community; it can be a good
business proposition for the town. These
are some of the things that should be
explained in the selling of a local pool
in the many ways at our disposal.

Training of All Staff Members

The only known way to carry out an
adequate program of pool operation and
management is through the training of
the personnel. It goes Without saying
that all the personnel should be care-
fully selected in the first place. They
must be trained for the particular jobs
they are to perform.

They need to know just what those
jobs are in detail. This calls for job de-
scriptions. This information, in writ-
ing, helps in the selection of workers
and in their supervision; it helps the
manager. organize the program of work;
and it helps the workers know what their
responsibilities are. It becomes a basis
for the training program,

Life guards should have refresher
courses before the pool opens. All em-
ployees should meet prior to the open-

ing to learn about pool procedures, rules
and regulations, and to discuss them.
The training should include discussions
on public relations, handling the pub-
lic, problems of discipline, emergencies
and how to prevent them. This pre-
training program should not be con-
densed to the point of being superficial.
It should be planned carefully.

The pre-training alone is not enough.
Regular weekly in-service training ses-
sions are also necessary to keep things
going smoothly, to take up problems
that inevitably arise, to plan the special
events, and to improve the service.

The Case For Creative Arts

Grace Stanistreet

In Recreation

From an address on the panel of Well-Rounded
Program at the 36th National Recreation
Congress.

WORDS ARE what we make them. They may be packed
with meaning or wrung dry. And there are levels of
meaning. For example, the word re-creation. If we look at
the word creation, it may refer to a hat or to the beginning
of the world. The latter is an awesome connotation but if
we look at it as building, then the word re-creation has a
friendly sound like rebuild, renew, refresh. The words art
and create have top levels of meaning that take us up into the
rarer atmospheres. These words applied, however, acquire
less austere meaning. Names are words and meaningless
until the name is known for its character. When a new trend
emerges it is named to differentiate it: “The New Look,”
“The New Deal,” “Progressive Education,” “The Creative
Arts.” In the process of adoption of new trends or ideas
some of the original design and purpose is lost or changed.
We must constantly redefine meaning and test results.

The word recreation has fared well. It has grown from
walk-on to starring role in the national scene. It must have

been one of the first names to incorporate within itself the

creative idea.

The word which is the keynote for my comments is crea-
tive. This word is enjoying a long run, but it has been used
carelessly so often it does not have the impact that it ought
to have. What we must do then is to make results measure
up to the original standard and intentions of the pe0ple who
first found it serviceable. When Hughes Mearns * was asked
many years ago what he called his kind of teaching, he was
silent and then he said: “You might call it a creative ap-
proach to education.” What was Mearns doing that was
different, that required a label? It was a difference in em-
phasis and concept. He changed the emphasis from subject
matter to child. He was “teaching individuals not geogra-
phy.” Here was a concept of education not as facts but as

needs. When Winifred Ward first conceived the idea that

fDr. Hughes Mearns, who has been a source of inspiration and
guidance to teachers and leaders of children for many years, is the
author of Creative Youth, The Creative Adult, and Creative Power.

MARCH 1955

  

Children’s need for what art experience can provide is so
great we must equip leaders with constructive attitudes
toward the arts. Recreation can lead this field of service.

dramatics belonged in the school program, in order to dis-
tinguish educational dramatics from exhibitionary drama-
tics, she called it creative dramatics. The need for a dis-
tinguishing label is apparent. When dancers since Isadora
Duncan and Ruth St. Denis recognized dance as a natural
joyous medium of eXpression for children, they called it
creative dance. Dances were not learned, but created.

From these uses of the word creative, we gather certain
implications, a relationship to education, a relationship to
the arts, andra relationship to children. An integrating pro-
cess is suggested by these inter-relationships and a means
by which we may arrive at the art of living. The factors in-
volved in this process are education, the individual’s source
of supply, and expression, our source of release———-“intake
and outgo.”

The very principles of recreation are those of the creative
approach: development of the individual, refreshment and
stimulation, opportunity for release. Recreation has become
recognized not as a thing apart from education but as a vital
means of learning. It takes place not only on the play field,
but wherever there is opportunity for personal enrichment
for fulfillment. And the rich recreation program provides
many of these opportunities through the creative arts.

Recreation itself has demonstrated the fact that artistic
expression makes all we do more effective. Physical rhyth-
mic execution of a task or a movement saves time, eases
strains. The sense of fitness and appropriateness preserves
beauty, makes order itself a thing of beauty. Singing while
we work or play makes for happy experience. Recreation
has been coordinating for years; but it can incorporate, it
can emphasize the arts to an even greater extent.

When we speak of the creative arts, we are talking of per-
sonal expression, communication and satisfactions by means
of music, movement, acting, painting, drawing, modeling.

GRACESTANISTREET is the director of the Adelphi Children’s
Theatre at Adelphi College, Garden City, New York.

117

We are not talking of busy work or of skills. We do not
necessarily refer to classes :in painting or dramatics but of
opportunities to learn by doing what is natural for us to do.
What is recreation but doing things we enjoy? What do
children enjoy? They enjoy projecting themselves beyond
themselves and in so doing, they grow. They paint, they act,
they sing, they dance. They need to do these things. With-
out opportunity and encouragement they stop doing them.
Many adults know the hurt of not being able to satisfy needs
similar to these.

One of the reasons for some lack of interest in the arts
for children is because of the emphasis on self-expression.
Self-expression is a distasteful word to some because they
interpret it as undisciplined activity. In reality, artistic ex-
pression requires self-discipline of the highest order. If we
desire to express, we have purposeful expression, meaning-
ful expression. Expression is the result of knowledge and of
experience, and an indication of a free person. Recreation’s
major concern is to free pe0ple.

I am convinced that acting eXperience is important for
all children. The more indirectly they receive the oppor-
tunity, and the more it is tied in with all they do, the more
valuable the eXperience. Acting is not a subject to be studied
by children; but acting as doing, as behavior, as fun, should
be part of living for children.

How are they to get this opportunity? Through their
leaders and teachers who may not be actors or students of
theatre but who recognize how valuable it is to capitalize
on this natural response to life, to guide children to a 'way

of life. Here is a teacher who in teaching geography drama-
tizes, makes the whole country alive on an imaglnary bus
trip. Here is a scout leader who draws her group together
with a project, something to entertain a group of handi-
capped children.

In the course of this development, the members of the
group discover themselves and their community. They learn
to take responsibility, they learn to apply many kinds of
knowledge. This is what we call an integrating eXperience.
We know today the dangers of departmentalization. We
know from bitter experience we cannot be self-suiiicient and
we cannot separate learnings; but, rather, we must integrate
learnings and learning with life.

Of course the special arts program has a place when
skilled art teachers are available, when children are ready
with interest and desire, when sponsorship can support such
a program. But the need of the many children for what art
experience can provide is so great that we can best satisfy
this need by equipping leaders and teachers with construc-
tive attitudes towards the arts, techniques of using them,
and belief in their importance.

Recreation, because of its positive attitude toward the
creative arts, because of its present achievement in the area,
can lead in this field of service. Recreation leaders can
subtly educate a public beginning to sense the full meaning
of the word. Leaders can, by direct approach to educators,

Leatherwork and coppercraft were featured in the school,
each man completing both a leather and a copper project.
These included leather purses, belts, and wallets, many with
intricate carving. The copper items included plaques, medal-
lions, and ash trays, all of them polished and lacquered to a
high luster. Emphasis was placed on the techniques of in-

Recreation as a Function of Government in Virginia

This report* by James E. Pate, professor of political sci-
ence, College of William and Mary, consisting of ninety type-
written pages and including numerous charts and tabula-
tions, is very comprehensive and could act as a guide to
state departments and state organizations other than those in
Virginia. It shows how the Inter-Agency Committee on Rec-
reation was created by executive order of the governor of
Virginia and includes the functions of such committees. Or-
ganizations and personnel contributing to the report are
authorities familiar with Virginia problems and interests.

The report recognizes that the program should function
through all types of agencies, public, private, and commer-
cial. Many times the commercial side of recreation is almost
forgotten in such studies.

It further recognizes that recreation deals with people.
It devotes considerable space to bringing to the attention of
the committee information on population growth, age
spreads, relationship of urban to rural populations, employ-
ment, business trends and characteristics of the people.

Delinquency and criminal acts as committed were studied
with a view to determining whether recreation acts as a pre-
ventive. Mental disease was also studied for leads to possi-
ble relationship. Particular recognition was given to federal
recreation activities in Virginia and to recreation activities
of state agencies.

Often missed in an article of this kind, written from the
state level, is the point of view of local communities and how
they serve adjacent communities and accept the services of
state agencies and organizations. A section of the report
devoted to information of this nature shows clearly the im-
mediate need of cooperation and coordination on all levels
of government.

In discussing the various state divisions, the report not
merely records the information submitted by the divisions,
but in many cases suggests problems that should be solved
and certain adjustments to their thinking that should be
made. Recommendations are made throughout the report.

A separate table recorded the park services in 87 cities and
counties also rendering year-round recreation services. The
total amount budgeted for the park agencies for 1954-1955
was $8,518,084 for operation and $1,365,246 for capital pur-
poses. Comparable figures for 204 recreation agencies, in-
cluding combined recreation and park agencies, were 835,-
625,389 for operation and $6,083,384 for capital items.

Other sections of the report deal with administrative titles,
employment practices, employed personnel and rates of pay
in selected recreation positions. The personnel reported by
203 public recreation agencies included 147 full-time and
56 part-time administrators, 49 full-time and 12 part-time
assistant administrators, 233 full-time and 188 part-time and
seasonal supervisors. In addition 745 full-time recreation
leaders and specialists were reported; 4,538 such workers

employed part—time and 5,056 others employed on a sea-
sonal basis.

Great advance has been made in presenting organized
baseball programs for boys at various age levels. All have
specific advantages and disadvantages characteristic of ac-
tivity programs of this nature. Our own baseball program
is conducted by the Cortland Recreation Commission as an
integral phase of the summer recreation program.

In 1949 the boys’ baseball program was organized for
participants of various age levels. Thus we had four classi-
fications: Grasshopper League for boys twelve years of age
and under; Midget League for boys thirteen and fourteen
years old; Junior League for youths fifteen and sixteen years
of age, and Senior League for lads nineteen years old and
under. As the season progressed, this program presented
several indications and trends. The most important trend
was the fact that boys in organizing squad personnel did so
strictly on the basis of ability, the ultimate result being that
all the best players banded together on one or two squads
in each classification. This obviously resulted in 10psided
victories for a few teams, humiliating defeats for all others.

No participants benefited from this program to any ex-
tent. lnstead of attracting all possible participants to the
play areas, we were in reality accomplishing the opposite.
A study of the facts proved that forfeits were directly at-
tributable to this failure of basic organization structure.
N 0 one enjoys being “trounced,” and actually very few peo-
ple derive much satisfaction from an easy victory. The
number of participants indicated that interest was highest
in the young classification and gradually decreased as the
groups advanced to older classifications.

To rectify these problems so our baseball program would
achieve the objectives for which it was organized, several
alterations were necessary. The recreation department em-
ployed a well-qualified and respected individual, Carl “Chug-
ger” Davis, as boys’ baseball director. Mr. Davis has been
physical education instructor and coach at Cortland State

A Testing Program

Vincent L. Fowler

Teachers College since 1929. He is a graduate of Missouri
State Teachers College and Springfield College.

Utilizing the information and data we had compiled on
previous league standings, participants, forfeits, and aver-
ages, we decided that a baseball school was necessary in
order to achieve the objectives of the community recreation
program. This was organized. Each morning boys in the
age group of twelve years and under would participate in
group drills and motor ability skills. Afternoons were de-
voted to older boys divided into two sections, fifteen years
and under, and nineteen years and under. Adjustments in
the level of baseball instruction were of a nature suited to
the specific age group difference.*

Equipment. Batting tees were improvised from discarded
gallon buckets, broom handles, and bicycle tires. These were
constructed at various heights depicting the different levels
at which the pitcher makes his delivery. Wetting down the
sand filled buckets prior to usage aided in retaining the ex-
tension handles in place.

Rectangular pitching targets were also constructed from
two lengths of baling wire stretched between two anchor
sites. (We used a nine-gauge wire-fence tennis backstop
and light pole for anchorage.) Spaced approximately ten
feet apart, targets were formed between the suspended wires.
These were made of white or yellow twine and represented
the rectangular target seventeen inches wide across home
plate and the distance between the batter’s armpits and knees
in normal batting stance. Wire loops were made at the
points of anchorage. At both ends of the suspended wire
lengths, a light coil-spring and Spring-snap were attached.
Thus, the entire rig could be assembled or taken down in a
few moments. Catchers could be "utilized behind the target
with no danger of being struck by deflected balls (usually
the result of taut wire).

This testing device was made more realistic by improvis-
ing home plates and pitching rubbers from ends of orange
crates and painting them white. These were each secured
to the ground by two marine spikes and tamped to surface
level, and they could be set down or removed with economy
of time and effort.

Evaluation. The testing program was an individualized
subjective evaluation. Each lad was observed, and his me-
chanical kinesthetic reactions analyzed in skill tests utilizing
the improvised testing devices previously mentioned. Sup-
plementing the batting test from the stationary tee, and the
control pitch, were skill tests in fielding ground balls and
infield throw (combined), and the fielding of flyballs and the
long throw (combined).

Every participant was given a rating on a scale which in-
dicated values of: one—above average; two—average; three
——below average. It was considered essential that each par-
ticipant be tested and udged in his specific age group. The
most important finding in Cortland’s testing program was
that a definite cleavage was found in the age bracket twelve
years and under. This prompted a further division in our
instruction programs. Boys eight to ten years were organized
into a nine o’clock section, and those eleven to twelve into a
ten-thirty section. This marked inability of boys ten and
under to compare favorably with boys eleven and twelve,
caused us to revamp our age groups for league play also.

Selection of Squads

Having made the basic subjective test evaluations, Mr.
Davis, John Moiseichik, playground supervisor and phy-
sical education teacher in Cortland’s elementary schools,
and the author proceeded to select squads of fifteen boys.
Consideration was given to individual rating and age in
the selection of each player. Using an alphabetized list of
participants in each group, we equalized teams as nearly as
possible. For instance: Adams John, age twelve, rating two,
was assigned to team number one in his age classification.

We continued down the list until every team in that classi-
fication was assigned a player, age twelve, rating two. Parti-
cipants rated one and three were assigned to each squad in
a similar manner. With this method, teams in each age
group were equalized as much as possible.

Our organized league classifications resulted as follows:
Pee Wee League, ten years and under; Grasshopper Leagrue,
eleven and twelve years; Junior League, thirteen, fourteen
and fifteen years; Senior League, sixteen, seventeen, eight-
een, and nineteen years. As the participant’s age increased.
the particular classification was inclusive of greater age
range. This was an attempt to maintain the competitive level
in direct relationship with the maturation period.

To further check the chance of human error, three addi-
tional days were devoted to playing under game conditions.
To facilitate the process, three teams participated in each
game. Team number one started in the field, rotated to ob-
servation, and then batted. Rotation continued until all
teams of a specific age classification had participated against
one another. Obvious weaknesses or strengths necessitating
adjustments in squad personnel'were then made.

In selection of squad personnel, possible problems had to
be anticipated. Special consideration was given to assure
each squad of capable catching and pitching. Successful
operation was insured by placing on each squad two boys
who had known or exhibited strong characteristics of lead-
ership. In an effort to place importance on the acceptance
of responsibility, all squads elected their own captains and
co-captains. Surprisingly enough, all potential leaders whom
we had placed on squad rosters were selected.

In addition, each team had'to appoint or elect three mem-
bers to the “call committee.” Each member of this commit-
tee had the responsibility of informing four other teammates
of each playing date, time, and location. These boys had to
be individuals other than the captain and co-captain. Inter-
est was constant and actually increased during the season.

Sponsorship of any teams was procured through the ef-
forts of that team. Selection and ordering of uniforms with-
in the scope of the respective sponsors’ generosity were team
problems. Complete business transactions between sponsor,

team, and sporting goods dealer were conducted and com- a

T-shirts and caps by selling tickets to the Lions Club circus.

In ventures of this nature, cooperative factions must have
previous orientation as to what is to be expected. This was
accomplished through the medium of public relations by the
recreation department. This phase. of the organized baseball
program is important. A fine learning experience and ex-
posure to future responsibilities were presented to the par-
ticipants in a controlled situation.

Our 1952 records and data concerned with the integrated
summer playground program conclusively indicated mutual
benefits for all participants in the baseball program. Attend-
ance figures increased in all planned activities such as swim-
ming instruction, golf, archery, crafts, and quiet games.
This was, in part, attributable to evenly contested baseball
games and league competition which originally attracted
participants to play areas. This latter point is especially im-
portant as boys would come to play baseball regardless of
their individual native abilities, because each team encoun-
tered successful experiences to some degree. Once on the
play area, individuals were directed by competent recrea-
tion leaders into other worthwhile leisure activities.

This year, our integrated boys’ baseball program gives
every indication of being more instrumental in the develop-
ment of a qualitative community recreation program. To a
great extent, this reflects the organization efforts of the rec-
reation commission and the essential community coopera-
tion which insures maximum returns from maximum efforts.

Seating for Spectators

Every pool, regardless of type, attracts persons who enjoy
seeing others have a good time in the water. Fathers and
mothers like to watch their children in the small neighbor-
hood pool, and adults are more likely to bring groups of
children to a pool if comfortable, shaded facilities, where
they can sit and see the children, are provided nearby. Such
facilities also help to make customers out of spectators.

Special events such as swimming meets, water pageants,
and aquatic carnivals attract great numbers of spectators to
the large city pool, where ample seating facilities are essen-
tial. The question of the amount and type of seating to be
provided therefore must be considered in the planning of

every pool in order that suitable space may be set aside for it. '

Permanent bleachers have been provided more often at
the large pools designed for competitive and feature events
than at smaller units, but there is evidence that Seating fa-
cilities increasingly are considered an essential pool fea-
ture. Permanent seats are commonly supplemented by re-
movable bleachers when special events are held. Seats

will not be in the eyes of the spectators. A location near the
deep end and at right angles to the diving boards is desirable.
The roof of the bathhouse or filter building is used as a
spectators’ gallery at some pools, in which case access to the
roof must be from outside the pool area.

Spectator space should be entirely separated from that
used by the bathers, preferably by a low fence that will not
interfere with a view of the pool activities. If seating area
is of concrete construction it should be sloped to a drain so
it can be flushed with a hose without any water entering the
area used by bathers. A low curb to prevent dirt from being
carried into the pool area may be essential.

The Wading Pool

Swimming is a favorite form of family recreation and, in-
creasingly, family groups are encouraged to use community
pools. At some of these, with a minimum depth of a foot or
less, a portion of the shallow section is fenced off for use by
small children. At others a concrete wall separates a shallow
children’s area from the main pool. Since the minimum
water depth in most pools is three feet or more, however,
they obviously are not suitable for use by very young chil-
dren. Consequently, there is a growing tendency to con-
struct a separate wading pool as an adjunct to the swimming
pool. The wading pool is usually completely enclosed by a
fence in order to prevent the young children from wander-
ing into the swimming pool area. The wading pool is com-
monly located in an area adjoining the swimming pool deck
so that parents using the pool can easily see their children
in the wading pool. Proximity to the toilets in the bathhouse
is desirable.

Dimensions of the Wading pool are usually twenty by thir-
ty feet or more and the water depth commonly varies from
six to twenty inches. The pool bottom should not slope more
than one foot in fifteen. A paved walk several feet wide
should surround the pool, and paving of the entire area with-
in the pool enclosure is desirable. A concrete curb or coping
a few inches high commonly extends around the edge of the
pool. Benches should be provided along the fence for the

125

use of mothers who bring their children to the pool, and a
pergola or canvas shelter is sometimes erected to afford
shade for them. A sand beach or court is a great attraction
and provides valuable play opportunities; a sand trap is es-
sential in a pool adjoining a sand area.

It is customary at playground wading pools to have a con-
tinuous How of water into the pool while in use and to empty
and clean the pool daily. When part of a swimming pool
installation, however, the wading pool can be tied in with
the recirculation system and filled with chlorinated water at
the pr0per temperature. The water can thus be kept clean
and purified, and the possibility of pollution that exists in
the fill-and-draw type of pool is eliminated. Inlets are often
installed that enable the water to be brought into the pool in
the form of showers or fountain sprays—a popular feature
if the water is not too cold. In some wading pools the water
is not returned to the filters, but the pool is emptied daily
and refilled with treated water.

The Bathhouse

The bathhouse is an essential feature of every outdoor
pool development except where the pool adjoins a building
which can provide the needed facilities. It is more readily
seen by the passerby than is the pool itself and should there-
fore be so designed as to present an attractive appearance
appropriate to the site and in harmony with the pool and its
related facilities. The building should be readily accessible
from the street and the parking area. It is often advisable
to place the bathhouse where it will protect the pool from
prevailing winds. Most authorities believe it should be at
the shallow end of the pool so as to reduce the likelihood that
children and poor swimmers will thoughtlessly run from the
building and jump into the deep water.

Many bathhouses are of architectural concrete or of ce-
ment blocks with a stucco finish—[materials which fit in with
the construction of most pools. The building usually oc—
cupies at least one third as much space as the water area of
the pool. Bathhouse facilities are sometimes incorporated
in a recreation building, in which case they serve a dual
purpose and are used the year round.

Several factors should influence the design and construc-
tion of every bathhouse. It should be planned in such a way
that it can be supervised and operated by a minimum staff.
Units should be arranged so that circulation of bathers
through the building and to and from the pool is easy and
direct. Rooms should be light and well ventilated. Materials
used should be impervious to moisture; and floors, walls,
and equipment should be constructed so as to facilitate clean-
ing. Interiors painted in various colored pastel shades are
reported most satisfactory and least likely to be defaced.

The chlorinator should be placed in a separate room,
equipped with a device to assure ventilation of any escaping
chlorine gas. In some cases the lobby and dressing rooms
are planned so the equipment can be removed and the rooms
used for group activities outside the swimming season.

Essential units in the bathhouse are a lobby, which serves
as a center of control, and separate dressing, shower, and
toilet rooms for men and for women bathers. Additional
facilities are a manager’s office, first aid room, checkroom

for bags or baskets, equipment storage room, room for pool
staff, snack bar, and toilet rooms for non-bathers. The filters,
heater, and chlorination apparatus are usually installed in

the bathhouse.

The size and type of pool determine the number, types and
sizes of the facilities required at a particular pool. The
Joint Committee on Bathing Places1 has suggested the fol-
lowing standards for certain facilities, based on the assump-
tion that two thirds of the bathers present at any one time

will be men:

1 shower for each 40 bathers
1 lavatory for each 60 bathers
1 toilet for each 40 women

1 toilet for each 60 men

1 urinal for each 60 men

In some sections there is a tendency to build dressing fa-
cilities of an “open court” type as they are less expensive,
the sun and air help in keeping them clean, and they are less
susceptible to vandalism.

Much useful literature is available on the planning and
equipment of dressing, shower, and toilet rooms, but little
has been written about the bathhouse lobby and checkroom.
The following suggestions by C. P. L. Nicholls, municipal
supervisor of aquatics in Los Angeles, are consequently of
special interest:

“The function of the lobby is to provide a place where fees are ac-
cepted, tickets are issued, and if suits and towels are to be furnished
they are given to patrons entering the pool over the counter provided.
The lobby must therefore have a counter with spaces for checking
valuables, space for a ticket machine, space for a changemaker or
cash register, whichever system is to be used, and cupboards and
closets to store cash report forms, and cubbyholes and boxes to store
the valuables checked for safekeeping by patrons.

“In the smaller pools the checking racks are stored behind this
counter. The clothes are stored in plastic checking bags which are
passed through the windows on each side of the counter from the boys’
dressing room on one side and the girls’ dressing room on the other.
Appropriate baffles are arranged so that the checking personnel may
not have a view of the dressing room in order to provide the necessary
privacy for those using these spaces. It is customary in some installa-
tions to provide electric Outlets and wall space for vending machines.
Wall space is also provided for bulletin boards, trophy cases, and also
some bench space for those waiting for friends.

“In small pools clothes are stored behind the counter space in the
lobby room; in large pools space for checkrooms must be provided on
the boys’ side and also on the girls' side. However, no matter where
the eheekrooms are located, the same square-foot area is required per
bag, and in the planning of the checkrooms this factor must be kept
in mind; for instance, for each bag checked 1.5 square feet may be
allowed for each when two rows high of checking bags are planned.”

arge rectangular pool, Redwood City, California. The popu-
larity of the shallow area, use of deck space and protective
wall, and the need for additional seating facilities is apparent.

Bags or baskets are now used more widely than lockers
for the checking of bathers’ clothing. Few dressing facilities
are provided at the small neighborhood pools in several
cities, because a majority of the bathers walk to the pool
dressed for swimming. Shower as well as toilet facilities
are essential, however, since a warm bath in the nude is con-
sidered a “must” for bathers by many pool and health au-
thorities.

Site Requirements

The preceding sections of this article have dealt primarily
with the phases of pool design which are related to space and
which determine the amount of area that must be set aside
for this type of facility. The pool itself, the deck, sunning
areas, seating facilities, wading pool, game courts, refresh-
ment area, parking space, the bathhouse and its setting——
all are important elements in the well-rounded swimming
center. Some of them may be omitted at a specific project,
but they all should bedconsidered in planning for the pool.
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that, in selecting the
site for a pool, sufficient space be available to meet these
varied requirements. The problem cannot be solved by build-
ing the pool in the corner of an over-crowded recreation
area or on any other restricted site. An ample, well-chosen

site, on the other hand, is a big factor in assuring a popular,
successful pool.

Pool Construction Factors

The construction of an outdoor pool requires considera-
tion of a large number of factors, some of which are ob-
vious. Others, however, are sometimes overlooked until after
the pool is put in use, when it is impossible or difficult to
provide for them. A few of these factors will be mentioned
briefly below. As previOusly stated, the construction of a
pool should be undertaken only after a design has been pre-
pared by a competent architect or engineer. Valuable infor-
mation on construction details will be found in the bibli-
ography to appear in the April issue of RECREATION.

Type of Construction. A pool should be built of material
that provides a watertight tank with a smooth, light—colored,
and easily cleaned surface. Reinforced concrete (usually
form poured) has been used most widely in the construction

MARCH 1955

 

of public pools. In recent years pneumatically applied rein-
forced concrete, commonly known as gunite, has been used,
especially for smaller pools in sections of the country which
do not have extremely cold winters. Its cost is appreciably
less than that of form-poured concrete. A precast steel-
reinforced concrete pool consisting of a poured concrete
floor and twenty-foot precast wall sections was constructed
in 1954. Wall sections, complete with fittings set in the
panels, were lowered in place after the floor was poured, then
bolted tight. This type of construction, permitting as it does
a drastic reduction in the time required to build a normal
poured pool and a considerable saving in building costs,
merits study.

The use of steel for the walls and floor of pools is receiv-
ing considerable attention and several such pools have been
built by municipalities. ‘Few, if any, of these municipal pools
have been in use long enough to afford a basis for compar-
ing them with concrete pools, as to ease of maintenance and
length of life. The statement has been made that, so far,
steel pools appear to have “a susceptibility to soil acids that
cause leakage and rust.” A considerable difference of opin-
ion prevails as to the comparative construction cost of steel
and reinforced concrete pools.

Regardless of the material used, it is desirable that the
corners of the pool wall be rounded to facilitate cleaning.
The number of expansion joints should be at a minimum.

Finish. The lining of the pool walls and bottom should be
of a white or light-colored material so that persons or 0b-
j ects in the water will be clearly Visible. Among the various
materials used for finishing the concrete surface of a pool
are white cement and silica sand smoothly finished, marble
dust and chips mixed with sand and cement, and a plaster
finish such as “silicite.” Care must be taken to protect the
'finish of the pool during construction to prevent it from be-
ing soiled or stained.

Use of such materials makes it unnecessary to paint the
walls and floor—an operation that must be repeated every
year or two. If the pool is painted, the recommendations of
the manufacturer should be followed precisely. A white
paint is generally believed to be most satisfactory although
color is often used. Paint should be applied only to thor-
oughly cleaned surfaces.

Tile, terra cotta, and precast concrete slabs may be used
for the inner lining, but, because of the cost, they are rarely
used in municipal pools. Asphaltic materials do not show
the dirt readily or make the bottom easily visible, so are not
considered suitable for pool lining.

Walls and Floors. Side and end walls of all pools should

be vertical, as they can be be cleaned readily and are less of
a hazard than sloping walls. As previously indicated, the
poured reinforced concrete wall is most widely used and
generally favored. Walls must be designed to'withstand the
water pressure from within when filled and the pressure of
the surrounding earth when empty.

Precautions must be taken to protect the walls and floor

against damage by frost or external water pressure through
adequate subsurface drainage. The expansion oints in
walls should be keyed and made watertight. In general,
pool walls are not less than ten inches thick and floors not
less than six inches thick. Thickness, as well as the amount
of reinforcement needed, depends upon many local factors.

Overflow Cutters and Copings. An overflow gutter or
trough is an essential feature of every pool, and it is gener-
ally recommended that it extend around the entire perimeter
of the pool. The overflow. serves to remove foreign matter
from the pool surface and affords a handhold for tired swim-
mers and for practicing strokes and kicking.

/‘" //”‘”‘-

Among several types of overflows, the following are typi-
cal: inset, back-set, and open or roll-out. The accompanying
sketch illustrates the general nature of these types. The
inset gutter, long the most widely used, has the advantage
of being recessed; it therefore does not interfere with the
swimmer and he is unlikely to come in contact with waste
materials entering it. It is reported to have a better wave
reduction factor than the other two types—a consideration
in pools designed for competitive swimming. It is difiicult
to clean and repair, however, and has sometimes been built
so that an arm may be caught in it.

Widely installed in recent years, the back-set type differs
chiefly in that it is more open and hence easier to clean.
The roll-out gutter is entirely open to the light and is there-
fore easy to clean. It does not afford as good a handhold
as the other two types and unless it is fairly level it may
make entry into the pool more difficult. On the other hand,

it enables the swimmer to get out of the pool much more'

easily. An increasing number of pools are installing the roll-
out type. In the Conference for National C00peration in
Aquatics study mentioned in Part I, more people indicated
a preference for this than for any other type of gutter.

128

In all three types the bottom of the gutter should pitch
at least one-quarter-inch per foot between drains, which
should be installed at intervals of not more than fifteen feet
around the pool. In the inset and back-set overflows, the
width of the trough opening is generally at least three inches
and the depth at least four inches so the swimmers” fingers
will not reach the bottom of the trough. The roll-out gutter
is usually at least ten inches wide, so the swimmer may rest
on it after leaving the pool.

Many authorities recommend installation of a curb or
coping along the edge of the pool deck above the gutter.
This prevents much dirt from being blown or washed into
the pool and allows the use of high-pressure water lines for
washing the deck. The pool gutter is usually of concrete,
although some are lined with tile. One pool designer highly
recommends that the overflow gutter and coping be made
of Indiana limestone which is cut at the quarry. Although
more expensive than formed concrete, it fits into place more
readily and is permanent.

The flush deck pool, a relatively new type, has no gutter,
trough, or coping. The water is kept at the level of the deck,
so swimmers may readily pull themselves out of the water.
The problem of cleaning gutters is also eliminated. Reported
disadvantages are that a backstroke swimmer may find him-
self on the pool deck, and that the deck is constantly wet,
and therefore slippery, and inconvenient for persons teach-
ing or officiating around the pool. Furthermore, dirt and
other foreign matter are deposited on the deck instead of in
the gutter where they are carried away quickly.

Ladders and Steps. These, of corrosion-resistant materi-
als, are essential to facilitate egress from the pool. They
should be provided along each side of the deep end of a rec—
tangular pool, preferably fifteen feet or more from the end.
One or more additional ladders on each side are usually
required, depending upon length of pool. At least one lad-
der or recessed stair is needed near the shallow end if the
minimum water depth is more than two feet. Ladders should
not be placed at the ends of the pool. In a diving pool or
bay, it is desirable to place them on the side opposite the
boards or tower, so that divers may leave the water promptly
after completing a dive.

As a rule, ladders should have a handrail on either side
at the t0p, leading out over the deck or coping, and be con-
structed so they can be removed easily for repairs or when
the pool is used for special or competitive events. The treads-
should be of non-slip material and built so a swimmer can-
not catch his arms or legs between the ladder and the pool
wall. In some cases the ladders are recessed, with step holes
inserted in the pool walls. Where this is done, they should
he designed to be cleaned readily.

In case the area around the pool is uneven or the pool
and the bathhouse are not on the same level, the use of ramps
rather than steps is recommended, where feasible.

richer and more complete. And what a list there is to choose
from! Collecting things—anything that strikes one’s fancy;
making things-u-nwith any of a wide variety of materials;
picturing things—with brush, pencil or camera; raising
things—Hora and fauna. All these are fun-filled hobbies,

recreation director, schools, YMCA or YWCA, churches

with parish houses, other organizations which might be
helpful. Make use of every available resource. Coopera-
tion with the community is good public relations. Also make
your own facilities available to the community. Such neigh-
borliness pays.

Somewhere, somehow, you will find a suitable meeting
place for each hobby group. These quarters must be avail-
able at convenient hours and readily accessible by public
conveyance, unless you can work out car pools which will
accommodate all the members of the various groups.

What About the Others?

The hobbies in which a few people expressed interest, but
‘ in which the formation of a group was not warranted? Talk

lto the people who checked these interests. Find out whether
'tlley just have a vague idea that beekeeping, for example,
|:might be fun, or whether they have a real interest in and
working knowledge of the subject. If one or two of them
ll really know something about it, you might arrange for these
people to give a short talk in an appropriate place; give them
a chance to interest others!

A window display or shelf show of their work (see more
about this in section on hobby shows) might help to stimu-
late interest to the point where a group can be formed. If
outside help is available, use it. 'Ask someone in the com-
munity who is interested in this hobby to come in and talk
to your group about it.

 

MARCH 1955

PROGRAM

In industry, the place of the hobby groups in the over-all
program may be determined by each group having a repre-
sentative on the plant recreation council; or the hobby pro-
gram may be treated as a unit, with one or more representa-
tives elected from the entire hobby membership.

They may pay dues to an over-all organization or they may
be more or less autonomous, with dues paid and expended by
and for each individual club. Most hobbyists prefer the lat-
ter arrangement. Whether or not the hobby clubs receive
any subsidy from management will, of course, depend upon
company policy.

Beware of Too Much Organization—
Too Much Leadership

Business meetings should be as short—and as few—as
possible. The members are there to work or talk about their
hobbies. The recreation director should be as inconspicu-
ous as possible, and when things are running smoothly he
should be completely invisible. He should keep his ear to
the ground, know just how each group is getting along, and
help when problems arise; but the members should be en-
couraged to determine and work out their own program.
They want the fun of doing things themselves.

Give Special Attention to Those
Nearing Retirement Age

Retirement can be tragic, empty, aimless; or it can be
the fulfillment for which the individual has worked—the
period in his life when he has time for the things he wants
most to do. The recreation director can help to determine
which it is to be. Some industries are now setting up educa-
tion-for-retirement programs. Some time before the actual
retirement date—several years, if possible—the industrial
recreation director should discuss with the employee what
he plans to do after he retires. The director should help to
guide the employee in the selection of a hobby that he will
be able to pursue for the rest of his life. If it has some
money-making possibilities, so much the better. This type
of hobby gives a man an added sense of being useful, and
the extra dollars will be a welcome supplement to his pension.
Whatever the recreation director does for these older work-
ers should be coordinated with the company’s retirement
plan.

The recreation director, in whatever situation, should do
everything in his power to make hobbies so important to in-
dividuals that they can look forward to their retirement as a
time when they will be able to devote many more hours to
these absorbing interests.

Hobby Shows

To have a thing is nothing,
if you’ve not the chance to show it.
And to know a thing is nothing,
unless others know you know it.—Lord Nancy"

Everyone Likes to Show 0]}. People who have collected
something or created something with their own hands have
more right than most of us to want to show off a little. Hob-
byists like to see other people’s work; they like even better
to display their own work; best of all, they like to win some

"\

131

sort of recognition. They’ll be pleased with ribbons or cer-
tificates of merit; they’ll be delighted with inexpensive
trophies. If, as sometimes happens, the best work of art is
purchased for permanent exhibit, they’ll be out of this
world!

You don’t need a great big space. Of course, if there is
a recreation hall, or a community house, armory, or other
suitable building in the neighborhood, that’s fine; but if
there just isn’t any such place—~put your imagination to
work! Build a set of shelves; use your windows as display
cases; look for a vacant store; go outdoors and let the com-
munity in on the fun.

Shelf Shows can go on all year round. Somewhere there
is a corner that will accommodate a cabinet or a bank of
shelves—perhaps in the lobby or cafeteria, any place where
the majority of persons will see it in the course of their nor-
mal routine.

Before the shelves are built, talk to the hobbyists them-
selves; get some idea of the size and shape of the articles
that probably will be exhibited. Try to work out a pattern
that will be adaptable to many different displays. Adjust-
able shelves usually will prove to be the most practical.

Use a neutral finish which will harmonize with everything,
ivory or light gray if the shelves are painted, or a natural
wood finish if the wood you are using is light and has an
attractive grain. Glass doors that can be locked will protect
the display from dust—and from anyone who might be over-
come by a desire to possess any of the exhibits!

The shelves may contain: a one-man show, an exhibit by
all the members of any one of the hobby clubs, selections
from the work of all the hobby clubs. Don’t let the exhibits
“get stale.” Change them every two or three weeks to at-
tract continuing interest, and to allow as many people as
possible to show their treasures.

Window Shows are eye-catchers! The whole community
will stop to look at them if they are displaying: collections
—buttons, china figurines, art from other lands; models—
boats, automobiles, airplanes; dolls—perhaps the ones your
group dressed to give neighborhood youngsters at Christmas.

Anything that one person is interested in making or own-
ing, others will be interested in seeing. Here, too, change
the display often. If you haven’t enough material for a con-
tinuing exhibit, make the show an annual event, lasting for
a week or two. Invite people in the community to display
their handwork or collections, and don’t forget the children.
Invite Boy and Girl Scout tr00ps, playground youngsters,
and school art classes to set up shows. Be a good neighbor
—-—-you need the community and the community needs you!

Vacant Stores allow room for the exhibitors, too. Hold-
ing the hobby show in a store that is temporarily unoccupied
will make it possible for the exhibitors to meet the spectators
and to give talks and demonstrations. The weaver can work
at his loom; the artist can paint at his ease]; the puppeteer
can give a performance; the collector can tell the stories he-
hind the very special pieces in his collection.

They can all bring their hobbies to life, make them morc

interestlng to others, and perhaps influence the spectators to
take up hobbies of their own.

Hold Outdoor Art Exhibits. Many communities are now
presenting the sidewalk art exhibits which have long been a
familiar sight in Paris and Greenwich Village; so can you!
Hang pictures on fences or clotheslines, or prop them against
a convenient wall. The art work in this type of Show is fre-
quently priced for purchase if the exhibitors are interested
in selling their work. Some of the artists may be on hand
during the show to make sketches, pen and ink drawings, or
silhouettes of passers-by for a small fee.

I f You Have a Recreation Hall or some other apprOpriate,
large room at your disposal you can give a show in which
all groups, or individuals in one age group, such as golden-
agers, are invited to participate. You will need committees
for: clean up; decorating; entertainment and program; ex-
hibits and entries; location, equipment, and floor manage-
ment; publicity and, possibly, finance; reception; refresh~
ments; transportation—depending upon how elaborate your
show is to be.

Be sure to secure plenty of advance publicity. Such a
show entails lots of work and deserves a large audience—
make sure that the whole town knows about it through news-
papers, radio, and television broadcasts, posters, throwa-
ways, word-of—mouth advertising. Urge everyone to “talk
it up.”

If awards are to be given, the judging should be held at
the beginning of the show, so that the exhibitors may have
the satisfaction of displaying their prizes, and spectators will
recognize the exhibits which were considered outstanding.

Although you cannot guarantee the safety of any of the
exhibited articles, every precaution against damage or loss
must be taken. Many of the exhibits may have considerable
intrinsic value and all of them are precious to their owners
—they must be protected in transit and while they are on
display.

Learn By Experience

Don’t attempt to put on a city-wide or company-wide hob-
by show until you have held several smaller shows—for in-
dividual hobby clubs, perhaps—and have some experience
to guide you. Send for the National Recreation Association’s
booklet, Planning for Success—Hobby and Art and Craft
Shows, P66, 5.25. It contains more detailed information
about the types of shows mentioned here, including: duties
of committees; suggested hobby classifications; ways of dis-
playing exhibits; program suggestions. It deals primarily
with community and playground hobby shows, but many of
these ideas will be equally useful in planning shows for other

groups.

Start Your Planning for Your Hobby Show Today. It will
stimulate increased activity among the hobby groups, en-
courage more pe0ple to take up hobbies of their own, gener-
ate friendliness among the individuals, increase understand-
ing and neighborlincss inilhe community, he a tremendous
source of pleasure and satisfaction to the hobbyists who
would like their work displayed!

ORGANIZE

A SPRING
TOP SPINNING

CONTEST

 

Top-spinning, the age-old spring fa-
vorite, can be used for exciting group
contests, with elimination contests held
between individuals within the group——
in the center or on the playgrounds —
and bang-up linals of city-wide propor-
tions; or it can be an activity for indivi-
dual competition within one group,
club, or social center.

No matter what sort of competition
you plan, announce your events early
and give contestants time for practice.
If your tournament is to be city-wide,
hold elimination contests in each age
classification. Some communities set
them up according to midgets, juniors,
and intermediates. You will iind, how-
ever, that trick and stunt top-spinning
will appeal to older boys and girls. Even
fathers might be interested in getting
into the act. Your craft groups can make
their own tops and compete within their
own group. In any case, make a big
event of the finals—either within the
city or within the group. Judges are
needed for stunts of skill.

How to Spin 3 Thrown-Top1

Two things are necessary to spin a
top—a tight, evenly wound string and
a proper throw so that the top lands
peg down on the ground. In winding the
string, grasp the top with the thumb
firmly pressed on cord as shown in F ig-
ure 1 and start winding at the collar of
the peg. Wind round and round until
the cord is used up, being careful not
to overlap and to keep the cord tight
at all times. EXperience will determine
the length of cord to use. If the cord is

ning Contest, a free leaflet published by the

too long it will tangle as it will not be
completely unwound when the top hits
the ground. If too short, you will not
get sufficient spin. A button is knotted
onto the other end of the cord and then
is slipped between the first and second
fingers to keep the string attached to
the hand after the throw.

There are many ways of holding a top
and of throwing it, but the basic princi-
ple is the same. The top must land on the
ground with the peg down. It can be
thrown underhand or overhand. The
peg can be held in many positions and
the top thrown either straight or with
a twist of the wrist. One way is shown
in Figure 2 where the throw is over-

hand and aimed out in front of the play-
er about three feet (not straight down).
The ~top is held with the forefingers on
the flat part of the top and the thumb
on the peg. The string will tend to swing
the peg in towards the player and in the
direction it unwinds so the top should
be inclined enough to compensate for
this and make the top land peg down.
Generally speaking, an overhand throw
gives more force and longer spins. A
second method of spinning is shown in

Figure 3.

Finger Tops
There are many kinds of tops, of
course, and a great variety among hand-
made ones. One of the simplest of the
latter is that made by whittling a Spool

with a ackknife.
The secret of worksmanship in top-

 

making lies in perfect proportion and
balance. The length and diameter of
the spindle must be ust right in propor-
tion, and it must fit snugly. Tops can
be beautiful if the wood is sanded and
polished or painted. Bright contrasting
‘ colors are not lost in the Spinning.

Terminology

As in other games, top-spinning has
its own language. The top that is thrown
is the plugger. Your opponent’s top is
bait when you are trying to strike it out
of the ring. When a top stands perfectly
erect and apparently motionless while
spinning it is asleep — or a sleeper—
while a gigler is a top that dances and
bounces about. A top that ceases to spin
is a dead t0p.

Events

Many games and stunts in which tops
are used can be invented. Let contest-
ants use their own ingenuity. The fol-
lowing are a few old stand-bys to start
you off:

Longest Spinning. Top is timed for
length of Spin. All players start at given
signal.

MARCH 1955

Accuracy Put. Draw five concentric
circles with the bull’s-eye one foot in
diameter and each ring six inches wide,
making a target five feet in diameter.
Circles are numbered from the outside
to the bull’s-eye, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each
contestant is allowed five puts and is
scored according to the circle in which
his top hits. The top must spin after hit-
ting.

Top Scatter. Six dead tops are ar-

 

ranged peg up in the bull’s-eye of your
five concentric circles and each player
is given three throws at them with no
rearranging between puts. This time,
however, the rings are numbered from
the center out with the outside circle
number 5. The score is according to the
circles into which the tops are scattered.
The spinner’s top must remain spinning
after each throw. A top resting on the
line counts for the higher score ring.

T op-Killing. Each player gets three
tries at a live target top which is kept
spinning by one of the waiting contest-_
ants. Three points are given for a glanc-
ing blow, five points for “killing” the
bait top and ten points for splitting it.
Contestants’ tops must spin after hit-
ting.

Whip for Distance. Each contestant
throws a top from a given line. .‘Three
tries are allowed, the winners being
scored in accordance with the distance
farthest from the throwing line at which
their tops spin.

Taps and Marbles Game.2 A paddle is
used for picking up the Spinning top in
this game. Whittle paddle from soft
piece of wood, about two-and-one-half-
inches wide by twelve-inches long; and
shape according to sketch. A spinning
top can easily be picked up and set down
while it is still spinning with this type
of paddle.

Each player puts a number of marbles
into a common pool to form a pile of

Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1940.

 

twelve. These pooled marbles are ar-
ranged close together in the middle of
a twelve-inch ring drawn with chalk on
the ground. The first player spins his
top with a cord in the regular way, then
picks the top up with the paddle and
lets it fall, while Spinning, into the pile
of marbles in the ring. The revolving
top will knock several of the marbles
from the ring, which then belong to the
player whose top knocked them from
the ring.

The other players follow in turn, pick-
ing up and setting down their spinning
tops in the marble ring with their pad-
dles, trying, of course, to knock some
marbles from the ring with their revolv-
ing tops. When a top dies it is picked
up, spun again, scooped on the paddle
and placed, in turn, in the marble ring
so that it will knock out more marbles.
The game continues until all marbles
have been knocked from the ring.

Tricks and Stunts

Many of these consist of picking up
a spinning top on the palm of the hand
and performing a variety of feats with
it, the contestants taking turns—each
making one Spin each turn. These can
be left somewhat to the ingenuity of the
player.

Pick-ups. Some of the more usual
are: tossing Spinning top in air and
catching it on palm of hand, trans-
ferring it to palm of the other hand,
transferring it to back of same hand,
transferring it to back of other hand,
catching it on index finger, transferring
it to other fingers, catching it on thigh,
back, t0p of head, back of head and
other variations.

Fancy Looping. Judges are needed
here, for the contestant is graded on the
performance and difhculty of the vari-
ous loops. Length of time must be con-
sidered, for some contestants may make
several misses. A few ofthe most popu-
lar loops are: overhead, back, under the
leg and around the body loop. Many
others can be developed. All loops are
snapped from the ground and caught on

the palm of the band.

Secretaries in public recreation departments are like the
shoemaker’s children who often have to go barefoot! They
know all that’s going on—but never see it. They schedule
games and picnics—but never see a game or go to the pic-
nic. They write up reports, keep records, answer the phone
and do a thousand and one jobs that the department couldn’t
do without—but everything goes on around them, not with
them.

Last year the Public Recreation Association of New Jersey
came up with a wonderful idea. When it held its monthly
meeting in Maplewood, New Jersey, in May, all secretaries

were invited. More than that, a special workshop for them
was part of the program.

Result? They felt as though they were a real part of their
department. They learned new skills. They met the other
secretaries and could talk shop to understanding ears. They
had fun!

When you plan training sessions or workshops in or near
your home base, couldn’t you plan a similar program for the
secretaries? It will pay off in a better understanding of their
job, increased skills, and higher morale.

The invitation to the Maplewood workshop ran like this:

HIS SUMMER some child will see his

first butterfiy. Another will hear the
hoot of an owl for the first time. Others,
who didn’t think they could make any-
thing, will find they can build a rope
bridge or make a woven belt. All over
this country thousands of children are
looking forward to the fUn and excite-
ment of camping. N o matter what their
family income, race, or religion, they’ll
gain a sense of belonging, self-respect,
and achievement—and have a whale of
a good time doing it. This summer may
bring disappointment, too, of course;
for some boys and girls who look for-
ward to camp may not have the opportu-
nity to go.

Every group of six to eight children
in camp should have an adult counselor
whose understanding and enthusiasm
can help make the experience of camp-
ing as wonderful as the anticipation.
Despite the number of experienced
counselors who also look forward to
camp each season, new ones must join
them to insure a place for every child.

In every state counselors are needed
in camps sponsored by national non-
profit agencies for boys and girls, fami-
lies, and adults. Staff positions in these
camps offer opportunities for service
while earning a salary and gaining ex-
perience that can come in handy all year
round. Teachers, students, men and wo-
men from many fields, find that in seek-
ing to arouse the curiosity and interest
of the campers they themselves discover

new wonder in the world of animals,
plants, trees, rocks, clouds, and stars.

Camp staff members can also prac-
tice their hobbies and at the same time
prepare themselves for advancement in
their own fields. A teacher of an “in-
door” subject like art, history, or math
may want to prepare herself to take part
in the new school-camping program. A
nurse —— newly graduated, experienced,
even retired—may like working with
small groups of children and participat-
ing in other parts of the camp program.
A dietitian or home economics major
may want to broaden her experience in
managing all parts of a food program,
including outdoor cooking methods and
menus. The goals of the waterfront di-
rector may include improved teaching
and administrative skills.

Men and women with recent counsel-
ing experience know that most camps
emphasize an understanding of the pro-
gram as a whole rather than expertness
in a specific field. Primary aims of all
camp activities are increased self-reli-
ance and ability to live and work harmo-
niously with others. Democratic plan-
ning is encouraged by dividing large
groups into small units where counsel-
ors and campers can work together at a
tempo to suit everyone. More and more,
too, camps are replacing the sports and
games available in town with activities
based on the resources of the camping
location.

Though required qualifications in age
and experience vary for specific coun-
seling positions, the American Camping
Association, a professional organization
of camp administrators and camp di-

rectors, has recommended certain stand-
ards. The minimum age is nineteen,
with two years of college desirable. In
addition to skill in the specific respon-
sibilities assigned, the counselor must
enjoy outdoor living, have maturity,
good judgment, and sympathy with the
aims of the sponsoring organization.
Nurses, dietitians, and some specialists
should have administrative experience
as well. Assistants with required quali-
fications may begin at age eighteen.
Some camps have a counselor-in-train-
ing program for sixteen and seventeen
year olds.

The camp director must be twenty-
five years or over and have had at least
two years staff experience in an organ-
ized summer camp. In addition, the di-
rector should have a college degree or
equivalent educational background and
experience in administration and super-
vision of personnel.

Salaries vary with the individual’s ex-
perience, qualifications, and training, as
well as the location of the camp and the
length of the season. (Some positions
in day camps where the campers return
home each night are volunteer.)

Fun with Skits, Stunts and Stories

Helen and Larry Eisenberg. Associa-
tion Press, 291 Broadway, New York
7. Pp. 256. $2.95.*

The 30,000 purchasers of their last

book (publisher’s figures), will be glad
to know that the Eisenbergs have done
it again! Hot off the press (March 14)
their new book follows the Handbook
of Skits and Stunts with additional sug-
gestions for social recreation groups,
meetings, private parties, camps, school
groups, chapel programs, and so on.
The new material includes humorous
stories as' well. The authors say, “For
many years we have had gratifying suc-
cess with the use of humorous stories
to be read aloud, so we recommend
them to you.” Some of these are done
in Spoonerism style or in German dia-
lect, such as “Reddish Riden Hood”——
and are very funny. Others are adapted
for group participation.

Suggestions are given for a wide va-
riety of uses for skits and stunts, such
as in honoring people, promotion pur-
poses, celebration of birthdays, illustra-
tion and solving of group problems, fun
at the dining table in camp, during
meeting or conference recesses, to name
a few. The stunts themselves are full of
new ideas and materials.

Recreation leaders of groups should
not be without this book.

Publicity in Action

Herbert M. Baus. Harper & Brothers,
49 East 33rd Street, New York 16. Pp.
335. $4.505“

This is an excellent new handbook
which belongs in the working library of
every enterprising public or private
agency, civic organization, volunteer
group or charitable agency which must
tell its story and move people to action.
The author starts with a clarification of
terms, makes clear the differentiation
between publicity and public relations
and explains promotion, propaganda,
advertising, 'and goes on to deal with
publicity as an essential not only for
business but for such organizations as
listed above. He discusses each step in
the planning and effective placement of
publicity, and surveys the uses of news-
papers, magazines, radio, TV motion

144

Covering the Leisure-time Field

pictures, direct mail campaigns, and
display materials. The means of de-
veloping word-of-mouth publicity are
gone into; and throughout the book
practical examples are used to illustrate
the specific application of techniques.

In his preface, Mr. Baus says, “If
there is a secret in publicity, it lies in
having enough energy, organizing abil-
ity, and powers of self-expression to
employ in any given situation the de-
sirable combination of techniques which
men have devised and tested for com-
municating, and effectively applying
them toward the achievement of an ob-
jective.”

Committee Common Sense .

Audrey R. and Harleigh B. Trecker.
William Morrow and Company, Inc.,
425 Fourth Avenue, New York 16. Pp.
158. $2.50.

For those who are involved in group
activity—in business, government,
school, clubs, community organizations
-—these well-known authors offer the
why, who, when, what, and how of
committee operations, and answer the
many questions that come up in regard
to them. How do we appoint a com-
mittee, get the right people for the right
job? What are the qualifications of the
committee chairman? What are his re-
sponsibilities? How can we guarantee
good attendance and make every meet-
ing productive, and so on? The book
is filled with pointers on how to avoid
the frustrations of badly organized and
improperly run committees.

Through the Maghifying Glass

Julius Schwartz. McGraw-Hill Book
Co., Inc., 330 West 42nd Street, New
York 36. Pp. 142. $2.50.* '

This little book is brimming with
fascinating information and drawings
which can introduce a child to a whole
new world. It shows how, with an in-
expensive magnifying glass, you can see
such things as the fantastic faces of in-
sects, the flashes of exploding atoms,
how crystals grow into their perfect
shapes, why it is hard to counterfeit
money, and so on.

The author has taught science in the
public schools for the last twenty-five

years. He is senior author of the book-
let Adventures in Biology, which is used
by the New York City schools. His first
book for young readers, It’s Fun to
Know Why, is still popular.

Developing YMCA Iieaders for
Physical Education Service

Association Press, 291 Broadway,
New York 7. Pp. 84. $2.50.*

This is a manual for the leader of
leaders, prepared especially for the paid
physical director who must give lead-
ership to volunteer leaders. The YMCA
is a leader among the national move-
ments in the effective use of volunteers.
For every employed secretary there are
seventy-five laymen in volunteer service.

The manual, although oriented in the
YMCA, will be a helpful guide to lead-
ers in other types of agencies. The em-
phasis is on the responsibility and duty
of the physical director for selecting,
training and using lay leaders. There is
interesting criteria here for analyzing
and rating one’s self as a leader of lead-
ers. Also, there are helpful suggestions
on the selection, training and supervi—
sion of volunteers. Two special plans
for the development of leaders are out-
lined: (1) the club organization plan,
and (2) on the job training. Subjects
and course content are suggested, and
samples of how to develop topics, sea-
son’s training program, and suggestions
for the leader’s personal resource book
are given.

Many forms of recognition are in-
cluded and devices for motivation are
suggested, such as: uniforms, insignia,
emblems, pins, cards, annual picture,
certificates, citations, dinners, socials
and special meetings. Methods of ex-
pressing appreciation and the presenta-
tion of awards in recognition of volun-
teer service are dealt with in considera-

ble detail. The manual should be helpful

to students in training and professional
personnel using volunteer leadership.—

tion Personnel Service, NRA.

And when the young lady at the controls
thought the engineer wasn’t looking, she
opened up the throttle another notch.

She was Nellie Bly, reporter for the New

to reach Jersey City and beat a fictional
man in a trip around the globe. The man’s
name was Phileas Fogg, phlegmatic Eng-

And beat him she did—in just over 72
days—with only one dangerous incident.
A “titled cad” tried to flirt with her in the
middle of the Indian Ocean, but even he
subsided when she threatened to signal
the nearest U. S. man-of—war.
