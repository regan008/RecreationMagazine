73! ONE generation.

our living condi-

so materially that

k.

our ancestors of a
hundred years ago
would be appalled if
they were ahle to re-
1m to our world and see it as it is

 

Jtlay.

The brains of our present civilization
ale invented ways to travel by sea,
her the earth, and through the air at
speed beyond the imagination of our
trefathers.

The invention of our communication
.‘sicms—with telephone, telegraph, ra-
i0 and television—has made us a close
cighhor to all people all over the world.

The invention of our motion picture
mohines and the deve10p1nent of our
Lotion picture theatres have changed,
1 0110 gcneration, the need to satisfy
ur instinctive urge for music and
rama through individual effort. "

The many recent household mechani-
I1 dcvices to simplify work in the home
ave saved time, labor, and have also re-
laced much of the necessity for crea-
ve endeavor.

Our generation may be characterized
y motion, speed, noise and mechani-
ally operated activities.

Thc brains of our present civilization
avc also discovered how to cure many
f the ills which were, in past genera-
.ons. bcyond control. Important dis-
oVeries are made yearly in new meth-
ds of medical treatment. Longevity
as been extended almost fifty per' cent
[1 one gcneration.

Probably the most important discov-
ry of all time is how to split the atom
nd how atomic energy can be released
or use by man.

All frontiers on the surface of the
arth have been reached and man is
10W exploring the bottom of the sea and
he extent of the universe.

Those frontiers will also be reached

)ElBER 1953

and new frontiers will be sought.

While man is inventing new ways to
make possible release from physical
effort, new methods to cure ills, and
seeking new frontiers to conquer, he is
neglecting the exploration of his crea-
tive and spiritual needs. He is ignor-
ing the strain of the many changes sud-
denly placed on his nervous system.

Mechanical inventions have provided
us with leisure before we have learned
how best to use it.

What are the results? The mental
hospitals are filled to capacity and new
ones are required. The use of narcot-
ics has increased and alcoholism is not
an unusual condition.

Our newly found leisure offers a
threat—and a hope. We do not know
which way our leisure hours may takc
us—to new joys and to new heights of
happiness and attainment, or to roads
that spell defeat for ourselves and for
We cannot predict
what the future may hold, but we do
know that our society has the power
itself to determine what the
course will be. The course that is open
is education—education for leisure.

Research and experimentation in so-

our civilization.

within

cial fields are just as important as re-
search and experimcntation in indus-
trial, commercial and scientific fields,
and warrant like consideration.

Recreation is the balance wheel in the
transition from our old to our new way
of life and has much to do with the
growth, development, and the future
welfare, of our civilization. The machine
must become the servant of man.

How can each city and town provide
the opportunity for the fulfillment of its
investment for the future—in its citi-
zens’ leisure time?

The answer may be found in well
kept, attractive, recreation centers, for
all age groups, as free as possible from
mechanical noises and confusion of the
streets; centers where a quiet, restful
atmosphere of cleanliness, order, sys-

Joseplline D. Randall

tern and beauty abides; where all feel at
home and all feel relaxed; centers
where the little child, the adolescent,
the adult and the senior citizen have
opportunity to participate in physical
and creative activities as interests dic-
tate; centers where leadership is avail-
able for all interested in arts, crafts,
dramatics, music and sports, and where
all share in responsibility.

When playgrounds and recreation
centers were first considered a proper
function of government, the activities
available were largely for children. It
soon became apparent that Opportuni-
ties for a well-rounded program of ac-
tivities had to be made available for
adolescents too. As the adolescent be-
came an adult it was a natural sequence
that recreation opportunities were ex-
tended to young adults.

The results of our many inventions
and discoveries during the past dec-
ades made possible a longer life span,
and industrial and business agencies
were encouraged to require ari earlier
age for retirement. Thus our senior
citizens suddenly became heir to good
health, long life, and to many enforced
hours of leisure. If habits and interests
for constructive leisure-time activities
have been formed during childhood
and young adulthood, the hours spent
by our senior citizens during their free
time will be a great asset to the com-
munity. But if the community has not
had the foresight to make provision for
the proper use of the free time'of all its
people, young and old, the waste to so-
ciety and to social progress will be in-
excusable and will be a blot upon our
future civilization.

The answer lies in the years ahead;
but the responsibility lies in the course
the community chooses to take today.

tired from her position as superintend-
ent of recreation in San, Francisco.

From Other Lands
Sirs:

With great satisfaction I have re-
ceived your copies of the magazine,
RECREATION. You can’t imagine how I
am glad and grateful for your kindness
and helpfulness. These numbers came
just in time to be useful in our work.

As you have known, our job is to
create new citizens during thepourse of
recreation and sports work.

According to Mr. Rivers’ short pro-
gram here, he visited only one of our
“Social Sports Centers,” at Guiza, near
Cairo; but I am very sure that he would
have reached a more complete and
clearer opinion if he could have visited
the others of our playgrounds and
centers.

AMIN SADIK, General Inspector of
Physical Education, Department. of
Sports, Cairo, Egypt.

Sirs:

Thank you very much for the copies
of RECREATION which you recently sent
to us. They will be a valuable addition
to our magazine reference collection. In
fact we have had several questions in
the past few months which could have
been answered by articles listed in the
magazine; and we will no doubt have
more such questions.

The collection would be even more
useful if it would be possible to {ill in
some of the missing numbers. Do you
think that some of your members or
readers would have back files which
they would be willing to part with in
such a worthy cause? I am enclosing
a list of the numbers that are lacking,
just in case there might be someone able
to complete your generous gesture:

Suggestion from Layman
Sirs:

I believe that checker boards an
checkers should be available at all rel
reation places, or in city parks the
might have Checker Pavilions wil
tables at which men and women can e:
joy themselves.

Your organization could reach ci
officials to do this. They furnish gol
tennis, baseball, soccer, basketball, :
why not encourage checker games f1
youngsters and old people? It is a gre
and learned game and trains the min
and also is a great relaxation; and
breeds more friendships by seeing be
much we know or how little we knO‘
Girls learn checkers fast, being ve'
able players. Hope you can encoura;
this. in girls’ clubs and boys’ clubs at
fraternal organizations, and in ci
parks all over the nation. Boards cou
be painted on tables and checkers own:
by players.

Sports Motivation
nrs:

l have very closely studied Mr. Kel-
er’s article, “Sports Motivation” in the
ieptember issue of RECREATION, and
'au unreservedly say that I think it is
my well done and very timely. His
ubjcct touches upon something which
s very important to all of us, namely,
be using of every honorable means pos-
.ible to sell recreation and to stimulate
ts growth and acceptance. Many of us
It the field are dubbed “promoters”
111d, as he suggests, this term has too
ong had—in the minds of professional
)eople—an ugly connotation.

Perhaps I am very biased in favor of
HT. Keller and his theories because I
iavc always believed in the necessity of
notivation, having learned this when
studying to be a teacher, and having ap-
plied it ever since in the classroom, the
1thletic field, the camp playground and
community center. However, needless
to say I have gathered quite a reputa-
tion for being a “promoter, big opera-
tor. circus manager, and so on.” Mr.
Kellcr’s paper, in my opinion should
be compulsory reading and used for
study in every college recreation course
offered today. If there is any area of
recreation which needs proper motiva-

tion, development and supervision, it
certainly is*the field of community
athletics. Please note our statement:

* II * II .
Sirs:

Mr. Keller has brought out a number
of very helpful points in his article,
“Sports Motivation”; however, he has
omitted one excellent method of motiva-
tion. Sports participants should be
given many opportunities to assume re-
sponsibilities often carried by the adults
sponsoring the sports program. The
child can assist in many publicity areas,
in planning the programs, as well as in
the actual conduct of the games—in ad-
dition to his part as a player in these
activities. Many routine jobs can eagerly
be performed by players when not ac-
tive in the games.

KATHERINE W. MONTGOMERY, Direc-

tor of Physical Education for Women,

Florida State University, Tallahassee.

* * ‘I *
Sirs:

I believe Mr. Keller’s article is an ex-
cellent contribution to a recreation
worker’s check list of essential things
to do when one launches any selected
activity in an organized recreation pro-
gram. . . . The theme is clearly revealed
to the reader in paragraph three when
the writer refers to a “basic formula”
for planning any organized recreation
program. . . .

He should receive a big thank you
from his colleagues for assembling a
good list of elements for immediate
practical application in any on-going
situation and for discussions among
those who conduct training and in-serv-
ice training sessions.

Juvenile Delinquency

o In scores of cities, according to an
AP report, children are committing
more and worse crimes than at any time,
since World War II. In a survey of the
juvenile court records of many major
cities, it was found that: uvenile delin-
quency started to increase in many in
1948; the rate jumped in more cities
after the Korean outbreak; it is now
rising fast in many areas; if the rise
continues, it will soon reach the rate
of the World War II peak. The AP
pointed out that nearly all juvenile
court judges and social workers agreed
that home influences are a major factor
in juvenile delinquency and that “wars
tend to break up homes and create other
factors adverse to the welfare of chil-
dren.”

0 According to a report by The Com-
mittee on Public Health Relations, of
the New York Academy of Medicine,
the use of narcotics by adolescents re-
flects deprivations in cities rather than
a problem of moral degeneracy or fail-
ure of law enforcement. The report de-
clared that the adolescent uses narcotics
to compensate for lacks of recreation,
adequate social contacts, suitable em-
ployment and satisfactory living condi-
tions. But it was agreed that the mere
provision of better housing, more play-
grounds and teen-age clubs would not
solve the problem because only a small
percentage of the teen-age p0pulation
used narcotics as a compensating factor.

0 In New York State, Governor Dewey
signed a bill extending the New York
State Youth Commission until 1956.
This is a state agency working to pre-
vent juvenile delinquency. The juve-
nile delinquency rate in this state de-
creased slightly in 1952 over the pre-
ceding year.

0 A St. Lawrence University sociolo-
gist, Dr. Herbert A. Bloch, reports that
tension between parents in middle-class
homes is a prime factor in swelling the
number of emotionally disturbed delin-
quents—according to an announce-

ment in the New York Herald Tribune

in August. His statement was made at
the meeting of the fourth annual insti-

tute on delinquency and crime. Dr.
Bloch adds, “Children from_ poorer
homes often are delinquents but do not

266

necessarily show signs of emotional dis-
turbance.”

O Hearings on juvenile delinquency
will be held this fall by a Senate sub-
committee headed by Senator Hendrick-
son of New Jersey, according to news-
paper reports.

0 Publications on uvenile delinquency,
prepared as part of current campaign
for better services for delinquent chil-
dren, include: Some Facts About Juve-
nile Delinquency; What’s Happening to
Delinquent Children in Your Town?;
Helping Delinquent Children. Limited

Director, Special Juvenile Delinquency

Board Members

In-Service Training for School

Boards

It’s back to the classroom for school
board members in six southern Illinois
communities. Under a project conduct-
ed by the Midwest Administration Cen-
ter, at the University of Chicago and
Southern Illinois University, fifty mem-
bers of boards of education are taking a
year’s training to help them do a better
job. Field trips, group meetings at
Southern Illinois University, and visits
to public schools are included in the
program—along with outside reading
and homeworkI—Guirience Newsletter,

April 1953.

Your Recreation Board Members

Let’s face it—all of your recreation
board or commission members are not
aware of the full meaning of recreation
and some of them have no appreciation
of your efforts to improve your pro-
gram.

The recreation director naturally is
responsible for cducating his board and
keeping members up-to-date recreation-
wise. One of the very best ways to fulfill
this obligation is to invest a few dollars
in subscriptions to RECREATION maga-
zine, published by the National Recre-
ation Association, for every member of
your board or commission. See to it
that magazines are sent to their home
addresses and not to their offices. This

also gives the board member’s wife an:
family a chance to read RECREATIO‘.
and call special articles to his attention
which he in turn can call to your atten
tion. It should not make any differenc
to you if you have been trying to g6
the same idea across to him for the pas
year without success. This is one of th
surest and easiest methods of gettin
your board members interested in yo
and your program.———Parks and Recn
ation Newsletter, Tennessee Departmer
of Conservation. '

 

MOST INTERESTING SUGGES-
TION OF THE MONTH

RECREATION BOARDS—There

has been a great deal of discussion
about the function of recreation
boards, the number of members
and the duties of each. One solu-
tion to these problems might be to
divide their duties and make each
member responsible for one of the
established precepts which apply to-
success in any field.

For example, there would be one
member to keep his feet on the
ground, another to keep his ear to
the ground, and still another who'
would keep his head in the stars.
The duty of one would be to see that.
the executive kept his nose to the
grindstone, another to make sure
that he kept his hand on the wheel.
and another to see that he kept his
eye on the ball.

This would call for a board of six
members. If it seemed inadequate.
a seventh member could be appoint-
ed to keep his nose out of other peo-
ple's business—Anonymous.

o If anyone is interested, this is
said to be apropos of congress ses-
sions for board members—Ed.

The Need forALay Interest

ks PROFESSIONAL and lay workers in
the field of recreation, we are al-
ays interested in any current condi-
ons or changes which appear to be
ffecting, vitally, the progress and suc-
m of our efforts to provide recrea-
on opportunities in our communities.
ome of the things which occurred
uring the past calendar year have real
igiificance for those of us who are
ow planning and working for the fu-
ire. Some of these pertinent develop-
lents are particularly related to the
olc of the lay citizens in this field.

At the close of each year, the Na-
ional Recreation Association asks the
members of its field staff—which gives
ervice to morc than 2,200 communi-
ies in the eight districts covering the
'ntire country—to file with our na-
ioual office a report of the progress of
ureation developments in these vari-
)lfs localities, an'd to point up some of

muse some concern. At our national

grams, the competency of recreation
leadership and other important factors.
National staff workers uniformly and
repeatedly called attention to the sig-
nificant service being provided in
scores of communities throughout the
country by lay citizens; and they sup-
plied extensive evidence as to the im-
portance of such volunteer lay leader-
ship.

Their reports indicated that seventy-
seven communities in the country es-
tablished organized public recreation
programs for the first time during
1952, and that sixty-nine of the seven-
ty-seven communities provided a citi-
zens’ recreation board or commission
as the administering authority. In
forty-two instances these boards were
provided with legal power. The re-
ports also showed that, for the first
time in several years, tax support of
local recreation programs was leveling
off. Some places suffered actual cuts
in their budgets; and more calls came
to the association’s field workers, ask-
ing them to come in and assist with
efforts to prevent such reductions. By
comparison with previous years, fewer
communities held referendums on bond
issues and recreation levies, and a
higher percentage of those who did so
suffered defeat.

The reports indicated greater im-
provement in the extent and quality of
local recreation programs, with the

best provision being made for play-
grounds and sports programs. Many
local prOgrams are still weak on activi-
ties for girls and women, and for cer-
tain ad'ult-age groups including older-
age citizens. Too many departments
still do little or nothing to provide pro-
grams of community music, drama,
and arts and crafts. (The last activity,
however, is progressing more rapidly
than other cultural phases of the pro-
gram.) This condition is one of the
reasons why the National Recreation
Association, last year, appointed a Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Pro-
grams and Activities, and assigned a
member of the national staff to work
exclusively on developing appropriate
program materials for use by local rec-
reation departments and agencies.
The national field workers’ reports re-
vealed also that the vast majority of
communities still lag in, their provision
of qualified leadership. It is very evi-
dent that there are not enough leaders,
they are not sufficiently well qualified,
and many of them are working without
adequate compensation. The recrea-
tion movement lost, during 1952, a
number of top-notch professional lead-
ers. Some of them took up war emer-

gency assignments, and others left the
profession permanently for more lu-

crative positions in business and in-
dustry.’ Twenty-one such losses of
key recreation leaders occurred in two

267

of the major mid-western states alone.
In the Middle Atlantic District there

were nineteen during the year, and in
New England the loss was at the rate of
one each month.

Uniformly the reports indicated that,
in all the districts, the extension of
recreation areas and other types of fa-
cilities took place at a more rapid pace
than adequate funds could be provided
for their maintenance. Even more seri-
ously, programs and leadership serv-
ices are suffering as a result of ex-
penditures for upkeep of prOperties.

Those of you who are from small
communities, represent a group of lo-
calities and rural areas which are in-
creasingly active in trying to provide
new programs of recreation. Some of
you are reSponsible for operating pro-
grams on a county-wide basis. This is
another area of interest and promotion
in which recreation needs more and
better leadership—both from profes-
sional and from volunteer lay' lcaders.

During the past year or more, and
particularly during the recent national
political campaign, the general public
was highly charged with reports of
waste in government, and with appeals
to economize and to reduce taxes. It is
inevitable that such propaganda, so in-
tensely projected into the public mind,
should find expression in terms of lo-
cal efforts to reduce recreation hudgets,
programs and personnel. Adequate
provision of such tax funds and service,
and the desired authorization of morc
bond issues and special recreation lev-
ies, are the responsibility of our lay
citizens as voters in the community.
In the last analysis, their intercst and
attitude are the determining factors.

In the early 1930’s when the full im-
pact of the econoinic recession brought
se’vere reductions in tax expenditure
for recreation programs and services,
the' National Recreation Association
made a study of what was happening
in a great many communities through-
out the country, particularly to see if
there was any direct relationship be-
tween the type of administering au-
thority that existed in these commu-
nities, and what was happening to the
recreation program. It was found that,
in those communities where public rec-

reation was administered by a board
of lay citizens, or especially by an offi-
cial recreation board or commission,
recreation suffered less financial loss,
lost fewer leaders, and maintained its
program of activities and facilities on
a much more normal level than did
those cities with other types of admin-
istering authorities.

In time of trouble it has always paid
to carry the consideration of recrea-
tion to key lay citizens, even when
they may not have seemed favorable
at the moment. Recently, the public
recreation department in an important
mid-western city requested a substan-
tial increase in its budget for the cur-
rent year. It was learned that the Tax
Payers'Association, a powerful group
in this community, was opposed to any
increases in the local municipal service.
The recreation authorities in this com-
munity took their budget to thc tax
payers group, .explained the need for
the increase, and asked them to review
it and study the recommendations. The
group did so, and members latcr re-
ported that they thought the increase
requested was needed. Furthermore, a
representative of their group appeared
before the local city council in support
of the increase, which was granted.

At the present time, the national
leaders in the education field are mak-
ing an unprecedented effort to have
members of local school boards better
informed regarding their duties, the
problems they face, and their respon-
sibilities as board members. The Na—
tional Citizens Commission for Public
Schools is spearheading this endeavor.
It is interesting that the University of
Southern .Illinois has been conducting,
during this past year, a special train-
ing course for school board members.*

The National Associa-
tion, recognizing the growing require-

special attention, through the national
board and the national staff, to this

the heading of a feature story in the Chicago Daily
News in May, 1952. It concerned Aage Paulsen, Waukegan,
Illinois. playground and recreation board member, who
spearheaded a community project which resulted in a badly

needed fieldhouse in one of the city‘s oldest and most

'used parks.

When Paulsen said he believed the building could be se-
cured by contributions of materials and labor, even his own
father said he was “off his rocker.” While a few local
projects had been accomplished, the majority had died for
lack of support. However, after a year and eight months
of intensive work, the fine building, twenty feet by thirty feet,
containing an activity room, fireplace, toilets and heat-
ing plant. was formerly dedicated, on July 20, 1952; and it
stands as a monument to a man who had faith in himself
and above all, faith in the generosity of his fellow towns-
man.

l’rcvious promoters of civic projects had made appeals
for moncy on the basis of estimated cost. Paulsen used a
new approach which is most certainly the secret of his
success.

Through the local paper, the \Vauk‘egan News-San, he
announced the project and his intention to depend on con-
tributions of labor and materials. .011 the date stipulated
for thc start of the project he rounded up shovels, neigh-
borhood youngsters and adults, and dug the trench for

the foundation. From there on he built step by step, ask-

ing for those things most immediately needed. Through
literally yards of column inches generously accorded by
the News-Sun, by personal solicitations, and by letter, he
secured everything needed.

The trE-nch being dug, he asked for sand, cement, gravel,
mortar mix which he got for the foundation. Concrete
blocks were next and he got a few, most .of which turned
out to be corner blocks; but he and volunteers put up what
they had and issued a call for more. Naturally, it was not
easy, but the durable Dane kept doggedly at it, assisted
by a park neighbor, Clarence Cehrls whom Paulsen named
(to-chairman; and the building grew. Many promised and
then didn’t deliver, which slowed progress, but someone
always eventually came through. The gas company dug
trenches, the city street and water department dug up the
strect to hook into sewer and water mains. To make sure
that the workers never got thirsty, local bottling concerns
contributed case after case of free pop. It seemed that
Waukegan individuals and firms liked to have a definite
part in the construction, so materials and labor from ce-

269

ment and plastering contractors, plumbers and plumbing
supply houses, lumber yards, building contractors, excava-
tors, electrical supply firms and building supply houses——
while they didn’t exactly pour in—came in sufficient quan-
tities to meet immediate needs. Individual ‘electricians
promised but didn’t show up. A letter to the union, fortu-
nately received a day prior to a meeting, brought immedi-
ate reSponse. Roofing companies contributed remnants
from contract jobs, none of which alone was sufficient. So
they were assembled at one spot and two or three of the
proprietors created a pattern, using different remnants,
which is of real beauty. Nurseries contributed shrubs and
trees, and a feed house gave grass seed to build a new turf.
The Great Lakes Naval Training Station issued a pass to
their “dump,” and many usable items were salvaged. A
heating contractor completed the layout with a unit with a
retail value of about five hundred dollars.

Although Mr. Paulsen discouraged gifts of cash, as such,
individuals, firms, and organizations who had nothing to
contribute which could be used, participated by purchasing
something immediately needed. Therefore, the judges, the
mayor, lawyers and other professional men can point to
what their money bought. In all, 143 firms and individuals
contributed materials and 150 others contributed labor for
construction. Youngsters as young as eight years of age

got into the act, and one seventy-year-old grandmother

wielded a shovel. Even the plans were contributed by one
of the leading architects.
An estimated two thousand persons attended the dedica-

tion which featured a band concert, the best in entertain»
ment, and wound up with a dance on the blacktop all-purpose
play area, also donated by an asphalt construction firm.
All services were contributed and neighborhood women,
girls and men, prepared and handed outithousands of
sandwiches, dozens of cases of soft drinks, and carton after
carton of ice cream bars, most of which were donated by
loyal friends of the project. ‘

Too much credit cannot be given to Aage Paulsen, quot-
ing State Conference delegates, “whose smile shines out
like a light.” Those who know him well know that he will
give the shirt off his back to anyone who needs it more.
‘Whenever the county judge needs a temporary foster home
for some unfortunate boy he calls Aage, who never turns
him down. The amount of compensation barely covers
food, and as clothes are usually needed, Paulsen and his
attractive wife Bernice cut somewhere to supplement. He
is always first in line to come to the assistance of his fellow
man in need, and his civic achievements are many.

Since completion of the building, there has been no
vandalism. Neighborhood youngsters whom Paulsen la-
beled his “labor battalion” will probably see to it that
there isn’t any. They put in too many hours of work to
want to see it destroyed.

In some cities, getting a park fieldhouse would probably
mean very little. In Waukegan it is a major achievement.
It will stand for many years as a monument to Paulsen.
but also as a concrete evidence that, given a good cause,

American people continue to be generous. God bless them.

RECREATION

Mrs. Raymond E. Murphy

WOT OFTEN does a woman have the opportunity to see the
provisions of her Last Will and Testament carried out.
But that is just what has happened to Miss Dora E. Dodge,
director of the Worcester, Massachusetts, Girls Club. Sev-
eral years ago Miss Dodge wrote a pamphlet entitled “I Give
and Bequeath,” in which she expressed her wishes for Amer-
ican girls. It was printed in 1938 by the National Recrea-
tion Association under the title “Her Rightful Heritage,”
and has since then been widely circulated.

After bequeathing many good things to girls, Miss Dodgc
made a final bequest. “Item: Since I do not have wealth to
bestow, save only understanding, I dedicate to little girls

'ho do not have these things a lifelong effort to establish
inewhere a clubhouse, equipped to supplement the homes

   
   

l our city to meet this need as I know it. I would hope
1erein to suggest what could happen to a nation if it once
ecame aware of the wealth and power that lies dormant in
- potential motherhood.” Now, after, fifteen years,ithe
Worcester Girls Club has a brand new clubhouse, equipped
to supplement the homes of the city.

This fine new building, which has cost the citizens of
Worcester more than $700,000, did not result from dreams
alone. lt took hard work and skillful planning on the part
of many people. A group of civic minded folk worked to-
ward this end for many years. Mrs. Clifford Anderson has
given more than thirty years to this service, and Mrs. J.
llerbert Johnson has worked with the Girls Club for a simi-
lar period. Many of Worcester’s men have been equally in-
terested, giving both time and advice as it was needed. But
in a larger sense, the new clubhouse is really a community
project made possible because many citizens believed in it
and were willing to work for it. The Worcester Girls Club
is. of course. one of the Community Chest affiliates and owes
much to its hacking and support.

The new clubhouse is particularly interesting to recrea-
lion people because it eXpresses Miss Dodge’s philosophy of

what a girls club should mean to the community. It is a
modern brick, glass and stone building, set on a hill in one
of Worcester’s most congested districts. Hundreds of girls
live within easy walking distance, and hundreds more can
reach it by bus.

The building is L-shaped, the left-hand wing housing the
auditorium with its stage, cloak rooms, and dressing rooms.
There is a place to store scenery and a room for costumes,
and, above all, there are workshops where costumes and
scenery can be made and rooms where classes in drama can
he held. These classes do not limit themselves to preparation
for big productions only. There are daily classes in story
telling and story dramatization, informal classes that give
little girls an opportunity to develop their hidden, and often
thwarted, desire to pretend they are someone else.

There is a lounge and snack bar, and near at hand are the
offices that house the director and her staff. The right end
of the main wing contains a 60-foot swimming pool and two
sets of locker rooms. This arrangement provides for pos-
sible use of the pool by boys when occasion demands, which
illustrates an interesting point of view maintained by the
Worcester Girls Cluh. Girls, particularly teen-age girls, are
not interested in isolation, but in real life conditions in
which boy’s activities and girl’s activities are blended. Hos-
pitality is one of the dearest needs of girls.

Behind the pool and its locker rooms is a large gymna-
sium. Here games are played, not only athletics, but musi-
cal and singing games and dancing. And speaking of danc-
ing, provision has been made to have dances that boys as
well as girls may attend in the auditorium. Not far from
the gym is a game room where ping-pong tables, and the
like, can be found.

The second floor houses the domestic arts. There are sew-
ing-rooms, a music-room, a library, kitchens, dining-room,

and a laundry. Here classes are held in the housewifely arts, '

classes that are informal and good fun. Here little girls
learn to heconie housewives and mothers. There is a nurse
to teach them baby care, with dolls for the younger girls
and real hot water bottles and clinical thermometers for the
older ones. The instruction is practical, down to earth train-
ing that has proved its usefulness in many a Worcester
home.

In this way the dream is being fulfilled. The clubhouse is
a place where a girl may learn to be proud of the job she
will do as a wife and a mother, where she may learn some
of the finer things of life as well as the practical.

United Nations Day—October 24, 1953

Do not overlook United Nations Day in your town, and
This should be

other program activities, throughout the year, which will
bring about a better understanding of the peoples of other
nations. We have learned that nations cannot live in isola-

tion in a world grown smaller through modern means of
transportation and communication. We must become better
acquainted and learn to plan together if we are to live in
peace and steer a wise course in a world of complex inter-
national relationships.

A Few Program Suggestions

1. International Bazaar—Have you any nationality groups
in your town? If so, why not consider the organization of
booths and programs sponsored by these groups—and fund-
raising tables, with the proceeds to go to the International
Children’s Fund, or another UN relief agency. Promote co-
operation of groups.

2. The Community Center—Plan a center program which
will display or introduce handcrafts, paintings, clothing,
cooking, dancing, music of nationality groups. Highlight
special UN Day projects. Let your art groups contribute
UN Day posters, decorations. '
3. UN Day Dance—Use an international theme. Include
some folk dancing. Some prominent person might be asked
to speak briefly on the UN.

4. UN Day Parties—Invite visitors from other countries,
wherever possible, and encourage questions about customs
in other lands. Include their games, dancing, costumes.

5. Games—Learn and play simple games played by chil-
dren in other countries.

6. UN Sing—Have a folk song festival. Prepare new lyrics
to old favorites so that everyone will know the tune. Teach
a few songs from other countries. Include a specially-cre-
ated UN choral presentation.

7. UN Quiz—Stimulate members of teen-age and senior
groups to prepare quizes related to UN activities and have
several young people together participate in answering.

Hockey in India

India has been the world’s hockey champion five times
in a row. She won the championship first in 1928 at Am-
sterdam, Holland, by a score of 28-0, followed by victories
in 1932 at Los Angeles, in 1936 at Berlin, in 1948 at Lon-
don, and in 1952 at Helsinki, Finland.

There are many reasons for the popularity of this game
in India and for her consistent world championship record.
The Indian climate is suited for hockey the year around,
and it is an inexpensivc sport. A branch of a tree and a
medium-sized stone will do for equipment and even two
persons can form opposing teams. A special playing field
is not necessary either, and throughout the country—in
villages and towns—one can see young and old joining in
the game, much as baseball is played on sandlots in the
US. and cricket on the village greens in England.

One of the most popular presents to children, in India,
is a hockey stick. The game is universally played in schools

and colleges, and there are few educational institutions
without a hockey field. Where there is none, boys do not
hesitate to trespass on the adjoining ground. Just as the
ambition of American small boys is to be a big-leaguer,

clubs in the country.

Dhyan Chand, India’s captain at the Berlin Olympiad,
earned the title, “Wizard of the East,” by his excellent stick-
work. His partner was his brother, Hoop Chand. When
those two were on the field, the opposition scarcely got
near the ball. The two brothers, un-agitated and without
strain InonopOlized it between themselves—and the scoring,
too.

On bcing asked by newsmen in European and Asian
capitals to explain their magic, they simply replied, “It is
not magic. It is the combination of a supple wrist, quick
foot-work and a keen eye for the ball.”

In the Helsinki finals the Indian team was on t0p from
the beginning of the game. Before five minutes were up.
Balbir, the center forward, had scored a goal. At half-
time he had piled up three more.

Cairo, Egypt

In the course of recreation and sports work in Cairo,
Egypt, it is our job to look after the youth outside of school
hours, and army personnel in their leisure-time——from
sports and social points of view. Therefore our daily pro-
gram begins in the afternoons and continues through the
evenings.

Our membership, for which no fee is charged, is con-
fined to workers and the poorer classes of population only;
and all of our sports centers are localized in the middle-
class and poor areas.

We began in 1942 with only one center; now we have
nineteen, scattered throughout Egypt. Every sports center
consists of basketball field, volleyball field, ring for weight-
lifting, carpet for wrestling, ping pong table and set, and——
in some centers—a complete football playground, with ad-
joining rooms, lockers and baths. Our aim is to establish
one center or more in every district and town! However,
the lack of money and leaders is the main problem.

We started with only thirty boys; now we have 2,500 in-
cluding those from twelve to sixteen and young men from
sixteen to twenty-five. We are concerned with their physi-
cal, moral and social welfare, although up to the present,
physical culture has been the basis of our work.

Our program includes the well-known games: basketball,
volleyball and ping pong, for boys: weight-lifting, wrest-
ling, football (soccer), for young men only. Special
gymnastic tables are compulsory and one of the principal
requirements for participation in the competitions. In ad-
dition to all of these, music, drama and camping are offered.

During the last sports season, we held a special tourna-
ment for our social sports centers in: gymnastics (mass
work), basketball, volleyball, ping pong, drama and music
——for both boys and young men; weight-lifting, wrestling
and football, for young men only. Up to now (June 16,
1953), we already have finished seventy-three matches, with
650 participants. Our season will be finished on June 26,
when a sports day for all finals will be held. Truly, we
now have well-trained boys and players of very high stand-
ard, in every game.—AMIN SADIK, General Inspector of
Physical Education, Department of Sports, Cairo, Egypt.

SELLING AMERICA
IN GERMANY

THIS IS THE report of a hobby that

grew into the serious business of
selling America.

I had come to Germany as a youth
activities specialist for the Office of
Military Government, in September,
1948. I had no idea that I would be
stationed in Bremen, a city of 420,000
people, and that this city, officially the
U. S. Zone of Occupation, would be
surrounded by the British Zone of Oc-
cupation. I had brought with me, how-
ever, 35 mm colored film slides of rec-
reation programs and facilities which
I had photographed in the United
States.

The first few weeks in Germany were
devoted to giving talks on youth and
sport work, generally; and then, a
small club requested a talk on life in
the United States. No specific topic
was suggested, and an illustrated pre-
sentation of “What the Audience-Could
Do in Their Leisure Time Were They

well suited for the group. The film
slides including scenes of Colorado,
Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New
Mexico, offered a Splendid opportunity
to show America’s outdoor programs
at their best.

The audience, therefore, visited Den-

a rodeo in action, the parks of Denver
and the children on the playgrounds.
A national basketball tournament was
shown in some detail. Next, they trav—

our vast system of national parks was
described. Native animals and nature

lore of this area were included. The
geysers, paintpots, hot springs, water-
falls, streams, lakes and canyons ap-
peared in all their glorious color. To
progress to Glacier National Park re-
quired but a change of a picture, and
then began a series of slides on moun-
tains and glaciers, lakes and gorgeous
mountain flowers. Emphasis was placed
upon the international boundary, with
Canada’s Waterton Park and the ded-
ication of the entire area as Waterton-
Glacier International Peace Park.
From Glacier National Park the au-
dience travelled to Grand Coulee Dam,
to Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, to
Mount Rainer, to the Olympic Penin-
sula, to Portland, Oregon, along the
Columbia River, down the Oregon
Coast and to San Francisco, California,
where again they saw many scenes of
young and old engaged in recreation.
They visited the riding academy, the
golf links, baseball fields and tennis
courts. Again and again the variety
and scope of American recreation was
impressed upon them—hardly describ-
able in words, but shown in color be-
fore their very eyes. To conclude the
show, they were taken to Salt Lake
City, where the Utah Centennial cele-
bration was in progress. They saw a
mammoth parade of gaily decorated
floats, automobile racing on the salt
flats and many sporting events. When
they came to the end of the trip, they

'were given the opportunity to ask

questions, of which the following are

but samples:

How long can one camp free of charge in
a national park?

How can so many people in a city smaller
than ours have so many more chances to play
without paying high prices?

Could I play tennis in that city without

belonging to a club?

Do factories in America have sports and
other leisure-time activities for workers?

Does every city have so many differenl
leisure-time activities in which boys and
girls can take part?

Who pays for all this recreation work?

The young people were vitally inter
ested in the side of American life whicl
was different from the scenes of tlu
Statue of Liberty, sky-scrapers of Nev
York and large number of automo
biles, that made up their common con
ception of the United States. Seeing
was believing, and they saw that Amer
ica had much to offer her citizens, ricl
or poor, young or old.

As an experiment the illustrated tall
was a success. The leading question
allowed for the full explanation o
community_recreation, the history 0
the formation of our country, the stru'
gles of territories to statehood and s

forth.

It resulted in a flood of request
for other showings of the same film
and of any others that were availabli

The fact that the talks were so we
received suggests that states, cities
schools, clubs and organizations in t}:
United States could send to German
sets of films and stories of their stat:

FES, SALARIES for the budget’s sake. You, the city man-
ager, mayor, councilman, board member, general pub-
b, do you want to conserve the budget? Would you like to
lake the recreation tax dollar go farther—buy more recre-

'on and better quality too?
50w don’t get too far ahead of me. I don’t mean cut
#ries; that is the last thing to do. I mean increase ’em
pd as fast as you can. Cheap leadership is the most ex-
epsive item in the budget. As trustees of other pe0ple’s
ioney, we should not permit such waste. Has not experi-
uhe taught that you get just about what you pay for? How
[out it, you folks who buy clothes, steel, lumber, wool,
domobilcs—isn’t that so? The same thing is true with per-

nel—you get only that for which you pay.

f course, I know that some of you have six- and seven-
nonsand dollar recreation executives to whom you are pay-
ifour and five thousand per ycar. Also that you are get-
' some of those supervisors and center directors for five
Imdred dollars to one thousand dollars less than what they
r. really worth.

But, is that playing fair with these experienced, hard work-
n! and loyal leaders? Does your city want something for
tolhing or more than it’s willing to pay for? Let’s put it
n tlier way. Is it good business or economically wise to
la well-qualified leaders a sub-standard salary? I doubt
t. For one thing, some more up-and-coming city will even-
udly discover these people, recognize their worth and show
.ppieciation in terms of an offer of really professional
alaries.

When that happens “turnover” of personnel begins and,
urnovcr is expensive. This can happen to your city if your
alary schedules are not up to standard. It has happened
0 other cities that have since admitted their costly mistakes.
t'ls about to happen to others as this issue of the magazine
Loci to press. In fact reports, from one large section of the
:ounlry, just received, indicate a turnover of over 18 per cent.

rowel Service of the National Recreation Association.

3.1mm: 1953

Why do the best business and industrial firms pay good
salaries and then—to make doubly sure they will not lose
workers—supplement basic income with bonus, pension,
deferred payment and stock plans? The primary reason is
dollars and cents—the costs of recruiting, training and se-
lecting new workers in addition to loss in production. The
wise concerns do not intend to lose the investment in train-
ing and experience giVen to workers and let competitors
reap the benefit.

If there is any truth in this observation, isn’t it all the more
significant fo'r recreation—where leaders are working with
pe0ple instead of things? What about the loss and waste in
human values? What profit it a community if it gains a low
salary scale and loses its self-respect?

Are not the children on the playgrounds, in the parks and
community centers the same as those in the schools? Is not
their safety—physically, morally and spiritually—and their
general welfare just as important out of school as in school?
The greatest hazard to the recreation movement, the greatest
obstacle in the way of attractive parks, playgrounds and liv-
able communities is bad leadership. It kills (recreation at
the roots and drains away its Spirit.

Recreation is big business with large investments in prop-
erties, buildings and facilities. Only good management and
qualified leadership will assure a fair return. The stakes
are large economically and socially.

Recreation is a recognized profession, standing on its own
feet and maintaining its individual identity. It has a well
defined philosophy, personnel standards and professional
training centers granting graduate and undergraduate de-
grees in recreation. Specialization has taken place at the
graduate level in such areas as community recreation, hos-
pital, rural and industrial recreation. There is something
wrong with community pride and civic leadership when
truck drivers, plumbers and unskilled and non-professional
workmen are paid more than qualified recreation leaders.
Recreation leaders must invest in college training and pro-
fessional preparation. They must have good character, lead-
ership ability and a variety of functional and activity skills.

275

They must maintain a respectable living standard and pro-
vide for continuous cultural and professional deve10pmcnt.
There is something wrong with an economy where high
standards of education and the best in human qualities are
demanded and substandard salaries prevail.

Who should be interested in fair salaries for recreation
workers? The answer is—everybody. Public officials, serv-
ice and civic clubs, chambers of commerce, churches,
Junior Leagues, PTA’s, mothers clubs and all community
Spirited groups should work for fair salaries for these
essential leaders who give so much for so little.

Board members, what can you do to help improve the
situation? If you are about to hire a recreation superin-
tendent or if you have one already on the job you should
analyze his position, if this has not already been done.
What is it he does that makes him important to your com-
munity? What are his duties, functions and responsibili-
ties? What worker requirements, and personal and pro-
fessional qualifications are necessary for one in such a
position to function satisfactorily? Write it all up so that
you will understand and have no doubt about the signifi-
cance of this position. Then you will be able to interpret
its importance and value to those who can help bring about
fair salaries—your public officials and the general public.
The cities that have the best salary schedules appear to be
the ones that have prepared good job descriptions, in
writing. There must be a relationship.

Do the same thing for the other jobs. If you do not have
a civil service commission or city personnel director who
has already defined them, have your superintendent do it.
If you need help ask the assistance of the National Rec-
reation Association’s field representative the next time he
comes to town. Use the association’s booklet, Personnel
Standards in Recreation, Leadership”, as a guide. It is
important for you to know what these positions are. Also,
it is important that the people hired to fill them know what
is expected of them today, next week and next month. The
job description is a basic instrument for recruiting and
selecting qualified workers and for evaluating job per-
formance.

If you want to compare salaries, do it with professional
positions in related fields where factors such as character,
personality, education, experience and functional ability
are somewhat similar. These will include fields such as
those of education and social welfare.

It would be better to add full-time year-round staff grad-
ually and have better leaders at higher salaries than to
expand with unqualified workers, just because they are
available at sub-standard salaries.

Most pe0ple will agree that salaries are too low and that
they should be high enough to recognize the important civic
responsibilities carried by recreation leaders. One does not
enter the recreation profession to get rich. However, serv-
ice-minded and well qualified recreation leaders should not
be expected to take a vow of poverty in order to carry on
an essential service in a high-tension and highly indus-
trialized society. Salary should be more than enough to pay

the rent and keep the milkman happy. It should be ade
quate to allow for sharing in the cultural and spiritual lil
of the community, and should permit one to keep abrea'
of his profession.

If you are a medium-sized city paying a well qualifie
superintendent of recreation a salary of six thousand do
lars it may not be enough and is probably not as good a
you think. In terms of 1939 purchasing power it is wort
about thirty-two hundred dollars.

If you are paying an assistant executive, supervisor (
center director, five thousand dollars he is no better 0
than when he was receiving twenty-six hundred dolla
back in 1939, even though he has accumulated some val‘
able experience and additional education.

One city in the Great Lakes Region has reported the fa
lowing salary scale for 1953: recreation instructors, $3,321
$6,027; directors of neighborhood centers, $5,027—37,12'
recreation supervisors, $5,127-$7,577; division director
$5,527--$7,977. The executive director receives a great de
more. Community center directors and leaders in 01
eastern city can go to $10,000, and several have reached th
maximum.

 

How should a city pay its recreation leaders, that '.
those who are well qualified for their assignments? Th
all depends upon how much your city cares about its re
reation service. It depends upon what kind of standard
wants for its citizens. Whatever your city wishes to p:
within reason, it can afford to pay. It cannot afford che:
and unqualified leaders—it should not afford less thz
the best.

Minimum salaries for professional recreation leade
should be high enough to attract young men and women
promise. The maximum should be high enough to hold tl
experienced and the competent.

Board members and t0p management officials have
heavy responsibility for the welfare and fair treatment
the workers under their jurisdiction. The failure or succe
of these people means failure or success of the progra
which the administration has pledged to provide.

Matters of promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off a1
salary adjustment are important events in the lives
employees. If they are handled justly they will become w:
adjusted and competent leaders. Careless handling m:
destroy morale, efficiency and injure the service as well
the professional worker’s future. Salaries should be I
viewed and adjusted periodically; in this way workers w
know that their efforts are being evaluated and proper
rewarded.

Recap:er

It secms unbelievable that in a large number of cities
Le recreation positions have never been analyzed or de-
ned, but it is true, although such procedure is the first
ep toward the development of a sound salary schedule.
As a general guide the following suggested salaries are
sled. Thcse, in the opinion of a special committee which

has given careful thought and study to the matter, are both
reasonable and obtainable. Some of these ranges have been
exceeded.

These salaries assume that workers filling such positions
have professional education and preparation, adequate ex-
perience, and are well qualified and competent. For further
details on personnel standards for these and other positions
consult Personnel Standards in Recreation Leadership.
This forty-five page report lists duties, responsibilities and
requirements for most positions found in community rec-
reation departments. It also contains suggestions for main-
taining personnel standards. City oflicials and especially
members of recreation boards should study this report.

There is no economy in low standards. Good salaries,
competent and enthusiastic leaders, will justify your rec-
reation budget and will assure more and a better quality of
recreation service in an ever-increasing percentage of your
total population. Cities have been known to lose their
recreation budgets because of poor leadership. So, for your
budget’s sake and every other good reason, watch those
salaries, keep an eye on the competent ones and save them
for your community.

Reoreatiun Board Issue

PROGRESS in recreation in the nation’s capital is recorded
in a report issued by the recreation board of the District
of Columbia at the conclusion of ten years of service. The
board, created in 1942, is composed of seven members,
four of them citizens-at-large and three representing gov-
ernmental agencies. The citizen members are appointed by
the district commissioners for a four-year term, and from
these the board officers are elected. The district commis-
sion and ‘the board of education each appoints its own
representative for a one-year term and the Office of Na-
tional Capital Parks is represented by its superintendent as
an ex-ochio member.

Important steps taken by the board following its appoint-
ment included the drafting of rules and regulations to guide
the board’s procedures and to inform the recreation staff
of their duties, responsibilities and privileges. These rules
have now been codified and printed. Other tasks were:
the analysis and classification of recreation department jobs
and a job survey of all such positions; the clarification of
the board’s authority and its relation to other governmental
agencies involved in the planning, conduct and supervision
of the city’s recreation program. Agreements were reached:
with the OHice of National Capital Parks, designating this
agency to perform the work of planning, development and
maintenance; with the board of education, renewed season-
ally, for the use of school buildings and grounds with
recognition that the recreation board has authority to de-
termine policies in regard to such uses; with the commis-
sioners and the board of education on the planning of new
school buildings to include community recreation facilities
which will be available to the recreation board; and with
the National Capital Housing Authority for the use of
community facilities under its jurisdiction. Various pro-
posals for the reorganization of the district government,
which would have wiped out the autonomy of the recrea-
tion board, were firmly and successfully opposed.

The growth in the service rendered by the department is
.revealed by the total attendance figures which increased
from 6,708,331 in 1943 to 13,553,984 in 1952. The num-
ber of recreation units operated increased from 124 to 144
during this period. Significant program developments were
the extension of services to children of pre-school age, the

278

District of Columbia

development of day camp programs, and new services in-
cluding the Golden Age Hobby Show for older age groups.
Marked advance in cultural activities is noted, with the de-
velopment of the Washington Civic Orchestra and numerous
choral groups, in creative dance and in new phases of arts
and crafts. Other projects developed during the decade
include the fishing rodeo, golf instruction, the Walter John-
son Baseball Leagues, the Children’s Theater of Washingtori
and sponsorship of the Federal Golf Association.

Strengthening and expansion of the department’s stafi
was achieved through the upgrading of recreation positions
and the increase from 105 full-time and 166 part-time
leadership positions in 1942 to 208 full-time and 250 part-
time positions in 1952.

The recreation board has established the following policy
in regard to segregation: “The board will make every pos
sible and realistic effort toward the removal of racia
segregation in public recreation in such sequence and a
such rate of progression as may be consistent with tilt
public interest, public order and effective administration
The board, by majority vote of the whole board at a state(
meeting, shall from time to time issue necessary orders t(
the superintendent to implement this policy.” It is signifi
cant that nineteen neighborhood-center units and eight daj
camps are now operated on an “open” basis.

The emphasis in 1942 upon city-wide sports organiza
tions culminating in a city-wide playoff, has been replace:
by a regional organization plan designed to develop :
strong neighborhood sports program. The city is divide:
into ten regions, each .with a supervising director. Thi
decentralized plan allows greater community participatior
and facilitates cooperation with community and neighbor
hood organizations.

The range of activities provided at the neighborhoo:
centers is indicated by the following events scheduled fo

1951-52:

July —Independence Day celebrations, horse-shoes, softbal‘
swimming meets.

The appropriation for operating expenses of the depart-
ment increased from $379,788 for 1943 to $1,558,000 for
1952. Appropriations for capital outlay increased from
$26,500 to $200,000 in the same period. Receipts from en-
tertainments, dances, dues, fees and other special uses
totaled $70,000 in 1952 and were handled in a Special trust
fund.

Other sections of the report describe in detail the plan
for achieving cooperation in the planning, development and
maintenance of recreation units in the district, accomplished
through the Coordinating Committee on Recreation Plans;
the creation of a public relations section, which has helped
in the preparation of publications and other publicity
materials—in receiving out-of-town and foreign visitors
and in studying public recreation programs and needs; and
the significant part which the department has played in
rendering service to the armed forces and in the civil de-
fense program. The report ends with “A Look to the
Future,” in which uncompleted tasks which are now chal-
lenging the department are reviewed. The creation of the
board is vindicated in the concluding sentence: “By the
present organizational structure and the over-all responsi-
bility exercised by the board, this body is provided with the
most effective and eflicient method possible to do its job

aggressively.”

RECREA’I‘IllN SURVEYS

OF SMALL
COMMUNITIES

ROBABLY the most common type of
P recreation survey of small commu-
nities is the exploratory survey. Its
purpose is to find out what needs, if
any, exist, what the people want, and
what can be done about it.

Most small communities have made
at least a sporadic attempt to provide a
community recreation program. It may
have been a limited playground pro-
gram in the summer, a teen center,
baseball and softball playing, or some
special community events. These usu-
ally have been sponsored independent-
ly by civic groups, the schools or the
city. The history of failures is often
discouraging; and lack of continuity,
growth and permanence all too fre-
quently characterizes these efforts. This
often breeds a psych010gy of defeat that
is difficult to overcome. It sometimes
builds 11p a pattern of vested interests
which makes cooperation and coordi-
nation difficult. There exists the reali-
zation that community recreation is an
entity, 3 series of related services per-
formed by different

agencies and

groups, to be sure, but nevertheless, in
the areas of community life such as ed-
ucation, health, and the industrial or
economic and religious areas, it is
sometimes slow in dawning.

One of the purposes of a survey is
to establish this concept. Only when
this has been done is it possible to plan
effectively for the total community.

One major purpose of the survey is
educational. It is a means of getting
people to look at their local recreation
situation in an intelligent and system-
atic way, to consider the elements which
constitute it and the proper relationship
of facilities, finance, leadership, admin-
istration as well as the program and
services. It should, for example, lead to
the realization that a sound program
cannot be expected to result from a sec-
ond-rate kind of organization or none at
all. It may indicate that many existing
resources are going to waste.

The recreation survey should lead to
a program of action, for its value is in
relation to planning. Therefore it is
inherently promotional, since there have
to be general agreement and willing-
ness on the part of certain key agencies
and individuals to Spend money, coop-
erate, and assume responsibility before
any realistic plans can be carried out.

Consequently, what is done prior t<
making the survey, and who is involve(
in it, are at least as important as til!
survey itself. The outcome of the ex
ploratory survey depends very largte
upon the preparation for it. Who want
it? What problems have led to its con
sideration? What will be done with it!

Probably the easiest way to make-
survey is to call in an expert and as]
him to do the job without botherin,
anybody in town any more than is al:
solutely necessary. Surveys made 
this manner are gathering dust in bot
tom drawers of many a mayor’s office
some of them are excellent surveys t0(

I do not wish to convey the impres
sion that I am opposed to the use of ou1
side specialists; it would be rather ir
consistent of me to do that. I heliev
rather, that they have an importar
function, but it is not that of doing 1
the work and making the recommend:
tions. This is especially fatal in th
small community. Since small commt
nities are so numerous and outside e}
perts are so few, there is a naturz
temptation for them to rush throug
things, to dump the whole load, as '

vey is not a dodge or a stall, but is

basis for doing the entire job.

An important part of the preliminary
ork is the organization of the survey
pnmittee and planning the steps. The
rinciple here is inclusiveness, wide
'presentation. Too often these jobs

[oup which belongs to the luncheon

IIany times people have told me with
ride that they had a hand in initiat-
1g their community recreation pro-
ran]. They interviewed their neigh-
ers, or collected data about possible
hurch facilities, or attended meetings

laving shared in the work and con-
'ibuted their ideas, they have a deep
unrest in what is done. The goal
hould be to enlist the help of people
rom all walks of life, minority groups,
hildren, and young people. Certainly
1e potential help of the young people
hould not be overlooked.

The small community recreation sur-

hould not be abstruse. It should in-
lude the listing and description of all
ohible facilities, public and private,
chools, church clubs, organizations for
ons and girls, hobby clubs, athletic
roups and social clubs. There should

they want to do. Sample forms for
these reports can be secured from state
recreation agencies, colleges offering
recreation training, or the National
Recreation Association. They should
be adapted to local circumstances. In-
formation of this nature can be secured
and recorded by volunteers.

Of course, it is necessary to assem-
ble pertinent data in regard to existing
organization for recreation. What com-
munity recreation programs are cur-
rently being provided by the municipal
government, the park department, the
schools and non-governmental groups?
How much is being spent, who is being
served, what is their scope?

What might be called the governmen-
tal pattern is also essential. This will
include the municipal government, the
school district, and the county govern-
ment. The tax valuation of these units,
their budgets, their bonding capacity,
and their legislative authority to use
tax funds for community recreation,
should be tabulated. ,

The extent to which social and eco-
nomic conditions, housing conditions,
transportation factors, climatic and
physiographic factors need to be stud-
died will depend somewhat upon the
size of the town and the ability of the
survey group to interpret them in terms
of a recreation plan. It is here that the
outside specialist can be of help. Cer-
tainly these things have a bearing on
the planning, should be discussed and
kept in mind, but it may not be neces-
sary to make them subjects for special
study in the exploratory survey.

The small community survey should
take into account the surrounding
country which the town serves. This
means bringing representatives in on
the planning and including them in the
survey. In fact, it involves formulating
the entire plan in terms of the town-
country community. '

The time required for the survey
should not he more than two or three
months. There are exceptions to this,

of course. For example, the town of
Greeley, Colorado, spent over a year
working on its recreation survey. The
mayor appointed a fact-finding com-
mittee headed by a faculty member of
Colorado State Teachers College, which
is located in Greeley. This committee
drew in practically every local organi-
zation, the city, the schools and the
college. .They made an exhaustive
study, sounded out opinion thorOUghly,
and eventually came up with a plan for
a community activities commission and
a broad program. The city, the schools,
and the college, were to be joint spon-
sors, all sharing the financial respon-
sibility. A course in Community Ac-
tivities at the college is required of all
sophomore students. A part of the
course requirement is a certain amount
of work, each week, in the community
program. The students are supervised
by the director of community activities.
There are a number of unique features
about this program which time does not
permit me to describe. The point here
is that sufficient time was spent, and the
characteristics and interests of the
community were so carefully consid-
ered that a plan, tailor-made to Greeley,
was the result.

The survey should not be allowed to
drag. As the work is being done, the
information should be reported and
discussed. In this way it is often pos-
sible to come to agreement on many
recommendations before the final re-
port is made. This, of course, virtually
insures action.

A prerequisite to success is a strong
action or ways and means committee.
This group does not necessarily have
to be formed at the conclusion of the
survey but may bc working all along to
unsnarl legal complications, pave the
way for cooperation of governmental
bodies, and in other ways help put the
plan on wheels.

Much of what I have said applies to
the town in which a recreation system
is to be instituted. There are many

281

other types of recreation surveys. An-
other type applies to a recreation de-
partment that is already in operation.
Its purpose is to improve. It may deal
with administration, finance, leader-
ship, facilities, program, relationships
with other agencies and organizations,
or any of a number of aspects of the
system. Such surveys need to be made
from time to time by every department,
large or small.

I have purposely stressed certain as-
pects of recreation surveys and have
slighted or ignored others. The reason
I emphasize the preliminary work, the
timing and getting everybody in on the
act, is that the importance of these
things has often been overlooked. In a
small town a high degree of cooperation

of joint effort in the planning. Fur-
thermore, it is important to keep'things
simple and realistic, for any elaborate
plan is apt to scare small town people
or become a target for ridicule.

Excellent guides for conducting rec-
reation surveys are available. They
should be studied, but care should be
exercised in using them because local
situations vary so much and many of
them are more applicable to larger
cities.

As a matter of fact, I have an abiding
faith in the democratic process. I be-
lieve that if a really representative
group is brought together, and such
basic facts as I have indicated are as-
sembled and discussed, these facts will
be interpreted and a sound plan will re-
sult. Of course it is wise to look at what

the standards that have been developed.
The main thing, however, is to givs
people a chance to express themselves.
and to provide the atmosPhere for com-
munity c00peration. The recreatior
survey can help to accomplish this if ii

is planned that way.

Accident Insurance

Arrangements have been made with the United Pacific In-
surance Company of Tacoma, Washington, to provide all
participants in junior athletic activities, sponsored by the
Metropolitan Park Board of that city, with a plan of acci-
dent insurance which will assist in defraying the cost of
medical, surgical and hospital care resulting from accidents
occurring during play or practice of the same. All junior
participants are'required to subscribe to this plan before
they are allowed to participate.

OUTLINE OF PLAN

Accidental Death or Dismemberment Benehts——Five hun-
dred dollars payable for accidental death, and specific
amounts are payable for loss of members. These benefits are
payable in addition to other policy benefits where losses are
due to accidental injury and result within ninety days of the
date of accident.

Ambulance, Hospital, Nurses, Medical and Surgical Ex-
pense—Up to five hundred dollars for treatment of an acci-
dental bodily injury requiring medical or surgical treat-
ment, hospital confinement, ambulance service or the em-
ployment of a graduate nurse. Payment will be made in ac-
cordance with the medical fee schedulc attached to the policy
held by the Metropolitan Park Board. (The schedule will be
available for inspection by anyone covered under the pro-
gram on request.) The insured shall be liable for the first
five dollars of expense incurred for any one of the above
services for any one injury.

The Cost—-—0ne dollar for the season, of the covered sport,
for each junior participant.

dollar loan has been made possible. One of the housing
sites of five acres, when cleared of its present sub-standard
structures, is to be developed by the city as the first por-
tion of a new public park. Twenty-six of the forty-three
acres at another site are to be used for dwellings, with the
remainder turned over to the city for development as a
park.

Onc section of the report is devoted to a consideration of
the housing needs of the aged. It is pointed out that “where
the projects are sufficiently large, there will be special rec-
reational and visiting rooms for the elderly, in addition to
the community facilities provided in state-aided projects
for tenants and residents of the neighborhood . . . Our plan
of having their apartments in the same building with other
tenants, but protected in a separate wing, will give older
people both the advantages of community living and the
possibility of withdrawing to a sheltered haven all their own
whenever they wish.”

A section deals with mutually-owned housing develop-
ments which are built under provisions of the state’s limited
dividend housing law. In referring to one cooperative vet-
erans” development, it states:

When' one becomes aware of the high proportion of children in
this develOpment, it is clear why the one community project
dearest to the parents is tbe playground and summer play pr0gram.
There are eleven large playgrounds within the forty acres of Bell
Park Gardens. During the summer months, seven of these play-
grounds are devoted to a parent—organized play program that at-
tracts ever-increasing interest in the neighborhood. To the standard
'equipment originally provided were added many new pieces, in—
cluding outdoor showers, and tables and benches, much of which
was built by the mothers and fathers working evenings and week-
ends. Professionally trained c0unselOrs and a director are retained
to supervise the many activities, such as dances, songfests, games,
crafts, picnics and trips to places of interest away from the project.
Approximately five hundred children are expected to enroll in the
playground program during the summer. Guiding the Operations
are committees of participants who devote many hours throughout
the year, planning the program and eXploring ways to improve and
add to it.

The extent to which community recreation opportunities
are provided in public housing projects in New York City
is indicated. Programs, a number of which are carried on
in cooperation with public and private agencies, are co-
ordinated by the Community Activities Division of the
local Housing Authority. The extensive network of well-
equipped community facilities, each of which is staffed with
skilled professional workers, includes: thirty-two children’s
centers (nursery schools for preschool children from three
to five); thirty-six community centers (recreation centers
for school-age children, adolescents and adults); fourteen
play school programs (for children of working mothers) ;
twelve branch libraries.

New facilities opened in the twelve-month period ending
March 31, 1952 included four children’s centers, nine rec-
reation centers, three branch libraries.

RECREATHIN ta 7a: 5m

WORKERS in our- field are prone to ne-
glect the more intellectual and cul-
tural aspects that should go with the
employment of leisure time. If recrea-
tion is to be educational, the potentiali-
ties of the shorter work-week, from
the standpoint of the recreation worker,
ought to be more than crafts and soft-
ball; and it often is true that these as-
pects are more easily attainable in the
recreation department of a small com-
munity. Here it is really easier to have
a comprehensive recreation program,
to have it reach a much bigger percent-
age of the population, and to have it be-
come an integral part of the social life
of the town, than it is to devise some-
thing of the same nature for the big
city. The town of five hundred to a
thousand can do things in recreation
under active leadership that Omaha or
Denver or Chicago will never be able to
do. This is not meant to discourage or
disparage the work in any larger com-
munity, but to encourage the leaders of
the smaller communities to do for their
communities what the leaders in the big
communities will never be able to do.
It is much easier to do a good job in a
small town.

284

 

larger communities are found under the
apprOpriate headings.

It will be seen by looking at these
data that the facilities taken rather for
granted in the small town would be
looked upon as practically impossible

of attainment in a town of 20,000; and
in a town of 265,000 these would be

looked upon as utterly fantastic! Th
small place has more facilities per un
of population. In the large city that
tend to be huge concentrations of facil
ties much farther apart, more diHicu
to reach, and usually not well blesse
with parking facilities. In the sma
community, the high school is apt t
be the social center of the communit
and, since it is an institution finance
by public taxes, recreation should I:
considered as much a public function, I
be conducted within and around thz
building, as are other forms of educ:
tion.

In the small community, a larger pei
centage of the homes have ample yard
and there usually are many more 0pc
spaces or “vacant lots.” The large con
munity has one advantage only—Hit
apt to have some facilities which th
very small communities cannot aflort

Some General Observations

1. Many recreation facilities are out (
doors and, during a large part of [ll
winter, are not usable. At such time
the availability of the school plant ma
be an important item.

2. There is great need for more empln
sis upon. a recreation-education pn
grain in the schools. Too frequcntl
there is no attempt to indoctrinate th
school p0pulation, which in a few yea]
will become the tax paying voters, wit
the idea that recreation facilities an
habits are important.

3. Because of bad weather during pal
of the year, making transportation dill
cult, recreation-minded people shoul
prepare our populace for recreation an
physical conditioning activities 2
home, in their own yards, basenler
playrooms, and so on. There needs t
be a great deal more of such decentral
zation of recreation. This does not i

the least imply that there should 1)

us that, in addition to these larger

reation, are apt to think of what it will
cost in terms of upkeep; they tend to
be tax-minded. The women are likely
to think of the benefits to their children
and to themselves, and are apt to be
more child-minded. if the women of
the community are sold on an idea, the
men usually follow along.

3. The organizing committee needs to
keep in mind recreation for all ages,
both sexes, and rural as well as towns-
people.

4. if at all possible there should ‘be a
paid executive. One man or woman
can often serve several small communi-
ties. In addition to the executive, the
lay committee and other “unattached”
laymen are extremely important.

5. Newspaper support should be sought
from the beginning. in one small com-
munity, during the organization of the
recreation department, it was arranged
with the editor of the weekly paper that
pictures be taken of facilities that were
being installed in individual back yards.
as well as of the more centralized recre-
ational facilities. Stories each week, to
go with the pictures, resulted eventually
in a great increase in the decentralized
recreation facilities. The recreation ex-
ecutive should learn to write up news
stories, have a sort of newspaper mind-
edness, and not just ask that it all be
done for him by the editor.

Kinds of Activities for \Vhich to
Plan

it should be remembered that there
is a need for different kinds of activities
for different interests and different skill
levels. 1 divide them roughly as follows:

1. Individual activities, often discussed
or shared with other like-minded people,
such as music, manual arts, crafts, fish-
ing, hunting, painting, photography,
and other creative and sports activities.
2. Dual activities, such as checkers,
chess, and other quiet games, golf or
tennis, and so on.

3. Team activities, such as athletics,
games, relays.

4. Group activities (as distinguished
from team activities) such as dramat-
ics, group discussions, orchestras, sing-
ing, bird or nature study, other club ac-
tivities, special group projects.

5. Intellectual activities, such as drama,
play-reading, story-writing, debating.
6. Social activities, such as entertain-
ments and “spectator” sports activities,
parties, games, folk and square danc-
ing, and so on.

All of these types of recreation rep-
resent many, many different forms of
activities, references to which are read-
ily available in recreation literature. it
behooves the recreation director not to
overlook any category, even though he
may not have something organized in
each one at the moment.

Some General Principles

1. The organizer of recreational activ-
ities, in the small community particu-
larly, should first seek out those who
are naturally enthusiastic, train them
(or have them trained by someone else)
and then turn them loose—but keep on
stimulating them continually so that
they do not lose their enthusiasm. To
illustrate: at the University of Iowa
our tennis coach, Dr. Klotz, has been

285

most active in teaching people in vari-
ous communities how to teach tennis
most effectively. These enthusiasts in a
local community—if someone keeps
their enthusiasm up—soon have tennis
being played by both young and old.
Another illustration is the stimulation
of home-talent dramatics, often through
the organization of a drama league
within the recreation organization it-
self. A third is the organization of craft
guilds, perhaps started by one enthusi-
ast, and later carried on by others who
are trained. These guilds frequently
Split off to form major organizations of
their own. It would seem to me that
one of the objectives of the recreation
executive should be to attempt to build
semi-independent groups which will
carry on without further stimulus.

2. If a split-off group—such as a school

athletic league, school-sponsored edu-.

cational motion pictures, a rural YMCA
ahead, the

should encourage and aid it.

league—goes executive

3. In addition to the board of direc-
tors in a small town, or a committee
representing the recreation movement,
a group of activity leaders should be
organized. These are the enthusiastic
persons who keep activities going
while the committee or board raises
money and develops support.

4. The recreation executive and the
committee should not try to do too much
at one time. It is possible to have so
many things going in a small commu-
nity that there are hardly enough people
left to take part in each of them. The
executive and the committee need to
assess priorities and try not to impose
a big-city program locally.

5. The leaders of the recreation pro-
gram should never be content with what
they have deve10ped; it is important
that they keep after the program to im-
prove it, to keep enthusiasm at the
point where it is constantly getting
things done—for unless one winds a

clock from day to day, it is apt to run

down. On the other hand, sometime
the community outgrows one type I
activity, and this activity needs to b
replaced by another.

I am h0ping that those of us wh
come from small communities will mak
a resolution to study the possibilitie
in that small community, to talk thing
over with potential local leaders, and t
develop a program that will provide l<
cal residents with an interest in thos
types of cultural activities which ca
be practiced during the hours magi]
free by the shorter work-week, in sui
ways as to improve the cultural level (

Part of the summary of a 1952 questionnaire sent
to wives of members of the Yale class of 1937.

Mr. and Mrs. Yale like to do things

together; and they like many of the
same things, with a healthy division of
tastes as well. She permits his men’s
golf with good grace, but occasionally
deplores his fondness for jazz. She is
an active creature and probably owes
her nice figure to the sports she follows.
Only two women professed abhorrence
of all forms of exercise. The list of
her favorite outdoor recreations runs
as follows: gardening (192), swim:
ming (100), tennis (75), golf (69),
sailing (46), skating (41), skiing
(36), fishing (34), riding (27), and
shooting (19). With the exception of
gardening she does these things with
her husband, although, there are‘a few

996

husbands with green thumbs, and some
of the husbands play men’s golf of a
Saturday afternoon. Her favorite in-
door amusements—besides reading—
are radio (179), bridge (165), needle-
work (139), television (132), canasta
(124), crossword puzzles (83), poker
(52) , gin rummy (31) . Skills or crafts
are represented as follows: music (81) ,
painting (67), collecting (58), pot-
tery (12), weaving (7), and flower
arranging  Besides these recrea-
tions, she and her husband do some
traveling, do a little theatre-going, and
see an occasional movie.

Weekends are spent together for the
most part, with sports or family proj-
ects in the day time and a party on

Saturday night. “We have friends i
for dinner,” or “We go out wil
friends” were the most frequei
phrases. On Sunday, although 71 p:
cent of the women are church member

'less than half go to church regularl

However, 70 per cent of them send tl
children to Sunday school. Sunday
a family day with visits to in-laws
they’re within reach and a quiet ev
ning at home.

There is not much evidence of tl
familiar pattern in which the wife at
children go to another place for tl
summer where the husband comes ft
the weekends. Thirty of the familil
follow this scheme. but 154 do nc
many of the latter expressing ket
dislike of,it. No, they stick togeth:
and in the great majority of cases tl
family goes on vacation together.

IS SOME “GIVE” on STRETI'

.5- 'I-P

The answer to this question is easily found in simple faCts with which any experi-

enced craftstrip worker or teacher is familiar. We have designed Rexlace to have a

high degree of pliability and a carefully determined and carefully controlled amount

of “give” or stretch for these reasons:

I.

In braiding, wrapping, and lacing, the craftstrip has to bend and turn to shape itselfl
the work. Craftsu'ip, like a ribbon, is flat in shape. Without pliability and give, it resis
taking the desired shapes.

Do we want a rigid ribbon with no give or stretch, like a clock spring (which has al
solutely none) or do we require some degree of pliability and give such as we have i

leather —— and also in Rexlace?

The above explains why a rigid craftstrip with no give or Stretch has to be pulled so harn
in making a lanyard. The give and pliability of Rexlace let it shape itself to the wor]
easily and naturally, without excessive forcing. With Rexlace the hard pulling and th
great care to prevent slipping back are eliminated — also the extreme tiring of the finger:

When a flat blank is wrapped for a bracelet or kerchief slide and then bent to shape, th
lace on the outside is put under great tension. Unless it has some give to it, it is apt tI
break, either when bent or later. Breaking of even a single strand ruins the project just a

it is finished. In this case, a reasonable amount of stretch is a necessity, and a rigid lac

is an unwise 'choice.

Spaces left between turns in wrapping with Rexlace are easily closed by pushing the turns

‘*—*‘

together, and due to its give or stretch, the lace remains tight —-— a great advantage, es-
pecially for children.

Rigid laces loosen up when turns are pushed together, making it necessary to position
them perfectly on the first try. They are also hard to push together.

With a little give, one or two wrapping strands can be lifted and the unsightly lace ends

slipped under for complete concealment. This cannot be done with a rigid lace.

z pulling hard enough — far harder than is ever necessary in making any article ---
axlace can be stretched out of shape, just as rigid laces, by excessive pulling, can

: snapped and broken. Neither point has any importance.

M for fine craftlace work and for easy working, the give or Stretch in Rexlace is
St as necessary, just as apparent, and juSt as Common sense as non-flammability.
hese qualities together with a durable, washable finish and fine colors make Rexlace

1 outstanding produCt for holding old customers and selling new ones.

 Do not confuse solid plastic Rexlace with leathercraft laces made from
solid plastic. Leathercraft requires a lace with much more stretch and softness to shape
itself to leather. Such lace has far too much stretch for craftstrip work.

Leathercraft lace also requires an oval cross-section to give a line edge instead.of the
rectangular section needed in craftstrip. Although containing much less material and
selling for less, leathercraft lace is absolutely unsatisfactory for craftstrip work and rums
most craftstrip projects in which it is used.

F 1111 -Time Leisure

in Off-Work Hours

A New York investment business takes a long look ahead
in its current, special anniversary issue of INVESTOR’S
READER——a news publication about business and finance——
and has the following to say about recreation:

o THERE Is No PRECEDENT for the Solid Sixties. If present
trends continue, Americans will have more money to spend
and more time to Spend it. Continued deflation may cut total
dollar wages but real wages will rise. Barely a few weeks
ago the thoughtful Twentieth Century Fund predicted a 30
per cent increase in real wages in the next decade.

Even in the prosperity of today, the combination of soft
hours and hard cash is one of the least understood phenome-
non of the times. For one thing, the impact of more leisure
and cash was not felt until the war-fraught Forties. In those
days, many businessmen and psychologists figured the free-
spending of fun-seeking Americans was a temporary “es-
cape” mechanism with nouveau riche overtones.

Nowadays the demand for diversion is accepted as a
supercharged force. One indication is the added employee
inducements of private industry. Company-sponsored bowl-
ing, softball and basketball teams are commonplace; more
and more outfits employ full-time recreation directors. A
few like Phillips Petroleum in out-of-the-way Bartlesville,
Oklahoma, provide swimming pools, bowling alleys, club
rooms and skating rinks for after-hours fun. Meantime city
fathers vote bond issues to finance “tot-lots” for the sand-
pile set, shufiieboard courts for the aged, public golf courses
and toboggan slides for the in-betweens.

This means more markets for a long list of manufacturers
which supply everything from aSphalt (for playground sur-
faces) to jungle-gyms to volley-balls.

Equally important is that most Americans spend money
freely in their free time. In the past four years, US citizens
have dished out over five per cent of their total personal
expenditures for recreation (not counting dinners in town,
on the road, or trips). In 1952 this added to $11.7 billion
another $2 billion or so for business and pleasure jaunts.

Millions go into Sports clothes, luggage, badminton
“birds’” and golf clubs; still more is spent for expansion-
attic worksh0ps, garden tools, boat kits, cameras and dark-
room supplies, stamp and coin collections, model railrdads,
toy airplanes and other hobbies. "In Chicago last fortnight,
happy members of the National Association of Music Mer-
chants heard that record sales will top $200,000,000 this
year. Not long ago the “platter boys” were considered dead.
Pianos are likewise “hot” items.

Pierce, Fenner & Bean. °

The lure of leisure spreads further. To save time for
gardens, games or gossip, housewives want automatic dish-
washers, clothes dryers and quick-to-cook frozen foods.
Clothing is more casual and informal-living habits mirror the
importance Americans place upon spare-time sports and
recreation.

And for most industries dedicated to American amuse-
ment the next decade looks as sweet as a 250-yard drive
down the fairway. Only a few will be in the rough.

Two big factors are TV and the trend towards do-it-your-
self. Every businessman knows the impact of television on
the nation’s entertainment habits: (1) fewer pe0ple eat out
for fun; (2) more and more stay away from ball parks,
stadiums, theaters and night clubs. Equally important but
less recognized is the do-it-yourself trend in almost every
activity from boating to building.

The past few years are a good example. Gains in p0pula-
tion and income to the contrary, admissions to. spectator
amusements fell from $1.8 billion in 1949 to $1.5 billion
last "year. The only exception: race tracks. Meantime the
amount spent for television and radio receivers, phono-
graphs, parts and records rose from $1.9 billion four years
ago to $2.3 billion last year; informal recreation of all types
has risen who-knows-what . . . .

More intangible is the sociological influence of television.
Unlike most modes of entertainment, it makes the home a

. recreation center . . . .

With long-term mortgages on their ranch-type love-nests,
most newly-weds of 1963 will prefer first-row seats in front
I of TV. Bookshelves will be filled with how-to-do-it pocket-
books. Games like Mah Jong, triple-deck Bolivia and Scrab-
ble will fade and fade. ln tune with current television stars,
amateur musicians and “talented kids” will while away at
ukes, guitars or small electronic organs.

For companies like US Playing Cards, Wurlitzer and G. C.
Conn (instrument), this is fine. At the same time, TV and
education create a taste for things like swimming, good
literature—and Paris.

More pe0ple than ever will get away from it all by flexing
muscle and mind at active sports and games. Golf is on the
upswing with 3,265,000 active pros and dufiers; so are
skiing, riding, shooting, sailing and even soccer. Last year,
US men and women shelled out $790,000,000 for Sports
goods, plus $170,000,000 for green fees, and so on.

Boat and pleasure aircraft purchases are way up and some
people expect a 15 per cent increase by 1963. Another
pointer is the larger amount spent to buy and train hunting
dogs; still another is a record 21,000,000 fishing and hunt-
ing licenses. .

This means more travel to find trout streams or sun or
snow. Beaches, resorts, hotels and cruises will get a healthy
share of the 1963 diversion dollar; so will railroads, air-
lines, buses and steamships.

Directly affected by all this are sporting-goods makers
like Jantzen, Chris-Craft, Remington Arms, Savage Arms,
Wilson Sporting Goods (subsidiary of meat packer Wilson) 1
and A. G. Spalding. In the long run almost every industry
will share in the happy trend created by more leisure time.

Hence 1963 should be fun for all.

RECREATION

ADMINISTRATION

RECREATION IN LOS ANGELES

'Playgrounds—The development of new playgrounds
under our 1947 bond program was greatly slowed down by
the regulations of the National Production Authority. Re-
cently these have been relaxed and we have resumed the
construction of seven playgrounds, and are letting contracts
for playground clubhouses about one per week. We shall
complete the total program by the end of this calendar year.
One of the interesting features in the wind-up of this
program is the arrangement for construction of a two-pool
swimming facility to be erected in Wilmington, on a park
pr0perty adjacent to the Harbor Junior College. This is a
new junior college, the curriculum of which is geared to
the employment needs of the harbor district. It was Opened
during the war and is now in full operation with about
three thousand students enrolled, and with a fine plant.
Our seventy-acre playground adjoining it has been de-
velopcd for community use but it will also be of consider-
able assistance to the college. We have entered into a
contract with the board of education whereby it will share
equally with us in the cost of construction and Operation of
the pools, one of which will be indoors. The total cost of
construction is estimated at $350,000.
lieacliesuAt our beaches we had unusual success last sum-
mer in concentrating the building of fires at a single loca-
tion where we have about one thousand fire rings. This
development is upon a portion of the five-mile beach which
was widened by the dredging of sand several years ago, so

~ y camps, important part of summer schedule, are espeeial-
designed for youngsters unable to go to regular eamp.

 

   

From a report of en rrent developments related to the
services of the Los Angeles Department of Recreation
and Parks, as of May 1953, by George H jelte, General
Manager.

at the point of the fire rings it is about one thousand feet
wide. Building of fires everywhere on the beach is an
untenable plan, owing to the dirtying of sand with coals
and ashes and possible burning of feet from live embers in
the sand. The designation of a single place for many fire
rings also has been a welcome thing to hundreds of young
people’s groups, who now find a convenient place with
parking facilities, fire rings, and supervision——-where a
beach party might be held on warm summer evenings, on
the shores of the Pacific. Many church and other youth-
serving groups are availing themselves of this fine public
recreation service.

While on the subject of beaches I might say that we look
forward to a considerable expansion of the beach as well
as the inland park program of the state. Thc state has
aided cities and counties in the purchase of ocean frontage
under a program requiring local matching of state appro-
priations. California now has vast expanse of sandy and
scenic shoreline in the public domain, but with the rapidly
growing population of this state, the future needs will be
for conveniences and facilities on the public beach, includ-
ing parking areas, sanitary conveniences, lifesaving installa-
tiOns, game facilities, and so on.

There is now a possibility that the federal government
will quit-claim the paramount right which it has heretofore
claimed to the tidelands of coastal states. ’This will release
oil-royalty funds derived from drilling in the tidelands,
which in California have been impounded for several years.
The sum total is now around fifty million dollars, of which
nearly thirty million dollars have been allocated to state
beach and park purposes by former action of the legislature.
After President Eisenhower has signed the impending legis-
lation, this fund, or a good portion of it, will undoubtedly
be available for further beach and park acquisition and
deve10pmcnt throughout this state.

Anticipating such an eventuality the state park com1nis-
sion has declared a policy favorable to the incorporation of
all beaches in the state into one great recreation and park
system. relieving the cities of the cost and obligation of

291

financing much needed beach improvements. This could be
an outstanding deveIOpment in the next few years toward
the use of our shoreline for recreation. Beaches, we believe,
are probably our greatest natural recreational resource, not
equaled by the mountains, valleys, forests, and other natural
resources of the coast range and Sierra mountains.

Park System—Golf has gone forward considerably. We
recently opened a splendid additional nine-hole golf course
in Griffith Park. We now have eleven units of nine holes
each at three separate locations. I believe this is a larger
number of municipal golf courses than in any other city in
America, although some metropolitan areas have greater
golf facilities which are provided through county and state
agencies. We also are building two eighteen-hole courses
in the San Fernando Valley, on flood control land which
we have leased from the federal government for fifty years.
One such lease of 2,000 acres is in the Sepulveda Basin, and
the other of 1,700 acres is in the Hansen Darn area, both in
the San Fernando Valley. As the vast freeway system
develOps in this metropolitan area, these regional parks will
be highly valued for year-round recreation by the people
of this area, the population of which is now estimated to be
four and a half million.

An interesting installation recently has been made, in
Griffith Park, known as Travel Town. It consists of an
educational display of travel equipment of yesteryear.
Transportation companies have taken a great interest in
this project and have donated or loaned exhibits of ex-
traordinary character. One of these is a great locomotive

which pulled the overnight train from San Francisco to
Los Angeles for many years, weighing 125 tons, not includ-
ing the tender. Other railroads have installed similar dis-
plays alongside those of the street railway system, the stage
coach lines, and so on. Not only do children enjoy seeing,
and climbing upon, these interesting vehicles, but the whole
exhibit has a nostalgic effect upon those of mature years.

Program

1. In the field of program on playgrounds we have done
some interesting things of late. Upon the Opening of the
fishing season in California, we opened four of our park
lakes to juvenile fishing, all under some supervision.
Throughout the entire summer these lakes, which are in
the center of urban parks, will be stocked with fish by the

292

Barbershop quartet in
action. A wide range of
activities for adults is
offered on playgrounds.

 

. . . . . . I
Cahfornla State Flsh and Game Comm1ss10n, and fishlng

will be enjoyed three days a week by those under twelve years
of age. For the adults we opened our 12-mile Crowley Lake
situated in the Owens River country 320 miles from our
city, and from which most of the Los Angeles water supply
comes. Here we have a fleet of boats which we rent. Over
one thousand public and private boats were on the lake
opening day.

2. Recently our baseball schools have been put into
operation on all playgrounds, with the aid of professional
baseball players who contribute their services. The Pacific
Coast Baseball League gives fine support to these and is
glad to send its best representatives to assist in the instruc-
tion. All this contributes to our so-called Little Coast
League baseball program in which hundreds of teams play
regularly throughout the season, and which is so organized
as to avoid the objectionable features of the Little League
baseball movement which has spread across the country.
We subscribe thoroughly to the principles set forth by the
American Association for Health, Physical Education and
Recreation, the American Recreation Society, and similar
agencies in respect to these matters, but we believe that
only by having a constructive and widespread program
that meets the need in a constructive way can we channel
the zeal and patronage of adults who otherwise are inclined
to accept such a program as “Little League Baseball.”

3. We should like to mention, too, the May Day festivals
which had been in preparation for weeks and which were
held at all of the municipal playgrounds. These festival:
motivate activities of many kinds in the preparatory pro-
cess, and the events bring together many aspects of our
total service. The consolidation of the recreation and park
departments of Los Angeles has heen beneficial in many
ways. Our playgrounds are now much better landscaped!
than before, and events such as spring festivals are en-
hanced in beauty and effectiveness by flowers and plants
readily made available to the recreation personnel by the
landscape division.

4. Our prOgram, of course, includes many Special events
and, while these are all very important, we regard them too
as the “spice” of what otherwise would be a program with
little zest and special attraction. We do believe, however.
that the day to day routine activities on playgrounds are

RECREATION

7

the most valuable contribution in a system such as ours.
In order to keep this program at a high pitch we have
rcccntly taken steps to see to it that these routine activitics
are madc more and more interesting.

' omen’s In-Service Vacation Fan for Teen-Agers—The
econd demonstration of the special in-scrvice training pro-
ccts was hcld May 12, at Shatto Drama Centcr. It was an
‘{position of vacation fun for teen-age youth. The material
esented indicated skillful and thorough research on the
rt of every committee member. The session was filled
tl1 unique features. A tape recording revealed what teen-
ers wanted most. The recordings were the result of on-

 
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
  

-spot interviews at several of our own recreation centers.
iother highlight of this session was the demonstration of
' new game, Jokari, by the noted tennis star, Pauline Betz
die. It was hoped that the many activities prescnted so
)ly by directors, at this session, would be included for
n-agers in the summer programs at every recreation

Feerl-The-Witch, played with large head

painted or pasted on wall. See story.

Halloween parties of some sort have been enjoyed by the
peoples of many lands for centuries. Interpretations and
observations vary in the different countries; but to the
people of America today comes a Halloween party fash-
ioned, and pretty well standardized, by the folkways of
America through the years. It is a Halloween party of
witches and goblins, of skeletons and ghosts, of costumes
and dens of horror, of broomsticks and black cats, of vam-
pires and bats, of bohbing for apples and other games of
fun, and of feats of skill and contest. All of this rolled into
one bill of fare for one evening’s entertainment is a large
order for even a small group, and as the number of partici-
pants increases, the problems increase pr0portionately.

For the social or recreational agency which undertakes
such a party for two or three hundred, the problems are
many-fold; and the common question is, “How can you in-
clude all these ingredients in a party for this number?” It
can bc done, but 1 helieve that the four most immediate con-
cerns facing anyone embarking upon such an undertaking
are: (1) content of program; (2) participation for all; (3)
control of the group; and (4) distribution of refreshments.

We, at Madison Square Boys Club, have worked out a
plan that has the answer to all of these problems. Our party
embodies all the old time Halloween games, thrills, and at-
mosphere (complete with dens of horrors) and keeps three
hundred boys actively participating, simultaneously, for a
period of three hours. In the meanwhile we give them their
fill of cider and doughnuts.

Our plan is simple, easy to implement, and has worked
successfully for us for the past two Halloweens. The es-
sence of it is to set up fifteen or twenty games with a Hal-
loween motif, separate the three hundred into groups of
fifteen, assign a team to each game, and then to rotate them
around the room until each team and each individual has

played every game. The games are played on a competitive,
point basis, with prizes for the winners.
Three distinct areas are pertinent to the carrying out of

the total plan :

1. A room, or series of connecting rooms and hallways, to

be used as a den of horrors.
2. A pre-party assembly area.
3. A gymnasium, or area of similar size, for the actual party

action.
An elaboration of each of these areas is included in the

following general description of the party.

We open the doors to the waiting crowd at seven o’clock.
Everyone is channeled immediately
through the den of horrors, with its ghosts
and witches, rattling chains, screeching
owls and squeaky doors—ell dedicated to
the purpose of making a youngster’s hair
stand on end. Younger children are helped
through by a staff member. If a youngster
is disinclined to pass through the den he is
not urged to do so, but is given a detour.
Most of our youngsters get great joy from
the den and would go through for a second
trip if permitted.

After the den of horrors, all the people
gather in a general assembly area. At
seven thirty they are divided into teams of
fifteen, and are given a number corre-
sponding to the numher of a game in thc
party area. There are as many teams as
there are games. All members of team
number one are given a card bearing the
number “1”; and upon going to the party
area, they report to game number one in a
group. All members of team number two
are given a card bearing the number “2”,
and so On, until all teams and all individ-

 

RECREATIO.

uals are numbered and assigned to a game with a corre-
sponding number. No team is assigned number thirteen, as
this number is reserved for the refreshment booth. This as-
sembly area is the key to the total organization of the party,
and adequate planning and care here will help to assure
a successful evening. Also, at this point, team captains are
chosen and older persons are assigned to lead the group
through the activities. This affords a wonderful opportunity
to make use of older boys, giving them a chance at respon-
sibility and leadership.

By eight o’clock all three hundred are in the party area
and stationed at the game assigned to them. At a signal
from the MC everybody begins to play and the fun is on.
When sufiicient time has elapsed for all teams to complete
their games, another signal is given and all rotate clockwise
one station and commence a new and different game.

A full day should be allowed to set up the party area.
Decorations should be in abundance and should include sil-
houettes of all types of Halloween creatures. Never under-
estimate the power of suggestion embodied in decorations,
for setting a mood.

The games in the party area are clearly numbered, and
should be spaced far enough apart so that pe0ple playing one
game will not be a hindrance to the people playing the next.
Each game must have a “games keeper” to keep the game set
up, and to keep a score for the teams as they pass. The team
leaders also keep score. This provides a double check for

scores. As many as possible of the traditional Halloween
games, such as “Duck for Apples,” should be included, and
a Halloween motif for all games is a must. With a little im-
agination almost any run-of-the-mill game can be trans-
formed into a Halloween game. Here are some of the games
we use successfully:

1. Bucking for Apples—This game is so well known that no
eXplanation is needed. it is sullicient to mention that each
contestant is permitted one minute and is scored on the
number of apples he is able to take. from the tub.

2. Cat on the Fence—Place two cardboard silhouettes of
black cats, some tin cans, a small pumpkin, and some old

shoes on a wooden bench. The participants stand five yards
back and attempt to knock the objects off the “fence” by
throwing tennis balls. Each object has a point value, with

throws.

3. Feed the Witch—A large picture of a witch’s head is
painted or pasted on the wall. it should be at least six feet
high and proportionally wide. The teeth should be her
prominent feature. Drive a tenpenny nail into each tooth
from behind, leaving the point and approximately one inch
protruding in the front. Suspend a string from the center
of her forehead and on the end of the string place an apple.
This creates a pendulum. The object of the game is to im-
pale the apple onto the nails protruding from the teeth. This
is more diHicult than it seems. Each tooth has a point value
with the more difficult to impale teeth having the greatest
point value. (See illustration.)

295

4. Witches Tail—-In a small box put three holes large
enough to permit a ping pong ball to pass through. Place
the box on the floor so that the holes are at floor level and
facing the participant. ,The participant must straddle a
broom, witch-style with the sweeping part to the rear, and
attempt to sweep the ping-pong ball into the holes. The dis-
tance should be eight feet and the number of tries three.
The holes are of different sizes with the smaller holes having
the greatest point'value.

5. Penny PumpkinwDecorate a chair to resemble a witch.
Place a jack-o’-lantern pumpkin on the floor behind the
chair, with its face up. The object of the game is for the
participant to drop pennies into the eyes, nose, and mouth of
the pumpkin without touching the chair with his body. Each
person is allowed six tries.

6. Apple Bowling—mPlayed the same as regular bowling.
The apples are placed upon small blocks of wood and an
apple is used as a bowling ball.

We use several other games but these are given as typical
of how, with ingenuity, any game can become a Halloween
game.

Station number thirteen is the refreshment booth, and as
previously stated, no team is assigned this number. As each
team reaches this station, while rotating around the room,
it pauses here for a one-game period to enjoy doughnuts
and cider at a leisurely pace. This permits serving refresh-
ments without breaking the routine of the party, and also
avoids the rush and grab entailed in mass feedings.

When all the teams have completed all the games, they
are lined up for Halloween relays. Some that we use are
pumpkin rolling relays, apple-pushing-with-nose relays, and
assembling and disassembling of cardboard skeletons.

We finish off the evening with a grand Halloween treasure
hunt. Previously hidden throughout the party area are nu-
merous small paper cutouts of witches, bats, brooms, cats,

and so on. Each cutout has a point value: a witch—8
points, a cat———6 points, and so on. A special white witch has
a value of 100 points. This special we really camouflage in
some conspicuous but hard to detect place such as some
one’s white dress. Participants may search for the treasure
only while music is played. When the music st0ps, all stop
in place until the music commences again.

Here are a list of essentials that will increase the chances
of success for the party.

1. Use a loud speaker system. It is practically impossible to
control a group of three hundred without one. It is also ad-
visable to have an extra set on hand just in case the first one
goes bad.

2. Insist that all remain in their respective team groups
throughout the evening, except during the treasure hunt.

3. Choose your games keepers and team leaders with an eye
for possible maturity and leadership ability. They can go
a long way toward making or breaking the party. Meet with
them at least twice before party time to make certain that
they understand the total party, and that they know their
individual obs well.

4. Have at least three staff members roving the area to keep
things rolling. Meet with these people before the party to
make certain that they are well aware of the order and se-
quence of the activities. They should be as much aware of
what is taking place next as the MC.

This is a rough outline of our Halloween party. Each
agency will have problems unique unto themselves; but I
believe that the plan can be used successfully by most of
them. We at Madison have found that it works for us, and
we offer it for what it is worth. We like it because it embod-
ies the best parts of our traditional American Halloween.
because it keeps three hundred youngsters actively partici-
pating for three hours, and because it keeps these three
hundred happy for three hours.

New Interagency Committee

of cards in the handle. Impress upon
him that he is not to tell you that num-
ber. When he indicates that he has de-
cided on some number, ask him to: be-
gin with the bottom card of the handle
and count silently up the handle and
then continue clockwise around the rim
until the selected number has been
counted out; then, beginning with the
card on which he landed and counting
that as “one,” to count out the original
number again, this time in counter-
clockwise direction, continuing around
the rim without bothering about the
handlc. Despite the fact that his count-

ing has all been done silently, you_ will
be able to tell him on which card he
finally landed.

You begin with the bottom card of
the handle, too, and mentally count the
number of cards in the handle. Then,
starting with the card at the right of
the card to which the handle is attached,
go counter-clockwise around the rim,
counting as many cards as there are in
the handle. The card on which you land
will be the same as the one on which
your subject landed, no matter what
number he has chosen.

Suggestion: Never use the same layout
of the frying pan twice in succession-—
keep varying the number of cards.

them face up in pairs. Now ask some-

to remember, but not to tell you, what

PROGRAM

the two cards in the pair are. Then,
carefully, so as not to separate any of
the pairs, gather up the cards into a
single pack and hold it face down in

your left hand.

Now, imagine that there is an ar-
rangement of words on the table, shown
in Diagram A, (note that there are ten
pairs of letters: two B’s, two 1’s, two L’s,
and so forth.) The order in which the

cards are placed is shown in Diagram B.

 

Begin turning up the twenty cards,
one by one, and placing them on the
table. Use the first card to cover, face
up, the space where the first imaginary
B in BIBLE would be, the second card
to cover the second B of BIBLE. The
third card should cover the I of BIBLE,
and the fourth the I of THIGH. The
fifth card then covers the L of BIBLE,
so that the sixth card must also cover
an L, which is in ATLAS. Continue
turning up the remainder of the twenty
cards in like fashion, always covering a
pair of the imaginary letters.

Have your subject point out the hori-
zontal rows in which the two cards he
originally selected now are. If he indi-
cates two separate rows, then you’ll
know that his cards are those covering
the identical letters that appear in each
of these rows. If he says they are both
in the same row, then they are cards
covering whatever letters appear twice

in that row.

Example: (Refer to diagram)
Your subject indicated that his cards are

in rows two and four. Since the only letter
common to both rows is T, his cards (11 and
12) must be thow covering the T spaces in

the imaginary diagram.

Suggestion: This trick may be worked
on several people simultaneously. The
main part is to commit the key words

and spaces to memory.

Quick and Easy Halloween Craft Projects

 

MASKS and

A piece of cardboard, paper, cloth, a paper plate, or a
bag; odds and ends for colorful trimmings; adhesive; paint
or crayons; and a bit of imagination are the basic require-
ments for these easy-to-make masks.

Paper plate masks (1) Use an eight- or ten-inch plate.
Measure and mark positions for eyes, nose and mouth. Cut
small holes for eyes and mouth; cut around sides and bottom
of nose and fold it outward. Make a small hole on each side
of the mask, and attach strings or elastic to hold it in place.

Paper bag masks (2) Use a bag large enough to slip easily
over the wearer’s head. Mark position for eyes. Cut out or
fringe lower edge at sides for the shoulders. Since the bags
are looseiitting, it is not necessary to cut out the nose.

Cylinder masks (3) Cut a rectangular piece of wrapping
or construction paper, tagboard, or oilcloth,—about ten
inches wide and long enough to go around the person’s head
and lap over two inches. Mark places for eyes, nose and
mouth. Trim the bottom so it fits well on shoulders. Add the
features and decorations and fasten mask together with
paper fasteners, tape or string.

Cloth sack masks (4) A sugar or flour sack, or an old
pillow slip serves as the base for this mask. Tie a knot in
the closed corners for ears. Apply features with paint.
crayon, or embroidery. Gather the open ends in place
around the neck with a bow tie, ribbon or collar.

Stocking masks (5) Cut off the foot part of a large size
stocking, and sew or tightly tie the cut edge of the uppeI
stocking for the top of the mask. Cut eye and mouth out-
lines from colored press-on mending tape and press them in
place before cutting eye and mouth holes in stocking.

Flat paper masks (6) Mark position for eyes, nose.
mouth, ears and chin on a piece of wrapping or construc‘
tion paper and then design and cut the mask to the desired
shape and decorate it. Interesting effects can be obtained
by folding a flat mask (as shown by dotted lines in illustra-
tion) to make the cheeks and chin stand out.

Eye masks (7) Made from scraps of paper, cloth, oil-
cloth, plastic, and so on, these little masks are especially ap-
pealing to the junior girls and teen-agers. False eyelashes.
beads, feathers, or sequins give them a very gala appear-
ance.

Animal-head masks (8) Draw animal head design (as
shown in illustration) on a large piece of heavy wrapping
paper or tagboard. Cut out on solid lines, fold on dotted
lines, and paste tabs (shaded areas in illustration) securely
to form head mask.

Noisemakers

Construct attractive noisemakers which jingle, rattle, clat
ter, hum, or whir from scrap materials and decorate then
gaily with enamel, colored paper, or cellulose tape.

(1) Punch holes around the rim of a tin or paper plate
Fasten a small bell to each hole with a piece of wire.

(2) Punch two holes in the end of a tin can. Make a 100
handle from coat hanger wire, insert the ends through thI

RECREATIOI

NOISEMAKERS

holes in the can and twist them together. Punch holes in the
eenter of metal bottle caps and string them on a piece of
strong cord, knotting the cord between thc caps. Tie one
end of the cord to the twisted wire inside the can.

(3) Punch small hole in the end of a tin can. Thread
short pieces of cord or fine wire through an eyescrew, knot
them in place, and tie a washer or nut to each of the ends.
Attach handle, cut from broomstick, by screwing eyescrew,
from inside of can, through the hole and into the handle.

(4) Punch three holes along one side of a cardboard tube.
Tape or glue a piece of wax paper over one end. Trim with
a fringe of colored paper. Hum into the open end.

(5) Use a flat saucepan cover or flatten the edge of a
eoffee can covcr with a hammer, and punch one hole 3Aw-inch
from the edge. Cut a V-shaped groove, an inch deep, in the
end of a piece of broomstick. Drill a hole crosswise through
the center of the two prongs, 1/_,)-inch from the end. Cut two
pieces of strong wire the length of the cover’s diamcter and
twist a small loop in one end of each piece. Put the parts
togethcr by inserting bolt through: one prong, the loop of
one wire, the hole in the cover, the second wire loop, and the
other prong, and fasten with a nut. Attach a heavy washer
or nut to free end of each wire.

(6} Punch one hole in bottom of tin can. Rub an 18-inch
pieee of firm cord with rosin, thread it through the hole in
the can, and tie a curtain ring on each end. Pull the cord
up and down to make a squawking noise.

('7) Thread four 10-inch lengths of ribbon through a
large spool. Knot them all together and attach a bell or
metal curtain ring to each of the ends.

(8) String several small bells on a piece of wire and
fasten it to the loops on a package handle. Trim with tas-
eels of yarn or crepe paper.

(9) Cut out the center of a 3- by 5-inch piece of heavy
cardboard, leaving a %-inch border. Punch a small hole in
one end of this and attach a 3-foot piece of string. Tie a small
block of wood to the other end of the string for a handle. Put
four rubber bands lengthwise over the cardboard. Whirl it
rapidly in a circle to make a moaning noise.

I 10) chlove the cover from a cigar or shoe box and put
heavy rubber bands crosswise around the box. Play it by
strumming or by drawing a stick quickly across the bands.

1'11) Tack the centers of three 10-inch pieces of ribbon
to the top of a 12-inch piece of dowling or a stick. Tie a
small bell to each end of the ribbons.

t12) Cut a hole, the diameter of a broomstick handle, in
the eenter of the cover of an ice-cream carton. Nail one end
of a IZ-mch piece of broomstick to the inside bottom of the

carton. put in several small pebbles, slide the cover on, over
the stlek, and tape it securely in place.

(13) Tie a handle of heavy cord or wire through a cot-

tagel-cheese carton, put several pebbles in, and tape the cover
m p aee.

(14) .Drop small pebbles into an empty salt box and seal
spout wrth tape to make a simple rattle.

Expanded Program

An expanded 1954 municipal recrea-
tion program for the Milwaukee De-
partment of Municipal Recreation has
been approved by the school board.

The program pr0posed by Donald B.
Dyer, the assistant superintendent in
charge of the department, provides for
five new spring and summer play-
grounds, seven fall playgrounds, two
new afternoon social centers, two eve-
ning social centers and one auditorium
center. Much of the expansion is plan-
ned to bring recreational facilities to
new areas of Milwaukee which have big
population increases and new schools.

Mr. Dyer stated that the proposed ex-
pansion could be carried out without
increasing the school tax for recrea-
tional facilities. The recreation fund
has a taxing power of up to nine-tenths
of a mill.

Traveling Art Exhibitions

French Painting at Mid-Century,
Daumier Lithographs, F i fty Books of the
Year, Sculpture, 1953, Shopping Cen-
ters of Tomorrow and Design in Scan-
dinavia are among the new titles of sixty
American Federation of Arts Traveling
Exhibitions, gathered from sources in
this country and abroad for circulation
in 1953-54.

Institutions in every part of the
United States, and in Canada, make use
of the AFA’s Traveling Exhihitions
service to bring to the public important
original exhibitions and smaller educa-
tional displays of the art of many na-
tions and periods. In 1952 over four
hundred showings were booked.

Contemporary art, both fine and ap-
plied, is well represented in the new
exhibits. Selections from shows of na-
tional importance such as the Metro-
politan’s Museum’s American Water-

300

colors, Drawings and Prints, 1952,:the
Corcoran Biennial, 1953 and the Whit-
ney Museum’s 1953 Watercolors and
Drawings give a good cross-section of
art in America today. Color Prints in
Post-War Germany, Contemporary
Swiss Architecture, Finnish Arts and
Crafts, Modern Aubusson Tapestries,
British Children’s Art trace trends in
other countries.

Institutions wishing information on
AFA Exhibitions or other services
should write to Thomas M. Messer, As-

sistant Director in Charge of Exhibi-
tions, at 1083 Fifth Avenue, New York.

Are You a Gloop?

An eye-catching and amusing mail-
ing piece was used in Butler, Pennsyl-
vania, last spring, to announce a unique
outdoor workshop for Group Leaders
0f Outdoor Programs. Headed bylarge-
lettered question, “Are You A Gloop?”
(with appr0priate sketches), it admon-
ished the reader to “Save three nights
of your life, for the time of your life.”

The workshop hours were announced
as from six thirty to eight thirty, and
included the following:

Wednesday, May 13—-—Menu planning; cook-
ing procedures; fire building; games in the
out-of-doors; campfires

Wednesday, May 20 (next night in case of
rain)—Cook your dinner by aluminum foil,
tin can, stick or pot; demonstrations (Scout
Campcraft Area) campcraft; safety, equip-
ment; housekeeping; star gazing (optional)
Tuesday, May 26—Nature in recreation . . .
trails, walks, conservation; dramatics . . .
skits, paper-bag puppets, pantomimes; cere-
monial campfire.

Upon completion of the workshop, a
humorous certificate was awarded, tes-
tifying to the fact that the recipient was
now a G100p.

Eisenhower Park

In July the Senate passed and sent to
the White House a bill authorizing the
Secretary of the Army to turn over to
Texas, at “fair market value,” land to
be known as “Eisenhower State Park.”
The one hundred and sixty acres, which
the Federal Government would convey
by quitclaim deed, lies within the Deni-
son Dam and Reservoir Project.

New County Program

A new county park program was es-
tablished in Oregon when the Lane
County Park and Recreation Depart-
ment was created by action of the Lane
County Court on April 29, 1953. A
charter commission of eleven members
was named at the same time, and the fol-
lowing primary duties were defined:
(1) to promote, deve10p, and maintain
a system of county parks and recreation
facilities; (2) to administer, under the
County Court, such park, recreation,

scenic, and historic facilities as may
come under its jurisdiction, and to pro-
mote the acquisition of such sites and
facilities for use by the public; and (3)
to conduct a survey of the recreation.
scenic, and historical resources pres-
ently available in the county, and
needed in the future. Mr. Roy A.
Elliott, of Eugene, has been named
chairman of the commission. The park
and recreation superintendent has not
yet been selected.

New Facilities

A half-million dollars voted by Ta-
coma, Washington, citizens for new im-
provements to parks and playgrounds in
1952, is now being spent by the Board
of Park Commissioners. Included in'
the program are facilities such as two-
$20,000 recreation buildings on play-
grounds; four wading pools, eighty byl
forty feet; a $130,000 animal building
at Point Defiance Zoo; a $200,00d
warm, salt water, concrete swimming
pool; the development of new play-
grounds and a combination service and
oldsters building in Wright Park. TheI
latter park is located down-town and is
frequented by oldsters in great num-
bers. '

Master Plan

According to the June 1953 issue of
Popular Government, published by the
University of North Carolina, the Win-
ston-Salem recreation commission has
approved a long-range master plan call-
ing for expenditures of approximately
$2,800,000 by Forsyth County over the
next ten to twelve years. The plan has
been included in a 135-page report pre-
pared over the past year by recreational
consultants.

Beach to he Preserved

The long struggle to preserve, un-
spoiled, the charm of Island Beach. a
ten-mile tip of Barnegat peninsula,
south of Seaside Heights and the last
lengthy stretch of wild ocean beach and
dune land in that area, has been capped
with success. The state of New Jersey
is buying the 2,200 acres for $2,750,000
to preserve it as a combination outdoor
museum, wildlife sanctuary and study
center, and public recreation, fishing
and bathing area, to be renamed Phipps I
State Park.

Adult Education
There are at present approximately
3,165,900 adults enrolled in vocational

education programs sponsored by pub-
lic schools; and about 3,000,000 more

participate in some type of evening or
outside regular scheduled classes in
community colleges, evening schools,
adult education centers and college ex-
tension courses.

RECREATION

 

NOTHING NEW on this subject? Maybe not—but have

you had one recently—a real, well-planned one on a
community-wide level, full of imagination as to projects and
setting?

EVERYBODY loves dolls! They have a nostalgic charm
that takes us back to. our childhood. And a Doll Show, if it

is well-organized, if it has imagination, color and human

interest, will attract almost everybody in the community.

Such a show can be simple or elaborate. It can be a sepa-
rate, (listinct activity, such as F ayetteville, North Carolina
ltelrl, or it can be tied into a doll-making program, as in
Honolulu, and it can be slanted toward a special girl-mother
angle, as it was in Hanford, California.

Whichever type you use, pull in all the other agencies and
groups in your community. Give them special projects. Tic
'in with the department stores and toy shops. Find a theme.
Add Specialties, if you can—like storytelling, or a puppet
show, a magician, a balloon tree, a doll circus, dances, and
so on. Use junior and senior high school youngsters in sct-
ting up and taking down the exhibit, and in acting as guides
and hostesses or hosts. Run it long enough for everyone to
come—and at hours when adults are free.

And follow it up with doll-making, puppets, story drama-
tizations, and so on, in your everyday program.

In Fayetteville, the city-wide doll show, sponsored by the
cily recreation department, was held in the Sears-Roebuck
Company store on February 15, from 9:30 AM. to 9:00 PM.
It was open to all residents of Cumberland County, regard-
less of age. Classifications were as follows:

R33 Doll Homemade Doll Largest Doll
Paper Doll Wax Doll Smallest Doll
China Doll Wonder Doll Bisque Doll

\Papit-r Mache Doll Oldest Doll Storybook Doll

Dolls from every country.

The show was oHicially opened by the cutting of a ribbon
[across the entrance by Mrs. Gilmore, wife of the command-
5113' general at Fort Bragg. She was accompanied by Mr.
Joe Tally, Jr., mayor of Fayetteville, and Mr. Selwyn Orcutt,

This was the Third Annual Doll Show, and it differed
from the others by having a number of planned projects in
addition to the regular exhibit. These projects were the
works of various community groups. The army wivcs group
of the Lutheran Service Center, for example, constructed
and entered an attractive project showing “The Old W’oman
Who Lived in a Shoe,” and all her many children—dolls, of
course!

A Girl Scout troop constructed a plywood church and
wedding scene. A Brownie Troop entered an exhibit of dolls
of other nations, winning first prize. Many families of serv-
icemen entered foreign dolls. The Fort Bragg schools, city
and county schools all sent exhibits. One of the most valu-
able and outstanding collections was entered by Mrs. Eliie

This exhibit was constructed and entered by the
local Army Wives Group, Lutheran Scrvice Centcr.

Brydges, wife of an army officer, and consisted of an impos-
ing array of old-fashioned china-headed dolls dressed in
authentic copies of the styles of the Gay Nineties. This col-
lection was valued at $15,000.

Mr. Orcutt feels that including these special projects added
a great deal of interest to the exhibit and he plans to include
more of them next year.

In Honolulu, the Board of Public Parks and Recreation
has sponsored a doll show for the last fifteen years. This
year the show was built around a theme, “A Doll in Doll
Land,” and featured homemade dolls of all nationalities,
dolls depicting fairy-tale characters, and rag dolls for
cuddhng.

It was the result of the doll-making classes held on the
playgrounds. Creative expression was emphasized. No pat-
terns!

The doll show was staged with unusual imagination. A
doll playground, complete with a pavilion, swings, slides
and stilts was a wonderful setting for the show—and em-
phasized recreation activities as well! A pink, blue and
purple gingerbread house at the entrance not only attracted
visitors but acted as a ballot box for the hotly contested
spectator’s choice. An ice cream cone tree added the final
touch to the setting, and provided a colorful background for
the display of small stocking and fabric dolls.

In Hanford, California, the recreation department was
brought up short by the following letter from Leilani Von
Tellrop, a ten-year old:

Dear Mr. Wallas, I was wondering about something. The only thing
they have besides the tournaments for children my age is the archery.
Why do you not have a doll show for the girls. I know‘ many of the
mothers say it is too tomboyish for the girls to shoot bows. My
mother does too. How about the doll show.

Mr. W. H. Wallace, director, rose to the occasion, and sent

Leilani his answer:

Dear Leilani: Your recreation department stands ready now and in
the future, to serve the wishes of the citizens, both young and old, of
Hanford. I sincerely appreciate the fine letter you have written to us
and we will do our best to arrange a doll show to your liking. This
letter serves as a public announcement to all doll enthusiasts in
Hanford that the recreation department is sponsoring a doll show on 1
Saturday afternoon, January, 1953. It will be held in the City Audi-
torium beginning at 1:00 P.M. We are planning it on this date for
two reasons. One, it will enable all the new Christmas dolls to be
shown. Two, it will providc the girls several days to make clothes
for their new dolls.

And so the recreation department put on a very special
“Doll Show and Mothersa Tea” in the City Auditorium.

RECREATION

Dolls were classified very simply in three major grouPs:
small; medium; and large. Each of these had two classi-
fications: those dolls with purchased clothes, those with
clothes made by their owners. Also, a prize was awarded
the best rag and stocking doll. Only one prize could be won
by any one girl.

A local dance studio put on a short program during the
judging. The scheduling of the afternoon ran like this:

1:00 P.M.—-doors open; 1:30 P.M.—program and judging;
2:00 P.M.—Doll Parade and Mothersg Tea; 2:30 P.M.—-
awarding of prizes.

A simple program, to be sure—but full of human interest.
lts date gave a chance to display those Christmas dolls, and
time for their owners to make new clothes for them. The
mothers were featured—so mothers,-and little mothers, were
pleased. Comment? A recreation department has a heart.

Small Town Problems

 

AST fall, when Art Todd, midwest district representative
for the National Recreation Association, visited Water-
loo, Iowa, he and Ray Forsberg, director of recreation, dis-
cussed the problem of reaching outlying smalltown recreation
departments for the purpose of helping them with their
problems. They considered the idea of inviting representa-
tives of towns within fifty or sixty miles of Waterloo to come
together for a day in the spring. Mr. Forsberg later took up
the idea with his board, the mayor, chamber of commerce
and others——all of whom thought it would be a good thing.
The Waterloo Courier, daily newspaper, agreed to pay the
cost of bringing in a speaker.

About a month before the date set for the conference, a
letter was sent out by Dick Zellhoeffer, chairman of the
Waterloo board, to mayors of forty or fifty towns inviting
them to send representatives to discuss summer recreation
programs. Later a similar letter was sent to 1) superin-
tendents of schools, 2) secretaries of chambers of commerce,
'3) presidents of PTA’s. Duke Regnier, recreation specialist
of Illinois University Extension, was invited to give the talk
at the noon luncheon.

The meeting was scheduled to begin at 10:00 and to con-
tinue until 3:00 in the afternoon. Its purpose was to discuss
planning, organization, financing of summer programs. It
Was expected that lay people interested in programs rather
than leaders would attend; and it was decided that if sufli-
cient interest was displayed, a one day workshop for play-
ground leaders would be arranged later in the spring.

A good group, of twenty-nine people from eleven com-
munities, showed up. Even better, however, was the genuine
interest shown, the kinds of questions and problems which
they presented. Craft articles from the Waterloo depart-
,ment, and NRA and other literature, were on display.

The following are typical of local programs described:

Oelwine has a seven-member legal recreation commission
and a levy. Program runs through the summer months and
consists of softball, swimming in pool, activities on two
playgrounds, instrumental music instruction, crafts, typing
classes, tennis instruction. A summer director, usually
someone from the schools, is employed.

Hudson, population five hundred, has a midget baseball

tributions. There is tennis and golf instruction, and a story
hour throughout the Year. Buses take children to Charles
City to swim. Handcrafts and ceramics are taught; baseball
and softball is sponsored by Lions, Legion and Commercial
Club.

Allison has a baseball program for boys eight to eighteen,
Scouts and Y-Teen programs conducted thrOugh the schools.

Waverly is especially interested in expanding its program
and in solving a number of problems. One is the establish-
ment of a park or recreation commission.

Those present at the meeting included a superintendent of
schools, several teachers, members of womens clubs, PTA’s
and other groups sponsoring programs. They were intro-
duced to persons in Waterloo who could be of help to them
at any time on specific problems.

The one day leadership workslwp will be held in late May
or early June. The group was enthusiastic. We felt that the
meeting was sufficiently worthwhile to make it an annual
event and to encourage recreation departments in other cities
to sponsor similar meetings with NRA assistance.

To PRODUCE a play demands the em-
ployment of all arts and this is truly
realized by the Milwaukee Players of the
Milwaukee Department of Municipal
Recreation. Herein lies the foundation
upon which their School of Drama rests.
The school itself is quite unique in a
nation of community theatres. An air
of seriousness pervades it—a serious-
ness which should accompany the suc-
cessful undertaking of any avocation.
\V e believe, as members of the Milwau-
kee Players, that the training of people
in little theatre today is sorely lacking.
we admit that ours might not be the
only method—but we can testify to the
fact that ours is an old method which
has survived and which has met all of
our needs. We are willing to go along
with Bernard Shaw in his preface to

The Dark Lady 0 f the Sonnets:

It is by exhausting all the hypotheses that we
reach the verifiable one; and after all the
wrong road always leads somewhere.

The first premise one must accept
when working with a beginner is that,
within this neophyte, there lurks some
God-given talent—however crude or un-
polished it may be. Otherwise the neo-
phyte cannot be dealt with as a potential
artist. Assuming this natural ability,
the first premise flows into a second——
the necessity of shaping and polishing
the gem. An ahundance of little thea-
tres seem to ignore this second item and
thus they are unable to arrive syllogisti-
cally at the finished product, acceptable
actors and actresses. Within this abund-
ance there is often evidenced complete
satisfaction with the uncultured prod-

the Wisconsin Idea Theater Quarterly.

waukee Players, has attended the

uct; but logic demands that art be reg-
ulated, pruned, shaped here, enlarged
there and molded symmetrically every-
where. A pianist who plays “by ear”
might be termed clever, but being of
sane mind he would never venture on a
concert stage to perform Franck’s Sym-
phonic Variations—unless he were a
genius! And there are few, if any,
geniuses in little theatre.

Thus School of
Drama, with these premises in mind,
become more convinced yearly of the
necessity of this procedure as a method
to aid those little-theatre aspirants who
are unable to receive training in the-
atrical arts elsewhere. Also this pro-
cedure professes an underlying faith in
the fight to alleviate “amateur theatri-
cals” of unfavorable connotations. An
uncut gem cannot be sold to a buying
public; and the Milwaukee Players have
been aware of this for twenty seasons.

Under the guidance of Robert E.
Freidel, supervisor of drama and music
in the Department of Municipal Recrea-
tion, the School of Drama was founded
in 1932. Since that time, its course of
study has remained essentially un-
changed—which attests to its success.

Anyone in the city of Milwaukee who
has either reached the age of eighteen
or has been graduated from high school
is eligible to enter the School of Drama.
Admittance is gained by the potential
student’s being cast in a Milwaukee
Playcrs’ production. Once cast, the po-
tcntial student becomes an apprentice
and from that time on his training pro-
gresscs. At an initial meeting the new

members of the

apprcntice is acquainted with the naturelll
of the various classes and the point sys-
tem—the two factors which set him on
his way to becoming a Milwaukee
Player.

From mid-September to mid-June th‘
classes are held every Wednesday eve-
ning at the Jackson Street Social Center
and the Wisconsin Avenue Social Cen-i
ter, both centrally located in downtown
Milwaukee. Between 7:30 P.M. and ap-
proximately 10 P.M., the apprentice at-
tends courses given in voice and diction.
bodily movement and acting. The
spheres or ranges of these courses are
extensive to the point of permitting the
treatment of all aspects of theatre arts.

The School of Drama is conducted b'
Mr. Freidel and his two assistants, Otto
DiDio, director of the Milwaukee Light
Opera Chorus and instructor in voice
and diction, and Gwendolyn Hall, in-
structor in the dance. As director of
Milwaukee Players’ productions, Mr.
Freidel works in close coordination with
his assistants, affirming again his belief
in the universality of the arts by includ-
ing the study of music and the dance
with that of drama.

The material treatcd within the
courses usually depends upon the pro-
duction in rehearsal at the time. For in-
stance, when the yearly Shakespearean
tragedy is in progress, Mr. DiDio con-
centrates his classes on Elizabethan
music while Mrs. Hall devotes her time
to related dances of the period. What
is then dealt with in these classes is
often incorporated into the production

itself.

RECREATIO.

 
 

The Milwaukee Department at Munici-
pal Recreation places emphasis upon
recrealian for all citizens. If enough
people wont to pursue a certain activ-
ily, it is always ready to supply trained
leadership and facilities. Drama has
long been spansared as worthwhile,
and Mr. Pitman describes this octivity
as it is conducted by the deportment.

Elasses in voice and diction are not
posed of isolated theory. There is a
tant emphasis on projection, audi-

l y, intelligibility and, under the di-
ion of Mr. Freidel, interpretation
ch generally takes the form of thea-

E readings with class criticism. Ac-

)‘ding to Mr. DiDio, the best methods

I phases of movement, the ultimate

uihythmics are often employed in

lgesturing, walking and, in general,

I
1 complete coordination.

Acting courses contain no pretense of
ying to teach the apprentice how to
1. An artist cannot be taught his art—
Jl only how to function in it. Thus the
HKJSC of these classes is to instruct the
)prenticc in ”how to act prOperly,” to
:rolop along proper lines what talent
i§1t be inherent in an individual. This
Icludes theatre readings (with class
'ilFism), theatrical traditions, stage
sportment and discipline, dramatic
andards, techniques and styles, and a
isler of the theatre.

rth these three substantial courses
to P is lnixcd in, now and then, the
lied theatrical arts of make-up, fenc-
lg and the reading of dramatic litcra-
Ire.- Within the realm of make-up, the
'pi stressed are straight old age and
laracter, with an emphasis being
laced on beards for men and hair-dos
pr women. Not only does fencing,
ong with thc dance, improve bodily
onment but, with the abundance of
aical prcsentations yearly—particu-
rl'} thc traditional Shakespearean pro-
IIctions—fencing is a necessity for the
lkc of reality and audience acceptance.

tronsa 1953

  
   
  
 
 
   
 

Although the importance of reading
dramatic litcrature is constantly empha-
sized, there is a basic required reading
list, now and thcn suhject to change.
This basic list, it is hoped, will encour-
age the apprentice to develop the habit
of reading within his own genre. The
list includes:

A history of the theatre (almost any
is acceptable)

An Actor Prepares—Constantin Stan-
islavski

Beyond the H orizon—Eugene O’Neill

The Fabulous I nvalid—Kau fman and
Hart

The American Way—Kaufman and
Hart

Our Town—Thorton Wilder

Abraham Lincoln in I llz'nois—Robert
Sherwood

School for Scandal—Richard Sheri-
dan

Cammer Curton’s Needle— Colin
Clements

The Importance of Being Earnest-—
Oscar Wilde

No attempt is made to claim that this
list is a comprehensive survey. The'rea-
son for the selection goes deeper. The
habit of reading dramatic literature
must be one of slow acquirement. It has
been found that an innnediate emphasis
on, for examplc, Greek or Elizabethan
drama has frightened many a potential
actor away. All such developments must
he made cautiously and patiently.

The Milwaukee Players have no placc
for a “star” or “prima donna.” Thcy
attempt, insofar as is practical, to follow
the repertory system which thereby en-
ables the cssential actor to expericnce
and utilize the rclated arts of theatre.
Thus all apprentices must devote a cer-
tain amount of time to working 011 sets,
props, costumes, ushcring, ticket-taking
and ticket-selling.

When the schedule of plays is not so
heavy, workshop productions—gener—
ally taking the form of three- or four-
page sidcs are rehearsed under the di-

 

rection of long-standing Milwaukee
Players, thus giving the latter an oppor-
tunity to develop for thcmselves anothcr
phasc of the drama.

 

paooaam

~All of the above is eventually materi-
alized for the apprentice by a point
system which, when achieved, automati-

cally makes the student a Milwaukee
Player.

The Point System

For Acting
Major Productions
15 points—major role
8 points—minor role
4 points—bit role
2 pointsu—walk-on
WorkshOp Productions
5 points—major role
3 points—minor role

For Classes Attended

1 point for each completed evening
session

For House Work

1 point for ushering, ticket-taking
and ticket-selling

For Make- up
10 points for make-up in general
(straight, old age, character, hair-
dos and beards, final exam)

Reading

5 points for reading of all required
books

Selling Tickets
1 point for every ten tickets sold
per production

 

The last requisite, selling tickets, is
quite obvious. The would-he actor is
constantly made aware of the neccssity
of an essential—the audience. And en-
couragement is given to him to develop
his own “following.” .

When all the requircd points are
totaled, the apprentice will. have re-

ceived:

50 points for acting

25 points for classes attended

5 points for working in the house

10 points for make-up

5 points for required reading

10 points for working hackstage

10 points for selling tickets

35 Optional points which can be obtained hy
applying an excess of points for any of the
above.

Thus the total required to become a
Milwaukee Player is 150 points.

I

It generally takes an apprentice about
one year to complete his requirements.
Few are able to pass the final exams in

305

a shorter period. Hard-work, determina-
tion, concentration and perseverance
are the cardinal virtues in any appren-
tice’s progress. The trial-test period of
the apprentice presents the director with
an excellent opportunity to gauge and
estimate the ability and interest of the
potential Milwaukee Player.

Approximately thirty-five apprentices
are admitted to the Milwaukee Players’
School of Drama each year. It is felt
that any larger number would defeat
the personal attention given to each stu-
dent. In all cases, anyone desiring to
become a player must undergo this
training period, regardless of previous
training and eXperience. The school is
primarily one for ne0phytes in the thea-
tre. Exceptions to the rule would intro-
duce the difficult problem of determin-
ing just where an experienced person
could gain admittance automatically to
the players and where he would have to
take the required courses. Notwith-
standing these possible exceptions, the
Milwaukee Players demand that all
those interested in becoming a part of
the organization must first of all submit
to a period of apprenticeship. In fact,
experienced actors who have managed
to survive the “basic training” have ad-
mitted that such initial courses often
refresh in their minds essential princi-
ples so often lost sight of by one who
has progressed in his art. On the side
of encouragement, an experienced actor
might very well shorten his apprcntice-
ship with his already-gained knowledge
of theatre. But let it be plainly under-
stood that the apprenticeship in no way
impairs any actor’s opportunity of at-
taining any role in a production. Try-
outs for Milwaukee Playersa productions
are open to all Milwaukeeans. Many
times it has happened that apprentices
have been cast in leading roles.

Mr. Freidel is fully convinced that
only through this thorough and basic
concentration on the arts within the
School of Drama has he been able to
produce and direct the great classics of
theatre—productions that other little
theatres have generally sidestepped be-
cause of a lack of confidence and will-
ingness to experiment. It has become a
tradition for the Milwaukee Players to
place an emphasis on the classics—or
as one local actor stated: “Any drama

306

club can perform the run-of-the-mill
‘Dear Ruth’s’ but it takes a gI‘OIIp like
the Milwaukee Players to present suc-
cessfully a classic.” The major produc-
tion each year is either a Shakespear-
ean tragedy or history and, if the time
and opportunity are available, a Shakes-
pearean comedy or romantic fantasy is
offered during the summer.

The Milwaukee Players were organ-
ized in 1931 with eleven members se-
lected as the outstanding actors in the
city’s various social centers and, to date,
they have given 166 plays, with 511 per-
formances. Seventeen of these plays
have been Shakespeare’s—with forty-
one individual productions throughout
the past twenty years. Others have been
drama, such as The Joyous Season,
Mary of Scotland, Our Town, Fashion,
Arms and the Man, The Barretts of
Wimpole Street, Swan Song, The Skin
of Our Teeth, You Touched Me, This
Happy Breed, Candida, Camille, Thea-
tre, The Man W ho Came To Dinner, A
Phoenix Too Frequent, N 0 Exit, M ourn-
ing Becomes Electra, Dark of the Moon,
Cyrano de Bergerac, Liliom, Finian’s
Rainbow, and Brigadoon. The 1952-53
season will give the reader a cross-sec-
tion of the variety and dramatic worth
contained within each year’s schedule:

The Madwoman of Chaillot, Bloomer
Girl, Blood Wedding, The Tempest,
Song of Norway, and The Grass Harp.

Concerning the training program, its
importance might easily be attested to
by the remarks of two prominent Mil-
waukee Players who themselves have
gone through the dramatic mill. Robert
Craw, at present vice-president of the
Players’ organization, contends that:
“When the production at hand is
coupled with the work done in the clas-
ses, the production as a whole immeas-
urably benefits. There is a certain spirit
prevailing about the theatre. One might
even go so far as to say that, during the
rehearsals of a Shakespearean show, a
notable Elizabethan attitude is engen-
dered—a spark that has been aided to-
wards its dramatic conflagration by the
music and dance of the period demon-
strated in the classes. The actors con-
stantly find themselves in an anachron-
istic milieu, even when not in actual re-
hearsal.”

Dorothy Voskobonik, secretary of the

organization, believes that the gr.
value of the School of Drama lies
“.  the discipline it develops in ea
actor. You seldom find actors playi
on various levels in Milwaukee Playe
productions. They have by this ti]
learned to coordinate the virtues ol
good show. They have learned to l

«velOp discipline and perseverance, 1

only in theatre but also in their da
lives.”

But perhaps the words of the direcl
himself will conclusively show, at lq
for the needs of the Milwaukee Playe
that what has been in Operation duri
the past eighteen years is a necessity a
will, therefore, continue as long as he
director—or as long as there rem:
those who feel that community the]
is essential to local art and must
deve10ped properly. Mr. Freidel sj
“The apprentice, by his attendanc
classes, knows shortly what to expect
the director, and by observation‘
quickly learn what I can expect frl
him, both in ability and in cooperatu
Theatre isn’t only acting, it is all':
combined and disciplined to effect
perfect a creation as is humanly I!
sible. Thus all sides must pull togetl‘.
and in the same direction. Our din

The Milwaukee Players are but 0
phase of a program in drama, music a‘
dance sponsored by the Milwaukee I
partment of Municipal Recreation. (i

Planning Elementary

School Buildings

George D. Butler

THE RECENTLY published book, Plan-

ning Elementary School Buildings,“
deals with a subject of interest to every
American citizen. This is true because
of the importance of our children’s edu-
cation and because every residential
neighborhood has or should have its
elementary school. This volume, pro-
fusely illustrated with some two hun-
dred and fifty photographs of schools
in action as well as with valuable tables,
charts and diagrams, deserves careful
study by architects, builders, school of-
ficials and parents of young children.
\Ve are describing, herewith, some of
its features because they have special
significance and interest for recreation
authorities and professional and lay
leaders in the field of community rec-
reation.

The authors, who are widely known
as consultants with long experience in
the field of education, have sought to
help their readers visualize the elemen-
tary schools that should be serving our
communities. They refer to a new and
distinctly American type of school.
“Children find this school a happy place
in which to be and to grow. Parents en-
joy working in it and studying the prob-
lems of growing children.”

These characteristics of the modern
elementary

school are pointed up

The photo-
graphs of modern schools in action
show children and teachers doing things
together and adults making use of the
school facilities. The significance of
play-centered activities in the elemen-
tary school program is given in the com-

throughout the volume.

M

ments accompanying many of the pic-
tures. For example:

To a cynic, a rhythm band is noise.
To children, it is an early stage in the
steady progression to skill in music, ap-
preciation of great symphonies, and en-
richment of living.

When the music plays, feet start to
fiy.

Playing house in the home corner in-
volves a real breakfast.

Children love to use water. A well-
equipped classroom must have ready
access to water. Here, with the aid of
a good teacher, from play may develop
interest and study of canals, tug boats,
and so forth.

Tools and wood combine in inexpert
hands to become a major enterprise.

The school goes outdoors frequcntly.
The science of gardening and the con-
cept of growth are learned in the field.

Hamsters are standard equipmcnt in
classrooms.

When it’s time to go home, childrcn
have had a full and happy day.

‘I' 'K' ‘I' *-

The section entitled “Classrooms” de«
scribes typical activities in modern edu-
cation including, among others, grow-
ing plants, cooking, playing house, us-
ing records, art, hobbies, music, danc-
ing, sewing, making models, caring for
animals and fish, collecting, and pup-
petry. Re-creating community enter-
priscs and long-term projects involving
the prcceding activities are also de—
scribed. For each arca of interest the
authors prescnt a list of typical activi-
ties and facilities nccdcd for conducting
it successfully. Many of thcsc suggcs-
tions are just as useful for the play-
ground or club leader as for thc teacher.

Elsewhere are described, with appro-
priate drawings and photographs, the
essential facilities for conducting activ-
ities in the classroom. Among these
types are facilities for the library, f0]
dramatics, for arts and crafts, for mu-
sic and the handworking area, as weli
as service features. Specialized educa‘
tional spaces include the school library.
the assembly and community room, thf
playroom and the multi-purpose room
all of which could serve recreational as
well as educational uses. Specific sug-
gestions for the location, design, equip-
ment and uses of these rooms have great
value for recreation leaders. The sec
tion on “Out-of-Door Educational Are
as and Site Planning” contains a brie.
carefully selected presentation of recog
nized principles underlying the desigr
and deve10pment of outdoor play areas

In presenting the concept that tlu
school site should be developed for al
phases of the school program, the au
thors believe that no sharp line shoulr
be _drawn between educational and play
activities. They also recognize that tilt
school plant should be designed f0]
community use. “Many schools an
opening their grounds for recreationa
and play purposes. Supervised recrea
tion after school hours, in the evening
and during school vacations will stead
ily increase. The strength of such pro
grams, where organized, suggests tha
the trend toward year-round and twelve
hour to fourteen-hour-a-day use is ad
vanced and will become reasonably
widespread.”

The problem of use of school proper
ties by municipal agencies for commu
nity recreation programs is also dis
cussed and the advantages of such net

'are pointed out. The authors recogniz:

the administrative problems presenter
by joint operation, but conclude that
“Where there is a will toward coopera
tion on the part of both school and rot:
reational agency, the plan works. When
the facilities have been planned to re
duce the confiicts that might arise. a
major step to achieve cooperative ac
tion has been taken.”

To facilitatc cooperative use witl
municipal agencies the authors offer tlu
following suggestions: “Planning lo
joint use will include proper and sep
rate storage for equipmcnt and supplie.
common planning to meet prograt

)ened, and selection of equipment and
1ishes to withstand the exceptional
nount of wear. The other administra-
ve problems can be handled with more
lance of success if the building and
°ounds have heen planned well for
lint use.”

In the section, “Community Use of
311001 Buildings,” it is stated that there
no section of the country in which the
pnmunity-school idea could not be ad-
mced. “The school belongs to the peo-
F. It cannot be an institution isolated
om the community and utilized only
pr the daily sessions of elementary boys
1d girls, but should be available for
jder use during the school week and
>r extensive use during the vacation
sriods. Every school should open its
ors after the clementary school day
s ended and keep them open to serve

or community needs that find ex-
sion.”

importance of cooperative planning of
areas and facilities intended for recrea-
tion use by both school and community
groups. The authors state, “Frequently,
the greatest advantages can be secured
if school sites are selected adjacent to
sites intended for park or recreation
purposes. The planning of the play-
ground and out-of-door activities can
then be done jointly, and the arrange-
ment for use and administration of the
facilities can be worked out between the
agencies concerned.

“School playgrounds assigncd dur-
ing the school day to the regulariiaed
educational program ought to be avail-
ahle for use after school hours, on week-
ends, and during vacation periods, for
general community use. The play-
grounds of the recreation commission
or the park department should likewise
be open to school use during the day-
time and continue to serve its additional
clientele on other occasions.

“Joint planning and joint use of play-
grounds (as well as such other facili-
ties as toilet and dressing rooms, ins-
tructors’ quarters and indoor play are-
as) will contrihute much to community
satisfactions and certainly reduce capi-
tal outlay costs in the long-range plan.”

ity rooms and construction materials.
Much of this information is as applic-
able to recreation buildings as to
schools and is particularly useful in re-
lation to recreation rooms used by chil-
dren of elementary school age. The sec-
tion, “Surveys and Site Selection,” de-
scribes procedures for conducting a

cause of its fund of information of di-

Stanton H. King

 

"E THOUGHT a sailor’s life was the only
life worth living.

One of twenty-nine children, Stan-
ton King was born in about 1868, in
the Barbados. When twelve years old
he left home and went to sea. His
mother asked the captain to make the
voyage as disagreeable as possible,
hoping that the boy would have enough
of a sailor’s life. Stanton slept on the
spare mainsail and underwent the mis-
ery of seasickness. In a wind squall he
had to climb to the topmast rigging.
He made three trips from Bermuda to
New York as a cabin boy. He washed
dishes, was taken on as a cook’s helper,
and was not fourteen when he was
made cook. As a stowaway he tramped
the New York streets like a homeless
dog. He knew what it meant to be
court-martialed to the “brig” for thirty
days on bread and water and the loss
of a month’s pay. But instead of be-
coming sick of the sea he learned to
master it.

One Sunday afternoon aboard, then

 

“CAP’N BILL,” author of OUTDOOR

“bo’s’n’s mate,” he heard the hymns
of his youth, and thereupon decided to
be what his mother would have him be.
This story is told in Dog-Watches at
Sea. The author is Stanton H. King.
When I first met Mr. King he was
of Sailors”
Charlestown, Massachusetts. Each sum-

superintendent Haven,
mer he would literally pick up twenty-
five waifs from the streets of Charles-
town and spend eight full days with
them in a sail loft in Provincetown, on
the tip of Cape Cod. This one room
was dormitory, galley, and game room.
They hung hammocks at night. In
King’s own language, they had to [lat-
ten down the sheets and keep her close
hauled. Each summer, when the wind
was a bit abaft the beam, Stanton King
and Dan Harvey would bring the whole
crew to spend the day at Camp Che-
quesset, a nautical camp for girls. This
was one of the big events of the sum-
mer.

The girl campers were from the other
end of the financial scale. First, they
guided the boys about the camp and to
their cabins in the pitch pines. “Gee,
everybody has a bed to himself,” was
the usual remark. Fruit was brought
out, and to the delight of the girls, the
boys stored it in their blouses. That
was what they always had done when
they grabbed fruit from a push cart.

William G. Vinal

There was a baseball game; then cam
the big cookout on the beach.

Perhaps the event that lingers long
est in memory was the singing of se
chanteys. Mr. King was Uncle Sam'
chanteyman in World War I. I ca

still hear “Down to Rio,” and “0]
King Cole.” With Mr. King’s deep voic

rolling out over the sea, the pipin
voices of the boys, the harmony of th
the
joined in—there was never a more e1
thusiastic songfest. After the sea hau
ing songs, and maybe a Harry Laudc

song by Dan Harvey, the audience SE

hear the tales of adventure and of lil
on an old sailing vessel. If I had ha
any wonderment as to how a man i
his sixties dared to take sixty-live “liar
cases” to a sail loft single-handed, 1n
doubts were put to flight. It took 3
understanding person, who had spel
part of his life in sailing ships, in th
merchant marine, and later in the “01
Navy,” to “tar down the rigging” an
bring a motley but obedient cre‘
aboard.

King could do it, and the boys w01
shipped him for what he was. If h
chance one of King’s boys should rea
this and get a quick pulsation of hi
heart, I trust that he will stand by tl]
mainmast long enough to say “pip
down” and give a long shrill whistl
for the old boatswain’s mate. He cc]
tainly would have had no “mournin
at the bar” when he put out to sea.

RECREATIO

Listening and Viewing

Community Recreation on TV

Television shows dealing with com-
unity recreation have been produced

I thc Ford Fund for Adult Education
WOI-TV in Ames, Iowa.

The first of these dealt with the rec-
ation problems of the small commu-
ty of Toledo, Iowa, and was a part of
series of programs called The Whole
Plan’s Talking. In this series, burning
cal issues and problems were dis-
Issed by citizens in an effort to find a
:.mocratic solution. The value of full,
Fe discussion of all sides of a question
as pointed up. The underlying issue
Toledo was whether an organized or
Iorganized approach should be taken
recreation in that town.

Another Iowa town was slated for dis-
ssion of recreation in the series. In
is case the question was apathy vs.
lion in meeting recreation needs. As
result of the preliminary town-meet-
g and subsequent activity in prep-
ation for the program, a recreation
lmcil was formed, definite steps were
em to provide a program and the
rathy was eliminated—so the TV show
is cancelled.

lFollowing this start, in the spring of
152, it was decided to produce four
Isumcntary programs on recreation
e following winter. These half-hour
ograms were carefully planned and
pared with the help of professional
reation persons and were filmed.

he first film is a definition of recrea-
m: what it is for, what it is. The sec-
[(1 shows the sc0pe of recreation—the
riety of activities for everybody. It
Eicts the way recreation serves the
plc of Iowa and emphasises what

II community of Ruthven as an ex-
le of how the people can organize,

'm for all citizens. In this film, the
Inbers of the Ruthven Recreation
Imcil are the spokesmen, and they

series of dramatic recordings, aptly
called ENRICIIMENT RECORDS, are now
ready: Explorations of Pere Marquette,
adapted from the story by Jim Kjel-
gaard; Lewis and Clarke Expedition,
adapted from the book by Richard L.
Neuberger; Monitor and the M errimac,
adapted from the book by Fletcher
Pratt; and Lee and Grant at A ppomat-
tox, adapted from the book by MacKin-
lay Kantor. The stories of these thrill-
ing events in history are dramatized

tically endorsed this series; thousands
of youngsters have given their approval
by asking for additional titles. The rec-
ords are advertised for young people,
ages nine to fourteen, but we suggest
that they can be en oyed by all who are
young-in-heart. Use them during Book
Week, November 15-21, for they will

periods in history; use them to set the
atmosphere for historical pageants of
the period; try them out with your
golden-agers; add them to your center

library. Prices are: 78 RPM (standard)

News Notes

I Fay S. Mathewson of Plainlield, New
Jersey, and Ernest M. Ford of Yonkers,
New York, have been awarded the 1953
Tarbell Medallion Award—the highest
honor bestowed upon an alumnus by
Springfield College, Springfield, Massa-
chusetts, “in recognition of meritorius
service to Alma Mater.” Mr. Ford, a
YMCA executive secretary, is currently
serving as vice-chairman of the Council
on YMCA-Springfield College Relation-
ships; while Mr. Mathewson, Union
County, New Jersey, recreation di-
rector, who has been president of the
American Recreation Society, is class
alumni fund representative.

0 Co-ordinator of the recreation cur-
riculum at the University of Wisconsin,
H. C. Hutchins, says: “The recreation
curriculum of the University of Wiscon-
sin is graduating thirty seniors in 1953:
live in February, twenty in June and
live in August. Of this number the
armed forces have claimed five, mar-
riage has taken seven others out of cir-
culation, and three have chosen non-rec-
reation occupations, leaving half the
current crap of graduates in or about
to enter the profession.”

0 George K. Makechnie, dean of Bos-
ton University’s Sargent College of
Physical Education, recently delivered
an address at Oxford University on the
subject of school camping. Mr. Makech-
nie directs a year-round program of
school camping for the school children
of greater Boston. The occasion of his
talk was the first of three major physi-
cal education conferences which were
held in Europe this summer.

0 Jackson J. Perry, executive director
of the Leominster (Massachusetts) rec-
reation center, has been named assis-
tant professor of recreation at the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts for this year.

One of the newer developments
recreation is the program conducted
hospitals to care for the recreation nee

TIPS FROM OUR READERS
' Zelball

We introduced the game of Zelball on
our playgrounds in Danville, Virginia.
It quickly became the most popular
game. We sponsored tournaments on
each playground and had more partici-
pants than in any other single tourna-
ment. We bought equipment from the
Zelball Company, Mount Holly, New
Jersey, for 'one playground. Then we
made our own equipment for the other
playgrounds except for the Zelballs and
cords, which we purchased from the
company. The equipment we made con-
sisted of two pieces of pipe, one fitting
down into the other, and the paddles,
which were cut out of a solid piece of
wood. This game is a winner for all
age groups—ANNE HAMILTON, Super-
visor o/ Playgrounds, Recreation De-

Publications

Covering the Leisure-lime Field

Recreation authorities will read with
special interest the section dealing with
park and recreation developmcnts in
1952, prepared by George D. Butler of
the National Recreation Association,
and a comparable chapter on city plan-
ning developments. The table reporting
payrolls for selected city jobs, including
park executive and recreation director,
affords data that will interest recreation
authorities, but will cause little elation.
The directories of city officials contain
valuable reference sources, and the bib-
liographies throughout the chapters
summarize new and standard literature
on various municipal subjects.

Philosophy of

Recreation and Leisure

J. B. Nash. C. V. Mosby Company,
St. Louis 3. Pp. 222. $3.50. ‘

Here is an up to the minute analysis
of leisure and recreation as they relate
to today’s increased away-from-the-job
living. Vivid and meaningful word-il-
lustrations throughout the book, tied
with a philosophical approach, make
it very readable and provide the reader
with sound basic concepts of the why,
what and how of the constructive use of
our leisure hours.

The process of planning for this book
has taken twenty years and Dr. Nash
discusses in his introduction a study he
has made of one thousand adults. His
purpose was to determine at what age
people learn the skills which, as adults,
they use in recreation. He discovered‘
that the skills acquired by 60 per cent
were learned before the age of ten, 70
per cent before the age of twelve and
over 85 per cent before the age of
twenty. These significant findings indi-
catc that youth is the best time in which
to learn skills. However, the author
hastens to point out that this does not in-
dicate that individuals over twenty-one
cannot do so.

Other chapters of particular interest

and which add special importance to
this book include: “The Activity Drive,

Play-Work-Leisure”; “Man the Specta-

tor”; “Man the Creator”; “Abuse of .

Creative and Mental Growth

(Revised Edition)

Viktor Lowenfeld. The Macmillan
Company, New York 11. Pp. 408. $5.00.

This book is not for those leaders who
want to be “spoon-fed” with easy how-
to-do-its. For those departments and
leaders who realize the importance of
art in the physical, mental and emo-
tional development of children, how-
ever, and who want to understand bet-
ter how to develop and interpret it, this
book is a must. It is serious and thor-
ough, and requires careful reading and
thbught. The reader will be richly re-
warded by the new insight methods, and
values he will gain.

Those working with the handicapped
———physical or mental—will find Chapter
VIII particularly helpful.

Recreation leaders, whether respon-
sible for arts and crafts programs or
not, should read Chapter I'in order to
get a better understanding of what art
work means to a child, and its import-
ance to healthy personality develop-
ment. This chapter would be a fine sub-
j ect for staff discussion—Virginia M us-
selman, Program Service, National Rec-
reation Association.

For those recreation leaders who have
been writing to us, in increasing num-
bers, for information as to how to start
a baseball-clinic, we call attention to
this new pamphlet on the subject which
came out early in the summer. Pub-
lished as a handbook for both mana-
gers and players, it covers organiza-
tion of classes, lessons to he used in
training and building up your club, and
includes sections on batting, base-run-
ning, pitching, catching, infielding, out-
fielding, and maxims of basehall.

If you’ve been thinking about start-
ing a production group, or if you havc
a group and feel that it needs a few
kinks rolled out of it, you would do well
to tuck a copy of Teen Theater under
your arm for quick reference.

The book not only covers every as-
pect of a production, such as organiza-
tion, directing, acting, scenery, props,
costumes, make-up, lighting, special ef-
fects, publicity, programs and house
management, hut also includes six non-
royalty one-act plays. These plays, all
comedies in present day settings, are
particularly suitable for the teen-age
group, but don’t let that scare other
groups away from Teen Theater. If you
are a leader in the long established
“drama society” of your town, or in an
adult club that wants to put on a play, or
in a church, a grange, or the community
recreation center—just pick your play
and use Edwin and Nathalie Gross’s
Teen Theater production plans! .Easy

Here it is! At last! A book on mak-
ing mobiles, those fascinating modern
objects that swing and sway from the
ceiling'. Here’s a new craft for adults;
a new craft for children—because mo-
biles can be made of paper, tin, copper,
glass, and be simple or elaborate, de-
pending on the skill of the person.
They’re fascinating to watch—and to
make!

This book is written clearly, simply,
and illustrated by beautiful photographs
of the author’s own mobiles. Order it—
and get a group started! It’ll be the
most popular craft in your program.

500 Live Ideas for the
Gradc Tcachcr

Betty Lois Eckgren and Vivian Fishel.

Row, Peterson and Company, Evanston,

Illinois. Pp. 320. $2.00.

We heard about this book from one of
our National Recreation Association
training specialists who saw it being
used and enjoyed by several recreation
leaders, so we wrote for a review c0py.

It is a collection of simple ideas,
mostly of crafts and games suitable to
use with children of elementary school
age. Each idea is developed alphabet-
ically, so a game may be next to a craft
project—but the general index in the
back will help you find what you need
quickly. Directions are clear, and many
of the suggestions are illustrated.

We suggest that you add it to your

recreation library. You’ll find I
your playground and indoor CB]
leaders will make good use of it,
cause the projects are non-techni
and would be fun for youngsters.

The MACHINE GUN belonged to E Company,
Sccond Battalion, Seventh Marines. It was
undcr the command of Technical Sergeant
Robert Sidney Kennemore.

It was busy. For on this November night
fanatical Red masses were swamping Marine
defense positions north of Yudam-ni.

Fifteen yards in front of the gun, a Red sol-
dier. raised his body briefly and sent a grenade
