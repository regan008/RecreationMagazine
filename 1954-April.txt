JUVENILE DELINQUENCY

WHY SHOULD we teach children to
play? Can play be supervised?
Last January in Washington these ques-
tions were seriously debated in Con-
gress and an appropriation for play-
grounds was defeated on the ground
that supervised play was unnatural, that
you could not teach children to play. I
was told that one of the distinguished
gentlemen said, “You might as well try
to teach fishes to swim as children to
play.”

He was right—so far as he under-
stood what he was talking about. I have
much sympathy with those who note how
far in our attempt to educate the child
we have taken from him his initiative,
who object to further encroachment
upon the sacred domain of childhood.
But the records of that debate show an
entire lack of comprehension and much
ignorance of the whole question. Of all
things, the advocate of supervised play
is trying to restore initiative to the
child. That is just the reason why he
advocates supervision. Would the gen-
tleman advocate that a mother should
not supervisc the appetites of her chil-
(lren, or their hours of sleep? Play has
always been supervised, has always
been taught. A bird is taught its song
by those of its kind. A school boy reared
a young robin and taught it to whistle.
It never once gave the call of a robin.

A kingfisher teaches its young to fish,
a cat plays with her kittens. Hands off
the play instinct? Did the child or the
mother originate “This little pig went
to market” and the scores of mother
plays that have been common to all
races and all times?

Did a boy ever play baseball who was
not taught by some one? A boy no
more inherits_the game of baseball than
he inherits the Lord’s Prayer. What a
boy does inherit is an instinct for throw-
ing just as a bird inherits the instinct
for singing but not the song. When this
instinct is not supervised, what hap-
pens? Some Pittsburgh boys were ar-

j EDITORIAL |

A voice from the past makes us wonder; have chil-
dren changed so much? The following remarks, as
pertinent today as ever, are exeerpeted from “Why
Teach a Child to Play,” by George E. Johnson, Pro-
ceedings Third Annual Playground Congress, 1909.

rested and brought to the juvenile
court. They had thrown stones at mov-
ing passenger cars in the ravine below
them. In common with other boys they
had the instinct for throwing, but it was
not supervised.

Little Tim appeared in our juvenile
court for stealing apples. He was warn-
ed, and let go, but returned again and
again. In despair the probation officer
said, “Now, Tim, tell me honest, why do
you steal these apples? Do you get so
hungry for them that you just can’t help
it?” The boy looked a little surprised,
hung his head a moment and then said,
“Why, I don’t care much about eating
’em, but it is such fun to have old
Smudge chase me.” Chase him! And
why not? Thousands of generations of
boys before him have been chasing
some real or fancied good or fleeing
There was
another boy whose instinct for the chase
was supervised. Tag, hill dill, prisoner’s
base, and finally football were taught
him, and one day in a stadium with

some real or fancied evil.

twenty-five thousand people rising in
enthusiasm to their feet he carried the
ball for a gain of fifty yards down a
protected field. The love of chase born
in Tim was the same as in the other,
but the one was supervised and the
other not.

No case ever appeared in the Pitts-
burgh juvenile court or any other juve-
nile court in which the act committed
was not prompted wholly or in part by
some impulse which under other rela-
tions and other associations could not
be both right and desirable.

The police and criminal courts are
full of cases of misdirected rivalry and
competition, the right expression of

which has meant so much to the world.
Boy gangs stoning and knifing each
other is unsupervised rivalry play, or-.
ganized games the supervised. There is
hardly anything finer in the social rela-
tions of men than the spirit of true
sportsmanship that despises an unmerit-
ed advantage and that is master of vic-
tory and of defeat. Chivalry developed
with the tournament and the joust.

Is it not true
teaches, that a part of teaching a fish to
swim is to give it an opportunity to

that environment

swim? A part of teaching a child to play
is giving him an Opportunity to play.
From down deep in the child come the
age-old, unceasing calls for him to be
something, to do something. No great
mind, no great character, ever blessed
the race who did not lay the foundations
of his individuality, his might and his
worth in answering to those deep calls
of his nature.

Why teach a child to play? One might
as well ask why teach a child at all.
Play was the mother of education.
Species and races have advanced pro-
portionately as they have played. Nay!
as they have taught play. With what per-
fectly adapted and entrancing steps
does play still lead the young child unto
knowledge and efficiEncyl And when
finally he is taken into the school, his
education is effective proportionately as
it gathers inspiration and force from
the great stream of humanity, which
vastly more than the individual himself
determines the issues of each individual
life. To try to educate children other-
wise is to fly in the face of the immuta-

ble purpose of God himself, which he

has revealed to us in the story of evo-
lution.

} DEADLINE FOR STORIES, articles and
other items of interest for the special
school-recreation issue of RECREATION
magazine is May 14. We would like to
have: specific examples of community-
school cooperation in program activi-
ties, leadership planning, use of facili-
ties. We would appreciate receiving pet
ideas for noon-hour or recess activities;
stories of school-room parties; ideas for
proms; other teen-age programs. We
would like to hear about successful ex-
periments in using recreation to reduce
vandalism; instances of school recrea-
tion in charge of a recreation-trained,
professional leader, and of any good
school-recreation programs under such
leadership. We would like to hear from
some experienced person on the cooper-
ation of school and community in pre-
senting creative and cultural recreation
activities, and on the close relationship
of recreation and adult education and
the implications of this to the recrea-
tion leader.

} THE MERITS OF LAMINATED BATS are
being tested by a three-man committee
named by the professional baseball
leagues, according to the New York
Times of February 12. For years the
professional teams have relied on the
solid-wood bats. The rules committee
recently adopted an amendment to ap-
prove the experimental use of laminated
bats in 1954, but each bat used must
have prior approval of the committee.
If the bats prove to have greater dura-
bility, baseball costs can be reduced,
especially for “schools, amateur clubs
and sand-lotters.”

} BIC-TIME ATHLETIC SPORTS were at-
tacked by the Educational Policies Com-
mission at the eightieth annual conven-
tion of the American Association of
School Administrators, in February.
According to their report, based on a
three-year study, school athletic pro-
grams should be “planned to benefit all
the papils and not a few star athletes or
a sports-interested community.” It con-
demned all games that turn schoolboy

198

games into public spectacles and teen-

'age players into privileged persons.

The commission further proposed
that the costs of school’s athletic pro-
gram should come from general funds
and not from gate receipts. These and
many others of their recommendations,
if carried out, would drastically change
the nature of school sports in this nation.

} A DIVERSIFICATION OF TRAINING OF-
PORTUNITIES for teachers, and other
professional workers with exceptional
children, characterizes the 1954 Sum-
mer Session Program in Special Educa-
tion offered by Teachers College, Co-
lumbia University. Professional pre-
paration leading to advanced degrees
and diplomas will be offered in the fol-
lowing areas: The Mentally Retarded,
the Physically Handicapped, the Deaf
and Hard of Hearing, and Audiology.
In addition, a number of general
courses in the field will be open to spe-
cialists and non-specialists. Provision
is made for mature students desiring
professional preparation without ma-
triculation for graduate degrees or
diplomas.

) THE RESUME OF THE TEEN-ACE STUDY
conducted in Schenectady, published in
the January issue of RECREATION under
the title “Recreational Interests and
Needs of High School Youth,” proved
to be of interest to the press at large. In
so far as we know it has been comment-
ed upon by the New York Times, the
Peoria, Illinois Star, and the Pittsburgh
Press.

Juvenile Delinquency

Sirs:

Just read Mr. Prendergast’s very ex-
cellent editorial on “Juvenile Delin-
quency” in the February RECREATION.

Without in anyway condoning the
fact or sidestepping the issue with its
very close relationship to our work (rec-
reation) , more emphasis, as he has sug-
gested, should be placed upon the
ninety-seven per cent of happy children
who escape delinquency and live a nor-
mal life.

It is unfortunate that in many of our
news items the abnormal instead of the
normal is emphasized. There is no
question but that the undue emphasis on
delinquency is having an evil effect on
certain types of our youth.

The challenge to our recreation move-
ment is contained in the paragraph,
“Recreation Operates in a positive way
in its relation to delinquency by build-
ing in the boy or girl interests, skills
and resources which crowd out the call
of the gang. . .”

We were awaiting, Mr. Prendergast,
your accepting of this challenge for our
movement. May each of us in your ever
increasing family be conscious of our
individual responsibility in this chal-
lenge you have issued.

GRANT D. BRANDON, Director of Rec-
reation, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

“A Challenge to Recreation”

Sirs:
A Chameleon Answers An Iconoclast

Mr. Morris in his letter “A Challenge
to Recreation” reminds me so much of
a boy playing his first football game,
scoring a touchdown on his very first
play, and then a bit bewildered because
he hasn’t been able to score again. He
can’t understand what’s happened. As
a result he blames everyone in sight but
himself. He doesn’t realize that football
is a team activity where everyone is
responsible for the game.

So it is with Mr. Morris.
to the growth of recreation as an as-
tounding eXpansion during the first half
of the twentieth century, but credits this
to grass roots growth. The team" made
up of such groups as our leading na-
tional organization, national profes-
sional society, the colleges and the state
societies who strived for years to get
recognition for recreation had nothing

200

He admits I

to do with the growth according to Mr.
Morris. Just like the boy playing that
first game, scoring his touch-down and
thinking that he did it all by his lone-
some.

Mr. Morris blames what he appraises
a failure on naive leaders, the colleges,
athletic directors, industry, sports-writ-
ers, newspapers, state societies, and our
national organizations.

If this so-called failure does exist why
then does he exclude the recreation
workers, the rank and file, from any and
all blame? Is it because Mr. Morris hap-
pens to be one of the workers and
doesn’t care to share the blame?

A profession is what the rank and file
want it to be. The leaders of today will
remain as long as the rank and file wish
for them to continue. The responsibility
for the failure, if it does exist, therefore

rightfully is that of the workers in the
field.

Labor today meets management on
an even keel only because the rank and
file have banded together and chosen
their leaders to work as a team and fight
as a team.

It has been my contention for many
years that recreation is “a house di-
vided”—community recreation, parks,
industrial, hospital, school and private
recreation workers all going their sep-
arate ways. The sooner we get together
and work together the better for us all.

As I look at recreation today I see
growth in every direction. It’s true that
our condition is not a perfect one; but
a growing profession always has grow-
ing pains.

Great strides are being made every
day, leading to the growth of our pro-
fession. Our colleges are on the move;
industry is now spending millions of
dollars in recreation; the National Rec-
reation Association under the inspiring
leadership of Joseph Prendergast is ren-
dering a great service; state-level recog-
nition has been achieved in many
states; the New York State Youth Com-
mission serving more than 850 com-
munities has added a tremendous im-
petus to the movement; and recreation
is growing on the local level at a rapid
pace———these are but a few illustrations.

I have taken the liberty of answering
Mr. Morris at his own request. “A Chal-
lenge to Recreation” made for interest-
ing reading; however, I am not in ac-

cord with the major part of its content.
Using the technique of criticism in
order to stimulate action is pardonable;
but airing one’s gripes at the expense of
others is inexcusable. Let us disagree,
however, without becoming disagree-

able.

SAL J. PREZIOSO, President, New
York State Recreation Society.

*- 1|- 1|- *

Sirs:

As regards Mr. Morris’ letter entitled
“A Challenge to Recreation,” I intend
to take up the challenge, for I do not
think conditions are as black as he
paints them. It is not my purpose to
whitewash. recreation, as I am willing
to concede him fifty per cent credit in

his thinking, but some of his statements
are half-truths.

I would agree on the need for inspir-
ing leadership, but that is true always
and with all the professions. The na-
tion needs leadership, the church needs
leadership, we all do; but I am not dis-
couraged with our prospects. The next
decade should see a great developmentI
of leadership. I

The institutions of higher learning
of our 'nation have made great strides
since the war in providing opportunities '
for leadership training. True, there is
much“ to be desired, but compare the
academic leadership found in our col-
leges and universities today with 1940.
Even granting that many universitiesl
and colleges do not have adequate cur-
riculums, still let us give them the credit
they deserve for recognizing our profes-
slon.

How can Mr. Morris say that we are
“missing the best in the matter of school
camping. . .” If this is true, then we are
“missing the boat” in the school music
and drama programs. We are in no
position to give every sixth-grade child
a camping eXperience which is inte-
grated with a classroom teaching unit
as is done in our city. But school camp-
ing is not recreational camping. I do
believe that all organized recreation ac-
tivities for children offer many educa-
tional opportunities to the alert leader.
When this is not so, the activity should I
be eliminated.

If I were one of our leaders, I would
prefer to be “studious, intelligent, far-
sighted, idealistic, and conscientious”
rather than to be considered a high-
pressure salesman. The high-pressure
tactics would not go in my community,
and I do not think it is the best ap-
proach. We must be realistic as to the
place of recreation in the community.
For example, my city is about 165,000
in p0pulation and is spending about
$2.25 per capita for recreation. We

RECREATION

have a good, varied program and cover-
age of services. Last year the visita-
tions at our parks, playgrounds, golf
courses and pools were over 3,500,000.
If some great gigantic hand jerked all
of the facilities and scrvices out of the
city, there would be a great void. But
some people still do not consider our
scrvices a must, for ours are intangible
results. Something tangible that shock-
ed our citizens last year was a strike
among our sanitation department per-
sonnel. Everybody was immediately
concerned about the pick-up of trash
and garbage. I like the eXpression made
by Dr. W. C. Menninger when he said
that “public recreation is to mental
health what sanitation is to public
health.” But I’m not so naive as to
think that this is considered so by the
majority of our citizens, especially the
engineers.

I believe in the National Recreation
Association and in the American Rec-
reation Society. As a small cog in the
big machinery of the profession, I want
to mesh with the next cog to make the
bigger wheels turn. Man’s interest in
his fellow man inspired our recreation
movement. I believe we still havc a lot
of inspiration and will get the job done!

BEVERLY S. SHEFFIELD, Director of
Recreation, Austin, Texas.

4! I' it *

ear Mr. Morris:

Your letter which appeared in the
Ilarch issue of RECREATION was good
or all recreation workers to read. Criti-
ism is an eye-opener and makes us cor-
- ect situations which seemingly are bad
11 public life. However, Mr. Morris,
eep in mind that the recreation move-
ment is still in its infancy compared to
ducation, law, medicine and other pro-
Iessions. I wish that I had the time and
pace to debate, through these pages,
ch critical analysis you made of the
ecreation leadership in the nation.
ullice to say that I shall attempt to
nswer a few of your hypercritical
atements.

I have been in the recreation move-

- nt for thirty-one years and have seen
c tremendous growth in the training

f recreation workers. Surely the physi-
1 education people gave us birth and

- de it possible for the training of rec-

I eation majors. Before me is A Com-
\ ilation of Undergraduate Recreation
' ' urriculums in Forty-eight Institutions
uf Higher Learning, published Febru-
ry 1953, by the American Association

l or Health, Physical Education and Rec-
eation. When I investigate the cur-
'culums of such noted educational in-
itutions as the University of Indiana,

e State University of New York, North
PRIL 1954

Carolina State College, San Francisco
State College and others, I begin to see
trends that recreation is identified and
separate from health and physical edu-
cation. Just give the recreation profes-
sion time. There are signs on the hori-
zon that separate departments of recre-
ation in colleges and universities are
around the corner. Incidentally, I do
not agree with you that physical educa-
tion is only a part of recreation. Physi-
cal education is a method of teaching.
Recreation is a way of life.

In the many years that I have been in
recreation work, it has been my plea-
sure to observe the many unsolicited
editorials, in my local newspapers, en-
dorsing recreation. I can well imagine
that every recreation superintendent in
America could corroborate my state-
ment in that the same thing has hap-
pened in his city. If a newspaper editor
is given the facts, figures of mass par-
ticipation, objectives of the department,
he will write an editorial of praise. You
cannot make a statement “we have not
sold the editors on recreation and they
in turn haVe not sold public recreation.”
That is too general a statement.

I don’t know where you were at the
National Recreation Congress when you
say “scant coverage was given by the
Philadelphia papers.” I saved many
news clippings from these papers, in-
cluding photographs, and showed them
to my board upon my return home.
Philadelphia is a convention city. The
National Recreation Association’s Con-
gress was just one more convention.
Conventions are not treated as political
news, earthquakes and murders which
make the front pages of a newspaper.
Please don’t be so pessimistic but try to
learn something about the position of a
city editor of a large metrOpolitan daily.

Your depreciative remarks about the
Philadelphia Congress is just the op-
posite of what I heard many delegates
say. I talked with many recreation pco-
ple in Philadelphia and I did not hear
one derogatory remark. 0n the con-
trary, my board members, recreation
personnel from all parts of the country
said to me “Isn’t this a grand Congress.”
With all my experience, I learned much,
contributed some, and came away re-
freshed and determined to do a better
j ob.

Yes, the diliiculties of getting around
in a large hotel were somewhat bother-
some, but the National Recreation As-
sociation is limited in the amount of
money it can spend for better hotel con-
ditions. I question your statement that
a Congress should inform us of national
trends, although, after attending section

meetings, one could gather trends. I 1"”

place to resolve national policies and
take definite stands on matters of na-
.tional import. I question your state-
ment that the Congress, which lasts a
few days, is the place to decide national
policies for the recreation movement.
The real purpose of the Congress is to
exchange ideas, to learn from the other
fellow, to contribute from your experi-
ences, to listen to addresses which stim-
ulate you for better work back home.
One cannot divorce recreation from
good politics. The recreation movement
is a public recreation movement. When
the Mayor of Philadelphia addressed us
at the Congress, I was thrilled to know
of the progress that city was making in
developing its program and facilities.
I was pleased when he said, “It is clear
that private charity and individual ini-
tiative cannot be counted on to do any-
thing like the job required. The great

alike, would live, if not in a recreation

this was not a soothing and noncom-
mittal speech on recreation. I will admit
that some of the main speakers were not
too cogent, but that can easily happen
when the National Recreation Associa-
tion does not have the money to pay for

Hospital Recreation

Sirs:

“Is Hospital Recreation on the
Move?” by Hedley G. Dimock, answers
this title question in the affirmative. He
then goes on to analyze the present rec-
reation program, dividing it into three
types. Of these, he tears the first two
apart, and claims the third type as the
one to advance.

The author of this well-written article
undoubtedly has had little hospital rec-
reation experience. He has made one
glaringly obvious ommission that in-
validates most of the statements. He has
omitted the physician. He says that the
“nurse and the patient form the basic
hospital group.” It is the patient and
the doctor who form this nucleus, the
nurse working under direct medical
orders from the physician.

In essence all recreation programs
must be centered around the patient.
However, in view of the hospital situa-
tion today—overcrowding, lack of com-
munity and hospital personnel interest,
lack of personnel of all types, lack of
any part of recreational facilities and
equipment—~—many other things appear
in the picture. Therefore, the program
must vitally involve itself with extran-
eousnmatters.

Mr. Dimock may want the nurse to
assume much responsibility for the pro-
gram, but can she? I don’t believe that
she has the background either educa-
tionally or experience-wise to introduce
the patient to the recreation field and
guide his activities therein. Today the
hospital is trying to take away some of
the responsibility from the nurse and
give it to other personnel. In most hos-
pitals she fails to have continuous and
prolonged contact with the patient. The
true contact is made by attendant and
practical nurse, not the graduate nurse.
1 am sure that no one would want un-
“trained personnel to handle this special-
ized’ subject. True the nurse should
know where her patient is and what be

cognizant of his importance along the
lines.

would seem that their illness and :
outcome—-—often very serious—or t
complete change it may make in thr
life’s pattern, is sufiiciently difiicult
warrant this attention. To try to ma
life seem as it is outside the hospital
ridiculous; for institutionalizing 1
moves one from any semhlance of fa
ily life.

There is even a place for the tin
consumer. Just to allow the patir
to sit and brood, with nothing to chan
his thought, has the worst possible
fect upon his recovery. Simply to gi
him a radio to listen to, a TV set
watch, changes his thinking and has
curative efiect on his morale.

With Mr. Dimock’s points on tra
ing and objectives, I agree; but I f
that he is in error when he says tha1
is an achievement for the recreati
worker to head other services, name
occupational therapy. The only pers
to head any department other than 1
one for which he is trained and expo:
enced should be the medical pers:
such as a director of rehabilitation. l
us remember that if we can head :
other department it is right for an 1
interested, inexperienced person to he
recreation personnel.

I am sure that our progress has bt
constant and rapid. Great strides ha
been made in many directions. Mt
advancement has been overlooked
misunderstood by Mr. Dimock. The
cently published Basic Concepts of H
pital Recreation1 has provided a defi
tion. Starting a Recreation Program

:athen festival of Eostur, which hon-
'ed the return of the Spring sun to the
ast. In France, Easter is called Pa-
ues, in Italy, Pasqua, and in Spain,
ascu a—from the old Hebrew name for
1e Passover which was Pesach. What-
zer the source of the name, Easter is
Ie IIIOSt nearly universal of all festi-
11s, a joyous festival of new hope and
ew life.

The date for the celebration of this
oliday was a matter of some dispute in

the early Church, until it was finally
settled in 325 AD. at the Council of
Nicea; and ever since it has fallen on
the first Sunday after the full moon fol-
lowing the vernal equinox.

One of the most inspiring of the East-
er traditions—one that is rapidly be-
coming more widespread in this coun-
try—-—is the Sunrise Service. In days
long gone by, the days of the Nordic
barbarians, the ancient Syrians, the
Trojans, people gathered on hillsidcs at
dawn to worship and greet the sun, to
welcome the return of Spring. Today,
Americans by the hundreds of thou-
sands gather together on hillsides and
lake shores, at national monuments and
in city parks, on college campuses and
in village squares, to worship, in the
first rays of dawn on Easter morn, the
Son of God and His resurrection.

The Moravians in Salem, Massachuv

setts, were probably the first group to
hold a sunrise church service in Amer-

 

thL 1954

 

Bunnies, a favorite Easter symbol for Amer-
ican children, are featured in play put on by
little girls at a Chicago Park District party.

ica—in 1773—a service which through
the years has retained much of its origi-
nal simplicity and piety. Even today in
Salem Square the service starts with the
traditional salutation, “The Lord is
risen” and the response of the devout,
“He is risen indeed.”

In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the Mo-
ravian Trombone Choir marches
through the community, playing chor-
ales at main intersections during the
hours from midnight to dawn, to sum-
mon the faithful to services.

The sunrise service at Holy City in
the Wichita Mountains near Lawton,
Oklahoma, is based on the traditional
Passion Play. This, the “Oklahoma
Oberammergau,” is a six-hour pageant
which begins at midnight and is enacted
by thousands of local community peo-
ple on a huge natural stage surrounded
by hills—where more than a hundred
thousand Spectators sit to watch the
stirring episodes from the life of Christ.

In Alvarado Canyon, near San Diego,
five hundred Aztex Indians and their
pastor, all mounted on horses, take part
in a ceremony heralded by a trumpeter
at sunrise.

One of the strangest of Easter observ-
ances is that of the Yaqui Indians at
Pascua, a suberb of Tucson, Arizona.
During Holy Week, they present a col-
orful and spirited dramatization, in
daily episodes, of the events in the final
week of Christ’s stay on earth—inter-
woven with the ancient tribal religion.
As part of the week’s ceremonies, there
are symbolic relay races, mass fiagella-
tion, the burning of Judas in effigy (an

203

explosive Judas laden with firecrack-
ers). Great emphasis is placed upon the
struggle between Good and Evil, with
Good emerging triumphant on Easter
Sunday.

One of the most publicized services
is that held in the Hollywood Bowl in
California where trumpet calls, played
just as the sun comes over the moun-
tains, herald the start of an hour-long
program of religious music, sermons,
and prayers. The Garden of the Gods at
Colorado Springs, the Central Park
Mall and Radio City Music Hall in New
York City, the Steel Pier in Atlantic
City, the Orange Bowl in Miami, the
Soldiers’ and Sailors” Monument in In-
dianapolis, and Grand Canyon and Hot
Springs National Parks are the sites of
some of the other non-sectarian sunrise
services of national renown.

Our use of eggs at Eastertime also

harks back to the ancients. Eggs were I,

considered an emblem of the universe
and a symbol of germinating life by the
Romans, the Greeks, the Persians, the
Egyptians—and later came to be ac-
cepted in Christianity as an emblem of
the Resurrection. In most countries,
eggs dyed or decorated in some fashion,
are exchanged as gifts or in other ways
used in the holiday festivities and
games. Even the colors have great sig-
nificance in some cultures. Red, the
most widely used, is believed to signify
the blood of Christ, or the blood of the
Pascal Lamb; while yellow symbolizes
the core or beginning of life in some
countries and the sun in others.

The game of egg-cracking is widely
used with many variations. In Mesopo-
tamia, as in countless other countries
children match their hard-boiled, col-
ored eggs against those of their neigh-
bors. Each child holds an egg and
strikes it against the egg of another
child—«with the holder of the stronger
egg winning that of his opponent.

ln Latvia, eggs are rolled down an
incline. Those rolling to the right go to
the first player; those rolling to the left
belong to the second player. In Ger-
many, the child whose egg rolls the
greatest distance is the winner.

In northwestern Germany, contests
are held to see who can devour the most
eggs; and another contest tests the skill
and speed of the boys in gathering into
a basket the eggs placed at intervals

204

along a line. In the Netherlands a vari-
ation of this contest has been played
since the sixteenth century. In this ver-
sion, usually played in the village main
street, a large apple is floated in a tub of
water and several eggs are set, some dis-
tance apart, along the road. One con-
testant is given a basket into which he
places the eggs he picks up as he races
along the road. The other contestant,
who has his hands tied behind his back,
tries to eat the floating apple before his
Opponent picks up all the eggs: In Eng-
land, the boys use the eggs for bowling
as well as for playing catch and other
games.

In the United States, communities
large and small have egg decorating
contests, egg rolling, and other egg
games as part of their Easter programs.
Since 1947, youngsters between the ages
of five and thirteen have competed in
rolling wooden eggs with wooden
spoons across the lawn in Mathattan’s
Central Park. An egg-rolling party of
national fame is the one held on Easter
Monday in the nation’s capital in
which thousands of youngsters partici-
pate as guests of the First Lady, There
are no rules or prizes for this event—-

children just bring their own hard-
boiled eggs and roll them as they please
on the vast White House lawn.

 

Egg hunting is popular Easter activity
in many countries. Tiny tot finds egg at

“Giant Egg Hunt,” 'Salt Lake City, Utah.

Another survival from ancient pagan .

ceremonies, signifying the victory of
spring over winter, is the lighting of
bonfires—a custom still prevalent in
various parts of Europe today. The peo-

ple dance about the fires and carr]
home bits of the charred embers whicl
are supposed to protect their home
from disaster. It was in about 1846 tha
the German settlers in Fredericksburg
Texas, began lighting fires on Easte
Eve atop the nearby hills. In recen
years the ringing of church bells, th
hanging of fireworks and the presentin;
of pageants have added color and gaiet'
to the occasion.

It was in Egypt that the hare—a sym
bol of fertility—first became a part 0
the Easter, or beginning of the nex
year, traditions. However, it is from
the Germans that the idea of the Easte
rabbit bringing eggs has come to us.
As in America, the rabbit, in German
also hides brightly colored eggs for chil
dren to hunt on Easter morning.

The hot cross buns which appear 01
Christian tables during the Easter sea
son stem from the ancient pagan sacra
mental cakes which the Anglo-Saxon
ate in honor of their goddess, Eostrc
Early Christian clergy, unable to roc
out the use of these cakes, blessed the:
and decorated them with a cross to giv
them Christian significance.

It is customary in most countries fo
everyone to wear something new 01
Easter Sunday. In England the weal
ing of a new garment on this day is sail
to insure good, luck for the rest of th
year. The fabulous parade of fashion
along Fifth Avenue has drawn hug
swarms of people to New York City an
nually ever since the late nineteenth cen
tury. And on the boardwalks of Net
Jersey there are numefous parades an:
contests.

One of the most novel events of thi
type, however, is the Easter Fashiol
Parade on Skies held yearly since 194.
on Mammoth Mountain near Bishop
California. All contestants must wea
costumes, and there is a seemingly end
less variety of everything from hoboe
to ballet dancers.

In all Christian countries, people giv
themselves up to visiting, partying, ant
feasting after the severity and solem
ness of Lent. Eggs, of course, are th
most commonly served food on th
menu; but lamb or ham, and swee
cakes also make their appearance ofte:
on the various festal tables. It is cus
tomary too, in many places, to have th
food blessed before it is eaten.

RECREATIOI

From talk delivered at the 34th National Recreation Congress in Philadelphia

 

I WANT TO CONSIDER with you some of the problems which

I think you must help face, which have been raised by
our very progress. The first one is this: Our modern ma-
chine age has made life easier physically and harder men-
tally. I think I need not develop that first point. Our‘hours
of work are shorter; our houses are more comfortable. We
have all kinds of modern conveniences. We want and we get
things pretty easily. I heard of a camp in Maine, advertising
for New York and Boston guests, which put out a little
brochure with this caption, “Roughing it Smoothly.” What-
ever that is, that is what we want. We want everything made
as comfortable as can be.

But did you ever stop to think that along with this mech-
anization there is a great deal of really burdensome routine
left? I sometimes wonder if there may not be almost more
petty routine in modern life than in the olden times. An
Oxford writer wrote a few years ago, “Onc of the tragedies
of modern times is that so many able people are doomed to
do little things.” He said, “Think of the Middle Ages.”
The Middle Ages, of course, were a smaller world. Those
people didn’t know about this new world. They thought the
earth was flat. “But when you look at their cathedrals, see
that incomparable beauty, realize how they brought order
out of chaos and developed tribes into nations, thcn,” he
said, “the people of the Middle Ages seem like tiny people
doing colossal things.”

We have enlarged the minds of men, we have given them
tastes for ncw things, we have shown them the world-—-we
can bring the world to them every day—and yet here they

ticles, is the minister of Christ Church in “New York City.

APRIL 1954;

_. CREATIVE CURES

FOR THE ILLS

OF MODERN LIFE

The Rev. Dr. Ralph W. Sockman

have to stand in a production line hammering a rivet, doing
those things that we call drudgery. Sometimes when we get
a bit critical of the acquisitive aspects of certain factory
workers, we might remember that there is a great deal of
routine drudgery left in the world and that they don’t get
surcease from that merely by sitting watching the television
or going to the movies. In those things, they only see more
things to want, so often only sharpen their acquisitive in-
stincts. Somebody has got to give them the outlet for their
creative impulses. Otherwise we shall destroy ourselves by
our acquisitive desires.

Then, along with that petty routine, think of the boredom
that our modern life has made. Someone has said, I think an
English writer, that boredom takes a heavier toll of life than
either cancer or heart disease. If you think of the taking of
life not only in terms of actual death but in the killing of
impulses, I suppose that is right; boredom destroys our
productive eHiciency.

How to relieve that boredom? Can we do it by giving
some purposeful activity, some hobbies ,that really are crea-
tive? You can’t do it without organization. You can’t lcave
bored people to themselves to try to find their own solution.
They can’t do it.

And then think of that other aspect of life being mentally
harder, namely the rctirement age. We have lengthened
longevity and shortened the employable years, so that after
that so-called employable deadline, years stretch out. What
do they do with that old age? That is one of the things I see
you are doing a great deal to solve; but, you know, I have a
feeling that the most pertinent aspect of education today is
adult education, something that will prepare us for retire-
ment. You can’t ust go up to the age of retirement and then

205

suddenly jump off. You have to lay your plans ahead.

I sometimes ask my busy men what they are reading. Well,
I will not tell you what they tell me lest you might think it

doesn’t take much intelligence to preach to that crowd.
They get their trade papers, the morning papers, sit down
before the television, and before they know it they fall
asleep. And they are college men, most of them. I am con-
vinced that adult education is really the most difficult and
perhaps most pertinent problem in education that we face.
The test of an educated mind isn’t what it knows when it
graduates; it is what it is doing at fifty, at sixty.

 

But I Want to say a second thing, and that is: Modern life
is making life easier physically and harder morally. What
did the old artisan or farmer want seventy-five or one hun-
dred years ago when he finished his day’s work after some
fourteen hours of hard labor? He wanted rest and quiet and
solitude. What does the modern office worker or factory
worker want when he or she has finished at five o’clock?
What do people want after they get through with eight hours’
work—rest and quiet and solitude? Not at all. They want
excitement, entertainment, thrill. They have the time for it.
They have the unspent physical energy for it.

Now, I contend that that situation makes a harder moral
problem, and it isn’t enough for the church or for the teach-
ers in the schools simply to preach to pe0ple what they
should not do. Prohibitions never really solve moral prob-
lems. We must provide for them wholesome, constructive
activities of leisure time.

I think you are doing and the country is doing a pretty
admirable and increasingly magnificent ob of providing for
the youth of our country. Just think of the improved play-
grounds, and think of what the churches are doing for the
older people. But I have a feeling, somehow—maybe I am
wrong—that the most dangerous age of life is neither youth
nor old age. It is middle age. I preached a sermon some
years ago, when I was about thirty, on “The Collapses of
Middle Age.”

When I had finished this sermon, the district superinten-
dent, a minister in charge of sixty or more churches, came
to me and said, “If you ever preach that sermon again I will
give you an ilhistration for it.” This is the illustration which
he suggested. He said, “When I was appointed district super-
intendent by the bish0p out in Ohio, I went to the bishop and
said, ‘Now, Bish0p, what can I do to keep closest to my
younger ministers? I assume, of course, that is my most
difiicult problem.’

“ ‘Oh, no,’ said Bishop McDowell, ‘your most difficult

206

problem isn’t to keep close to the young ministers. It is to
keep close to the middle-aged ministers. It is when the ideals
that looked so near at twenty-eight seem as far away at

forty-eight—it is then that men tend to let down their mental
alertness and even their moral harness.’ ”

I am inclined to think there is a kind of smugness and
complacency blended with the rush of our compctitive life
and the material things in which we are immersed that makes
middle age perhaps the most dangerous age of life. An ad-
dress by a great English urist was printed in The Atlantic
Monthly, about 1942, under the caption, “Law and Mores.”
Lord Moulton said that you could divide the area of human
conduct into three zones. Here at the left is a zone of be-
havior, that we should have no laws to regulate; man’s cons-
cience should be free between him and his God. Over here
at. the right is a zone of conduct that you can regulate by
law—how fast to drive, how much to pay your employees,
and so forth. But in between, said Lord Moulton, is a region
of conduct where you do what you should do, not because
some law compels it, and where you refrain from doing what
you should not do, not really because some policeman
whistles but where you are restrained by inner sanctions.
He called it the region of obedience to the unenforceable and
said, “Unless we preserve that region of obedience to the tin-
enforceable, what will happen is that your region of regi-
mentation will spread and spread and spread until you regi-
ment away your freedoms, even in lands like England and
America.” In middle age we must watch that middle area.

Veritably democracy is at stake in this area that is regu-
lated by those inner sanctions that obey the unenforceable,
and I am not sure whether obedience is harder in the big
town or in the little town. I have often thought that the big
city was the place where we are so lost in the crowd that
civic morale is hard to maintain; the group grows and the
individual dwarfs.

I was born on a farm in Ohio, went to a little town in Ohio
to school, and when I walked down the street of that little
town I more or less had to behave. Everybody knew me.
But I can walk the streets of New York, lost in the crowd, un-
wept, unhonored and unsung. Nobody knows who you are.
Dwight L. Moody said once, “Character is what a man is in
the dark,” and the new darkness of our day is the darkness
of numbers. What you and I face is to deve10p in people
some kind of, shall we call it good sportsmanship, moral
character, wholeness of life that will protect them from the
collapses that come when they are dwarfed by the pressure
of numbers in this modern life.

Thirdly and lastly, this modern age, modern life, has done
another thing that makes a problem, and it is this: It has
brought pe0ple closer together physically and farther apart

socially. We all know how the trend has been to the city
in America.

I think we are doing something to correct that “assembli-

zation.”

We are improving farm life. Many of you are
workers in the recreational activity of small communities.
They need recreation just as much as does the big city be-
cause there is a pettiness about small places that, if we don’t

correct it, does harm them.

RECREATION

We are getting closer together. Crowds mount, cities mul-
tiply, but here is the sinister fact: The closer we get to-
gether, the more conscious we become of our differences.
Racial tensions, industrial tensions are in the metropolitan
centers. The soldiers thought in the war if we could just
make people travel together and get people together more
easily, we would make for brotherhood and peace. Just
getting people close together doesn’t make for brotherhood.
If that were true, the New York subway would be the most
brotherly place in the world. It isn’t. Just getting closer to-
gether brings out those acerbities that break us up.

This is our task: How can we develop the social attitudes
that will match our technical skills? I maintain that atti-
tudes today are more important than skills. The technical
skills a boy may learn today may be outmoded ten or fifteen
or twenty years from now, but an attitude is good today and
tomorrow. We need attitudes to be inculcated even more
than skills to be developed, but we need our social attitudes
to be made skillful.

You can go any place today and be cheered when you talk
about race brotherhood and world peace and industrial har-
mony. We have good impulses. Everybody wants these ideal
conditions. But we are so awkward in applying them, we
lack such skill in doing them, that we still have strikes. We
have racial disturbances and we have the threat of world
war. How, then, can we get the skill in developing our social
attitudes?

My friends, in the midst of all these baffling, complex
world problems I would almost say that the most needcd
formula of our day right now is the local drill ground and
the personal guidance to bring these great ideals that we all
cheer—of world peace, of racial understanding—down to
that local community level. There is the place where we

develop the skill. The future of our free democratic society
is in the hands of the local drill grounds of character—
home, school, playground, the community.

I was born, as I have said, in Ohio, and when I was a boy
out there, perhaps the most influential preacher was Wash-
ington Gladden of Columbus, Ohio, 8 great Congregational
churchman. He was a great interpreter. He was always hold-
ing before his people those ideals I have mentioned of world
peaCe and racial understanding, but he couldn’t always see

his way clear. He once wrote these lines:

I know that right is right,

That it is not good to lie;

That love is better than spite,
And a neighbor than a spy.

In the darkest night of the year,
When the stars are all gone out,
That courage is better than fear
And faith is truer than doubt.

You see, these are attitudes and if you bring them down
to the level of the community and the playground and the
recreational hours over and above our work hours, we de-
velop that social grace that makes goodness effective. That
is why I fecl that your work is so important.

James Truslow Adams said once (and I am sure my Eng-
lish and Canadian friends will understand), “The greatest
contribution America has made to the world is the Ameri-
can dream.” And he defined it thus: “It is the dream of a
land where life shall be richer and fuller and better, with
opportunity for every person according to his ability and
achievement.”

That is the dream with which America was born. That
dream must not die in our hands; and your task—and I
think mine, too—is to keep the faith of our fathers that it
may fulfill the dreams of our children.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE

HEALTH IN COLLEGES

Emotional difficulties and poor health habits seem to be
the major health problems of American college students, ac-
cording to results of a questionnaire sent to two hundred

college and university presidents for help in planning the
Fourth National Conference on Health in Colleges, to be
hcld May 5-8 in New York.

Answers to the questions asked by the conference presi-
dent, Jamcs L. Morrill, president of the University of Minne-
sota, also revealed that financing an adequate health serv-
ice and obtaining well-trained physicians are the chief ad-
ministrative problems.

Forty national organizations (the NRA is one of these)
interested in aspects of health and education arc joining
with the American Collcge Health Association in sponsor-
ing the conference. The NRA is interested in the close rela-
tion of health and recreation, and in working with these

APRIL 1954

other organizations to bring about a realization and active
acknowledgment of this fact.

The conference theme is: Teamwork in Meeting the
Health Needs of College Students. The conference objec-
tives are: (1) to consider ways of protecting and improving
the health of college students through comprehensive and
integrated programs of health service and health education;
and (2) to formulate suggestions for relating college health
programs to all other college functions.’

The conference program will include sixteen working
committees in which college and university presidents,
deans, physicians, nurses, psychologists, specialists in rec-
reation, specialists in physical education and health educa-
tion, student counselors, and students will pool their knowl-
edge and experience to develop comprehensive health pro-
grams integrated with all other college functions.

Previous conferences were held in 1931, 1936, and 1947.

A plea for the preservation of city parks

 

CRY, the beloved City

THROUGH hickories and hemlocks and wild hydrangeas, a
cool stream of water, talking to itself, flows down a rocky
groove toward the creek below. A crow is calling, and cica-
das are tuning up for the night. Once in a while a distant zoo
sound, or the calling of little children drifts into the woods,
accenting its quiet and peacefulness. Above me the late af-
ternoon sun explores the crown of a great tulip tree and finds
birds there, singing. I have finally found the most wonder-
ful part of a wonderful city.”

Thus I wrote home after having discovered Washington
D.C.’s Rock Creek Park during a brief military visit to the
capital during World War II. On future visits to the city it
became one of my first objectives.

Rock Creek Park has recently been threatened with de-

 

Alfred G. Etter

struction. Yet I feel that this may be fortunate for it may
draw attention to one of the most tragic events of our time—
thc nationwide destruction of our metropolitan play places.
The narrow ribbon that is Rock Creek is currently being
considered as the site for a hundred-foot superhighway
down its very middle. If this “improvement” goes through,
it will be a fatal blow to the beauty of the park, and the im-
pressivc dignity which spreads from it through all those
parts of the city which it touches.

Rock Creek is the easy answer to a traffic manager’s prob-
lem of how to handle the tides of traffic that beat against the
white buildings; but Rock Creek, as a symbol, cannot be
sacrificed before the god of gasoline. Rock Creek, and every
other city park once established, should be inviolate. We

“In no place has nature been more bountiful . . . With its drives and walks, its forests and open fields, its repose and
tranquility, Rock Creek is possessed with all the features necessary to provide a park worthy of a great people.”—Major
N. Miehler, in 1366, reporting to the United States Senate on the suitability of the valley of Rock Creek as a public park.

RECREATION

would not think of bisecting the Washington Monument, or
any one of a thousand cold memorials over the land, yet we
hack away at city parks using one subterfuge after another,
even though the parks are a part of our heritage, and honor
the memory, not of mere men, but of God and the natural
world.

The capital government now has an opportunity to set an
example, to demonstrate to city planners whether the country
moves forward on the basis of planning for the peeple’s
good, or on the basis of improvisations to meet exigencies.

As a part of my responsibility, looking after recreational
interests in connection with water resource development, I
prepared the following statement: “Our nation is strong
because it was built on a foundation of strong men of strong
mind and strong physique. The ingenuity, vigor, and keen
powers of observation of the American pioneer were essen-
tial ingredients of our success. They are no less a part of
our survival. These are traits which spring from the intimate
contact of man with nature. Indefinite preservation of a
frontier of new land is impossible, yct preservation of the
Opportunity for men to associate with natural land and water
in a challenging relationship is both possible and essential
to a healthy p0pulation and national philosophy. There is
little doubt that this contact should be as intimate and as
frequent as possible, to be effective. It should not be re-
stricted to once-yearly strenuous excursions across country,
though these have their places. The essential thing in the
preservation of spirit and individuality is the briefer spon-
taneous rest which leads to ideas, which restores to an other-
wise machine-like existence the dignity of the human imagi-
nation.

“There has been a trend toward longer week-ends and
more frequent prolonged holidays, and these trends have
shown a profit in terms of efficiency. To realize maximum
profits, it will be essential that these leisure hours are not
merely the dead inactivity of a machine shut down for the
holidays, but that they provide the individual with incentive
and time to think. By providing people with convenient
access to a contrasting environment, the nation, state, and
especially the city and its adjoining areas, can insure that
fresh thinking may be continually felt in the ultimate de-
cisions which the people of a democratic nation must make.

“The natural course of events within a highly industri-
alized nation slowly leads to a destruction of the oppor-
Itunity for convenient recreation. Cities are seldom planned
with any view to the future welfare of their residents. Un-
controlled urban expansion annihilates rural environs at the
same time that need for these areas increases. Today cities
are Spreading into the suburbs at an alarming rate. Farm
lands are rapidly becoming subdivision real estate. Demand
for suburban living, even country living by city workers is
driving the price of fringe lands so high that communities
think they cannot afford to buy them for parks and recrea-
tion areas.

 

DR. ETTER, currently associate researchist with the Wash-
ington University School of Medicine, serves as resident
director, Clapton Experimental 1" arm, Clarksville, Missouri.

APRIL 1954

“Daily access to natural scenes and opeii space has become
a thing of the past for downtown residents except in a few
far-sighted cities. Not only do evening rides or week-end
trips now require excessive driving, but nearly half of our
city people still do not have access to an automobile. Trolley
trips and bus rides that once took passengers into pleasant
country in a few minutes now seldom strike unscttlcd areas
in less than forty-five minutes, if at all. Boys on bikes,
searching for a place to build a campfire and cook a lunch,
have to travel treacherous miles on crowded Speedways. Re-
laxation gained by a day at the beach or in the mountains
is destroyed by a frustrating and dangerous drive on
crowded sign-and-shack-spattered highways. The pollution
of rivers and streams near and for miles below cities, factor-
ies, and mines is a modern tragedy. New generations will
not imagine that beauty once existed where sewage, trash.
and exudations of industry now contaminate the scene.

“Any place we look, we have destroyed our own oppor-
tunity for experiencing the stimulation of outdoor recreation.
It is a plain but bitter truth that ‘Man always kills the things
he loves the most.’

“When we add to all this the closing in of world forces on
the future of individuals of all ages, and the threat of atomic
and bacteriological warfare, we are faced with the definite
danger that a natural craving for first-hand freedom, unless
somehow given adequate opportunity for expression, will
seek its own violent outlet. Recreation is the major field
where such opportunity is apt to be found.”

I further stated, “I want a world that is beautiful enough
to inspire me, to make me rise to its defense at the slightest
provocation. I like shade on a hot day. I like kites on a
March day. I want to see the thrill of discovery in my son’s
eyes, even if it is only a hollow tree full of owls or a crawfish
under a stone that he finds. I want him to have some inkling
as to his place in a society of living things. I think we all
need something around to remind us that there are things
which are bigger than man, like mountains and trees, older
than man, like rocks, things that man can’t make, like grass,
and things so complicated that man can’t understand them,
like the rich fresh soil.”

That’s where the rub has been for years! No suggestions
were made concerning how you measure recreation. Bene-
fits to the nation from other phases of water develOpment
are measured in terms of dollars, or time, or bushels and
pounds. But recreation has no dimensions. If we tap enough
maple trees we can make a pound of sugar, if we boil the sap
long enough; but what does that tell us of’ the majesty of an
old sugar grove? Can we boil down aesthetic and physical
enjoyment and benefit into hrutal terms like “man-days”
and “recreation dollars”? You can’t tell me that any think-
ing nation should ever seriously decide the value of a duck-
marsh on the basis of the market price of Pekin ducks, or
rate a boy’s Saturday in the woods worthless because it did
not cost anything! Opportunities for recreation will develop
or be perpetuated only to the extent that the people and their

government feel morally bound to provide and preserve
such experience for themselves and their successors.

The National Park Service has at times been forced to

, 209

resort to the “man-day” measure of its service to the nation.
Knowing this, I always wonder when I enter a park, and
realize that I am spending a man-day, whether I am going to
get everything that is coming to me. Actually the term con-
ceals as much as it reveals. It doesn’t indicate in any way the
quality of the experience or the amount of torment or stress
that was involved getting where we wanted to go. Man-days
say nothing about how available the relaxation is, its dis-
tinctiveness, cleanness, freedom from interruption, and the
contrast which it offers to our daily existence.

There is also a tendency to measure recreation in terms
of area, acres of land in national parks or forests, state parks,
county parks, sea shore areas, metropolitan parks, and so
forth. Recreation land cannot be segregated and depart-
mentalized. We must become less area conscious and more
Opportunity conscious. Recreation land is where you find
it; and areas, above certain minimums, are not an accurate
measure. Ecologists have found that an area supports life
more in proportion to the variety of the vegetation or the
extent of edge or border areas than in relation to total acre-
age, and so it is with many successful city parks, as with
Rock Creek. They are long and narrow, but contain con-

trasts, groves and grasses and streams with gardens, playing
fields, walks and tangles of wild wood.

The federal government receives a great deal of criticism
for meddling in the private affairs of local governments, yet
the one place where they have scarcely meddled at all is one
of the weakest spots in local administration—that is the field
of recreation area and park establishment. The federal gov-
ernment has an enviable record in the preservation of great
natural playgrounds, scenic reserves, wilderness and forest
areas and national monuments, though they are only fifty per
cent of what we need to meet existing demands, and even
these are constantly being threatened by private interests, or
by public developments pushed by other governmental agen-
cies for their own aggrandizement.

Much of the federal interest in parks came as a concomi-
tant to orgies of interest in forest and soil conservation
which passed over the heads of city governments. Cities felt,
if they thought about it at all, that they had nothing to do
with these processes. Consequcntly, metropolitan areas havc
done littlc voluntarily to conserve what was left of the heauti-
ful within their limits, especially during their recent attacks
of hyperplasia. In days gone by, philanthropists bequeathed
much land to citics for use as parks, and but for such pure
good luck, many cities would today be almost parkless. For
a long time now most big cities have been coasting along
with these old gifts, gradually reducing the wild areas to
make room for more and more picnic benches, incinerators,
asphalt playgrounds and parking lots, amphitheaters and
superhighways. It wasn’t long ago that I read a rather
lengthy article on the effects of erosion in Central Park.
Perhaps the city may be obliged to use asphalt there too. It
suggests that conservation after all may not be too academic
a problem for the city. I

Suburban communities in metropolitan areas have a few
little inherited parks, but these are rapidly being eroded too.
In the meantime, every vacant lot is built on, school yards

210

are abbreviated, island farms have been subdivided, and
even cemeteries give way for shopping centers. One wishes
that here, if nowhere else, suburbs and cities could learn to
cooperate and plan together. It is high time that in this field,
which is peculiarly its own, local government take action.

The hope of the future depends upon five things: First,
and foremost, the preservation of Rock Creek Park, the finest
park in the nation’s capital, as a symbol of the inviolate
nature and fundamental importance of convenient recreation
in natural surroundings within the cities of the nation.

Second, an intensive campaign, by individuals and groups
which hold these things important, to carry the problems to
the cities and metropolitan and county governments urging
attractive cities that people can be proud of, rather than
ashamed. After all, most of us spend almost every living
hour in the city.

Third, a rededication of the rich to the beautifying of the
city, not by gifts of money for monumental edifices, but
through gifts of land; large private holdings and estates are
constantly being surrounded by objectionable developments
and consequently no longer considered desirable by their
owncrs. These lands offer great opportunities. While phi-
lanthrOpy of this sort seems to have given way to the estab-
lishment of research foundations, especially for medical re-
search, perhaps it would be well to make what life we have
more pleasant rather than to search for the fountain of youth,
cspecially if this “youth” is to be spent boxed up in a twenti-
eth century city. There can surely be no gift appreciated by
more people more often for so long than green corners of
spacious parks, provided the terms of the gift are such as
to prevent slow dismemberment.

Fourth, the hope that employers will realize the importance
of convenient recreation and attractive settings, and thus be
led to set aside areas within reach of their new suburban
plants and offices for the enjoyment of their employees.

Fifth, the possible inclusion of provisions in building per-
Inits which require real-estate developers to provide a mini-
mum of play-space for each acre deveIOped. As long as
cities are built on the subdivision basis, this will be the only
certain way to provide play places at convenient distances
for future pOpulations.

I am writing this now having just seen one of the most
beautiful woods I have ever known bulldozed into nothing-
ness. Today, yellow hills and flimsy houses stretch over two
hundred acres that in 1936 were bought for a mere $60,000
as an investment. It was a good investment all right, for this
year it sold for three times as much; but if it had been
bought as a park, and preserved as an impressive island in an
industrial community, its value would have been immeasur-
ablc, not to be reckoned in such earthly items as dollars or
acres, but in inspiration, education, relaxation and exercise.
Ironically, the desert which has been created from it has
been called Forestwood, and its main street is Meadowcrest.
So we salve our consciences and confuse our descendants!

Thoreau once said, “In wilderness is the salvation of the
world.” I suspect that he would be glad to subscribe to the
corollary' that in parks like Rock Creek is thc salvation of
the city!

RECREATION

From Talk Given at Florida Park and Recreation Institute, 1953

PARKS are for people—strange as it

may sometimes seem. People go to
parks for recreation. Whether the pro-
fessional park man calls it “education”
(conservation or outdoor), or “inter-
pretative service,” or by whatever name
—it is still recreation to the park pa-
tron. Recreation, in part, is a learning
process; but the park visitor is pleasure

bent.

flowers, to the other extreme of provid-
ing every form of elaptrap noise and so-
called amusement at its gaudiest height.

So it seems that the level-headed park
man who is alert to modern man, his
social problems and his great hunger
and need for fitting and constructive
outdoor recreation, should now face the
problem more realistically. He needs to
examine his parks and his program in
the light of the population’s needs, and

various levels of parks, have their own
policies governing what will be allowed
or what will not be allowed in park
areas in the way of recreation. They
range from the one extreme, where the
park visitor is limited to passive ree-
reation of the type enjoyed by that once
well-known bovine playboy, Ferdinand
the Bull, sitting and smelling the pretty

to initiate some sound approach to serv-
ing these vital needs. It is either do this
or perish! Yes, perish in a land of fan-
tastie dreaming of the ideal park where
natural ecology reaches its highest state.
With the provision, of course. that man
never sets foot thereon as he is the low-
est form of animal that could invade the
park heaven. Park planning would be
simple and park operation could be a
pleasure, of course, if we did not have
to consider man. But strangely enough

William M. Hay

parks are for man, and therein lies our
problem because he is still basically an
outdoor animal.

Actually, the challenge is great; the
need for the outdoor type of recreation
for which your parks are best suited is
critical. I do not plan to lay out a pro-
gram for each of your parks. Nor do I
intend to present to you an answer to the
problem that confronts you. That is for
you to do collectively and individually.
But do something; then next year get
together, swap ideas and plan to do
more the following year.

As a guide to your thinking and to
encourage discussion, I am going to de-
scribe an approach used a few years
ago in some state parks. It is a practi-
cal method and got results. 

It was based on the simple theory that
all people have a desire to play whether
they realize it or not. By finding out a
few of their existing interests, others
can be developed by first offering things
familiar to them. The resources and fa-
cilities of a park have definite values
and opportunities for extensive use if
proper direction is given. As a point of
departure, study your park and its ree-
reational opportunities. Analyze your
public and determine some of its lead-
ing interests. Guide Elie publie into us-

ing what you have.
Fifteen years ago, people of the South

generally did not know what to do at a
state park. All they did, as a result,
was drive through on sightseeing trips.
The use of swimming, pienieking, in-
formal play field, recreation lodge and
other day-use facilities was so limited
that keeping them open was hardly jus-

tified.
Soon it was decided that an effort

211

would be put forth to familiarize the
people with the recreational opportuni-
ties in the parks. First a list of all clubs
and organizations in an approximate
twenty—five-mile radius (zone of use) was
made. All of them were then contacted
by letter inviting them to the park. In-
formation relative to meeting dates,
purpose of club and recreational inter-
est was- requested. Park personnel
sought an opportunity to meet with the
more important organizations to tell
them of the park’s program and facili-
ties. At this meeting a movie was shown.
The ways in which the park could servc
the group were described. Services of
park personnel were offered in assisting
them with the first outing.

Many groups immediately asked for
help. They came, enjoyed a variety of
activities, learned of others they could
enjoy. As a result, these clubs made
many repeat visits, the various individ-
uals coming back with their families or
groups of friends. In repeat visits they
were introduced to more of the oppor-
tunities of the park which appealed to
their recreational appetites.

Group outings, social parties indoors,
fish fries, square dances, day outings,
swimming instruction, water safety in-
struction, day camping, family reun-
ions, county-wide club meetings and
many unique types of special events re-
sulted. They grew out of joint planning
between park personnel, industrial
groups, city recreation departments,
and the various types of clubs and or-

ganizations.

The value of close relationship of all
recreational agencies was realized.
Keeping each other informed and joint
planning of events by city, county and
state park and recreation agencies

reaped helpful dividends.

In special events, water pageants,
archery tournaments, mock hunts, horse
and buggy field trials, fox hunts, nature
walks, camp leadership training, na-
tional aquatic school and day camping
indicate the variety. but not the range.

Percentage-wise, over-all park attend-
ance increased one hundred per cent in
one year. Participation in park activi-
ties increased two hundred per cent.
Park revenue more than doubled. Pro-
tection and respect of property grew.
Vandalism was nil. Total loss to the
park for things broken or destroyed was
only a few dollars per year. But most of
all, peOp'e learned to use the park. They
learned to appreciate it and to protect
it. They became staunch supporters be-
cause they got a great return on their
tax investment. They knew that their
children, while learning new skills, were
having-fun in a wholesome environment.

“Zone of use” has been used to indi-
cate the area in which most people are
served by a given park. This term is
used to indicate the approximate maxi-
mum travel. distance which the public
will go for a day-use activity. This dis-
tance will vary in relationship to the at-
tractiveness of the facilities, to the rec-
reational opportunities, to ease of ac-

l

cess and to competitive areas or facili-
ties. Each recreation area has a definite
zone of use, even though there are some
variables. The zone for each park can
be determined. This of course is im-
portant. We know, for example, that a
city playground attracts users up to a
half-mile while a playfield will attract
them up to a mile. As far as parks are
concerned, the zone of influence is not
static. It expands as the park grows in
recreational attraction and shrinks as
the attraction diminishes.

In summary, we might, therefore, say
that there are a few basic guides in se-
curing good recreational use of a park.
These are true of a city, county or state
park. They call for experimentation and
ingenuity:

1. Take inventory of the full re-
sources of your park’s natural and man-
made attractions.

2. Determine the zone of use of each

park.

3. Determine some of the recrea-
tional needs of the population within
your zone of use.

4. Secure the interest of the popula-
tion by getting in touch with organized
groups and by working closely with
other park and recreation agencies.

5. Give the people help in using your
facilities and resources to the fullest
extent.

It is not a question of : Can we af.
ford to have recreation in parks? We
cannot afford to do without it.

Trailer Brings Music Instruction

Music is being recommended by both American educators and

psychologists as an aid in developing character and personality
as well as a way to reduce tension and to help youngsters find
creative outlets. It is beneficial in achieving teamwork and co-
operation with a group of children. The creativeness of making
music is a stimulation to the young imagination, and the physi-
cal coordination required to play a musical instrument encour-
ages good health habits.

A most unusual music program is the one in Colorado, con-
ducted by Lloyd Bader who travels sixty thousand miles a year
in a trailer to provide music classes for the rural areas and live
cities within a forty-mile radius.

The children are given class instruction in their own towns,
then transported to a central point for orchestral and band prac-
tice twice each week. Mr. Bader has had eight large bands,
several orchestras and many small novelty instrumental groups
since he began his trailer teaching. This program is under the
auspices of the American Music Conference and local school
boards; however, the idea can be adapted to the recreation field.

Mobilizing for the

Recreation Congress

0 The strength and influence of the National Recreation
Congress through the years has in large measure rested on
two basic processes. One has involved widespread partici-
pation of lay and professional leaders, public and private,
in planning the various sessions and events. The other is
the unquestioned principle of giving emphasis to thosc
things which seem to be of greatest value to the recreation
movement as a whole. Resisting normal human pressures
for specific cnthusiasms which did not seem to be in bar-
mony with the larger purpose, the National Recreation
Congress, with the help of a large number of committees, has
continued to serve the movement and to stand out as an ex-
ample of democracy in action.

Oncc again we are mobilizing the thoughtful participation
of the movement in preparation for the St. Louis Recreation
Congress, September 27-October 1. Creation of committees
for special tasks does not in any way relieve delegates of
the opportunity and obligation to forward their individual
suggestions. A great many have already been received, but
if you have ideas which should be considered, they should
bc sent immcdiately to Congress headquarters, 315 Fourth

Avenue, Ncw York 10, New York.

MR. POMEROY and Mr. Fagin have
set forth very ably the “why” of

comprehensive long-range city planning
and of making the planning of systems
of recreation facilities a part of that
process. It is my purpose to describe
something of the “how” of developing,
within the framework of a master plan
for all aspects of community develop-
ment, the phase of the plan dealing with
recreation areas.

This kind of planning is not merely
a technical job; it is also both an edu-
cational and a political job. If the plan-
ning is going to be successful—that is,
if it is going to result in the buying of
land and the construction of facilities
within which an effective program of
recreation can be provided—you have
to build into the process itself the me-
chanics of the fulfillment of the plan.

The Machinery for Planning

There are at least three parts to the
machinery for planning, corresponding
to the tripartite nature of the operation.
The Hrst, for the technical work, is that
composed of the hired hands—a pro-
fessional team requiring various re-

IN THE MODERN CITY

sources and abilities. It would normal-
ly be composed of the staff of the rec-
reation agency itself, with its specinc
technical know-how, and the staff of the
planning agency, whose contribution
lies in coordinating the recreation re-
quirements with the other aspects of
long-range community development.
Both obviously need a certain minimum
level of competence, but even more im-
portant is a reasonable level of harmony
between the two, so as to assure a rec-
reation-system plan which at the same
time ties in with the over-all picture,
and sufficiently nts the specialized needs
and resources of the community to be
put to use by the recreation agencies.

The second part of the machinery is
that involved in official steps to put the
plan into effect; the process requires a
measure of political concurrence with
each step-by-step decision, starting with
the decision to make a plan in the hrst
place. Nearest to the technicians are the
agency boards themselves; planning
commission, school board, recreation
board. Next are the top-level admin-
istrative heads: mayor, city manager,
department heads (not excluding the
Hnance director or his counterpart) . At
the top, normally, is the legislative
body, the city council that has to ap-

propriate the funds both for capital im-
provements and for operation and main-
tenance of facilities. All of these are es-
sential cogs in the wheels of the ma-
chinery that actually gets plans built.

The third and absolutely essential
part is the civic sounding board, the in-
strument for citizen participation in the
process. Here the need is for represen-
tation from those groups who speak for
the community itself, and to whose
voice the political ear is attuned. The
resources for this leadership are differ-
ent in each community. There are the
boards and staffs of private recreation
agencies, or their spokesmen from cen-
tral community-chest organizations.
There are city-wide civic groups which
may already be concerned with the sub-
ject. If there are not already existent
such recreation-oriented groups, they
may need to be called into being; and
in this task the techniques of commu-
nity organization will be needed, in
which the recreation agency staff has
special competence. In particular, there
are the local citizen associations, com-
munity improvement societies, block
groups, area councils, and the like——
these representing what might be identi-
ned as the ultimate consumers of the
recreation services and the recreation

RECREATION

facilities that are thc end product of the
planning. Though they come last in the
list, the importance of hringing them
into the process is perhaps first.

Each of these three plays its part, in
every stage of the process that starts
with a general desire for better recre-
ation and culminates with the first pitch
on a new softball diamond or the first
dive into a new swimming pool.

Standards and Goal-Setting

The planning process itself may he
dividcd, perhaps arbitrarily, into four
stages. The first is the setting of stand-
ards; the second, making a survey of
existing facilities; third, the designing
of thc plan itself; and fourth, the work-
ing up of the program for carrying it
into actuality.

The first stage starts with the major
policy decisions described by Mr. Fa-
gin. This evaluation of the general kind
and quality of recreation program need-
ed is the very foundation stone of stand-
ards for specific facilities that will be
meaningful. This is a difficult step, for
which there is no prescription. It needs
the guidance of the recreation special-
ists, as to the range of possibilities. It
needs the contribution of the city plan-
ners, as to the long-range potentials of
the community for growth and change
of character. It needs the eXpression of
the needs and wants of the too-often-in-
articulate consumer, eXpressed through
the civic leader; and the acquiescence,
if not the actual leadership, of the polit-
ical powers. But, difficult as it is, this
crystallization of goals is explicitly ne-
cessary as a guide to all that follows, ex-
cept in the simplest kind of community.

AftBr the generalized goal-setting
comes the setting of standards. The
formulation of these is primarily a tech-
nical function; the problem becomes
one of expressing them simply enough
that they can be understood, and ac-
ccptcd as a basis for design and then

action. For the kinds of standards are
legion, and the variations in each kind
of standard are also many.

“National” standards are a useful
point of departure. They can be found,
ably thought through and set forth, in
the publications of the National Recrea-
tion Association, the reports of various
special recreation studies for particular
citics, and the reports of many city

APRIL 1954

planning agencies. But national stand-
ards have been descrihed as for “the
lazy or conscienceless,” because it can
be dangerous to apply them thoughtless-
ly to any community or any part of a
community. For instance, “one and
one-quarter acres of playground space
for every thousand of total p0pulation”
is perhaps the most widely known na-
tional standard for this onc type of fa-
cility; but if it is correct for a city of
five thousand made up of a normal
range of family-types and ageagroups,
it is obviously incorrect for ,a housing
project of five thousand with an ab-
normally large number of children per
family, or for a downtown residential
area made up of elevator apartments
with almost no children per family. The
greatest usefulness of statements on na-
tional standards, or reports from other
cities, is the lead they give on the meth-
od of deriving a standard: the kind of
assumptions that must be made and the
steps of thinking through to a usable
figure.

It is interesting to compare for a num-
ber of cities the space-per-population
standards for, say, playgrounds. The
initial shock is that they are so differ-
ent: half an acre per thousand people
in one city, one acre in another, an
acre and a quarter in a third. Can it
be that the children in one community
really need only half as much space to
run around in as those in another? The
key to the difference, of course, is in the
differing assumptions that underlie the
standards. A carefully-made forecast

#

Owing to the length of the
material in this series, Mr.
Howard’s talk will be com-

pleted in the May issue of
RECREATION.

 

that the ratio of children to total p0pu-
lation in a central city will be far below
“average” or “normal” in the future is
probably a valid justification of a “low”
standard. Thc fact that land costs twice
as much per square foot in one city as
in another, however, is not a valid ex-
cuse for chiseling a “standard,” though
it may be a very real reason for not
planning to meet the standard in the

near future.

An exploration of the process of com-
posing such a standard shows Up a num-
ber of other kinds of assumptions that
are subject to valid differences. You
start with the playground itself; if it is
made up of such and such facilities, its
capacity is so many children—eighteen
on the ball diamond, two on each see-
saw, and so forth (and even these fig-
ures are not completely cut and dried).
Then comes the flying leap into con-
jecture: what total p0pulation (of all
ages) does a playground of this capa-
city serve? First, from how far away
will the children come? This will vary,
even in different parts of the same city.
Next, what should be the ratio of play-
ground capacity to the total number of
children in the service area? Must you
be able to provide for all of them at
one time? The percentage that come at
once will vary, hy age, by social custom,
by weather, and probably most by qual-
ity of supervision, program, and main-
tenance—and how can you predict that
in advance? Finally, what is the ratio
of children of playground age to total
population? This, too, is subject to
wide variation. So a realization of what
is behind this kind of standard carries
with it at least two warnings. First, the
only safe kind of a standard to use is
one which is locally derived, calculated
from assumptions geared to the varia-
tions of your community from the aver-
age, and based on as many kinds of
local information as you can get on
population characteristics, local habits,
and the like. Second, even thus care-
fully derived a standard is still a blunt
tool, not to be applied slavishly or with
too much precision; it is useful only as a

‘general guide.

I have used a playground as an illus-
tration because it is probably the one
recreation facility whose capacity and
use it is easiest to calculate. How much
more diflicult, then, is the deriving of a
standard for neighborhood parks, for
passive recreation? One oflice I worked
with had some fun figuring such a
park’s capacity on a moonlit night, with
COUples spaced twenty feet apart and,
assuming that the couples represcnted
twenty-five per cent of theage twenty
to twenty-five p0pulation within a quar-
ter-mile, we came up with a “standard.”
It probably makes as much sense as any

215

other; in fact, it was remarkably close
to the one you will find in the book.

But in spite of the problems and pit-
falls involved in working up a set of
standards, figures that are both mean-
ingful and useful can be developed. In-
deed, the yardstick they provide is al-
most a necessity in explaining, as well
as in designing, a recreation area plan.
The number of yardsticks needed is
somewhat dismaying. There follows a
list of the most important, with the fig-
ures carefully omitted, because to in-
clude them would be flatly at variance
with the whole principle of local stand-
ards that has ust been so stressed.

o The initial kind of standard deals
with the facilities to be included in the
recreation system, some of which can
be keyed to a particular age group, but
many of which cannot; some are clearly
for active recreation, some for passive,
and some cannot be sorted out on this
line; some are indoor, some outdoor,
and some are both. The familiar list
starts with playlots, playgrounds, play-
fields, neighborhood parks, large parks,
natural reservations—all useful desig-
nations of areas that can be fairly clear-
ly differentiated as to function and use.
They lend themselves to “standard”
techniques of analysis and planning, at
the level of community-wide planning,
dealing with the location and size of
sites for facilities, that is here under dis-
cussion. The list then goes on into spe-
cial facilities that are of necessity also
specialized in their planning because of
their size or unusual site requirements:
golf courses, beaches, zoos, arboretums,
for instance. Then there are some that
can be combined with some of the first
list (which can in some cases, of course,
be combined with each other): swim-
ming pools, recreation center buildings.

Probably only the metropolitan com-
munity has both the need and the re-
sources for all of these things. The se-
lection from the list, for other commu-
nities, will be guided by the broad poli-
cies and goals as to the recreation sys-
tem with which the planning process
started.

0 The second kind of standard has al-
ready_ been referred to as the areaipop-
ulation standard, which may be ex-
pressed for each of the functional types
of facility in acres per thousand total

216

population, or population per hundred
acres, or number of children of such

and such age group per acre or per hun-
dred acres. The device used is not sig-
nificant; the purpose is to identify an
optimum relationship between the land
area to be devoted to a particular rec-

reation function and the people who
will use it.

0 A third kind of standard deals with

service district and frequency of use.
Facilities for daily use within walking

 " 

distance might include playlots (if
any), playgrounds, and neighborhood
parks; those for less frequent regular
use, still within easy transit or long
walking distance, might be playfields,
recreation center buildings, and large
city parks; those for occasional use
only, accessible only by auto or transit,
might be reservations, beaches, zoos.
The “standard” would express area-
population ratios in the same terms as
the previous standard; but a useful ad-
ditional dimension is present. A city
may seem to have enough total acres of
playground for its total population, but
when this service-district standard is
applied the surplus of playground acre-
age in one neighborhood clearly does
not help meet the deficiency in another.

Standards of accessibility must be
thought through, not only to contribute
to the kind of standard described in the
previous paragraph, but also to guide
site selection. Distance is not so signifi-
cant as time, which counts in method of
travel. Using a compass to mark off
quarter-mile circles on a map is a tempt-
ing labor-saver for the planner; but, ob-
viously, many children within that cir-
cle must walk more than a quarter of a
mile to reach the center of the circle.
And for those facilities that are intend-
ed for children, time-distance is not the
only criterion of accessibility; there
may also be standards of safety, requir-
ing the absence of trafiic hazards on the
way, or “attractive nuisances,” or pool
halls and beer joints.

0 Then there are standards of location,

varying for each type of functional fa-
cility. Factors of site suitability enter:

for instance, relatively flat topography
is necessary for most of a playfield area
to be devoted to ball diamonds and foot-

ball fields, but rolling or even rugged
t0pography may be preferable for a
park area intended for informal com-

munion with nature. Factors of linkage
are also of importance: given a choice,
it makes more sense to put a playground
for elementary school age children next
to such a school than at some distance
from it; and there are other types of

 

areas that fit, in terms of usage, either
with each other or with non-recreational
facilities. Factors of environment may
also be identified: you try not to put a
playlot next to a saloon, or a formally
landscaped garden-park in the lee of an
industrial area notorious for fumes
harmful to vegetation. A final feature
of location standards might be factors
of service district relationship: the type
of play area intended for daily use by
children should probably be within, if
not central to, the neighborhood for
whose children it is meant—in other
words, within its service district; while
at the other extreme is, for instance, the
beach, which almost has to be at the
edge of its service district, or the large
natural reservation which is likely to be
(and, because of the kind of use it gets,
can pr0perly be) outside its service dis-
trict entirely.

0 Lastly are listed standards of design.
At the level of planning here under dis-
cussion, I do not mean construction
standards as to type and thickness of
pavement, or horticultural standards;
but rather, sufficient decision as to the
kind and number of specific facilities to
be provided in each type of recreation
area to determine a minimum and an
optimum size for each such area, and
also to throw light on its apprOpriate
location. For instance, a play space for
active recreation for concentrated num-
bers of children, which by all criteria
ought to be within a residential area,
obviously needs a substantial noise kill-
ing buffer around it if it is not to be a
value-destroying nuisance. Such a land-
scaped buffer area adds to the neces-

RECREATION

sary size of the playground, and thus in-
fluences size standards. If playgrounds
are to be divided into junior and senior
types, with a ball diamond for the sen-
iors and none for the juniors, here
again is a major influence on the space
requirements which is also reflected in
the area-population-ratio standard.

Here, then, arc six kinds of stand-
ards, there may even be others, and
these have not been fully described.
They play a double part in the balance
of the planning process; they are the
basis for the evaluation of existing facil-
ities, and then for the design of the new
plan. These later stages may throw new
light on the standards themselves, and
suggest modifications. Even so, it is
well for the technicians who develop
them to share them at the beginning
with both oflicials and public groups, to-
gether with the reasoning behind them.
At best, they should be widely reviewed
and discussed, and then formally adopt-
ed by the recreation agency and the
planning agency. This step is advised,
not merely for the psychological advan-
tage of getting in, on the ground floor
of the planning operation, as many as
possible of those who must be dcpended
upon to later build the plan. Techni-
cians sometimes trust their techniques
too much; if they cannot sell their stand-
ards, perhaps they are not really good
standards. Further, lay review and dis-
cussion may very well bring out ideas
that were overlooked; or information
that was unknown. Wide public partici-
pation is not merely good political tech-

CHILDREN’S
Z00

If you are looking for a big package
of recreation to give the public for to-
day’s dollar, give them a “kids’ zoo.”
Shreveport is doing this for 100,000
zoo visitors during the four-month sum-
mer season. It does not take much land
and it costs little to maintain—in fact,
you can get most of the animals for the
feeding. The recreation department con-
_structed a children’s zoo, that today is

nique; but good technical technique.

The Recreation Area Survey

The second major stage of the plan-
ning operation is the taking of an inven-
tory of the existing recreation system,
and the analyzing of its service. Knowl-
edge of what you have is an obvious
prerequisite to deciding what you want.

Such an inventory would involve list-
ing and mapping each kind of function-
al facility, togcther with its size, its serv-
ice district, and whatcver else may be
pertinent to an evaluation of its ade-
quacy. Data 011 actual use would be
helpful: by how many, how often, and
from how far away. Data on differences
in equipment, maintenance, or program
and supervision may throw light on dif-
ferences in use between areas that are,
at first look, identical. Clearly the rec-
reation system cannot be analyzed in a
vacuum; data are also needed on pop-
ulation, housing types and densities,
age group composition, and the like;
and also maps are needed showing ma-
jor streets, railroads and other kinds of
linear breaks and boundaries, and non-
residential land uses of various types.

This kind of information makes pos-
sible a check of the existing facilities—
each individually, and all together as
a system—“against the standards as a
set of yardsticks. Such an evaluation
will show up the adequacies and the
inadequacies: of range of types of facil-
ities, of quantity of space of various
kinds, of accessibility, of location, and
of design. It identifies the strong and

the home for twenty pet animals, at a
cost of $7,500. The zoo covers about an
acre and has a stockade 'style fence that
stands ten feet high and is made of red
cedar poles with the bark peeled off. It
costs about $2,500 a year upkeep; and
for the 100,000 visitors—nwho, for the
most part, are children—~this is inex-
pensive recreation. It takes a full-time
keeper with two assistants, during the
Open season, to care for the animals and
handle 900 people a day.

“The basic patterns are all about the
same,” stated Superintendent Clyde
Stallcup. “However, you have to add

the weak spots in the fabric of the rec-
reation system, as to general location
in the community and as to character.

Such a survey sets the size of the plan-
ning problem—nand the building prob-
lem-—-—that faces thc community. It is
itself an educational process. It edu-
cates the recreation agency and the
planners. And, if the results of the eval-
nation are clearly and forcefully set be-
fore them, it educates the oflicials and
the public. Once it is brought home to
them how far thc community is from
meeting the standards it has set for it-
self, their entire perspective toward rec-
reation as a public function may be
changed. Their sights may be raised
as they recognize the urgency of im-
provement.

Of course there is also a danger that
the officials may be scared off at this
point. The guardians of the purse-
strings are properly sensitive about
things that cost money, like land in
built-11p areas. This indicates a need
for tact in presenting the findings. It is
probably unwise to say something like
“This survey shows we need another
one hundred acres of playgrounds,
which at $2.00 a square foot will cost
$8,600,000.” It doesn’t sound nearly
so bad to say, “If we can afford to buy
five acres of playground space a year
for the next twenty years we can meet
our standard.” It is important, too, to
make it clear that the statement of de-
ficiencies is not itself a plan or pro-

gram; that comes next.
(To be continued)

something new each year for an attrac-
tion. This year we are displaying new
papier-maché animals that were made
by the children in the arts and crafts
classes on the playgrounds. We also let
pe0ple put on shows with their trained
pets—they go over big.” If you are
thinking in terms of having a kids’ zoo,
here are his recommendations: (1) visit
a city that has a zoo; (2) use only small
and baby pets; (3) start out with a few
animals and add some new ones each
year; and (4) have added attractions.

Unusual in the field of camping is this free camp for diabetic children

IT IS DARK NOW. Below my cabin runs the slow flowing Blue
Creek to meet the Kanawha River. Towering above are
massive hemlocks interSpersed with flowerng rhododendron
which make the surrounding mountains seem taller and
greener than in actuality. Occasionally is heard, from afar
on the hill, the wry cry of the screech owl, or the spill of the
man-made waterfall of the lake. Now passing over the cob-
blestone walk is a doctor making his rounds; his steps echo,
but all is serenely pcaceful. This is Kno-Koma (derived
from the words “no coma”) the only exclusively free camp
in the world for diabetic children.“ The Charleston and West
Virginia Diabetes Associations have sponsored nine days of
free camping a year for eight- to fifteen-year-old diabetic
boys and girls at Camp Camelot, donated by Carbide and
Carbon Chemicals Company. Camelot is one of three chil-
dren’s camps owned and operatcd by Carbide for its em-
ployees’ children. Fifty-five campers are sleeping peacefully,
and are checked cvery three hours during the night by one
of the five'staff physicians. Three registered dieticians have
finished their meal planning for tomorrow. Three cooks
have laid aside their pot-holders; and from my window I see
that the dispensary is dark—its fivc nurses and two lab tech-
nicians are soundly sleeping. The counseling staff of four
senior counselors and eight junior counselors have long re-

tired—the constant supervision of the diabetic child is very
tiring. All are volunteers—all are doing a splendid job of
making a camping job pleasurable for themselves and fifty-
five youngsters.

Kno-Koma, with its superb physical features, is located
forty-three miles from Charleston, near Glen, West Virginia,
on the edge of remote and sparsely settled Kanawha and
Clay Counties. Located centrally in a 53,000-acre tract of
woodland, near a federal game reserve, Kno-Koma is a
dream come true to the diabetic child, whether he comes
from a mansion in Wheeling, a farm near Lewisburg. a
tenement house in Charleston, a modest housing project in
Parkcrsburg—it all spells the same—fun in the out-of-doors.

Kno-Koma just finished its fourth year—each year adding
to its growth. The idea of a free diabetic camp for West
Virginia diabetic childrcn was originated by the West Vir-
ginia Medical Association Diabetes Committee, chaircd by

Dr. George P. Heffner, and assisted by Dr. Pid Miller, Mary
Davis, and Roland W. “Dubcy” Hamilton, who was the first
director—and through their undaunted efforts the camp has
progressed to what exists today. Kno-Koma lasts for nine
days, but for its volunteer staff and workers of the diabetes
association their work is much longer. Each year, meetings
in early February start the rigid, detailed planning. The
association is divided into committees on food procurement,
transportation, perishables, clean-up, program specialties,
cquipment, and advertising. Kno-Koma exists purely on con-
tributions and volunteer help; no solicitations are made, no

canvassing has been done, but fortunately it has been able
to go from year to year without cost to the child.

From the time the child leaves the New York Central
Railroad station in Charleston, until he returns nine days
later, his life is engulfed with new and varied interests. For
some it is their first train ride, for others it is the first time
away from their homes, but for all it means the start to camp
—a word fascinating to any boy or girl! The children are
given a physical check-up at the Charleston General Hos-
pital Clinic and the nurses prcpare a snack, which is loaded
aboard, and then, amidst the waving of hands and tightly
clutched fishpoles and powder boxes, the train is off. Each
parcnt brings his own child to Charleston, and all children
depart on the same train—heading into a whole different
world.

The train chugs through four tunnels and then between
oak-groved and hemlock-covered mountains to Middle Fork.
The campers disembark and hike over the mountain sidcs
onc and one-half miles to camp. The walk is eventful. The
trail, with hand rails along the steep inclines, leads them
along the side of a mountain; and stretching below is the
ribbon-like stream. They walk through an old sedge-cov-
ered meadow, and finally over the swinging bridgc that leads
to Kno-Koma.

When the camper arrives he is assigned a number that he
uses the rest of the week for bunk assignment, diet regula-
tion, insulin dosage, urine specimens, and doctor’s bed
check. Each diet is designated by a color—blue, red, yellow,
or black—and each camper is given a color card to indi-
cate his diet. Blue indicates 180 grams daily of carbohy-
drate, yellow 200 grams, red 225 grams and black 250 grams.
Meals are served by the color chart indicator. Each child is
told at the beginning of each meal the exact proportions that
his color group may have. Foods are purchased from whole-
sale houses and also donated by dietetic warehouses.

The program is action packed. By using the total facilities
of Camp Camelot, Kno-Koma is assured of a somewhat ideal-
istic program. .

The huge ex-railroad bell sounds its rising note at 7:00
A.M. With hurried steps the campers collect their urine speci-
mens for the morning, and all specimen bottles are placed in
a labeled cabin box and the junior counselor delivers the
entirc group of specimens to the laboratory technicians at
the dispensary. Immediately following specimen collections,
all campers, according to their assigned dosage, receive their
insulin and administer their own shots. It is only thc young-
est, first-year campers who are somewhat reluctant about
giving their own shots; but before the camp is over they are,
to some degree, “experts” in administering their own insulin,
and reading and charting their urine specimens—which they
are taught by the staff of doctors and nurses.

Following breakfast, a meal enjoyable to a camper wher-
ever he may bc, all campers start their kaper duties by cabin
assignment for the day. Bunks are made, floors arc swept,
bathrooms are scrubbed; and then they are ready for the
morning of instructional activities, with a rotary program
of riflery, crafts, horseback riding, and the sport of the day.
The sport may be archery, volleyball, softball, tennis, bad-
minton, horseshoes, or ping-pong. It is suggested they try

horseback riding and rifiery one of the two periods. Follow-
ing these activities, all eampers assemble at the lake for
swimming instruction under Red Cross qualified instructors,
with progressive abilities and skills adapted to each group.
The entire staff is on the water front for safety precaution.
It is strongly believed that all the staff members may not be
foremost in water rescue tactics, but their cautious eyes are
constantly on guard for every single bobbing and splashing
head. This just affords safety in triple measure. If the water
is chilly, the campers grab fishpoles and head for the lake.
The fish caught are cleaned by the camper. For some it is a
new cxperience, for others it is a matter-of-fact routine. With
his counselor, the diabetic camper learns to understand an-
other one of nature’s wonders.

Boating and canoeing are done under strict supervision.
Supervision must be close on the water front. The diabetic
“reaction” may come at any unexpected time-—-his reaction
to insulin because it has consumed all the available body
sugar. The reaction is only temporary if sugar is given
quickly. The diabetic responds rapidly and continues on
with the activity after being checked by one of the doctors.
Should the diabetic, due to the sudden change from routine
home life to that of camp activities, get a reaction and be
left alone, he would slowly drift into unconsciousness and

possibly convulsions. Therefore, to pull the camper quickly
out of this reaction, every staff member carries a small sugar
can with him at all times—permanent individual equipment
during diabetic camp. Every shock or reaction is recorded
by the counselor and given to the doctors who, at nightly
meetings, record the amount of insulin each camper will be
given the following day. This is checked in accordance with
diet, urine specimen and daily activity.

Lunch is followed by gay singing. These children enjoy
singing and greatly excel in this camp art.

Rest hour is a welcome spot in the day for all. It affords a
good time for writing post cards, provided free to the
camper, or reading comic books, or quiet gab sessions across
the foot of a bunk. Each must lie down—and some go to
sleep. This rest period length is regulated by daily activity

219

but is not under one and one-half hours.

In the afternoon the campers have a choice of crafts, folk
dancing, boating, canoeing, and exploring. As for the ex-
ploring, there are many changes from the city streets to this
outdoor life for these wide-eyed children. So, with canteen
and sugar cans clanging, the small group of ten or fiftcen
head for the high cliffs with the beechnut trees 011 top, or the
rock-bottom of the mountain stream searching for wood
newts, or watching the soaring red-tailed hawk, or catching
a terrapin with its yellow and brown markings, or digging in
that old rotten log—and what is more exciting than watch-
ing a black snake devour his toad meal, or simply sitting in
the grass and watching those “funny little black bugs”?

Plaster casting is a rare treat— especially the casting of decr

tracks which are plentiful.

In their craft lesson, for some it may be making a lanyard,
billfold, or key case from vinylite plastic, or silk screening

Craft lessons include such things as the making of bill-
folds, lanyards, belts, Indian beadwork and finger painting.

—-—In(lian bead work, finger painting, or making a bird house
out of bark.

Folk dancing is an active class for all age-groups. For
some it is their first try in the field of dance, and they learn
what square dancing and folk dancing are all about. The
activity is fast moving, but all take time out for a snack to
build up their body-sugar content.

Every other day the entire camp delves into inter-cabin
competition in volleyball and softball games, and finally,
near the end of camp, into a softball game, with the staff
versus the campers. The loscrs must stand and eat their
next meal—this arouses the best in “rooting” spirit.

On Saturdayrnight, a caller with records and a demon-
strating group from Charleston volunteer their scrvices for
the evening. Starting with simple maneuvcrs that they havc
learned from folk dance classes, the campers end up with
more difficult ones. This is the night of the week when all
find time to comb their hair and “break out” their best in
camp-togs.

Wednesday brings the long awaited and anticipated ad-
venture—the overnight campout with the covered wagon.
A menu is planned that adequately meets the rigorously

220

 

scheduled diet needs. The campers pack bed rolls, flash lights
and jackets—their duffel is in t0p notch form. The older
boys aid the riding counselor in harnessing the horses and,
as the last buckle is snapped, Kno-Koma is a mass of bulging
eyes. Imaginations run wild when those diabetic children
see this covered wagon fully equipped—food hox on the
rear and the water barrel attached to the side—like that of
the west-trekking pioneers. As the water barrel 'is adjusted
and filled, the food is stored in the end box, the duffel is piled
aboard—the campout is on! The older campers climb
aboard the wagon with a nurse and a doctor and the rest pile
aboard a jeep and rustic trailer. As the entire unit—
doctors, nurses, cooks, dieticians, counselors, campers and
directors—slowly moves out of camp, the group breaks into
singing to the accompaniment of the plucking of ukuleles,
clanging of pans, and squeaking of wagon wheels. After
covering three miles of dirt road, up grade, down grade and
seventeen creek crossings, the contingent reaches the camp-
out area. Immediately the grOUp starts preparing for the
evening meal—evcryone gathers fire wood.

Instruction is given as to the use-of foil in cooking a meal
consisting of cheeseburgers and hotdogs with all “the I
works,” baked potato and pre-cooked baked beans, milk and
bread and t0pped with watermelon. Meals must hc on time— 4
they cannot vary from five to ten minutes, or reaction will
start; but hy carcful planning, this danger is eliminated, and
the campers can enjoy one of the best of camping activities,
cooking and eating the food themselves! The meal is fol-
lowed by a campfire, ending with story telling.

The proect of Kno-Koma has proved itself so worthwhile
for the diabetic handicapped that the state Diabetes Associa-
tion, Medical Association, Heart Association, and Associa-
tion of Crippled Children, with the help of Carbide and other
industries throughout the state, are projecting plans, for the
coming year, for the building of a permanent camp for all
medically handicapped children in the state of West Vir-l
ginia. The land already has been acquired.

The diabetic child was once considered handicapped—un-
able to play rigorously or enjoy normal functional activitiesl
of other children, but such is a fallacy now. As assured by

Kno-Koma, the diabetic can and does enjoy routine camp
activities.

 

“Every youngster should have an opportunity to
commune intimately with the out-of-doors. The sum-
mer camp should, therefore, not surrender to all the
comforts of the city. . . . Somewhere in between civi-
lization’s coddling and the rigours of pioneering lies
the outdoor experience, wth an apprOpriate share of
comforts but a genuine smack of nature and vital
living, which will provide an interesting and useful
chapter in anyone’s life. . . . It is at camps that
yougsters frequently have their best opportunity to
discover themselves. It is there they find their in-
terests and abilities, enjoy fruitful group experiences,
build up confidence in self and understanding of
pe0ple, and tingle with some of the deeper satisfac-
tions. It is not uncommon for them to acquire a fresh

and more vital outlook on life.”—-—G. OTT ROMNEY in
Of the Job Living, A. S. Barnes and Company, 1945.

PERSONNEL

lrnn-ltange Training Institute

UCH has been written and said
i“ about the need for c00peration
and coordination among agencies and
public departments for civic betterment and welfare services
within communities. From time to time we have also read
or heard of successful examples of such cooperation, but
rarely do we find instances of similar cooperation and co-
ordination between neighboring cities. Yet the need for this
is just as great. In general, cities seem to recognize this need,
although the time of city officials is usually consumed by
local problems.

In my field visits about Wisconsin, Illinois and Minne-
sota, I have found that two of the greatest needs of depart-
ments of parks and departments of public recreation are help
in finding qualified personnel to fill leadership assignments,
and help in training staff leaders. The department with an
operating budget under $50,000 presents the greatest need
for this service, since these communities usually hire only
one full-time year-round director who must assume full re-
sponsibility for the department’s services.

Although the following experiment could have been tried
in any one of the three states, and proven useful to “one-man
departments,” it was offered to communities on the Iron
Range in Northern Minnesota. The plan is not original.
However, the manner in which it was organized and the re-
sults obtained merit the consideration of department execu-
tives everywhere who have the same need for special assist-
ance with their leadership training problems.

After discovering the need and discussing the idea for a
training program with executives on the Iron Range, a fol-

 

low-up questionnaire was mailed to thirteen different com-
munities in January. This sought pertinent information re-
garding each individual community’s needs for leadership
training. Some of the major questions were:

trict representative of the National Recreation Association.

Robert Horney

1. Would a leadership training institute be helpful to you
and your staff?

2. If an institute is held, can we count on your participation
and acceptance of the proportionate share of the cost of
bringing a National Recreation Association specialist to the
Iron Range for a week’s leadership training program?

3. Please suggest questions to be discussed which will help
you with your major problems.

4. Suggest the community, most centrally located for the
institute, which would be most convenient for you and your
staff to attend.

5. Please indicate the dates of the institute best suited to you.

6. Could you attend a meeting in March to help plan the
details of the institute program?

By the early part of February the questionnaires had all
been returned. Tabulation showed that eight different com-
munities definitely wanted the institute and agreed to share
the cost of a specialist with the other participating communi-
ties. Three towns reported that they felt the institute would
help them, but official board approval for sharing the costs
pended the next regular board meeting. Two communities
indicated a desire for the service but stated funds were not
available until spring when tax allotments would be doled
out for the summer recreation program.

Representatives from all of the Iron Range recreation de-
partments Were invited to attend a planning meeting with
the district representative of the National Recreation Asso-
ciation, to be held in Virginia, Minnesota, in March. During
this three-day conference the following plans evolved:

1. Training institute to be held in Virginia, Minnesota,

June 9 through June 12.

2. Daily schedule of sessions set for 10:00 to 12:00 noon
and 1:00 to 3:30 P.M., with no evening work. (These hours
were selected by the executives to permit the directors and
staff sufficient traveling time to and from their respective

communities daily.) —)

' 221

3. The NRA representative was requested to have on hand
an abundance of reference and source material for the ex-
ecutives and their staff members to review during the week’s
session.

4. The training program to be open to all community lead-
ers, such as church Bible school leaders, Boy Scout and Girl
Scout leaders, day camp leaders, 4-H leaders, teachers, and
PTA representatives.

5. It was decided to have a one-day session for executives on
“Administrative Problems.” This would give an opportunity
to department heads to discuss the problems which do not
ordinarily confront subordinate staff personnel.

6. The Virginia Recreation Department to assume the re-
sponsibility for all local arrangements, handle local publi-
city and registration details.

7. Authorized the National Recreation Association to as-
sign one of its staff specialists to conduct the training insti-
tute.

8. Suggested the program content and program topics for
- the institute. -

Early in May each community was mailed a copy of the
final draft of the institute program, together with informa-
tion about the background of the NRA specialist assigned to
conduct the institute.

By 10:00 A.M. on June 9, the first morning of the Iron
Range Institute, the registration reached a total of sixty-two
leaders. This included executives and summer staff mem-
bers from twelve different communities. Before the regis-
tration was completed sixty-six different pe0ple had been
signed. This figure was far greater than the planning com-
mittee had anticipated. With one or two exceptions, the
executive of each community used his own car for transpor-
tation, and paid for the gas out of his own pocket, to trans-
port his staff daily to and from the training sessions. The
one-way mileage ranged from five to ninety-seven miles. The
communities participating included Biwabik, Gilbert, Ely,
Parkville, Virginia, Eveleth, Mountain Iron, Buhl, Chis-
holm, Hibbing, International Falls and Aurora, Minnesota.

At the closc of the first morning’s general session, the
group was divided: the executives met with the NRA field
representative, and staff members met with Miss Helen
Dauncey, NRA specialist from New York.

During the executives’ session, some of the problems dis-
cussed were:

1. How do you go about forming a citizen’s advisory
council?
. How do you develop school and city c00peration?
. Maintenance control and operation.
. Developing public relations.
The organization and financing of youth centers.
Promoting recreation programs for girls.
Programs for the golden-age group.
Playground work schedules, salary scales, number of
weeks of operation.
9. Budget preparation.
10. Trends in the recreation field.

During the week, the program for the staff personnel in-
cluded: leadership techniques;
grounds; problems of conduct.

Half of the week’s training sessions were devoted to the
active participation of the delegates in learning a wide vari-
ety of activities for their playground programs. Adequate
time was also set aside for the discussion of problems; and
individual interviews were scheduled for those making
special requests for help.

At the close of the institute, some of the results as listed
by the delegates were:

“By sharing the cost of specialized training with other
communities, the director and his staff felt they received a
valuable training at a very low cost.”

“Helped new leaders entering the field for the first time
to become aware of the real meaning of the profession.”

“Served as a refresher course for staff members who had
not been privileged to attend a professional training session
for years.”

“Offered new techniques of leadership and offered many
new program ideas.”

“Explained new trends in the recreation field as observed
by NRA representatives giving field service throughout the
United States.”

“Offered an opportunity for leaders to discuss their prob-
lems, compare their programs and exchange ideas.”

All of the delegates said their enthusiasm for their sum~
mer assignment had been increased through this experience.

A “follow-up” visit to the participating communities dur-
ing the summer by the NRA field representative found ex-
ecutives voluntarily testifying to the good effects of the
training program. Some of their comments were: “Our
playground program got off to a much better start this
year”; or “We had less fumbling of problems of conduct this
year”; “Our attendance doubled over last season at this
period”; “The attitude of the leaders is greatly improved
this summer”; “Our leaders are doing a better job of plan-
ning their daily schedules.”

As a result of the new reference material exhibited during
the institute, several departments increased their profes-
sional library, and others asked to be included 011 the Na-
tional Recreation Association mailing list.

News of the success of the institute spread to other vil-
lages and towns on the Range, and several asked to be in-
cluded in the planning for the 1954 institute. Other areas
of the state are making tentative plans for similar institutes
for 1954.

Last year’s experiment was not without flaws. Delegates
requested that a craft specialist be added to this year’s in-
stitute staff, and requested more time for the discussion of
administrative problems. So that more towns and villages
might become interested in the training program, it was sug-
gested that consideration be given to offering the institute
program at two different Iron Range localities this summer,
thus including more delegates and reducing travel time for
many of them.

Considering the possibility of inclement weather, the local
arrangements committee was asked to plan for indoor meet-
ing space, too; others asked for a certificate of attendance.
Better distribution of the institute program content was sug-
gested, and a summary of the institute program was favored
by most executives and their staffs.

RECREATION

     

IMPORTANT in the amazing and ex-
tremely worthwhile work of the
Cerebral Palsy Recreation Center in
San Francisco, is the philos0phy of the
sponsoring agency—the Carl Cherry
Foundation—and of Janet Pomeroy who is director of the
center. “The utilization of the creative ability or originality
of another person is the most effective means of helping him
to further his own growth and deveIOpment.” This is the
belief that forms the core of the center program. This, plus
the lack of opportunities for the cerebral palsied in the San
Francisco area, provided the initial incentive for the founda-
tion to Sponsor a creative group project for them.

The recreation center grew out of eXperience gained by
Janet Pomeroy as a volunteer worker with the cerebral pal-
sied in San Mateo since 1947. In her experimental work,
Miss Poniéroy saw the need for special adaptation of recrea-
tion activities for this group, and she undertook to develop
a program which included drama, pottery work, art, crafts,
games and special events. These activities were adapted to
encourage and allow participation of these persons regard-
less of individual handicaps; for example, one person who
could not use her hands was taught to work on the poltcr’s
wheel with her toes, and subsequently to hold a paint brush
and paint with her toes. Others, who had a spcech difficulty
such as occurs in so many cases of cerebral palsy, were en-
couraged to participate in a pantomime play, where no
speech was necessary; or they were encouraged to provide
a groan, or a grunt, as a sound effect for a radio skit. In
short, each individual was encouraged to find expression
through those parts of his body over which he had control.

In this manner, the activities provided an opportunity for
everyone to be included and to participate, and also proved
to be a valuable means whereby the cerebral palsied could
be stimulated and motivated to walk, to talk, or to otherwise

improve their physical coordination. Many children prac-
ticed for hours in order to coordinate their hands or arms
so that they could manipulate a puppet in a puppet show;
others willingly pr'acticed sentences or words in order to
receive an assigned role in a play or skit. Other activities,
in turn, were based on the same philosophy of providing an
incentive for the individual to improve himself through
creativc media.

Thus, the founding of the center, which represented a chal-
lenge to the foundation, provided an Opportunity for the
director to further prove that creative effort could be utilized
as a media to motivate individual and self-expression; to
deveIOp imagination and inspire original thinking; to instill
confidence; to assume responsibility; to learn by continued
investigation; and to create satisfaction and enjoyment for
an increasingly enriched, happy life.

The San Francisco Recreation and Park Dcpartmeht very
generously assisted the foundation by donating a portion of
the Fleishhacker Pool Building to the proect. The building,

which was originally built to accommodate a very sizeable

restaurant, proved to be most adaptable for this purpose.
The spacious main room, which once servcd as a dining
room, was ideal for large social gatherings and for folk danc-
ing in wheel chairs. Another room, overlooking the swim-
ming pool, made an exceptional clubroom and office. A very
large kitchen which was equipped ‘for restaurant cooking
provided many excellent facilities for activity programs. The
coolers, once used for hanging meat, made unusually fine
dark rooms for photography; while the old chopping block
lent itself to the pottery program for pounding clay. The
counters in the main room, once used for short orders such
as sandwiches and cold drinks, provided an ideal puppet.
stage.

The building itself is ideally located. It is across the
street from the ocean and directly above the swimming pool;

riding stables.

In addition, the San Francisco Recreation and Park De-
partmcnt undertook to act as consultants in technical mat-
ters concerning the program and administration. They also
installed necessary special equipment, such as ramps and
rails, and made available certain recreation areas, equipped
especially for the handicapped. They further providcd in-
structor-aides for deve10ping a swimming program at the
center.

Established professional rccreation personnel were en-
gaged to administer and conduct the program. In addition
to the director, a music instructor, art instructor, a matro'n
and a group of well qualified volunteers made up the staff.
The entire program was conducted with the backing and
guidance of\an advisory board made up of individuals con-
nected with other interested organizations.

Activities were started in November 1952, and were con-
ducted every Tucsday, Wednesday and Thursday. This
phase of the program was especially organized to include
those who, because of age (over eighteen), were no longer
eligible for special state education benefits, as well as those
who were not presently engaged in a full-time occupation or
directed activity, and those who were too handicapped to
work in a sheltered workshop. Six young people, whose ages
rangcd from nincteen to twenty-eight, attended this pro-
gram; transportation to and from the center was furnished
by the foundation.

The activities of this program—such as music, art, drama-
tics, photography, and potteryw—were adapted to inspire the
individual to participate as a member of the group. Within
this creative activity, a study club was originated to pursuc

APRIL 1954

subjects of interest to all. The group studied primitive man,
his activities as an individual, his social organization, his
relation to his environment and his creative achievements.
The group was encouraged to eXpress their understanding of
these studies in a composition, or a play, which they in turn
could prod uce themselves. In short, emphasis was placed on
creative self-expression, not only through activities, but in
addition by encouraging and providing the group with op-
portunities to participate with the staff in the over-all plan-
ning of the program.

Owing to the tremendous response and enthusiasm} shown
for the weekly program, and for the various special events
conducted at the center, a regular Saturday program was re-
quested, and subsequently established in Fcbruary, 1953.
This was particularly planned to include those young people
who were attending school, workshops, or other activities
during the week. Approximately forty-five young people
from the Bay Area and the Peninsula enrolled. Transporta-
tion was furnished by the American Red Cross, the founda-
tion, and the parents. The director and fouf trained recrea-
tion counselors made up the administrative staff; assistance
was provided by volunteers and matrons.

A student advisory council, composed of representatives
from the various age groups, acted as an advisory group to
the staff in planning weekly social group activities held at
the center and in nearby recreation areas. Puppetry, folk
dancing, creative writing, pottery, fishing, cookouts, swim-
ming, and horseback riding, adapted to include all handi-
caps, were the most p0pular events offered.

The center’s regular activities continued through July,
1953, at which time this program was recessed to a summer
day camp, which was conducted at the recreation center
during the month of August.

Program

In order to realize the tremendous response and enthusi-
asm shown toward activities developed by the center, and to
really “see” the complete participation of the young peOple
who attend, one should visit the center while a program is
in session. However, a partial substitute for such a visit is
provided by photographs. Those included here were taken
in the course of regular sessions, and depict some of the
actual activities of the participants at the center.

Members of the centcr’s advisory council, who discuss and
plan with the staff the activities of the program, are repre-
sentatives from the teen-age group and from the young-adult
group. These members were selected by their respectivc
groups.

Pottery making, one of the center’s most popular activi-

,1-

ties, is easily adapted to every participant, regardless of in-
dividual handicap. For example, if a person can control
only one thumb or finger, or press with the back of his hand,
he can still press clay into a mold to obtain the desired shape
and thereby create an attractive ash tray or bowl. Working
in c'ay has helped the young pe0plc immensely in the ma-
nipulation and coordination of their hands and feet. For
example, one girl was taught to work on the potters’ wheel
with her toes. Others have learned with practice to steady
their hands well enough to produce original picces made on

225

the potters’ wheel. Pottery is an excellent group endeavor.
In one instance, a girl who had not learned to steady her
hands well enough to work on the wheel turned the foot
pedal on the potters’ wheel for a girl whose legs were crippled

but who had use of her hands. Together they made a beauti- ‘

ful bowl, which was recognized as a mutual accomplishment.

dously important part that recreational activities play in the
total growth and development of an individual. Not only
have I realized this by seeing the desired results obtained
through application of these activities, but I have been made
particularly aware of differences in those individuals who
were denied recreational opportunities in early life. We all
recognize how, in play, children learn to adjust to a group, to
share, to take turns, and to have consideration for others.
Doctors, psychiatrists, and psycholOgists recognize this as a
very important segment of our total growth and develop-
ment, and we have come to take this for granted. However,
many of the cerebral palsied, who were born twenty or thirty
years ago, had no chance of belonging to a group as they
grew up. The chance to express their emotions, desires or
needs, which are identical to thosc of a physically normal

226

individual, was very slim. In addition, the Opportunity for
creative play acting, an instinct with which every child is
endowed, was further dampened by physical limitations, and
the normally afforded opportunities for learning were
absent. Opportunities for realizing achievement, which are
so important for gaining added self-confidence and a chance
to assume reSponsibility, were definitely lacking in the lives
of most of them.

“In view of these denials, however, the offering of recre-
ational Opportunities for handicapped is never too late and
never too soon. Recreational activities for the handicapped.
and particularly for the cerebral palsied individual, provide
motivations and incentives to walk better, to talk better, and
to participate in their own way, to their fullest capacity, re-
gardless of their limitations.

“From my experience it would appear that the benefits of
recreation and its importance to the individual can probably
best be demonstrated and proved in work with the handi-
capped.”

Important Factors

1) Time—To successfully administer a program for the
cerebral palsied, time must be considered as an important
factor. Activities must be adapted, slowed down. In speech
difficulties, time is needed for individuals to fully express
their thoughts. At the beginning of our program, three
young people, ages twenty-six to twenty-eight, said, “This
is the first time in our lives that anyone has taken the time
to hear us out—to hear what we have to say.”

2) Imagination—To create adaptations one must be able
to imagine, to alter, to improvise, in order to include the
variously handicapped individuals affected by cerebral
palsy, and devise ways and means to deve10p their latent
potentialities.

3) Patience—To allow cerebral palsied individuals to do
things for themselves, in their own way, requires a great
deal of patience. One may have the time, for example, to
permit an individual to walk very slowly on his crutches to
a,given area, rather than to wheel him in a chair; but it takes
patience to appear unhurried—to slow down, to wait for
him. One may also have the time to permit an individual to
speak in his own way, which is often very slowly and hesi-
tantly; however, it takes patience to keep from finishing a
sentence or a word for him, and instead, to try to under-
stand what he actually tries to say. Oftentimes, in order to
include a severely handicapped individual in an activity,
many trials are necessary, and much patience is needed to
make a suitable place for him, rather than to simply let him
look on. In short, it takes time, imagination, and patience,
to help these persons to help themselves.

It is the hope of the Carl Chcrry Foundation and Miss
Pomeroy that the center’s program will continue, and will
serve as a model, or act as a guide, in assisting other indi-
viduals or groups interested in developing a recreation pro-
gram for the cerebral palsied.

Future plans for the center: the development of a more
comprehensive program, which will include young cerebral
palsied children; to make available, generally, the accumn-
lated, adaptive materials developed by the director.

N INNOVATION in the game of basketball, recently
brought to the attention of ofiicials of institutions car-

ing for wheel-chair, bedridden and crutch-case patients, is
proving tremendously popular. This is called “ROI-Bad,“
basketball and—just as the names implies——the ball always
rolls back to the patient. A man, woman or child can enjoy
this activity. Participation offers recreational, mental and
physical therapeutic values:
1. Recreationally—Enjoyment and competition with other
patients in “foul shooting,” or in game of “21..”
2. Mentally—Tends to stimulate the patient mentally, inas-
much as any form of competition makes for alertness and
quick-thinking.
3. Physically—Tends to develop a patient’s shoulders, arms,
chest, wrists and lingers.

Patients participate, howevcr, only after getting permis-
sion of attending physician. The Roi-Bac basketball units
arc of three types:

1. Wall-Type Unit—Easily set up so that the wheel-chair
patient can wheel his chair to the unit, detach the net and
ball from the platform below the goal and bankboard, roll

back the length of the net, attach the net ends to the chair,
then begin to play either “foul shooting” or game of “21.”

MR. JAY ARCHER, also originator of Biddy Basketball, hopes
that his new garne, Rol-Bac, will bring to many bedridden,
wheel-chair and crutch cases, hours 0 I pleasure and en joytn ent.

This same procedure can be used in competition with other

2. Outdoor Playground Unit—This is set up by lowering
the bankboard to a height of six feet, then the net is applied
and extended to either a wheel-chair or a bench. ,J
3. Bed-Type U nit—This is easily attached to the foot of the
bed and can be set up so as not to interfere with the bedside
care of the patient.

Initial introduction of this game took place at the West
Side Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Colonel J.
A. Betterly, superintendent of the hospital, extolled it very
enthusiastically. He declared: “It gives me a great deal of
pleasure to report to you the results of our experience with
the Rol-Bac basketball set. The apparatus is easily attached
to the beds, and can be conveniently stored when not in use.
We have found that, where a patient may want to use it sev-
eral times a day, it may be left on the bed with the net folded
neatly around the basket and there will be no interference
with the normal bedside care of the patient. I believe the
apparatus has a definite thcrapeutic as well as a recreational
value and should certainly be of great assistance in the care
of our patients.”

The Roi-Bac basketball unit has been devised so as to
make the ball always return to the patient. This is pos-
sible because of the winged-shaped and trough-shaped net.
The unit is comprised of (1) a bankhead, (2) a standard
(for bed-type unit only), (‘3) a goal, (4) a basketball, and
(5) a net.

s WIMMING is a sport that is increas-

ing in popularity. To insure safety,
the bathing water must be kept in good
sanitary quality. For esthetic reasons,
it should be clean and free of suspended
matter such as algae. To meet these oh-
jectives, chemicals are added to the
water during the purification process.
Chlorine is used generally to keep the
pool water frce of bacteria. It is added
in such quantities that a portion is used
up immediately in the destruction of
organic matter and bacteria, and in the
oxidation of ammonia and other con-
stituents in the water. The amount left
is known as residual chlorinc
which is available to kill bacteria as
they are washed off the bathers’ bodies
and to destroy and to prevent the growth
of algae, provided the residual chlorinc
concentration is sufficiently high. Resi-
dual chlorinc occurs in one of two

OVBI‘

forms: free residual chlorine or com-
bined residual chlorine. Free residual
chlorine is a form of chlorine that can
act quickly upon bacteria and algac
and oxidize ammonia and other consti-
tuents in the water. Combined residual
(commonly called clilora-
mines) is a form of chlorine that is com-

ous organic compound, is slow to act
upon bacteria and algae, and has lim-
ited action to oxidize ammonia and
other constituents in the water.

The Joint Committee on Bathing
Places of the Conferencc of State Sani-
tary Engineers and the American Public
Heallh Association in its most rccent re-
port has recommendcd that the free
residual chlorine concentration be
maintained between 0.4 and 0.6 ppm
(parts per million) and the combined
residual chlorine level between 0.7 and
1.0 ppm with the desirability of main-
taining values up to 2.0 ppm. This re-
port also recommends that the pH of the

water be maintained between 7.0 and

7.5 as the .bactcricidal efficiency or rcsi-
dual clllorine decreases with an increase
of pH.

In out-of—doors swimming pools, frce
residual chlorine is destroyed by direct
sunlight, making it dichult to main-
tain the conccntration of residual chlo-
rine within the recommended limits.
Under normal circumstances, free rcsi-
dual chlorine values in excess of 0.6
ppm are irritating to the eyes of some
swimmers. Since combined residual
chlorine is morc stable in direct sunlight
lhan free residual chlorine, many out-
of-doors swimming pools use combined

chemicals containing ammonia. How-

many swimmers are in the water. Some
algae can grow in the presence of com-
hined residual chlorine.

The need for a method of chlorinat-
ing swimming pool water which will he
low in its bacterial density at all times
when in use. and non-irritating to the
cyes of swimmers, led to the develop-
ment of the high-free residual chlorina-
tion procedure. Basically, high-free
residual chlorination of swimming pool
water is the application of the principles
of breakpoint and super-chlorination of
public water supplies with modifica-
tions. It is the process of adding large
doses (SD—20.0 ppm) of chlorine or
hypochlorite to an alkaline water ( pH:
 to produce and maintain at
all times values of free residual chlor-
ine equal to or greater than 1.0 ppm.

Studies conducted at Yale University,
New Haven, Connecticut; Smith Col-
lege, Northampton, Massachusetts; and
Colt Park, Hartford, Connecticut, dem-
onstratcd that high-free residual chlor-
ination of swimming pool water renders
the water non-irritating to the eyes of
swimmers and practically free of bac-
teria at all times, even on bright sunny

days with many bathers in the water.
With this type of chlorination, the water
is clear and clean, sparkling bright and
light blue in color. Dull, cloudy, green
water in a swimming pool can be at-
tributed usually to suspended matter
such as algae and bacteria which inter-
fere with the passage of light through
the water.

Concentrations of free residual chlo-
rine up to and including 10.0 ppm are,
for all practical purposes, non-irritating
to swimmers’ eyes. This is attributed
to the rapid oxidation of ammonia-
nitrogen by the chlorine ions and pre-
vention of the formation of nitrogen-
trichloride and dichloramines by the
maintenance of a pH value hetween 8.0
and 8.9. Nitrogen-trichloride and di-
chloramines have been demonstrated as
being irritating to the eyes and to the
mucous membranes of the nose and
throat.

This procedure of chlorinating swim-
ming pool water does not require special
equipment or apparatus. However, it is
limited to swimming pools that recircu-
late and filter the water continuously
at a minimum rate of once every eight
hours; that have a good design of their
inlets and outlets which prevent “short
circuiting” of flow of water; that con-
tinuously apply chlorine and other
chemicals; and that use ammonia-free
chemicals. High-free residual chlorin-
ation can be accomplished with either
gaseous chlorine or hypochlorite solu-
tion. The chlorinating apparatus must
be capable of applying the chemical at
a high enough rate to satisfy the chlo-
rine demand and to produce the desired
free residlial chlorine level. If the point
of application of the chlorine he pre-
filtration, thorough mixing of the chlo-
rine solution is permitted. pH is con-
trolled by the use of soda ash or caustie
soda. While personal experience has
been limited to the use of soda ash, suc-
cessful reports have been received from
England of the use of caustic soda. Only
ammonia free alum may be used. Good

filtration has been reported when alum
is applied at the rate of 0.5 ppm (based
upon the pump capacity) for the twenty-
four-hour period immediately after
backwashing and 0.2 ppm at other
times. The alkali (soda ash or caustic
soda) and the coagulent (alum) should
be applied with chemical feed pumps or
other similar equipment to obtain uni-
form rates of application. Chemical so-
lution pots may not give good results.

No other chemicals are needed for
high-free residual chlorination. Quater-
nary ammonium compounds cannot be
used. In fact it is not necessary to use
any type of an algacide, as algae do not
grow in the presence of free residual
chlorine values that are experienced in
this treatment procedure.

High-free residual chlorination uses
more chemicals, but it produces savings
in operating costs in other ways. The
frequency of backwashing the filter is'
reduced. In the case of Colt Park Pool,
an outdoor pool, for example, the fre-
quency was reduced from once per day
to once per week. Vacuum cleaning the
pool is more efficient because the oper-
ator can see. the cleaning head more
clearly at all times. Life guards are en-
thusiastic about this method of water
treatment because of the high degree of
clarity of water produced. No longer do
they worry about a swimmer in trouble
in the deepcst part of the pool where he
may be concealed partially by the tur-
bidity of the water. Underwater swim-
mers enjoy swimming in water treated
with high-free residual chlorination.
The pool at Colt Park is 120 feet in
length and it is possible to see the op-
posite end of the pool when viewed
underwater.

High-free residual chlorination has
many advantages over other methods of
water treatment, but of principle im-
portance is the low bacterial density
that is maintained under all conditions,
and the reduction in the amount of irri-
tation of the eyes that some swimmers
experience.

ADMINISTRATIO

 

HIS SPRING the recreation commission in Oakland, Cali-

fornia (population 384,575) is opening another 50- by
100-foot 'municipal swimming pool—the fifth since 1948.
These, with the city’s 35- by 105-foot Dimond Pool con-
structed by the Lions Club in 1929 as “a gift to the children
of Oakland,” now provide that city with one pool for every
64,100 residents.

The new pool and bathhouse, located on the former bas-
ketball courts at Oakland High School, completes the build-
ing program authorized by the 1945 bond issue for pools
adjacent to five city high schools. ‘

In 1947, after a year’s study with board of education of-
ficials as to locations, uses and designs, an architect was
hired by the commission to draw plans for five nearly iden-
tical pools and bathhouses. It was mutually agreed that
pools standardized as to size and design would be more
desirable for instruction, inter-district and school competi-
tions, and general swimming purposes.

Construction of four pools started in 1948, beginning with
the Temescal and Fremont pools where sites were available
immediately. Those, with the Castlemont and deFremery
pools were completed before July of 1949. Release of criti-
cal matcrials for the fifth pool was authorized by NPA in
January of 1953 and construction started after June 1.

The Oakland pool cost approximately $143,000 including
the architect’s fee. The other pools with mechanical equip-
mcnt averaged $130,000. Any variance of these was the
result of soil conditions and different water tables. All pools
can be enclosed later if desired.

The Oakland, Temescal and Fremont pools are radiantly
heated while Castlemont and deFremery pools use heat ex-
changers. All are top and under-water lighted with turfed
areas beyond the concrete decks.

The Oakland pool has metal light reflectors rather than

glass, a metal diving board and one-piece welded ladders on
the walls. The eye bolts at the sides of the pool take care of
safety ropes at the four- and five-foot depths. The pool has
chlorinated rubber-base paint finish.

A cement-block wall acts as a windbreak at one side of the
pool deck and space on the other side will take portable
bleachers to accommodate some six hundred.

The one story bathhouse has two wings as dressing areas.
These oin at a central hall in which are located the cashier’s
stand and rows of racks for the new Sun Air plastic clothes
bags. Valuables can be readily placed in the floor safe. An
adjoining section will be used for first aid and as a dressing-
shower room for life guards. The bathhouse has been de-
signed to keep operating personnel needed at a minimum.

The three thousand square-foot bathhouse is of poured
concrete. Interior floors are of concrete, and room dividers
as well as shower and toilet partitions are of steel. Clear
glass is used only in the main entry door and in the behind-
the-counter door. Foot baths have been eliminated although
they are used at the other pools. Dressing rooms are heated
and have tiled wainscoting. Shower rooms, and hallways
too, are tiled.

To provide more ventilation, wire mesh rather than plate
glass is used at the filter-room openings. The sanitary
system has a vacuum type chlorinator, a pressure type and
filter, an eight-hour water circulation cycle and a chemical
feeder tank with water circulating through lump alum and
soda ash for a balanced system. The pool is equipped with
a modern re-circulation and skimmer system to eliminate
cxcessive use of make-up water for scum riddance.

A commendable agreement has been worked out between
the commission and the school board as to jurisdictions, poli-
cies, operation and maintenance of all pools. During the
June-through-September vacation, the commission operates
the pools in a three-way program—free “Learn to Swim”
classes for children and adults, a series of water shows,
pageants and exhibitions, and recreational swimming for

young and old. The public schools use the pools on wcek-
days during the academic year for physical education classes

and other school programs and furnish instructors, attend-
ants and equipment.

During 1952, more than a quartcr-million swims were
recorded at the five pools (four bond issue pools and
Dimond Pool) and 4,210 boys and girls had free swimming
instruction in the summer. It is
expected that 40,000 to 50,000
additional swims will be enjoyed
at the new Oakland pool during
the 1954 summer.

story on Oakland’s pools is the

A new refreshment stand, operated by the recreation de-
parment, at the Municipal Swimming Pool in Santa Rosa,
California, is expected to earn enough revenue to cut at least
a third of the operational costs paid each year from city

funds.

The stand serves a non-carbonated orange drink, “sno-
cones” (shaved ice flavored with fruit syrup and served in a
cone-shaped paper cup), hot dogs, candy bars, popcorn and
coffee. All drinks are served in paper cups as a sanitary pre-
caution, and to guard against danger of broken glass on the
premises. (Bottles of sun tan lotion are also excluded for
the same reason.) Use of paper cups also reduces operating
costs by eliminating dish washing.

Another new feature at the pool is the portable steel
bleacher, which accommodates approximately one hundred
spectators. Erected primarily for the comfort of mothers
who bring children to swimming classes, they may prove a
source of revenue by providing spectator accommodations
for water shows and swim mects.

The space for bleachers and refreshment stand was made
available by tearing down a number of lockers that were no
longer needcd after the introduction of a basket-checking
system for swimmers’ clothes. Swimmers now change clothes

that, with this system, half as many lockers accommodate
three times as many swimmers.

In the few months that the pool has been operating with
its recent innovations, comments, without exception, have
been favorable. Parents appreciate a seat—and refresh-
ments—while they wait. Swimmers and instructors appreci-
ate having a well-defined spectator area that frees walkways
around the rest of the pool for swimmer’s use only. And
pool personnel, who have responsibility for cleanliness, ap-
preciate having a confined area for wearing “street shoes”
and for eating.

p

The entire cost of the new spectator area, including con-
struction of a new wall, bleachers and refreshment stand
equipment, was $1,600. It is estimated that refreshment
stand returns will pay for this within a few months.

T here’s a new paint job, too. The pool has been painted
a pastel green in place of white (reducing glare) and the
formerly battleship-gray walls and locker area have been
changed to coral with green accents.

All in all, the Santa Rosa Recreation Department can take
great credit for using the pool to give much to many—and
for being alert to ways to improve its use and accommoda-
tions—while cutting the cost of city support.

Pet Service Project for April

At this time of year, spring house-
cleaning time faces every homemaker
with the annual headache of deciding
which winter clothes to keep and which
to throw away. Why not propose that
one of your community center groups-—
or perhaps all groups—remind her that
her family’s discarded clothing and
blankets are urgently needed by chil-
dren in other parts of the world? Write

to Harold Whitford, American Relief

Local stores,may be glad to cooperate
with you on this. Girls might model
their own spring clothes; or it could be
a culmination of their sewing or mil-

ing. The following songs might be sung
softly by a trio or duet: “A Pretty Girl
is Like a Melody”; “Easter Bonnet”;
“Alice Blue Gown”; “Girl of My
Dreams”; “Moonlight Serenade,” and
the like. _

For changes of pace, the style show-
ing could be interspersed with the per-
formance of songs and dances from oth-

costumes.

At Your Easter Party

The Easter bonnet theme can be car-
ried out in your parties, too. Set up
a table of “makings”——colored crepe
paper, cardboard, doilies, Howers, veg-
etables, scraps, feathers and other odds
and ends. Supply scissors, pins, paste,
and turn your guests loose—with a
time limit imposed upon their creative
endeavors. Let each one make her own
hat, or one for her partner. Provide
prizes for the funniest, most beautiful,
most original, most puzzling, and so on.

A STORY IN TWO PARTS

PART l—YOU and your COMMUNITY

by David M. Langkammer

Planning and organizing a recreation
program in any community is “every-
body’s business.” Seeking and securing
the c00peration and assistance of every
organization, agency, institution and
neighboorhood is the paramount re-
sponsibility of every public recreation
commission and its executive. Thus, the
Altoona Park and Recreation Board,
since its origin in 1949, has continued
to extend and enlarge the sc0pe of its
community recreation program, on the
basis of community c00peration. There-
fore, it is to be expected that Altoona
should have successful public recreat-
tion programs, particularly in drama
activities, art, athletics and music. We
shall show, here, the manner in which
our community music program got
started and how it became a cooperative
community enterprise.

MR. LANGKAMMER is superintendent of
recreation in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

APRIL 1954

Early in 1949, at the outset of Al-

toona’s public recreation program, the
park and recreation board called to-
gether the leaders of all of the local mu-
sic organizations, including the school
music supervisors, who had set up an
outstanding school instrumental pro-
gram, and the officers of Local 564 of
the American Federation of Musicians
who, too, were anxious to set up a co-
ordinated community program. The
outcome of this meeting, and others that
followed, was an expanded effort to in-
crease public intercst in community mu-
sic by combining all the music forces of
the city.

Ten outdoor band concerts, twelve
block dances and a daily community
sing program were the results of the
first summer’s efforts toward a planned
music program. Necessary finances to
cover the cost of instrumentation and
supervision were provided initially by
the local music union through the mu-

sic performance trust fund of the phono-
graph industry. (A first-hand story by
our local recording and trust fund di-
rector will conclude this article.) The
budget of the park and recreation board
now provides for payment of one-half of
the costs.

The close association established "at
the outset of the Altoona recreation pro-
gram in 1949 has continued and im-
proved each year. The scheduling of
music programs from the beginning was
done in such a way that each neighbor-
hood would have an opportunity to
share equally in the joy and pleasure
derived from outdoor concerts, dances
and community singing. This type of
scheduling has paid off splendidly, be-
cause more pe0ple in each neighbor-
hood became interested in the musical
opportunities provided in Altoona and
wanted to have more opportunity to en-
joy and participate in them. This re-
sponse encouraged the park and recrea'-

235

tion board to request additional funds
for community music programs. The
climax of our efforts came this past
summer when plans got underway to
conduct Altoona’s first outdoor sum-
1ner musical festival, scheduled at the
~Mansion Park Stadium on Wednesday
evening, August 5. The response was
most gratifying to the music committee,
as many local music groups volunteered
their help and support. It no longer be-
came a question of what should be on
the program, but rather to decide how
best to arrange the various numbers and
the placing of time limitations. The L0-
cal 564 of the American Federation of
Musicians went to work and got to-
gether the large instrumentation neces-
sary to supply the needed accompani-
ment for the various numbers and also
included a thirty-piece concert band to
start off the gala evening. An amateur
contest carried on at the various city
playgrounds created a great deal of ad-

our local television station joined to-
gether to carry every piece of publicity
we could-possibly turn out. In fact,
everything went well right up to dress
rehearsal, scheduled for August 4, the
night preceding the big event. It was to
be the only opportunity to rehearse the
six-hundred people participating in the
program and to check the numhers, tim-
ing, sound equipment and lighting. The
playground children had already re-
hearsed their part in the festival and
the adult groups were preparing their
costumes and make-up when it hap-
pened. Rain, rain and more rain tum-
bled on the festive scene at the Mansion
Park Stadium that night, wetting most
of the cast and certainly the enthusiasm
of the committee which, at this point,
had to decide “to go on with the show”
the following evening without the satis-
faction and assurance that could have
been derived from that all important
“dress rehearsal.” This discouraging
unexpectancy served only to increase
the enthusiasm of the participants and
interested public. Over 5,000 pe0ple
came to see “Under the Stars,” Al-
toona’s first summer musical festival.
To say that this first festival was all that
is to be desired, and that everything was
in “apple pie order,” would be ventur-

236

iug too far from the truth. The lack of

a dress rehearsal, coupled with the en-.

thusiastic response of a large audience,
accounted for unscheduled encores and
far too many overtimes. However, the
evening closed in the exuberance of thc
occasion as all joined their voices in

“God Bless America.”

We are all looking forward to this
year’s music festival with aigreat deal
of expectancy. Committee members are
now hoping to bring back to Altoona
several home town hoys and girls who
have hecome national figures in the
world of music, dancing and dramatics.

Every community can plan similar
programs, not only in music but in
every field of our national culture. The

trained and skilled entertainers in every
city are but waiting for your leadership.

So, get on the “bandwagon” in your
community.

PART II—YOU and your MUSICIANS LOCAL UNION

About four years ago the project di-
rector of Local 564 AFM, Altoona,
Pennsylvania, met with the superintend-
ent of the park and recreation board,
and as the result of that meeting the
ground work was laid for the first mu-
sical program for the summer activities
at the different playgrounds around the
city of Altoona. The burden of expense
for these first programs was borne by
the recording and trust fund of AFM,
and they consisted of block dances held
at different points in the city. After
studying the results of these first pro-
jects, the park and recreation board was
able to set aside funds in the next year’s
budget to help to defray the expenses of
them. There is now a working agree-
ment between the project director of
Local 564- and the park and recreation
board whereby, for each project that is
financed by the recording and trust
fund, the park and recreation board pays
for an equal project. Local 564 has been
very active in their use of the funds
which are made available to them by the
trust fund. They have supplied music
and entertainment to Cresson Sanitor-
ium, Cresson, Pennsylvania; Pennsyl-
vania state hospital for the mental; the
veterans’ hospital in Altoona; the Penn-
sylvania state institution at Hunting-
don; Girl Scouts; YMCA, and any
other worthwhile civic project which
the project director feels comes under
the ruling of the trust fund. This year

the program with the park and recrea-
tion board was expanded to include a
music festival at Mansion Park, which
proved to be a success and no doubt will
be repeated again this year. Any infor-
mation relative to the music perform-
ance trust fund can be obtained by con-
tacting the secretary of any musicians’
local in your vicinity. This is a nation-
wide fund, and with recreation coming
under the heading of civic projects,
there should be no trouble in obtaining
cooperation from any local.

Policies of the Trust Fund

1. In each community the opportun—
tics to contribute free music in the pub-
lic interest are different. The experi-
ence of the recording and transcription
fund of the AFM demonstrates that
no uniform rule can be imposed, and
that in each locality local conditions are
best understood by local residents.

2. It is clear that the American and
Canadian people appreciate the part
music can play in the lives of their com-
munities, whether as an educational in-
fluence, as a medium of entertainment,
or an integral part of public evcnts and
celebrations. All these are part of the
national culture.

3. While it is a fact that the incentive
for the trust agreements was the desire
to create employment for live musi-
cians, nevertheless, the emphasis must
at all times be on quality of perfor-
mance, on rendering a service to the
public, and on making a contribution
to the cause of music in all its forms as

 

a part of the national culture.

4.. Owing to the comparzltivcly small
sums available from the trust fund in
most of the defined areas, it 'is belicved
desirable in such instances that most of
the sum allocated be used in a few pro-
jects that will receive public recogni-
tion rather than being spread too thin.

5. Typical projects the trustee would
favor are performances at schools, hos-
pitals, parks, playgrounds, public cere-
monies and performances of music of
special artistic significance.

6. In all areas efforts should be made
to enlist the aid of co-sponsors, to ab-
sorb the incidental expenses of perform-
ances, and, where possible, to provide
at their cost additional or supplemental
performances beyond those provided by
the trust fund.

7. Special effort should be made to
interest a local newspaper as co-spon-

sor, wherever possible, in order to bene-
fit both the press and the public by in-

ticipating, practices the “bunny hop.”

creasing public knowledge of the contri-
butions made by the trust fund. In all
instances efforts should be made locally
to obtain fair mention from the press
for the trust fund and its projects.

8. Effort should be made wherever
possible to interest the municipal or
other local authorities as co-sponsors
for recreational, educational, commu-
nily or patriotic projects.

9. Effort should be made to obtain
cooperation from the local school au-
thorities for presenting music in the
schools in all areas where the school
music program can be so supplemented.

charged at any performance so ar-
ranged.

PART II—YOU and your MUSICIANS LOCAL UNION

About four years ago the project di-
rector of Local 564 AFM, Altoona,
Pennsylvania, met with the superintend-
ent of the park and recreation‘ board,
and as the result of that meeting the
ground work was laid for the first mu-
sical program for the summer activities
at the different playgrounds around the
city of Altoona. The burden of expense
for these first programs was borne by
thc recording and trust fund of AFM,
and they consisted of block dances held
at different points in the city. After
studying the results of these first pro-
jects, the park and recreation board was
able to set aside funds in the next year’s

I budget to help to defray the expenses of
them. There is now a working agree-
ment between the project director of
Local 564 and the park and recreation
board whereby, for each project that is
financed by the recording and trust
fund, the park and recreation board pays
for an equal project. Local 564 has been
very active in their use of the funds
which are made available to them by the
trust fund. They have supplied music
and entertainment to Cresson Sanitor-
ium, Crcsson, Pennsylvania; Pennsyl-
vania state hospital for the mental; the
veterans” hospital in Altoona; the Penn-
sylvania state institution at Hunting-
don; Girl Scouts; YMCA, and any
other worthwhile civic project which
the project director feels comes under
the ruling of the trust fund. This year

the program with the park and recrea-
tion board was expanded to include a
music festival at Mansion Park, which
proved to be a success and no doubt will
be repeated again this year. Any infor-
mation relative to the music perform-
ance trust fund can be obtained by con-
tacting the secretary of any musicians’
local in your vicinity. This is a nation-
wide fund, and with recreation coming
under the heading of civic projects,
there should be no trouble in obtaining
cooperation from any local.

Policies of the Trust Fund

1. In each community the Opportun-
ties to contribute free music in the pub-
lic interest are different. The experi-
ence of the recording and transcription
fund of the AFM demonstrates that
no uniform rule can be imposed, and
that in each locality local conditions are
best understood by local residents.

2. It is clear that the American and
Canadian people appreciate the part
music can play in the lives of their com-
munities, whether as an educational in-
fluence, as a medium of entertainment,
or an integral part of public events and
celebrations. All these are part of the
national culture.

3. While it is a fact that the incentive
for the trust agreements was the desire
to create employment for live musi-
cians, nevertheless, the emphasis must
at all times be on quality of perfor-
mance, on rendering a service to the
public, and on making a contribution
to the cause of music in all its forms as

a part of the national culture.

4-. Owing to the comparatively small
sums available from the trust fund in
most of the defined areas, it is believed
desirable in such instanccs that most of
the sum allocatcd be used in a few pro-
jccts that will reccive public recogni-
tion rather than being spread too thin.

5. Typical projects the trustee would
favor are performances at schools, hos-
pitals, parks, playgrounds, public cere-
monies and performances of music of
special artistic significance.

6. In all areas efforts should be made
to enlist the aid of co-sponsors, to ab-
sorb the incidental expenses of perform-
ances, and, where possible, to provide
at their cost additional or supplemental
performances beyond those provided by
the trust fund.

7. Special effort should be made to
interest a local newspaper as co-spon—
sor, wherever possible, in order to bene-
fit both the press and the public by in-

ticipating, practices the “bunny hop.”

creasing public knowledge of the contri-
butions made by the trust fund. In all
instances efforts should be made locally
to obtain fair mention from the press
for the trust fund and its projects.

8. Effort should be made wherever
possible to interest fhe municipal or
other local authorities as CO-SpODSOI‘S
for recreational, educational, commu-
nity or patriotic projects.

9. Effort should be made to obtain
cooperation from thc local school au-
thorities for presenting music in the
schools in all areas where the school
music program can be so supplemcnted.

10. No admission fees may be
charged at any performance so ar-
ranged.

SEVEN YEARS AGO this spring, the publicity department
and artcrafts section of the recreation department pro-

moted the first “Spring Hat Parade” to be held in the Chi-
cago Park District. Until that time, we had included hat
making as an incidental part of our artcrafts program but

we never really made it what one would call a big promo-
tional event. Mr. Heuchling, then the head of our publicity
department, had a great deal of enthusiasm and was simply
carried away with the idea, and I was equally enthusiastic.
I, therefore, certainly bit off more than I had any right to
chew.

That first year, seven artcrafts instructors took part, with
groups in fifteen parks. Mr. Heuchling solicited the interest
of the fashion editors of the city newspapers, and they all
agreed to take an active part in our plan. They formed the
Spring Hat Parade Committee along with a representative
of the fashion industries and of W arner Brothers Studios.
Special business stationery was printed with the names of
the members of the committee listed, and a breakfast meet-
ing to arrange plans was held toward the end of January. A
meeting of the instructors followed, and equipment—such as
hat blocks, hat streamers and special mirrors—was ordered
with caution. We really did not know how many women
would avail themselves of this phase of our artcrafts program.

The first meeting to which the public was invited was held
early in February in the Peoplc’s Gas Light and Coke Com-
pany’s large auditorium. This was purely a promotional
mecting; and wc chose this location because it was in the
center of the downtown shopping area and would be conveni-
ent for women from all over the city. At this meeting,
printed folders were distributcd on which were listed the
parks where millinery was taught. We had released a great

deal of publicity. The fashion editors were introduced, a]
exclusive hat designers talked and created hats on their ov
fashion models. We were amazed at the response. Tho
sands of women came. We hardly knew where to put the
and I was quaking in my shoes because suddenly I realizt
that I had to M.C. the program—and until that time, I h:
never had any M.C. training or experience. Somehow,
had not expected so many pcople, but we had such go:
speakers and the fashion editors added so much prestige th
I am sure it was a successful meeting. Soon afterwards, .'
of the park millinery classes became beehives of hat makin
and from then until the end of March, hundreds and hu
dreds of hats were made by neighborhood women.

Just before Easter that first year, two semi-final sho‘
were held. These were located as centrally as possible in t
Chicago Park District so as to best accommodate the grou
from the various parks. These events were competiti01

Publicity always seems to be better when there is com]
tition and when prizes are involved.

Tickets were distributed through the park milline
groups, for otherwise we would not have been able to contl
the crowds. At these semi-final parades, mention was ma
of the prizes to be given at the final parade—to be held jl
before Easter. ‘

The publicity was fabulous. One can accomplish so ma
things in a large city like Chicago where every possil
facility is at hand. Through the young woman from Warr
Brothers who was on our committee, we had pictures

ioved it all because it was the first event of its kind ever to
3e held and, consequently, it made good news. The dealers

in hat making materials of course, were eager to cooperate,

Ind even hat manufacturers donated hats for prizes, saying

:hat any cause which made women more hat conscious in-
lirectly brought business to them.

The final hat parade was held on the last day of March.
l‘ickets were also issued for this event. The fashion editors
1nd other members of the committee were the judges. The
irst prize was dinner for six at the famous Camellia House,
md then there were twenty-five other prizes donated by local
nerchants. Did you ever try to get eight women judges to
lgree on who should get twenty-five prizes? Well, don’t
ry it! “

The affair would have compared favorably with any big
:ity fashion show. Everyone was soft voiced and very, very
'ancy, and the hotel cooperated in every way by donating
heir beautiful Grand Ballroom and by contributing prizes.

Soon after this first Spring Hat Parade, I began to realize
.ome of our mistakcs. In the first place, I firmly believe now
hat we were defeating our purpose of recreation by includ-
ng competition with prizes. In the second place, in asking
be women to model their hats along a runway, we were un-
:onsciously excluding so many larger, older women who
bought they did not have clothes that were fashionable
'nough to apear before the public.

We know that women are interested in hats, especially
lfter the Christmas holidays and certainly when there is a
.oft, sunny day, even if it is a false indication of spring. A
'estlessness starts and there is a meaningful urge for some-
hing new and flattering. Women are tired of their darker,
lrabber hats and we feel that it is the psychological time to
tart our hat program.

Now, six years and a lot of experience later, we had twenty-
wo instructors and thirty parks representcd in our final hat

parade last spring. We started our program late in January
and continued our classes almost until Easter. Then each
park carrying on a millinery program had what we called a
local hat show, which was more like a large get-together or
party. The members of the classes brought coffee, cakes and
cookies and invited their friends. Every woman in the group
showed or modeled the hats she had made and the group
selected three hats to represent their park at the large city-
wide final hat parade. The classifications selected were:
The Low Cost Hat; The Entirely Made Over Hat; The Com-
pletely New Hat.

The final hat show is now scheduled after Easter at the
request of the women taking part in this program. It is held .
at a downtown hotel so as to be convenient to all parts of
the city. We print tickets and they are distributed through
the millinery groups. Of course, there is no charge for the
use of millinery equipment, for instruction, nor for attend-
ing the Spring Hat Parades. We merely have printed tickets
to remind the women of the date and the place and the time
—and we feel that they give a little advertising to the hotel.
Each hotel where we have held this event has given us the
best room and all of its facilities free of charge.

We designed and had made in our shops what we call a
hat screen. It is a large three-panel affair, the center panel
has three windows cut into it showing the models up to their
waist lines. This‘ does away with a certain amount of sclf— '
consciousness. Each window is marked with the classifica-
tion of the hat shown.

The windows are lighted with tubular lights so as to give

239

 

the most flattering light to the women’sfaces. Each instruc-
tor does the commentating for her own group of hats.

Prizes are now used as door prizes so that each woman
taking part has an equal chance of winning one.

Last spring, we showed ninety hats and had a guest speak-
er from Bonwit Teller who talked on fashion trends; and,
even with the choosing of the numbers for the door prizes,
our program took just under two hours—approximately
from two until four o’clock-in the afternoon.

The hotel, which was the Palmer House this year, pro-
vided its most elaborate room with a well-equipped dressing
room and an entrance vestibule for the newspaper reporters.
Next year, we will have the hotel serve fruit punch and
wafers. It will be our only expense and we feel that the event

warrants this comparatively small expenditure.

Last fall, we gave another in-training millinery institute
for our artcrafts instructors. They want to keep up with the
latest techniques and trends. We have never, to my knowl-
edge, had any feeling of competition from the department
stores. In fact, two department stores have put in large de-
partments of millinery materials and trimmings as a result
of our publicity.

We feel that this is one of the most successful parts of our
artcrafts program for women. As long as there are women
and changes in seasons and fashions, we will have hats and
as we say each spring to the women attending our Spring
Hat Parades: “Hold your head proudly erect in a hat that

. you have made.”

 

The best way in the world to keep pe0ple conscious of the
activities of a recreation department is by staging new and
different cvents just as often as possible.’ This is the belief
of John J. McGurk, superintendent of the department of rec-
reation in Salt Lake City. Last year, he came up with another
new and novel promotion as an Easter special.

The event was a mammoth Easter egg hunt at one of the
city parks. Before the event was completed, everybody in
Salt Lake City was made aware of this recreation department
activity and a large percentage of the families participated.

Mr. McGurk started by soliciting the help of Utah’s larg-
est egg-producing company, the Utah Poultry and Farmers
C00perative, an organization of 6,000 Utah farmers and
poultrymen. The co-op readily agreed to provide the eggs
and co-Sponsor the hunt.

The job of cooking and coloring the eggs provided a won-
derful participation program for the various boys’ and girls’
clubs of the city. Leaders of the six clubs were given as-
signments for boiling the eggs, coloring them and helping
direct the hunt for the younger children.

The hunt was restricted to children of ten years old and
younger, divided into four groups to give everyone a chance.
A “tiny-tot” area was set up for youngsters of four years and
° under. Another area was established for the five- and six-
year-old group; a third area'for boys and girls in the seven-
and eight-year-old range; and a fourth hunting area for the
nine- and ten-year-olds.

240

All boys and girls were assembled at the big bandstand al
Liberty Park for instructions, and while these instructions
were heing given out, the recreation department workers
and the leaders of the boys’ and girls’ clubs hid the eggs.
Motorcycle policemen helped to keep stray children from
wandering into the “hunt” areas. A dozen older boys and
girls were dressed in rabbit costumes to add a festive touch to
the occasion. A huge gong was sounded to open the search;
and more than 4,000 youngsters were in on the rush, while
hundreds of parents stood by to see the fun. Just to make
sure that none of the youngsters were disappointed, candy
Easter eggs were distributed.

The boys and girls, in each of the divisions, who found
the most eggs were rounded up by directors; and everyone
re-assembled at the bandstand. Here a fast-moving Eastel
program, arranged by Maxine Leigh, supervisor of girls'
activities for the city recreation department, was presented
and fifty winners of the hunt were awarded bunny dolls

Uncle Roscoe, Salt Lake City’s television character mos1
popular with the children, played an important part in the
success of the hunt.. He extended an invitation to the bum
over KSL-TV for a whole week, and then came out person
ally to draw pictures and entertain the children at the big
event. The Salt Lake City television stations, radio Stations
and newspapers also c00perated splendidly.

The tremendous success of the Easter Hunt convinceé
everyone that the event should be made an annual event.

sowing what others do before you make your own plans.
.ere’s the set-up in Miami:

.egistration and Enrollment
Birth certificates are required. Children enrolled must
:ach their fifth birthday by January first of the year follow-
lg their registration. All must he registered on registration
ay; and each class is limited to twenty-five children.
Mentally or physically handicapped children are not en-
)lled. These cases are referred to the supervisor’s office.

'ees and Hours

All working material, such as crayons, paper, paste, and
3 on, is furnished but each child must bring a small chair.
School hours are from 9:30 AM. to 12:15 P.M. Parents
re asked not to hring or send their children before 9:15
.M.; and all children must leave playground by 12:30 P.M.
_P'ublic school holidays are followed. If for any other
sason school will be closed, notes are sent home to parents
1 advance.

During inclement weather (rain or cold) schedule is post-
oned to the following day.
i The daily attendance of a child is important. If he is

absent from school more than five days, and the sopcrvisor
has not been notified as to the reason, he is dropped. It is
requested that the playground supervisor be notified if a
child has mumps, measles, or any other illness.

Lunehes and Transportation

Recess is between 10:30 and 11:00 A.M. The children
bring their own lunches, plainly marked on the outside,
which contain cookies, or fruit (prepared so they may eat it
without the assistance of the teacher), or a sandwich—but
no liquids, candy, chocolate covered cookies.

No transportation to and from school is furnished by the
recreation division; and the city assumes no responsibility
for transportation arrangements made by parents.

Parties

Birthday refreshments may be scrved by parents who
wish to make arrangements with the playground supervisor;
however, no birthday gifts may be brought to these parties.

the annual Easter party for

is always a good idea to vary a

re its popularity. About two years
we decided to do a little more than
dye eggs and hunt them. We
:ght it might be fun to dress them
-and so it was done! Several weeks
rc the party we began saving small
of pretty materials, such as ribbon,
. velvet, old flowers, pieces of veil-
brightly colored beads and buttons,
le tops, acorns and many other arti-
too numerous to mention. Before
guests arrived, we placed tables in

After the fancy eggs were completed,
the guests began to dye the remaining
eggs. We noticed one little man, a re-
tired physician, off by himself and still
quite busy. 0n checking as to why he
wasn’t dyeing any eggs, he told us that
he could dye eggs at home any time but
he couldn’t always have this kind of fun.
And‘ then we saw his masterpieces—six
pure white eggs with not a trace of
color, only black eyes and eyebrows and
little tufts of yarn on the sharper end for
hair. Buttons, acorns and coca-cola tops
adorned the heads for hats. To us they
looked rather anemic with no bright
color, but he was simply delighted.

The biggest thrill came when one lit-
tle old lady who never joined in any-
thing because, as she always told us,
“she’d had no learning” won first prize
for the most attractive egg. After mut-
tering to herself and protesting quite a
bit, she had painstakingly worked all
through the party to finally achieve her
success.

This activity was so much fun that
guests asked if we would do the same
thing again, and started making plans
for the things they would bring from
home to use next time.

As a happy ending, each member was
given a nice basket by the recreation
department, and the hunt began. Some
of these baskcts were taken by the mem-
bers to their grandchildren, some to
friends who were shut-ins, some to chil-
dren who might not be fortunate enough
to have a basket on Easter, and some
were kept as souvenirs of “one of the
best times we’ve ever had.”-—MRS.
VIOLA B. SHEFFIELD, center director.

Cooperative Easter Egg Hunt

Our city of Charlottesville, Virginia,
can be justly proud when egg rolling
time comes around. It is an affair that
is not only of interest to the recreation
department but to everyone in the city.

This project was started four years
ago, sponsored by the WCHV broad-
casting station and the Peoples National
Bank. The hunt takes place the Satur-
day before Easter at Washington Park
each year. The WCHV staff and the rec-
reation staff hide the eggs. Some eggs
are numbered; and every child finding
one receives a prize.

The prizes for 1953 were as follows:
a cake from Cleason’s Bakery; a toy
rabbit from Wiley-Tilman Incorpor-
ated; a baseball from the Downton Ath-
letc Store; twen'ty free passes from the
Paramount Theatre; twenty certificates
for comic books from the City News
Store; one certificate for a pair of shoes
from Waddell’s Shoe Store; and a cer-
tificate for a book from the New Do-
minion Book Sh0p; also, savings ac-

counts from the Peoples National Bank,
one for $20.00, one for $10.00, three

for $5.00, and six for $2.50.

Attendance at this affair is enormous.
ranging from eight hundred to one
thousand persons. Adults.as well as chil-
dren enter into its jovial spirit and help
to make it a grand success. The hunt
starts at two in the afternoon and con-
tinues until dark.

It is a wonderful idea and a fine
worthwhile job when the pe0ple in a
community—businessmen, profession-
als, laymen, housewives and children——
make Easter egg hunting a cooperative
frolic enjoyed by all—MISS FREDINA

TIIE DAY AFTER I got back from the
National Safety Congress, the plant
protection chief came to my office and
brought the chief of our city police with
him. They both looked worried.

The city man said, “This is going to
be a tough season, unless we get smart.”

I asked him what he meant. “The
kids,” he said. “I’ve been on the force
here twenty years and I’ve seen ’em in
good and bad years. This is going to
be a bad one. The Halloween vandalism
is starting early, and it’s nastier than
usual. There have been’lsome hoses and
bike tires slashed. Three false fire
alarms last week. And some of the win-
dow decorating isn’t soap, but paint,
and some of it’s obscene.”

Our plant chief nodded. “We’ve
caught some of it on the West shop
where it fronts on Elm Avenue. And
the barbed wire on top of the yard fence
has been cut. We don’t know whether
the kids stole anything but they got over
Wednesday night and must have done
some prowling around.”

I saw, then, why I figured in the pic-
ture. I’ve always drummed into the
heads of the men on the protection
force the idea that a kid trespasser was
a potential accident and that for their
protection as well as our own we had to
keep them off the property. Especially
off the yard, where the piled material
is a hazard, and where the railroad
tracks are within a few steps walk.

This story, although fiction, could actually become a true

I turned to the city police chief,
“Have you any ideas about what we can

do?”

He looked worried. “Not any that I
think are very good. I’ve been making

school, trying to do some missionary
work. The kids who’ll listen to me prob-
ably aren’t the troublemakers, and
those I had trouble with before just
don’t pay any attention except to laugh
at me after I leave. The service clubs
are figuring on their annual parties on
Halloween, but they don’t stop this ear-
ly stuff.”

I said I’d see what I could do, and
we left it at that.

' A couple of nights later we had my
assistant, Harry Dexter, and his wife
to dinner. Sue mentioned that some
paint had been smeared on a neighbor’s

’ porch the night before. That brought

up the whole problem and we talked
about it.

Suddenly, Harry said, “I’ve got a
hunch.”

“What?” I asked.

“Remember, I made a speech at the
high school about fire prevention in
October. There was a kid there, John-
ny Last, he’s something on the student
council. Anyway, after the meeting he
buttonholed me. He’s planning on an
engineering education, and he pumped
me pretty hard about the possibilities
in safety work. There might be an angle

there.”
So, the,next day, Harry and I went up

to see the high school principal. He,
was disturbed about the vandalism,
he wasn’t sure how he could help
I told him we wanted to try a const:
tive, not a punitive approach, and as
whether we could get Johnny Last
leased from classes 'that afternoor
come to the plant. I asked the pri
pal to say nothing about the vandali
and he agreed. “But I doubt if Joh1
will be much help. He’s not the t
to get mixed up in this sort of thi
and he isn’t any tattletale, either.”

That afternoon, when Johnny cam

around and showed him how we wc
The yard was part of the tour, and, 1

When they got back to my ofiict

some intelligent questions, and the t
went well.

As gently as I could I brought up

ting hurt or getting into trouble?”

“No, not even for that. Look, I don’t
pretend to be a bright guy who knows
all the answers, but I read a book once
in a while. You don’t stop this kind of
thing with a lecture. There’s something
back of it and you have to know what.
And you have to do something about it.
The police can threaten, and the princi-
pal can jaw, and maybe even the student
council can pass a resolution, and so
what. The little minority of trouble-
makers just get a kick out of knowing
they’ve stirred up a stink, and they go
right on with it.”

“So, what can we do to find out
what’s back of it?” I asked.

Johnny had an answer to that one.
“We need a youth center in this town.
A good one. Not just a hole in the wall
with a coke machine and a juke box.
But a place the gang can run—with
books, and maybe a hobby shop, and a
projector. We’ve been trying to get this
town to give the kids a better hangout
for a long time—better than the pool
room and Mike’s filling station.”

“Mike’s?.” Iasked.

Johnny was a little flustered. “Oh, I
just said that. Some of the hot-rodders
hang around there. Forget it.”

After Johnny left, I called our truck
maintenance chief. Yes, he’d missed
some parts. Nothing much, but some
tools and spark plugs and the like, stuff
that had been around a repair job in
the yard the last week.

So, from then on, Harry started buy-
ing his gas at Mike’s. The place was a
hot-rod hangout, all right. Afternoons
and early evenings, the kids were
around talking motors and girls and so
forth.

I rather suspect that the Jackson-
Barnes Corporation safety department
is the first such department to buy a
hot-rod racing car. W’ e did, even though
the requisition caused some eyebrow
raising in the plant. Harry bought it for
fifty dollars from a kid at Mike’s. It
was a purple and yellow, fenderless job
with a motor that was supposed to be
souped up, but which had developed
lumbago of the generator complicated
by tuberculosis of the carburetor. The
brakes were out of whack, and a sud-
den stop produced most 'remarkable

skids.
Harry brought it back to Mike’s 3

APRIL 1954

couple of times, and Mlke and the kids
held solemn consultation over it. Their
conclusion was that Harry had bought
a lemon and was just stuck.

Then Harry told them he worked at
the plant, and maybe our maintenance
department could help. He called the
plant and by a strange (and carefully
pre-arranged) coincidence, our truck-
maintenance chief was there. So a pro-
cession of jalopies went to the plant
gate, was admitted on Harry’s say-so,
and drove to the yard. There was, I
learned later, no vandalism in town that
evening. The reason is clear enough.
From 7:30 to 11:00 that night, the wild-
est bunch of crazy teen-agers in town
were watching in awe and admiration
as three first-class mechanics did things
to Harry’s hot-rod——-and to a couple of
others——-that had the kids’ eyes popping.

And before the night was over, we
had an agreement from the city police
to let us use the fairgrounds for time
trials the next afternoon.

A couple of days later, Mike greeted
the kids with these words, “Hey, you
mugs. Look! Here’s a couple of-beat-
up salesmen’s cars that that mechanic
down at J ackson-Barnes said you guys
could raid for parts. And Harry’s goin’
to auction off that job of his tonight,
with the proceeds going to pay eXpenses
for a big day of time trials at the fair
grounds November 1-. How about that?”

I had figured it might be necessary
to make a speech at a high school as-

sembly warning the kids, but it wasn’t.
Three days before Halloween a delega-
tion of the hot-rodders called on Harry
and handed him a package. “We just
found out some of our guys got out of
hand a few weeks ago, and got over
your fence and swiped this stuff. We
didn’t know you guys then, an’ you
know how it is. We—that is they fig-
ured a big outfit like Jackson-Barnes
could spare some things for some kids
who are broke. We see it different now. '
Here’s the stuff—all of it we could get
back.”

And yesterday, at the time trials,
Johnny Last was the official starter.
During a lull, he turned to me and said,
“Guess I figured wrong. I thought we
needed a youth center, but you had a
better answer.”

I looked at him. “Johnny, you had
the right answer, or part of it. But it
couldn’t do the job quickly enough for -
this year. You go ahead, and I think
you can count on J ackson-Barnes for a
good contribution. But for the quick
job, it was Mike’s or nothing. You gave
us that tip, and we’re grateful.”

“I didn’t mean to give it to you,” he
said. “I didn’t want to cause any trou-

ble.”

“You didn’t,” I said.

He thought a minute. “So this is
safety engineering,” he said.

I grinned at him and replied, “This,
and practically anything else under the

sun.”

—IN THE ONE-MAN RECREATION DEPARTMENT

7HROUGH RECREATION literature, I was
aware that there were children’s gar-
dens under the supervision of recreation
departments. Knowledge of how much work
they might involve came, however, from past
experience when, as a boy, I had to tend
one. Since this is a one-_man department,
most of the supervision and work was going to be done by
volunteers. Our city of 13,000 in eastern Oregon is sur-
rounded by huge ranches of from 500 to 30,000 acres, and
water is a prime concern to every rancher, as well as to
the city.

Initial preparation was to obtain any available, close-in
land. One interested individual donated a vacant lot of about
one acre and offered to supervise the children there.

After the investigation of possible garden sites I had the
choice of six plots of land; and, because of the water problem
and location, I took two of those for our initial children’s
garden project. ‘
Organization. All children from junior high school age
down, including the fifth grade and some very interested
fourth graders, were told in the schools, during the month
of April, that they could have a garden plot—provided that,
(and this was stressed) : (1) they attend enough times
throughout the summer to do all necessary work; (2) they
were not afraid of work; and (3) that their parents would
sign a form sheet that made the parents and children ointly
responsible and aware of the tasks involved. Each child who
showed an interest was given this application to be signed by
the parent; and eventually seventy-five children were alloted
plots approximately twenty by forty feet. Some of the larger
boys, who belonged to the Future Farmers of America, each
received about four of these plots. There were no prizes to be
awarded; however, children were reminded that they could
enter specimens in the county fair to be held in August; and
that one of the rewards of gardeners is the providing of food
for their own tables.

A firm (Smith Canning and Freezing Company) had
three and a half acres which, in previous years, had been
used by the Mormon church in their relief projects. Waste
water from the cannery could be diverted to the irrigation
of this plot. (By use of waste water only, this project could

be accomplished here.) The plot was prepared by the Pen
dleton Grain Growers (a co-op) with their machinery, ant
prisoner labor (which I use quite extensively). The city en
gineer, Archie French, and an irrigation expert, Olive
Sykes, laid out the watering system and the city street de

‘partment did the necessary leveling and ditching.

The Pendleton Garden Club agreed to supervise the indi
viduals; although each parent was also impressed with thi
responsibility and the club’s supervision was in the genera
techniques. Three supervisors were assigned to the three
and-a-half—acre plot and one supervisor to the one-acre plol
These were all volunteers. Mrs. James Smith supervised thi
one-acre plot which she had donated. On this, the childre1
and parents spaded and prepared their own seed beds. Wate
came from another neighbor’s water system and the extr:
cost on his water bill was assumed by the city recreatio:
department. Supervisors for the larger plot were Mrs. Rober
Jennings (housewife), Mr. Marr Waddoups (research as
sistant at the Experimental Station), and Dr. Charles Rohdi
(assistant agronomist at the Experimental Station). Eacl
of these volunteers made himself available one evening eacl
week to answer questions and give advice.

The individual child was allowed to plant any vegetable o
flower of his choice. Prior to the allotment of individua
plots, a planting chart was sent through the mail to eacl
child. These were obtained through the 4-H representativ:
of the county and contained all the planting, growing an:
harvesting information necessary for a garden. The indi
vidual was encouraged to work whenever he had the time.

From all appearances, every imaginable vegetable and :
number of flowers have been planted. The young gardener:
have had radishes, onions, peas, and spinach from thei:
plantings. Corn, potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, beans, beets
carrots, lettuce, cucumbers and, of course, watermelons haw
also been planted.

Cultivation of these gardens is a problem with some in
dividuals, and in a few instances there are vacant patches
although I don’t think vacant is quite correct, because tht

RECREATIOI‘

 

arger plot is plagued with millions of weeds. A number of .

he gardens could easily be considered model gardens as for
rariety of planting and general appearance. Cultivation is
lone by the children with some help from their parents.
3arden plots not pr0perly cared for by the children were
given to other children first, and then to adults who in most
:ases have put in potatoes or late corn. To encourage the
:hildren to take care of their garden, name stakes were put
n each plot. t
Costs on this project have been divided as follows:

Land—donated
Seeds—furnished by the individual
Water—furnished by the city and waste canning water

 

Fertilizer—furnished by a rancher

Cultivation and preparation—furnished by Pendleton
Grain Growers and the parks and recreation department

Supervision—volunteers, and parks and recreation de-
partment

Irrigation and watering—irrigation times are announced
in the paper and many dads, children and shovels appear to
get water through the rows. Supervised by parks and rec-
reation department.

Some of the things to be considered for next year are:
(1) screening the applicants more closely for their ability
to do a good job; (‘2) possibly making the plots a bit
smaller; (3) having a list of familics or older people who
could take over a garden plot if and when a child fails to
care for it; (4) turning the ground over to eliminate some
of the weeds.

There have been many more individuals, firms and groups
who have offered land, labor, machinery and know-how for
this project. For the first year I wanted to keep the number
of areas, participants, and problems to a workable amount.
Then, too, the problem of water may limit future expansion
to some extent.

As a general rule, the community has accepted the project
and given every assistance that has been necessary. And
when next season comes, more know-how on my part will
make this a more rewarding experience for those who par-
ticipate.

Southern Regional Study

Inquiries regarding the status of the
Southern Regional Recreation Study of
leadership and training needs are in-
creasing and I want to take this oppor-
tunity to make a very brief progress re-
port. Meetings of the study committee
have been held in Atlanta, Georgia,
Lexington, Kentucky, and Chapel Hill,
North Carolina. The study itself is
rapidly coming to a close, and at the
recent two-day meeting of the commit-
tee plans were made for the publication
and implementation of the report.

The final volume will be reduced to
about 250 pages and is expected to be
published in book form by a southern
university press. A tentative date has
been set for a large conference in the
fall for the purpose of (1) presenting
the problem and a report of the find-
ings, and (2) determining a profes-
sional graduate education program.
The conference will be held in Atlanta,
Georgia, and college presidents and
deans will be invited, together with rec-

reation educators and representatives.

from the various public and private rec-
reation areas of service covered in the
study. The opportunities for action
leading to the improvement of the rec-
reation profession in the south are be-
coming increasingly exciting as the
needs, gaps and problems are identified

and analyzed.

MEAEKKE‘E’ NEW§

Storage and Carrying Trucks

The Monroe Company, 181 Church
Street, Colfax, Iowa, has announced
the introduction of a new line of trucks
for carrying folding tables and chairs.
The trucks, termed the “Transport-
Storage” series, are of electrically
welded, all-steel construction. Equipped
with four swivel castors, they may be
moved in any direction and may be
turned in a circle only slightly greater
than the length of the truck. By using
these trucks, folding tables and chairs

 

may be stored under stages and in other
small spaces. Write to the company, at
the address given above, requesting
their latest catalog on these and other
items. '

Sports Lighting Bulletins

A new seven-page bulletin on sports
lighting has been announced as avail-
able from the General Electric Com-
pany, Schenectady 5, New York. Desig-
nated GEA-6067, the new bulletin pic-
tures well-planned lighting in football,
golf, baseball, basketball and other
sports; and the numerous benths of
night sports are outlined.

The company also offers a manualu—
Bulletin GET-1284—of complete flood-
lighting plays designed to assist a com-
munity or organization to set up sports
lighting facilities.

Projection Room Fire Shutters

The Best Devices Company, Inc.,
10921 Briggs Road, Cleveland 11, Ohio,
announces a new line of porthole fire
shutters for both indoor and outdoor
movie projection rooms. These fire
shutters prevent the spread of smokc
and fire destruction starting in the pro-
jection room.

Best Porthole Fire Shutters meet all
state and city inspection laws where
gravity doors or shutters are required
for projection room opcration in pub-
lic buildings, auditoriums, and so on.

252

Four types—for the picture port, the
picture and stereOpticon port, the ob-
servation port, and the spotlight port—
are available.

Each shutter consists of a frame that
provides a quick “over-port” wall
mounting installation. The synchron-
ized, simultaneous closing of all the fire
shutters in the projection room is
achieved with the control bar which is
semi-automatic in operation. Action oc-
curs at the flick of the emergency re-
lease. When projection room tempera-
ture reaches 160° the fuse lengths part,
causing the automatic release of the fire
shutter.

Marking Device

A new marking device, called the
Magic Marker, writes with a felt nib,
makes lines of varied widths from pen-
stroke to brush-stroke size, and comes
in the six primary colors plus black,
brown and white. Usuable on any sur-
face—porous and non-porousu—it is
ideal for marking and labeling wood,
fabrics, paper, composition board,
leather, plastics, metals, asbestos, glass,
rubber, films and ceramics; and its
markings are completely wearproof and
waterproof. The ink dries as fast as you
write and is impervious to heat and

 

cold. Speedry Products, Inc., 91-31
121st Street, Richmond Hill 18, New
York, manufactures this product which
will prove a boon for marking various
recreation equipment.

Terminals for Model Railroads

Model railroaders, hobbyists, and
craftsmen who need to make better wire
connections and quicker contacts on
terminals, should be interested in the
Nu-Way Snap Terminals. These have
been adapted to fasten wires to the
transformer posts and to several term-
inals on top of- each other for multiple
connections. Others can be added or

1e Conservation Yearbook 1953

Edited by Erle Kaufiman. The Con-
rvation Yearbook, 1740 K Street,

.W., Washington 6, D. C. Pp. 320. ‘

.50.

This second and enlarged edition of
ie Conservation Yearbook contains a
alth of up-to-date facts and figures
ating to all phases of conservation—-
i1 and water, forests and forest prod-
ts, wildlife and fisheries, the range
nds, parks and the wilderness. It in-
des a directory of more than five
ndred conservation organizations, a
.t of the nation’s three thousand soil
mservation districts with essential
rts about each, and the names of more
n five hundred legislators, planners,
iters and other key persons related to
e field of conservation. One section
devoted to a full roster of the national
rks with a brief description of each
1d the names of the operating person-
1; also similar information with ref-
ence to wildlife refuges, wilderness
teas, state parks and state forests.
This publication, which represents an
usual degree of cooperation on the
rt of a large number of officials and

tizens, affords a valuable reference
urce.

low to Help the Shut-in Child

Margery D. McMullin. E. P. Dutton
(1 Company, Incorporated, New York
. Pp. 192. $2.75.

Here is a simple, informal listing of
3 tested suggestions for helping and
couraging the permanently bedrid-
n or homehound child. The ideas are
ll-organized under chapter classifica-
ns, such as: Life in Bed (ways to
ake the child co‘mfortable and happy) ;
ys and Playthings; Gifts a Child Can
ake; Shopping Hints; Hohhies and
cupations; and so on.

While written primarily for and
out children, many of the suggestions

Guide to the Appalachian Trail
in Maine

The Appalachian Trail Conference,

1916 Sunderland Place, N.W., Wash-
ington 6, D. C. Pp. 450. $2.50.

This, the fifth edition of. one of the

fascinating Appalachian Trail guides,
is not merely the fourth edition brought
up to date, for many sections have been
completely re-written. It contains a
complete description of the 269 miles
of the trail in Maine, including eight
detailed maps, and: Part I, General In-
formation; Part III, The Appalachian
Trail and Side Trails; Part IV, General
Articles. The Katandin Section (Part
II) is issued in a separate volume
(1952; 228 pp., 2 maps, $1.25). This
edition lists the lean-tos and campsites
along the trail, outlines camping regu-
lations, and all other necessary infor-
mation. In the new loose-leaf format,
sections and maps can be conveniently
removed as required for use. It is sug-
gested that, for their protection, an espe-
cially prepared waterproof, transparent
map case be carried. (These are avail-
able for 3.85 postpaid, from The Maine
Appalachian Trail Club, Augusta,
Maine.) This volume also has much to
offer to the armchair traveler.

The OHicial Li’l Abner Square

Dance Handbook

Fred Leifer. National Dance Club of
America, 1583 East 98th Street, Brook-
lyn 36, New York. Pp. 122. $.35.

Steps, calls, games, music and some
profit-making ideas for callers have
been gathered together and published in
this paper covered, pocket-size book-

let. In collecting and presenting this
material, the author has done two good
things. He has put together a variety of
simple dances—well explained, in an in-
expensive edition; and he has included
easy arrangements of the tunes to be
used. Also they are well illustrated. He
has, however, gone overboard in giving
them a popular slant, and has sacrificed
in so doing.

The smoothness and beauty of pat-
tern in square dancing have not been
sufficiently emphasized. Unfortunately,
too, the poor quality of paper used in
the publication gives it an unnecessarily
cheap look. However, as we all know,
you “can’t judge a book by its cover.”

Care and Breeding of Budgies

Cyril H. Rogers. Dover Publications,
Incorporated, New York 19. Pp. 93.
Cloth $1.75; paper $.65.

If you want to start an aviary, or go
into the breeding of shell parrakeets in
a smaller way, this new booklet is filled
with helpful information. Almost all
advice centers about breeding proceed-
ures and descriptions of coloring vari-
ations of this type of bird. Only a few
pages at the end are devoted to such
matters as ailments and their treatment,
training and exhibiting. Lists of refer-
ences and of sources of supply are
given; and it is interesting to learn that
there are a number of Budgerigar socie-
ties, including state organizations in
New Jersey, Massachusetts and Michi-
gan.

New Games for ’Tween-Agers

Allan A. Macfarlan. Association
Press, New York 7. Pp. 181. $3.00.

Allan Marfarlan has managed a fresh
and new collection of novel games in
this book, through the inclusion of se-
lections from various,countries of the
world, the adapting of old favorites, and
the addition of originals invented by
himself. In fact, the first chapter deals
with “The Art of Directing, Adapting,
and Inventing Games.” The material,
directed to leaders, parents, counselors,
is classified according to age groups to
show the greatest general appeal of each
game. All games have been tested and

approved; and they are unique in that ' '

almost all of them can be played by
boys and girls together. Most of them
need only such gear or equipment as can
be found in any home, play center or
camp. Many, such as Save the Goldfish,
Animal Racing, and so on, can be
adapted to numbers and space. Illus-
trations clarify the text.

Fingers 1'0 hold

Who wants to walk alone when Daddy’s hand is there to hold?
Makes a girl feel the same size as everybody.

That’s the way all little girls and boys need to feel—safe in a
world of love where they can grow without fear. That’s where
the security we need begins—for every one of as.

To build security for those we love—that is our common dream—
a dream that can come true only in a country like America
where every man and woman is free to work for it.

It is by taking care of our own that we also make America
strong. For the strength of our country is simply the strength
of each secure home joined to the security of another. -

Saving for security is easy! Here’s a.
savings system that really works—the
Payroll Savings Plan for investing in
United States Savings Bonds.

This is all you do. Go to your company’s
pay office, choose the amount you want to
save—a couple of dollars a payday, or as
much as you wish. That money will be set
aside for you before you even draw your
pay. And automatically invested in Series
“E” Savings Bonds which are turned over

to you.

If you can save only $3.75 a week on
the Plan, in 9 years and 8 months you will
have $2,137.30. For your sake, and your
family’s, too, how about signing up today ?
