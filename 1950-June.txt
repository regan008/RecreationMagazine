A quiet wayside rest on a mountain trail in
Austria. Walking for the sheer joy of it has
long been a popular form of recreation the
world over. Today, increased interest and
significant advances in additional recreation
activities are reported in many lands. The
recreational habits of many peoples have
been influenced to large extent by the
American troops stationed there during or
since the last war. From all corners of the
globe letters and visitors come to the NRA
bringing recreation problems and inquiries.

"

OR' MORE THAN forty years, the National Rec—
F reation Association, as one of its services to
the recreation movement, has issued a municipal
recreation year book as a record of community
recreation facilities, expenditures, activities,
leadership and management in the United States
and Canada. The municipal year book, which is
now issued biennially, affords a guide to the
growth and development of community recreation.

In recent years, the expansion of community
recreation has been paralleled to a degree by the
growth of recreation activity on state and federal
levels as well as in other countries. No periodic
record comparable to that provided by the munici-
pal year book is now available concerning trends
and significant recreation developments in the
states, the Federal GOvernment or abroad.

The June 1946 issue of RECREATION carried
articles giving some of the information then avail-
able as to what was being done by the states in
the held of recreation. As Howard Braucher said
in his editorial for that issue: “The time has now
come when we should all know much more about
our state government'programs . .. . Whatever
may happen in localities and in the nation, it is
now clear that state government in the United
States is to have a large part in the recreation pic—
ture, that the people themselves wish it so, that
the peOple themselves are prepared to see con-
tinuous, generous, substantial support of state
government recreation programs.”

In January 1947, RECREATION published ma-
terial on several of the federal agencies making the
most important present peacetime contribution to
recreation. In his editorial for'that issue, Howard
Braucher said: “Both the articles on ,state govern-
ment recreation and federal recreation are parts
of a longer, more comprehensive study of what is
available in recreation'today, what is needed and
desired that is not now available . . . One can-
not well face what is needed without listing what

IUNE 1950

   

now is being done.”

In September 1948, RECREATION carried an ar-
ticle entitled “Internationally Speaking” which
described the part the National Recreation Asso-
ciation has played in establishing recreation
facilities and programs in many lands. A reference
was also made in that article to the first Inter-
national Recreation Congress held in Los Angeles
in 1932 which was organized by the association
with the cooperation of an advisory committee on
which thirty-two countries were represented.

In this issue of RECREATION, the National Rec-
reation Association presents statements in statis-
tical and narrative form concerning the services of
state and federal government agencies furnishing
recreation for the people. It also affords evidence
of recreational interests in many lands and recre-
ation projects initiated since the end of the Second
World War.

The association believes this issue will bring use-
ful and significant information to all who are in-
terested in recreation as an important phase of
life in the world today. Owing to limitations of
time and space, some of the information is in—
complete and fragmentary. If a publication of this
sort proves to meet a genuine need, and if the de-
mand merits, the association intends to publish a
state—federal-international recreation year book at
two—year intervals to alternate with its long-estab-
lished and well-received municipal recreation year
book. .

Grateful acknowledgment is given to the many
individuals and agencies that have furnished the
information, photographs and other material used

in this issue.

Selected Serviees et theNatienal lteereatien Asseeiatien

IN 1949

Most of the services listed below are equally available to, and used by, gov-
ernmental and private agencies in the United States—local, state and national.
Many of them are also extended to individuals and groups in other countries.

6,629 different communities, in every state (and including 262 foreign cities), received advice on recre-
ation problems through correspondence and consultation bureau.

8,273 recreation leaders and laymen interested in recreation (393 of them in foreign countries) received
RECREATION, the monthly magazine of the movement.

8 federal agencies with major concern for recreation were served directly or through the Federal
Inter-Agency Committee on Recreation by consultation or special held service.

48 states were helped with their state recreation problems and services. Four held workers, 3 full time
and 1 part time, were assigned to help state government agencies active in recreation.

1,000 delegates from 373 cities in 45 states and 2 foreign countries attended the 3lst National Recrea-
tion Congress.

3,000 cities, towns and villages participated in the 25th annual observance of National and International

Music Week.

14,334 employed and volunteer leaders (serving various racial groups) were given special training in
recreation skills, methods and programs at institutes held in 130 cities in 37 states.

1,552 cities were given requested service through the visits of held workers. Many cities were visited
several times during the year.

55 cities in 27 states were assisted through personal visits by the Katherine F. Barker Memorial Field
Secretary for Women and Girls.

103 cities in 24 states were helped by 3 held workers in the development of adequate recreation pro-
grams for minority groups.

51 cities in 17 states received special held service in connection with their plans to develop and
strengthen their service in arts and crafts. In 21 of these, special training institutes were conducted
for leaders.

25 cities received the personal services of the specialists on recreation areas and facilities and recre-
ation buildings.

17 appraisals of recreation administration, personnel and facilities were completed in 1949.

1,055 companies received periodical bulletins on industrial recreation problems and development. A num-
ber of industrial plants were visited by a special worker giving part time to help industries and
municipal recreation departments meet recreation needs of workers.

2,500 leaders received the Summer Playground Notebook which helps improve and extend playground
programs and services.

2,577 individuals received the Playground and Recreation Bulletin Service. The association’s publications

were more widely used in 1949 than ever before. A number of the new publications issued were
based upon comprehensive study and research.

9M RECREATION

SERVICES

7HE STORY OF what pe0ple of the nation are do-
ing for themselves in recreation, through their
state governments, is a thrilling one. It has been
an outstanding development in the field of recre-
ation since the war, and is not confined to any
one section of the country. In addition to the de-
velopment of state parks, forest recreation services,
fish and wildlife conservation, and the promotion
of tourist and vacation recreation activities, the
states are increasingly providing services to local
communities to assist them with their local recre—
ation problems. Thirty-five states have some ser-
vice of this type, ten employing one or more full-
time workers.

Rural areas in the states also are receiving more
and more help with their recreation programs.
F orty-one state agricultural services have at least
one worker giving part time to state leadership
in this field. Fourteen of these states have at
least one full-time person. In addition, county
extension workers include recreation in their pro-
grams in a majority of 'states.

Just as the Federal Government has created an
interagency recreation committee, so the states are
increasingly establishing similar cooperative ma-
chinery. State committees are generally composed
of state counterparts of the federal agencies plus
such agencies as planning and development boards.
A few states include private groups; three states
have recreation boards or commissions.

State Interagency Committees

Interagency and interdepartmental committees
on the state level were first set up in 1946 for the

purpose of exchanging information among state
departments concerned with recreation and with
Similar groups in other states, providing means

118

 

Pennsylvania State Department of Commerce

for mutual assistance, clarifying the responsibilities
and functions of state and local governments, dis—
covering areas where recognized recreation ser-
vices are not being provided by state departments
and planning for meeting these needs, and de-
termining where special studies or surveys may
be desirable and recommending plans for making
them.

Interagency organizations are a ‘means of pro-
viding such coordination without setting up a new
governmental agency or expending additional
funds. Membership is usually restricted to state
departments, although some states include private
agencies among their members. A complete list
of the states now having such committees will be
found in the check list on page 122. The plans and
services of the committees mentioned below are
typical of those now actively functioning.

The State Inter-Agency Committee in California
was established by the governor on February 24,
1950 for the purpose of seeking maximum utiliza-
tion of the state’s recreation resources. It will
determine what recreation problems involve
various agencies, such as the State Recreation
Commission, Department of Education, Depart-
ment of Natural Resources, Department of Public
Health, and so on. Wider utilization of camping
facilities, including those at state beaches and
parks, will be studied, and problems of community
recreation given attention.

The Michigan State Inter—Agency Council on
Recreation, composed of twelve state departments
and advisory groups that have a responsibility for
recreation, was organized in 1947. It coordinates
the recreation activities and functions of the state
arms of government, promotes and develops over-
all public recreation programs for the state, recom—

RECREATION

mends needed recreation activities to the proper
state departments, develops a continuous and sys-
tematic program of fact-finding on recreation
needs, and, encourages communities to set up
adequate recreation programs. This year, it is
initiating a two-year experimental program to give
better recreation leadership to the state. Funds
have been provided by the \V. K. Kellogg Founda-
tion to employ a full-time executive secretary
who will carry on the work of the committee.

The Minnesota Governor’s Advisory Committee
On Recreation, established May 9, 1946, has com-
pleted a study of state agency recreation programs.
The executive committee has voted to present a
bill to the 1951 state legislature for the creation
of aostate recreation commission to be set up to
devise ways and means of carrying on a state
consultant service.

The first project of the Mississippi Inter-
Agency Recreation Committee, which was organ-
ized in 1948, was a survey of the recreation
programs and objectives of state agencies engaged
in recreation activities, people served, resources,
problems and needs as seen by these agencies. The
results will be used by the steering committee in
formulating a program. A series of district con—
ferences has been sponsored to enable city and
county officials, recreation board members and
community leaders to discuss methods of develop—
ing city‘ and rural recreation programs. Mississippi
is one of the two states in which the committee
has sponsored training institutes for professional
recreation leaders. ,

The Interdepartmental Committee on Recre-
ation‘ in Tennessee has also sponsored leadership
training institutes and program organization
meetings. The committee is attempting to.stimu-
late recreation in very small communities by work-
ing through local committees to determine the
type of program wanted and the proper approach
, to attain it.

The \Vashington Inter-Agency Committee on
Recreation, under the active chairmanship of the
governor, was created early in 1949. Its objec-
tives are to utilize the facilities and knowledge of
the various departments, coordinate their activities
in an effort to improve facilities for out-of-state
guests, and assist communities in developing their
own recreation programs. Printed material is now
being prepared to be circulated among local offi-
cials to inform them of the state’s resources in
personnel. equipment and facilities which will aid
them in their program promotion.

The committees in Louisiana and Michigan are
making studies of state agency recreation pro-

IUNE 1950

grams, and the \Vashington committee has made
a study of park and recreation facilities in the
state. In Missouri, the committee has approved a

set of principles to guide federal agencies in de-
ve10ping plans in the state.

State Colleges and Universities

The work done by the state colleges and univer—
sities through their extension divisions was re-
ported at some length in the State Recreation
Issue of RECREATION magazine, published in June,
1946. Since then, many of these institutions have
expanded their services, and others have employed
field recreation consultants and community ser-
vice directors to “take the college off campus,”
and provide advisory service to communities.
Short courses, conferences and workshops for in-
dividuals and community groups are offered; the
drama and music departments often take their
productions on state-wide tours; art exhibitions
are held; poetry, drama and music festivals, in
which local poets, dramatists and musicians are
given a hearing, are sponsored; cooperation on
solving community problems is given; and endless
queries are answered by correspondence.

The examples presented below of services
offered by the state colleges do not include agri-
cultural colleges, which are discussed in the sec-
tion on agricultural extension services. Neither
is any reference made to the private colleges,
although many of them are "doing valuable work
in this field.

The Extension Division of the University of
Florida has for several years sponsored short
recreation training courses conducted by specialists
of the National Recreation Association. In 1948,
fourteen three-day courses were held throughout
the state and, in 1949, thirteen one-week courses.

Considerable service to communities in the state
is available through the University of Idaho. A
member of the staff of the Department of Physical
Education has been visiting communities; on re-
quest, to assist with the organization of recreation
programs. He has also aided the Agricultural
Extension Service in recreation leadership train-
ing work.

Indiana University employs two recreation con-
sultants who have conducted short training courses
and classes for professional recreation leaders,
school teachers and other groups in folk and square
dancing and social recreation. It makes surveys
and gives assistance with local recreation prob-
lems. In cooperation with various park organiza-
tions, the university organizes and directs the

annual Great Lakes Park Training Institute at
Pokagon State Park. ,

The University of Iowa is preparing a catalogue
of audio-visual aids which will represent the
largest collection of films ever made available in
Iowa. A play festival is held each spring during
which two days are set aside for community group
participation. The university sponsors periodic
art exhibitions, with civic organizations and com-
munity groups invited to arrange for special visits
—lectures given by qualified guides.

In 1946, the University of Minnesota appointed
a field recreation consultant who visits com-
munities, makes comprehensive community sur-
veys as well as more limited surveys of recreation
facilities, and assists with a wide variety of local
problems, such as the formation of youth councils,
leadership training, referendums and administra-
tive matters. The university is cooperating with
the state mental hospitals in training recreation
leaders for work with the h03pital patients.

The community services program of the Uni-
versity of Nebraska has assisted numerous small
communities in 'such projects as forming com-
munity councils, developing parks and other rec-
reation facilities, working out leisure-time activity
programs for various groups, housing libraries,
and conducting workshops for leaders. The super-
visor of the program visits communities, on re—
quest, and helps to analyze needs, survey re-
sources, and plan action programs to strengthen
areas of community life which do not appear to be
fully developed.

The University of New Hampshire’s recreation
specialist has done a great deal in the field of
community recreation organization. She holds in-
stitutes, works with schools, and serves as a state
recreation field consultant. The university co-

120

operates with other state departments in promoting
state—wide recreation through university sources.

The University of Oklahoma holds short courses
and conferences for such diversified' groups as
those of mothers, swimming pool operators, scout
leaders and drum majors. The activities scheduled
by the extension division in 1949 included poetry
and massed band festivals, radio and audio-visual
conferences, the annual camping institute and a
marching band clinic.

A series of three-day institutes in various parts
of the state had been sponsored by the University
of Tennessee. These were open without charge to
all adults interested in recreation leadership. The
university is promoting community organization
for recreation, but the work is largely in the plan-
ning stage at the present time.

The Extension Division of the University of
Utah offers square dance institutes fo'r Mormon
recreation leaders and those of other groups, and
operates a children’s swimming program and an
athletic program for the eight-to-fourteen-year-
old age group in the university area. The courses
given in arts and crafts appreciation are continually
oversubscribed, and the division’s film loan library
is steadily growing in order to meet demands.

State Parks

For state parks, the period between 1946 and
1950 was one of rehabilitation and growth. During
the war years, there was virtually no expansion
or construction of new facilities, and even the nor-
mal maintenance operations were sharply cur-
tailed because of the shortage of personnel and
materials. After the war, with people increasingly
turning to outdoor recreation in leisure hours, the
state park authorities found that their areas and
facilities were seriously overtaxed. On the whole,
they have risen -to the occasion. New areas have
been acquired, new facilities constructed, and
plans made for greater expansion in the future.

Recreation leaders and nature specialists are
being hired by park authorities, and the programs
provided by these leaders, as well as the trailside
museums and exhibits that have been set up, have
brought to the people a greater understanding of
the beauty and value of their parks and wilder-
ness areas, and increased enjoyment in their use.

Space does not permit a detailed report of the
improvements that have been made in all state
parks since 1946, but the states mentioned here
are among those which have provided increased
park services or facilities in the postwar years.*

 

‘More detailed information on developments in these and other
states available from 1949 Yearbook of Park: and Recreation Progress,
published by the National Conference on State Parks. Washington.
D. C., from WhtCh a great part of this data. was taken.

RECREATION

The California Division of Beaches and Parks
has been faced with a serious overutilization prob-
lem which has resulted in damage to many of the
areas. A gradual change in the division’s policy
of fostering conducted athletic activities is now
proposed, and nearly all phases of the recreation
program that do not emphasize the natural attrac-
tions of the parks will be excluded. Naturalists
will continue to conduct nature walks and camp-
fire programs, which have proved extremely
p0pular and which are believed to have assisted
the ranger force in preserving the parks. A system
of nature trails with trail-side exhibits is being
developed, and a full-time staff is working on the
production of mounted specimens and dioramas
for a central nature lodge. Several other smaller
museums are also being set up. About 110 miles
of a proposed 3,000 mile hiking and riding trail
system, extending in a loop from one end of the
state to the other, have been completed.

In Iowa, s_ums appropriated for the implemen-
tation of the “Twenty—five—year Conservation
Plan” are to be expended for major repairs, capital
improvements and additional areas. Since the
southern portion of Iowa has no natural lakes, a
large part of the appropriation has been allocated
for the development of artificial lakes, the ultimate
aim being to have a body of water for recreation
use within twenty-live miles of every home.

Michigan has made great progress in providing
recreation opportunities in state parks. Archery
ranges have been established; areas have been
closed to hunting and set aside for the training
of hunting dogs and conducting of field trials;
canoe trips, with landings and campsites, have
been mapped on a few streams; winter sports are
being encouraged in appropriate locations; bridle,
foot and nature trails are being improved and ex-
tended; areas have been opened for hunting and
trapping on park land wherever possible. The line
camping program, conducted in c00peration with
the Department of Public Instruction, is discussed
in the section devoted to state education depart-
ments.

New York has succeeded admirably in estab-
lishing provisions for many kinds of recreation
without damaging the natural characteristics of
the areas used. Swimming, skiing, tobogganing,
roller and ice skating, miniature and regulation
golf, tennis, archery and softball, to mention but
a few activities, may all be enjoyed in New York’s
extensive park system.

After a long period during which there was no
expansion, Oklahoma embarked on a development
program in 1947 under which one park is being

JUNE 1950

provided with a lodge building, dining and dance
halls and forty sleeping cabins. This project will
be completed early in 1950. Ninety-eight build-
ings of various types have been constructed in
seven areas, and a 3,000-acre tract of land has
been acquired on which a new state park will be
developed in the course of the next live years.

Extensive additions, totalling more than 7,300
acres, have been made to Oregon’s state parks
since 1946. The state now controls all but twenty-
three miles of its 325 miles of coast line, and a
recent report by the chief counsel of the highway
commission recommended that “the shore be de-
clared purely recreational, from which operation
of motor vehicles would be prohibited.” Plans for
acquiring additional coastal areas are under way,
and observation shelters overlooking the ocean
have been constructed.

Day camps, conservation training schools and
nature clubs are operated in the parks of South
Carolina. Trailer-type cabins have been bought
and full-scale cabins built to serve as family vaca-
tion units. The demand for organized camping
facilities and family cabins is greater than can
be met at the present time.

The Tennessee Division of State Parks employs
a recreation planner who assists city and county
oflicials in planning and deve10ping local parks
and recreation areas, and a program specialist
who plans special events and recreation activities
and promotes a better understanding of nature
and outdoor activities.

Work on a project for providing group activity
camps in the parks is under way in Texas. Con-
struction has been started in one park and plans
for live others are now in preparation. Another
project, the removal of weeds and heavy vegeta-
tion from lishing lakes, was so successful in early
experimehts that it is being continued.

The program in Washington places a heavy
emphasis on camping. Overnight camps, trailer
camps and group camps for young pe0p1e are now
being operated, and additional facilities are being
constantly added. \Vashington encourages the
volunteer assistance of community groups in the
development of poorly-equipped parks, and some
of this work has been extremely successful.

Agricultural Extension Services

The Agricultural Extension Service, established
by law in 1914, is jointly administered by the
United States Department of Agriculture, the
state agricultural colleges, county governments
and farm organizations. Its objective is to im—

prove the economic, social and cultural life of the
rural population; and steadily increasing empha-
sis is being placed on recreation as an important
factor in attaining this goal. During 1949, forty-
two states gave recreation service through ABS,
and fourteen had at least one full-time worker.
Since the need is so great, and the number of
trained recreation leaders so small, "most of these
workers devoted their time to organizing and con-
ducting leadership training institutes. Working
with leaders of 4-H clubs, home demonstration
units, farm women’s groups and other rural or-
ganizations, they are gradually building a trained
staff of recreation leaders who will bring increased
enjoyment of music, drama, crafts, dancing, social
recreation and many other activities to farm
homes and communities.

A great deal of extension service work is done
through the 4-H clubs, which sponsor summer
camps, recreation institutes, activity programs and
tours, in addition to carrying on their farm train-
ing and homemaking programs. A rural arts and
recreation program, sponsored by the 4-H clubs
in c00peration with the United States Rubber
Company for the purpose of developing recreation
opportunities and stimulating an appreciation of
rural arts, has aroused a great deal of interest.
In 1948, there were 1,829,250 members—an all-
time record—enrolled in 81,000 4-H clubs.

Farm women’s organizations have for many
years sponsored group camps, affording their

members enjoyable and educational camping
eXperiences.

The states specifically mentioned in this brief
summary are typical of many others that are giv-
ing recreation service to rural areas through AES.

In Arkansas, where a full-time community ac-
tivity specialist was employed for the first time
in 1949, real progress has been made in estab-
lishing continuing activities, with local people as-
suming responsibility for carrying out plans made
under the guidance of the specialist.

Home demonstration clubs in Colorado have
sponsored community nights and bookmobiles. One
club has made boxes in which books can be carried
in private cars to areas beyond the range of
regular library service. These home demonstra-
tion units have shown a growing interest in music
and crafts, particularly leathercraft. In many in-
stances, the members themselves tan the leather
with which they work. Colorado’s full-time rec-
reation specialist has been on leave for graduate
study during most of the past year and, on his
return, early in 1950, he plans to initiate a series
of training institutes more comprehensive in scope
than anything previously attempted in the state.

The annual report of Georgia’s recreation
specialist stated that during 1949, 31,161 residents
had improved their home recreation; 1,442 com-
munities were assisted in recreation (some of this
work was done through county agents) ; and 282
club and community houses were created. Local
talent contests, featuring almost every imaginable
type of talent, have been sponsored by AES.

A full-time recreation specialist in Kansas has
been appointed only recently, and work in this
state is still in the planning stage. There has been
little recreation in the 4-H program and the
present plan is to introduce it in county-wide
meetings as a preliminary to starting leadership
training institutes. A party book and other re-
source material will be issued.

Louisiana’s assistant rural sociologist devotes
much of her time to recreation service, her pro—
gram consisting largely of square dancing, stunts,
party games and social activities. Training courses
sponsored by her are usually of a demonstrational
nature.

The full—time recreation' specialists in Massa—
chusetts hold leaders’ training institutes for adults
and youth, give advisory service to communities
in planning and organizing local services, and pro-
vide holiday bulletins, lending libraries and loan
kits. They also assist with camping programs
and promote home recreation.

In New Mexico, the rural drama program is
attracting increasing participation. Ten counties
produced one-act plays at the 4—H summer camp

in 1949, and district play contests are planned
for 1950. Handcrafts are also popular -——- almost
every county in the state had a handcrafts school

RECREATION

I last spring. New Mexico has a large Spanish-
I speaking population and 4-H leaders are giving
recreation services to this group. A state-wide
Isocial recreation program is sponsored by the
women of the Farm Bureau. To promote group
and community singing, a new songbook, contain—
ing fifty—four numbers, has been published and
l distributed to all 4-H club members.

Special training for summer camp leaders was
given to approximately 1,800 4-H club members
in Oregon last year. Leadership training insti—
tutes were conducted in five counties, and many
single meetings, with emphasis on games and song
leadership, were held. Special meetings for home
economics unit leaders concentrated on party
planning, family and unit
recreation, textile painting
and gift wrapping.

 Th e annual program
staged by AES at the
Pennsylvania State Fair
includes bands, dramatics,
singing, sports, drills, folk
dancing and games. A
great deal of attention is

given to older rural youth

clubs, and specialists are

engaged to give institute

training .in crafts, nature,
l social recreation and other activities.

Training meetings held in Texas stressed social
recreation, folk dancing and mixers. Creative
dramatics are arousing increasing interest. Con—
siderable resource material has been published,
including a fifty—four page booklet entitled “Play
Through the Day,” a twenty-nine page booklet,

“Let’s Have Fun,” and shorter bulletins on a
variety of recreation topics. , Two hundred fifty
summer camps were held throughout the state
last year.

At the Washington State Fair in 1950, a rec-
reation leadership contest will be arranged, with
different county groups organizing and directing
three evenings of mixers. This is an outgrowth
of the program staged in one county last fall
which was so successful that other counties asked
for a similar opportunity. At the annual 4-H
camp, each camper was required to take two rec-
reation courses daily for four days. The home
demonstration agents’ refresher course devoted an
entire afternoon to handcrafts.

State Library Services
Since reading is probably the most pOpular

JUNE 1950

leisure-time activity in the United States, many
city—dwellers with excellent libraries within easy
reach may {ind almost incredible the idea that
books are an unattainable luxury to some of our
citizens in many rural areas. In such sections, the
work of the state libraries is of inestimable value,
for they are steadily expanding such services as
providing loan collections to schools and com-
munity gi'oups, sending out bookmobiles, making
trained librarians available to give lectures and
stimulate interest in setting up local libraries, and
circulating film, record and art reproduction col-
lections. Many state libraries sponsor programs
designed to promote reading for pleasure and the
acquisition of knowledge among children and

adults, furnish facilities for technical study and
offer research services.

It is a far cry from the first book wagon sent out
in 1907 by the Washington County Free Library

' in Hagerstown, Maryland, to the great trucks

and trailers, carrying thousands of volumes, that
travel the country roads today. Staffed by trained
librarians, who are anxious to guide both children
and adults to a knowledge of the best in literature,
these bookmobiles are one of the most valuable
services offered by the state libraries. Each one
has a definite schedule of stops, usually at a cen—
tral location in the community, and its patrons
wait eagerly for its weekly, biweekly or monthly
visits.

In addition to dispatching bookmobiles, the
Library Extension Service in Georgia sponsors
vacation reading clubs for school children, which
any child who has completed the second grade is
eligible to join. State certificates are awarded to
any member reading ten approved books, and gold
star certificates are offered to those who read
twenty-live approved books. The extension ser—
vice also circulates films and recordings to schools

equipped to use them. The Federated Home
Demonstration Clubs of Georgia have donated a
bookmobile to the department to be used as an
exhibit. It will travel through counties not having
such a unit to encourage the establishment of
additional bookmobiles in the state.

The State Library in Maine ships collections of
books in twenty-five or fifty-volume sets to com-
munities or organized groups. These may be kept
for a six-month period and the only charge is for
transportation.

In Michigan, radio broadcasts by “The Book-
mobile Lady” tie in with the particular selection
of children’s books being distributed by the book-
mobile at the time the broadcast is given.

In 1947, the Missouri State Legislature appro-
priated $50,000 for bookmobile service to areas
without public libraries. The service is adminis-
tered by the Missouri State Library. Librarians
traveling with these units are prepared to give
book reviews and talks, plan and participate in
club programs, show films, conduct recorded
music hours, tell stories to children, and give as-
sistance with recreational and educational pro-
grams in the communities they visit. '-

Oregon’s State Library Board promotes the
establishment of county or regional libraries in
thinly populated areas. The traveling library has
376 stations, and loo-volume sets of books are
sent to_ many group camps during the summer
months. The state archivist is promoting the
writing of histories of communities in the state,
to be entitled “Your Home Town,” for the state
records and distribution to interested persons.

The State Library Commission in South Dako-
ta holds district meetings as training schools for

126

leaders of extension reading clubs. The librarian
spends fifty per cent of her time in the field, where
she works to improve the operation of small local
libraries and create interest among women’s
groups for more support of such facilities. She
makes fivexlists annuallyJof books that are recom-
mended for various group‘sgrsuc‘h .as women’s
clubs and home extension members. - mash”;

Enabling legislation in Virginia allows counties
to cooperate in providing regional library service.
A regulatory law sets standards for local libraries
and librarians.

In addition, some states are providing
special services, such as the “talking books” avail-
able in New York through the Library for the
Blind.

State Recreation Commissions

The state board or commission is a compara-
tive newcomer to the recreation field, all those
now in existence having been created since the
beginning of ’1945. Three states ~—-— California,
North Carolina and Vermont —- now have such
commissions, all of which had their inception in a
growing recognition of the importance of recre-
ation and a desire to have the state provide rec-

reation service to communities.

All three commissions are non-operating agen-
cies, their functions being to provide advisory
service to communities, sponsor training institutes,
organize state conferences, and make surveys of
programs and facilities where requested. Their
members are appointed by the governors of the
respective states, and they serve without com-
pensation. A fourth state, Washington, has a
State Parks and Recreation Commission, which
differs from the others in thatr‘it is the state park
authority. Its services to communities are much
the same as those of the other ‘state commissions
except that it places considerably more emphasis
on camping.

California—The California State Recreation
Commission was created July 8, 1947, and con-
sists of seven members. It employs a director,
assistant director and four recreation Specialists,
each of whom serves a specific geographical area.
The estimated budget for the fiscal year 1949-50
is $87,143. In addition to its other services, the
commission has made a personnel study covering
job analysis, curriculum standards, in-service
training and employment practices, the results of
which were published in a comprehensive volume
entitled “Standards for Professional Recreation
Personnel”. A state-wide survey of community
recreation has been made, and a compilation of
laws relating to recreation has been published.

RECREATION

.The commission's first publication, a manual
covering the organization and operation of leader—
ship training institutes, was the outcome of a
training project carried on under the auSpices of
the Committee for the Study of Recreation in
California, prior to the creation of the commission.
Service was rendered by the commission to 660
governmental agencies, organizations and individ-
uals in the fiscal year 1948-49.

' North C arolina—First of the state commissions
to make its appearance, the North Carolina Rec-
reation Commission was created March 19, 1945.
It is composed of seven appointed and four ex
officio members, the latter being the Governor, the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Com-
,missioner of' Public Welfare, and the Director of
the Department of , Conservation and Develop-
ment. One of the'seven appointed members must
be a woman and one must be a Negro. The com-
mission employs a director, an assistant director
and a field representative.

A report of the work of the commission to mid-
1946 appeared in the State Recreation Issue of
RECREATION magazine. Since then, in addition to
continuing and expanding the services reported,
the commission has conducted inventories on
camping, youth-serving agencies and various
phases of commercial recreation. A state-wide
community recreation survey, made in 1948,
covered administration, finance, areas and facili—
ties, programs and personnel.

V ermontl —— Although the State Recreation
Board did not come into existence until April I,
'1947, Vermont was the first state to employ a
full-time recreation director, this position having
been created in 1943. Three members make up
- the board, and two staff workers, the director and
an office assistant are employed. The budget for
the present biennium is $11,000 annually. In 1949,
the Vermont Director of Recreation assisted com-
munities with recreation surveys, appraisals and
inventories, organization and planning of pro-
grams and facilities, budgets and personnel prob-
lems ; recruited, interviewed and referred workers
to communities; conducted training institutes,
workshops and clinics; held quarterly meetings
with full-time, year-round executives; and con—
ducted the seventh annual Governor’s Conference
on. Recreation. Four United Nations Secretariat
recreation week-ends were arranged in coopera-
tion with communities, and official visitors from
Germany were assisted in the study of recreation
in Vermont.

Washington—The State Parks and Recreation
Commission, successor to the State Parks Com-

]UNE 1950

mittee, was established June 11, 1947. In addition
to operating the state parks, the commission em-
ploys a recreation specialist and a camping
specialist. The hiring of a recreation director,
which was originally planned, has been indefinitely
postponed. The amount allotted to recreation for
the present biennium is $79,000.

youth-serving agencies set up on the state level
approach the problem of recreation for youth in a
variety of ways. Some states have devoted almost
all of their efforts to operating camps and training
schools for boys and girls who have been brought
before the courts on delinquency charges, study-
ing delinquency conditions and aiding commu-
nities in preventive work. Others, such as Minne-
sota and New York, have given active assistance
to communities in establishing youth recreation
programs, in the belief that juvenile delinquency
automatically decreases when worthwhile leisure-
time activities are provided.

In Minnesota, the Governor’s Advisory Com-
mittee on Recreation has published a report,
“Recreational Resources of the People of Minne-
sota,” which contains numerous recommendations
for improving recreation opportunities in that
state. Pending enactment of the legislation neces-
sary to put these recommendations into effect, the
Youth Conservation Commission has been re-
quested to carry on some of the recommended
activities, including the establishment of experi-
mental county-wide recreation programs in two
or three counties. The commission plans to hire
a recreation consultant who will continue and ex-
pand the present work of assisting communities in
developing their own youth commissions, councils
and recreation programs.

The New York State Youth Commission pro-
vides state aid for approved youth bureaus and
recreational and educational projects up to fifty
per cent of the sum expended by the sponsoring
municipality, within certain specified limitations.
As of September 1, 1949, the commission had
assisted forty—three per cent  of the 1,600
cities, counties, villages and towns in the state in
providing recreation programs. Approximately
2,700 persons are annually employed for recre-
ation leadership by communities with state aid
from the commission. Nearly every community
with a population of 5,000 or over had an or-

ganized recreation program in 1949, and the com-
mission is assisting an increasing number of com-

munities to develop year-round programs. In (:0-
operation with the New York State Public
Recreation Society, the commission has sponsored
area training institutes in which nearly 4,000 rec-
reation leaders have received training since the
Spring of 1947. '

The State Youth Development Council in
Texas cooperates with other agencies to provide
constructive programs for youth. It assists local
authorities, on request, in surveying needs and de-
veloping, strengthening and coordinating pro-
grams. A recently employed recreation consultant
is now studying methods used in other states to
determine the most efficient means of financing
and developing recreation programs.

In several states, youth work is under the De—
partment of Public Welfare. In Colorado, a group
worker in recreation, employed by this depart-
ment, conducts leadership training institutes and
promotes recreation conferences. Much of her
work is with PTA groups that have indicated
their willingness to assume leadership in initiating
recreation programs.

Education Departments

State departments of education are rendering
several different types of service to communities
in connection with their recreation programs. In
California and New York, full-time workers give
community recreation consultation service. The
California consultant conducts “Self-Study Plan
Surveys,” in which he evaluates local programs
on the basis of data collected by community
groups. Several other states occasionally give ad-
vice and assistance on community recreation

problems through their departments of health,
physical education and recreation.

'128

Financial aid to community recreation programs
is given through the state education departments
in Florida, Pennsylvania and Washington. In
Pennsylvania, approximately 600 school districts
conduct such programs with about eighty per cent
of the money supplied from state tax funds.

Extensive training programs for recreation
leaders are conducted through state education
agencies in Alabama, Maryland, Virginia and
Washington. In addition to sponsoring training
institutes and conferences, Virginia makes about
half time of a staff worker available to communi-
ties for recreation service, giving assistance with
local problems and suggesting other sources of
aid. Washington’s Department of Education has
received $6,000 from the Kellogg Foundation for
in-service training for teachers working on sum-
mer recreation programs. Some type of camping
—day, overnight, week-end, or hikes—was car-
ried on in sixty-nine school districts in the state
in 1949. The department also renders extensive
consultant service to communities.

Michigan’s school camping program is recog-
nized as outstanding, and has been widely studied
by authorities from other states. Some schools
own and control their own camps, but the majority
of the day, week-end, summer and overnight
camps conducted are on state park property, and
the cooperation between the two state depart-
ments is exemplary.

Game and Fish Agencies

The programs sponsored by the state game and
fish agencies indicate that they consider the edu-
cation of the public an important part of their
work. In addition to acquiring and developing
new areas for hunting and fishing and conserving
the resources of existing areas, these agencies are
attempting to train hunters and fishermen to en-
joy their sport without damaging the land or
unduly depleting the available supply of fish and
game. At least two states, Indiana and Vermont,
employ workers who give recreation leadership
in connection with hunting and fishing programs.

In Florida, the “Fishathons” for young people,
sponsored by the State Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission in various communities, have
brought out thousands of young anglers. The
commission conducts a conservation-education
program and promotes bait casting, archery, field
trials and other forms of outdoor recreation. .

The Nebraska Game, Forestation and Parks
Commission assists in developing farm ponds
for fishing, and cooperates with land owners and
sportmen’s groups in fencing off waste plots of

land and planting them with trees and shrubs as

a means of distributing good hunting throughout
the state.

The Game and Fish Commission of Okla-
homa has improved and developed large game
refuges, conducted projects in quail rehabilitation
and antelope habitat improvement, and initiated
an extensive fish-planting program.

The Washington Department of Game has set
up juvenile fishing areas, open only to fishermen
under sixteen years of age, on thirty-four lakes
and streams, and has developed public access
areas for fishing on fifty—five lakes. It conducts a
long-range program for improving hunting and
fishing, including big-game range purchase and
development and the operating of fish hatcheries
and game farms. The department now owns or

controls 77,000 acres for the propagation of wild-
life.

State Planning Agencies

State planning agencies are giving increasing
attention to the requests of local communities for
assistance in planning and developing recreation
areas, facilities and programs. The Alabama
State Planning Board aids communities in rec-
reation area planning and issues mimeographed
bulletins on special structures as a guide to local
planners. Frequently, board technicians actually
design local recreation areas, and the board co-
Operates, on request, in formulating supervisory,

administrative and operational procedures. It has
issued a comprehensive survey of recreation in
Alabama with specific recommendations.

The Division of Resources and Development in
Missouri has been primarily concerned with the
development of state recreation areas and publicity
for the purpose of encouraging tourists to visit
the state, but much recreation service has been
given to communities. The division employs three
recreation assistants: one to handle community
recreation problems; one to deal with community
and state-wide planning; and the third to be re-
sponsible for tourist recreation.

In Pennsylvania, the State Planning Board has
held district recreation meetings in c00peration
with the Public Service Institute of the Depart—
ment of Public Instruction. For the purpose of
these meetings, the state has been so divided that
no delegate has had to travel more than sixty
miles to attend, and attendance has averaged fifty
at each meeting. The board conducts a con-
tinuous survey of community recreation programs
through questionnaires sent to local agencies, and
a full-time consultant is in charge of the recre-
ation service activities.

Such services are typical of those being offered
by other state planning agencies. Because of the
great demand from communities, many of these
agencies are planning to expand their consultation
service as soon as possible.

THE NATIONAL RECREATION As a part of its general program of field ser-

proud of the work it has done over the years
in assisting and serving state government agencies
whose services relate to recreation. The material
concerning state recreation programs included in
this year book has come in large measure from re-
ports of the association’s field staff.

For some fifteen years a special recreation lead—
ership training program was provided, without
charge, to state agricultural extension services by
arrangement with the U. S.'Department of Agri—
culture. For more (than twenty years the Na-
tional Physical Education Service of the associa-
tion played an important part in the deve10pment
of school physical education programs through
its service to state education authorities.

136

vice, the association, since 1943, has been giving
increasing attention to all agencies of state gov—
ernment concerned with recreation. The attempt
has been made to reach every agency with exist-
ing or potential recreation functions, to learn
about their programs, tell other agencies within
the same state about these programs, and provide
an exchange of experience between related depart-
ments in the various states.

All other services of the association are made
available to state agencies, including, among oth-
ers, correspondence and consultation, recreation
personnel service, RECREATION magazine and
other publications, the National Recreation Con—
gress and training programs.

As part of an increasing responsibility for the recreation of the people, the Fed-

m»: INTEREST AND activities of the Federal
Government in recreation are not new. They
centered first in the use of federal land and water
areas for recreation and date back to June 30,
1864, when an act of Congress was approved
granting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big
Tree Grove to the State of California for recre—
ation uses ;* and to March I, 1872, when Presi-
dent Grant signed the bill creating Yellowstone
National Park—the first national park in the
world—as “a public park or pleasuring ground
for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.”
Through the years, other long—established federal
agencies have taken up the concern with recre—
ation as a basic human need and therefore a social
and civic necessity, and have created a fine record
of active service to the nation in this field. Federal
governmental activity in relation to the recreation
aspect of living has its principal justification, as
in the case of all social and protective services,
in the Preamble and Article I, Section 8 of the
Constitution. To “promote the general welfare”
is, of course, listed as one of the purposes of that
document and of the government which it created.
Each agency has contributed to a different phase
of the work; and, in 1946, the Federal Inter-
Agency Committee was born, in order to make
cooperation possible and to facilitate united action.
The committee, composed of representatives of
these federal agencies—the Corps of Engineers,
National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Forest Service, Extension Service, Office of Edu-
cation, Children’s Bureau, the Public Housing
Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation

U. 3. Fish and Wildlife Service, by E. P. Haddon

Wildlife refuges protect game. Sign at
entrance to National Bison Range, Mont.

—-—serves as a clearing house for the exchange of
information on policies, plans, methods, ex-
periences and procedures among the agencies;
considers all current agency problems and proj-
ects presented to it and recommends basic prin-
ciples which might well be followed in these and
similar projects and problems; and endeavors to
facilitate the provision of information about the
recreation activities of federal agencies.

It seeks to clarify the proper responsibilities
of the Federal Government in the field of public
recreation, and to discover and face existing gaps
in meeting these responsibilities, with special
consideration of the needs of small communities
and rural areas, minority groups, young people,
older adults and women and girls.

The member agencies of the committee co—
operate’ in stimulating and assisting state agen-
cies in the development of needed recreation
facilities and services, in accordance with co-
operative plans developed by the committee, so
far as resources make this possible.

Federal recreation functions would seem to
divide themselves into three different types of
activities: (I) those related to the operation of
federally-owned properties, such as parks, forests,
wildlife preserves, hospitals, military establish-
ments, reservoir areas, housing projects, and so
forth; (2) those related to advisory services in
connection with the promotion, planning and
operation of state and local community park and
recreation programs; (3) those related to the
provision of recreation facilities and activities for
persons employed by the Federal Government.

Current operations of federal agencies in con-

RECREATION

nection with the type of activity referred to under
number two show that the functions cover:

I. Planning for recreation in cooperation with
other Federal Government and quasi-govern—
mental agencies and with national organizations.

2. Consultative services to the states, and their
subdivisions through the states, on the problems
of planning, development and operation of park
and recreation programs and services.

3. The collection and dissemination of data
and information necessary for carrying out the
above functions.

The government, at all levels, is providing fa—
cilities and services at a rapidly increasing rate.
The Congress of the United States has supported
the recreation activities of federal agencies
through enabling legislation and apprOpriations.
Public Opinion not only supports existing federal
activities in the recreation field, but is urging even
greater service.

The 'Federal Government has an increasing
responsibility for the recreation of the people, to
be met not only through providing federal lands
and facilities, but also through extending existing
services to the states and political subdivisions
through the states to help them plan and deveIOp
their facilities and services.

Bills which would authorize creation of a special
federal recreation service have been introduced
into both houses of the 813t Congress, but no final
action has yet been taken.

In the following summary of the functions and
activities of the federal agencies concerned with
recreation for the public, no reference is made
to the recreation programs conducted by such
agencies for their own personnel.

corps of Engineers—Under the direction of
the Secretary of the Army, in accordance with
specific authority of Congress, this agency prose-
cutes the federal program for the improvement
and maintenance of rivers and other waterways
in the interest of navigation and flood control.
This is an important part of the over-all program
for conservation, control and utilization of the
nation’s water resources in the public interest.
The development of such projects results in the
creation of many and varied opportunities for
recreational enjoyment. Particularly the creation
of new or enlarged water areas, in localities lack-
ing in such resources, frequently results in sig—
nihcant recreational benefits in addition to the
benefits from the primary purposes of the project.

In the proper administration of a reservoir
area, priority is given to serving the needs of the
general public. This involves concern for many

JUNE 1950

related activities, among them the planning and
developing of the areas and facilities for recre-
ation. In acting upon this, preference ordinarily
is given in the following order:

I. Public day use facilities, such as observation
points, picnic facilities, access roads and hiking
trails.

2. Public boat-launching and docking facilities.
3. Public camp grounds.

4. Organized camps operated by governmental,
educational, recreational, eleemosynary, charac—

ter-building or other non-profit organizations or
agencies which are functioning in the public
interest.

Among the recreational activities for which
completed reservoirs are being utilized are the
following: fishing, sailing, canoeing, boat races,
camping, picnicking, nature study, organized
camping. Attendance varies from a few thousand
at small isolated projects to approximately 2.3
million at the Denison Dam and Reservoir proj-
ect in 1949. The tabulation on page 142 indicates
the name, location and approximate attendance
at some of the completed projects during the
calendar year 1949. Master reservoir manage-
ment plans are prepared in cooperation with in-
terested federal, state and local agencies.

In many of the completed reservoir projects,
the Corps of Engineers has provided reasonable
access to the shores of the reservoir, parking areas
and measures to protect the health and safety of
the public. Broad licenses of twenty-five to fifty
years’ duration have been granted to state, county
and city park and recreation agencies under
which those agencies will undertake or are un-
dertaking further park and recreation develop-
ment and will manage important recreation
areas in the reservoir to meet local needs.

National Park Service—Under authority of
the Act of August 25, 1916, as amended, the
National Park Service administers national parks,
monuments, historic sites and other areas com-
prising the national park system under federal
ownership. These areas may be considered as
great outdoor museums. Recreation facilities and
activities provided by the service include the
areas themselves, information stations, hiking and
riding trails, fishing, camping and an interpretive
program of guided walks or automobile caravans,
campfire lectures, museums and other exhibits
and publications. Concessioners provide accom‘
modations such as hotels, lodges, cabins, restau—
rants, refreshment stands, saddle and pack trips,
sightseeing tours, ski runs, rental boats and boat
rides and entertainment of various kinds for their

139

guests. Available for public use of the areas are
some. 5,000 miles of road, 6,900 miles of trails,
7.300 mmpground spaces, and 140 hotels, lodges,
tent and cabin areas, with a total of 8,746 rooms
which will accommodate 21,566 persons. Most
of the basic facilities used by the concessioners
are provided by them through the investment of
private capital, though rates and services are con-
trolled hy the National Park Service to protect
the public.

One of the unique public services provided by
the National Park Service is that of interpretation.
In the scenic-scientific areas, naturalists present
programs of guided trips and lectures. Similar
programs are presented to visitors by trained
historians in the historic areas. Museum facili-
ties and technical and pOpular publications sup-
plement the personal services of the historians and
naturalists whose program objective is greater
public appreciation of America’s cultural heritage
of natural and historical features.

Included in the National Park System are the
National Capital Parks of \Vashington, D. C.,
and vicinity.

The service also manages four reservoir rec-
reation areas of national significance, such as Lake
Mead Recreational Area in Arizona-Nevada and
Coulee Dam Recreational Area in the State of
Washington, under cooperative agreements with
other federal agencies that hold basic jurisdiction.

The Act of June 23, 1936 authorizes the service
to make, a comprehensive study of the public
park, parkway and recreational-area programs in
the United States, and to cooperate with other
federal, state and local agencies in planning for
their park, parkway and recreational-area pro-
grams. Insofar as limited funds and personnel
will permit, the service acts in a consulting ca-
pacity to the states, upon their request.

Establishment of the United States Travel
Division as a unit of the National Park Service
was authorized by Act of July 19, 1940 for the
purpose of promoting and developing travel with-
in the United States, its territories and possessions
in cooperation with other public and private travel
agencies. The activities of this division were sus-
pended'during the war, but were resumed begin-
ning July 1, 1947.

Fish and Wildlife Service—This consists of
the former Bureau of Fisheries, established in
1(71 in the Department of Commerce, and the
Bureau of Biological Survey, established in 1885
in the Department of Agriculture. In 1939, both
bureaus were transferred to the Department of
the Interior and in 1940 were consolidated to form

140

the present organization.

The service, in addition to its research respon-
sibilities, is charged with carrying out the provi-
sions of laws designed to increase and protect
the 5311 and wildlife resources, disseminate
knowledge and extend the use of these resources,
and enforce federal game laws. Incident to these
responsibilities, the service has recognized the
necessity and desirability of providing, when not
inconsistent with these primary objectives, facili-
ties and services for recreation.

As an important part of the over-all program,
it administers 281 National Wildlife Refuges in
the continental United States, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico and Alaska. In the broadest sense, these
refuges make their greatest contribution to the
nation’s recreation in the production and protec—
tion of wildlife, particularly migratory water-
fowl, thus assuring the millions of hunters the
perpetuation of the sport of hunting. The more
tangible contributions which the refuges make to
recreation are the facilities available on such
areas for fishing, camping, boating, picnicking,
nature study and related activities.

On areas which lend themselves to recreation
uses without involved development and construc—
tion, the facilities are provided by the service.
On others, the recreation facilities are deveIOped
and operated either in cooperation with local
governmental or civic groups or by commercial
concessioners. The former includes the operation
of some 101 game fish hatcheries ,throughout the
country at which millions of iingerlings are
annually distributed directly, and through state
cooperation, to stock and restock fishing waters.

Migratory waterfowl are a continental resource
of great recreation importance to American
sportsmen. Out of the total of 282 wildlife refuges
administered today by the Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice, 196 of these, with a total of 3,122,231 acres
of marsh and water habitat, are dedicated to
waterfowl production and protection.

All forms of wildlife are protected—from the
big bull moose to the smallest songbird. The big
game refuges of the service are particularly im-
portant with the attendant preservation of game
in danger of vanishing from this country, such as
American bison, prong-horned antelope, moun-
tain sheep, deer, buffalo, elk, Rocky Mountain
white-tailed deer and so on. Many areas have
been especially established for the conservation
of one or more species—196 (3,122,231 acres)
for migratory waterfowl; 48 (91,212 acres) for
colonial nongame birds; 16 (10,652,248 acres)
for big game; and 21 (4,221,611 acres) for

RECREATION

migratory birds other than waterfowl and mis-
cellaneous forms of wildlife.

Forest Service—One hundred fifty na-
tional forests, with a net area of 180,000,000
acres, are managed by the Forest Service so as to
conserve and utilize the resources of the lands
for the public welfare. Areas in national forests
which are primarily valuable for recreation are
developed or are reserved for future deve10pment.

The national forests received 26,080,255 rec-
reation visits during 1949, an increase ‘of nine
per cent over 1948. Recreation facilities and
areas available to the public include:

1. 4,537 improved camp and picnic grounds
occupying 52,729 acres with a normal capacity
fpr 280,000 people at one time.

2. 206 improved swimming areas.

3. 236 winter sports areas, occupying 80,000
acres and with a capacity for 200,000 skiers at
one time. 'Most_of these are equipped with‘ipri~
vately-owned ski tows and lifts, operated under
special use permit.

4. 400 organization camps.

5. 505 hotels and resorts.

In addition, approximately 55,000,000 motor-
ists used national forest highways primarily to en-
joy forest environment and scenery during 1949.

With the exception of certain restrictions on a
few national forests during fire season, the entire
national forest area is open to the public, and a
substantial portion of the recreation use is on
areas which have not been set aside primarily
for recreation.

The Forest Service encourages types of recre-
ation appropriate to the forest environment, such
as camping, picnicking, swimming, skiing, hiking,
riding, hunting and fishing and, whenever finan-
cially possible, develops the basic facilities neces-
sary for such recreation. The service permits
other government agencies and semi-public
organizations to construct recreation facilities on
national forest lands.

Most of the public facilities made available for
the recreationist in the national forests are main-
tained and supervised directly by employees of
' the Forest Service. Facilities such as resorts,
stores, gas stations and so on are provided by
private capital and operated by private citizens
under use permits. Services and facilities of this
type are encouraged where public need exists.

Extension Service—The concerns of this ser-
ice cover cooperative extension work between the
land-grant agricultural colleges of the states and
the United States Department of Agriculture.
Many people who live in our larger cities are not

JUNE 1950

aware of the immense amount of recreation pro-
moted by this organization for the many families
that reside in rural America.

Extension work consists of an educational pro-
gram designed to assist farm people in improving
agriculture, marketing and distribution of farm
products, homemaking and rural life in general.

Strictly speaking, the recreation work of the
Extension Service should be thought of as mostly
that of state nature rather than of a federal agen-
cy. Recreation in extension is administered by
the several state extension services which are
connected with the respective state agricultural
colleges. Yet about forty-eight per cent of the
funds expended by the states for all their exten-
sion work is derived from federal appropriations.
Increasing development through the years of

.recreation progress by state and county extension

services, in response to the demand from local
pe0ple, has led to a sufficiently broad interpreta-
tion of these laws to include recreation.

 

National Park Service

Yosemite is example of scenic grandeur in national
parks. They embrace wilderness, natural wonders.

Extension personnel also help rural people ana-
lyze their recreation needs and work out recre-
ation programs for their own communities and
counties. Leadership training meetings or insti-
tutes, where 4-H club leaders, school teachers,
ministers, and leaders of Granges and other local
groups can go to learn how to conduct and de-
velop recreational activities for their own respec-
tive local organizations, are held by state or
county extension services throughout the country.
Extension workers in recreation cooperate with

schmls, farm organizations and other agencies in
conducting local, county or state recreation pro-
grams or events. Folk festivals and recreation
institutes are held annually in a number of states
and counties under sponsorship or with the co-
operation of the Extension Service. Local com-
munity volunteer leaders, functioning under the
supervision of the county agent or his assistant,
have charge of these extension projects. Leaders
are trained by states in conferences and camps.

The several state extension services and the
federal office c00perate with other governmental
agencies, church bodies, schools, educational
associations, recreational associations, colleges
and universities, and other groups interested in
developing or improving the recreation life of
rural areas. The National Recreation Association
and other private agencies are often called upon
by federal, state and county extension services
for technical assistance.

Office of Education—Education touches the
lives of all people at one time or another, directly
or indirectly, and one of the objectives of educa-
tion is the training for the wise use of leisure
time. Therefore, the Offlce of Education has al—
ways been concerned with the recreation respon-
sibilities of educational systems. Their specific
objectives include that of helping public school

RECREATION

systems to be of maximum service to their com-
munities in meeting the recreational needs of
all the people.

Also, it is generally agreed today that some
educational activities carry over into recreation,
while recreation programs often are educational.
School recreation programs include activities
which can be continued in adult life, such as music,
arts and crafts, dramatics, tennis, golf, volley-
ball, nature projects. Recreation programs can
teach citizenship, democracy in action, an under—
standing of fair play and of other nationalities,
races and creeds.

In the realm of school-community recreation,
the Office of Education cooperates with federal
and national agencies in an endeavor to integrate
school recreation programs with these and other
groups.

Its recreation specialists influence recreation in
the schools throughout the country by:

Providing training courses for leaders.

Holding workshops and institutes.

Being represented in many national organiza-
tions interested in recreation and related fields,
and attending annual conferences of these organi-
zations.

Holding individual and group conferences with
people seeking recreation information.

Working with other government bureaus.

Corresponding with pe0ple throughout the
nation.‘ ,

Issuing leaflets, periodicals, bulletins, news
items and helping in other ways.

The Office of Education also promotes the in-
clusion of recreation leadership training in the
curriculum of institutions of higher learning, and
seeks to stimulate and improve the service of state
departments of education in the field of recre-
ation and to integrate the school-community rec-
reation point of view.

Adult education programs not only include rec-
reation activities, but actually are recreation for
many of the adults participating. These become
a concern of the Office of Education as a part of a
community’s problem of providing adequate -edu-
cational and recreational opportunities for its
residents. The community cannot afford to over-
look the rich recreation resources of the public
school; and the school, correlatively, must under-
take the responsibility of increasing its service
to the community. The Office of Education can
help both the community and school in effectively
discharging these interrelated responsibilities.

Children’s Bureau—Since its early days, this
bureau has suggested ways in which communities

Play School: Association, New York

Recreation is often educational and vice versa. More
than clay modeling here—there’s social learning, too.

might provide recreation as well as other services
which would strengthen families in their task of
rearing children. In 1919, the White House Con-
ference and other meetings sponsored by the
bureau developed definite recommendations re-
garding the place of play in the life of a child.

Also, early in its history, it recommended
methods of securing recreation opportunities for
children, youth and families in congested urban
areas and sparsely settled rural areas, based on
actual studies of recreation facilities, leadership,
program and organization structure in particular
communities.

In all of its work in the recreation field, the
bureau follows a broad concept of recreation in-
clusive of the multiple interests of children and
youth in games, social recreation, arts, crafts,
music, drama and nature activities. It is also
implicit in all its efforts that recreation is not
an isolated factor in community life but related
to good housing, happy family life, adequate edu-
cational opportunities, and good physical and
mental health.

The bureau emphasizes the importance of com-
petent leadership, carefully selected and carefully
trained. It has given special attention to leader-
ship in working with youth, has advanced stand-
ards for the selection of the adult leaders and
for their adequate training, and has established
minimum criteria against which leisure-time ser-
vices may be evaluated.

Between 1925 and 1935, the bureau provided
staff to assist state welfare departments in the
training of personnel for recreation and group
leadership. Since 1935, in the strengthening of
state and local child-welfare programs under the
Social Security Act, the services of child-welfare
workers have been increasingly available to

143

children in the communities in which they live,
with local recreation resources being used as fully
as possible. Children living in institutions are also
a concern of child-welfare workers, and oppor-
tunity for voluntary play and participation in
clubs is considered an essential feature of the
total effort to help the child build a feeling of
security and adjust himself to the special condi-
tions under which he lives.

In looking forward to the Midcentury Confer-
ence on Children and Youth to be held in 1950,
the bureau recognizes that attention must be given
to those recreation and leisure-time services which
help children and youth achieve positive growth
and adequacy in their homes,
jobs and their communities.

Public. Housing Adminis-
tration — This agency is

The President's Committee on

service agencies, for the provision of . . . rec-
reation facilities and services to meet the needs of
the residents of the development. It shall dis-
charge those responsibilities in such manner as
to promote the maximum application of the re-
sources of community service agencies in meet-
ing these needs. Where necessary facilities can-
not be provided by the local community service
agencies, the public housing agency shall provide
such facilities as a part of the development in
accordance with FHA Minimum Physical Re—
quirements.” '

The basic philosophy of PHA is to utilize exist-
ing facilities of the community in all areas where
such are available and where
the location of such facilities
are suitable for project use. In
selecting the site for a housing

tion of the following six hous-
ing programs:

2. Homes Conversion

3. Defense Homes Corpora-
tion

4. Veterans Re-use

5. Subsistence Homesteads
and Greenbelt Towns

6. Low-Rent Housing

Since all of the above pro-
grams, with the exception of
that of the low-rent housing,

Forces has been created by execu-
tive order "to encourage and pro-
mote the spiritual. moral and rec-
reational welfare and character

guidance of persons in the armed
forces. and thereby to enhance the
military preparedness and security

of the nation." This committee
has undertaken responsibility for a

program of the organization of.

and of the civilian communities

project, consideration is given
to existing facilities. Where
facilities are to be developed
in the project, minimum stand-
ards are established for indoor
and outdoor recreation areas.
Provision for necessary expen- _
ditures for maintenance and
upkeep of the facilities is
made by PHA only when it is
not possible to negotiate agree-
ments with local community
service agencies for these

costs. No funds are permitted
by PHA for direct leadership

are in various stages of dispo-
sition—projects being sold,
transferred to municipalities
and leases terminated—the
Public Housing Administration is shifting its em-
phasis on recreation activities to the low-rent
program. However, during the war period, rec-
reation activities in war housing projects were
stressed in order to provide the necessary recre-
ation requirements to permit capacity operation
of war industries. Numerous projects were so
remotely located that they required the building
of complete recreation facilities.

Policy determinations, requirements and stand-
ards established by PHA Central Office govern
the building and operation of projects by local
housing authorities. The following policy has

been established for the provision and operation
of recreation facilities:

"Local management shall be responsible for
planning, developing and maintaining working re-
lationships and agreements with local community

144

adjacent to them.

 

in recreation activities, but
local housing authorities can
make small expenditures for
miscellaneous items of equip*
ment and supplies. ‘

Since it is the policy of PHA to integrate, inso-
far as possible, the recreation activities of a.
housing project with those of a neighborhood or
a community, leadership is expected to include

the housing project as a unit of the neighbor—
hood or the community.

With joint planning“ communities become
cognizant of the fact that families living in hous-
ing projects are as much a part of the neighbor-
hood or the community as any other group of
families; thus greater benefits are derived by

project families from all of the community’s
services.

Bureau of Reclamation——With the National

Park Service acting as its agent, this agency plans.
for the protection and utilization of the recreation
resources of reclamation projects, and proposes

RECREATION

to develop appropriate recreation facilities.

For many years, the bureau has permitted fish-
ing, boating, picnicking, swimming, hiking and
similar activities on its reservoir areas and, in
some cases, has allowed private individuals to
camp, erect cabins and operate limited concession
facilities. Some of the recreation developments
have been operated by state or local agencies
under permit.

Since 1944, it has given special consideration to
recreational potentialities in all of its investiga—
tions of reservoir projects. The National Park
Service investigates and appraises the scenic,
scientific, historical, archeological and recreational
developments and other factors. It also considers
the impairment or destruction of existing recre-
ational values that might result from construction
of the reservoirs and other water-control struc-
tures. The Smithsonian Institution assists the
park service in archeological surveys and salvage
operations. The Fish and Wildlife Service in-
vestigates fish and wildlife aspects and makes
recommendations relating to fishing and hunting.
These recommendations are incorporated in the
bureau’s project reports so that proper considera-
tion may be given to the recreational aspects of
each project when the proposal is reviewed by
other federal and state agencies and by the Con-
gress. Except for the Missouri River Basin
project, for which funds are allotted by the bureau,
Congress now makes a direct appropriation
to the National Park Service for these river basin
studies. For several years, however, this work
was financed by the bureau.

For those areas where it has been determined
that recreation facilities should be provided, ex-
cept in the national forests, the National Park
Service prepares complete master plans, layout
plans and detailed working drawings for roads,
structures, plantings and so on, with funds ad-
vanced by the bureau.

Improvement of rivers, waterways and the creation of

U. S. D. A. Extension Service, photo by Ed. Hanson

Extension personnel help rural people work out rec-
reation programs. Many provide activities for families.

Except for the recreation areas and facilities
that will be administered by the National Park
Service or the Forest Service, it is expected that
most of these will eventually be administered by
appropriate state or local agencies. The National
Park Service, acting as agent for the bureau, will
then consult and negotiate with such agencies and
prepare agreements for suitable administration.

Additional Agencies

In addition to the activities of the above govern-
mental services, the programs of a number of
other agencies contribute to the recreation re-

.sources of the country. Among them are the

following :

Bureau of Indian Affairs—Provides limited
recreation opportunities for the public on Indian

lands, as well as facilities and programs for the
Indians themselves.

Bureau of Land Management—Makes avail-
able the use of the public lands for essentially all
forms of recreation. The bureau also has au-
thority to sell, lease or exchange to the states and
their political subdivisions unreserved non-mineral
lands which have been classified as chiefly valuable
for recreation purposes.

The National Capital Park and Planning

Connnission—Plans and acquires an adequate

system of parks, parkways and playgrounds to
preserve the forest and natural scenery in and
about the national capital, and to prepare a co-
ordinated city and regional plan for the District
of Columbia and environs.

Federal Security Agency—The Public Health
Service furnishes information on sanitary prob-
lems relating to construction and operation of

14S

park recreation developments, such as swimnung
pools, camps and beaches. ;

Public Roads Administration—Cooperates
with the National Park Service and the Forest
Service in constructing roads on areas under the
jurisdiction of these services. As a considerable
part of the national use of all public roads is
estimated to be for recreation purposes, the total
program of this agency has an important bearing
on the recreation of the people.

Bureau of Community Facilities—Adminis-
ters federal grants and aids made in connection

with the defense and war program for recreation
facilities and services to local communities. It also
disposes of recreation properties to local and
federal governmental agencies.

Soil Conservation Service—Has set aside and
developed recreation areas in connection with its
land utilization projects.

Tennessee Valley Authority—Assists state
and local governments within its area of opera-
tion to plan and organize a number of demon-
stration parks, most of which are transferred to
state or local agencies for administration.

Reereatienal Use of Water Resources

CONCERN FOR THE adequate development of the
nation’s water resources for recreation has
increased in recent years, particularly because of
the Federal Government’s extensive program in
the creation of new water areas in connection
with flood control and power projects. Recently,
President Harry S. Truman appointed members
to the President’s Water Resources Policy Com-
mission. They include Morris L. Cook-—chair-
man, Gilbert F. White—vice chairman, and Paul
S. Burgess, Lewis Webster Jones, Samuel B.
Morris, Leland Olds and Roland R. Renne.
The chairman of the commission has invited the
National Recreation Association, along with other
interested national _organizations, to submit a
statement outlining the association’s recommen—
dations as to what the basic policy for the rec—
reational use of the nation’s water resources
should include. In response to this invitation,
Joseph Prendergast, Executive Director of the
association, wrote the following to Mr. Cooke.
“The National Recreation Association has long

146

been interested in the fullest possible use of all
land and water areas for the recreation of the
people. It has cooperated with various federal
government agencies from time to time, including
the assignment of a staff member to work with
the National Resources Board at the time it made
its study of federal water resources and recom-
mended a policy for their utilization. At special
meetings during recent National Recreation
Congresses sponsored by the association, rec-
reation leaders from all over the country have met
with representatives of the Corps of Engineers
and other federal agencies to discuss recreational
use of water areas . .

“The Federal Government has a direct and
large responsibility for the provision of certain
types of recreation areas . . .”

The Federal Inter-Agency Committee on Rec-
reation has accepted the request of the President’s
Water Resources Policy Commission to act as its
subcommittee, and to prepare a report on recrea-
tion as related to the nation’s water resources.

Recreation Facilities and Serviees
0i Fear Federal Agencies*

THE following table indicates the recreation fa-
cilities and services provided by four federal
agencies: the Corps of Engineers, Department of
the Army; the Forest Service, Department of
Agriculture; the Fish and Wildlife Service, De-
partment of the Interior; and the National Park
Service, Department of the Interior. The table
illustrates the extent to which these federal agen-
cies have been authorized to provide a variety of
recreation facilities and activities. In addition to
those provided directly by these four agencies,
many facilities and services are furnished under
agreement with them by other governmental agen-
cies or commercial concessioners.

In the table that follows, the headings “Author-
ized,” “Status,” and “Should Be Done” are to be
interpreted as follows. They do not indicate a
priority.

A utlrorized means that the agency is authorized

 

'Adapted from “The Role of the Federal Government in the Field
of Public Recreation," issued by the Federal Inter-Agency Committee
on Recreation, June, 1949.

 

to provide or permit the facility or activity on
appropriate areas. For instance, restaurants may
be authorized, but would not be built or per-
mitted on areas needed for higher priority use.

Being Done means that the facility or activity
is being provided in accordance with present au-
thorization and practice.

Adequater Done means that the facilities or
activities provided are sufficient to meet the present
need. If the agency reports that an activity should
not be done, no symbol appears under this heading.

Should Be Done means that the agency believes
that the facility or activity should be provided in
appropriate areas.

In the table that follows, “E” represents the
Corps of Engineers; “F,” the Forest Service;
“P,” national parks and other areas of the Na-
tional Park System; “R,” Reservoir Recreation

Areas administered by the National Park Service;

SINCE-2 ITS FOL‘NDING in 1906, the NatiOnal Rec-
reation Association has helped in the promo-
tion of recreation in other lands. Increasingly, its
services have been extended to all corners of the
earth and its publications have influenced the de-
velopment of recreation. In many cases, the
association has set a pattern for similar organiza-
tions in other countries. Foreign visitors seek-
ing to gain a picture of recreation in the United
States invariably call at the association’s head-
quarters. Frequently, in addition to information
and literature, they are given guidance in plan-
ning itineraries of travel and are helped to get in
touch with persons and agencies in the cities that
can make their visits most profitable. Letters
from individuals and organizations seeking advice,
information and literature on recreation subjects
reach the association in large numbers.

A summary of such NRA services—entitled
“Intemationally Speaking”*—was published in the
September 1948 issue of RECREATION. This told
the story of the part the association has played
in the foreign picture. It included a world map
indicating the areas and countries receiving pub-
lications and service during a recent four-year
period and showing the world-wide contacts of the
association. Reference was also made to the First
International Recreation Congress held in Los
Angeles in 1932, which was organized by the
association with the cooperation of an advisory
committee on which thirty-three countries were
represented.

Since the end of the Second World War, in-
terest in recreation has been manifested to a
greater degree than ever before in many foreign
countries. Their requests for help cover such mat-
ters as the deveIOpment of centers for youth and
for community groups of all ages; city planning
for recreation; the design and equipment of parks,
recreation areas and facilities; the development of
sports programs and of physical recreation activi-
ties. The destruction of recreation libraries in
war-torn areas resulted in numerous requests for
recreation publications. Leaders considering the
establishment of a national recreation movement

or asssociation have come to the headquarters
ofhce or have written letters seeking information
as to the origin, organization and services of the
NRA.

The results and values of National Recreation
Association assistance in such instances reveal
themselves in the healthy growth of recreation in
all parts of the world, and in letters of apprecia-
tion and encouraging reports received at the
association office.

A complete account of these services and rela-
tionships cannot be presented here. The following
list of typical inquiries, however, reveals major
recreation interests and significant developments,
and points out some of the recreation aims and
objectives of leaders throughout the world. It
affords a supplement to “Internationally Speak-
ing,” mentioned previously.

Occupied Countries

Recreation has play‘ed a fundamental role in
plans for restoring the occupied countries to a
peacetime basis and in fostering democratic ideals
among these peoples. Personnel of the occupa-
tion forces and local organizations under their
sponsorship, as well as native leaders, have turned
repeatedly to the NRA for assistance. Quantities
of literature have been sent at the request of such
groups as the German Office of Youth Activities
and the Group Activities Branch of the Office of
Military Government in Germany, the Free Youth
Association and German Youth Centers and of
comparable groups in Japan. These publications
have been translated into German by the Civil
Affairs Division and the Education and Religious
Affairs Branch of the Military Government and
by the Japanese Government.

The association has assisted the German Youth
Activities Office by helping arrange for local rec-
reation authorities in the United States to co-
operate in its “Youth Helps Youth” project,
whereby young people in Germany became ac-
quainted with American boys and girls through
correspondence. NRA workers have actively co-
operated with the German Leadership ProjectT

sponsored by the National Welfare Assembly and
involving the planning of visits for more than 125
German leaders who are interested in American
community recreation. Governmental agencies
have been assisted by the personnel department of
the association in recruiting recreation leaders for
service with the armed forces and for youth ser—
vices in the occupied areas. Reports received from
Japan indicate the exceptional revival of recreation
in that country.

Austria—The chief, Public Welfare, Education
and Youth Activities Department, United States
Army in upper Austria wrote: “A major part of
our work here involves the promotion of activities
for Austrian young people in the form of youth
centers, summer camps, playgrounds under com—
bined American and Austrian sponsorship . . .
Two youth centers have been organized to serve
as a demonstration for further expansion to the
other cities.” He requested assistance in securing
publications “to aid us in guiding the develop-
ment of public recreation, youth activities and lay
leadership in Austria.” Among other things, he
asked for a subscription to RECREATION.

Germany—A group of American wives, spon-
soring a German girls’ program, requested suitable
material. Another requested information on the
construction of playground apparatus for an out—
door playground at a post school, planned for
pre-school children and being established by a
women’s club.

A representative of the Intelligence Division of
H.I.C.O.G. requested plans and specifications for
the construction of simple playground apparatus
for use on a playground. This, arranged with the
Berlin city authorities, is to be equipped and su-
pervised by an international work camp this
summer. '

Japan—The president and the advisor of the
Japan National Recreation Association, both of
whom attended the International Recreation Con—
gress in 1932, called to discuss plans for. the newly
reorganized Japan association. NRA experience
was shared with them and, in addition, they were
given much material on programs, especially for
youth and for rural communities. Later, a mem-
ber of the board of directors of their association,
while in New York with a delegation from the
Japanese Diet, received help with plans to observe
recreation facilities in this country.

An official of the National Prison of Japan, in
charge of education and recreation for prisoners,
reported experiments in the deve10pment of pro-
grams for the inmates of the prisons and reforma-
tories, and requested information that would be

useful in this worknas well as in youth and scout-
ing activities. Another letter, from the National
Committee of YMCA’s of Japan, brought a re-
quest for material to help in developing a national
program of recreation for the National Prison
Association and for the school that specializes in
training for seamanship.

One of the founders of the Tokyo Playground
Association, who is in charge of the training of
the kindergarten leaders, while studying in the
United States, called to renew a former contact
with the association: She was given literature,
information and help in planning visits to a num-
ber of American cities.

The chief of the Social Research Department
of Public Welfare in Osaka, who visited the NRA
office in 1936, wrote of plans “to establish a new
committee to promote citizens’ recreation, spon-
sored by the municipality and managed by private
citizen leaders.” After acknowledging receipt of
material he said: “Making available these precious
reference data for the better management of muni-
cipal recreation work, I have translated them into
Japanese and am now distributing them free of
charge among public service officials and private
social work leaders concerned with recreation
work.”

The physical education officer of the Civil In—
formation and Education Section of the Army
wrote that the recreation program for the Japa-
nese peOple had been made one of his assignments.
He requested information on many subjects -—
for use “in launching our campaign.”

The British Commonwealth

Rapid strides in the development of recreation
were made in several of the nations in the British
Commonwealth between the two world wars, and
significant advances have been reported during the
last few years. Interest in physical recreation,
city planning for recreation and the development
of community centers is especially keen. Evidence
indicates that recreation in these countries was
stimulated, and recreational habits influenced, by
the American troops stationed there in large
numbers during the war.

Australia—The Commonwealth fitness officer
of the Department of Health called to secure in-
formation about the NRA and the organization
and administration of recreation in the United
States. Since the Commonwealth of Australia
appropriates funds for physical recreation, some
of which are available to provinces and munici-
palities, information also was sought on local,
state and federal relationships. Suggestions were

offered as to places in the United States which
might be visited.

Several requests for information have been re-
ceived from the Recreation and Leadership Move-
ment for use in a study school on community
recreation. The organization was interested in
studying the principles of the recreation move—
ment in the United States, leadership standards
and the National Recreation Congress.

The assistant city engineer in Sydney visited
this country to observe the design and construc—
tion of all types of recreation areas and facilities.
He discussed planning problems with planning
specialists on the NRA staff and was given in—
formation on the functions of the association, city

planning for recreation and the training of play-

ground leaders.
The director of the Australian YMCA College

came to the association recently to get help and
suggestions for the organization of a National
Recreation Association of Australia. He was also
interested in finding out the present status and
future plans for an international recreation con-
gress.

Canada—The association cooperates closely
with recreation leaders in Canada. Members of
the staff have prepared plans for recreation areas
and buildings in several Canadian cities and have
participated in several of their national recreation
meetings. Association specialists have also con-
ducted recreation training institutes for Canadian
leaders; and requests for literature are filled.

Ceylon—The chief playground instructor in
Colombo, in making a study of playgrounds and
recreation in the United States, requested in-
formation as to places he might visit and related
problems.

England—The director of the National Fed-
eration of Community Associations, seeking a de-
tailed picture of community center development
here, asked for specific information relating to
types of centers, their organization, financial sup-
port, relationships and programs.

The Save the Children Fund, proposing to erect
a demonstration junior club and playground in a
crowded London district, asked for help. Also,
the secretary of one of the oldest settlements in
London requested information for use in a study
of what new type of organization can reach the
delinquent or near—delinquent boy who is not be—
ing served effectively by existing agencies. He
also wanted to know about youth programs.

Literature and information on a variety of sub-
jects have been exchanged with the Officer for
Overseas Work, Central Council of Physical

Education, which publishes the monthly, “Physi-
cal Recreation”.

India—The Labor Welfare Department, Bom-
bay, requested literature on playground and rec-
reation activities and catalogues of play equip-
ment to help in the development and operation

of playgrounds attached to labor welfare centers
run by the government.

The worker in charge of Juvenile Aid Work
under the Indian Government, which was taking

over the service formerly rendered by the Chil-
dren’s Aid Society, called to learn about the work
of the NRA and its relation to local, state and
federal agencies. He was given letters of intro-
duction to recreation executives in several cities.

RECREATION

The newly appointed planning engineer for the
Telephone and Telegraph Workshops of the
Indian Government called to learn about asso-
ciation work and publications for he felt that a
similar movement should be undertaken in India.
Since returning to his own country, he has been
active in promoting such a movement.

New Zealand—The chairman of a community
center association in Wellington requested in-
formation on community centers, youth centers,
publicity and finance to help in its own center and
in the promotion of six others.

Scotland—The honorable secretary of the
Aberdeen Old PeOple’s Welfare Council asked
for ideas on recreation for the elderly for the first
club of this kind to be Opened in the city —— in a
large remodeled garage. He stated: “The ulti-
mate aim of the council is to establish others.”

The Southwest Scotland Electricity Board
wrote: “We have in this country little guidance
on the important question of how to organize and
integrate the social activities of the employees of

an industry.” He asked for advice and literature.
Trinidad—The social welfare field officer of

the Trinidad—Tobago Welfare Limited asked for
literature on recreation, gymnastics and com-
munity singing to be used in the promotion of
recreation in rural clubs.

Union of South Africa—The director of the
Social Welfare Department in Johannesburg, -in
considering the establishment of community
centers, requested information relating to plan-
ning, financing, management and operation. Later,
many questions were asked as to what policies
are adopted in this country in relation to the use
of such centers by various organizations.

The senior supervisor of play centers in the
same city spent approximately a year in the
United States studying recreation methods, pro-
grams and so on, with special interest in music,
camping and activities for underprivileged
children. The association helped with her itinerary
of travel, provided her with letters of introduction
and welcomed her at the National Recreation Con-
gress.

The secretary-organizer of the Donaldson
Orlando Community Center in the same city re-
quested literature and information regarding rules
for indoor.and outdoor games for use in clubs.

The secretary of the Playing Fields Association
in Port Elizabeth wrote: “I am anxious to obtain
all the information regarding similar organizations
in other parts of the world.” He stated that for the
time being the chief task is to encourage local au-

thorities to do their part in establishing commu-

IUNE 1950

nity recreation facilities, but that with the Cape-
town Association, his organization hoped eventu-
ally to have a National Playing Fields Association
functioning in every part of South Africa.

Other Nations

Belgium—The chief inspector, Physical Edu-
cation, Sports and Outdoor Activities in the
Ministry of Public Health, requested information
and literature on recreation, parks, swimming
pools and athletic fields. This was to be used in
the job of examining and advising on requests
for government grants for the construction of rec-
reation facilities, and of controlling subsidies for
operation of recreation areas and sports federa-
tions.

The director of ,Social Service in Antwerp, in
writing for information, stated: “We here in Bel-
gium are only at the beginning of a new concep-
tion in educational matters and are trying to
create a service that can give help to the young-
sters.” He later requested permission to trans-
late several publications for educational use.

Cl1ina--—The 'general secretary of the YWCA
in Nanking, China, in the United States under
the United Nations fellowship program, sought
information as to leadership training methods,
college and university courses and ways of or-
ganizing, financing and conducting community
recreation programs.

An American worker in a Chinese Christian
Mission requested material which she could use
as director of recreation for Chinese children and
in teaching a group of young men to direct play-
ground activities in their local schools.

France-‘A representative of the Sports and
Physical Education Division of the Ministry of
Education,"‘ who was spending a year here for
study and observation, desired full information
regarding the association and the deveIOpment of
recreation nationally, eSpecially its relation to
education and volunteer agencies. His interest in
recreation resulted from observation of its
demonstrated value during a live-year period in
a prisoner-of-war camp.

Greece—The playground director, Near East
Foundation in Athens, was sent a comprehensive
set of literature to replace his library lost in the
war and also other information on a variety of
subjects. The Athens Playground, developed
with the help of the NRA, was taken over by
German troops during the war, but was returned
to its proper use in 1949.

respondence course, called to express gratitude.

A representative of Children to Palestine asked
help in planning provision of a playground in each

greatly in need of such services. These children
have either lost their ability to play or never had
an opportunity because of the years spent in con-
centration or displaced persons’ camps.

Netherlands -— The Planning Department,

desirable for the residents of twelve camp com—
munities operated by the company. He was es-

pecially interested in the design and equipment

various types including those for women’s groups.

RECREATION

Canada

“No ONE CAN survey the social
scene in Canada today without be-
ing impressed by the rapid growth
of the recreation movement, es-
pecially in its public sector.” This statement, by
the Canadian Welfare Council in its annual report
for 1949, is substantiated by the many evidences
of widespread interest in recreation in Canada
during recent years. The variety and diversity of
public and private agencies that are providing
recreation at the local, provincial and Dominion
level make it extremely difficult to give in a brief
statement an accurate picture of recreation in

Canada today.
National Agencies—The Parks and Recreation

Association of Canada includes in its membership
park and recreation authorities in municipalities
from coast to coast; and it is representative of
many interested organizations. Among its ser-
vices are the publication of a bulletin, “Young
Canada,” and a quarterly magazine, “Parks and
Recreation in Canada,” the holding of a national
convention and a consultation service. It pro-
vides a medium for the exchange of ideas and
experience among the recreation leaders of the
Dominion.

The Physicial Fitness Division of the Depart-
ment of National Health and Welfare in Ottawa,
under a physical fitness act, makes available for
the promotion of a fitness and recreation pro—
gram a sum of $250,000 annually. The division
issues an “Information Bulletin,” other publica-
tions such as a “Guide for Leaders in Community
Recreation,” arranges conferences, produces films
and provides consultation service to localities. In
1949 it convened a national conference of sports
governing bodies. The provinces participating in
its program match the Dominion grants dollar for
dollar and relay the funds on to the municipalities
on a similar matching basis.

The National Parks Bureau, which administers
some of the most magnificent scenic areas in
Canada for the recreational use of the people, has
appointed a recreation director. 'The Recreation

Division of the Canadian \Velfare Council, which

guide developments in the recreation field. Other
national agencies concerned with recreation are
the Canadian Citizenship Council, the Canadian
Association for Adult Education, the Canadian
Camping Association, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation and the National Film Board.
“Youth and Recreation,” issued by the Canadian
Youth Commission, contains an analysis of provi—
sions for recreation in Canada and recommenda-
tions for making them more effective. Voluntary
agencies such as the YMCA provide many forms
of recreation service.

have appointed advisory councils to help in de-
veloping effective recreation programs. The
Province of Ontario has its own program, operated
under the Department of Education, with grants-
in-aid to municipalities. Some seventy com-
munities have set up local recreation commissions
which are participating in the scheme. The
Saskatchewan Recreation Movement ‘functions

The importance of recreation as a major re-
source was recognized at the third annual British
t‘ultnnbia Natural Resources Conference, held
early in 1050. At this meeting, a recreation com—
mittee on which public and private agencies were
represented submitted a comprehensive report on
problems of recreation resource utilization. Among

t0pics covered were: the relative significance of
recreation; methods of estimating present and fu-
ture recreation needs; the relative significance of
various forms of recreation; the allocation of re-
sources to specific recreation uses and their pro-
tection; and the recreation resource-use problem
of municipalities, clubs and organized groups.

Municipal recreation programs, varying in na-
ture and extent and under various local auspices,
have been established in hundreds of communities
in Canada. According to the secretary of the
Parks and Recreation Association of Canada,
$13,000,000 was spent by park and recreation
departments at the municipal level in 1948, most
of it for activity programs provided by recre-
ation, park and school boards. About 200 com-
munities and counties employ full-time recreation
directors; somewhere around 2,000 full—time rec—
reation workers and an estimated 40,000—50,000
volunteers serve the public recreation movement.*
Several universities and special schools have made
a beginning in the development of training courses
for recreation leaders.

Major emphasis in some cities is upon the
building and operating of a civic recreation
center; in many others, recreation programs are
operated at playgrounds and in school buildings.
In Quebec, recreation programs are primarily
initiated and operated by church bodies rather
than by local authorities, and the parish hall is
the recreation center in many communities. Sup—
plementing the recreation programs provided by
governmental agencies are the services rendered
primarily on a membership basis by such agencies
as Y’s, SCouts, Guides and service clubs. The
need for coordination of recreation agencies and
for c00perative planning for recreation is recog—
nized as a major problem by many leaders in
this country.

THEIR LANGUAGE IS different; their costumes
and customs inspire the visits of interested
tourists: their foods are a source of inviting dis-

covery — but how foreign are the ways of their .

leisure-time pursuits? If the traveler to Pan
-\merican countries anticipates very obvious con-
trasts here, too, for the most part, he will be
quite disappointed!

The people of Pan American countries enjoy
their recreation generally in the same manner as
the citizens of the United States. 'Any differences
found are usually based on historical, cultural and
climactic factors, as well as on general economic
conditions. For example, within the countries
themselves, there is some distinction between the
recreation enjoyed in larger cities or capitals and
that usually found in the small towns, villages
and rural areas, which still have many traces of
earlier cultures.

The amount of leisure time available to the
farmers and the small town dwellers is not large.
The farmer or the peon works from sun-up to
sun-down, and his recreation, such as it is, is en—
joyed on Saturdays and Sundays. On Saturday,
while at the market, he will engage in one of the
most popular forms of recreation —— conversation
with friends, neighbors and acquaintances. Often,
in the evening, after work has been done on some
cooperative or community project, there may be
a great feast, combined with singing and dancing.

But recreation in the larger cities is somewhat
more sophisticated and “EurOpean,” and more
leisure time is available. Among spectator as well
as participant sports, soccer is probably the most

burs enjoy their leisure hours?

popular, with baseball gaining favor in the coun-
tries closest to the United States, and regular
bullfights attracting great crowds. Tennis is as
common here as in the states, and many cities
offer country clubs with golf, tennis courts, swim-
ming pools and other excellent facilities.

In Chile, the seashores and countrysides feature
hiking, swimming, boating and sailing and the
various country clubs. During the winter, crowds
of young peOple leave for refugios to ski in the
snowy Andes. The enthusiasm for cycling, foot-
ball and basketball is reflected in the annual na-
tional and international sports matches.

The wonderland of Brazil — boasting forty-

eight million inhabitants and the only Portuguese-
speaking country in the hemispherewis consid-
ered a fisherman’s “paradise”. Lakes, rivers,
and the Atlantic Ocean abound in endless varieties
of fish. Game is abundant also, both large and
small. “Big game” hunters usually go to Mato
Grosso for jaguar, puma, tapir, wild pig, arma-
dillo, ostriches, crocodiles and giant storks.
Facilities for various sports are found at all the
leading resorts. Horse racing and automobile
races are major events in Rio, and boxing and
wrestling draw enthusiasts everywhere.
I Most of these spectator and. participant sports
'-——plus such activities as deep-sea fishing, cock-
fights, the Basque game of jai-alai—are also part
of the recreation of the citizens of, and visitors
to, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Venezuela and
Colombia.

Buenos Aires, the most populous Latin
American city with its 3,371,000 inhabitants, and

RECREATION

capital of Argentina, second largest nation in
South America, is considered the center for lovers
of sports and of the arts. Parque Palermo, the
city’s largest and most favored park, has beauti-
ful grounds which extend over more than 90,000
acres. Within them are walks, roads and bridle
paths, lake gardens and an outdoor theater, as
well as a racetrack, polo fields and a golf course.
The area also contains the Zoological and Botan-
ical Gardens and the grounds of the Argentine
Rural Society. The city has several other beau-
tiful parks as well. The federal capital, is, para-
doxically, one of the most congested cities in Latin
America and, at the same time, one of the most
spacious. *Many green areas near the center of
the city and private clubs along the ,river shore
provide portefios with recreation facilities; never-
theless, the creation of more open space in over-
crowded sections is the aim of the city’s planners.

Recreation is to be combined with transporta-
tion at the ultra-modern National Airport at
Ezeiza. Only 6,500 acres of the total 17,300 are
devoted to the airport project. Plans for the rest
of the area call for four huge swimming pools,
already completed, a large children’s camp for
youthful Argentine vacationers, and a model
village, outfitted in every detail, for airport em—
ployees. About three and a half million trees are
being planted on this national playground.

Another popular recreation place of Buenos
Aires is a park made of reclaimed land. It offers
gardens, restaurants, an open-air theater, roller-
skating and dancing. In addition, since Argen-
tineans have such a great interest in sports, the
capital and its environs possess the usual first-
.class facilities for summer sports, but soccer and
polo rule supreme.

As far back as 1931 an article appeared in
RECREATION magazine (“The Argentineans at
Play,” by Weaver Pangburn, November issue)
which told of the Gym and Fencing Club of
Buenos Aires. At that time, the club was fifty
years old and had 20,000 members. Its initiation
fee was eight dollars and fifteen cents and annual
dues were twenty dollars. For this, members
could make use of its three buildings, located at
strategic points in the city, and its huge acreage
of playing fields for soccer, rugby, hockey, tennis,
basketball, children’s play and other activities. Mr.
Pangburn wrote: “To give examples of the play
space provided, there are twenty tennis courts,
seven basketball courts and ten fields for soccer
and rugby, plus two outdoor swimming pools, a
roller-skating rink, a large gymnasium, one of the
best medical offices in South America, electric

reducing apparatus, and five courts for pelota and
sare — Spanish games. The club admits persons
of all ages and both sexes. Consequently, many
of its activities are family affairs.”

Although sports have played a tremendous part
in the recreation lives of our neighbors to the
South, they have other interests as well -— the
arts, music, dancing, drama and other cultural
and educational activities.

Plays, concert‘s, folk-dance' programs, puppet
shows are scheduled on enumerable occasions.
Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, has a wealth of fine
museums and cultural institutions. A brilliant

opera season runs each year from March through

August ‘at the Municipal Theater, where Tos-
ca'nini first won acclaim as a conductor. A favorite
social affair of Caracas, capital of Venezuela, is
the Sunday morning band concert' in the plaza.
In the Argentine, orchestral, operatic, and ballet
performances of folklore music of the provinces,
showing both Spanish and Indian influences, and
the’tango are very popular. In Buenos Aires,'
concerts are presented by such musical organiza-
tions as the Wagnerian Association and the Phil-
harmonic and Symphonic Societies, the major
concert season running from 'May through
August. Classical and‘ modern music is particu-
larly loved in Chile, and concerts are given not
only in the theaters and opera houses, but also
in the schools.as part of the children’s education.
Music from other countries has added a cosmo-
politan flavor to Chilean dancing.

Religious life and religious events are also an
important aspect of recreation in both the large
and small cities of Pan American countries. The
religious fiestas of a Saint’s Day are celebrated
with great fervor and at much expense and
energy. Each Mexican village annually honors its
patron saint with festivities, and since there are
as many saints as there are days in the year,
one may say it’s always fiesta time in Mexico.

The youngsters of Pan America indulge in
many of the activities enjoyed by their elders but,
like boys and girls everywhere, they prefer their
own games, singing as they play and often making
up words as they go along to suit the occasion.
Many of their games are the same as those of
the United States. The kite is extremely popular
—— even more so than here—and is called “e1
cometa” (the comet). When a boy wants to show
his artistic taste, he ornaments his kite with a
fringe of tissue paper around the bottom; and,
if he is musical, he extends the sticks above the
paper at the top and stretches straps of hide
across them. In a strong breeze, this gives a

t'hildren may also avail themselves of the many
games and activities planned for them in the parks
and on the playgrounds of their cities and towns.
The Department of Commerce of Latin America

reports that, so far as known, the first playground '

with imported equipment was established '° in
Mexico City in 1921. Equipment valued at about
$3.000 was installed in a central park as the gift
of the American colony. In 1928, the local Rotary
Clubs in Mexico began giving special attention to
the playground movement. Recreation grounds
were planned by them for Tampico, San Luis
Potosi and Piedras Negras, Coahuila. In 1929,
another report stated that the Mexican Depart-
ment of Education was starting to introduce phys-
ical exercise and Sports into the schools of Mexico.
It was preposed that athletic fields be established
in at least one thousand small towns during the
course of the year, in cooperation with local au-
thorities. It was understood that an attempt would
then be made to establish a thousand fields annu-
ally, with the typical American sports of football,
baseball, basketball and volleyball encouraged.

T he parks and playgrounds of Sao Paulo City,
Brazil, have been part of the program for beau-
tifying it for many years. In addition to those in
the residential districts, the largest and best
equipped parks and playgrounds have been
planned for the factory sections, where they can
benefit the children of poorer classes. ;[‘hey are
in charge of trained assistants and are open to
children from three to twelve years of age. Daily
attendance has ranged from 150 at the smallest
parks to 1.000 at the largest. When the munici-
pality decided to create playgrounds, it found it
necessary, before all, to modify the idea existing
with the majority of its population that play-
grounds are fields with shelters, porches and play-
ground apparatus where children play. To estab-
lish a truer conception, it decided to define play-
grounds as public parks where, through super-

~. d recreation, children are educated -——- giving
tne prrgram at the same time all the necessary
social assistance. Educational and recreational
activities it the Sao Paulo playgrounds include

162

and sailing. Above, Torpederas Beach at Valparaiso.

gymnastics, games, pageants, tournaments, con-
tests, clubs, music, singing, modeling, drawing,
handcrafts, trips, festivals and the provision of
library facilities. However, the essential charac-
teristic of the playgrounds has been the social
assistance ——- medical, dental and nutritional ~—
the municipality affords children of the slums.

The park equipment of Sao Paulo includes a
grassy lawn, a shelter with rooms for instructors
and the doctor and having showers and lavatories,
and a small tank and fountain for paddling. Also
among the outdoor equipment are swings, see-
saws, slides, turnabouts, and sandboxes. Games.
are taught, and teams have been organized for
competition with other parks and schools.

Bogota, Colombia, made news in 1948 with the
organization of its first modern playground. It is
a gift from a professor of the University of Cali-
fornia and will be used as a model for other play-
grounds which Colombia plans to build.

' Other Pan American countries boast several
playgrounds and parks; some, like Bogota, are
just starting to build; some, unfortunately, are
still unable to realize the importance of recreation
for all the people. But, on the whole, the trend
is good and in the right direction. Within the
past few years, an ever-increasing number of
cities, towns and villages have not only been
awakening to the recreation needs of their peo-
ple, but have been taking concrete steps to im-

prove the leisure-time opportunities for their
young and old, rich and poor.

Recent

Developments
in Several

Countries

GERMANY The recreation program in Germany
since the war has been exceedingly limited and,
owing to economic conditions, a large portion of
the population cannot enjoy opportunities for
attractive forms of recreation. Provision for

public recreation in the way of playgrounds, com-'

munity centers, sports areas and parks is re—.
stricted to a few large cities. Available sports
areas and gymnasiums are controlled primarily
by private sports clubs in which political influence
and commercialism play a large part.

The Office of the U. S. High Commissioner for
Germany has taken the lead in helping to develop
recreation opportunities on a democratic basis;
and athletic and sports programs for both sexes
are expanding. To meet the crucial need for
democratically-trained leaders, a college for train-
ing sports leaders was established; training con-
ferences for youth committees have been held;
and leadership training schools and camp demon-
stration programs have been carried on. German
leaders have been sent to the United States for
training and observation of methods and programs
provided by public and private recreation agencies.

Membership in organized youth groups, en-
couraged through the formation of community
councils and youth committees, has increased
rapidly. In April 1949, 10,690 youth groups with
a total of 1,378,800 members were reported in
We American zone. In addition, 933 youth
cw “I rs and 107 youth hostels were reported, and
r'  ' "u- ' .uth agencies conducted one or more

GREAT BRI'I UN Non-governmental agencies

continue to play an important part in the promo-
tion and provision of recreation in Great Britain.
One of these, The National Playing Fields
Association, since its foundation in 1925, has
spent approximately 500,000 pounds raised by
public subscription in grants which have helped
secure 1,200 football pitches, 650 cricket pitches,
900 tennis courts, 190 bowling greens, 263 rec—
reation centers and 760 children’s playgrounds,
among others.* The association strives to ensure
the acquisition, layout and construction of ade-
quate playing fields and the provision of chil-
dren’s playgrounds; protects existing fields from
appropriation for other purposes; publicizes and
helps make effective the government grants sys—
tem; and gives expert advice on layout, main—
tenance and legal problems.

The Central Council of Physical Recreation—on
which are represented 190 national associations,
including the governing bodies of sport and volun—
tary youth organizations —-— is another agency
which promotes physical recreation. It serves as
a central source of information, issues publica—
tions, conducts training centers for leaders and
coaches, offers advisory services to its member
organizations, and initiates experiments’ designed
to encourage more people to take part. The list
of member organizations indicates the wide
variety of auSpices under which various forms of
recreation, particularly Sports, are carried on in
Great Britain.

The National Council of Social Service, repre—
senting a different type of recreation interest, has
promoted community centers and associations
through its publications and services. The Na-
tional Federation of Community Associations re-
ported a total of 350 centers in 1949, in spite of
the difliculty in providing premises in which to
house the activities. Some school buildings are in
use as centers, but “the federation remains con-
vinced that a separate building is the ideal,”
preferably with two halls, a common room, kitch—
en, general meeting rooms and special facilities,
such as a gymnasium, workshop, music room or
billiard room.

INDIA An India Recreation Association has
been formed since the end of the Second World
War and patterned, in part, after the National
Recreation Association. It receives some govern-
ment subsidy, but is largely supported by contri-
butions from several trust funds. A number of
Indian cities have established recreation depart-
ments, and in several others recreation is con-

Special attention is given to the most underprivi-

The educational program launched by the
Indian Government proposes a national youth
movement to provide recreative and social activi-
ties, a library for every village, Scout organiza-
tions in all schools, the fostering of artistic and
cultural activities, and a central training college
of physical education for play and recreation
leaders. Interest is growing in the wider use of
the school plant for community recreation. All-
India and provincial physical education con-
ferences have considered problems related to rec-
reation facilities and programs, especially sports.
The Madras Government has appointed and
trained more than fifty leaders to organize rec-
reation programs in the rural areas.

JAPAN Since the revival of the Japan Recrea~
tion Association following the war, the recreation
movement has been making steady progress in
this country. By January 1950, sixteen units had
been organized in different prefectures, and no
less than 100 groups in cities with branches of the
association. The Third National Recreation Con—
gress, to be held in July of this year, will be
devoted to group and sectional conferences, lec—
tures, study reports, demonstrations, exhibits,
educational trips and recreation activities.
Special activities conducted by the Tokyo Rec-
reation Association in 1949 were a kite flying
contest attended by 1,000 children; a battledore
and shuttlecock contest for elementary school
girls; a girls’ celebration, with decorated dolls,
storytelling, singing games and dramatic play; a
boys’ celebration, attended by more than 4,000
children, with police band, group singing, story-
telling, games, drawing, picture and puppet show;
a Christmas program, with children singing
Christmas songs, Storytelling and motion pictures.
Summer playground activities included apparatus
instruction, games, nature study, singing games,
day camp, music, storytelling and sandcraft.

AUSTRALIA Playground associations and other
private agencies in a few cities have attempted for
years to develop public interest in community rec—
reation. Playground programs for children have
been conducted during the summer months and
parks and other recreation areas have been pro-
vided in a number of cities, but relatively little
has been done by municipal authorities to provide
recreation for all the people. Federal and state
funds are made available for playground leader-
ship, training courses for recreation leaders,

' school camping and youth services. The Com-

monwealth Council for National Fitness, which
administers the Commonwealth funds, is the cen-
tral agency for the promotion of physical rec-
reation and coordinates state and local recreation
efforts. State and local fitness councils have been
established throughout the Commonwealth. Their
first responsibility in the field of playground de-
velopment is “to bring before local government
authorities and voluntary groups the strong need
which exists in the community for fully staffed
and adequately equipped playgrounds.” Marked
progress has been made since the war in the de-

Report on Graduate Study

112 REPORT of the National Conference on
TGraduate Study in Health Education, Physi—
cal Education and Recreation—Which recently“
convened at the Pere Marquette State Park in
Illinois—is now available. Priced at one dollar a
copy, it may be secured from the Athletic Insti-
tute, 209 South State Street, Chicago 4‘, Illinois.

Thirty-six official delegates, eight consultants
and two Canadian observers attended almost two
weeks of meetings to consider pressing problems
relating to graduate study. Similar to the under—
graduate conference held at Jackson’s Mill, West
Virginia, in 1948, the graduate conference brought
together leaders from the college training curricu-
lums and from the park and recreation fields.
Among the fifteen national sponsoring organiza-
tions were the American Recreation Society, the
National Institute of Park Executives and the
National Recreation Association.

The two reports—one from the 1950 national
conference on graduate study, and the other from
the 1948 conference on undergraduate training—-
provide a helpful basis from which to work in
improving the recreation training conducted by
colleges and universities.

These institutions of learning will find the re—-
ports helpful in evaluating their recreation train-
ing curriculums. Recreation departments and
agencies employing personnel will do well to re-
cruit from those schools which are applying these
suggested principles and standards. Colleges
should also make it possible for their recreation
instructors-t0 keep close to the field by attending
and participating in the National Recreation Con—
gresses and in other important training and rec—
reation conferences.

Japan
Recreation Congress

The next National Recreation Congress of
Japan is to be held in Sapporo, Hokkaido, in the
northern part of that country, from July 20 to 24,
1950. The Honorable Hiroshi Takada, member
of the House of Councillors,* who is now in this
country, brings an urgent message from the Japan
Recreation Association stating that it is its sin-
cere hope that our own National Recreation
Association can be represented at that meeting.

Soichi Saito, president of the Japan association
writes: “\V e owe a debt of gratitude to your com—
mittee for giving us constant encouragement and
assistance . . . would deem it a great honor if you
could send delegates to this congress during the
summer.”

Therefore, the NRA seriously desires to hear of
(my recreation friends who may be planning to
visit Japan during this time. Please notify Tom
Rivers as quickly as possible.

lnternatienal Later llrganinatien Meets in Geneva

0 THE FIRST MEETING of experts of the Correspondence Committee on Recreation*
of the International Labor Organization was held in Geneva from October 3'Ist
to November 3rd, 1949. Sixteen experts and advisors' attended from _the follow1ng
twelve countries: Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Greece, Ind1a, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The
United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza—
tion and the World Health Organization were also represented at the meeting.

The International Labor thce had submitted two reports to serve as a basis
for the committee’s discussion. The first reviewed the activities of the I.L.O. in the
field of workers’ recreation; the second dealt with facilities for young workers’
leisure time and holidays.

In opening the meeting, Jef Rens, Assistant Director-General of the 
emphasized the growing interest all over the world in the organization of faC111t1es
for recreation. Dr. Harold D. Meyer, Professor of Sociology at the University of
North Carolina, who was elected chairman, pointed out that recreation and facilities
for leisure-time activities could make a genuine contribution to the development of

satisfactory international relations and lasting peace. He characterized recreation
as “a lively springboard to international goodwill.”

in

General Discussion—Several committee mem-
bers described the position of their respective
countries with regard to important problems con—
cerning workers’ recreation. It was emphasized
that all organization activities in the field of rec—
reation should respect the complete freedom of
the individual. “The role of the state consisted
of coordinating, stimulating and supporting the
organization of recreation facilities while main-
taining control of any financial support it may
have given.”

In its resolution, the committee considered that
recreation is a basic universal desire and a neces-
sity of human life, and that the organization of
recreational activities should be closely coordi-
nated in programs of hea_lth,'education and wel-
fare of the workers. It should further be directed
toward the development of family life.

Special interest was attached to the question of
popular travel, and support was given the idea of
creating, under the auspices of the I.L.O., an in-
formation center on recreation and leisure-time
activities. The committee asked the I.L.O. to
study the following questions with a view to their
inclusion in the agenda of future meetings: rec-
reation for rural and industrial workers; the edu-
cation of workers with regard to their cultural
and vocational training; training of organizers
and recreation leaders; popular travel, especially
on an international basis; organization of national
and international festivals of the arts; promotion
(1' games and sports on a national and inter-
n' .1 nal basis; promotion of recreation facilities
and activities which may aid in the prevention of
illness especially industrial diseases.

'Howard -Lraccher. president of the NRA, was serving as a mem-
ber of this comm-nee at the time of his death in 1949.

Recreation for Young Workers—-—During the
meeting, a special working group considered the
report concerning facilities for the leisure-time
activities of young persons, including holiday
camps for young workers. The committee, in a
resolution, emphasized that beneficial utilization
of leisure time of youth depends upon favorable
conditions of work and life, liberty of the individ-
ual, and adequate leadership by qualified persons.

It further declared that public authorities should
provide adequate accommodations and facilities,
particularly when cities or towns are being
planned or reconstructed, and encourage organiza-
tions providing for leisure—time activities of young
persons; that maximum advantage should be
taken of the exchange of information between
countries; that attention should be given to the
needs of special groups of young persons, such
as the unemployed, rural workers, domestic
workers; and that young workers should take
part in programs designed for all young persons.

It was proposed that leisure programs for
youth might include hobbies, handcrafts, reading
and use of libraries, indoor and outdoor group
games, folk and social dancing, gymnastics and
sports, music, group singing, dramatics, painting,
modeling, gardening, care of pets, hiking, camp—
ing, study circles, conferences, discussions, guided
tours, excursions, the cinema, radio, recorded
music and the press, holiday camps, youth hostels,
rest homes, and community projects designed to

enable young persons to contribute to community
welfare.

RECREA TION FILM

RELEA SED

Tnose WHO HAVE been asking about General

Electric's new film—“A Chance to Play”—
which has been produced by the March of Time
with the technical direction of the National Rec—
reation Association, will be delighted to know
that it is now available. This new addition to GE’s
More Power to America sound motion picture
series is designed to assist civic leaders in demon-
strating to their communities the urgent need to
provide proper recreation facilities. It effectively
dramatizes the fact that recreation is everybody’s
business.

The twenty-minute black and white docu-
mentary film is one of jive components of the
General Electric’s Outdoor Recreation MPA pro-
gram kit.* This also contains literature to assist
in planning for community and industrial recrea—
tion programs. A thirty-six—page manual, “Rec—
reation Is Everybody’s Business,” was prepared
with the assistance of the National Recreation
Association and is addressed to civic leaders. It
covers such topics as: how toiorganize for com-
munity recreation, how to defend the recreation
budget, how to put the recreation plan into action,
and how connnunities have conducted successful
recreation campaigns. Included also is a biblio-

graphy of helpful literature and tips on conducting
successful meetings.

Another manual, “Industrial Recreation Is
(inn «1 Business," a twelve—page booklet addressed
to industrial leaders, also was prepared with the
r beration of the National Industrial Recreation
.L“' .iatir 1.1. This booklet points out the many

advantages of recreation in modern industry and
covers such topics as: why industrial recreation
pays off, how to get a recreation program started,
what such a program should include, and the im-
portance of Hoodlighting in industrial recreation.
Also included in the MPA kit is a “Manual of
Floodlighting Plans,” covering techniques of
illuminating a wide range of outdoor sports areas
and bringing home to the individual citizen the
need for better recreation. Audience handouts are
furnished for use with the motion pictures.
\ ,“A Chance to Play” documents the benefits of
more play time and better recreation facilities,
pointing out that in the majority of communities
throughout the United States today recreation
facilities are woefully lacking, and thousands of
youngsters are forced to seek amusement in the
streets. As a result, in a single year, more than
50,000 children have been injured in street acci-
dents, 800 of which proved to be fatalities.
Documentary facts in the manuals point out that
in a Minnesota community the safety committee
of the Chamber of Commerce marked the location
of each street accident by a dot on a map. The
committee was struck by the appearance of a
number of practically spotless areas. An investi-
gation revealed that the center of each accident-
free area was usually the location of a playground.
In New York City, 12,271 children were killed
or injured by street accidents in 1933. By 1935.
after the playground system had been doubled,
street accidents dropped thirty-one per cent --— to
less than 8,500. New York City continued to
expand its playgrounds and, by 1939, street acci—

dents involving children had dropped another ten
per cent.

RECREATION

Scene locations for “A Chance to Play” ex-
tended from New England to California.
Throughout the country, producers of the film
found progressive municipalities accepting the
fact that recreation is an essential part of com—
munity life, ranking in importance with public
health and education. Civic leaders and officials
of cities and towns of every size were reappraising
the outdoor recreation needs of their communi-
ties. However, the film states that of the more
than 16,000 United States municipalities, only
2,500 support organized recreation services and
only one-eighth of the nation's recreation workers
are employed full-time the year round.

The film illustrates the fact that the unsuper-
vised teen-ager today quickly acquires the free-
and-easy habits which often lead to delinquency.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that
over a ten-year period arrests have increased near-
ly fifty per cent, and that the majority of the
crimes were committed by those twenty-one years
of age and younger.

The fact that recreation counteracts delinquency
and crime is shown in the manual “Recreation Is
Everybody's Business,” and interesting statistics
are quoted. These have been secured through the
National Recreation Association.

Though recreation alone will not prevent de-
linquency, the kit material emphasizes that it
assists and maintains the moral and physical
health of the community. For example, during
World \Var II, some three and a half million
young men, who might have been healthier and
stronger—had they been provided with adequate
recreation areas in their childhood———were rejected
as unfit for service in the armed forces.

However, the MPA Outdoor Recreation Pro-
gram is not directed to the teen-age recreation
problem alone. It brings out the fact that better

than eleven per cent of the United States’ popu-
lation is over sixty years of age. Thus, pro—
gressive community planners are becoming in-
creasingly aware of the special recreation needs
of the aging. But critical as is the recreation prob-
lem for all other segments of the population in
this country, it is even more serious for the na-
tion’s fifty-eight million working men and women
who cannot take advantage of the facilities which
most recreation centers offer only during day-
light hours. The film, in a dramatic documentary
fashion, explains to the audience that after night-
fall the community recreation problem becomes
more acute owing to the fact that most courts
and playing fields are closed as night approaches.
Thus, recognizing the urgent need for adequate
day and night recreation facilities, civic leaders
are shown in the film working toward a solution
to their community problem.

The viewpoint of large industrial companies re-
garding the American worker in respect to rec-
reation is also shown in many outdoor night
scenes. The Voice of Time explains that pro-
gressive companies today not only encourage their
employees to participate'in recreation activities,
but often cooperate in providing and maintaining
lighted playing fields. No matter what his job,
the employee who has a chance to play in his
off-hours will invariably do a better job if given
the opportunity to build team spirit and a better
company spirit during these recreation periods.
' The final scenes of “A Chance to Play” sum-
marize that it is up to the American civic leaders
to take the action necessary for sweeping im-
provement on the recreation front, but that the
problem of recreation in America must be solved,
not by a single group alone, but through the ac-
tive participation of every citizen in the land—for
recreation is everybody's business.

 

Displaced Persons in Your Community

HE DISPL.\CED PERSONS ACT of 1948 author-

ized the admission of some 205,000 displaced
persons into the United States as immigrants for
permanent residence. They are expected to arrive
in this country by the fall of 1950, when the act
expires, and are being settled in rural and urban
communities throughout the country.

Since their satisfactory adjustment and Ameri-
canization is a matter of concern to everyone, the
Displaced Persons Commission is making a spe-
cific inquiry about those immigrants under eight-

IUNE 1950

een years of age. It is being directed primarin
to public and parochial schools, social and wel-
fare agencies and recreation departments and
agencies in cities, communities and rural areas
which have been most active in requesting these
displaced persons. The survey will attempt to find
out just how well the foreign youngsters are be-
ing accepted by the community. whether they are
being included in the local recreation programs.
in which activities they are participating. and the
answers to other such questions.

A received of the death of james B. \Villiams
on May 1.‘ in ('learwater, Florida. Mr. Williams
was a staff member of the National Recreation
Association for many years, faithfully serving rec-
reation interests in the held until his retirement
on October I, 1948. In the capacity of staff mem-
her. he was one of those who worked closely with

the Federal Government on behalf of the associa-.

tion. (If this service he said in retrospect: “I
shall always have vividly in mind my almost eight
years of continuous service with the National
Park Service of the United States Department of
Interior, ‘on loan’ from the association. 'There
was a growing conviction, on the' part of the asso—
ciation, of the important share that the Federal
Government should have in the public recreation
movement. Here is another example of how the
association was willing to adapt its program to
help interpret the demonstrated principles of the
- recreation program.”

' F I'Ol’l} the very beginning, his work had been
of a pioneering nature. As a young man, firmly
convinced that public responsibility in the social
work field was becoming more important, he ac—
cepted the position of director of the Public VVel-
fare Department of Los Angeles. Soon, thereafter,
World War I started and with it came an invi-
tation from the National Recreation Association
to join the stan of its \Var Camp Community
Service. Later, Mr. \\-'i11iams was loaned to the

these two responsibilities presented  first op-
portunities to work officially in the recreatiori
lield on both a private and public basis. After the“
war, he became district representative of the Na-

' tional Recreation Association in the southeast.

On the eve of his retirement, he wrote:

,“. . . From time to time, opportunities have
come to me to re-enter the public welfare field,
and attractive offers, at larger salaries, have been
presented in the Community Chest movement.
For a period of eight months, when I was on
leave of absence from the association, I did act as
organizer and executive of the Community Chest
of Jacksonville, Florida, and was asked to remain
permanently. However, my experience on the
staff of the association had developed within me
a very strong attachment to its work and a reali-
zation of its significance, and I therefore declined
all such offers.”

young people in attractive language, discusses
how to organize leisure time to get the most out
of it; how to plan recreation to meet individual
needs; and how to start a hobby. It discusses
also the value of hobbies as a source of emotional
security. This is an effective booklet for youth
leaders as well as for youth. An Instructor’s

THIS IS THE dramatic story of how a city
tackled the problem of youth gangs — of the
Los Angeles Youth Project created following the
“zoot-suit” riots in 1943. The objectives of this
unique experiment included the provision of youth
services in neglected areas to both teen—age boys
and girls, with emphasis on intercultural activi-
ties. The project was based on cooperative plan-
ning and action by youth-serving agencies, rather
than on ‘mere expansion of each agency’s own
program and personnel, and was distinctive be-
cause of this cooperativeness. The board of edu—
cation and the recreation and park departments
participated.

This objective report includes some specific
examples of typical services developed, although
Its emphasis is on the administrative aspects of
the project. rather than on recording case histories

of youth groups, illustrating closely knit neigh-
borhood planning.
