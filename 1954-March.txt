132 RECREATII

Emma 1954

Dorothea Lensch

WORDS, BAFFLING WORDS to express recreation; how

does one describe a way of living, a sensation of well
being, that alive quality that brings deep satisfaction to the
individual and to all with whom he associates? Recreation
is always a personal thing, dependent upon sensitivity,
sentiment, and sincerity.

It is this quality of sensitivity that allows for varia~
tion, flexibility, and color or “glamour.” It gives a creative
approach to all orthodox methods and the tools of recrea~
tion such as drama, music, arts, and crafts. Likewise, it
allows for the inter-play between the sports and the so-called expressive arts.

 

Without sentiment, which in ordinary words is the ability to love and to express this
feeling, there can be no true satisfaction. It is the dedication of the individual participat-

ing, which assures him of personal growth. This self-expression cannot be satisfied Until he
in turn shares this with others.

Society may hold as taboo the verbal expression of our relationships with others, but
certainly society cannot withhold from the individual, thr( " the use of his hands, body,
or mind, the tangible expression of sentiment. '

Coupled with sensitivity and sentiment must be sincerity. Without this quality there is
an awareness of superficiality. Recreation is a social art and not a pure art. It depends upon
the needs of the people to determine its form. Within the various types or forms that are

required to give satisfaction to the individual needs of the people, there is opportunity for
specialization.

Specialization is the pattern of modern time, forced by the scientific age. The impact
of specialization can cause disintegration through giving a hodge-podge program rather
than an integrated one. It is this struggle to preserve an integration or a balance within
the recreation offerings of a community that makes it play such an important role in the
livcs of the people. The balance of programming depends upon leaders who are thoughtful
social planners, aware of opposing forces both constructive and destructive.

It is the individual, and not the masses, who is the barometer of the community’s re-
sponse to the ever-changing form of recreation. With an atmosphere of individual choice
and self-expression, harmonious leaders blend the communitv and the program. Each com-
munity is a creative unit in itself.

The joy of living, the anticipation of each day is the vibrant essence of recreation. It
is this that brings participation in the social art, recreation.

MISS LENSCII, director of recreation in Portland, Oregon, is
a member of the National Advisory Committee on Recruit-
ment, Training and Placement of Recreation Personnel.

A Challenge to Recreation

Sirs:

The growth of recreation in the first
half of the twentieth century has been a
story of somewhat astounding expan-
sion. This development, however, has
been a grass roots growth fostered by
local needs recognized on the local level.
Recreation is in dire need of inspiring
leadership on the top level.

Our leaders have been studious, in-
telligent, far sighted, idealistic, and con-
scientious in their devoted work in the
recreational field. At the same time they
have been naive and overly cautious in
their efforts to sell recreation to the
American public. They have pursued a
staid, safe pace in their salesmanship at
a time when the high presssure ap-
proach is making all the sales.

Let us briefly consider, one by one,
the areas in which we have failed and
in which we are continuing to fail.

In our colleges alone we are failing
in several areas. We are missing the
boat in departments training recreation
workers. Despite the fact that physical
education is only a part of recreation.
we find the positions reversed and our
recreation students assuming a second-
ary and sometimes a tertiary position
behind health education students in col-
lege departments of physical education.

Another good example of missing the
boat is in the matter of school camping.
Although we are credited with having
the know-how and the training, it is the
classroom teacher who is handling the
school camping program.

Recreation programs for college stu-
dents are usually poor and the average
college athletic departments make a
mockery of the very basic principles of
recreation. Dr. Robert M. Hutchins in
the Saturday Review of Literature well
illustrated this when he pointed out that
New York University explained that it
was drOpping intercollegiate football
because of its financial unsoundness
rather than because collegiate football
is a hypocritical mess that abnegates
the very essence of fair play, sportsman-
ship, and amateur athletic competition.

Returning to our schools that are
training recreation people we find a
wide variance in curriculum and a gen-
eral lack of. agreement. Our courses
cater to skills rather than to leadership.

134

attend:

 

At the same time we decry inroads
made into recreational placements by
group workers who have gone to the
other extreme and learn leadership
without skills. One is as ineffectual as
the other.

We, along with education, are doing
a poor job of recruiting students. The
recent tests given by the government to
determine educational draft deferments
showed conclusively that the very low-
est scholastic rung of the collegiate lad-
der is occupied by physical education,
among which are included our recrea-
tional trainees.

Consider industrial recreation. Man-
agement uses recreation as a paternalis-
tic device, a personnel gimmick, and a
gadget to expedite production and pre-
vent excessive employee turnover. In-
dustrial recreation workers come from
the plants themselves or are hired from
names on the headlines of the sports
pages. Organized recreation has been
unable to get even a toenail inside the
door of this tremendous potential.

I mentioned the sports page head-
lines. Our sports writers support the
over-emphasis of athletics that has
caused the mess on the collegiate and
even the scholastic level. It has been
through the sports pages that move-
ments like Little League and similar ele-
mentary school age activities have been
overly stressed, and competitive ath-
letics have so meteorically streaked
across the land.

What about the remainder of the
paper? Have we sold editors on recre-
ation so that they in turn might sell the
public on recreation? We have not.

A fine example is the scant coverage
given the National Recreation Congress
by the Philadelphia papers while 1,700
delegates were meeting in the City of
Brotherly Love. To make matters even
worse, one paper in Philadelphia print-
ed during the week an editorial plead-
ing for support of PAL and did not even

mention recreation in a single line.

Each year the New York Herald Tri-

bune holds a forum of national interest.
This year several sessions were devoted
to leisure time. Did anyone from the

recreation movement express our,

ideas? Speakers included a professor of
history, an industrial designer, and a
national pollster.

I

Now, how about our national govern
ment? At the present moment a con
gressional investigating committee i:
studying juvenile delinquency. It wil
be interesting to see the extent to whicl

our top level recreation pe0ple are con
sulted.

Furthermore, although the practici
may be a pernicious one, every majo
phase of American life is represente:
among Washington lobbies and pres
sure groups. If recreation can be in
cluded in such a listing, it is not to m;
knowledge. I believe it is vital that on
know the art of self defense if bullie
are to be kept from taking an unfai
advantage.

What then is wrong with our leadel
ship?

Consider the American Recreatio
Society. It has been only in the last thre
years that a long-standing disagreemer

with the NRA was settled and th

hatchet buried. At the National Cor

gress this year the rank and file e)
pressed a strong feeling that the AR
is clique ridden.

The ARS does not have a monopoly 0
this type of reaction. This year one (
the oldest state recreation societie
found their nominating committee non
inating themselves and then proceedin
to railroad through the election.

Probably the easiest way to lucid]
demonstrate the lack of public regar
for recreation in general and our lac
of leadership in particular is to poi]
out a few items from our recent n:
tional meeting in Philadelphia.

First, the hotel. Our meeting room
were scattered about the building an
in general we were jammed into in
adequate areas. Crowded exhibitOJ
showed a lack of enthusiasm and inte
est.

As I mentioned earlier, the loc-
papers ignored us. If five hundre
Philadelphians outside the hotel kne
that a recreation convention was beir
held in the city, it would be astoundin

Our main speakers included tl
mayor, the governor, and a secretal
from the federal cabinet. The speech:
were political in nature, soothing ar
non-commital to recreation and the a
tendance went from full-house to ha]
a-house to an embarrassingly scattert
few.

At the regular meetings, discussit
seemed to center on local problems th
could have and should have been SE
tled in area meetings, through distri
representatives, or through some pe
sonal research. We relied on our on
people too much for a source of spea

RECREATIG

E'I'S and almost completely ignored al-
'ied fields as well as those in direct op-
aosition to our philosOphies and en-
ieavors.

Most important, however, is that we
name out of the congress with nothing
mncrete. We learned of no national
rends, resolved no policies, took no
tands and deve10ped no stature.

Here, then, lies our failure. We are
'hameleons pacing on tartan plaids. Dr.
hlnes Conant once stated that a turtle

akes progress only when his neck is

it. Recreation must take stands. Rec-

tion must fight issues. The national
ire services should have been full of
cws from Philadelphia rather than a

w pictures to the home town news-

pers. Recreation must go out on an

‘casional limb. We cannot be all
rings to all men.

We must throw conservatism out the
lindow; and yet maintain our integrity
nd our purposes. We must invade the

wspaper and magazine worlds, for

ese are the most read mediums in our
Ind. We must hammer the public with
ess agentry. Our product is vital
tough to sell itself but the first rule of
e foodmarket is that stock cannot be

oved until it can be placed where it
till be seen and noticed.

Space limits prevent more than a cur-
ory scraping of the t0pie. Perhaps I
he been iconoclastic and I have obvi-
hlsly eliminated all mention of many

e phases in our develOpment. How-
For, we cannot rest on our minor gains,
pd we must abandon our policy of self
lilogization and meet our challenges if
e ever hope to achieve our potential.

Answers to Mr. Morris

“‘5:

' l have read with interest the preced-
Ig letter from Mortimer H. Morris;
nd as president of the National Indus-
Iial Recreation Association, I would
ke to comment on several of his state-

Eaten 1954-

ments about industrial (employee) rec-
reation.

He writes, “Our courses cater to
skills rather than to leadership.” To
this the National Industrial Recreation
Association says “Amen!” We have
tried in the past to point this out to the
institutions of higher learning, but with
little success. This year, our organiza-
tion is planning to take the initiative
and do something concrete about it.

Quoting again from Mr. Morris’ let-
ter, “Management uses recreation as a
paternalistic device, a personnel gim-
mick, and a gadget to expedite produc-
tion and prevent excessive employee
turnover.” To anyone at all familiar
with the industrial recreation move-
ment, such a statement clearly indicates
a complete lack of understanding of
what is going on, and he just doesn’t
know what he is talking about. Recrea-
tion programs would “die” in no time
at all if they were hased on such a phi-
losophy. A soundly-organized recrea-

tion program in industry is here to stay a

and it is fast becoming recognized as an
excellent human relations tool if pro-
perly used. There are literally thous-
ands of successful recreation programs
in business and industry today, indicat-
ing that industry has recognized the
value and importance of providing op-
portunities for the wholesome use of
leisure time to employees.

Sirs:

The letter by Mortimer H. Morris is
certainly “A Challenge to Recreation.”
It is commendable if for no other rea-
son than that it is different. Criticism,
though not always to our liking, fre-
quently stimulates introspection, which
in turn is good for any group or any
movement.

Although I do not propose to com-
ment on the entire article, I am
prompted to add agreement to one
phase of it—that which comes under the
general heading of puhlicity.

Publicity is involved in Mr. Morris’
letter in a number of ways—the insuf-
ficiency of it and its poor quality at the
recreation congress; its absence from
editorial columns; its disproportionate
share to “overly-stressed” competitive
athletics; its absence from national pro-
grams where it should be included.

The remedy for the deficiencies men:
tioned in the article—not only those
which come specifically under the head-
ing of publicity, as we are accustomed
to regard it, but other shortcomings in
our field of interest—is a united and

more intensive effort to get our profes-
sion and its value into such a position
that it will command the attention of
editors, administrators and legislators
at every level, leaders in community life
and the public in general.

As the article states, recreation has
had an “astounding expansion.” It also
has had some valuable accomplishments-
and many effective contributions and
studies and develOpments to its credit.
These accomplishments have not yet
been sufficiently sold to the nation.
Other groups such as industry, labor,
the sciences and, in an allied field, edu-
cation, are in the position where recog-
nition is practically mandatory. An
outstanding illustration is the unified
nationwide agitation for better schools,
better standards and hetter pay for
teachers.

Every element in the recreation com-
position—workers, executives, profes-
sional organizations, professional pub-
lications, recreational educators——
should, at their respective levels, unite
in the effort to push the recreation
course heyond its own strictures. We
will not be called in by those who can
publicize us. The pressure must come
from us, and it must come with such
uniformity and such force that it cannot
be resisted.

Let us not be content to make studies
and publish the results for the recrea-
tion profession alone. Let us not mere-
ly debate the “pros” and “cons” of some
movement which arises to affect our
field of activity. Let us take our beliefs
to the bar of public opinions. A nation-
ally spread headline, even if provoca-
tive, will pay dividends in its reactions.
Once the p0pulace knows we are a
force, we Will command respect and our
Opinions will be sought. Then, when we
speak our voices will reach beyond our
own hearing.

STEPHEN H. MAIIONEY, Superin-
tendent of Recreation, Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

It It It It

Sirs:

Taken as a whole the letter from
Morty Morris is indeed “challenging”
and stimulating. His citation of the
“areas—in which we are continuing to
fail” is at least sufficiently valid to
shock us and cause us to squirm a bit.

Perhaps the most effective way to
start a,action in response to this chal-
lenge would be to answer two ques-
tions: (1) Does the record show fiat fail-
ure or a tremendously effective continu-
ing sales campaign that has pushed com-
munity recreation from nothing to a
nation-wide acceptance in less than fifty
years? (2) What does recreation now

135

need most to help the next big forward
push?

An intelligent understanding of the
past record will certainly serve as the
best springboard for the next big ad-

vance.

Anybody who was close to Howard
Braucher and Joseph Lee, and the Na-
tional Recreation Association in the
years following 1909 would certainly
laugh at the statement that recreation
was a “grass roots growth . . . fostered
. . . on the local leve .”

Somebody got President Theodore
Roosevelt to call a White House Confer-
ence on Recreation. Somebody stirred
Governor Hiram Johnson to back a rec-
reation survey in California. Other na-
tionally known leaders who were
brought into real action (not just names
on a letterhead) included John Finley,
Myron T. Herrick, Newton D. Baker,

Robert Garrett, William Mather, John
Winant and Harry Overstreet.

In the first six years of the campaign,
the promotional budget moved from

$25,000 to $90,000, (and now has
reached about $1,000,000). In both
world wars, recreation played an ef-
fective part and received great impetus
for peace-time expansion. Capitalizing
on the army draft statistics, recreation
led the universal physical education
campaign which spread laws requiring
instruction in sports and games through-
out the public schools. In both booms
and depressions following the world
wars recreation has been able to move
into important positions of specialized
servwe.

The recreation congresses have spot-
lighted and given annual impetus to rec-
reation. Joe Prendergast in the very
recent years has demonstrated the new
power and skill in leadership which he
will increasingly contribute. New na-
tional committees with very strong lead-
ership have been created. Important
new relations have been established
with powerful allies, within as well as
outside the government. International
relationships have been strengthened.

Well what is holding us back? Indef-
initeness is holding us back. We talk
glibly about recreation and the “recrea-
tion movement.” When asked what we
mean we talk a half-hour. It is such a
big subject and we are so full of it!
We have been afraid of regimentation
and scared to death of uniformity? We
have said, “It doesn’t make any differ-
ence what a person does for recreation.”
“It doesn’t make any difference how a
community organizes its recreational
services.” Social workers have said that
recreation is group work, a phase of

136

social work by means of which twisted
minds are straightened out so that in-
dividuals may live in harmony with
their environment. Educators have said
that recreation is a tool of education by
means of which the individlial is trained
to bring his latent powers into full frui-
tion. Park department executives have
said that they need a recreation director
to manage the use of the activity areas
in the parks. Medical doctors and men-
tal hygienists have drafted recreation as
a potent therapeutic aid—and so on—
and so on! 1!

When are we going to stand up and
say that all people have a right to rec-
reation, whether it does them any good
or not?

Every community needs a public de-
partment of recreation with the respon-
sibility of seeing to it that adequate rec-
reational Opportunities are afforded to
all residents.

Every community recreation depart-
ment should plan, provide and admin-

' ister the community-owned recreation

facilities. Every community recreation
department should lead in stimulating,
aiding and correlating the recreation
programs offered by the various public
and voluntary agencies.

Every community recreation depart-
ment should be staffed by well-educated
personnel competent not only to admin-
ister recreation facilities and programs
but also to cooperate with other public
and private agencies needing to use rec-
reation as a therapeutic aid.

We now have a new national commit-
tee on research. May we hope that it
will find out how a number of different
forms of community recreation organi-
zations are working out? Perhaps some
forms have proved ineffective and
wasteful. If so, let’s concentrate on sell-
ing the forms that have worked best.

Hospital Recreation

Sirs:

In the article “Is Hospital Recreation
on the Move,” in the February 1954
issue of RECREATION, Mr. Dimock has
made a sound contribution to the litera-
ture relating to recreation in hospitals.

First, his re-emphasis of the approach
through people rather than through ac-
tivities is stated very well. None of us
can be reminded too often that our
paramount concern should be the needs
of the individual patient.

Second, he skillfully leads up to the
important value of making all services

in the hospital positive in nature—pos-i
tive for the patient in terms of hi
eventual return to a normal living situ
anon.

Lastly, Mr. Dimock alerts us to th
fact that hospital recreation is expand
ing rapidly. Further, he warns of th
lack of understanding that exists amon;
the various groups that work in hospi
tals and makes a plea for better undei
standing and cooperation.

This article does not in every respec
represent the views of all who work i:
hospital recreation. However, this doc
not imply that the author has a narrou
viewpoint, rather it indicates that i
such a rapidly expanding field there ar
many viewpoints—this perhaps is
healthy sign.

DR. JOHN L. HUTCHINSON, Associat
Professor of Education, Teacher
College, Columbia University.

I- * * *

Sirs:

I have read Mr. Hedley Dimock’s a1
ticle with great care. I find myself be
coming increasingly concerned by th
article as I study it more deeply.

From my point of view three majo
fallacies are stated:

1. That the three levels of recreation a
outlined in the article can be separated

2. That there can be professional lead
ership if leadership comes from variou
disciplines.

3. That recreation is part of nursini
service.

My reasons for considering these fal
lacies are as follows:

1. The three levels of recreation as oul
lined are separate and distinct. In work
ing with people, a recognized principl+
is that you meet people where they ar:
and attempt to help them to achiev:
greater use of and satisfactions in thei
own capacities and talents. People
when they are hospitalized, are no dif
ferent from any cross section of peopl:
in a community. Some are recreatio:
illiterates, some have skills and capaci
ties for which they need outlets ant
others have leadership abilities whicl
can be used for the satisfaction of indi
vidual needs and for the benefit of th:
group. The objectives of recreation an
the same, the methods of reaching ob
jectives simply must be changed to mee
the situation in which the individua
finds himself. If an objective of recre
ation is to give every individual an op
portunity to live creatively in his leisurt
time, this objective remains the semi
whether the individual is functioning
on his own in his home, in a community
center or in a hospital. In each case
there is the basic assumption that he has

RECREATION

eisure time and he wishes to use it cre-
Itively. This indicates another impor-
ant basic tenet of recreation, namely
hat the choice of re-creative experience
s dependent upon the wishes or desires
)f the individual participant.

To me the three levels of recreation
11 hospitals, as stated, are dogmatic clas-
:ilications having no validity. Recrea-
ion to be effective analyses the recrea-
ion needs and desires of people and
)lllIdS programs to'meet these needs
1an desires.

2. That thcre can be professional lead-
:rship with that leadership gathered
'rom any number of different disci-
)lines.

The mark of a profession is that it is
Jased on a highly specialized intellec-
ual technique and that the profes-
:ional technique is capable of communi-
zating thoroughly a highly specialized
sducational discipline. Recreation to-
iay is usually considered to have made
:orne real strides towards achieving this
'evel. However, if any discipline can be
:onsidered adequate preparation for
recreation leadership, then professional
status can never be achieved because no
specialized technique will ever be fully
developed.

3. That recreation is part of nursing
service.

The whole person enters the hospital
and in every facet of service to him, it
must be recognized that he is a whole.
However, through specializations such
as the laboratory, the surgery, nursing,
medicine, physical therapy, occupation-
al therapy, social service, recreation
service and others, the whole individual
is served more deeply because each
specialist has a particular depth of
knowledge in one area of learning. Once
upon a time a shoemaker made a whole
shoe. Today he makes a part and 'that
part makes a contribution to the whole.
There is more precision in making each
part even though the whole 'becomes less
personalized. So it is in our professions
———each profession makes a precise con-
tribution and great effort must be made
in a team-work approach to make sure
that a whole is achieved. Perhaps our
team work has not been perfected but
certainly our professional techniques
have been developed. The nurse has a
special contribution to make. Let us
hope that other professions will comple-
mcnt hers, leaving her free to do her job
while the recreation leader does his.
Recreation is not a treatment per se, it
is a re-creative experience in leisure-
time.

The Rhythmaster is the most unique instrument of its kind. With one
easy movement, the teacher, the director, or the coach, can slow down
a phonograph record to as little as 1/3 its normal tempo or speed it up
as much as 300 percent to suit the rhythm requirements of any activity.
This is because the Rhythmaster is the only instrument in which the
speed is continuously variable over the entire range from 25 to 100 rpm.
Moreover, only with the Rhythmaster can the speed be varied without
the need for resetting or stopping. It is designed for all records: 33-1/ 3,
45, and 78 rpm, up to and including 16 inches in diameter.

The Rhythmaster is a practical and eEective public address loudSpeaker
system as well. . . for indoors and outdoors. By simply connecting a
micrOphone, large as well as small groups can be addressed and directed,
even while the record is being played. In fact, the Rhythmaster is a
complete, self-contained high fidelity sound system which also serves as
a radio when connected to a tuner.

There isn’t a single activity. . . educational or recreational . . . which
cannot be mere effectively conducted with the REK-O-KUT Rhythmaster.
It is portable, and readily lends itself to any location . . . the class room,
the assembly hall, the gymnasium, the athletic field . . . indoors or
outdoors.

REK-O-KUT is world famous as a maker of professional disc recorders,
turntables, and phonographs. These products are used by broadcast
and recording studios, and among the nation's leading schools and
recreation centers.

) THE TASK 0F COMPILING A COMPRE-
HENSIVE LIST Of all community festivals
and celebrations tO be held during June,
July and August 1954, has been under-
taken by Theatre Arts magazine. A
special forty-page section of the May
issue will be devoted to this; and a large
folding map Of the United States, mark-
ed with location of each event, and di-
rections as tO how tO get there will be
included with the magazine. Theatre
Arts has asked us to request the assist-
ance of park and recreation executives
in securing such information from their
areas. Here is an opportunity for you
tO be of further service tO your commu-
nity by helping it secure national pub-
licity for its special events. Deadline is
March 20, so mail promptly tO NRA,
marked for attention Of Joseph Pren-
dergast.

) HOW TO CHOOSE TIIE RIGHT COL-
LEGE FOR YOUR RECREATION CAREER is
the topic Of a new and attractive leaflet
just published by the National Recrea-
tion Association. This is a result Of the
activities Of the Sub-committee on Un-
dergraduate Education, of the National
Advisory Committee on Recruitment,

Training and Placement of the NRA;
Charles K. Brightbill is chairman. Sin-

) THE NATIONAL CIIILD LABOR COM-
MITTEE celebrates its fiftiethannivers-
ary next month. In 1916 the first Fed-
eral Child Labor Law was enacted.
Marked changes have taken place dur-
ing these lifty years. In 1954, tO date,
twenty states have adopted sixteen- and
fourteen-year age standards in their
child labor laws, similar to those in the
federal law.

) THE OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL
STUDY COMMITTEE Of the Conference
for National Cooperation in Aquatics,

138

under the chairmanship Of George
Butler, is gathering information on the
design of outdoor swimming pools. The
study, when completed in 1954, will
help determine the relative merits Of
different pools and will give guidance
to communities in selecting the type,
size, depth and design of outdoor pools.

) THE FIRST REPORT TO THE GOVER-
NOR Of the Virginia Inter-Agency Com-
mittee on Recreation recommends that
funds be made available tO the Inter-
Agency Committee “to employ a full-
time executive secretary who would
have an adequate background in and
comprehensive philOSOphy of recrea-
tion.”

) A SPECIAL ORDINANCE passed by the
local city council in Niagara Falls, New
York, abolished the existing depart-
ment Of parks and recreation and cre-
ated a new Department Of Recreation.
A new Department of Public Service,
created by the same action Of council,
includes the former departments of en-
gineering, parks, sewage disposal, pub-
lic welfare, markets and water distri-
bution.

) ADOPTED AT A RECENT NORTH CARO-
LINA Recreation Society Conference,
was a resolution re-aliirming the aware-
ness of the society to the need for posi-

North Carolina Recreation Commission
that plans for the operation Of recrea-

could be put into operation immediately
should major disaster occur anywhere
within the state

) A TAPE RECORDING MUSIC CONTEST,
judging Of which will be held in con-
junction with National Music Week in
May 1954, is being conducted for a

) TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE JU-
DICIARY SUB-COMMITTE investigating
juvenile delinquency in Washington,
January 21, Joseph Prendergast. said
that the communities of the country
were to be commended for their efforts
to provide opportunity for juvenile de-
cency and to decrease opportunities for
juvenile delinquency through commu-
nity recreation programs.

Mr. Prendergast requested permis-
mission tO include in the records of the
hearing additional material, to be based
on letters from recreation executives
being received in reply tO his Newslet-
ter of January 11, and the notice in
RECREATION, February 1954, request-
ing concrete examples of the relation of
delinquency prevention tO recreation.

) YEAR-END SUMMARY OF SERVICE for
1953, from the Correspondence and
Consultation Service of the NRA shows
that more than 22,000 letter requests
and a thousand telephone requests for
information and guidance were met.
More than fifty per cent of the requests
came from municipal recreation depart-
ments. Almost one-fourth of all the re-
quests were concerned with facilities.
layout and equipment. Within this
group, most frequently inquiries were
on outdoor swimming pools. Questions
varied from the very general to specilic
inquIrIes.

Editorially Speaking

 

Day Camping

Day camping has now existed long
enough to be on the way to becoming
an old story. “There are variations in
particular details of day camping from
community to community, but what is
good day camp practice is clear and can
be framed in words, caught and set
down for guides to be used as points of
departure for establishing new pro-
grams or for revising old ones that have
somehow lost. sight of the functions
proper to them.

“If there is anything in a name, day
camping must provide some kind of
camping program. . . . It should offer
an opportunity for recreation and re-
laxation; physical and mental, social
and emotional growth; a challenge to
go adventuring beyond the limits of
everyday environments; the excitement
of new experiences, of new knowledge
come upon informally; a sense of secur-
ity and of well-being gained by achieve-
ment; an awareness of the self-suffici-
ency and the resourcefulness that lives
in every human being. All this day
camping should provide in the out-of-
doors. For the important emphasis in
day camping—the thing that relates it
to camping and distinguishes it from the
activities of the home, the community
center, or the playground—is the em-
phasis upon nature. Day camping is
recreation in the out-of-doors.

“Emphasis upon nature must be the
core of the day camp program. All ele-
ments of the program must spring from
it and lead back to it. To a child bound
to the city, nature is a great mystery, an
unlimited adventure. He will find in the
out-of-doors ‘dynamic adventure latent
in every common thing.’ This is his
birthright, traded for a mess of civiliza-
tion’s gadgets. To restore that heritage
to the child is a proper function of day
camping.”——From Day Camping, Na-
tional Recreation Association.*

Leisure Time

“A man dislikes being a slave to too
many gimmicks,” writes Robert C.
Ruark, in his column in the New York
World-Telegram and Sun. “He derives
a certain satisfaction from doing things
with his hands. I suppose it’s called
personal achievement.”

* * * *

Two recent issues of Business Week
were devoted to the new leisure market
and came to the conclusion that spend-
ing money for the new, increased leisure
time will vitally affect our future na-
tional economy. There is just so much
food, clothing, shelter and other neces-
sities of existence, but there is no fore-
seeable limit as to what will be needed
and can be used as leisure time in-
creases.

* * * *

Tide, the advertising magazine, re-
ported not long ago that the biggest
factor in our economy today is the revo-
lution in marketing resulting from the
impact of leisure-time living, the do-it-
yourself movement, and the shift to the
suburbs.

£1- 11- * *

“In taking stock of new economic facts
which must now be related to the recre-
ation movement,” Joseph Prendergast
told delegates to the Boston University
Recreation Workshop recently, “we
must consider carefully what this new
emphasis on leisure means to the lives
of every child and adult.

“Recreation has significance in rela-
tion to juvenile delinquency, to the de-
velopment of sound physical and men-
tal health, to wholesome family living
and even to the friendly relations of
countries in the international field.

“But the importance of providing real
recreation opportunity for millions of
Americans in order to satisfy their in-
creasing need for a creative use of lei-
sure is a challenge to recreation leaders

of the first magnitude.”

You Remember

Howard Brauchcr

YOU REMEMBER the watercress you
found by the stream, the chestnuts,
hickory nuts, walnuts, buttcrnuts, the
tiny beechnuts you gathered in the fall
after the frosts, the sassafras root, the
blucberries, the elderbcrries, thc wild gooseberries with their thorns.

 

YOU REMEMBER the smells-win the woods, in the swamps, in the pasture, by the
seashore, where the wild roses grcw, or the little island just thick with violets,

the smell of the clambake, the smell of the wood firc, the smell of the bayberry
you ground up in your hands.

You REMEMBER the nice fcel of the road dust on your bare feet, the good old
“squush” of the mud between your toes, wading in the crcek at recess, catching
tadpoles to be watched as they grew up, turning stones ovcr to find what lived

underneath, the first joy of swimming in the ocean, of giving yourself entirely to
the water.

You REMEMBER—if you lived away from the mountains—the first climbs, thc
delight of finding the springs you could drink from, coming on thc decr, watching
them bound away from you, getting above the timber line, above the clouds, and
whcn the sky cleared, seeing for milcs and .milcs.

You REMEMBER always thc birds, thc trees you climbed as a boy to study their
ncsts, the pheasants flying up, perhaps the wild turkeys, the dozen or so littlc
bobwhite following their mother on the ground, onc behind thc other, yct ncvcr
walking in a straight line, thc tiny hummingbirds always coming to the samc
place by thc side of the porch.

You REMEMBER many sounds—the sound of the sea when it is calm, the sound
of the sea in the winter storms on a rocky coast, the lapping of the lakc water at
your camp as you wake up in the morning, thc sound of the wind in thc trces,
the cry of the loon on the lake, the sound of the rushing mountain strcam, the

roar of the great falls, the sounds of myriads of insccts, the sound of the “jug-
ger-rum.”

I

You REMEMBER the sight of the first flowcrs, the wheat just coming out of the
ground, the trees leafing out in thc spring, the color of the leavcs in thc fall, the
first snowstorm, sunscts over the ocean or thc lakes that are unbelievable.

You LIKE Row TO REMEMBER that much of our land and water and their sights

and sounds and beauty withal belong to the pcople—deeded to them forevcr and
forcvcr.

gLOSE to six hundred lucky young-

sters from the sidewalks of New
York are doing their summer day camp-
ing on a new and permanent fifty-acre
woodland tract within the city limits but
far from its steaming pavements. This
year the children, between seven and
fourteen, soon will usher in the second
season of the Henry Kaufmann Camp-
grounds, the first day camp with a per-
manent site and facilities to be estab-
lished in the city by a private philan-
thropy. While central administration,
maintenance staff and program guid-
ance are offered by the Henry Kauf-
mann Campgrounds of the Federation
of Jewish PhilanthrOpies, each of the
four afliliated neighborhood centers
simultaneously uses the site, plans and
administers its own program.

When the new camping project was
opened last year, the federation viewed
it as a pilot experiment which, if suc-
cessful, could be a model for three
similar facilities circling the city and
serving most of the 3,500 youngsters
now enrolled in the federation’s day
camp program. The post-season evalua-
tion was so Optimistic that plans for a
second permanent camp are now well
under way.

To be sure, the children participating
in the Staten Island project last summer
were a mere handful from the more
than 100,000 children throughout New
York City who turn to day camps for
their summer recreation. But the ex-

MR. DANIEL S. SCHECIITER, an instruc-
tor at the Newark College of Engineer-
ing in New Jersey, has written numer-
ous articles on social welfare topics.

CI'I‘Y MY CAMPING

citing venture is viewed by social
workers and health department oili-
cials as a possible means to speed the
improvement of modern day camping
programs and standards in New York
City and elsewhere.

Even enthusiasts in the day camping
movement are disturbed about some
existent low standards in this field, in
widely separated geographical areas.
Many of the problems in day camping
stem from overcrowding and makeshift
activities which have accompanied its
sharply increased popularity in the last
decade. But with its mushrooming has
come additional understanding of its
value and role in child care. The idea
is no longer simply to take children off
the streets. It can and should be a group-
camping experience, encompassing al-
most everything but sleeping away from

‘home, for those youngsters who cannot

take long separation from family or
community or who need sustained,
supervised, all-summer care instead of
just two weeks in the country. The idea
behind the Henry Kaufmann Camp-
grounds—named for thecfoundation
which donated the funds for the site

 

of this $250,000 undertaking—is to

remove youngsters to a rural haven
close enough to the city to make twice-a-
day transportation feasible.

Each morning in July and August
they gather in groups of up to 150 at
the federation-affiliated community cen-
ters located in lower Manhattan and
Brooklyn, and board buses for their

island refuge. With the bus and ferry
ride combined, the campsite still can be
reached in one hour. The groups’ ex-
periences have indicated that such travel
time need not be fatiguing and, indeed,
that a variety of activities can be used
to keep children happily occupied and
relaxed. Quiet games, group singing,
story telling, discussions, program plan-
ning and even dramatic play have been
utilized to make travel educational and
pleasurable. Considerable time is al-
lowed for observation of historic spots.

Twenty-two federation-afliliated com-
munity centers are eligible to arrange
for the use of one of the campsites-—
or half .a site if that suffices—on a
seasonal basis. The agency which sends
the child also supplies his counselors
and arranges his program upon arrival.
The permanent campgrounds staff is
charged only with operational and
housekeeping reSponsibilities and with
directing a few key, coordinated activi-
ties. For instance, a nurse is on duty
to care for minor illnesses and injuries.
Perishable foods such as meat, milk and
ice cream are furnished in bulk and at
cost to units who request them far
enough in advance. Otherwise, each unit
supplies its own lunches. A swimming
pool director and his assistant oversee
the transient counselors patroling the
pool’s edge while their campers swim.
Here, as in certain other activities, the
rules laid down by camp director Monte
S. Melamed are enforced. At least half
the counselors accompanying each
group to the grounds must be on duty
at the pool while their charges are in
the water. Their responsibility begins
with ’ required soap
showers and includes shepherding their

superintendng

groups back to their units.

The roles of the nature and camp-
craft counselors are of paramount im-
portance in the experience of young-

wildlife identification, gardening, camp-

Iidual units. That’s part of the camp
)hilosophy: assistance but not domina-
ion by the permanent professional staff.

During most of the day, each agency
s on its own. It has its own unit with
l rustic-style shelter including storage
pace for clothing, teaching supplies and
:quipment, adequate toilet facilities (in-
iufiicient facilities often are a black
nark against day camps), showers and
lrinking fountains, play fields, a coun-
:il ring seating 150 and serving as a
‘theater in the round,” a campfire place
1nd craft facilities. Of course, each
lgency is eligible to use such central
’acilities as major athletic fields, the
hree ponds scattered around the camp
(too shallow for swimming but one of
.vhich, at least, may be used for boating
1nd fishing) , the 100- by 40-foot outdoor
swimming pool which may be lighted
1t night, the central ofiice and store
)uilding, and, of course, the surround-
ng woods and fields. Although the camp
s intended primarily for seasonal use
)y aleiated agencies, it has many other
1ses. Other social agencies also can ar-
range to use it on a daily basis for
:rips or picnics by organized groups
iix through sixteen years of age. Teen-
lgers, young adults and adults occupy it
luring evenings, weekends, or at other
imes when children are not camping.
Splash parties, campfires and cookouts,
swimming and athletic meets, and track

and field days have been held here by

teen-agers during the warm weather.
During the winter the camp has been
filled with sleigh riders, skiers and ice
skaters. During the school year, teachers
use it for field work in the teaching of
conservation, nature lore, crafts, out-
door and group living, forestry, geos
graphy and other subjects. It also
serves as a training ground for agency
staffs preparing to improve use of camp-
grounds in general, and is equipped to
handle various groups using it on a
limited basis for overnight and week-
end camping during the off-season.
While the Henry Kaufmann Camp-
grounds serves as a model toward which
other day camps may aspire, the board
of directors is constantly considering
how to improve it and day camping in
general. The problem in New York City
is especially acute. Of the 100,000 chil-
dren ranging in age from three to six-
teen years who use the New York City
private and voluntary summer day
camps, present laws protect only the
25,000 between ages of three and six.
In his message at the June dedication
ceremonies of the campgrounds, Milton
Weill, the federation president, urged
the following six-point program to raise
the standards of day camping:
(1) Provision by the park department
of camp ground facilities in its acquisi-
tion of new recreational sites on the
periphery of the city.
(2) Provision by the board of educa-
tion in its acquisition of new sites for
school buildings, in certain areas, for
sufiicient acreage to include day camp-
ing sites.
(3) Relaxation of the zoning laws to
permit day camps to operate within a
reasonable distance from the city.
(4) Relaxation of parkWay regulations
regarding bus travel» “on “state and
county parkways durih‘g'ce’rtain “hours
of the day, to make “possible quicker

travel to day camping sites and to make
feasible the utilization of country sites
removed from the heavily congested city
areas.

(5) Financial assistance from munici-
pal and state governments on a fee-
per-child basis to private philanthropic
agencies accepting as day campers chil-
dren under public care.

(6) Free transportation on publicly
and privately owned ferries and bridges,
a concession which New York City al-
ready has made.

To implement this program, Mr.
Weill recommended that city and state
ofiicials create a day camp commission
“that will have the power to regulate
and enforce basic standards for day
camps, and that it be composed of rep-
resentatives of the various departments
responsible for health and welfare
standards, representatives of the park
department and the board of educa-
tion.”

There is increasing recognition of the
fact that in good day camps youngsters
benefit from major camping facilities
and obtain the valuable social experi-
ence through being part of their own
small neighborhood group and even
smaller age group. The Henry Kauf-
mann Campgrounds is making possible
a day camping program that in almost
all respects, except sleeping away from
home, is a real country-coUnselor-camp
experience. It marks an important ad-
vance f0r all of day camping in its
struggle to come of age.

143

  
 
     
      

  

This material, reprinted from
the Handbook of Day Camping,
put out by the Chicago Park
District, gives how-to-do infor-
mation valuable to a successful
day camping program.

Walk along in a park where a day camp is going on and—-
look! A group of boys and girls are trailing along, gather-
ing dandelions as they go. The young leaves, they tell you,
are “lettuce” for their noon-day salad, the yellow heads
decoration for their camp table. As you approach the lagoon,
you see boys and girls fishing, while close by are other
campers seriously engaged in the business of putting finish-
ing touches to their fishing poles. Across the way—near
the playground—you can hear and, as you walk closer, you
can see youngsters making individual tin can stoves. (Come
early some morning this summer and you will be sure to
see, smell and maybe taste a breakfast cookout.) Listen!
Hear the singing? As you pass by the field house, there
on a grassy plot where the trees grow tall (do you see the
horse-chestnut?) the songsters are singing lustily as they
help their animal puppets make a bow—and “on with the
show!” What fun!

Program like this does not just happen. In the Chicago
Park District day camps, it is the planning by the recreation
staff which brings the fun of outdoor living-in-groups within
the reach of a maximum number of boys and girls.

What Is Day Camping?

A day camp, as the name implies, is camping by the day.
The campers come from home in the morning, live through-
out the day with companion campers of their own age level
and similar interests, and return home late in the afternoon

144

to rejoin their families. This cycle, starting each mornin
with family, reaching out to include camp life, and returnin
each afternoon to the family, makes day camping a cooper:
tive undertaking, in which parents and camp staff 5118]
the responsibility. Once the cycle is completed, there com:
another start—another day at camp planned to give tl'
youngsters fun and adventure; the group experience of li‘
ing, working, playing and planning‘together; opportunitic
to use known skills and learn new ones; new experiences i
the out-of-doors—experiences that lead to increased unde
standing and new appreciation of the world about us.

Why Day Camps?——Day camping is comparatively inexpel
sive and is, therefore, available to many children who othe
wise might be deprived of camping experience. Its low co
makes possible a longer camp period or season.

It frequently is of value as an introductory camp e:
perience, particularly for a child who, emotionally, is n1
ready to be away from his parents for any length of tin}

A day camp program is child-centered and outdoors-ce:
tered. In combination, these two forces indicate a progra:
keyed to conservation: conservation of children and 1
natural resources. .

When we consider the fact that a child’s summer of da
camping with us may be his only camp experience, we begi
to recognize our responsibility and the impact of our efior

in this field.

RECREATIO

'he Day Camp Season—-—The length of the day camp season
'aries in different park locations from six to seven weeks.
oznc of the parks operate a one-period, others a two-
)criod camp. The one-period camp serves the same campers
roughout the entire day camp season, whereas the two-
eriod camp is open to new registrants at the beginning of
re second period. The re-registration of campers from the
rst period is welcomed unless the number of new regis-
ants for the second period prevents it.

The opening date of day camps is determined largely by

e day of the week on which July the Fourth falls. Since

is is a variable factor, the first day of day camp is an-

unced each year in the Program Book of Activities issued
the Division of Recreation.

The camps, in general, operate Mondays through Fridays

om 9:30 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. Several camps, however, choose

1 schedule an afternoon-evening session once or twice a
ek, in order to make possible an evening get-together
or parents and campers and/or an after-dark campfire pro-
ram. Such variations in time schedules are made known
hen the campers register.
Who Are The CamperSP— Boys and girls ranging in age
from seven through twelve years. The majority of the
j‘oungsters live within walking distance of the park loca-
lions; a relatively small percentage come to camp by public
Ind/or private transportation. Some of the boys and girls
have had camp experience; some have not. The children
represent different nationality groups, different racial
groups, different religious backgrounds and varying eco-
nomic groups. There may be some who have physical
handicaps.

Few teen-agers register in our park day camps. We do not
attempt to change this condition, for we recognize that,
in general, youngsters in this age group wish for and perhaps
need the broader experience of camping farther from home.
Consequently, those teen-agers who show an interest in our
day camps are encouraged to become a part of the camps
through participation as junior counselors. Special training
prior to the opening of camp and opportunities for in-canip
training and consultation with adult leaders make it pos-
Iible for the teen-age counselors to carry their responsibilities
ercditably.

Personnel

Evcry employee in a park that operates a day camp is
considered an essential part of the camp staff. Following is
a listing, by title, of personnel who contribute to the over-
hll success of our day camp prOgram.

Park Supervisor
Playground Supervisor
Instructor, Arteraft

Our recreational personnel, with the exception of a small
percentage of summer leaders, is employed on a year-round
basis. This is an advantage in that the qualifications of
leaders are known and used as a guide in camp placement.
Proper placement—the right person in the right place-——is
important, for personnel, including volunteers, is one of

the most, if not the most significant factor in the success
of a camp.

Volunteer Counselors——The use of volunteers results in a
reduction in camper load per camp leader and this, in turn,
signifies better all-round camp program. This possibility is
worth investigating.

Possible sources for volunteer counselors are: mothers
and other adult relatives of campers; women who are mem-
bers of park recreation groups during the indoor season;
seniors-——young men and women—who have “grown up” in
park recreation groups; former teachers; former leaders in
Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, Girl Scouts; members of
church groups, garden clubs, social agencies.

Final acceptance of a volunteer should be on a selective
basis, effected through previous personal acquaintance
and/or personal interview. A definite commitment to a
time schedule is considered a “must.” So, too, are qualifica-
tions number one and number two which are presented in
the following section.

Qualifications Of All Personnel—They should:

1. Like children and adults; have ability to work with them.

2. Enjoy outdoor living.

3. Be emotionally mature.

4. Have good health.

5. Have ability to work cooperatively with other members

of staff.

Be tolerant, considerate, fair-minded.

. Be interested in contributing to the achievement of the
objectives of the camp.

8. Have skills and abilities for specific responsibilities they

are to carry.

In addition to the above qualifications, the executive
director and the camp director should have the following:
1. Experience in administration and in working with

«1.0

groups.
2. Skill in the supervision of staff.
3. Initiative, resourcefulness and sense of responsibility.
4. Some previous experience in outdoor activities or
camping.
Staff Responsibilities-Assignment to camp duties entails
a temporary change in responsibilities and title. The tabula-
tion below shows possible distribution of jobs by titles that
identify them.

Job Descriptions—J ob descriptions, because they itemize in
detail what is expected of each staff member, help the indi-
vidual leader and the whole camp function more happily
and efficiently. Indication, in the job analysis, of the rela-
tionship of each specific position to the total camp prOgram
is essential as an aid in bringing about the cooperation of

145

all staff in the performance of all camp duties. If, for any

reason, adjustments in ob analyses are indicated, the matter

is referred to the staff for discussion and action.

The responsibilities of camp staff of various classifications
are likely to vary in different camps. A suggested division
of responsibilities follows.

Executive director should:

1. Have thorough understanding of day camp operation.

2. Promote day camp program through distribution of
camp folders, posters, talks before community organi-
zations.

3. Develop, through conference with area supervisor, camp
director and counselors, the policies and general objec-
tives of the camp; determine the location of the camp
site; set the camp fee.

4. Collaborate with day camp staff in planning and present-

ing pre-camp and in-camp training courses.

. Be aware at all times of what is going on in camp.

. Collaborate with day camp director and assistant day

camp director in administering the camp, making reports
and evaluations.

@011

Day camp director should:

1. Develop through staff conferences the objectives for
camp and ways of carrying them out. _

2. Collaborate with executive director and staff in planning
and presenting pre-camp and in-camp training courses.

3. Cooperate with executive director and staff in adminis-
tering the camp and in making inventories, reports and
evaluations.

4. Organize and supervise program, equipment, facilities.

5. Work directly with children’s group or groups in capac-
ity of counselor.

6. Interview parents and prospective campers before, or
at time of, registration.

Assistant day camp director should:

1. Take over responsibilities in the absence of day camp
director. '

swimming.

4. Information and exhibits—Resource materials; COD]-
munity resources and how to make use of them.

Pro-Camp Preparation

Explore the campsite for program possibilities and to
ascertain maintenance needs.
Camp Records—Review records of previous years (consult
area supervisor and predecessor for additional information
and suggestions). Check inventories of equipment and
materials.
Day Camp Calendar—Establish dates and hours for registra-
tion period (early registration aids in program planning) ;
establish opening and closing dates; set daily schedule.

RECREATION

r

Publicity—Release public1ty: Include camp location, ad-
dress and telephone number; park supervisor’s name; day
camp calendar; camp fee. Mail cards to former campers.
Confer with school principals; provide them with publicity
foldcrs for bulletin board purposes.

Community Relations—Write or visit, personally, repre-
sentativc members of local churches, schools, parent-
teachers” groups, civic organizations, local and metropolitan
newspapcrs, radio stations and local theaters. Prepare posters
and fiyers for distribution.

Milk—Make arrangements with reliable dairy for scheduled
delivery of milk.

Requisitions—The park supervisor submits a requisition to
thc area supervisor for the following materials and equip-
ment.

Post cards Pencils Blotters
Postage stamps Paper clips Receipt books
' Letter heads Ink Storage cabinets
Envelopes Pens Financial journal
Erasers Thumb Tacks Carbon paper

Work Orders—Approximately one month prior to the open-
ing of camp, submit written requests for necessary main-
tenance relating to camp grounds; also, for the delivery and/
or placcment of benches, logs for the council ring, canoes,
life preservers, archery targets, cookout grills, fishing poles,
sand in sand-pits, athletic equipment, directional signs.
Equipment and Materials—Unpack and list items left over
from previous year. Arrange in storage cabinets. Order
neccssary equipment and materials as soon as needs are
known.
Camp A pparel—The camp fee, in some camps, is planned to
include the cost of such articles as “T” shirts—marked with
name of the camp—gob hats—a different color for differ-
ent units—camp bags with identifying numbers.
As soon as quantities and sizes are ascertained at the time

' of registration, the articles should be ordered, so that distri-
bution may be made on the first day of camp or very soon
thereafter.
Trips—Ascertaiu cost of contemplated trips via bus (be
sure to deal with a bonded company). Reserve dates for
scheduled trips.

I Health Examinations—Arrange, if possible, with local doc-
tors for free medical and dental examinations of campers
who cannot afford to pay for them.

' Medical Report Forms—For the protection of the camper
and the camp, each child should be required to submit a
I medical report authorized by a registered physician, certi-
fying that the camper is or is not physically fit to participate
in an active day camp program.
Absentee Forms—Absentee forms, printed or mimeo-
graphed on United States post cards are an essential office
item (for notification to parents or guardian whenever a
child is absent).
Instructions for Campers—A mimeographed copy of de-
tailed instructions given to each campcr at the time of regis-
tration will be an informative guide for children and
parents that should facilitate easy adjustment to day camp
program.
Professional Material—Obtain from the Special Library,
Burnham Park and from the Chicago Park Library printed

materials on day camping, nature crafts, dramatics, games,
waterfront activities, artcrafts, Indian lore, outdoor living.

Program

Pre-Planning—The day camp program should be pre-
planned in terms of the over-all objectives of the camp and
program possibilities. Objectives are considered from three
points of view: ,

1. The campers. Each looks forward to fun with other
children, to learning new skills, to belonging in a group.
2. The parents. Their aims in sending their childrcn to
camp °coincide with those of the children, but they extend
to include physical, mental and social development and ap-
preciation of the outdoors.

3. The camp staff. Their goals parallel the aims of the
parents, but are analyzed more definitely in terms of pro-
gram activities that produce appreciations and other in-
tangibles.

These objectives are guide lines to the staff in building
and carrying on all phases of program.

As a first step in program development—prior to the
opening of day camps—staff members work together to plan
program possibilities:

I. They analyze their particular camp situation into its
components and interpret each factor in its relation to pro-
gram possibilities.

Campers: Consideration should be given to age, sex,.
interests, interest span, physical development. Have they
had previous camping experience?

Camp Staff: How many staff members in proportion to
campers? What specific teaching abilities does each staff
member'have? What new activities can staff members Icarn
to teach (through pre-camp and in-camp training) ?

Camp Site: What specific resources stimulate program?
(Swimming pool, sand pit, trees, birds, insects, flower
gardens, weeds.)

Community: Is it a home community of beautiful trees
and lovely gardens? Is there a public library—and possible
story teller service? Is it an industrial neighborhood? Make
arrangements to use the facilities for explorations.

Materials and equipment: Kinds and availability of ma-
terials and equipment are important factors in determining
program.

Camp Fund: Individual camper fees and programs are
to some extent inter-dependent; one may limit the other.
The camper fee is set in terms of program needs and the
total of all camper fees constitutes the camp fund, which is
used one hundred per cent for camp program purposes.
2. Camp staff makes a list of activities they consider worthy
of inclusion in the camp program.

3. The staff members together select activities that will
achieve the over-all objectives of the camp. They emphasize:
activities that are best carried on in the outdoors; those that
produce understanding and appreciation of nature; those
that produce group spirit—in planning together, singing,
cooking, group games, competitive stunts.

4. The camp staff selects and schedules program highlights
such as a nature field day, a birthday party, a progressive
cookout (each unit plans, prepares and serves one course to

147

all other units).
5. The staff members include parent’s night or family night
in the program plan—if not on a weekly basis, at least
twice during a camp period of six weeks.

6. The entire camp staff checks the pre-program plan. Is it
recreational, educational and health promoting? Does it
provide for rest periods, for progression in activities? Does
it include a definite plan for the first day or first few days
of camp, for use before the campers are well enough or-
ganized to help with the planning?

Final Test—Does the pre-
planned program indicate
the probable achievement of
camp objectives — objec-
tives of the campers, par-
ents and camp staff?

Why Pro-Plan Program?—
A Program Guide developed
by staff members is helpful
in many ways:

1. lt defines the goals of
the day camp program and

presents concrete sugges-

 

tions for the attainment

thereof.
2. When camp opens, the
program outline for the

Indian pageantry programs
like this “don’t just happen.”

first day of camp (included in the program guide) acts as
a starter for camp activities. It helps everyone off to an
excellent beginning.

3. Participation in the step-by-step development of the pro-
gram guide i1nbues the staff members with confidence in
their ability to offer program suggestions, to lead program
activities, to guide campers in planning daily program,
to adapt program to change in conditions.

Unit Organization—Division of the campers into groups or
units, based on age, interests and camping experience, is a
program aid that should be effected on the first day of
camp.

It is a device that gives children an Opportunity to create
a unit-home where they may live together all day in the
open; an opportunity to plan and, because the group is
small, have a voice in planning activities; and an oppor-
tunity to carry out these activities.

One or more adult counselors work with a unit in plan-
ning activities for the following day, and participate with
them in carrying out these daily plans. The children in a
given unit check in every morning and out every afternoon
with their unit counselor.

On their first day together in their unit-home, the campers
select a name—the name, perhaps, of a favorite tree within
the campsite, or, if they are lndian-theme campers, they
may adopt an Indian name. ‘

Other Than Unit Activities

Cutting Across Unit Lines—Unit lines are crossed when
members of specific interest groups gather, from the various
units, to follow through on a given project. Or, one entire
unit will combine with another for some special activity.

148

Also, there are many all-camp activities in which all units
and camp staff participate. At least two of these—the open-
ing and the closing assembly—are scheduled daily.

Daily Program—As discussed under Pre-planning Pro-
gram, the camp staff follows a tentative program plan for
the first few days of camp. As soon as the counselors become
acquainted with the campers, and the campers come to know
each other well enough to talk and plan together, campers
and counselors 000perate in planning a daily unit-program.

In addition to the unit plan for daily program, the camp
staff and campers develOp a daily guide which schedules the
routine phases of program, the use of facilities and equip-
ment and the highlights of the current camp period.

After camp starts, program is planned by camper groups
———units, all-camp program committee, and committees for
specific activities; stajjt groups—in cooperation with camper
groups, and in all-staff meetings, unit meetings, unit-staff
meetings; committees—from camper and staff groups, to
carry out special plans.

Evaluation of Program—This must be continuous through-
out the day camp season. lt is the responsibility of the park
supervisor, ca1np staff and campers. A final appraisal should
be made as soon as possible after the close of the season. The
accumulated data will be invaluable in making plans for
the following year.

Program Hints—Provide for progression in camp activities,
in order to assure new goals and the continued interest of
repeater-campers. Do not over-program. Allow for leisure-
liness that will, in turn, allow each camper to set his own
pace and have some time to do the things he most wishes
to do. Remember that the program plan is only a plan——
subject to change when interests and conditions indicate
a change.

Campkeeping

This is comparable to housekeeping at home. It includes
daily work obs geared to keeping the unit living quarters
and camp headquarters clean and orderly. These work jobs
—commonly known in camp as “kapers”—are divided
among all the campers; workers are assigned to jobs in
pairs, small groups or patrols. A unit counselor works with
the patrols. ln sharing the responsibility of maintenance,
campers develop a sense of “belonging” and of pride in
their camp. All campkeeping groups work, in turn, at all
work jobs.

What are the essential kapers? Who, specifically, is
responsible for carrying them out? These questions are dis-
cussed by campers and camp staff; the conclusions are
recorded on a “kaper chart,” which shows day-by-day job
assignments.

It is suggested that a kaper chart, detailing chores per-
taining to the entire camp, be posted on the bulletin board at
camp headquarters; that a chart, detailing unit and perti-
nent all-camp chores be posted at each unit site.

Campkeepers should observe the park groundsmen as they
work, get acquainted with them and c00perate in keeping
camp areas clean and orderly. Such participation will lead to
an understanding of maintenance problems, appreciation of
outdoor beauty and deve10pment of civic pride.

RECREATION

Dan iel E. Wagner

WHETHER it be resident or day

camping 1 am sure that everyone

in the recreation field is in agreement
that each and every child should have
the opportunity to enjoy the fun of
camping in some form, and that when-
ever it is within the power of the recrea-
tion staff to accomplish that objective,
it should make the most of the oppor-
tunity. The chance to serve a group,
heretofore unserved, presented itself to
the Dayton Division of Recreation early
in the summer of 1953. I received a tele-
phone call from Dr. H. H. Williams,
health commissioner, who asked me if
we could provide a day camp site and
a day camp program for a group of
diabetic children. To this I replied that
wc could do so and would be very happy
to collaborate in such an experiment.
Dr. Williams, and others of us in
municipal service have been concerned
about the limited recreational oppor-
tunities available to handicapped
groups, and it was he who conceived
the idea that a day camp program might
bc provided for diabetic or even car-
'diac cases. After his contact with me, he
proceeded to talk with Dr. Thomas P.
Sharkey, a local specialist in the dia-
betic field, about the possibility of such
a venture. Dr. Sharkey, who is very
much aware that many such youngstcrs
miss the fun that accompanies thc
“growing-up” process, because they live
a rather sheltered life, was most enthusi-

astic about the idea and expressed his
willingness to contribute his efforts to
its successful promotion.

Arrangements were made to call to-
gether a group of people who were in—
terested and who would be involved. Dr.
Sharkey, representing the Montgomery
County Medical Society; Mrs. Barbara
Ort, city nutritionist; Mrs. Hannah Bla-
lock, a dietitian. representing the Dayton
Dairy Council; Mary Heiland and Mrs.
Henry Stout representing the American
Red Cross Motor Corps and Canteen
Services, also Mrs. Walker, A.R.C.
dietitian; and myself representing the
Dayton Division of Recreation. The
campsite was not equipped with cook-
ing or refrigeration equipment, and the
Frigidaire Company loaned us a stove
and refrigerator for the kitchen. Dr.
Williams related to this group the re-
sults of research, indicating the exist-
ence of a few resident camps for dia-
betic children, but no record of any day
camp programs in operation. Here was
an opportunity to pioneer in a new
field. The assemhled group accepted the
challenge wholeheartedly and immedi-
ately began to make plans.

The Red Cross agreed to furnish
daily transportation to and from the
camp. Its Canteen Service agreed to
furnish some kitchen utensils mid
several volunteers each day to prepare
the food. The Dairy Council agreed to
furnish the food. The Montgomery
County Medical Society offered its ser-
vices through its member physicians,
so that a doctor would he in attendance
each day. A number of registered
nurses contributed their services. The
parks division volunteered to get the
location ready, and the division of
recreation furnished a recreation in-

structor for supervision of the recrea-
tion program—and the necessary ma-
terials and equipment. These people
held several planning and orientation
conferences prior to the actual opera-
tion.

The site selected for the camp was a
beautiful wooded tract of fifty acres of
virgin timber owned by the City of
Dayton and approximately ten miles
south of the city. Registration limit was
set at fifteen since this was an explora-
tory experiment for which we had no
past experience with which to compare
——from any source. The ages of the
children served were hetween ten and
thirteen, and registrations were ac-
cepted from anywhcre in the county.
Dietitians received and recorded the
physical prescriptions for each child,
and we were ready to start.

The children met at a central loca-
tion daily where they boarded Red
Cross station wagons at 9 A.M., arriving
at the camp at 9:30 A.M. A normal day
camp program of activities was con-
ducted, since' the physicians recom-
mended that the participants be treated
in a normal manner insofar as the pro-
gram itself was concerned. The recrea-
tion instructor had been briefed on
symptoms, and was ahle to detect in-
sulin reactions to which he would call
the physician’s attention. After mid-
morning feeding and a medical-check,
an active program of physical activities
was scheduled. Lunch was followed by a
rest period, then instruction was given
in simple handcrafts. The craft period
was followed by games and contests
before closing the program for the day.
On several occasions, an Open campfire
was built and the children had the fun
of preparing their own meal, according

149

to their individual food requirements.
At four o’clock each day the station
wagons again loaded their passengers
for the return trip to the city. The pro-
gram operated daily, Monday through
Friday, for a two-week period.

The committee and all of the volun-
teers engaged in the program were more
than pleased with the results of the
experiment and began formulating
more ambitious plans for the season of
1954, even to the extent of providing

overnight sleeping accommodations.
The possibility of doing the same thing
for cardiac cases is under consideration
with the probability that this will also
be attempted in the 1954 season. The
entire program was provided without
any cost whatever to the participant. The
Dayton Rotary Club will financially
sponsor the 1954 program.

One of the most gratifying results of
the eXperiment was the manner in which

the children adjusted to group condi-

an Opinion of recreation personnel.

Camping is a vital part of our Ameri-
can heritage. As a summertime activity
it has long been accepted as valuable
for a relatively small group of children.
According to a statement of the Ameri-
can Association of School Administra-
tors, 1nade in 1945, only about five per
cent of the girls and boys enrolled in
public and private schools in these
United States had some type of camp
experience. In this small group are the
children whose parents.can afford to
pay well for the summer vacation ex-
perience and others who are sent to
camp as guests of charitable groups in-
terested in the health of underprivileged
children. Some children are too young
for an extended camp experience, but
more than half could profit not only
physically but socially, emotionally and
intellectually from a camp eXperience
which aims to do more than to enter-
tain or even to transplant to the woods,
or the open country, activities which
children can enjoy in a city.

There are numerous direct learning

eXperiences in the camp program. In
addition, however, there are many
more concomitant learnings of which
the child is not aware and which are
equally important in the education of
the total child.

The Chico Recreation District day
camp program handles an average of
sixty-five children per day for a week’s
camp eXperience each, and operates for
six weeks. The children are taken to
the campsite in Bidwell Park by school
bus each morning at 9:00 A.M. and re-
turned to town at 4:30 P.M. 0n Thurs-
day this schedule varies so that the bus
leaves town\ at 6:00 A.M. for a Bird
Watch and returns at noon. On Friday
the bus leaves at noon and returns after
a campfire program at 8:00 P.M., to
which all parents are invited.

'One of the first aims of the camp
program is to live close to nature, to
do so pleasantly, healthfully and com-
fortably. Therefore, nature study and
nature lore is considered the most im-
portant part of it. Last ,year the program
included pioneer and Indian lore, hik-
ing, nature study, crafts, fire making,
cooking, singing, dramatics, story tell-
ing and swimming. Some specific acti-
vities were bird, reptile, butterfly and
insect study, trees and shrubs, com-

tions, as most of them had eXperienced
these only in school classrooms or under
the watchful supervision of their pa-
rents. The parents, themselves, were
well pleased with the individual results
and cooperated with the committee in
every way possible. The experiment
provided one more opportunity wherein
the public health and recreation
agencies were able to work coopera-
tively on a project for the welfare of
the public in our community.

 

pass work, map making, conservation.

Indirectly, the campers learn group
living, outdoor good manners, cleanli-
ness, the care of our parks and pro-
tection of our natural resources.

We believe that there is a large carry-
over in knowledge among our campers,
which in future years will tend toward
an awareness and appreciation of our
public park areas, whether they be city,
county, state or federal.

Why our camp program is valuable:
1. To the recreation district—a healthy
recreation program, highly approved
of by campers, parents and the com-
munity.

2. To the park department—a dissem-
ination of knowledge and appreciation
of our parks which will tend to reduce
vandalism.

3. To the parents——a healthy, happy
child with many new interests.

4. To the child—new ideas, skills,
friends and an appreciation of nature.
5. To the community—children who
become better citizens.

The success of this .activity, I believe,
is in keeping the camp program keyed
to nature, and continued development
of good learning situations.

RECREATION

o Hardly has one National Recreation Congress ended but
the next one begins. Sure enough, immediately after the
Philadelphia Congress a questionnaire was sent to all those
who attended, and replies have been received from a large
number to help those of us responsible for planning the
St. Louis Congress.

It is gratifying to note that more than fifty per cent of
those supplying information attended the Philadelphia
Congress at no expense to themselves personally. The per-
ccntage was about the same for Philadelphia as for Seattle
a year before. This represents recognition by public and
private agencies of the value of the Congress. The corres-
ponding fact that many can attend and do so only by paying
part or all of the cost personally is also a tribute to thc
Congress program and constantly challenges those who work
on the Congress year after year.

Again this year the “Rough Draft” was well-received, and
those responding to the questionnaire were three to one in
favor of it. The fact that a fourth of those replying still
seem to remember, favorably, the summary sessions of the

. past is of interest, especially since many who responded
this year probably never attended a Congress where these

_ were presented orally at the morning general sessions.

I Several of the questions related to the subject of general
sessions and, by a great majority, the delegates seem to
feel that eight-thirty is a good starting hour for the evening
sessions. The few who suggested starting somewhat later
were outnumbered by those wanting to start before that
hour. As at most large gatherings there has been a tendency
for delegates to arrive for general sessions later than the
scheduled hour. Several suggestions were submitted for

I helping to encourage promptness, frequently including the

I comment that if the meetings began- right on the dot,

I delegates would soon mend their ways and be on hand.

One delegate took special pains to analyze Congress

| tardiness, and he reported about as follows: Delegates are

lI obviously late because they want to eat at interesting and

I popular restaurants. This is a good thing; but delegates lose
all track of time during the busy Congress days, and plan-
ning must be done for them. If we want them at a general
session at eight-thirty, this means that they must be in the
vicinity by eight o’clock or eight-fifteen. We must allow

I two to two and a half hours for dinner, slow service and

, taxis. This means that the delegate must leave the hotel

' for dinner not later than six. Allowing half an hour for bath
'or shower and change of clothes takes us back to five-thirty.
'Since delegates like to chat for at least an hour or look at the
exhibits after a session, the meetings should close at four
and the exhibit area should close at five-thirty instead of
six. “This will force us,” he concludes, “to keep on schedule
without hurrying anyone.” What are your comments?

There was strong evidence of desire for more free time
at the Congress, without too specific agreement on just
what should be omitted. A gratifying number remarked on
the high calibre of the addresses in Philadelphia. Some felt
prominence and reputation of speaker were less important

than ability to make a good speech. Others thought that
prominent people need educating in the field of recreation
and that asking them to speak is a good way to educate.

There was practically unanimous support of the idea
that the chairman of a section meeting has a great deal to
do with its success. There was also strong sentiment in favor
of better preparation for program responsibilities on the
part of panel members—or discussion leaders. And a heavy
vote was cast for making as much time as possible available
for discussion from the floor. There was some interesting
difference of opinion between those who thought recreation
administrators should chair all section meetings and those
who thought that recreation administrators did not neces-
sarily make the best chairmen.

Specific suggestions of topics are most helpful to those
who are ultimately responsible for setting up the section
meetings. A wide range of topics has been suggested in
response to the questionnaire and in letters commenting
on the Philadelphia meeting. Topics which could not be
included in that program will also need to be reconsidered
this year; and the St. Louis Local Arrangements Commit-
tee and the Midwest District Advisory Committee will
doubtless have specific topics to suggest. Others who want
to make nominations are urged to do so immediately, spell-
ing out their ideas as specifically as possible.

It is evident from the suggestions received that there is
'continuing hunger for discussion of old-age problems, public
relations, personnel problems, finances, sports and athletics.
It was even suggested that the same topics discussed at
Philadelphia be discussed all over again. In addition to these
topics which are old friends, a few new topics have been
submitted and many more will be welcomed. What are the
new developments in program, areas and facilities, adminis-
tration?

Much study will need to be done by the many Congress
committees in the weeks immediately ahead. With the
cooperation of those who have ideas and who are willing
to share them, we hope to present soon an outline of 3
Congress program which will come even closer to satisfying
the needs of the delegates than we have been able to do in
the past.

Mr. Pomeroy pointed out1 the fact
that most modern cities—all of them,
perhaps—actually are made up of the
old and the new alike. I would like to
further broaden our idea of the “mod-
ern city.” If, therefore, you find me
wandering from what might be called
the big city out into the suburbs, it is
only because the big city is wandering
out there itself.

I recently had a fine lesson concern-
ing two pairs of distinctions which will
be the twin subjects of my remarks
here. The first of these distinctions is
between policies and measures for
carrying them out.

tions began one day when I motored
through some rural areas where farm-
ing was going on. I was stopped by a
warning sign along the road which said
“Watch Out For Trucks.” It made me
look over to the left of the highway,
where I saw what had been a big farm
being cleared and an industrial plant
being started. This was many miles
away from the city, but the plant was
clearly part of the big city industrial
economy.

Now, there was just that sign along
the road to warn that something was
coming. The next time I came by, how-
ever, the plant was nearly completed.
It had been opened for work and there
was so much more traffic that they had
painted paving markings to show where
trucks and cars were coming in and
out. There was a complicated lane
system painted on the paving, to sepa-
rate automobiles that were going
straight ahead from the automobiles—
and there were lots of them—crossing
the opposing traffic into the plant.

Some time later when I passed that way
again, it was evident that the pavement
markings had been found insufficient
because of the very large numbers of
vehicles using the growing intersection.
The paving markings had been replaced

a while because the next time a traffic
light had been added to the channel
markings.

Then one day, quite early in the
morning, when the shifts were coming
on and off, there was so much traffic
that not even the channeling and the
traffic light were sufficient for safety.
A policeman was out there directing
traffic. The last thing that I found was
a big overpass spanning the highway.
It had been constructed in such a way
that there was no longer any problem
of crossing traffic. Vehicles were fully
separated.

You will note that in the various i11-
stallations that were tried by the muni-
cipality where the factory was located,
some of the things cost very little money
ust the cost of paint or the relatively
small cost of a traffic light. The final
bridge put there, however, cost a great
deal of money. I will return a little later
to this distinction: the fact that some
types of improvement cost very little
money and if they prove insufficient
they can be replaced with other things

RECREATION

that also cost little money; whereas
there are other types of improvement—-
and the overpass is one example—so
exPensive that they should be under-
taken only when the need is very defi-
nite and when it is also very clear that
the facility built will take care of the
need.

Each time I passed by the factory,
I noticed other changes along the road,
changes taking place in the countryside
around the factory. The mansions on
a hillside, looking down over the big
farm area, had in recent years been in-
habited by commuters. Then some lunch
wagons and shanties sprang up along
the sides of the road, initially to serve
the Workers who were building the
plant. Later these were converted into
stores to serve the employees of the
plant, because it was far away from any
shopping center with existing stores and
cafeterias.

Next, the surrounding farmland was
being cut up into lots; and because of
the kind of employment in the plant the
lots were small. Fields and woods in
which boys had romped for many
generations now became paved areas
and front lawns. One day there was a
minor flood because all the roofs and
driveways were shedding water rapidly,
whereas what they replaced—the farm-

 

land—-—had soaked up water as quickly
as it fell.

One could see that enormous changes
had been brought about by the decision
of somebody to build the factory. The
farm country had given way to a species
of urban development. Traffic had in-
creased on all the roads. These now
were congested by large numbers of
people coming and going hy automobile
and bus and by large and small trucks.

Land values had been greatly changed
in the area too. The amount of space
customary for each house had become
very much diminished. Where formerly
no organized recreation program had

MARCH 1954

been thought necessary because man,
woman or child could walk outside the
house and have all the space wanted for
recreation, now there was an extensive
urban area, and one had to go quite a
distance to reach a place where a ball
could be thrown without danger of
breaking a window.

There was a rural school nearby and
its educational program had been
changed by this factory’s coming. They
still provided education for some chil-
dren who intended to go on to college,
but now trade school education was
demanded, and they were giving over
part of the school to machine-shop edu-
cation and the like. And, of course, an
area that had never had a recreation
problem of any kind suddenly realized
that here was a recreation problem with
a capital R. The problem of a recreation
field for employees, during their lunch
hour in the summer, reared its head, and
many other recreation problems were
brought about simply by someone’s de-
cision to put a plant there.

Now, the kind of question that was
involved in the factory’s coming to that
place, it seems to me, is quite different
from the question of whether to start
off by putting a traffic light up or by
painting lines on the paving. In the lat-
ter instance the expense involved is low,
and it is easy to correct a mistake if one
is made; so the normal procedures of
settling such matters in a municipality
are adequate. On the other hand, the
decision to re-zone land so as to permit
a factory where there had been none—
where the area had always been thought
of as having a residential or a farming
future—that decision is one for which
the normal day-to-day processes of gov-
ernment are inadequate. We must find
some way of settling this kind of major
policy question by a procedure which
will involve more people in the com-
munity than just a group of five or
seven trustees or councilmen who meet
routinely and dispose of business in
rapid order.

What is the normal procedure for

settling local governmental questions? c

If it is a matter of a traffic light,
some commissioner—the commissioner
of public safety, let’s say—draws up an
ordinance and proposes it; the ordi-
nance is introduced into a session of the
council; there is a public hearing adver-

tised in very small print on the very
back page of the paper, or even the
page next to the back which is even
more obscure; then there is a public
hearing with a few people possibly
hearing about it; a vote is taken and
the matter is disposed of.

I believe that kind of proccdure
wholly inadequate for the settling of
problems—and the factory is only one
of many examplcs—that really involve
change in the whole character of a
community. For such kinds of ques-
tions, more extensive means are neces-
sary.

I mentioned, as an illustration, the
question of whether or not to bring a
factory into an area. I did not mean
to indicate by my remarks that it is
unwise: I just meant that it means great
change. Sometimes great change is
necessary. Sometimes, quite the con-
trary!

The bor0ugh of Princeton, New Jcr-
sey, employed a planning consultant to
help with a new zoning ordinance. A
series of local, informal meetings were
held to sound out public opinion on
what sort of thing citizens wanted
Princeton to become. Very lengthy de-
bates ensued. People from Princcton
University expressed the things that
they wanted of the borough in order to
make Princeton the kind of educational
institution it should be. Merchants ex-
pressed their desires. With a competing
shopping center imminent not far from
the borough, the merchants wanted to
have parking facilities built in the
borough so as to be able to compete
successfully. Homeowners expressed
their desires.

When all the desires had been ex-
pressed, somebody summed them up by
saying, “You know, it sounds to me as
if most everybody wants Princeton to
be the way it was in 1950.” A city
planner who was present, said rather
sensibly, “You have just stated what
should be the guiding policy for regula-
tion in Princeton.” He went on, “We
normally think of a master plan as a
map with future streets and with future
land uses and with future parks. I think
that the master plan of Princeton ought
to start with a statement, ‘It is intended
for Princeton to be the way it was in

1950.’ ” That sounds kind of backward,
but the more you think of it in relation

153

to Princeton, the more you see the
statement as a very sound policy and
a policy that enables other decisions to
be made.

Nobody should fool himself into

thinking such a decision means that
nothing needs to be done. When you
think about it, great numbers of things
need to be done if a good community
is to remain a good community. But this
is an example of a policy. The advantage
of having recognized the policy is that
it now makes clear what to do about
various other matters—zoning, land
control, recreation, schools, and so on.

I could illustrate this general kind
of policy setting with a great many
other things: (1) whether to have in-
dustry or not; (2) whether each lot
should have open space on it for recrea-
tion or should be closely landscaped,
recreation for little children to be pro-
vided on municipal areas scattered amid
the residential sections;- and (3)
whether the community should distri-
bute the population evenly on large
lots all over town or should zone for
concentration of houses and apart-
ments on smaller lots so that large
remaining areas can retain a country-
like flavor.

There is the policy question faced in
.one community in the New York metro-
politan region—Mountain Lakes—
“‘How fast should we grow?” They de-
cided that, in order to have‘the com-
munity deve10p at the pace they felt
proper, they should buy up all the land
available for subdivision. The borough
bought about a third of its territory
and they have made that third into a
big borough reserve. Occasionally they
sell lots from it when a need for more
houses is recognized. The policy they
established was that the Mountain
Lakes area should remain a country-
like place; that they wanted to preserve
some of the land without anything built
on it, on the good reasoning that by
taking some of the land off the tax rolls
for recreation areas, the other land

would contribute more and thus more

than offset it.

I could illustrate this principle—that
policy must precede measures to carry
it out—in the recreation field also. I
was reading a chapter on recreation, and
I found the principle very well expressed
by'someone writing in your field. He

154

was calling attention to the fact that
fifty or sixty years ago the private
agencies in each community and people
in families on their own land carried
the major burden of whatever rccrea-
tion facilities were needed. But, in
modern times, with the outward exten-
sion of large cities, people cannot just
go out for a short walk and be in the
country. Open land has become scarce
in the very places it is most needed.

He says: “Provision of space and
large-scale. facilities has become widely
accepted as  primary responsibility of
public recreation units. It is no longer
appropriate 'for private philanthropy to
supplement this facility provision ex-
cept as occasionally a group of citizens
contribute to acquire property for
transfer to public authorities to oper-
ate. This function is appropriately one
for tax and bond issue support, namely,
the provision of adequate open space
for recreation.

“The reasons underlying this prin-
ciple are quite clear. Public bodies pos-
sess certain powers of condemnation
which enable them to acquire property
needed for development. In many cases
location and acquisition of these facil-
ities is an integral part of other public
planning, such as planning for high-
ways, schools, industrial development,
and zoning. Above all, it is now diffi-
cult, if not impossible,‘to finance their
acquisition, development and main-
tenance through private“ resources.”2

Thus, he poses a key policy deci-
sion that a community has to make: the
question, how much to depend on pri-
vate recreation sources, and how much
on public, needs to be considered by the
whole community. Once decided, of
course, it clarifies what is to be done
by local government.

 

2Bradley Buehl and associates, Community
Planning for Human Services (New York;
Columbia University Press, 1952), p. 379.

Another major policy matter in the
field of recreation is the question of how
much emphasis should be put upon
participation sports and how much upon
spectator sports—for instance, whether
to put the resources of the community
into a big stadium for a major foot-
ball team that will be the focus of civic
feeling all fall, or rather to invest in a

skating rink or pathways for nature
walks or golf links.

Similarly a community must decide
whether to divide into natural neigh-
borhoods, with an attempt to provide
adequate recreation within close radius
of the houses, or whether, on the other
hand, to spend large sums of money on
larger but more remote city-wide rec-
reation facilities. In New York City
there is a proposed program to have
playgrounds on virtually every block
(one extreme) and the wonderful de-
velopment of Jones Beach (the other
extreme).

You have probably heard about a
southern city where, in order to get ade-
quate school sites for the most crowded
central housing area, they decided to
buy land three or four miles away,
on the periphery beyond the municipal
boundary, and to provide bus service.
They will take city children from their
home neighborhoods to this remote
site for education. I am sure this plan
entails a far greater change in daily
life than pe0ple realized when they die-
cided to depend upon bus transporta-
tion rather than upon bicycles and
walking.

Another major municipal policy deci-
sion involves the relation of park ad-
ministration, recreation administration,
and the school system. As you well
know, all three are parts _of recreation.
but in many places they pull in three
directions. It should be a matter of
public policy, adopted and set forth
clearly in writing after discussion, that
these three recreational operations are
to be coordinated.

Finally, what quality of recreation is
desired—highly organized games (base-
ball, soccer, and the like) or more in-
formal types of recreation (picnic
grounds, volley ball, hiking, boating) ?

These examples illustrate the kind of
policy decision that necessarily must
come before a decision as to just which
facilities to build and where to build

RECREATION

them. Often, however, policy is set with-
out very much forethought. Communi-
ties, in fact, sometimes are not conscious
of the fact that they are making policy
decisions. As an example, I mentioned
earlier the possible alternative, to con-
centrate development in some neighbor-
hoods of an open sort of town so as to
have other large countrylike areas un-
developed. Recently I had occasion to
discuss this pattern with oflicials of a
town where the zoning was arranged in
this fashion. But when I asked what
the policy was, the oflicials declared
that they weren’t aware of having any
in particular. Yet they actually had
adopted a major policy affecting the
whole future structure of the com-
munity. It“ is likely that the factory,
described earlier, was similarly ac-
cepted in the rural area with very little
critical study.

Lieutenant Governor Frank Moore of
New York, a luncheon speaker at the
Eighth Regional Conference of the
Regional Plan Association, remarked
that the thing he was proudest of in
seventeen years of experience in state
government was his success in enlist-
ing citizen committees to settle key
problems of state government that the
legislature had not been able to solve.
He recalled more than two hundred
committees that he had called into
being.

He was particularly proud of the fact
that in all seventeen years, in all several
hundred examples, on only one occasion
had a legislature failed to pass legisla-
tion recommended by these committees.
That is a most remarkable record. You
will be curious as to the one exception:
it was a recommendation for the city of
New York to have a transit authority.

Made ten years ago, it was adopted only
this year.

It would of course be carrying coals
to Newcastle for a regional planner to
aim at explaining to you the recreational
details introduced in my talk. Neither
Hugh Pomeroy who preceded me, John
Howard who now will follow, nor I,
pretend to instruct you in the matter
in which you are expert. I do hope,
however, that I will have reinforced at
least one thought. It is the conviction
that the planning way of conducting
public business is the democratic way;
that administrators of public programs,
including recreation programs, have a
solemn duty to bring broad policy ques-
tions into the open for public discussion
and majority determination; that the
surest path to adequate community fa-
cilities leads through the people.

Preparing for turtle race for lots.

0N what once was nothing but marshland and submarginal
ground there has arisen in southeastern Michigan a rec-

reation oasis that rapidly is becoming one of the greatest
and most beautiful summer-winter outdoor areas in the
state.

The site is the St. Clair Metropolitan Beach, located on
Lake St. Clair, fifteen miles northeast of the Detroit city
limits. Although known as a beach, the word in some sense
is a misnomer as the place is open the year around and
caters to almost as many ice fishermen, skaters and winter

sports enthusiasts as it does to summertime bathers.
The beach is a unit of the Huron-Clinton Metropolitan

Authority which was established in 1940 by referendum for
the preservation and deve10pment of the scenic beauty and
recreational Opportunities inherent in the valleys of ‘the

Huron and Clinton Rivers.
The Authority embraces five counties whose population

totals over three million people. The counties are Wayne,
Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw and Livingston. It is financed
by local taxes of a quarter-mill per year on the total assessed
valuation of each of the counties.

Since the Authority came into being, more than five mil-
lion dollars has been expended in the deve10pment of the
beach and parkway. Approximately the same amount has
been spent in developing other phases of the five-county
project, with its landscaped serpentine highways and access
roads. The state of Michigan has made grants totalling one
million dollars for land acquisition.

The beach is one of the largest developed fresh water
facilities of its kind in the United States. Crescent-shaped.
with clean, soft sand extending an average of three hundred
feet back from the water’s edge and six thousand feet in
length, it is considered one of the most beautiful beaches
in the country. The buildings are ultra-modern in architec-
tural style, and combine striking beauty of line with func-
tional design.

View from the dining terrace. The beach, which is crescent-shaped, has sand extending 300 feet back from the. water.

A bathhouse with six thousand lockers and almost two
hundred private dressing rooms provides the latest word in
convenience and efficiency to its patrons. An unusual feature
is a room equipped with bottles and food warmers and
other furnishings for the convenience of mothers with
infants.

A surfaced parking area can accommodate six thousand
cars. There are two beach sh0ps where umbrellas and chairs
may be rented, souvenirs and other beach accessories pur-
chased. A food bar can serve upwards of ten thousand
persons a day.

Adjacent to the food bar is a broad terrace with tables
shaded by coldrful umbrellas where patrons may enjoy
eating out-of-doors and have an excellent view of the lake
and beach activities. An adjoining building near the terrace
includes first-aid rooms, rest room facilities, and special
toilets for children using the grassy play area beyond.

Administration offices, employees’ locker and shower
rooms, information desk and reception room are located in
the main building across the mall from the bathhouse group.
The simple, clean-lined architecture of the beach buildings
is appropriate to the setting. The landscaping is of a casual
nature and conforms to the whole. Birch trees have been
planted to good advantage, and boxes with plants along. the
terrace and elsewhere are kept filled with seasonal flowers.

A playground designed solely for the kindergarten or
pre-school child is a special feature. A curvilinear concrete
walk, three feet wide and sixty feet long, permits tots to ride
tricycles to their hearts’ content. The tricycles are provided
by the beach, along with other specially constructed equip-
ment such as small tables, bucking swings, tippy canoes, see-
saws, climbing ladders, alphabetical wooden blocks, and
other pieces all in miniature.

During the winter season the beach maintains a rink off
the lake that can accommodate one thousand skaters at
one time. Heated shelters and rest rooms, music and flood-

MARCH 1954

lighting are provided for the skaters who are not required to
remove their skates as they move from building to building,
thanks to duckboards and special matting.

Fishermen find the lake, two lagoons and a small connect-
ing river ideal for their sport when ice forms over these
waters. Perch, pickerel and muskellunge are the main
catches, with perch hauls predominating. The Authority
has erected a $10,000 bait and tackle shop equipped with the
latest fishing gear and stocked continually with minnows.

In January of 1953 the Huron-Clinton Authority staged
its first annual Ice Fishing Derby in cooperation with a
metropolitan Detroit newspaper (the Detroit News). Over
eighteen hundred contestants ranged in age from seven to
seventy. Another six thousand persons came to watch the
fishermen vie for tr0phies.

St. Clair Metropolitan Beach was first opened to the
public in 1950, in the middle of August. It was in trial
operation for only a month at that time. The official opening
came in June of 1951, a year which saw, 383,432 persons
visiting the area. In 1952, deSpite a serious polio outbreak
that nearly reached epidemic proportions in August and

September, the beach attracted 472,640 from May 30
through September 1.

With the lifting of certain restrictions by the National
Production Authority, the Huron-Clinton Authority is mov-
ing ahead with plans for further development in land and -
buildings, which will be constructed as rapidly as finances
and time permit.

While used extensively by residents of southeastern
Michigan and other parts of the state, the beach is proving
a great mecca for tourists from all sections of the nation.
Located four miles northeast of Mount Clemens, itself a
noted spa where thousands come each summer for mineral

baths, it eventually will be to the Midwest what Jones Beach
is to New York and the East.

A TREMENDOUS popular demand for economy is being
felt on all levels of government. Locally, the pressure
is on; therefore, the use of fees and charges is very im-
portant, and we must know the answers. We must be able to
use this source of revenue more effectively.

It is important that each of us has a justifiable position
on the necessity and the reasonableness of the charges that
we made for our activities and for the use of facilities.

Why should people have to pay fees and charges?

There are three good reasons in each instance where a
fee is charged. (1) A fee is an additional means of revenue
to permit this activity to be offered. (2) When a fee is
charged, regardless of how small it may be, the people
using this activity generally place greater value on the
activity than if they were permitted to enjoy the activity
absolutely free. (3) A fee is charged on a type of activity
that relatively few would really wish to take advantage of.
A fee system tends to eliminate those who are not particu-
larly interested and often keeps out the troublemakers.

0n the other hand, of course, it may keep out a really
interested person who can’t afford to pay. This may be
true. No agency, however, can afford to give everybody
everything. It is a hard fact, but true and realistic.

A fee system is a sensible approach to the problem of
out-of-city users in a tax-supported program. Many pur-
posely live out of town to avoid taxes and still want to use
the things paid for by taxes. They should not be denied use;

SERVICE FEES
and CHARGES

William Miller

Presented at conference of the Wisconsin Park
and Recreation Society, Milwaukee, March, 1953.

but they should be willing to pay their fair share. A
reasonable fee is the answer.
Are fees and charges double taxation?

In a way, yes; but such “double taxation” can be justi-
fiable. The general public may be willing to foot the bill for
some activities, but there is a limit. Special activities, which
serve a limited few, should pay part or all of their own way.
What should service charges pay for? \

Administrative costs covering the organization of an
activity, its publicity and any expenses relative to setting
up the program should not be charged against any program.
Administrative costs are to be financed entirely by tax funds.

Specific costs that should be paid are those for the
instructor or the supervisor, supplies or materials used and,
in some instances, rent, if the activity requires a rented
facility. = '—

W ho should pay?

Team sponsorships are actually fees and charges—:the

-levying of individual fees upon one party. Usually the spon-

sor provides not only the fee but much of the equipment
used. Considering this, such sponsorship is of tremendous
financial importance to the entire program and requires the
same reasonable approach as any charge.

011 an individual basis, anyone enrolling in a specialized
activity, that is, an activity that by its very nature has
appealed to a limited few or that cannot be offered to every-
one, should pay a fee. This rule must be modified for
activities on a high school and younger level, perhaps
charging them only for the actual materials used (primarily
in the art and handcraft type of program). On an adult level,
these special activities often require the services of a spe-
cialized instructor who demands high wages; often expen-

RECREATION

sive materials and supplies are used; and in many instances
the activity must be held in a location which is outside the
facilities of the department. The pe0ple desiring this activity
should be willing to pay a reasonable rate for this oppor—
tunity.

How much should users of the activity pay?

In a way, this figure can only be arrived at by determin-
ing how much the users of an activity feel the program is
worth. Each locality must arrive at its own cost figures; and
clcar thinking, experiment and the courage to change, if
necessary, are required. There are several guides that will
help.

1. What type of peOple are interested in this program?
(Roughly, what is their social and economic position?)

2. How does the program compare with similar programs
run privately or commercially in the community?

3. What do neighboring cities of similar size charge?

4. What are the actual program costs per user?

Many attempt to justify a fee for a new activity by point-
ing out that the budget wouldn’t permit having the activity
otherwise. It is an injustice to charge a fee for an activity
just because it’s a new activity, and to offer the old activity
without fee simply because it’s always been done that way.
The entire program must be examined continually to deter-
mine what activities should be subsidized by the tax fund and
what fee, if any, must be charged the user to complete the

M

financing of the activity.

It is essential to offer some activities on all age levels with-
out charge to individuals. As a public tax-supported agency,
a recreation department has the responsibility to provide
recrcation for everyone and in many instances without addi-
tional charge. But there are some activities that are limited
in appeal that should not be totally financed by the depart-
ment. As to the value of a particular program, here are a
few guides:

1. The number of active participants.

2. The number of spectators.

3. The cost of the program per participant.

4. The activity’s value to the community and to the user.
5. Its probable future importance; that is, is it a growing
activity in the hard formative years? If so, try to aid it until
it can take a greater financial load.

The problem of fees and charges is not a simple one, but
it is a problem that requires a reasonable and justifiable
stand by each of us. The real difficulty has been the failure
to recognize that it is just as foolish to charge “any old fee”
as it is to charge nothing. Basically, this problem requires
that we evaluate our programs and classify each and every
one as to its value to the entire recreation picture. It then
requires that we determine each program’s cost and decide
what programs are to be offered free, what programs are
to be offered with a charge and what that charge should be.

 

Day Camping Facilities and Program

Eva Hahn, of the Welfare Council, Toronto, writes in the Community Courier:

VARIETY OF PATTERNS has emerged both in administra-
A tion and in programming, a healthy sign. Thc basic pat-
tern, however, is so simple that any community or commu-
nity group that wishes to do so may establish a summer pro-
gram for young children with a minimum of effort and ex-
pense. Here is a list of the desirable facilities:

I. A wooded area, park or campsite with sufiicient space for hiking,
group games, fire building and eating.

2. A structure which provides shelter for the children in case of
rainy weather as well as storage space for the equipment and supplies.
3. Lavatories should be sufhcient to accommodate the number of
children involved and should be maintained at a sound standard of
sanitation.

4. Drinking fountains or the availability of pure drinking water can-
not be overemphasized. Activities cannot be enjoyed by children who
do not have suiiicient liquids to maintain health and satisfaction in
warm weathcr.

5. A swimming or wading area is desirable but is not always possible.
However, the choice of a site need not be limited by the availability
of1a|beach, because swimming can usually be arranged at a local pool
of: beach. Even a creek or tiny river for wading, fishing and all the

other water activities that stem from young imagination, is a great
advantage.

Next to the facilities, the planning of the program is most
important. ln order to take advantage of the sunshine and
natural surroundings and to provide the youngsters with a
rich and vital experience, the prime focus of any day camp
program should be outdoor activities such as hiking, fire-
building, camp cookery, nature lore, campcraft, group
games, singing, and council rings. A true day camp pro-
gram is not an extension of the year-round program trans-
ferred from a gym or club-room to a park.

I. .. “tie.

A popular technique now being used in day camps is
called “theme programming.” This means the selection of
an attractive theme around which most of the camp activities
are planned. For example, life in an Indian village or on a
western ranch suggests many interesting games and crafts.
A modification of the method has been used successfully
where the emphasis is on giving children experience in
group planning and decision-making. This application of
the method is called “the project method.”

The development of a “project” may be illustrated by a
group of ten- to eleven-year-old girls who decided, under the
guidance of a counselor, that for the duration of a hike they
would be naturalists studying the camp area. The girls kept
their eyes peeled for as many kinds of plants as could be
found. The counselor suggested that they prepare a display
{hr the rest of the camp and the result was the development

{of a terrarium which grew into a project of considerable

ni'agnitude and involved the energy and creativity of the
entire group before it was completed. As a further result of

this experience the group built an aquarium.

.Q'This kind of activity naturally adds to the camp experi-
ence at the children’s own level and stimulates the individ-
u_al’s interests without minimizing group effort. The chil-
:dren’s interest is high, disciplinary problems are reduced
and new skills are developed. Themes and projects can be
used in many ways and for long or short periods.

IG CREEK, California, located sixty-two miles east of
Fresno, nestles within some of the ruggedest and wildest
mountains of California. On top of two thousand feet of
sheer rock, directly above the community, stretches a canyon
plateau on which lies Huntington Lake with its heavy timber
of pine, cedar, and fir. This is the gateway to the back-
country, and the High Sierras. It is a wilderness playground,

and one of the finest recreation areas in the state. The
campsites are good, the trout plump, deer plentiful, and
the scenery is as beautiful as you will find anywhere. The
community, however, is rather isolated from any large
center of population, and, as a result, whaotever entertain-
ment and recreation is to be had must be furnished locally.
It is little wonder therefore, that the local school board
realized the importance of providing a sound year—round
recreation program for the approximately seven hundred
and fifty people of the community, and took the necessary
steps to establish such a service. Big Creek is an unusual
example indicating how an elementary school district can
provide a recreation program for all of the members of
its community through a well-balanced program of many
kinds of activities, both indoor and outdoor.

Many schools already provide instruction in most of the
activities which make up a well-rounded program of leisure
education: physical education, music, arts and crafts,
literature, clubs, forums, dramatics, group work, and others.
Then it is only natural that they become the principal com-
munity agency for the organization and development of all
of the community’s resources that serve youth and adult
needs. The Big Creek School Board believes that there is

a close correlation between recreation and education, and

considers recreational activities as one of the most im-
portant educational mediums for the enrichment of the
social, mental, and physical development of the people of
this community. As a result, the board, by its own resolu-
tion of October 1950, accepted the responsibility of estab-
lishing a department of recreation and has provided a
competent staff, permitted the use of school buildings and
facilities, and furnished the equipment and financial support.
to insure a well-rounded, year-round recreation program.

Several other California school-community recreation
programs are administered by school districts alone; but
perhaps none equal the budget, facilities, equipment and
leadership per capita of that of the Big Creek School District.
This elementary school district is the only governing body
in the whole mountain area, and exemplifies, at its best,
cooperation between school and community.

The Big Creek School Board has delegated the respon-
sibility of administering the recreation program to the
director of physical education and recreation. He in turn

rincipal. The director of physical education and recreation
5 employed by the school board and must possess a valid
Ialifornia physical education credential.

Funds from the school district make up the recreation
udget, and all policies governing the use of facilities and
quipment stem from the school board. In addition the board
:as given approval to the establishment of 3 Recreation
:ouncil, which serves in an advisory capacity and assists
he director with the administration of the recreation pro-
ram.

The schedule of recreational activities is based upon the
ceds and interests of the people of the community, as well
s the facilities and resources that are available. It is hoped
hat the list of activities will grow as new interests are
roused and new facilities are developed.

During the summer months, emphasis is placed upon
DUI'Of'dOOI' activities such as swimming, hiking, fishing,
nd camping. For four weeks each summer, American Red
iross swimming instruction is provided for the people of
he community at the swimming area at Shaver Lake, which
3 ten miles west of Big Creek. A regularly scheduled school
ius transports the children and parents from Big Creek to
ihaver Lake for their swimming classes and return. In addi-
ion, the department provides three qualified Red Cross
wimming'instructors and one supervisor to administer
he program. The classes run one hour in length, four classes
uer day, five days per week for two two-week periods. The
ecreation department furnishes this service free of charge,

.nd no fee is collected for either class instruction or
ransportation.

The children are allowed to remain at our swimming
.rea for the entire afternoon. We have a swimming super-
isor in charge of our free swimming area, which is separate
rom the area used for our regularly scheduled classes. The
:hildren and adults may swim at any time in this free
wimming area which has a certified Red Cross lifeguard
upervising it. The children may or may not remain at the
wimming area after their classes, according to their parent’s
vishes. Those who remain must return on the last bus.
Ilimax of the swimming program is the Swim Carnival
leld on the last day of the period.

When the swimming program is not in session, the chil-
Iren are arranged into three different grade groups for hik-
ng. These various groups are scheduled for one outing per
veek. In addition, the older boys in the community are taken
)n packtrips into the High Sierras, where they can have
he opportunity of camping, hiking, climbing, exploring,
Jhotography, and fishing for the golden trout at an eleva-
ion of over 10,000 feet. Here the country is rugged and
agged, and many find it overpowering. However, as one
ravels into the back-country, dozens of lakes will be passed

alus slopes—all of which add to the experiences of those

vho have the opportunity of visiting this great out-of—door
ilayground.

In addition to taking advantage of the natural resources
that are at the community’s door, school facilities are utilizcd
for the summer recreation program. The gymnasium is kept
open from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M. and from 7 P.M. to 11 P.M. for
organized games and bowling. Children are allowed to bowl
free in the afternoons, if they set their own pins. On Friday
evenings, the regular weekly movie is shown, which is free
to the public. Since there is not another theatre within fifty
miles of this community, the people look forward each
week to seeing these movies that the department obtains
from Hollywood. In addition, a weekly softball league is
provided for the men, and one for the children.

The indoor program is centered in the very fine new rec-
reation building costing approximately $350,000. The build-
ing is used as a combination gymnasium and auditorium,
and includes a regulation basketball floor (or floorspace for
two Volleyball courts or three badminton courts), a combi-

nation handball and squash court which can be used as a
utility room for boxing and wrestling, two bowling alleys,
locker and shower rooms, rest rooms, two equipment rooms,
movie projector room, music room, cafeteria and kitchcn,
wood shop (equipped with all power tools, where the people
can purchase hard or soft wood at cost, and have an instruc-
tor provided to assist them with their projects) , and the di-
rector’s office. In addition, the school has set aside in their
new school building an arts and crafts room. This is
equipped for class instruction in leathercraft, silvercraft,
and ceramics. There is a new kiln installed for the making
of pottery. Other facilities which are available are: a turf
playground equipped with playground equipment, a lighted
softball field, a lighted tennis court, rifle range, swimming
area and beach, and natural resources such as the moun-
tains, streams, lakes, and woods.

Any consideration of the Big Creek school community
recreation program would be incomplete without attention
being given to the method by which it is financed. The en-

163

tire educational program at Big Creek is supported through
public taxation of the property within the school district,
which is one of the richest elementary school districts in
California. The tax levy of seventy-six cents per one hundred

dollars assessed valuation is unusually low for California
school districts. Approximately fourteen cents of this levy
is budgeted for the support of the recreation program.

Big Creek Elementary School District is one of the richest,
if not the richest, school district in the state, because it is
supported by Edison Company of Southern California,
which owns most of the property in this area and has an
assessed valuation of over $45,000,000.

The department of physical education and recreation pre~
pares the budget covering the items of expenditure for that
department of the entire school system. It is then reviewed
by the recreation council, and later by the school principal,
before it is presented to the school board for approval. The
1953-54 Big Creek recreation budget includes $17,250 for
salaries and wages, $24,390 for expenses, equipment and
supplies, $18,000 for capital expenditures, for a total of
$59,640. '

This brave program in one of America’s mountain villages
is an excellent example of the leadership and facilities which
education can and should provide where other governing
agencies are either lacking or uninterested. The Big Creek
School Board should be congratulated upon assuming the
responsibility of providing a year-round recreation pro~
gram for the members of its community. Today, amidst the
unrest throughout the world, it is gratifying to know that
there are some school boards willing to accept the role of
serving as a community recreation agency, and willing to
provide their children and adults with a recreation program
which meets their needs and interests. '

Wilderness Expeditions

The Trail Riders of the Wilderness—an intrepid band of
men and women who have explored thousands of miles of
wilderness trails on their many expeditions—celebrated
their twentieth anniversary in 1953 with a bumper crop of
seventeen trips, which varied from ten to thirteen days in
length, the biggest itinerary in the Trail Rider history of
one hundred twenty-seven separate expeditions.

By horseback through the wilderness regions of national
forests in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico
and Washington, more than three hundred riders took the
trail on trips through roadless country where the grandeur
of bold mountains vies with the beauty of alpine flora and
sparkling lakes. They swam and fished in little known lakes
and streams which flow through dramatic country, and
camped in alpine meadows where towering, majestic moun-
tains formed spectacular backgrounds. Two parties of Trail
Riders took to canoes and paddled their way through the
chain of lakes in the Quetico-Superior Wilderness of the
Superior National Forest in Minnesota, a primitive region
first entered by Trail Riders in 1941. (See “Let’s Take a
Canoe Trip” by Sigurd F. Olson, which appeared in the

164

February issue of RECREATION on page 76, for information
on a canoe trip through this region.)

Organized by and Operating under the direction of The
American Forestry Association, Washingon, D. C., Trail
Riders of the Wilderness have become a real factor in provid-
ing greater recreational opportunities to Americans. As a
group they represent a means by which any man or woman,
in a normal state of health and with an average amount
of outdoor experience, may fully enjoy true wilderness
country under experienced and organized leadership. The
Association Operates the expeditions on a non-profit basis
as part of its educational services, the riders sharing equally
in the costs. The horseback trips are limited to from twenty~
two to thirty riders; the canoe trips to fifteen. A representa-
tive of the Association and a physician accompany each
party. Cooperating with the American Forestry Association
in organizing and directing the Trail Rider expeditions are
the United States Forest Service and the National Park
Service, the two government agencies responsible for the
administration and protection of the larger remnants of
the primitive areas.

Unit Costs for Services

The annual financial report of the
Los Angeles Department of Recreation
and Parks for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1953, contains a fund of valu;
able information with reference to ex-
penditures, income and costs of various
services rendered by the department.
Some of the figures relating to unit
costs of services are of special interest.

The average cost of playground oper-
ation per unit of attendance is recorded
for each area. Unit cost varies from
thirteen cents in one district to twenty-
two cents in another. The average for
the seven districts of the city is approxi-
mater seventeen cents per attendance
unit.

Camper days in the city’s camp total-
ed 84,200 and the average net daily cost
per camper was $1.03. At the High
Sierra Camp, the department realized a
profit of nearly twenty-eight cents per
day per camper, whereas at the H01-
lywoodland Camp the net camper cost
was $2.76.

At the city’s swimming pools, where
a total attendance of 1,000,292 was re-
corded, the average net cost per swim
was nearly thirteen cents. The ratio be-
tween income and expense varied wide-
ly: one pool yielded a profit of two
cents per swim, whereas at the Los An-
geles Swimming Stadium the net cost
was fifty-eight cents per swim. (Many
of the pool attendances are free.)

The city’s beaches attracted 11,457,-
334, with an average individual net cost
of nearly three and a half cents.

The city’s three golf courses, used by
608,197, showed an average net profit
of nearly twenty-six cents per person.
The average cost per visitor at the
Cahrillo Marine Museum was slightly
more than five cents.

TVA Leases Park Lands
The Tennessee Valley Authority has

dering its reservoirs to counties and
municipalities for park use and develop-
ment. Public investment in the improve-
ment of thirty-three local parks, includ-
ing improvements by concessionaires,
averaged $336 per acre, it was disclosed
in a study conducted by the TVA. In
the opinion of the TVA the response of
local agencies in the use and develOp-
ment of park areas for which they as-

sumed responsibility has proved highly
satisfactory except for a few cases. The
TVA indicated that, on the basis of any
comparison which might be made, these
parks were serving the purposes for
which they were leased and were meet-
ing with as great a public response as
could have been expected.

Alabama Attorney General’s

Ruling

Thomas A. Belser, superintendent of
parks and recreation in Montgomery,
Alabama, reports an opinion handed
down by the state attorney general. In
Alabama the attorney general’s ruling
has the effect of law until the case is
duly disposed of by further legal pro-
cedure. '

In Citronelle, Alabama, the Kiwanis
Club prOposed to lease from the town a
plot of ground currently used as a ball
*park for the school and town, and to
install a lighted field and swimming
pool for the benefit of the public. The
club proposed to charge for the use of
the facilities a suflicient amount to
maintain them.

The club asked the town to appr0pri-
ate $10,000 for the proposed improve-
ments which were to cost $25,000. The
question arose as to whether the town
could legally appr0priate or contribute
from its treasury this, or any other
amount, for this purpose.

It was understood that a corporation
was to be formed with a board of direct-
ors, one member of which would be se-
lected from the town council and an-
other from the c6unty school board,
since part of the land used would be
school property. The facilities would
not be operated for profit, but for the
general benefit of the public. In re-
questing the opinion, the mayor and
council expressed the belief that the pro-
posed undertaking would be beneficial
to the community.

The attorney general’s answer to the
inquiry, expressed in a letter to the
mayor of Citronelle, who had requested
an official opinion, was in the negative.
He added: “Your attention is directed
to Constitution of Alabama 1901, Sec-
tion 94, which reads as follows:

The legislature shall not have power to
authorize any county, city, town, or other
subdivision of this state to lend its credit,
or to grant public money or thing of value
in aid of, or to any individual association,
or corporation, whatsoever, or to become a
stockholder in any such corporation, asso-

ciation, or company, by issuing bonds or
otherwise.

“The Constitution and By-Laws of
the Memorial Park Association, Incor-
porated, Citronelle, Alabama, accom-
panying your request, plainly show that
it is a private association or corporation
and comes within the inhibition of Sec-
tion 94, supra.”

The attorney general recognized that
the public would be benefited by the
establishment of the center, but cited a
number of decisions which supported
his answer. He concluded:

“I am of the opinion, therefore, that
the city council of Citronelle is not au-
thorized to appr0priate money for the
erection of a recreational center to be
under the management and control and
erected by Memorial Park Association,
Incorporated. To make such an appro-
priation would obviously violate Con-
stitution of Alabama 1901, Section 94.

“In this regard your attention is di-
rected to the provisions of . . . which
provides that the city itself may appro-
priate its funds to a recreational board
created by the city.

“The incorporation of the Memorial
Park Association, Incorporated, was not
under the provisions of . . . Therefore
I pretermit an expression of Opinion as
to the right of the city to appr0priate

money to a corporation predicated on
this Act.”

Day Campers

Go a’Vagab onding

Dorothy Lou MacMillan

“There’s magic in my tiny craft when
I put out to sea.” This quote from the
poem “Sea Magic” by Muriel W. Edger-
ton, in RECREATION magazine several
years ago, might well have been the
thought in the mind of each young sailor who set sail on
the “City of Portland” that summer for Elk Rock Island
Day Camp. The pretentious name, “City of Portland,” be-
longed to a twenty-eight-foot navy lifeboat with a small
locker in the bow, a gas motor, and a stern tiller. The mast
flag boasted “Portland Park Bureau” in the cherished red
and white colors carried out in the painting of the boat
itself. The young sailors were boys and girls seven to twelve
years of age who daily “checked on” for an hour’s ride up
the Willamette to Elk Rock Island where they spent the
greater portion of the day in various day camp activities,
returning home late in the afternoon.

Portland, Oregon, is very fortunate in possessing a river,

section. Half the pOpulation travels daily over the bridges

connecting the east and west sides. They are held up fre-
quently by boats carrying logs, lumber and produce; and it
was during one of these waits that someone had an idea.
Wouldn’t it be thrilling for the boys and girls of Portland to
see first-hand the 10g rafts, the river tugs, the aircraft carriers
being demolished, the visiting English destroyers, the old
stern-wheelers, the colorful houseboats, the sand and gravel
dredges, and the lumber industry of the Willamette River?
To complete the picture, the city owned an island south of
the city limits which offered possibilities for picnics, over-
night camping, Indian lore and interesting adventures.

The idea was nurtured and grew strong-fed by public-
spirited friends of the Portland Bureau of Parks. A twenty-
eight foot navy whale boat, or lifeboat, was purchased from
the War Assets Administration, its motor overhauled, ade-
quate life jackets and life preservers supplied, the craft
painted—and the “City of Portland” was officially launched
with becoming ceremony.

The recreation department of the bureau of parks was

given the job of manning the boat and supplying neces-
sary programming and children for the venture. Miss
Dorothea Lensch, director of recreation, immediately saw
the value of the “City of Portland.” Here was a medium
through which a day camp could be offered on Elk Rock
Island. I was asked to direct this enterprise; and together
we worked out a program embracing vagabond day trips
during June and August, and day camping on a weekly
basis during July.

The boat had a capacity for forty adults so it was decided
that thirty to thirty-five children plus three adults and equip-
ment would be the top number. As the craft was to carry
passengers, it was necessary to have a licensed pilot. Paul
J aeger, one of the swimming pool lifeguards, who had been
in the navy, was asked to carry this responsibility. Because
two hours or more of each day would be spent on the river,
all members of the staff had to be excellent swimmers.

Unfortunately, the river water was contaminated and it
was necessary to make a rule stating no swimming at the
island. This situation also necessitated daily transportation
of fifteen to thirty gallons of water in sterile cans. Also,
because the island was often visited by outsiders in the
evening and on weekends, all the equipment used in the
camping program had to be transported daily on the boat.
There was ample room in the locker for this and overflow
could be stored under the seats.

This was a new camping venture in Portland and, in order
to introduce the idea, a program of daily vagabond trips was
set up whereby any interested child might register through
his nearest playground or community center. Newspaper
stories and material distributed in schools and recreation
centers helped publicize the event.

Each playground was assigned a special day for the trip.
Activities included exploring, fishing, observing water life,
hiking, woodcraft, and campcraft. The children were charged
twenty cents to defray running expenses, with trips scheduled
through June and the day camp to be set up in July. The
plan was to have a one-week session, Monday through
Friday, for girls seven, eight and nine years of age; a one-
week session for boys of the same age; a one-week session
for girls ten, eleven and twelve years of age; and a one-week
session for boys of the same age. A theme was chosen for

II»

each session in order to have a central idea around which
to plan special activities, meals and the campfire program.

While these plans were being formed, the construction
gang was busy building a permanent rustic shelter, two
toilets and a movable dock in the cove on one side of the
island. A special crew helped eradicate the poison oak which
for years had grown rampant over the island.

Unfortunately, a river Hood in May delayed the start of
our program until July. The period of orientation with
vagabond trips and the first week of the day camp were
already lost; we decided to dispense with the trips and to
start the first period of camp one week late. Our first day,
a beautiful sunny July 12, arrived—so did twenty—five little
“gypsies” clamoring to board the boat. Enthusiasm was
great. Boat rules—no heads, hands, or feet outside the boat;
no standing up except in the bottom of the boat (which was
four feet deep) ; no changing of seats without permission; a
life jacket must be worn at all times—Aware very well ob-
served throughout the remainder of the summer.

50 the dream was being realized! There were all the things
that the dreamer had hoped would be seen—plus other
islands, handsome cruisers, surf board riders, speed boats,

beautiful homes, an apparently honest—to-goodness half—

again before they arrived, but it was comforting to know that
they were handy.

For the program of day camp activities, youngsters were
divided into three groups, each with an adult leader. They
held meetings in secret hiding places on the island, carried
out “secret missions,” cooked outdoors, explored, played
on rafts they built themselves, looked for polliwogs, min-
nows, and baby catfish, fished and “just played.” Campcraft
activities, which were a part of the secret missions, included
instruction in the proper use and care of camp tools '
and the building of such camp necessities as garbage
burners, various types of fires, bean holes, dishwater and
hand water drains, lashing projects, and erecting various
types of tent shelters. Camp jobs of wood gathering, sani-
tation of toilets, and care of general equipment were rotated
each day. Outdoor cooking progressed from toasting sand-
wiches, roasting corn, baking potatoes, preparing and cook-
ing one-pot meals such as stew and spaghetti, frying hot
cakes and eggs, to baking beans in a bean hole.

Whenever the staff knew that logging trains were rolling
logs into the river to be made into rafts, they took the chil-
dren a mile up the river to the scene of operations. How the
logs rolled off the flat cars, turned end down, dived! into the
water to send a splash twenty-five feet high never ‘failed to
amaze the boys and girls. Every child also had an oppor-
tunity to hold the tiller,and guide the “City of Portland.”
In the afternoon, there: was always time to climb over the
rocks to look for hiding places, to see the huge Elk Rock
where the Indians drove the elk over the cliff to the water
below where they were caught and killed for food, to dig
for buried treasures, or to hunt crawfish, minnows or baby
catfish. 0n the overnights, children learned to look for soft
places to sleep and to make Eskimo-style beds. Many of
them experienced the evening campfire and sleeping under
the stars for the first time, with the breeze and the lap of the
water gently lulling them to sleep.

During the last three weeks in August, vagabond trips
were held daily, with a different group of children each day.

From the experience of that summer, the staff came to
the conclusion that an island day camp can be Very prohtable
to a child, and, although the attendance wasn’t as large as
had originally been anticipated, the interest shown war-

ranted further development of this program. It was sug-

gested that the island be made a center for water activities
with boats, rafts, fishing and the like, as a great part of
the program. Future plans include “Hatty” rowboats large
enough for two children, more rafts, and more hshing
equipment. The island itself, will be kept primitive with
its tangle of underbrush in the Woods, the rocky eagle’s nest,
buried treasure, the gold cave and the wrecked ship. The
staff wants to help children remember the fast-disappearing
stern-wheeler chugging down the river at dusk, the “.Peter
W”——-the largest tug on the river—and, most of all, they want
boys and girls to hold in their hearts the memory of sitting
under whispering fir trees with a soft breeze fanning the
glowing embers of a campfire, the warmth of friendship
radiating about each member of the group, the feeling of
belonging to the great out-of-doors.

gLMOST any camp for boys or girls
is located in the midst of compara-

tively unspoiled nature. The fitness of
this has been recognized in the selection
of the site so that the inquisitive and
receptive mind of youth can have free
rein. Nature lore can be learned almost
unconsciously. However, in far too few
camps'is there anyone prepared to focus
interest constructively and to take time
to be attentive to all there is to ask or
tell or show. There is leadership for
sports, dramatics perhaps, and for other
interests, but none for the activity which
so peculiarly belongs to this summer
retreat. If trained personnel are not
availahle, why cannot something be at-
tempted by an amateur interested
enough to explore and learn with the
campers?

Encouragement of inquiry and ob-
servation is the immediate thing. Some
staggering questions will be asked and
may not always be fully or scientifically
answered. As boys and leaders work
along together information becomes

less faulty and fragmentary. This is as
it should be, for the guide who is too
sure of every fact is no guide at all.
Even young learners quickly detect
any sham.

In my experience it has been good,
regardless of what formal instruction
may be expected of me, to capitalize
first on the collecting instinct so strong
in boys or so easily aroused if not yet
evident. Set up the nucleus of a museum
drawing on whatever may have accumu-
lated during one’s own collecting days,
give it the necessary space with plenty
of room for eXpansion and see how
promptly it will begin to fill up. The
excitement with which a ten-year-old
collector brings in a baby gar-pike, a
three-foot eel or a freshwater sponge
growing on a sunken stick, is something
to remember. When the geologist mem-
ber of the team discovers that dark
streaks on the shore are magnetite and
will react to his pocket magnet, he has
the boys agog and eager to learn to
distinguish the minerals in the local
rocks. At the close of camp, enthusiasts
will carry home samples for the purpose
of demonstrating magnetism to their
families and chums.

Living things, of course, have their
special tug at the heartstrings. Patient
groups will gather about a dragon-fly
nymph, resting on its support after its
journey out of the water, to watch the
emergence and the wing expansion of
the noble insect. The transformations
from caterpillars to monarch or mourn-
ing cloak hutterHy may be followed as
far as the two-week period in camp will
permit. Perhaps the change from tad-

    

pole to frog will be timed for the delight
of all. Life in an ant-hill or in a shallow
pool will hold the audience spellbound.
Birds and their nests are a universal at-
traction. One of the first duties of the
camp naturalist is to forestall, if pos-
sible, the arrival at the museum of some
elated urchin bearing tribute of hirds’
eggs or nests. The leader must early im-
press on all the idea that it isn’t done,
so that no crestfallen child will have
to be told that his trophy is not as
welcome as he had hoped. The campersa
enthusiasm can be made the basis of
lessons in conservation and the humane
treatment of animals.

The endless snake lore of boys, often
sadly misguided, all comes under re-
view. Their grass snakes prove to be
our garter snakes, the supposed slimi-
ness of snakes is found to be a myth.
Most fellows have to be convinced that
none of our species (except where
riattlesnakes survive) are venomous, al-
though it is not to be denied that some
could leave a wound from their strike
if molested and even possibly a slight
infection from their jaws. The bene-
ficial role of snakes as devourers of
pests will be appreciated and then quali-
fied when one is seen to swallow a live
frog, also man’s friend.

Lessons like these are bound to be
well learned. Children have the sharp
eyes of born investigators. They will
find the often elusive milkweed cater-
pillar and if there is not time for them
to see the gem-like chrysalis and the
emerged monarch butterfly a few weeks
later, they can be shown pictures of
these stages. Whatever the prize may he,

the fantastic walking-stick, the praying

they can count on their leader’s appre-
ciation of their prowess. '-

In almost every camp it is the younger
campers who make the most of the op-
portunity to study nature. For fellows
getting on into their teens, natural
history has increasingly to compete
with other interests such as sports,
dramatics, campcraft and all the extras
with which a program tends to become
crowded. For those who are interested,
encouragement in the form of nature

badges should be offered.

A competitive “nature hunt” for all
campers is usually found acceptable.
Each group leader is handed a copy of
a list of fifteen or twenty natural objects.
Thesc are to be hrought by his team to
a choscn rendezvous while he directs
operations. When a group believes it is
ready, its hoard is inspected, but if all
the items cannot be certified correct in
all respects, the hunt goes on until it or
another team can be declared thc
winner.

A camp museum can be located any-
where in camp, under canvas or indoors,
anywhere that visitors can congregate
without being in the way. It should have
accommodation for the display of speci-
mens on tables and shelves, with ample
space for moving around for inspection.
Work benches for the preparation of the
exhibits, for laboratory equipment and
for reading and writing are essential.
A small library of illustrated publica-
tions should be set up. The offerings
of various government departments

MARCH 1954
I

can be obtained at little or no cost.
These should cover rocks and minerals,
wildflowers and weeds, trees, insects,
birds and animals. Loose-leaf albums
of the nature snapshots of campers over
the years are popular. Copies or files of
nature periodicals, like Canadian Na.-
ture, are most valuable. Colored pic-
tures, maps and charts on the walls add
immensely to the museum’s atmosphere.

The equipment need not be elaborate
at first. Living material may be kept
in makeshift aquaria, cages or other
containers while habits, transforma-
tions and other peculiarities are under
observation. With some ingenuity,much
of this equipment may be made by the
boys in their handcraft periods. Speci-
mens of some size will simply lie loosely
on the tables, but small and delicate
exhibits are better supported in card-
board boxes with transparent covers.
Some objects need hut little preparation,
others present a real challenge to the
lad who wants to help to make approved
exhibits of them. If a collection of in-
sects is to be attempted, it is well to
have killing hottles, nets for catching,
mounting pins and cork-lined cases to
receive the specimens. For plants, a
press should be available. Lacking
means to keep fungi in natural condi-
tion, their various spore-prints can be
taken on cards and protected under a
cover of ce110phane. Animal specimens
present more problems but it may. be
possible to preserve some things in
alchohol or formalin in jars. The sting
of a bee, extracted from the victim, may
be placed under cellophane for all to
examine with a lens.

 

Among instruments needed, a strong
hand lens for the instructor and a few
of less expensive type for the use of

careful campers are first in importance.
Boys love to focus them on anything in
sight. A compound microsc0pe, while
most appealing and a distinct asset with
advanced nature students, is not a must
until the museum becomes more of an
institution. Good binoculars for bird
study are more or less essential. Any of
these accessories arouse so much rivalry
for their use that they are better re-
served for the individual or some small
group under supervision.

On every camp staff there should be
those adaptahle enough and humhlc
enough to get down to the child’s in-
quisitive level. The best leaders will be
those who can he deeply touched with
a reverent appreciation of the meaning
of life, its source and destiny and our
relation to it all. Nature lore thus can
be a close ally to camp worship. Camp-
ing thus becomes a constructive ex-
perience in the best sense in the lives
of the young. For any who are interest-
ed, but doubt their adequacy in natural
history subjects, let me repeat that much
is possihle without the,immediate adop-
tion of all that has been outlined in the
foregoing. We learn by doing. Where
there is a local field naturalists’ club,
join in its activities. 0n the other hand;
what better task can await the members
of such a club than the equipping of
such leaders and the undertaking of this
leadership themselves when this is pos-
sible? There are surely few more re-
warding ways of vacationing than that
offered in sharing with youth.

EVERY SPORT has its country of origin. When it wins its
p0pularity there, it begins to spread. throughout the
world. Thus golf is English, ice hockey Canadian, and base-
ball American. These sports are now well-known the world
over. But have you ever heard of “Orientation” as a sport,
or “Orienteering” as the American enthusiasts now call it?

WHAT IT IS. The Swedish sport of orienteering is an out-
door one. It is based on ability to use map and compass cor-
rectly under varying conditions, and for solving different
problems in unknown territory. There are recreational, in-
structional and competitive forms of the sport. The most
popular competitive form in Sweden is finding one’s way
over unfamiliar terrain through the use of map and compass,
in competition with others racing over the same course.

HISTORY. The history of eXploration and discovery is the
history of orienteering. The Chinese used compasses as far
back as A. D. 300, and in Europe the compass came into use
during the 12th century. In Sweden, orienteering began as
a sport in 1918, growing slowly until 1930, when special
equipment was introduced in the form of a newly invented
type of compass, combining protractor and compass, called
Silva—the Latin name for forest. The use of this compass
and other special equipment became known as the Silva
System of orientation. Today there are over 1,500 clubs,
representing 35,000 members, practising orienteering regu-
larly as a competitive sport. It is now sponsored by the
Swedish government, and is a compulsory school course.

METHOD .OF TRAVEL. Various methods of travel are used,
including walking, running, bicycles, canoes, boats, cars,
horses, and in winter, snowshoes or skis.

with permission from the September 1948 issue of the Com-
munity Courier, introduced orienteering in Canada in 1946.

THE SPORT 0

TYPES OF ORIENTEERING. Teamed up with a natural inter-
est in the country in which you live and nature lore, learning
the use of map and compass; and putting this knowledge to
practical use, presents many interesting and enjoyable forms
of orienteering. These range from simple Sunday afternoon
walks through the woods and fields, always knowing where
you are, to the overnight hunting or fishing trips planned
by the person who knows he can rely on his ability to inter-
pret a map and use it with a compass correctly.

The teaching of orienteering to give practice in map and
compass reading in an enjoyable way, without drudgery, is
itself recreation. Generally this takes the form of simple
exercises or competitions. The instructor may use his own
imagination, but there are several standard forms:

INDOOR FORMS:

Map Symbol Quiz. The competitors are examined as to their
knowledge of the different map symbols. Sketch a number
of map symbols on a blackboard or other suitable back-
ground—easy symbols for beginners, difiicult symbols for
advanced competitors. The task is to write down the mean-
ings of the symbols. The contest can also be reversed, so
that the competitors have to sketch map symbols specified
by the contest leader. A combination of these two arrange-
ments is also rccommended. The winner is the competitor
who has the highest total of correct answers.

Another type of symbol contest is the following: Select a
region on the map which contains many different map sym-
bols. Indicate the limits of the region to the competitors and
ask them to write down how many, and what symbols, are
to be found there. Every omitted or mistaken symbol is
penalized with an addition of one minute. The competitor
who has finished the contest in shortest time, including the
addition of mistakes, is the winner.

Compass Course Determination on the Map. Competitors
have to indicate the compass directions to a number of points
on the map. From a common initial point on the map the
competitors must take compass bearings for ten different
points. These should be of such nature that they are exact
points on the map—thus hills without specially prominent

DRIENTEERING

Bjorn Kjellstrom

 

“Orienteering” is a popular Swedish sport. With a map and
a compass, the eompetitors must find the shortest route
between two places. Here, at one of the relay points, the
iudzes wait, warming themselves with a eup of hot coffee.

tops, swamps which are not of pointed form, circular or oval
lakes, and so on, are not suitable. The winner will be the
competitor who takes all the bearings correctly in the
shortest time. For each degree that he has erred, however,

MARCH 1954

an addition of one minute should be added to his time. A
certain margin must, nevertheless, be allowed for the im-
perfection of the human eye. One or two degrees on either
side of the correct line is suitable for this purpose. If, for
example, the correct figure is seventy-six degrees, results
between seventy-four and seventy-eight degrees might be
considered correct: For groups more advanced in compass
reading, the tolerance of error can be reduced.

Other indoor forms include:

Cardinal Points Quiz. Starting from north, the competitors
have to indicate other points of the compass.

Indication of Control Stations. Guided by written specifica-
tions for a number of control stations, the competitors are
to mark their location on the map.

Calculating Distances on the Map. Equipped with a ruler
and a map, the competitors have to calculate the distances
between a number of points.

OUTDOOR FORMS:

Walking by Compass. The competitors are to follow a given
compass direction towards a collecting landmark. The direc-
tion given is to be kept as accurately as possible. The main
purpose of compass competitions is to give the participants
training in walking by compass. It may be arranged in vari-
ous ways. In a compass competition even beginners who are
entirely new to orienteering may be dispatched without risk
after receiving concise instructions.

The simplest form of compass competitions consists in
giving the competitors instructions at the start to follow a
certain compass direction through the forest with the great-
est possible accuracy until they encounter a path, a field, a
lake or other line at right angles to the course over which
they are moving. 0n arriving at this point, they must mark
the Spot they have reached‘by means of a numbered disc and
a colored paper strip which they carry with them. Time
plays no part.

The winner is the person arriving most accurately at the
correct point of arrival (determined in advance by orien-
teering experts). It should be noted that a margin of seventy-
five yards in every half-mile must be allowed for unavoid-
able errors. The competition distance should never exceed
one mile. Maps must not be used by the competitors.

An amusing variation of this form of competition con-
sists in allowing the competitors to attempt to keep to a
direction pointed out at the start ( by an arrow driven into
the ground for example) without using either a compass or
a map. In such a competition a distance of four hundred to
five hundred yards will be found sufficient.

A compass competition may also be'arranged over a
course in such a way that a given compass point is an-
nounced at the start which should be followed. On following
this direction the competitor will arrive at a row of num-
bered signs, whereupon he must mark the number he be-
lieves to lie in the correct direction. Approximately fifty to
one hundred yards beyond the first control (a marked-line
from the flags may be laid to the point in question) he will
receive a new compass bearing to follow. He proceeds thus
from control to control until he reaches the finishing point.

The score at each control is determined by the number of
signs between the correct sign and the one chosen by the

171

competitor. At the conclusion of the course, scores are
totalled for each contestant. The lowest total score wins.

Miniature Orienteering.* The competitors are to follow
compass courses specified in advance over short distances
(ten to seventy-five yards) looking for miniature controls.
This form of orienteering is suitable for school children and
afiords good training in walking by compass. It can be
practised over an area covering only a few hundred square
yards. The competitors are instructed to follow a certain
line by compass. At a given distance along this line a minia-
ture control is placed consisting of a small piece of card-
board with a code sign, perhaps attached to a tree or post.

The control may suitably be placed at the back of a tree.

 

The numerical order of the control should also he stated on
the sign so that the competitor can determine whether he has
missed a control and must return to look for it. The direc-
tion to the next control should also be stated. The competi-
tor then proceeds until the finishing point is reached. The
person having the fastest time around the course wins.
Other outdoor forms include:
Estimating Distances in Open Country. The competitors are
to estimate the distances to various objects observed in the
vicinity.
Calculating Distances by Means of a Watch or by Counting
Strides. The competitors are to decide, by means of a watch
or by counting strides, the exact location of a point at a
certain distance. i .

Competitive Orienteering

There are also various types of more developed orienteer-

ing contests which may be combined with the different meth-
ods of travel to make very interesting and enjoyable com-
petitive events.
Point Orienteering. The competitors follow a course on the
terrain marked by paper strips. They bring with them a map
of the area and a compass. They are to indicate on their
map the location of secret controls which they come across.
Point orienteering is an excellent form of competition for
exercising the capacity to follow a line on the map and make
rapid decisions with respect to one’s own position.

It is likewise an excellent form of promotion competition
for the general public since there is no danger of anyone
losing his way in the country, as the participants in such
competitions must follow a marked course.

Point orienteering is arranged in accordance with a
course that has been marked in advance. The length of the
course may suitably be three to four miles, and it may be
marked by colored strips so that it is easy to follow. Secret

controls are placed along the course and are marked hy
screens or colored strips at which each of the competitors
must mark the position of the control on the map. A point
orienteering course should be laid in such a way that it leads
as often as possible to fixed points in the territory (farms,
roads, streams, lakes or the like) to give the competitors an
opportunity to find their bearings.

The competitors are started at the rate of one or more per
minute, but individual times are noted at the finishing point.

Any mistakes made in marking the points in the territory
are penalized by the addition of time in accordance with a
special plan, for example, two minutes for every 1/16”
error. “The competition may be combined if desired with
questions on nature conservation at the finishing point, in
which the competitors may be required to answer correctly
two out of four questions. Incorrect answers may be penal-
ized by an addition of two minutes to the time. Questions
and suggestions for the answers may he posted at the start-
1ng pomt.

For this form of competition no wider knowledge con-
cerning the use of the compass is required than that com-
petitors should be capable of finding north and south on the
map. The competition may also he so arranged that the
competitors do not need to carry a compass. In such cases
an arrow indicating north is placed at each control point.
Similar arrows pointing north may also be placed between
the controls.

For minor competitions the controls may be “dead.” but
for larger ones, and particularly in promotion competitions.
they should be manned by officials to whom the competitors
must state the position of the control on the map. Any errors
in marking are noted on the cards carried by the competi-
tors. Units of error in certain fractions of an inch (1/16"
for example) may be indicated by a code so that the com-
petitors will not know the results of their judgment. For
example, letters may be employed so that an error of 1/16"
may he denoted by the letter A, 2/ 16” by the letter B, and
so on. Right marking may be denoted by a cipher.

Other competitive forms include:

Orienteering from a Station Point. From a station point
offering a wide visibility, certain landmarks are pointed out
to the competitors. The object is for the,competitors to in-
dicate the location of these landmarks on the map.

Line Orienteering. The competitors have to follow in the
terrain a line marked only on the map. Those who succeed
in accurately following this line will find a maximum num-
ber of controls in a certain order.

Score Orienteering. The competitors, using their map and
compass for finding their way, are to reach the highest pos-
sible score during a fixed maximum time by searching for a
number of controls of different point values in the vicinity.
Report Orienteering. The competitors are asked questions
on certain facts concerning the conditions (color of houses,
kinds of trees, and so on) in the area which can he an-
swered only after visiting the different spots.
Cross-Country Orienteering. The competitors start from a

certain point and endeavor to reach stated points on the
map in the shortest possible time, finding their own way
with the help of map and compass.

PERENNIALLY, the lore of the Indian,

with all its fine ideals and wood-
craft applications, catches the imagina-
tion of youth. Indian lore, under a
capable director, can play a vital role

in the summer program, lending itself
particularly well as a basis for integra-
tion of many fields—crafts, nature,
council fires and camp projects.

The program’s success depends on
the leader. One good leader is worth
ten poor ones, and should be paid ac-
cordingly, for not only will he make
this activity one of the more popular,
but might easily do so and serve in
some other capacity as well. Indian
dancing, more so than craft work, can-
not be learned from a book; every effort
should be made to secure a good dance
leader or train one for future years.

Indian lore is a two-fold program,
the craft side depending upon the danc-
ing side for success. Craft work is of
little value or interest unless the campers
are given an Opportunity to use their
creations. Bows and arrows are used on
the range; headdresses, tom-toms, bus-
tles are made for dancing; and the op-
portunity to use them should be pro-
vided. Indian council fires depend upon
regalia for atmosphere.

Craft Work

for dancing. Under the supervision of
an imaginative craft counselor, camp-
ers may use pound lots of feathers, bells,
beads and other items to fashion as
satisfactory a product as one made from
a kit, and at much less cost.

Headbands are easily assembled,
lending themselves especially well to
low cost and imagination. Loose feath-
ers are also used for arm and leg bands,
coup sticks, dance fans, shields, decora-
tions on tin-can rattles, and, more
elaborately, on bustles. Bells have
strong appeal to boys and give more
value per dollar than any other item
in charging the atmosphere.

In order to keep projects simple
enough to hold young, wandering minds
use cardboard for bases of bustles, head-
bands, dance fans and the like, with
the feathers easily attached by staples
or glue. Use crayons for decorating
breechcloths, and beads with larger
holes for younger boys.

Although totem poles are sometimes
good, avoid projects that require too
much time to complete. Although they
also require time, drums are proud pos-
sessions when completed. Moccasins
should be of the Blackfeet style, requir-
ing only a hand-stitched seam down
one side plus simple beadwork. Consult
any of the many good books for
numerous imaginative designs for other
craft projects.

not be produced in a short camp period,

The American Indian is a great lover
of games, particularly those having to
do with sports and those based on the
element of “chance.” Since the Indians
were grcat athletes, perhaps the favor-
itc games included running, jumping,
or shooting their bows and arrows. The
rules for games of chance are not clear-
ly described and were probably varied
according to tribe or use.

The equipmcnt used for games was
'fashioned out of natural materials such
as sticks, seeds, bones, pebbles, or corn
cobs. Color or small dots were added to
identify pieces belonging to individual

layers. Small flat bowls or leather bags
'wcre used as containers. Many of the
sticks were beautifully carved.

also prove popular. Vary the teaching
mctllods, keep it lively, encourage thc
boys and success is certainly yours,

'Indian Day in camp can be thc high-
light of the season, if it is well planned.
One cardinal rule for success is that
the whole camp participate. Use only
games that are easily supervised to
avoid arguments, which spoil the fun.

Campfires are where Indian lore really
shines. One of the first campfires of
the season should contain a note of the
Indian elcment to capture the camper’s
imagination. A later campfire should
give the boys an Opportunity to par-
ticipate. One of the best council fires
is the Give-Away Dance as outlined by
Mason in his book; sure to be the
season’s highlight.

Village dances, challenge dances and
games, and compctitive dancing are
also good program material for Indian
council fires. The staff might present
an entire dance program, carrying the
solo roles themselves, with the younger
boys filling in on the group dances.

certain number of small pebbles in a
shallow bowl—each one’s pebbles being
marked differently with small dots or a
color on one side. They are then poured
out on the ground and the players count
only the stones that land with decorat-
ed tops exposed. A similar game is
played by using cherry pits.

A Bundle of Sticks. A two-pouch bag

made of doeskin held together with a
strip of leather, and containing a num-
ber of small sticks, was worn by hang-
ing it over a belt at the waist. It was
carried by a visiting warrior, who on
arrival danced in the council ring.
When he completed the dance, lie scat-
tered the sticks on the ground. Thc
manner in which the sticks fell had cer-
tain significance, even to peace or war
between the tribes. '

Some tribes gave sticks as an invita-
tion to ceremonies. The sticks were
sometimes carved with symbols sacred
to their tribe. This idea may be used in

7 ACTS about nature can be the basis

of games which not only are fun
but which encourage careful observas
tion on the part of the players and
reveal facts about
which in themselves can prove exciting.
They can be a helpful part of a nature
program, or awaken interest in the or-
ganization of such a program.
Only a few games are described here.
Others can be devised by leaders them-
selves, or found in nature and camping

the out-of-doors

publications. (See list on inside front
cover of this issue.)

Hold the Front.1 This is a hiking game
which can be played by from four to
fifteen players, age ten and up. Players
travel along a trail in single file. The
leader asks a question about something
observed along the trail, such as, “What
kind of a tree is this?” “Point out three
minerals in the granite.” lf Number 1
in the line knows the proper answer, he
holds his place in front. If he fails he
goes to the rear of the line. Number .2
then gets a chance to answer. Each
player failing to answer goes to the
rear of the line, and the person first
answering correctly is Number 1.

Trailing. The number of persons play-
ing this game should be kept to ten.
Large numbers of campers can be di-
vided into smaller groups, each playing
independently of the others. One per-
son starts ahead of the group and walks

carelessly through the woods, making"

no attempt to hide evidence of his pas-
sage. At the end of ten minutes he sits
down to wait. The other players start
at this time, and try to find him—by
means of broken twigs, footprints and
other signs. They can follow him as a
group, or scatter for individual trailing
-—the first one to find him being the
winner and required to explain his
achievement.

This game can be varied by the lay-
ing of a nature trail by the player being
pursued. See following note.

Laying a Nature Trail.1 The following
are devices for “nature trails” as dif-
ferentiated from the more usual “hare
and hound” trail of popcorn, beans and
so on:

TRAI L. ST RAIGHT

@weaw

RIG HT TURN

LEFT TURN

Use trail signs such as “duck on a
rock” (one rock on top of another; see
illustration), bent twigs and hunched
grass. Do not put blazes on trees for
ordinary trailing games.

Make tracks with tracking irons (an-
imal tracks or signs made of iron placed
on the end of a stick and used to make
impressions in the ground).

Use compass directions, given from
point to point. If the directions are
carefully followed a given spot will be
reached.

Nature Scavenger Hunt.1 Ten to one
hundred players, ages ten up. If the
group is large, divide it into teams with
six to eight in each team. Give each
team a list of things to be collected and
a paper bag to hold them. Allow five
to thirty minutes, depending on the list
of things to be brought back. Penalize
groups not back within a specified time.
Each item on the list should be checked
by asking each team to display the ob-
jects one_ at a time. The winning team
is the one which has secured the greatest
number of the objects on the list.

Nature Scouting.1 Twenty to eighty
players, ages ten up. On a map of the
camp area (or if the occasion is a pic-
nic, the picnic area), designate several
points about equally distant from the
starting point. Divide the group into
small teams of four or five people, and
send each team on a scouting trip to
a different point. Allow about fifteen
minutes for the trip and return. After
the teams have returned, call for.reports
on what was seen. A picnic meeting or
campfire program is a good occasion
for .-such reporting. Interest is highest
when groups report interesting things
in sufficient detail to be recognizable by

identification was not made.

Who Arn I .91 Unlimited number of play-
ars, ages ten up. Place numbered tags
on objects along a trail or within a re-
stricted area. Tags should be placed so
that they can be readily found. Players
are given blank cards and instructed to
find all tags and note on cards the
objects on which they were found.

Bird Identification. Divide players into
groups of five, each with a captain to
act as scorekeeper and spokesman for
his group. On a bird-spotting walk in
the woods or across the fields; the first
group to identify any bird receives three
points; if the group can offer any cor-
rect information about the bird’s habits,
it wins an additional two points. Twenty.-
five points constitute one game. Identi-
fication of each bird must be made to
the leader of the trip, who awards the
points. This game can be played with
plants, animals, insects, trees and so on.

Twig Matching.2 This is a good indoor
game for rainy days or social occasions.
Obtain several kinds of twigs eight to
twelve inches long. Cut into two parts.
Mount the lower half on a board. Scat-
ter the other halves on a table. At a
given signal, the players observe closely
one of the twigs and then run to the
unmounted group to get the other half.
If wrong half is brought back, player

tries again. This game requires close
r

observation. Leaves may be used in the
same way, or flowers with short stems
may be fitted to longer stems, or leaves
to leaf scars.

Iack-in-the-box.2 A branch or flower is
held up quickly from the back of a box.
The players write down the names.
See which team gets the highest average.

Bird Flight.3 This game is designed
primarily for the study of the color and
size of nature birds. Choose the bird
you prefer to make and draw an out-
line as though you were looking at it
from above with its wings stretched
wide. Now fold the paper so the fold

is on the side of the body of the bird
and cut it out so that each wing of the
bird is exactly the same size when it is
unfolded. Use this for your pattcrn and
trace around it on cardboard and cut
out. Bracc it underneath with a few
sticks of light wood by gluing the braces
to the cardboard. There should be
braces across the wings and from bill
to tail. Leave a small notch in the brace
running from bill to tail about half-way
down the stick.

Choose any twig that will bend a little
without breaking and use about two
feet of it as a propeller. This is done
by tying a string eight inches long to~
the twig, leaving a loop one inch long
at the loose end.

You are now ready to put your bird
in flight. The bird will look like a mono-
plane colored as near the color of the
bird as possible. Hook the notch in the
bird brace to the loop in string. Pull
the bird with the right hand far back
and hold the twig firmly in the left. The
twig will bend and, upon releasing the
bird with the right hand, it will take
flight in the direction it is pointed.

Many rules may be used for this game.
One might consist in a group of contest-
ants racing a number of birds across a
field as fast as possible with a minimum
number of starts and stops. Another
variation might be to identify the plant
on which the bird lights. The game
should be limited to the birds that are
native to that part of the country.

File Your Way 0ut

lnevitably there comes a time when
the recreation leader feels that his pro-
gram needs rejuvenation; that he’s
caught in a steel trap of routine. It
seems to me that when this has occurred,
‘the quickest and most rewarding man-
'ner of escape is to “file your way out.”
There are few better ways of diagnos-
ing a recreation program than that of
thoroughly checking over the depart-
ment files. This can come in the form of
a “cleaning-out” process. It might be
a good idea to be deliberate and slow
in going over the files.

When we make our files too much of

a storehouse, they are ineffective. Good
files contain only the fresh material

MARCH 1954

which can actually be used. In order to
make'the files most effective, it is very
important to have a thorough knowl-
edge of its contents.

Checking the files also offers an op-
portunity to check over various mate-
rial which has been filed by other mem-
bers of the recreation staff.

On many occasions a recreation
leader reads an interesting article, finds
a good recipe, or comes across some
program aid. This material finds a place
in the files before it is thoroughly di-
gested. The good intention is there all
right, but the leader very often forgets
about it completely. i

When I took my first job as a recrea-

tion leader, I spent several weeks going
over the files. This proved to be of out-
standing benefit to me. It is the best
way to familiarize yourself with a pro-
gram.

Some recreation departments have a
newspaper clipping file. A regular re-
view and study of it can serve many
needs. It is also a good reference for
board members, city officials, or the
people of the community. It is one of
the best sources to evaluate a recreation
program.

The next time you feel your program
needs something, why not try to “file
your way out?”———DAVE ZOOK, Superin-
tendent of Recreation, Salina, Kansas.

Thc year just passed was one of many
.uccesses for professional workers and
'ecreation agencies In retrospect we
ee much encouragement and hope for
hc future. In the first place, the total
number of tax-supported positions in-
reased. The number of executive posi-
ions filled was favorable and salaries
mproved. The salary range for execu-
ive positions filled was $3,500 to
£6,800. The median salary increased
rom $4,250 to $4,500 over the preced-
ng year and is the highest yet reported.
f es, it is still too low, but it is moving
n the right direction. Then, too, these
rositions. are mostly in small towns.
"ifty-one per cent are in cities under
0,000 population, sixty-nine per cent
Lnder 15,000, eighty-eight per cent
.nder 25,000 and ninety-two per cent
.nder 50,000 population. Only eight
Ier cent of these placements were in
ities over 50,000.

The executive positions pending at
me close of 1953 and carried over into
954 were also in the smaller cities.
lver half were in communities of
0,000 population or under. All were
nder 50,000 and only three were over
5,000 population. The median salary
)r the unfilled executive positions at
1e close of 1953 was $4,000. A look at
1e salary demands of the men execu-
ves on the available list at that time
ives some indication of the difhculty
1ese cities are having in filling their
acancies with qualified recreation ex-
:utives. Most of the men on the avail-
ble list classified as executives at the
lose of the year wanted more than
4,000, the median salary for the ex-
:utive positions that were open. Well

1953

over half of the candidates would con-
sider new positions only at a minimum
of $5,000. Over a quarter of them
would consider nothing under $6,000.
Executive positions were filled in
twenty different states, including all of
the eight field districts. About one-half
of these were in cities west of Chicago.
Positions of various types were filled in
thirty-five states, and others involved
overseas service with the U. S. Army,
the State Department and the Air Force.
Positions were received from the Dis-
trict of Columbia and all the forty-eight
states except two. More positions were
filled in institutions——mental hospitals
and state training schools.
Municipalities have found it increas-
ingly difficult to recruit qualified work-
ers, partly because of the competition
for the best recreation leadership be-
tween public and private agencies. Also,
the increased demand for recreation
personnel in state mental hospitals and
other areas of recreation service is add-
ing to the difficulty. Frequently the
positions are more adequately defined,
working conditions more attractive and
salaries higher in these related fields.
Some cities lost good prospects to other
municipalities because the officials in
the latter seemed to be better organized,
knew what they wanted and in general
impressed the candidates with the fa-
vorable conditions and attitude which
prevailed, making the atmosphere con-
ducive to the development of a good
public park and recreation service. The
number of students graduating from
professional recreation curriculums de-
creased, adding further to the difficulty.
0n the other hand, personnel did in-
crease and salaries also increased. In-
service training continued to advance.
A new publication, I n-Service Training

W. C. Sutherland

for Parks and Recreation—-—0bjectives
and Resources,* was prepared jointly by
committees of the National Recreation
Association and the American Institute
of Park Executives. The suggestions in-
corporated in this publication indicate
a broadening conception of the possi-
bilities for training on the part of the
park and recreation executives. Addi-
tional publications are in process by the
National Recreation Association’s Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Recruit-
ment, Training and Placement and will
have to do with (1) training play-
ground leaders and (2) training com-
munity-center personnel. The commit-
tee has other projects underway dealing
with such subjects as: policies and prac-
tices, recruiting and selection.

More liberal policies have been noted
with reference to residence require-
ments. For example, Huntington Park,
California, has received applications
from all over the United States for the
position of recreation executive; and
comprehensive written exa m i n a ti o n s
will be conducted in fifteen different
cities. Most of the cities appointing rec-
reation executives have waived all resi-
dence requirements.

Evidence in general, and growing out
of the Southern Regional Study in par-
ticular, indicates that the demand for
qualified recreation personnel in the
next five years will exceed the supply
unless the professional recreation train-
ing centers step up their production,
both in quantity and in quality. Likc-
wise, the ability of cities to bring sub-
standard salaries up to date and im-
prove working conditions in general
will determine the extent to which va-
cancies will be filled by qualified pe0ple.

Dr. Henry S. Curtis, nationally known
luthority and one of the pioneers of the
'ecreation movement in America, died
It the age of eighty-three in Aurora,
Dhio.

Dr. Curtis was active in the organiza-
ion of the Playground Association of
\merica, (later to become the National
iecreation Association) in 1906, be-
mine its first secretary-treasurer, and
hen the second vice-president. During
115 long and outstanding career, which
)egan when he was assistant director of
\'ew York City playgrounds in 1898, he
:erved as supervisor of playgrounds
n the District of Columbia, director of
iygiene and physical training for the
[mm of Missouri, joined the faculty at
.he University of Michigan, and later

MARCH 1954

taught recreation at Cornell, Columbia,
and Harvard.

He was the author of several books
and articles on recreation, and in recent
years devoted much of his attention to
the recreation problems of the aged.

In a resolution, the board of directors
of the National Recreation Association
stated. “Dr. Curtis’ service in the na-
tional recrcation movement covered a
broad range of interests over a long
span of years. He worked vigorously
and persistently for play for children,
for recreation for rural America, and
for recreation for our older citizens.
His service has left its definite imprint
on the recreation movement and will be
long remembered.”

S. W ales Dixon, former NRA field

secretary and recreation director at
Hartford, Connecticut, died at the age
of eighty-two.

Mr. Dixon was born in Fairport, New
York, and developed a great interest
and exceptional ability in sports as a
boy. This interest took him to Roches-
ter, New York, where he joined the
YMCA. In 1893 he went to the YMCA
in Hartford as assistant gym instructor.
It was during that year that Dr. James
Naismith brought his Springfield Col-
lege basketball team to Hartford and
introduced the new game. Mr. Dixon
then coached his city’s first basketball
team, and later introduced softball
there. He has often been called Hart-
ford’s best all-around athlete.

In 1914 he became city recreation
director, a post he held until 1921 when
he joined the NRA (then called the
Playground and Recreation Association
of America) as the New England field
secretary. The old park concept still
existed at that time, and Mr. Dixon was
instrumental in promoting more active
recreation use of parks and better quali-

fied leadership.

He returned to Hartford in 1934 and
was in charge of the training of recrea-
tion supervisors until his retirement in

1948.

Dr. Helen L. CoOps, nationally known
in the field of physical and health edu-
cation and a University of Cincinnati
faculty member for thirty years, died at
Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati.

She attended Connecticut College for
Women from 1918 to 1920, then trans-
ferred to Barnard College, where she
received the bachelor of science degree
in 1922. Postgraduate studies in Teach-
ers College, Columbia University, led
to master of arts and doctor of philoso-
phy degrees.

In 1923 she went to Cincinnati Uni-
versity as instructor in physical and
health education and, through a succes-
sion of promotions, became a full pro-
fesSor in 1950. She was one of the origi-
nators and director of the university’s
annual Greek games, traditional com-
petition betwecn freshman and sopho-
more women. Interested in music and
the fine arts, Dr. Coops lectured in this
field.

During World War II she was on for-
eign duty with the American Red Cross.

Through her years in Cincinnati, she
received numerous local, state, regional,
and national honors.

Dr. William L. Lloyd received final
tribute from city ofiicials, his former
colleagues, professional associates, and
a host of friends when funeral services
for the retired director of the Cabrillo
Beach Marine Museum, San Pedro,
were held last December.

Born in Springtown, Osborn County,
Kansas, in 1880, Dr. Lloyd was gradu-
ated from the University of Pennsyl-
vania’s College of Dentistry and prac-
ticed his profession for many years. He
came to Los Angeles in 1922 and joined
the former department of playgrounds
and recreation in 1934 as the first di-
rector of Los Angeles’ Municipal Ma-
rine Museum, then located in a small
room on the old Sunset Pier, Venice.
Under his guidance, the Marine Mu-
seum expanded until it became neces-
sary to move it into larger quarters at
Cabrillo Beach where it achieved world-
wide renown. Dr. Lloyd made a nota-
ble contribution to its success when he
donated to it his fine personal sea shell
collection. He retired as the museum’s
director in 1950, and was instructor' in
biology at Los Angeles State College
during the academic year 1950-51. He
returned to Cabrillo Beach Marine Mu-
seum late in 1951 as concessionaire, and
advisor for the recreation and park de.

Nature Leaders9 Workshop

The Los Angeles City Recreation and
Park Department is currently sponsor-
ing a “Workshop for Nature Leaders”
which consists of a series of eight Wed-
nesday evening lectures, illustrated with
slides or demonstrations, and table dis-
plays which are changed weekly, on
birds, rocks, nature crafts, reptiles,
mammals, fish, native plants, insects,
shells, nature games and books. David
Gray, director of the Fern Dell Nature
Museum is in charge of the workshOp.

Hospitality Box

Mrs. Elizabeth Robbins, a former
NRA Sponsor from West Orange, New
Jersey, keeps a “Hospitality Box” in her
home. The box itself is a simple metal
bread box which she decorated at-
tractively with Pennsylvania Dutch de-
signs and the words “Lord, grant
enough to serve our ends—with some
left over for our friends” on the out-
side, and “Hospitality Box—.—Keep Me
Filled!” on the inside of the cover. Into
her box she puts such items as instant
coffee, tea bags, cocoa, rye crisp, may-
onnaise, canned chicken, fruit, paper
napkins, jam, crackers, and cookies—to
be used as gifts or refreshments when
friends dr0p in. This idea, which would
make an interesting project for women’s
craft groups, has many possibilities for
adaptation to recreation center pro-
grams. Why not try a hospitality box
at camp (it could be stocked with spe-
cial treats and opened as a surprise at
a Special program); or at club meet-
ings; or to take on a visit to shut-ins.

Don’t-Do-It-Yourself Movement
for Business

While the do-it-yourself movement is
becoming bigger among consumers, the
don’t-do-it-yourself idea is even more

184

important in business and industry, ac-
cording to the “York Report,” published
by York Engineering and Construc-
tion and York-Gillespie Manufacturing
companies of Pittsburgh.

Though householders are “expanding
expansion attics, painting furniture,
making like carpenters, slip-covering
their sofas, cutting each other’s hair,”
business is finding it pays to hire ex-
perts to perform special services. “In-
dustry’s swing to not doing things for
itself—although somewhat obscured by
the sparks from the consumer do-it-
yourself pinwheel—has been quietly
moving ahead . . . more and more other
functions are being put into the hands
of those who can do them best.”

Businesses normally obtain services
of other firms specializing in law, taxes,
engineering and advertising and now,
in increasing frequency, businesses are
contracting with other companies to
train salesmen, handle personnel, con-
duct labor negotiations, book travel res-
ervations, manage in-plant eating fa-
cilities, supervise safety programs, main-
tain quality controls, conduct process
and product research, ascertain em-
ployee and public attitudes and solve
other problems, the report points out.

Hawaiian Notes

Two very interesting items in the
Playground News, monthly publica-
tion of the Honolulu Recreation Divi-
sion, told about a unique workshop and
a graduation celebration. The worksh0p
—on how to make native ,Hawaiian in-
struments—was attended by twenty-
eight staff members; and many outside
resources were used to make it a suc-
cess: a local craftsman gave profes-
sional advice; a dance teacher gave a
lecture and performed ancient dances;
someone else sent bamboo to be used
for one of the instruments; and so on.

One hundred and thirty women—
mothers, grandmothers and one great
grandmother—received certificates at
the graduation exercises for the moth-
ers’ swimming classes. An all-day pro-
gram marked the event with formal ex-
ercises, recognition for the volunteers
who helped make the classes possible, a
lavish buffet luncheon prepared by the
mothers, music, dancing, and swim-
ming.

New Camp for Older People

Bronx House-Emanuel Camps has be-
gun construction of a summer camp
facility designed eSpecially for people
over sixty-five. It will be the fourth unit
at the agency’s camp site at C0pake,
New York.

According to Charles Ansell, camp
director, the entire unit—building, ter-
rain, room interiors—will be built ex-

clusively for the comfort and conveni-
ence of older men and women. Two-
Week vacations will be provided, and
about seventy-five persons will be ac-
commodated during each period.

Facts and Figures . . .

0 Mobile, Alabama—Contracts have
been let for a swimming pool at Balti-
more Park to accommodate 260 swim-
mers at a time and fill a long standing
summer program need.

0 Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin—A ninety-
five-acre site has been selected for a
huge swimming pool and picnic area.
The wedge-shape pool will be 150 feet
long, 60 feet wide at the shallow end and
50 feet at the deep end.

0 Dayton, Ohio—New quarters to re-
place the over-burdened present facili-
ties of the Dayton Boys Club, estimated
to cost $467,000, will be partially paid
for through public subscription. During
1952, this Community Chest agency had
a membership of 1,204 boys who paid
142,336 visits to the club rooms. At an
average of two hours and forty minutes
per visit, the total cost of running the
club amounted to less than nine cents
per hour per boy.

0 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma— One

hundred and forty-five people, repre-
senting thirty-nine agencies, participat-
ed in a recent recreation leadership
training course in“ social recreation con-
ducted by Anne Livingston of the NRA.
There were representatives from thin
teen churches, eight schools and col-
leges, three hospitals, and many private
agencies as well as from the municipal
recreation department.

0 Alameda, California—A $106,000
park improvement program will include
developing regular park features, a
$35,000 clubhouse, and a swimming
pooL

o Tacoma, Washington—Part of the
$500,000 improvement program will be
spent for a combined building for serv-
ice and for golden-agers in downtown
Wright Park. Two new playground rec-
reation buildings, four wading pools, an
animal building at the zoo, and a $200,-
000 salt water swimming pool are some
of the other projects.

0 Cincinnati, Ohio—Two new commu-
nity buildings have been built on play-
grounds adjacent to pools: the Corry-
ville building at a cost of $85,078 and

Children and T V —Mukiug the Most of
It is a new forty-page bulletin which has
just been published by the Association
for Childhood Education International
in response to requests of parents and
teachers for immediate help on the
problem.

Outstanding educators familiar with
children and with TV have combined to
present a positive and constructive ap-
proach to television and family living.

The research that has been done in
connection with children and television
is covered by Paul Witty. Florence
Brumbaugh discusses the effect of tele-
vision advertising. Alyce Seekamp
writes of the teacher’s role in utilizing
in and out of school experiences with
TV. A variety of anecdotes of family
solutions to TV in their homes rein-
forces the points made throughout the
bulletin. Published in February 1954,
pages 40, price $.75; 20 per cent dis-
count on lots of twenty-five or more.

Educational TV

“During the past year a most signifi-
cant deveIOpment in American com-
munications and education took place:
the first two non-commercial educa-
tional television stations in the country,
at Houston and Los Angeles, went on
the air. Nearly fifty applications to
build stations have been filed with the
Federal Communications Commission
and almost. thirty permits have been
granted. Eventually the whole nation
could be nearly blanketed with the out-
put of educational stations, for the FCC
has reserved twenty-five channels ex-
clusively for education.

“The progress educational TV has
made in less than two years is great
news, for it shows that Americans are
working hard to take advantage of an
opportunity that will leave its mark on
many generations to come: it will help

to provide education and understanding
that are essential if we are to fulfill 011]
obligations as citizens. And with edu‘
cation and understanding, we car
fashion an era of opportunity that coulé
outshadow all those the world has.
known before.

“So determined are many communi-
ties to get their educational TV stations
in operation, that they have planned
programs long in advance of the com-
pleted fund raising and purchasing of
equipment. Detroit is a good example.
Specific programs, with titles, have been
worked out to fill six hours a day. These
are shows that the pe0ple of Detroit
have said, through the educational TV
program committee, that they want, not
what someone thinks they want. Sub-
jects include the symphony, galleries
and museums, even a show on how to
glamorize housework.

“Communities are discovering that
they have many program resources they
never realized were in their own back-
yards. To deveIOp them will take in-
genuity and imagination.”—DR. MIL-
TON EISENHOWER, in National AM V ET,
January 1954.

' Films

* The recreation department in Dodge
City, Kansas, has completed a film cov-
ering the 1953 recreation program.

* World Series films of 1953 are now
ready, and are available to all ABC
teams and leagues at no cost other than

Also added to the large ABC film li-
brary is another short subject “Building

mond prospects are trained by the

dians at their amazing training camps
to take care of hundreds of young hope-
fuls. Shipping charges average $3.00
per round trip for each fivc hundred

Titten by a recreation leader from a

cws. Boh Oberreich is co-founder and
irector of the famous Madison Square
hildren’s Theatre in New York City.
His own account of this interesting and

sue of RECREATION, under the matter-
E-fact title, “Unique Children’s Thea-
8.”)

The Magic Lake is the story of {our
:d-hloodcd hoys in the northern woods.
nything can happen, and does, in this
trilling tale of a “summer to beat all

Immers.” For youngsters ages eight to
velve.

Mr. Oherreich was asked whether

imstances connected with its writing.
Yes,” he said, “Three hundred alert

BASEBALL

THE PICTORIAL BASEBALL INSTRUCTOR,
Lalnont Buchanan. E. P. Dutton and

Company, Incorporated, New York 10.
Pp. 124. $2.95.

BATTING As MAJOR LEAGUERS DO IT,

Clifford W. Brown. Soccer Associates,

10 Overlook Terrace, New York 33.
Pp. 82. $2.50.

Spring usually brings a rash of books
on baseball; and the two mentioned
here are among the early birds in 1954.
The Pictorial Baseball Instructor is a
book of action photOgraphs of well-
known ball players. It shows, by means
of these pictures, just how each posi-
tion is played—on three levels: college;
big league; little league—and it offers
forty rules “to enable you to play any
position.”

Batting As Major Leaguers Do It, on
the other hand, concentrates on tech-
niques that are “murder to all pitchers.”
It is a book designed to be of help to
coaches in high schools, prep schools
and colleges, and presents the funda-
mentals of batting in easy-to-learn ex-
ercises that the boys can use to help
themselves on their own time.

Visual Aids for the Public Service

RaChel Marshall Goetz. Public Ad-
ministration Service, 1313 East 60th

Street, Chicago 37, Illinois. Pp. 89.
$3.25.

Welcome, indeed, is this good prac-
tical manual containing the “know-
how” of using visual aids—so impor-
tant nowadays in the telling of your
story! Prepared by Mr. Goetz, as a re-
sult of a pilot study of the improved use
of the tools of communication—con-
ducted by the Public Administration
Clearing House in Chicago—it covers
bulletin boards, posters, displays, gra-
phics, films, film strips and so on, tell-
ing how to utilize these media to: arouse
attention; convey information; organ-
ize ideas; motivate action. It explains

simply, and with the help of amus1ng
sketches, the essentials of obtaining
good results; and, although not inex-
pensive, is worth the price. Adminis-
trators and program leaders alike
would do well to add this to their work-
ing libraries.

things appeal to all ages. During his

Make-It Book

Simon and Schuster, New York 20.
Pp. 256. $2.95.

A book that can be a boon to harried
mothers of restless offspring on that
rainy afternoon, or to camp counselors
or other leaders of children’s groups.
There is something for every-age child
to do or to make——-with colored illus-
trations showing just how to proceed.
A section on the use of basic tools tells
how the right tools, properly used, can
make doing things simpler. Suggestions
also include the use of second-hand ma-
terials, throwaways—money savers——
for the creation of some useful or en-
joyable product. Anyway, what boy
wouldn’t like to make a boat that floats,
or what little girl could resist turning
a paper box into doll furniture? Mak-
ing a miniature garden, or a chemical

garden, is fun too. What about an
Easter basket? You’d better investigate.

If you are interested in weaving, you
should know about this periodical which

what Aaklae weaving is, or about the
new man-made fiber which has been de-
veloped for handweavers, or the sched-

June? If not, you’d better look into
this!

vides practical guidance at every stag

drying, firing, decorating, glazing, an.
in the selection of a kiln. Stage-by
stage photographs accompany the text
and make Miss Drawbell’s instruction
extraordinarily clear.

Wrapped in sleep...wrapped in love

Day’s end for tiny legs and arms . . . the bedtime story
told, prayers said, the tired little body held for a
moment’s hug, then tucked into bed . . .

Seal the day now with her good—night kiss and let
her drift away into slumber, safe and secure.

Security is the deepest need of our living, and its
greatest reward. To provide it for those we love is a
privilege possible only in a country like ours.
And this is how we make America secure: by making
- our own homes so. One secure family circle touching
another builds a secure land.

Saving for security is easy!

Here’s a savings system that really
works—~the Payroll Savings Plan for
investing in United States Savings
Bonds.

This is all you (10. Go to your com-
pany’s pay ofiice, choose the amount
you want to save—a couple of dollars
a payday, or as much as you wish.
That money will be set aside for you
before you even draw your pay. And
automatically invested in Series “E”
Savings Bonds which are turned
over to you.

If you can save only $3.75 a week
on the Plan, in 9 years and 8111011ths
you will have $2,137.30. For your
sake, and your family’s, too, how

about signing up today?
